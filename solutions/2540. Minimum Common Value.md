### Clarifying Questions
To ensure we're both on the same page, I'll need to clarify a few points:
1. What are the input constraints?
2. What kind of data structures will the inputs be in?
3. Should we return -1 if there is no common value?

Assuming the common interpretation:
- The inputs will be two lists of integers.
- We need to find the smallest common value between the two lists.
- If no common value exists, we are to return -1.

### Strategy
Here's a step-by-step strategy to solve the problem:

1. **Convert Lists to Sets**: Converting lists to sets allows us to efficiently find common elements.
2. **Find Intersection**: Use the set intersection operation to find common elements.
3. **Return Minimum**: If the intersection is non-empty, return the smallest element from the intersection. Otherwise, return -1.

### Time Complexity
1. **Converting Lists to Sets**: This operation is O(n + m) where n and m are the lengths of the two lists.
2. **Intersection of Sets**: Finding the intersection of two sets is O(min(n, m)).
3. **Finding the Minimum**: This is O(k), where k is the number of common elements. In the worst case, k could be min(n, m).

Overall, the time complexity is O(n + m), which is efficient given that we need to examine all elements at least once.

### Code

Here's the Python code to implement the above strategy:

```python
def min_common_value(list1, list2):
    set1 = set(list1)
    set2 = set(list2)
    
    common_elements = set1.intersection(set2)
    
    if not common_elements:
        return -1
    
    return min(common_elements)

# Example usage
list1 = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
list2 = [15, 25, 35, 40, 45]

print(min_common_value(list1, list2))  # Output: 40
```

### Explanation of Code
1. **Conversion to Sets**: `set1 = set(list1)` and `set2 = set(list2)` convert the input lists to sets.
2. **Intersection**: `common_elements = set1.intersection(set2)` calculates the common elements.
3. **Check for Common Elements**: If `common_elements` is empty, return -1.
4. **Minimum of Common Elements**: If there are common elements, return the minimum using `min(common_elements)`.

This solution is straightforward, efficient, and leverages Pythonâ€™s built-in set operations to ensure optimal performance.
