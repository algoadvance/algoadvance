title:  Check if There is a Valid Path in a Grid-out
permalink: /s1391
---

You are given an `m x n` grid. Each cell of the grid represents a street. The street of grid[i][j] can be:

- `1` which means a street connecting the left cell and the right cell.
- `2` which means a street connecting the upper cell and the lower cell.
- `3` which means a street connecting the left cell and the lower cell.
- `4` which means a street connecting the right cell and the lower cell.
- `5` which means a street connecting the left cell and the upper cell.
- `6` which means a street connecting the right cell and the upper cell.

You will initially start at the top-left cell (0, 0). A valid path in the grid is a path which starts from the top left and is able to reach the bottom-right cell of the grid using the streets. You are allowed to move to one of the four adjacent cells in the grid using the street's connections.

Return True if there is a valid path in the grid, otherwise return False.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Should we assume all grid values are valid street types as described in the problem?
2. Are there any constraints on the size of the grid (`m` and `n`)?

## Strategy

1. Define the possible moves for each street type.
2. Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the grid from the top-left cell (0, 0).
3. For each cell, check all possible moves allowed by the current street type.
4. Ensure that the move remains within bounds of the grid and connects validly according to the adjoining cell's street type.
5. If you reach the bottom-right cell, return True. If you exhaust all possibilities without reaching the bottom-right cell, return False.

## Code

```python
def hasValidPath(grid):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    
    # Directions maps to the new cell and corresponding valid moves
    directions = {
        1: {'L': (0, -1, [1, 4, 6]), 'R': (0, 1, [1, 3, 5])},
        2: {'U': (-1, 0, [2, 3, 4]), 'D': (1, 0, [2, 5, 6])},
        3: {'L': (0, -1, [1, 4, 6]), 'D': (1, 0, [2, 5, 6])},
        4: {'R': (0, 1, [1, 3, 5]), 'D': (1, 0, [2, 5, 6])},
        5: {'L': (0, -1, [1, 4, 6]), 'U': (-1, 0, [2, 3, 4])},
        6: {'R': (0, 1, [1, 3, 5]), 'U': (-1, 0, [2, 3, 4])}
    }
    
    # BFS initialization
    from collections import deque
    queue = deque([(0, 0)])
    visited = {(0, 0)}

    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        if (x, y) == (m - 1, n - 1):
            return True
        
        for direction, (dx, dy, validNextStreets) in directions[grid[x][y]].items():
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n and (nx, ny) not in visited and grid[nx][ny] in validNextStreets:
                visited.add((nx, ny))
                queue.append((nx, ny))
                
    return False

# Example usage
grid = [[2,4,3],[6,5,2]]
print(hasValidPath(grid))  # Output: True
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(m * n) since each cell is visited at most once in the traversal process. The space complexity is also O(m * n) due to the queue used for BFS and the visited set.
