title:  Count Days Without Meetings-out
permalink: /s3169
---

A company has a calendar for scheduling meetings. Each meeting is represented as a tuple (start_day, end_day), where start_day and end_day are inclusive. We need to count the number of days that do not have any meetings scheduled.

**Input:**

- A list of tuples `meetings` where each tuple is in the form `(start_day, end_day)`.

**Output:**

- An integer representing the number of days without any meetings scheduled.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of days**: Are there any constraints on the range of days (e.g., 1 to 365 for a year)?
2. **Overlap**: Can the meetings overlap, and what should be done in such cases?
3. **Edge cases**: What is the input if there are no meetings?
4. **Calendar days**: Are we assuming that the company operates 365 days a year, or should we take a different range into account?

Assuming the standard problem setup for a year (days range from 1 to 365) and meetings can overlap:

### Code

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def count_days_without_meetings(meetings):
    # Let's first initialize a list to represent each day of the year:
    days = [0] * 366  # 0 to 365 index, only using 1 to 365 (1-based indexing)
    
    # Mark days having meetings
    for start, end in meetings:
        for day in range(start, end + 1):
            days[day] = 1  # Mark this day as occupied
    
    # Count the days that do not have any meetings
    no_meeting_days = days[1:366].count(0)
    
    return no_meeting_days

# Example usage
meetings = [(1, 3), (10, 20), (15, 25)]
print(count_days_without_meetings(meetings))  # Output will depend on the given meetings
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialize a list `days`**: A list of size 366 where each index represents a day of the year. All elements are initialized to 0, indicating no meetings scheduled initially.
2. **Mark meeting days**: Iterate through the list of meetings and for each meeting, mark the corresponding days in the `days` list as 1 (indicating a meeting is scheduled on that day).
3. **Count unmarked days**: After marking all the meeting days, count the number of days that are still 0 (unmarked), which represent the days without any meetings.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is O(D + N*M), where:

- `D` is the number of days in the calendar (constantly 365 here).
- `N` is the number of meetings.
- `M` is the average length of the meetings.

In the worst case, each day within each meeting interval is processed, leading to linear time complexity with a multiplicative factor based on meeting intervals. This is efficient given the constraints.
