(Leetcode problem 2959) 

Given a positive integer `n`, return the number of different sets of closing branches-out that can be formed.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What does the term "closing branches-out" mean in the context of this problem?
2. Is there a specific pattern or rule that "closing branches-out" should follow?
3. Are there any constraints on the value of `n`?

Given that the problem statement is not clear regarding the terminology "closing branches-out", I would typically clarify these questions with the interviewer. However, if we treat this as a combinatorial problem or maybe one related to possible ways to balance parentheses (like generating valid parenthesis pairs), here's a general approach we might use.

Let's assume the problem is related to generating all combinations of balanced parentheses (which is a common problem with such a description on coding platforms).

## Strategy

1. **Understand the Problem**: If the problem is similar to generating valid parentheses combinations, it's equivalent to the 'Catalan number' problem, where we find the nth Catalan number.
2. **Catalan Number**: The nth Catalan number is given by the formula:
   \[
   C_n = \frac{(2n)!}{(n+1)!n!}
   \]
   This gives the number of ways to form valid parentheses combinations.

3. **Implementation Strategy**:
   - Use a mathematical library to calculate factorial values to compute the nth Catalan number.
   - Implement the formula in code.

## Code

```python
import math

def catalan_number(n):
    return math.comb(2*n, n) // (n + 1)

# Example usage
n = 3
print(catalan_number(n))  # Should output 5, as there are 5 ways to balance 3 pairs of parentheses.
```

## Time Complexity

Calculating combinations and factorials has a time complexity of `O(n)`, and for practical uses where `n` is relatively small (common in programming challenges), this approach is efficient.

1. **Mathematical Calculation**: Calculating factorial and combination are `O(n)`.
2. **Space Complexity**: Uses only a constant amount of additional space, so `O(1)`.

Please verify the problem context and constraints to ensure we are addressing the right problem. If further clarification is provided, the approach might differ.
