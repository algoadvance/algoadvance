title:  Maximum Length of Subarray With Positive Product-out
permalink: /s1567
---
Given an array of integers `nums`, find the maximum length of a subarray where the product of all its elements is positive.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the array contain zeroes?**
   - Yes, the array can include zeroes, which will reset any ongoing subarray product consideration since a product involving zero is zero.
   
2. **What should be the result if the array is empty?**
   - If the array is empty, the result should be 0 since there are no subarrays to consider.
   
3. **Are there constraints on the length of the array or the values within it?**
   - Constraints are typically outlined in the problem description on LeetCode. If not specified, we can assume the array length is within conventional limits for coding challenges, e.g., up to 10^5, and the values range within typical 32-bit integers.

### Strategy
1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - `max_length`: to track the maximum length of the subarray with a positive product.
   - `pos_length`: to track the length of the current subarray with a positive product.
   - `neg_length`: to track the length of the current subarray with a negative product.

2. **Iterate Through the Array:**
   - If the current number is zero, reset both `pos_length` and `neg_length` to zero since the subarray is broken.
   - If the current number is positive:
     - Increment `pos_length` by 1 (extend the positive-length subarray).
     - If `neg_length` is not zero, increment `neg_length` by 1 (extend the negative-length subarray).
   - If the current number is negative:
     - Swap `pos_length` and `neg_length` because multiplying a negative number will invert the product's sign.
     - Increment the (new) `pos_length` by 1 if `neg_length` was not zero, otherwise reset to zero.
     - Increment the (new) `neg_length` by 1 (extend/invert).
   - Update `max_length` based on `pos_length` after each step.

3. **Time Complexity:**
   - The algorithm runs in O(n) time where n is the length of the array since we make a single pass through the array.

### Code
```python
def getMaxLen(nums):
    max_length = 0
    pos_length = 0
    neg_length = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        if num == 0:
            pos_length = 0
            neg_length = 0
        elif num > 0:
            pos_length += 1
            neg_length = neg_length + 1 if neg_length > 0 else 0
        else: # num < 0
            old_pos_length = pos_length
            pos_length = neg_length + 1 if neg_length > 0 else 0
            neg_length = old_pos_length + 1
        max_length = max(max_length, pos_length)
    
    return max_length
```

This code initializes key variables, iterates through the input array modifying subarray lengths accordingly, and tracks the maximum length of subarray with positive product during the single pass for efficient computation.
