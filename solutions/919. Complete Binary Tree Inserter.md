title:  Complete Binary Tree Inserter-out
permalink: /s919
---

Implement a data structure `CBTInserter` that can efficiently insert new nodes into a complete binary tree while maintaining its completeness. A complete binary tree is a binary tree where every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

The `CBTInserter` should support the following operations:
- `CBTInserter(TreeNode root)`: Initializes the data structure with the given root of a complete binary tree.
- `int insert(int v)`: Inserts a new node with the value `v` into the tree so that it remains complete. Returns the value of the parent of the newly inserted node.
- `TreeNode get_root()`: Returns the root node of the tree.

A binary tree node is defined as follows:
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Can `root` be `None` initially, or is it guaranteed to be a valid complete binary tree node?
   - What is the range of values for the node values?
   - How large can the tree get?

2. **Output Expectations:**
   - Should the `insert` method always operate in O(1) time, or is O(log n) acceptable?

## Strategy

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - To insert a node such that the tree remains complete, we should place the new node at the next available position from left to right.
   - Typically, a complete binary tree can be efficiently represented using a list or queue.

2. **Tree Representation:**
   - Use a list to represent the tree nodes. This list helps keep track of nodes level-wise.
   - We also use a queue to facilitate level-order traversal and to find the correct insertion point.

3. **Operations:**
   - **Initialization (`__init__` method):**
     - Perform a level-order traversal to populate the list and queue.
     - The queue ensures we can quickly find the next available parent node for insertion.
   - **Insertion (`insert` method):**
     - Insert the new node as a left/right child of the first node in the queue.
     - If a node gets a right child, remove it from the queue.
     - Always add the new node to the queue.
   - **Root Retrieval (`get_root` method):**
     - Simply return the root node.

4. **Time Complexity:**
   - **Initialization:** O(n) for building the initial queue and list from the given root.
   - **Insertion:** O(1) average time due to the constant time operations using the queue.
   - **Root Retrieval:** O(1).

## Code

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

from collections import deque

class CBTInserter:
    def __init__(self, root: TreeNode):
        self.root = root
        self.deque = deque()
        
        # Level-order traversal to populate the deque
        q = deque([root])
        while q:
            node = q.popleft()
            if node.left:
                q.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                q.append(node.right)
            # Add nodes with missing children to deque
            if not node.left or not node.right:
                self.deque.append(node)
    
    def insert(self, val: int) -> int:
        new_node = TreeNode(val)
        parent = self.deque[0]  # The parent will be at the front of the deque
        
        if not parent.left:
            parent.left = new_node
        else:
            parent.right = new_node
            self.deque.popleft()  # This parent is now complete
        
        self.deque.append(new_node)  # Add new node to the deque
        return parent.val
    
    def get_root(self) -> TreeNode:
        return self.root
```

## Time Complexity
- **Initialization (`__init__`):** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is for the complete level-order traversal to initialize the deque.
- **Insertion (`insert`):** O(1) average time complexity.
- **Root Retrieval (`get_root`):** O(1).

This solution ensures optimal performance for the given operations on a complete binary tree inserter.
