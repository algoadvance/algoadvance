title:  Minimum Number of Swaps to Make the Binary String Alternating-out
permalink: /s1864
---

Given a binary string `s`, return the minimum number of character swaps to make it alternating, or -1 if it's impossible. The string is considered alternating if no two adjacent characters are the same.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "111000"
Output: 1
Explanation: Swap positions 1 and 4: "111000" -> "101010", and the string is alternating.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "010"
Output: 0
Explanation: The string is already alternating.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "1110"
Output: -1
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the binary string be empty?
    - No, it will have at least one character according to the problem statement.
    
2. Do we need to consider any non-binary characters in the string?
    - No, the string will only consist of '0' and '1'.

## Strategy

1. Count the number of '0's and '1's in the string `s`.
2. The count difference should not be greater than 1 for the string to be possibly alternating:
    - `(abs(count_0 - count_1) > 1)` should return -1.
3. Consider two possible alternating patterns:
    1. Starting with '0': "010101..."
    2. Starting with '1': "101010..."
4. Calculate number of mismatches for both patterns:
    - For even indexed positions:
        - Pattern 1: Should be '0'
        - Pattern 2: Should be '1'
    - For odd indexed positions:
        - Pattern 1: Should be '1'
        - Pattern 2: Should be '0'
5. Determine the minimum number of swaps required to match one of the patterns.

## Code

```python
def minSwaps(s: str) -> int:
    count_0 = s.count('0')
    count_1 = len(s) - count_0
    
    # If counts differ by more than 1, return -1 as it's impossible to form alternating string
    if abs(count_0 - count_1) > 1:
        return -1
    
    def count_mismatch(s, expected_ch):
        mismatches = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] != expected_ch:
                mismatches += 1
            expected_ch = '1' if expected_ch == '0' else '0'
        return mismatches
    
    # Calculate mismatches for patterns starting with '0' and '1'
    mismatches_start_with_0 = count_mismatch(s, '0')
    mismatches_start_with_1 = count_mismatch(s, '1')
    
    # Choose the pattern with the fewest swapped mismatches
    if count_0 == count_1:
        return min(mismatches_start_with_0 // 2, mismatches_start_with_1 // 2)
    elif count_0 > count_1:
        return mismatches_start_with_0 // 2
    else:
        return mismatches_start_with_1 // 2

# Example Usage:
s = "111000"
print(minSwaps(s))  # Output: 1
```

## Time Complexity

- Counting zeros and ones in the string takes O(n) time.
- Counting mismatches for both patterns also takes O(n) time.
- Thus, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(n).

This should be efficient for reasonably large strings as it scales linearly with the size of the input.
