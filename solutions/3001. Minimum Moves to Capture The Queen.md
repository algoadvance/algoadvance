3001. Minimum Moves to Capture The Queen-out

Given an 8x8 chessboard with several pieces placed on it, determine the minimum number of moves a rook at position `(r, c)` needs to capture a queen.

The chessboard will be represented as a list of strings with each string representing a row. The pieces will be represented as follows:
- '.' : an empty square
- 'R' : the rook
- 'Q' : the queen
- 'B' : a bishop
- 'P' : a pawn

The rook can move any number of spaces horizontally or vertically but cannot jump over other pieces. The goal is to find the minimum number of moves required for the rook to capture the queen.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Will there always be exactly one rook and one queen on the board?
2. Are there any constraints on the configuration of pieces other than the rook and the queen?
3. Can the rook move through squares occupied by other pieces except pawns and bishops?

### Code
Let's implement the solution in Python.

### Strategy
1. **Identify the initial position of the Rook (R) and the Queen (Q).**
2. **Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path.**
   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this chessboard.
3. **Account for obstacles (Bishops 'B' and Pawns 'P').**
   - The rook cannot pass through these pieces.
4. **Track visited positions to avoid redundant checks.**
5. **Return the minimum number of moves once the queen is reached.**

### Time Complexity
- BFS will, in the worst case, visit each cell once.
- Hence, the time complexity is O(N*M) for an N x M board, where N = M = 8.

Let's outline the code now.

```python
from collections import deque

def min_moves_to_capture_queen(board):
    # Find positions of 'R' and 'Q'
    rook_pos = (-1, -1)
    queen_pos = (-1, -1)
    
    for r in range(8):
        for c in range(8):
            if board[r][c] == 'R':
                rook_pos = (r, c)
            elif board[r][c] == 'Q':
                queen_pos = (r, c)
    
    if rook_pos == (-1, -1) or queen_pos == (-1, -1):
        return -1  # Invalid input since should contain exactly one Rook and one Queen

    # Define directions for Up, Down, Left, Right
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    
    # BFS
    queue = deque([(rook_pos[0], rook_pos[1], 0)])  # (row, col, distance)
    visited = set()
    visited.add(rook_pos)
    
    while queue:
        r, c, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r, c
            while 0 <= nr + dr < 8 and 0 <= nc + dc < 8:
                nr, nc = nr + dr, nc + dc
                
                if board[nr][nc] == 'B' or board[nr][nc] == 'P':
                    break  # Obstacle encountered
                
                if (nr, nc) in visited:
                    continue
                
                visited.add((nr, nc))
                
                if board[nr][nc] == 'Q':
                    return dist + 1
                
                queue.append((nr, nc, dist + 1))
    
    return -1  # If we never reach the queen

# Example usage:
board = [
    ".P......",
    ".PR.....",
    "........",
    "..B.....",
    ".....Q..",
    "........",
    "........",
    "........"
]
print(min_moves_to_capture_queen(board))  # Output: expected minimum number of moves
```

### Explanation
- **Identification of positions:** Loop through the board to find the positions of the rook and the queen.
- **BFS Implementation:** 
  - Initialize the queue with the rookâ€™s starting position.
  - Use a `while` loop to process nodes in FIFO order.
  - For each position, explore in all four possible directions until you hit an obstacle, move outside the board, or encounter the queen.
  - Track visited positions to avoid redundant computations.
- If the BFS completes without finding the queen, return `-1` indicating no possible path exists.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is O(N*M) for an 8x8 board, so O(64), resulting in efficient execution for this problem size.
