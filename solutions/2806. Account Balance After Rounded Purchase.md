title:  Account Balance After Rounded Purchase-out
permalink: /s2806
---
You are given a floating-point number `amount` representing the total amount of money you have, and you are making a purchase of some item which costs a floating-point amount `purchase_cost`. After the purchase, the remaining balance should be rounded to the nearest whole number. Implement a function that returns this remaining balance after the rounded purchase.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Should the rounding be performed before or after subtracting the purchase cost from the total amount?
   **A**: The rounding should be executed after subtracting the purchase cost from the total amount.

2. **Q**: How to handle edge cases where the subtraction results in a negative value?
   **A**: We should ensure that subtraction does not result in negative balance, typically by assuming transactions that result in negative balance are not allowed.

3. **Q**: What about the precision of floating-point calculations?
   **A**: Python natively handles floating-point arithmetic with sufficient precision for this problem.

### Strategy
1. Subtract `purchase_cost` from `amount` to get the `balance`.
2. Use Pythonâ€™s built-in `round` function to round this `balance` to the nearest whole number.
3. Return the rounded balance.

### Code

```python
def remaining_balance(amount: float, purchase_cost: float) -> int:
    # Calculate the remaining balance after the purchase
    balance = amount - purchase_cost
    # Round the balance to the nearest whole number
    rounded_balance = round(balance)
    return rounded_balance
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is O(1) since the subtraction and rounding operations are constant time operations.

### Example
```python
# Example test cases

# Test case 1
amount = 100.50
purchase_cost = 25.75
print(remaining_balance(amount, purchase_cost)) # Expected output: 74

# Test case 2
amount = 50.0
purchase_cost = 19.99
print(remaining_balance(amount, purchase_cost)) # Expected output: 30

# Test case 3
amount = 10.0
purchase_cost = 10.0
print(remaining_balance(amount, purchase_cost)) # Expected output: 0
```
