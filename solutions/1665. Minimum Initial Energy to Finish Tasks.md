title:  Minimum Initial Energy to Finish Tasks-out
permalink: /s1665
---

You are given an array `tasks` where `tasks[i] = [actual_i, minimum_i]`:

- `actual_i` is the actual amount of energy you spend to finish the `i-th` task.
- `minimum_i` is the minimum amount of energy you need to start the `i-th` task.

Initially, you have zero energy. Return the minimum initial energy you need to complete all the tasks.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is there any constraint on the number of tasks?**
   - Typical constraints for such problems; let's assume `1 <= len(tasks) <= 10^5`.

2. **What are the constraints on the values of `actual_i` and `minimum_i`?**
   - Usually, such tasks have positive integers. Let's assume `1 <= actual_i, minimum_i <= 10^4`.

3. **Can the tasks be completed in any order, or must they be completed in the given order?**
   - Tasks can be completed in any order.

4. **How should we handle cases where `actual_i` is greater than `minimum_i`?**
   - The problem statement implies that `minimum_i` is always greater than or equal to `actual_i`.

## Strategy

To minimize the initial energy required, we need to prioritize the tasks in such a way that we avoid running out of energy. The crucial insight here is to consider the tasks where the difference between the `minimum_i` and `actual_i` is greatest first.

1. **Sort the tasks** based on a calculated value `(minimum_i - actual_i)`. We should sort in descending order because tasks with a higher difference will have a greater impact on the energy required.

2. **Simulate the task completion**:
   - Initialize `current_energy` to 0 and `min_initial_energy` to 0.
   - Iterate through the sorted tasks. For each task, check if `current_energy` is sufficient.
   - If not, increment `min_initial_energy` by the deficit amount so current energy equals `minimum_i`.
   - Deduct `actual_i` from `current_energy` for completing the task.

With this strategy, we ensure that for each task, we have enough initial energy to complete the most energy-intensive requirement first.

## Code

```python
def minimumEffort(tasks):
    # Sort tasks based on the difference (minimum_i - actual_i) in descending order
    tasks.sort(key=lambda x: x[1] - x[0], reverse=True)
    
    min_initial_energy = 0
    current_energy = 0
    
    for actual, minimum in tasks:
        if current_energy < minimum:
            # We need to increase our initial energy
            min_initial_energy += (minimum - current_energy)
            current_energy = minimum
        # Spend actual energy to complete the task
        current_energy -= actual
    
    return min_initial_energy

# Example usage
tasks = [[1, 3], [2, 4], [10, 11], [10, 12], [8, 9]]
print(minimumEffort(tasks))  # Output: 32
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of tasks.
- **Iteration**: Iterating through the tasks takes \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\). This should be efficient given the problem constraints.
