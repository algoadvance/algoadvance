title:  Step-By-Step Directions From a Binary Tree Node to Another-out
permalink: /s2096
---

You are given the root of a binary tree with `n` nodes. Each node is uniquely valued. You are also given the values `startValue` and `destValue` representing the value of the start and destination nodes in the tree.

Find the shortest path from the node with value `startValue` to the node with value `destValue`. The path should be represented in a string consisting only of the characters `L`, `R`, and `U`. Each character represents a move in the binary tree where:
- `'L'` means to move from a node to its left child.
- `'R'` means to move from a node to its right child.
- `'U'` means to move from a node to its parent.

Return the step-by-step directions of the shortest path from the node with value `startValue` to the node with value `destValue`.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: root = [5,1,2,3,null,6,4], startValue = 3, destValue = 6
Output: "UURL"
```

### Constraints
- The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 10^5`.
- All the values in the tree are unique.
- `startValue` and `destValue` are both in the tree.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can there be a single node tree?**
   - No, the tree has at least 2 nodes as per the given constraints.

2. **Is the tree strictly a binary search tree?**
   - No, it's a general binary tree.

3. **Are there any constraints on the depth of the tree?**
   - No constraints specified, but it might be balanced or skewed.

4. **Is it safe to assume that both `startValue` and `destValue` are valid and exist in the tree?**
   - Yes, both values are guaranteed to exist in the tree.

## Strategy

1. **Find the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)**:
   - The LCA of `startValue` and `destValue` helps in determining the split point where the paths to both nodes diverge.

2. **Find paths from LCA to `startValue` and `destValue`**:
   - Using Depth-First Search (DFS), traverse from the LCA to both `startValue` and `destValue`.
   - Record the directions during the traversal.

3. **Combine paths**:
   - From `startValue` to LCA, we need to move up (`U`).
   - From LCA to `destValue`, follow the path found.

## Code

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def findLCA(root, start, dest):
    if root is None or root.val == start or root.val == dest:
        return root
    left = findLCA(root.left, start, dest)
    right = findLCA(root.right, start, dest)
    if left and right:
        return root
    return left if left else right

def findPath(root, target, path):
    if root is None:
        return False
    if root.val == target:
        return True
    path.append('L')
    if findPath(root.left, target, path):
        return True
    path.pop()
    
    path.append('R')
    if findPath(root.right, target, path):
        return True
    path.pop()
    return False

def getDirections(root, startValue, destValue):
    # Step 1: Find LCA
    lca = findLCA(root, startValue, destValue)
    
    # Step 2: Find path from LCA to startValue and from LCA to destValue
    startPath = []
    findPath(lca, startValue, startPath)
    
    destPath = []
    findPath(lca, destValue, destPath)
    
    # Step 3: Combine paths
    # Path to startValue requires 'U' for the length of startPath
    result = ['U'] * len(startPath) + destPath
    return ''.join(result)

# Example execution:
# Let's construct the tree: [5,1,2,3,null,6,4]
# We will use the provided example
root = TreeNode(5)
root.left = TreeNode(1)
root.right = TreeNode(2)
root.left.left = TreeNode(3)
root.right.left = TreeNode(6)
root.right.right = TreeNode(4)

startValue = 3
destValue = 6
print(getDirections(root, startValue, destValue))  # Output: "UURL"
```

## Time Complexity
- **Finding LCA**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.
- **Finding Paths**: Each path finding operation is `O(n)`.
- The overall time complexity is `O(n) + O(n) + O(n) = O(n)`.
- The space complexity is also `O(n)` if we consider the maximum depth of the binary tree.
