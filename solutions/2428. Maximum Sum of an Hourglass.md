title:  Maximum Sum of an Hourglass-out
permalink: /s2428
---

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid`.

We define an hourglass as a part of the matrix with the following form:

```
a b c
  d
e f g
```

Return the maximum sum of an hourglass in the grid. If no hourglass is present, return `0`.

**Example:**
```python
Input: grid = [[6,2,1,3],[4,2,1,5],[9,2,8,7],[4,1,2,9]]
Output: 30
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints on grid dimensions?**
    - Given constraints will help determine if edge cases need to be handled.
2. **Negative values in grid?**
    - Handling of negative values within the grid is important to consider in the maximum sum calculation.
    
Assuming:
- The grid dimensions (m and n) are at least 3x3 since at least one hourglass requires 3x3 space.
- The grid values can be negative as well as positive.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Valid Hourglasses:** An hourglass pattern can only be formed if there are at least 3x3 cells. For any position `(i,j)` to be the center of an hourglass, `i` must range from `1` to `m-2` and `j` must range from `1` to `n-2`.
   
2. **Hourglass Calculation:** For each valid center `(i,j)`, compute the sum of elements in the hourglass structure:
    ```text
    grid[i-1][j-1], grid[i-1][j], grid[i-1][j+1]
                   grid[i][j]
    grid[i+1][j-1], grid[i+1][j], grid[i+1][j+1]
    ```
   
3. **Keep Track of Maximum Sum:** Throughout the process, maintain a variable to track the maximum hourglass sum encountered.

4. **Edge Cases:** 
    - If `m < 3` or `n < 3`, return `0` since no hourglass can be formed.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is `O(m * n)` because you need to check every possible center of an hourglass in the grid.

### Python Code
Here is the Python implementation of the strategy:

```python
def max_sum_hourglass(grid):
    # Check grid dimensions; return 0 if no hourglass is possible
    if len(grid) < 3 or len(grid[0]) < 3:
        return 0
    
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    
    for i in range(1, len(grid) - 1):
        for j in range(1, len(grid[0]) - 1):
            # hourglass sum centered at grid[i][j]
            current_sum = (
                grid[i-1][j-1] + grid[i-1][j] + grid[i-1][j+1] +
                              grid[i][j] +
                grid[i+1][j-1] + grid[i+1][j] + grid[i+1][j+1]
            )
            # update max_sum if the current one is larger
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    
    return max_sum

# Example usage:
grid = [[6,2,1,3],[4,2,1,5],[9,2,8,7],[4,1,2,9]]
print(max_sum_hourglass(grid))  # Output: 30
```

This function checks each possible center for an hourglass and computes the sum, updating the maximum sum found at each step. If the grid is too small to contain an hourglass, it returns `0`.
