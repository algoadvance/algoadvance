title:  Maximum Number of Words Found in Sentences-out
permalink: /s2114
---

The problem states:

> A sentence is a list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces.
> 
> You are given an array of strings `sentences`, where each `sentences[i]` represents a single sentence.
> 
> Return the maximum number of words that appear in a single sentence.
> 
> Example:
> ```python
> Input: sentences = ["alice and bob love leetcode", "i think so too", "this is great thanks very much"]
> Output: 6
> Explanation: 
> - The first sentence, "alice and bob love leetcode", has 5 words in total.
> - The second sentence, "i think so too", has 4 words in total.
> - The third sentence, "this is great thanks very much", has 6 words in total.
> Thus, the maximum number of words in a single sentence comes from the third sentence, with a total of 6 words.
> ```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: Is there a constraint on the number of sentences or the length of each sentence?
2. **Characters**: Can sentences contain only alphabetic characters and spaces, or might there be other characters?
3. **Edge Cases**: Should we handle cases with an empty list or sentences with only spaces?

If I were in a real interview, I'd ask these clarifying questions. For now, I'll assume:
- Sentences are non-empty and contain only alphabetic characters and single spaces.
- The input list `sentences` could be of any length.

## Strategy

1. **Splitting Sentences**: For each sentence, split it by spaces to get the number of words.
2. **Counting Words**: Determine the number of words in each sentence.
3. **Tracking Maximum**: Keep track of the maximum number of words found in any single sentence.
4. **Returning Result**: Return the maximum count.

## Code

Hereâ€™s how we can implement this strategy in Python:

```python
def mostWordsFound(sentences):
    max_count = 0
    for sentence in sentences:
        word_count = len(sentence.split())
        if word_count > max_count:
            max_count = word_count
    return max_count

# Example usage:
sentences = [
    "alice and bob love leetcode", 
    "i think so too", 
    "this is great thanks very much"
]
print(mostWordsFound(sentences))  # Output: 6
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of characters in the input list `sentences`. This is because:
- Splitting each sentence into words takes linear time relative to the length of that sentence.
- We iterate through each sentence to perform the split and word count operations.

Overall, the solution is efficient for large inputs and should perform well within the typical problem constraints.
