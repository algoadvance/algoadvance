title:  Find Good Days to Rob the Bank-out
permalink: /s2100
---

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `security`, and a positive integer `time`. The array represents the number of security guards present on each day.

A day `i` is considered a good day to rob the bank if:
- For the past `time` days considered inclusive (`i-time` to `i-1`), the number of security guards has been non-increasing.
- For the next `time` days considered inclusive (`i+1` to `i+time`), the number of security guards has been non-decreasing.

Return all days (`0-indexed`) that are good days to rob the bank. The returned days must be in ascending order.

### Example:
```python
Input: security = [5,3,3,3,5,6,2], time = 2
Output: [2, 3]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be the output if `time` is `0`?** 
   - Any day is a valid day for robbing the bank as there are no constraints on the past or future.

2. **What if the `security` array has fewer elements than `2 * time + 1`?**
   - In this case, it's impossible to select any day as a good day because there won't be enough past or future days, and the result should be an empty list.

## Strategy

1. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where `time` is 0 and when the length of `security` is less than `2 * time + 1`.

2. **Construct Two Helper Arrays**: 
    - `non_increasing[i]`: Track the number of consecutive days before `i` where the security does not increase.
    - `non_decreasing[i]`: Track the number of consecutive days after `i` where the security does not decrease.

3. **Determine Good Days**:
    - Iterate through each day `i` and check if it satisfies both conditions using the two helper arrays.

### Pseudocode
1. Initialize `n` as the length of the `security` array.
2. If `time == 0`, return a list of all indices from `0` to `n-1`.
3. Initialize `non_increasing` and `non_decreasing` arrays to track the number of valid days.
4. Populate the `non_increasing` array.
5. Populate the `non_decreasing` array.
6. Collect and return all valid days that satisfy both conditions.

## Code

```python
def goodDaysToRobBank(security, time):
    n = len(security)
    
    if time == 0:
        return list(range(n))
    
    if n < 2 * time + 1:
        return []

    # Create arrays to store the constraint information
    non_increasing = [0] * n
    non_decreasing = [0] * n

    # Fill non_increasing array
    for i in range(1, n):
        if security[i] <= security[i - 1]:
            non_increasing[i] = non_increasing[i - 1] + 1
    
    # Fill non_decreasing array
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if security[i] <= security[i + 1]:
            non_decreasing[i] = non_decreasing[i + 1] + 1

    # Collect good days
    good_days = []
    for i in range(time, n - time):
        if non_increasing[i] >= time and non_decreasing[i] >= time:
            good_days.append(i)
    
    return good_days

# Example usage:
# security = [5, 3, 3, 3, 5, 6, 2], time = 2
# print(goodDaysToRobBank(security, time)) # Output: [2, 3]
```

## Time Complexity

- **Filling `non_increasing` and `non_decreasing` arrays**: O(n)
- **Checking all valid days**: O(n)

Total time complexity: **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the `security` array.
