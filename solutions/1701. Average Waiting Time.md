**1701. Average Waiting Time**

You are given an array of customer objects, where `customers[i] = [arrival_i, time_i]`:

- `arrival_i` is the arrival time of the i-th customer.
- `time_i` is the time needed to prepare the food for the i-th customer.

Whenever a customer arrives, they will wait until the chef is ready to cook their food. The chef cooks the food for one customer at a time. The customer's waiting time is defined as the time they wait before the chef starts to cook their food plus the time it takes to cook their food.

Return the average waiting time of all customers. Answers within `10^-5` of the actual answer will be considered correct.

### Example 1:
```
Input: customers = [[1,2], [2,5], [4,3]]
Output: 5.0
Explanation:
1. The first customer arrives at time 1, and since no other customers are in the queue, they wait for 0 minutes and the chef starts preparing their food immediately. They finish at time 3, so the waiting time for the first customer is 3 - 1 = 2 minutes.
2. The second customer arrives at time 2. The chef has already started the food for the first customer, so the second customer has to wait until time 3 when the chef starts preparing their food. They finish at time 8, so the waiting time for the second customer is 8 - 2 = 6 minutes.
3. The third customer arrives at time 4. The chef has already started the food for the second customer, so the third customer has to wait until time 8 when the chef starts preparing their food. They finish at time 11, so the waiting time for the third customer is 11 - 4 = 7 minutes.

So the average waiting time = (2 + 6 + 7) / 3 = 5.0 minutes.

### Example 2:
```
Input: customers = [[5,2], [5,4], [10,3], [20,1]]
Output: 3.25
Explanation:
1. The first customer arrives at time 5, waits for 0 minutes, and their food is done at time 7. Their waiting time is 7 - 5 = 2 minutes.
2. The second customer arrives at time 5, waits for 2 minutes, and their food is done at time 11. Their waiting time is 11 - 5 = 6 minutes.
3. The third customer arrives at time 10, waits for 1 minute, and their food is done at time 14. Their waiting time is 14 - 10 = 4 minutes.
4. The fourth customer arrives at time 20, waits for 0 minutes, and their food is done at time 21. Their waiting time is 21 - 20 = 1 minute.

So the average waiting time = (2 + 6 + 4 + 1) / 4 = 3.25 minutes.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= customers.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= arrival_i, time_i <= 10^4`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can two customers have the same arrival time?
    - Yes.
2. If a customer arrives and the chef is free, the chef starts cooking immediately, correct?
    - Yes.
3. Customers are served in the order of their arrival times, right?
    - Yes.

## Strategy

1. We need to maintain a running time that tracks when the chef is free to start cooking for the next customer.
2. For each customer:
    - If the chef is ready before the customer arrives, update the chef's free time to the customer's arrival time.
    - Compute the waiting time for the customer as the time when the chef starts cooking minus the customer's arrival time plus the cooking time for the customer.
    - Update the total waiting time.
    - Update the free time to be the start time plus the cooking time.
3. Compute the average waiting time by dividing the total waiting time by the number of customers.

## Code

```python
def averageWaitingTime(customers):
    current_time = 0
    total_waiting_time = 0
    n = len(customers)
    
    for arrival, cooking in customers:
        # The chef will start cooking at either their current free time or the customer's arrival time
        if current_time < arrival:
            current_time = arrival

        # Calculate the waiting time for this customer
        waiting_time = current_time - arrival + cooking
        total_waiting_time += waiting_time

        # Update the current time to when the chef will be free next
        current_time += cooking

    # Return the average waiting time
    return total_waiting_time / n
```

## Time Complexity

- Time Complexity: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of customers. We iterate through the list of customers once.
- Space Complexity: `O(1)`. We are using only a few extra variables.

This method ensures that we efficiently and correctly calculate the average waiting time for all customers.
