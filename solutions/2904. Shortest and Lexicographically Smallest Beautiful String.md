title:  Shortest and Lexicographically Smallest Beautiful String-out
permalink: /s2904
---

Given a string s of length n consisting of lowercase English letters and an integer k, you need to find the lexicographically smallest beautiful string of length n. A beautiful string is a string where no two adjacent characters are the same, no two characters at positions i and (i+2) for all valid i are the same, and every character in the string is one of the first k letters.

**Constraints:**
- \( n \) only consists of lowercase letters.
- \( 1 \leq k \leq 26 \)
- \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 \)

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the exact definition of a "beautiful string"?
   - A beautiful string should not have any two adjacent characters that are the same and no two characters at positions \(i\) and \(i+2\) are the same while using only the first \(k\) lowercase letters.

2. Can we assume the input string \( s \) is always a valid string of length \( n \)?
   - Yes, since it is stated in the problem constraints.

3. Is the input string \( s \) already following any of the beautiful string conditions, or should it always be transformed?
   - The string \( s \) should be transformed to meet the beautiful string criteria.

4. Are there any specific edge cases to consider?
   - Edge cases might include the smallest values for \( n \) and \( k \), and strings that are already beautiful.

### Strategy

1. Iterate through the string and try to transform it into a lexicographically smallest beautiful string character by character.
2. Ensure that no two adjacent characters are the same.
3. Ensure that no characters at positions \(i\) and \(i+2\) are the same.
4. Use only the first \(k\) lowercase English letters.
5. If a conflict is found when placing a given character, pick the next available smallest character that satisfies the constraints.

### Code

```python
def smallest_beautiful_string(s: str, k: int) -> str:
    n = len(s)
    s = list(s)
    
    def next_char(c):
        return chr(ord(c) + 1)
    
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '?':
            # Try placing the smallest possible valid character
            for c in range(k):
                candidate = chr(ord('a') + c)
                if (i > 0 and s[i-1] == candidate) or (i > 1 and s[i-2] == candidate):
                    continue
                s[i] = candidate
                break
        else:
            # Ensure current character does not violate the beautiful string conditions
            if (i > 0 and s[i] == s[i-1]) or (i > 1 and s[i] == s[i-2]):
                for c in range(k):
                    candidate = chr(ord('a') + c)
                    if (i > 0 and s[i-1] == candidate) or (i > 1 and s[i-2] == candidate):
                        continue
                    s[i] = candidate
                    break
    
    return ''.join(s)

# Example usage:
s = "ab?ac?"
k = 3
print(smallest_beautiful_string(s, k))  # Expected output would be a valid beautiful string
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \( O(n \cdot k) \) where \( n \) is the length of the string and \( k \) is the size of the alphabet being used. In the worst case, we may end up checking \( k \) possible characters for every position in the string. However, \( k \) is constant and won't exceed 26, making the practical time complexity close to \( O(n) \).
