title:  Shuffle an Array-out
permalink: /s384
---

Given an integer array `nums`, design an algorithm to randomly shuffle the array. Implement the `Solution` class with the following methods:

1. `Solution(int[] nums)`: Initializes the object with the integer array nums.
2. `int[] reset()`: Resets the array to its original configuration and returns it.
3. `int[] shuffle()`: Returns a random shuffling of the array.

Example:

```python
Input
["Solution", "shuffle", "reset", "shuffle"]
[[[1, 2, 3]], [], [], []]
Output
[null, [3, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2]]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 2, 3]);
solution.shuffle();    // Shuffle the array randomly and return the result. Any permutation of [1, 2, 3] must be equally likely to be returned.
solution.reset();      // Resets the array to its original configuration [1, 2, 3]. Return [1, 2, 3]
solution.shuffle();    // Returns the random shuffling of array [1, 2, 3]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume the input array will contain only integers, and there are no constraints on the size of the array?
   - Yes, you can assume that the input array contains only integers and there are no constraints on the size of the array.
   
2. Is the randomness required to be uniform?
   - Yes, the shuffling should provide a uniform distribution.

3. Can we use built-in methods for shuffling the array?
   - Yes, you can use built-in methods but be prepared to explain your approach in detail and provide a manual implementation if required.

## Strategy

1. **Initialization (`__init__` method):**
    - Store the original array.
    - Create a copy for shuffling.

2. **Reset Method (`reset`):**
    - Return the original configuration of the array.

3. **Shuffle Method (`shuffle`):**
    - Use the Fisher-Yates algorithm (also known as the Knuth shuffle) for shuffling the array to ensure uniform distribution.
    - Swap each element with a randomly selected element from the rest of the array.

## Code:

```python
import random

class Solution:

    def __init__(self, nums: list[int]):
        self.original = nums[:]  # store the original array
        self.array = nums[:]     # create a mutable copy of the array

    def reset(self) -> list[int]:
        self.array = self.original[:]  # reset to original configuration
        return self.array

    def shuffle(self) -> list[int]:
        # Implementing Fisher-Yates shuffle
        for i in range(len(self.array)):
            swap_idx = random.randint(i, len(self.array) - 1)  # select a random index to swap with
            self.array[i], self.array[swap_idx] = self.array[swap_idx], self.array[i]
        return self.array
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Initialization (`__init__` method):**
    - Time complexity: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array.
    - Space complexity: O(n) for storing the original and current array.

2. **Reset Method (`reset`):**
    - Time complexity: O(n) because it needs to copy the array.
    - Space complexity: O(1) as we only mutate the existing array.

3. **Shuffle Method (`shuffle`):**
    - Time complexity: O(n) as we iterate through the array once.
    - Space complexity: O(1) as we shuffle the array in place without additional memory.

The Fisher-Yates algorithm ensures that each possible permutation of the array is equally likely, fulfilling the requirement for uniform randomness.
