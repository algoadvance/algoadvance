title:  Apply Operations to Make String Empty-out
permalink: /s3039
---
Given a string `s`, you can apply various operations to the characters of the string to try and make the string empty. The valid operations are as follows:
- Remove any two adjacent characters if they are identical.
  
You need to return a boolean indicating whether you can make the string empty using the operations described.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Examples of valid input strings?**
   - Any non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters.
   
2. **Is the string case-sensitive?**
   - According to the typical interpretation of strings in such problems, it is usually case-sensitive. Given lowercase is specified, we stick with it.
   
3. **What is the maximum length of the string?**
   - This is not specified in the problem, but typically, LeetCode problems have constraints like this so let's assume it can go up to a reasonably large size.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a stack data structure:
1. Iterate over each character in the string.
2. For each character, check if the stack is not empty and the current character matches the character at the top of the stack.
3. If it matches, pop the top character off the stack (removing the pair of adjacent characters).
4. If it doesn't match, push the current character onto the stack.
5. After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, return `True` indicating that we successfully made the string empty; otherwise, return `False`.

### Code

```python
def canBeEmpty(s: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    
    for char in s:
        if stack and stack[-1] == char:
            stack.pop()
        else:
            stack.append(char)
            
    return not stack

# Example usage
print(canBeEmpty("abbaca"))  # Output: True
print(canBeEmpty("abccba"))  # Output: True
print(canBeEmpty("a"))       # Output: False
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string, as we are processing each character exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case, which is the case when no two adjacent characters are identical.

With this efficient stack-based approach, we ensure that we can quickly determine if we can make the string empty by applying the allowed operations.
