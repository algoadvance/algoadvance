title:  First Day Where You Have Been in All the Rooms-out
permalink: /s1997
---

You are given an array `nextVisit` of length `n` where `nextVisit[i] = j` means that you will visit room `j` after visiting room `i`. Initially, you start in room 0 and you must follow the rules of the array. You want to find the first day when you have visited all the rooms.

The rule to follow is:
- Visit the first available new room.
- If all new rooms are visited, return to room 0 and repeat the process as prescribed by `nextVisit`.

You need to determine the first day (1-indexed) where you have been in all the rooms at least once. 

### Strategy

1. **Identify Day and State Transitions:**
   - Use a day counter and simulate visits to rooms based on the given transition rules.
   - Keep a set to track visited rooms and ensure to mark rooms visited as you travel.
  
2. **Traversing the Array:**
   - Begin from room 0 and follow the `nextVisit` rule.
   - If a room is revisited, force a visit to room 0 to restart the sequence based on the rules.
   - Continue this until all rooms have been visited.

### Code

```python
def first_day_visited_all_rooms(nextVisit):
    n = len(nextVisit)
    visited = set()
    visited.add(0)
    day = 0
    currentRoom = 0
    
    while len(visited) < n:
        day += 1
        nextRoom = nextVisit[currentRoom]
        if nextRoom in visited:
            currentRoom = (currentRoom + 1) % n
        else:
            visited.add(nextRoom)
            currentRoom = nextRoom

    return day + 1

# Example
nextVisit = [1,0,1]  # Example input
result = first_day_visited_all_rooms(nextVisit)
print(f"The first day where all rooms have been visited is {result}")
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The solution operates in O(n) since each room is visited at most twice (initial visit and revisit), making the operations efficient within the constraints.

**Note:** This solution ensures correct traversal and checking, following the given rules precisely to determine the earliest day when all rooms have been visited.
