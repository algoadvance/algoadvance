title:  Reachable Nodes With Restrictions-out
permalink: /s2368
---

Given an undirected tree with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array `edges` of length `n - 1` where `edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes `a_i` and `b_i`.

Additionally, you are given an integer array `restricted` which contains the nodes that are restricted.

Return the maximum number of nodes you can reach from node `0` without visiting any restricted nodes.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can I assume that the input graph is always connected?**
   - Yes, since the input is described as a tree, which is a connected acyclic graph.

2. **Do we need to consider the possibility of not reaching any nodes if node `0` is restricted?**
   - Yes, if node `0` is restricted, then we cannot reach any nodes, and the answer should be `0`.

3. **Are the node values guaranteed to be within the specified range `0` to `n-1`?**
   - Yes, all node values will be within the valid range. 

4. **What is the expected output if the starting node (`node 0`) is not restricted but is connected only to restricted nodes?**
   - The output should be `1` because we can still visit node `0` itself.

## Strategy

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the tree using an adjacency list.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS)**: To traverse the tree starting from node `0` and count the number of reachable nodes while avoiding the restricted nodes.
3. **Handling Restrictions**: Use a set for restricted nodes for O(1) lookup time.
4. **Visited Set**: Keep track of visited nodes to avoid revisiting and getting stuck in cycles.

## Code

Here is the Python solution using Depth-First Search (DFS):

```python
def reachableNodes(n, edges, restricted):
    from collections import defaultdict

    # Represent the tree using adjacency list
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        tree[v].append(u)
    
    # Convert restricted list to a set for O(1) look-up
    restricted_set = set(restricted)
    
    # Initialize visited set
    visited = set()
    
    def dfs(node):
        if node in restricted_set or node in visited:
            return 0
        visited.add(node)
        count = 1
        for neighbor in tree[node]:
            count += dfs(neighbor)
        return count
    
    # Start DFS from node 0
    return dfs(0)

# Example Usage:
# n = 7
# edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]]
# restricted = [4, 5]
# print(reachableNodes(n, edges, restricted)) # Output: 4
```

## Time Complexity

- **Building the Tree**: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes since we process each edge once.
- **DFS Traversal**: `O(n)` in the worst case because in a tree with `n` nodes, we visit each node exactly once.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.

This solution efficiently counts the maximum number of reachable nodes in the tree while respecting the restrictions.
