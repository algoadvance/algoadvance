You are given two strings, `s` and `t`. You need to transform string `s` into string `t` using the following operation:

1. Choose any character of `s` and change it to any other lowercase English character.

You must accomplish the transformation using the **minimum number of operations**. Return the minimum number of operations needed to transform `s` into `t`. If the transformation is not possible (e.g., if `s` and `t` have different lengths), return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are `s` and `t` guaranteed to be the same length?**: If not, we need to handle the case where their lengths differ up front.
2. **What is the character set for `s` and `t`?**: Assuming both are lowercase English letters.
3. **What should we return when `s` is already equal to `t`?**: The minimum operations should be 0.
4. **Are the strings always non-empty?**: This is important for edge cases.

Assuming the lengths of `s` and `t` are always equal and both consist of lowercase English letters.

### Strategy

1. **Check Lengths**: First, ensure the lengths of `s` and `t` are the same. If not, return `-1`.
2. **Count Differences**: Compare corresponding characters of `s` and `t`. Count the number of positions where the characters differ.
3. **Return Count**: The count of differing positions is the minimum number of operations needed.

### Code

Hereâ€™s how we can implement the solution in Python:

```python
def min_operations(s: str, t: str) -> int:
    # First, check if the lengths are different
    if len(s) != len(t):
        return -1
    
    # Initialize a counter for minimum operations
    min_ops = 0
    
    # Iterate over characters of both strings and count differences
    for i in range(len(s)):
        if s[i] != t[i]:
            min_ops += 1
    
    return min_ops

# Example usage:
s = "abcdef"
t = "bbcdef"
print(min_operations(s, t))  # Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the strings. This is because we make a single pass through both strings to count the differences. The space complexity is **O(1)** as we are only using a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is **O(1)** as we only use a fixed amount of additional space for the `min_ops` counter. This is independent of the input size.
