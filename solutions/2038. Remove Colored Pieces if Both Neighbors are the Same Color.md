title:  Remove Colored Pieces if Both Neighbors are the Same Color-out
permalink: /s2038
---

You are given a string `colors` where each character is either 'A' or 'B'. In a single step, you can remove a colored piece if its both neighbors are the same color. 

- Alice and Bob are playing alternatively, with Alice starting first. 
- Alice can only remove 'A' pieces, and Bob can only remove 'B' pieces.
- The player who cannot make a move in their turn loses, and the other player wins.

Return `true` if Alice wins and `false` if Bob wins.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are there any constraints on the length of the string?**
   - The length of the `colors` string will be at least `1` and at most `10^5`.
2. **Can the moves affect each other or overlap?**
   - Yes, removing a piece changes the neighbors of other pieces.

### Strategy
1. **Count Potential Moves**:
   - Iterate through the string and count how many removable 'A's and 'B's are available.
   - A removal operation is possible if a character has the same character on both its left and right ('AAA' or 'BBB').
  
2. **Determine Winner**:
   - Since Alice and Bob take turns, the number of possible moves for each player will determine the winner.
   - Alice will win if she has more possible moves because she starts first.

### Code

```python
def winnerOfGame(colors: str) -> bool:
    count_A = 0
    count_B = 0
    n = len(colors)
    
    for i in range(1, n-1):
        if colors[i-1] == colors[i] == colors[i+1]:
            if colors[i] == 'A':
                count_A += 1
            elif colors[i] == 'B':
                count_B += 1
                
    return count_A > count_B
```

### Time Complexity
- **O(n)**: We iterate over the string once to count the removable pieces.
- **O(1)**: Space complexity is constant because we only use a fixed amount of extra space for counters.

Overall, the solution is efficient and well within acceptable limits for the problem constraints.
