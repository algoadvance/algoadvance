title:  Merge k Sorted Lists-out
permalink: /s23
---

You are given an array of `k` linked-lists `lists`, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order. Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

### Example:
```python
Input: lists = [[1,4,5],[1,3,4],[2,6]]
Output: [1,1,2,3,4,4,5,6]

Input: lists = []
Output: []

Input: lists = [[]]
Output: []
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the values within the linked lists?**
   - The linked list elements can have arbitrary integer values including negative numbers.
2. **Do the linked lists have to be merged in place, or can we utilize additional space?**
   - We can utilize additional space if needed.
3. **Can the input linked lists be empty?**
   - Yes, some of the linked lists can be empty or the input itself can be an empty list.

## Code

To solve this problem efficiently, we can leverage a min-heap (or priority queue) to always extract the smallest element from the k linked lists.

Here is the code:

```python
from typing import List, Optional
import heapq

# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

    def __lt__(self, other):  # This will help the heap to compare ListNode objects.
        return self.val < other.val

def mergeKLists(lists: List[Optional[ListNode]]) -> Optional[ListNode]:
    min_heap = []

    # Initialize the heap with the head nodes of each linked list
    for linked_list in lists:
        if linked_list:
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, linked_list)
    
    # Dummy node to help easily return the merged list
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    current = dummy

    while min_heap:
        # Get the smallest node
        smallest_node = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        current.next = smallest_node
        current = current.next
        
        # If there is a next node, push it to the heap
        if smallest_node.next:
            heapq.heappush(min_heap, smallest_node.next)

    return dummy.next
```

## Strategy

1. **Heap Initialization**: Push the head nodes of all the non-empty linked lists into the min-heap.
2. **Merging Process**:
    - Continuously extract the smallest node from the heap.
    - Attach this node to the merged linked list.
    - If this node has a next node, push the next node into the heap.
3. **Completion**: Keep iterating until the heap becomes empty. The `dummy` node helps in easily returning the head of the merged list.

## Time Complexity

- **Heap Initialization**: \(O(k \log k)\) where \(k\) is the number of linked lists.
- **Merging Process**: Each node is pushed and popped from the heap exactly once, resulting in \(O(N \log k)\) complexity, where \(N\) is the total number of nodes. 

Combining these, the overall time complexity is \(O(N \log k)\), which is efficient for handling large numbers of sorted linked lists.
