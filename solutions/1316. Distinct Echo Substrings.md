title:  Distinct Echo Substrings-out
permalink: /s1316
---

You are given a string `text`. A substring of `text` is called an "echo substring" if it can be written as the concatenation of some string with itself (e.g., the string "abcabc" can be written as "abc" + "abc", thus "abcabc" is an echo substring). Return the number of distinct non-empty echo substrings of `text`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length constraint of the text?**
   - The text's length is between 1 and 10,000.

2. **What are the allowed characters in the text?**
   - The text consists of lowercase English letters only.

3. **What is the expected output?**
   - The output should be an integer representing the number of distinct non-empty echo substrings.

### Strategy

To solve the problem efficiently, we need to recognize and count distinct echo substrings. Here is the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Iterate Over Possible Substring Lengths:**
   - Consider substrings of even length (as only even-length substrings can be split evenly into two equal parts).

2. **Check All Substrings:**
   - For each starting position, generate substrings of the given even length and check if they are echo substrings (i.e., first half equals the second half).

3. **Use a Set for Distinct Values:**
   - Use a `set` to store unique echo substrings. This ensures that each distinct echo substring is only counted once.

4. **Sliding Window Technique:**
   - Use a sliding window to efficiently traverse through potential substrings.

### Code

Here's how you can implement the solution:

```python
def distinctEchoSubstrings(text: str) -> int:
    n = len(text)
    echo_substrings = set()
    
    # Check all substrings of even length
    for length in range(2, n + 1, 2):  # length must be even
        for i in range(0, n - length + 1):
            half = length // 2
            if text[i:i + half] == text[i + half:i + length]:
                echo_substrings.add(text[i:i + length])
             
    return len(echo_substrings)
```

### Time Complexity

- **Outer Loop (Length):** The loop runs for half of the possible lengths (`O(n/2)`).
- **Inner Loop (Starting Position):** For each length, it runs from `0` to `n-length` (`O(n - length)`).
  
Overall, in the worst case scenario, the number of operations can be approximated by `O(n^2)`, which should be efficient enough given the constraints.

Thus, this algorithm runs in approximately `O(n^2)` time complexity, which is suitable for the input size constraint up to 10,000 characters.
