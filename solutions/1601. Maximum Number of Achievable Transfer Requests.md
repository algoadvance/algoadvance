title:  Maximum Number of Achievable Transfer Requests-out
permalink: /s1601
---

We have `n` buildings numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. Each building has a certain number of requests to transfer people from one building to another. Each request is represented as an array of two integers, `from[i]` and `to[i]`, where `from[i]` denotes the building the request originated from, and `to[i]` denotes the destination building. 

We need to fulfill the maximum number of requests such that for every building, the number of people entering the building equals the number of people leaving it (i.e., the net change in population for every building is zero).

### Input:
- `n`: An integer, the number of buildings.
- `requests`: A list where each element is a list of two integers representing the `from` and `to` buildings for each request.

### Output:
- Return the maximum number of achievable requests.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 20`
- `1 <= requests.length <= 16`
- `requests[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= requests[i][0], requests[i][1] < n`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can multiple requests originate from the same building and/or be directed to the same building?
2. Do we need to prioritize certain requests over others, or do they all have equal weight?
3. Is each request independent, or can fulfilling one request influence the feasibility of fulfilling another?

Given all requests have equal weight and the feasibility is determined by the net-zero population change constraint, we can proceed with a combinatorial approach.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a combinatorial approach exploring all subsets of requests to find which subset can be fulfilled while meeting the net-zero population change constraint. 

1. **Subset Enumeration**: We need to consider all possible subsets of requests.
2. **Balance Check**: For each subset, check if they result in a balanced transfer for every building.
3. **Maximize Requests**: Track the maximum number of requests that can be fulfilled with a balanced transfer.

We'll use a recursive or iterative approach with bitmasks to represent subsets.

## Code

```python
def maximumRequests(n, requests):
    def is_valid(subset):
        delta = [0] * n
        for i in range(len(requests)):
            if subset & (1 << i):
                from_bldg, to_bldg = requests[i]
                delta[from_bldg] -= 1
                delta[to_bldg] += 1
        return all(x == 0 for x in delta)

    max_requests = 0

    for subset in range(1 << len(requests)):
        if is_valid(subset):
            max_requests = max(max_requests, bin(subset).count('1'))

    return max_requests

# Example usage:
print(maximumRequests(5, [[0,1],[1,0],[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[3,4]]))  # Output should be 5
```

## Time Complexity

- The number of subsets of requests is \(2^{\text{len(requests)}}\).
- For each subset, we compute the net changes for every building, which takes \(O(\text{len(requests)})\) time.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(2^{\text{len(requests)}} \cdot \text{len(requests)})\).

Given that \(\text{len(requests)} \leq 16\), this approach is feasible within the constraints.
