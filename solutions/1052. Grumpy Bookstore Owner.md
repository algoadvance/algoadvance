title:  Grumpy Bookstore Owner-out
permalink: /s1052
---
You are given two integer arrays, `customers` and `grumpy`, and an integer `X`. The `customers` array represents the number of customers in the bookstore on each day, and the `grumpy` array indicates whether the bookstore owner was grumpy on that particular day (`1` for grumpy, `0` for not grumpy). When the owner is grumpy, they lose all customers for that day. However, the owner can use a special technique to stop being grumpy for `X` consecutive days, which will result in keeping all customers for those days.

The task is to find the maximum number of customers who can be satisfied over the given period if the owner uses this technique optimally.

### Input
- `customers`: a list of integers representing the number of customers each day.
- `grumpy`: a list of integers where `1` indicates the owner is grumpy and `0` indicates the owner is not grumpy.
- `X`: an integer representing the number of days the owner can use the technique to not be grumpy.

### Output
- An integer representing the maximum number of satisfied customers the owner can ensure.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What are the constraints on the lengths of the `customers` and `grumpy` lists?
   - Both lists have the same length, which can range from `1` to `20000`.
2. Are all elements in `customers` and `grumpy` non-negative integers?
   - Yes, the elements in `customers` are non-negative integers, and the elements in `grumpy` are either `0` or `1`.

### Strategy
1. **Base Calculation**: Without using the special technique, calculate the number of satisfied customers where the owner is not grumpy.
2. **Sliding Window Approach**: Use the sliding window technique to find the optimal window of `X` days where the owner stops being grumpy. Calculate the additional customers that could be retained during this period.
3. **Combine Results**: Sum the base satisfied customers and the maximum additional customers obtained from the sliding window to get the final result.

### Code
Here's how you can implement the solution in Python:

```python
def maxSatisfied(customers, grumpy, X):
    # Base satisfaction calculation where owner is not grumpy
    total_satisfied = sum(customers[i] for i in range(len(customers)) if grumpy[i] == 0)
    
    # Calculate extra satisfaction we could get by making the grumpy owner not grumpy for X days
    extra_satisfied = 0
    max_extra_satisfied = 0
    
    # Initial window of size X
    for i in range(X):
        if grumpy[i] == 1:
            extra_satisfied += customers[i]
    max_extra_satisfied = extra_satisfied
    
    # Sliding window from day X to the end
    for i in range(X, len(customers)):
        if grumpy[i] == 1:
            extra_satisfied += customers[i]
        if grumpy[i - X] == 1:
            extra_satisfied -= customers[i - X]
        max_extra_satisfied = max(max_extra_satisfied, extra_satisfied)
    
    return total_satisfied + max_extra_satisfied

# Example usage:
customers = [1, 0, 1, 2, 1, 1, 7, 5]
grumpy = [0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1]
X = 3
print(maxSatisfied(customers, grumpy, X))  # Output: 16
```

### Time Complexity
- The solution involves one pass to calculate the base satisfied customers and another pass using a sliding window, each with a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the input lists. Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n). This is efficient given the constraints.
