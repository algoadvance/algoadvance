title:  Minimum Non-Zero Product of the Array Elements-out
permalink: /s1969
---

Given a positive integer \( p \), you need to find the minimum non-zero product of the elements of an array consisting of all integers from \( 1 \) to \( 2^p - 1 \). Since the product can be very large, return it modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the array implicitly defined by the integer \( p \)?**
   - Yes, the array is defined by the integers from \( 1 \) to \( 2^p - 1 \).

2. **What is the maximum value of \( p \) that we need to handle?**
   - \( p \) can be as large as \( 60 \), according to the problem constraints.

3. **What is the result we need to output?**
   - The minimum non-zero product modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

4. **Are all integers in the array distinct?**
   - Yes, the array consists of distinct integers from \( 1 \) to \( 2^p - 1 \).

### Strategy

1. **Understand the problem constraints and implications:**
   - For a given \( p \), the array is \( [1, 2, \ldots, 2^p - 1] \).
   - The maximum value is \( 2^p - 1 \).
   - The product needs to be minimized modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

2. **Observations:**
   - Multiplying all elements directly results in an extraordinarily large product.
   - Mathematically, values close to maximum and minimum need to be chosen to minimize the overall product.
   - We will try to avoid creating overly large values by avoiding large multiplicands unnecessarily.

3. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - A useful observation is setting up pairs formed by elements close to each other in value, which balance each other out in a way that minimizes the overall product.
   - For \( p \), we get \( 2^p - 1 \) numbers. Excluding the highest value can still make the product minimal, distributing the multiplicative burden over remaining elements.

4. **Approach:**
   - Focus on a core pattern: essentially repeatedly dividing the problem to manageable chunks.
   - Pairing strategically while leveraging modular arithmetic to keep intermediate results within limits.

### Code

We'll code this using Python with modular arithmetic to manage the large numbers:

```python
def minNonZeroProduct(p: int) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    def modular_exponentiation(base, exp, mod):
        result = 1
        while exp > 0:
            if exp % 2 == 1:
                result = (result * base) % mod
            base = (base * base) % mod
            exp = exp // 2
        return result
    
    max_val = (1 << p) - 1
    result = (max_val % MOD) * modular_exponentiation(max_val - 1, (1 << (p - 1)) - 1, MOD)
    
    return result % MOD

# Example usage
p = 3
print(minNonZeroProduct(p))  # Output should be the minimum non-zero product modulo 10^9 + 7
```

### Time Complexity

- **Modular Exponentiation:** \( O(\log n) \) where \( n \) is the exponent.
- Overall, the time complexity will be \( O(\log(2^p - 1)) \), effectively \( O(p) \), which is efficient and handles the problem constraints well.

This solution effectively minimizes the product of the elements in the array while ensuring that we stay within the constraints of large number operations through modular arithmetic.
