title:  Find the Maximum Number of Marked Indices-out
permalink: /s2576
---
You are given an array of integers `nums`. You are asked to find the maximum number of marked indices in `nums`. An index `i` is marked if for every index `j` (where `i < j`), `2 * nums[i] > nums[j]`.

### Clarifying Questions
To ensure I understand the problem correctly, let me ask a few clarifying questions:
1. Is the array sorted or unsorted?
2. Are there any constraints on the size of the array (e.g., maximum length)?
3. What should be returned if the array is empty?
4. Are there negative numbers in the array?

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to identify indices that satisfy the given condition effectively. Here is a strategy to consider:

1. **Sort the Array**: First, sort the array to make the problem easier to handle.
2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: Use two pointers to identify pairs of indices that satisfy the `2 * nums[i] > nums[j]` condition.
3. **Iterate**: Iterate through the array and for each element, try to find its pair starting from the next element onward.

### Code

```python
def maxMarkedIndices(nums):
    # Sort the nums array
    nums.sort()
    
    n = len(nums)
    count = 0
    left, right = 0, 1
    
    while left < n and right < n:
        if 2 * nums[left] > nums[right]:
            count += 2  # Both indices are marked
            left += 1
        right += 1
    
    return count

# Example usage:
nums = [3, 5, 7, 9, 10]
print(maxMarkedIndices(nums))  # Expected output: 4
```

### Strategy Explanation
1. **Sort the Array**:
   - Sorting helps to easily find pairs such that `2 * nums[i] > nums[j]` efficiently.
   
2. **Use Two Pointers**:
   - Initiate two pointers, `left` starting at index 0 and `right` starting at index 1.
   - Iterate through the array, trying to find pairs by checking the condition `2 * nums[left] > nums[right]`.
   - If satisfied, count both indices and move both pointers forward, otherwise move the `right` pointer only.

### Time Complexity
- Sorting the array takes `O(n log n)`.
- The two-pointer pass through the array takes `O(n)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`, which should be efficient for most practical use cases.
