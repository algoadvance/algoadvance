title:  Minimum Jumps to Reach Home-out
permalink: /s1654
---

We are given the following parameters:
- `forbidden`: a list of integers representing forbidden positions.
- `a`: an integer representing the forward jump length.
- `b`: an integer representing the backward jump length.
- `x`: the target position we want to reach.

The task is to determine the minimum number of jumps needed to reach position `x` starting from position `0`, provided that we start moving forward. We can jump forward by `a` units or jump backward by `b` units, but we cannot land on any forbidden positions. We cannot jump backward immediately after a backward jump.

If it isn't possible to reach the position `x`, we should return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions

- **Can the target position `x` be equal to 0?** No, the starting position is `0` and we need to jump at least once.
- **Is there a maximum constraint on the `a`, `b`, or values in `forbidden` list?** The constraints would be typical for these types of problems (presumed to not exceed the usual competitive programming limits unless specified).
- **Should we consider wrapping around?** No, position always should be non-negative and within the range of given problem constraints.

## Strategy

We can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach because it helps in finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. The graph here is represented by positions.

1. **Initialize a queue** to hold positions and the number of jumps taken to reach them (also maintain a flag to indicate if we arrived by a backward jump).
2. **Visited Data Structure**: Use a set to remember visited positions.
3. **Start BFS from position `0`**: 
    - For every position, consider two possible moves:
      - Jump forward to `current + a` (if falling within bounds and not forbidden)
      - Jump backward to `current - b` (if falling within bounds, not forbidden, and last move wasn't a backward jump)
4. Return the number of jumps as soon as we reach position `x`.
5. If BFS completes without finding `x`, return `-1`.

## Code

Here's the Python implementation of the above strategy:

```python
from collections import deque

def minimumJumps(forbidden, a, b, x):
    forbidden = set(forbidden)
    max_position = max(max(forbidden), x) + a + b  # No need to go further than farthest needed position
    visited = set()
    
    queue = deque([(0, 0, False)]) # (current_position, jumps_count, came_from_backward)
    visited.add((0, False))
    
    while queue:
        position, jumps, came_from_backward = queue.popleft()
        
        # Check if we have reached the target position
        if position == x:
            return jumps
            
        # Move forward
        forward = position + a
        if forward <= max_position and forward not in forbidden and (forward, False) not in visited:
            queue.append((forward, jumps + 1, False))
            visited.add((forward, False))
        
        # Move backward
        backward = position - b
        if backward >= 0 and not came_from_backward and backward not in forbidden and (backward, True) not in visited:
            queue.append((backward, jumps + 1, True))
            visited.add((backward, True))
    
    return -1
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity can be approximated as \(O(A \times B)\), where \(A\) and \(B\) are the lengths of forward and backward jumps respectively. This approximation results because the BFS explores each possible position and combination of jumps up to the farthest possible position `max(forbidden) + a + b`.

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of possible unique states stored in the visit set and queue, but it is bounded by the maximum position we calculate.

This solution ensures we explore all relevant positions efficiently to determine the minimal number of jumps required to reach `x`.
