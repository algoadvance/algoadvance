title:  Maximum XOR After Operations -out
permalink: /s2317
---

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. In one operation, select any non-negative integer `x` and an index `i`, then update `nums[i]` to be equal to `nums[i] OR x`.

Return the maximum possible bitwise XOR of all elements of `nums` after applying at most `n` operations where `n` is the length of `nums`.

Example:
```
Input: nums = [3, 2, 4, 6]
Output: 7
Explanation: Apply the operation x = 1 on the last element and nums = [3, 2, 4, 7]. Then, the XOR is 3 ^ 2 ^ 4 ^ 7 = 7.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `x` be 0?**
   - Yes, `x` can be any non-negative integer.

2. **Can we apply multiple operations to the same index?**
   - Yes, up to `n` operations can be performed, potentially all on the same index.

3. **Is there a constraint on the size of `nums`?**
   - Yes, usually a constraint such as `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5` and `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9` will be provided.

4. **What should we do if `nums` is already the optimal result?**
   - We still need to determine if that is the case and confirm our result.

### Strategy

The key to solving this problem is understanding the properties of the XOR operation:
- XOR is maximized when the result has the most number of '1' bits.

To achieve the maximum possible XOR:
1. Analyze the bit positions of all numbers in the array.
2. If a position bit is 0 in all numbers, it should be converted to 1 to maximize the XOR in the result, by choosing appropriate values of `x`.

Given that the largest possible `x` that affects the i-th bit is `2^i`, the strategy revolves around manipulating bits to achieve the highest value XOR.

### Code

```python
def maximumXOR(nums):
    max_xor = 0
    for num in nums:
        max_xor |= num
    return max_xor

# Example Usage
nums = [3, 2, 4, 6]
print(maximumXOR(nums))  # Output: 7
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: Start with a variable `max_xor` which stores the highest XOR value we can achieve.
2. **Bitwise OR Operation**: Iterate through each number in `nums`, updating `max_xor` with the bitwise OR between `max_xor` and the number. The OR operation ensures that any bit that is 1 in any number in `nums` gets set to 1 in `max_xor`.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the input list `nums`. This is because we are iterating through the list once and performing a constant-time bitwise OR operation for each element.

The space complexity is O(1), as we are not using any additional data structures that scale with the input size.
