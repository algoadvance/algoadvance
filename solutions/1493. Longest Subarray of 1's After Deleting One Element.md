title:  Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element-out
permalink: /s1493
---
Given a binary array `nums`, you should delete one element from it.

Return the size of the longest non-empty subarray containing only `1`s in the resulting array.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: After deleting the element at index 2, the array is [1, 1, 1], which has length 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 5
Explanation: After deleting the element at index 4, the array is [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1], which has length 5.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: After deleting any element from [1, 1, 1], the array is [1, 1], which has length 2.
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Should we assume that there is always at least one `1` in the array?
2. Is it guaranteed that the array will have at least one `0` to be removed?
3. Can we use extra space for our solution?

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use the sliding window technique. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Use two pointers (left and right) to represent the window.
2. Traverse through the array using the right pointer.
3. Keep count of zero encountered in the current window.
4. If the count of zeros is more than one (because we can delete at most one zero), increment the left pointer to reduce the window size until the count of zeros is exactly one.
5. Track the maximum length of the window whenever the count of zeros is either zero or one.
6. Return the maximum length window size minus one, since we have to delete one zero.

## Code
```python
def longestSubarray(nums):
    left = 0
    num_zeros = 0
    max_length = 0

    for right in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[right] == 0:
            num_zeros += 1

        while num_zeros > 1:
            if nums[left] == 0:
                num_zeros -= 1
            left += 1
            
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)

    return max_length - 1

# Example usage:
nums1 = [1, 1, 0, 1]
print(longestSubarray(nums1))  # Output: 3

nums2 = [0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1]
print(longestSubarray(nums2))  # Output: 5

nums3 = [1, 1, 1]
print(longestSubarray(nums3))  # Output: 2
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity is \(O(n)\), where `n` is the length of the input array. This is because each element is processed at most twice (once by the right pointer and once by the left pointer).

The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since we are using only a few extra variables.
