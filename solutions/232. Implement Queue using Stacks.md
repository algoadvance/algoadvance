title:  Implement Queue using Stacks-out
permalink: /s232
---

Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (`push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `empty`).

Implement the `MyQueue` class:

- `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
- `int pop()` Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
- `int peek()` Returns the element at the front of the queue.
- `boolean empty()` Returns whether the queue is empty.

**Notes:**
- You must use only standard operations of a stack, which means only `push to top`, `peek/pop from top`, `size`, and `is empty` operations are valid.
- Depending on your language, the stack may not be supported natively. You may simulate a stack using a list or deque (double-ended queue) as long as you use only standard stack operations.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the input size constrained?**
   - Not necessarily. The main concern is ensuring the operations adhere strictly to the stack operations.

2. **Can we assume the inputs are valid?**
   - Yes, assume that inputs given to each method are valid and within expected ranges.

3. **Should the solution be optimized for any specific operation?**
   - The operations are evenly distributed; thus, our implementation should aim for overall efficiency in both `push` and `pop` operations.

## Strategy

We'll use two stacks to simulate the queue:
1. **Stack1 (in_stack)**: Used for enqueue operations.
2. **Stack2 (out_stack)**: Used for dequeue operations.

**Operations:**

- **Push**:
  - Directly push elements onto `in_stack`.
  
- **Pop and Peek**:
  - If `out_stack` is empty, pop all elements from `in_stack` and push them onto `out_stack` (this reverses the order, simulating FIFO).
  - Pop/Peek elements from `out_stack`.

- **Empty**:
  - Return `True` if both `in_stack` and `out_stack` are empty.

This approach ensures that we always get the front element in `O(1)` average time, while pushes are `O(1)` and pops are amortized `O(1)` due to potential transfer between stacks.

## Code

```python
class MyQueue:

    def __init__(self):
        self.in_stack = []
        self.out_stack = []

    def push(self, x: int) -> None:
        self.in_stack.append(x)

    def pop(self) -> int:
        self._transfer()
        return self.out_stack.pop()

    def peek(self) -> int:
        self._transfer()
        return self.out_stack[-1]

    def empty(self) -> bool:
        return not self.in_stack and not self.out_stack
    
    def _transfer(self) -> None:
        if not self.out_stack:
            while self.in_stack:
                self.out_stack.append(self.in_stack.pop())
```

## Time Complexity

- **Push**: O(1) — Each push operation directly puts the element onto the `in_stack`.
- **Pop**: Amortized O(1) — While `out_stack` is empty, elements are transferred from `in_stack` in O(n) time, but each individual element is popped only once.
- **Peek**: Amortized O(1) — Similar to `pop`, but no elements are removed.
- **Empty**: O(1) — Just checks if both stacks are empty.

This implementation efficiently simulates a queue using two stacks, ensuring all operations adhere to the required time complexities.
