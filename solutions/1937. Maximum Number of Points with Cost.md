title:  Maximum Number of Points with Cost-out
permalink: /s1937
---

This task seems to refer to LeetCode problem 1937: "Maximum Number of Points with Cost." The problem statement is as follows:

You are given an `m x n` matrix `points`, where `points[i][j]` represents the points you can collect from the cell `(i, j)`.

You can move to the next row directly below the current row, but moving to the next row has a cost. If you move from `points[i][j]` to `points[i+1][j']`, you lose `|j - j'|` points, where `|j - j'|` is the absolute difference between the column indices you moved to and from.

Your task is to return the maximum number of points you can achieve.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size Constraints:**
   * What are the constraints on the matrix dimensions (`m` and `n`)?
   
   Constraints typically can help decide the best approach.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   * Are there any specific edge cases (e.g., single row or single column)?

## Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Strategy:**
   * We can utilize a dynamic programming approach (`dp`) where `dp[i][j]` stores the maximum points collected up to row `i` and column `j`.
   
2. **Initial State:**
   * Initialize `dp[0][j]` to `points[0][j]` for all `j`.

3. **Transitions:**
   * For each subsequent row, we will update `dp[i][j]` considering the possible transitions from the previous row `i-1`.
   * In order to efficiently calculate the maximum value of `dp[i-1][j'] - |j' - j|`, we can use two passes:
     * Left-to-right pass to accumulate maximum values when transitioning from left to right.
     * Right-to-left pass to accumulate maximum values when transitioning from right to left.

4. **Result Extraction:**
   * The result will be the maximum value among `dp[m-1][j]`.

## Code

```python
def maxPoints(points):
    m, n = len(points), len(points[0])
    # Initialize dp with the first row
    dp = points[0][:]

    for i in range(1, m):
        # We use two temporary arrays to assist in calculating the max.
        
        # For the left-to-right traversal
        left_max = [0] * n
        left_max[0] = dp[0]
        for j in range(1, n):
            left_max[j] = max(left_max[j-1] - 1, dp[j])

        # For the right-to-left traversal
        right_max = [0] * n
        right_max[n-1] = dp[n-1]
        for j in range(n-2, -1, -1):
            right_max[j] = max(right_max[j+1] - 1, dp[j])
        
        # Update dp for the current row
        dp_new = [0] * n
        for j in range(n):
            dp_new[j] = points[i][j] + max(left_max[j], right_max[j])
        
        dp = dp_new  # Move to the next row

    return max(dp)

# Example usage
points = [[1,2,3],[1,5,1],[3,1,1]]
print(maxPoints(points))  # Output: 9
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(m \cdot n)\) because:
1. We process each row exactly once.
2. For each row, we perform two additional passes over all columns (left-to-right and right-to-left).

Thus, the overall time complexity is linear with respect to the size of the input matrix, efficiently solving the problem within the given constraints.
