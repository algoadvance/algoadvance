title:  Maximum Path Quality of a Graph-out
permalink: /s2065
---

You are given an undirected graph with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array `values` where `values[i]` is the value of the `i-th` node. You are also given a 2D array `edges`, where `edges[j] = [uj, vj, timej]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between the nodes `uj` and `vj` in the graph, which takes `timej` seconds to traverse.

You can traverse the graph starting from node `0` and moving to different nodes, but you cannot spend more than `maxTime` seconds in total. The path you take does not have to be simple; you can visit the same node multiple times. The quality of a path is the sum of the values of the unique nodes visited in the path.

Return the maximum quality of a path that you can achieve.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can nodes be revisited?**
   - Yes, nodes can be revisited.
2. **Does the traversal have to end at node 0?**
   - No, the traversal does not have to end at node 0.
3. **Can there be multiple edges between the same pair of nodes?**
   - The problem does not specify, but assume a simple graph where at most one edge exists between any pair of nodes.

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation:** Use an adjacency list to represent the graph.
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Use DFS to explore all possible paths starting from node 0.
3. **Tracking Visited Nodes:** Use a set to keep track of the unique visited nodes.
4. **Backtracking:** Once a path is fully explored, backtrack and try another path.
5. **Path Quality Calculation:** For each unique node visited in a path, sum up their values and update the maximum quality if it's larger than the previously recorded maximum.

### Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def maximumPathQuality(self, values, edges, maxTime):
        # Build the graph
        graph = defaultdict(list)
        for u, v, time in edges:
            graph[u].append((v, time))
            graph[v].append((u, time))
        
        # Initialize variables
        n = len(values)
        max_quality = 0
        
        def dfs(node, current_time, path_value, visited):
            nonlocal max_quality

            # If we exceed maxTime, terminate this path
            if current_time > maxTime:
                return

            # Update path quality
            if node not in visited:
                path_value += values[node]
                visited.add(node)
            
            # Update max quality
            max_quality = max(max_quality, path_value)
            
            # Explore all neighbors
            for neighbor, travel_time in graph[node]:
                dfs(neighbor, current_time + travel_time, path_value, visited.copy())
            
            # Backtrack if not revisiting already visited nodes
            visited.remove(node)
        
        # Start DFS from node 0
        dfs(0, 0, 0, set([0]))
        
        return max_quality

# Example usage:
# values = [0, 32, 10, 43]
# edges = [[0,1,10],[1,2,15],[0,3,10]]
# maxTime = 25
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.maximumPathQuality(values, edges, maxTime)) # Output: 75
```

### Time Complexity

The primary operations involve traversing the graph and exploring all possible paths, which leads to the following time complexity considerations:
- **DFS Traversal:** In the worst case, the DFS traversal explores all possible paths.
- **Visits to Nodes:** Each node can, in theory, be visited multiple times as there isn't a strict limit on revisits.

Thus, the time complexity is primarily exponential in the worst case as we explore all possible paths: \( O(n!) \), where \( n \) is the number of nodes in the graph. 

This approach might need optimization such as memoization or pruning to handle large graphs efficiently.
