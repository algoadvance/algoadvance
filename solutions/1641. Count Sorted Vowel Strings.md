title:  Count Sorted Vowel Strings-out
permalink: /s1641
---

Given an integer `n`, return the number of strings of length `n` that consist only of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and are lexicographically sorted.

A string `s` is lexicographically sorted if for all valid `i`, `s[i]` is the same as or comes before `s[i+1]` in the alphabet.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What should be returned when `n` is 0?
   - Normally, we assume `n` >= 1 because there would be no strings of vowels of length 0.
2. What if `n` is a very large number?
   - We should make sure our algorithm handles large values of `n` efficiently.
3. Do we need to handle any other characters other than 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'?
   - No, the problem constraints guarantee only vowels in the strings.

## Strategy

The strategy to solve this problem involves using dynamic programming (DP). The idea is to build the solution iteratively:

1. Define `dp[i][j]` to be the number of lexicographically sorted strings of length `i` that end with the `j-th` vowel.
2. `dp[0][*]` will be 1 because there's only one way to have an empty prefix.
3. For constructing a string of length `i`, if the previous character is the `k-th` vowel, all substrings ending in the `j-th` vowel with j >= k would be valid.
4. We sum the values for the next column in the DP table accordingly, maintaining the constraints of lexicographical order.

The main insight is to understand that each length increment can depend solely on the accumulated results of prior lengths.

## Code

```python
def countVowelStrings(n: int) -> int:
    # dp will be an array representing our current state of counts
    dp = [1] * 5
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(3, -1, -1):  # start from second last to the first
            dp[j] += dp[j + 1]
            
    return sum(dp)

# Test examples
print(countVowelStrings(1))  # Output: 5
print(countVowelStrings(2))  # Output: 15
print(countVowelStrings(33)) # Output: Large number
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**. This is because we have a double loop where the inner loop iterates a constant number of times (5 vowels), which is negligible compared to `n`.

1. The outer loop runs `n-1` times.
2. The inner loop always runs 5 times.

Therefore, the time complexity is \(O(n)\).

The space complexity of the solution is **O(1)** (constant space) because we use a fixed size list (of size 5) independent of the input size.

This makes the solution efficient and suitable even for large values of `n`.
