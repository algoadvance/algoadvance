title:  Pizza With 3n Slices-out
permalink: /s1388
---
You have a pizza with `3n` slices, and you want to share it with your friends. You will cut the pizza into exactly `3n` slices and each slice of pizza has a positive integer size. You should pick any `n` slices following these rules:

1. You cannot pick slices that are adjacent to each other (i.e., when you pick a slice at index `i`, you cannot pick the slice at index `i-1` and the slice at index `i+1`).

Return the maximum possible sum of `n` slices.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the slices be zero, or are they always positive integers? 
   - Answer: The slices' values are positive integers.
2. Is the pizza circular? For example, if I pick the last slice, can I not pick the first slice?
   - Answer: Yes, the pizza is circular. You cannot pick the first slice if you pick the last slice.

### Example
1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `slices = [1,2,3,4,5,6]`
   - Output: `10`
   - Explanation: Pick slice numbers `[3, 5, 6]` (1-based index) making the sum 10. 

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `slices = [8,9,8,6,1,1]`
   - Output: `16`
   - Explanation: Pick slice numbers `[9, 1, 6]` (1-based index) making the sum 16.

### Strategy
This problem is a variation of the "House Robber" dynamic programming problem where you need to deal specifically with a circular array.

#### Steps:
1. **Dynamic Programming on linear slices:** We will use a dynamic programming (DP) approach to solve the problem for a linear array, ensuring that we pick the best possible non-adjacent slices.
2. **Circular Array Handling:** As the pizza is circular, we will need to consider two cases:
   - Case 1: Consider slices from the first slice to the second-to-last slice.
   - Case 2: Consider slices from the second slice to the last slice.
3. **Combination of Results:** The final answer will be the maximum of the results from the two cases.

### Code
Let's implement the solution using the strategy discussed:

```python
def maxSizeSlices(slices):
    def max_size_subarray(slices):
        n = len(slices) // 3
        m = len(slices)
        
        # DP array to store maximum sum up to the i-th slice picking j slices
        dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
        
        for i in range(1, m + 1):
            for j in range(1, n + 1):
                if i == 1:
                    dp[i][j] = slices[i-1]
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-2][j-1] + slices[i-1])

        return max(dp[m])

    # Case 1: The array without the last element
    max1 = max_size_subarray(slices[:-1])
    # Case 2: The array without the first element
    max2 = max_size_subarray(slices[1:])
    
    # Result is the maximum of two cases
    return max(max1, max2)
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(3n^2)` where `n` is the number of slices to be chosen. This results from the nested looping through `m` elements and picking at most `n` slices.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(3n^2)` due to the DP table used to store intermediate results.

This solution efficiently handles the problem constraints and ensures that the maximum sum of non-adjacent slices is obtained considering the circular nature of the pizza.
