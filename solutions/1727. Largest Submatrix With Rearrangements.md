title:  Largest Submatrix With Rearrangements-out
permalink: /s1727
---

You are given a binary matrix `matrix` of size `m x n`, where each cell is either 0 or 1. You can rearrange the columns of the matrix in any order.

Return the area of the largest submatrix containing only 1's after reordering the columns optimally.

**Example:**

```python
matrix = [
  [0,0,1],
  [1,1,1],
  [1,0,1]
]
```
**Output:** 4

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can we change the values within the matrix?**
   - No, you can only rearrange the columns of the matrix.
   
2. **Are the rows and columns guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, the matrix will have at least one row and one column.

3. **What's the size limit for the matrix?**
   - The typical constraints will be up to \(300 \times 300\) as per similar top-tier problems.

## Strategy

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Calculate Column Heights:**
   - Convert the binary matrix into a height matrix where each cell represents the height of consecutive 1's up to that row. 

2. **Each Row as a Histogram:**
   - For each row (treated as a histogram of heights), sort the columns by height in non-increasing order to maximize the width of potential rectangles.

3. **Calculate Maximum Area:**
   - Iterate through the sorted heights and calculate the potential area by considering each height as the minimum height of a possible rectangle.
   - Keep track of the maximum area encountered.

### Pseudocode:
1. Convert the provided binary matrix into a "height" matrix.
2. For each row, sort the heights in non-increasing order.
3. For each height in a sorted row, compute the maximum rectangular area.

## Code

```python
def largestSubmatrix(matrix):
    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
        return 0
    
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    heights = [[0]*n for _ in range(m)]
    
    # Step 1: Prepare the height matrix
    for j in range(n):
        for i in range(m):
            if matrix[i][j] == 1:
                heights[i][j] = heights[i-1][j] + 1 if i > 0 else 1
    
    max_area = 0
    
    # Step 2 and 3: For each row sort the heights and calculate the maximal area
    for i in range(m):
        sorted_row = sorted(heights[i], reverse=True)
        for j in range(n):
            current_area = (j + 1) * sorted_row[j]
            max_area = max(max_area, current_area)
    
    return max_area

# Example usage
matrix = [
  [0,0,1],
  [1,1,1],
  [1,0,1]
]

print(largestSubmatrix(matrix))  # Output should be 4
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity breakdown is as follows:

- **Height Matrix Calculation:** O(m \* n)
  - We iterate through the matrix to compute the heights, which takes \(O(m \* n)\).

- **Sorting Each Row:** O(m \* n * log(n))
  - For each row, sorting takes \(O(n \log n)\) and we do this for \(m\) rows.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(m \* n \log n)\).

This solution is efficient for input size constraints typically presented in such problems.
