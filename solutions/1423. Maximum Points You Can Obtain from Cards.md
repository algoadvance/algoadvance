title:  Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards-out
permalink: /s1423
---

You have several cards `arranged in a row`, and each card has an associated number of points. The points are given in the integer array `cardPoints` where the `i-th` card has `cardPoints[i]` points. 

In one step, you can take one card from the beginning or from the end of the row. You have to take exactly `k` cards.

Your goal is to maximize the sum of the points of the cards you have taken.

Given the integer array `cardPoints` and the integer `k`, return the `maximum score` you can obtain.

### Example 1:
- Input: `cardPoints = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1], k = 3`
- Output: `12`
- Explanation: After taking the three cards, the optimal strategy is to take the last three cards, giving a maximum score of `1 + 6 + 5 = 12`.

### Example 2:
- Input: `cardPoints = [2, 2, 2], k = 2`
- Output: `4`
- Explanation: You have to take two cards. The optimal strategy is to take the first two cards or the last two cards.

### Example 3:
- Input: `cardPoints = [9, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 9], k = 7`
- Output: `55`
- Explanation: You have to take all the cards. The sum of all the cards is 55.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What is the minimum and maximum size of the `cardPoints` array?
   - The constraint is typically along the lines of `1 <= cardPoints.length <= 10^5`.
2. What is the range of values for the points on a card?
   - Typically, `1 <= cardPoints[i] <= 10^4`.
3. Is the value of `k` always less than or equal to the length of the `cardPoints` array?
   - Yes, `1 <= k <= cardPoints.length`.

## Strategy

To solve this problem optimally:

1. **Sliding Window Technique:**
   - Instead of trying to maximize the points by considering all possible ways to pick `k` cards from the beginning or the end, we can fix a window of size `k` that sums up to the elements from either side.
   - Calculate the initial sum of the first `k` cards from the left.
   - Use a sliding window, where we slide the window from the end of the `k` cards on the left to the beginning of the `k` cards on the right, while updating the sum by removing an element from the left and adding an element from the end.
   - Track the maximum sum encountered.

This approach ensures that we efficiently consider all possible combinations of picking `k` cards from both ends.

## Time Complexity

- The solution will traverse the array `cardPoints` once, leading to a time complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the `cardPoints` array.
- The space complexity is `O(1)` since we use a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.

## Code

```python
def maxScore(cardPoints, k):
    total_points = sum(cardPoints[:k])
    max_points = total_points
    n = len(cardPoints)
    
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        total_points = total_points - cardPoints[k - i] + cardPoints[n - i]
        max_points = max(max_points, total_points)
        
    return max_points

# Examples to test the function
print(maxScore([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1], 3))  # Output: 12
print(maxScore([2, 2, 2], 2))  # Output: 4
print(maxScore([9, 7, 7, 9, 7, 7, 9], 7))  # Output: 55
```

This code utilizes the sliding window approach mentioned and calculates the maximum points efficiently.
