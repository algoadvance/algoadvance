title:  Number of Ways to Paint N Ã— 3 Grid-out
permalink: /s1411
---

You have a `n` x 3 grid that you want to paint. Each cell of the grid can be painted in one of three colors: Red, Yellow, or Green. You need to paint the grid under the following two conditions:

1. No two adjacent cells have the same color.
2. All cells in a row are painted with different colors.

Given the integer `n`, return the number of ways to paint the `n` x 3 grid. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Example:
```
Input: n = 1
Output: 12
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on `n`?**
   - Typically, constraints like `1 <= n <= 5000` are provided for such problems, but the exact constraint would be found in the problem details.

2. **Are there any predefined functions that handle modulo operations, or should we include them in our calculations?**
   - We should include modulo operations within our algorithm to ensure that intermediate computations do not overflow.

3. **Do we need to consider special edge cases, like minimum value of `n` (i.e., `n=1`)?**
   - Yes, we need to consider that to initialize our calculations correctly.

## Strategy

To find the number of valid ways to paint the grid, we can deploy Dynamic Programming (DP) and observe the patterns:

1. **Base Case Analysis:**
   - For `n = 1`, it is possible to understand the valid configurations of a single row.
   
2. **Recursive Relationship:**
   - For each row `i`, we can derive its valid configurations (`ways(i)`) based on row `i-1`.

### Key Observations:
- Let's define two states:
  1. `A(i)`: Number of ways to paint row `i` such that any two adjacent cells have different colors and all three cells in the row have different colors.
  2. `B(i)`: Number of ways to paint row `i` such that any two adjacent cells have different colors but there are exactly two same-colored cells among the three cells.

### Transition:
1. `A(i) = 2 * A(i-1) + 2 * B(i-1)`
2. `B(i) = 2 * A(i-1) + 3 * B(i-1)`

### Base Case:
- For `n = 1`, these configurations can be calculated directly:
  - `A(1) = 6` (e.g., RGB, RBG, GRB, GBR, BRG, BGR)
  - `B(1) = 6` (e.g., RRG, RGR, GRR, BBR, BRB, GBR)

### Dynamic Programming:
- Compute these values iteratively for up to `n`.

### Time Complexity:
- O(n), since we only iterate up to `n`.
- Space Complexity: O(1), since we only store a constant number of state variables.

Here is the Python solution implementing the above strategy:

## Code

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def numOfWays(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 1:
        return 12
    
    A = 6  # for n=1
    B = 6  # for n=1
    
    for _ in range(2, n+1):
        newA = (2 * A + 2 * B) % MOD
        newB = (2 * A + 3 * B) % MOD
        A, B = newA, newB
    
    return (A + B) % MOD
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Time Complexity:** O(n) - We iterate through rows up to `n`.
2. **Space Complexity:** O(1) - Only a few variables are used for state storage.

This would solve the problem efficiently for the provided constraints.
