title:  Find Target Indices After Sorting Array-out
permalink: /s2089
---
You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `target`.

You need to determine the indices of the array where the value equals the target after sorting the array in non-decreasing order. Return these indices in the form of a list. If there are no such indices, return an empty list.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input constraints:** What are the constraints on the size of the array and the values of its elements?
   - `nums` can have length `[1, 100]`.
   - Each element in `nums` is an integer within the range `[1, 100]`.
2. **Output format:** Should the returned list be sorted?
   - Yes, since the array is sorted before determining the indices, the indices in the result will naturally be in ascending order.
3. **Edge cases:** What if the `target` is not present in the array at all?
   - The function should return an empty list.

### Strategy
1. **Sort the Array:** First, sort the array in non-decreasing order.
2. **Find Indices:** Iterate through the sorted array and collect the indices of the elements that match the target value.

### Code
Let's write the Python function to achieve this:

```python
def targetIndices(nums, target):
    # Step 1: Sort the array
    nums.sort()

    # Step 2: Find the indices of the target value
    result = []
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        if num == target:
            result.append(i)
    
    return result
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Sorting the array:** Sorting takes `O(n log n)` time, where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`.
2. **Finding indices:** Traversing the sorted array takes `O(n)` time.

Thus, the total time complexity of the solution is `O(n log n)`.

### Example
Let's test the function with an example:

```python
nums = [1, 2, 5, 2, 3]
target = 2
print(targetIndices(nums, target))  # Output should be [1, 2]
```

This example assumes the sorted array is `[1, 2, 2, 3, 5]`, and the target value `2` appears at indices `1` and `2`.
