title:  Minimum Money Required Before Transactions-out
permalink: /s2412
---

There are `n` transactions you must complete in order. Each transaction `i` is described by two integers: `costs[i]` and `cashbacks[i]`.

- `costs[i]` is the amount necessary to complete the transaction `i`.
- `cashbacks[i]` is the amount received back after completing the transaction `i`.

You start with 0 money. You need to determine the minimum amount of money required before starting these transactions so you don't run out of money at any point during the transactions.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Does the order of transactions matter?**
   - Yes, the transactions must be completed in the given order.

2. **What are the constraints on `costs[i]` and `cashbacks[i]`?**
   - The constraints are not provided specifically, but we can assume typical integer limits for algorithm problems unless specified otherwise.

3. **Can `costs[i]` be greater than `cashbacks[i]`?**
   - Yes, it's possible since it's the reason we are determining the minimum money needed before starting the transactions.

4. **Can the transactions have negative costs or cashbacks?**
   - Typically, neither costs nor cashbacks should be negative. We will assume they are non-negative integers.

### Strategy

To find the minimum amount of money required before starting the transactions, let's consider the following:

- We need to ensure that at any point during these transactions, our available money does not go negative.
- The highest deficit occurs when the difference between the cumulative cost and cashback is maximized.

We can use a simple simulation approach to calculate the required minimum balance by iterating over the transactions:

1. Track the current balance after every transaction.
2. Calculate the minimum balance needed to ensure that the balance never goes negative.

### Code Implementation

```python
def minimumMoney(costs, cashbacks):
    min_balance_needed = 0
    current_balance = 0
    
    for cost, cashback in zip(costs, cashbacks):
        current_balance -= (cost - cashback)
        if current_balance < 0:
            # The minimum balance needed is the negative of the minimum current_balance seen so far.
            min_balance_needed = max(min_balance_needed, -current_balance)
            
    return min_balance_needed

# Example usage:
costs = [10, 20, 30]
cashbacks = [5, 15, 20]
print(minimumMoney(costs, cashbacks))  # Output: 20
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of transactions. We need to iterate through each transaction once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we only use a few extra variables for tracking the current balance and minimum balance.

This approach efficiently calculates the minimum starting money required to complete all transactions in the given order without running out of money.
