The problem "Stone Game II" is described as follows:

Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are a number of piles, each pile has a positive integer number of stones piles[i]. The objective of the game is to take as many stones as possible; however, the number of piles that can be taken at each step is determined by a parameter `M`.

In the beginning, M is set to 1. Alice takes the first turn, then they alternate turns with Alice starting first. On each player's turn, that player can take 1 to 2M piles from the start of the row. However, after taking these piles, the value of M is updated to the maximum of M and the number of piles taken.

The game ends when there are no more piles left. The player with the most stones wins.

Implement a function to calculate the maximum number of stones Alice can obtain given the conditions described.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input and output format**:
    - Input: `piles`, a list of integers where each integer represents the number of stones in each pile.
    - Output: An integer that represents the maximum number of stones Alice can get.

2. **Constraints**:
    - 1 <= piles.length <= 100
    - 1 <= piles[i] <= 10^4

### Strategy

The problem can be solved using Dynamic Programming (DP). Let's define a DP table `dp[i][m]` which represents the maximum number of stones the current player can collect starting from index `i` with the current value of M being `m`. 

Here's a step-by-step overview to approach the problem:

1. **Initialization**: Create a memoization approach to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
2. **Transition**: For each state described by `dp[i][m]`, calculate the best possible moves for the current player by trying every possible number of piles (from 1 to `2M`) they can take. Update `M` accordingly and switch the player.
3. **Base Case**: When starting index `i` is greater than or equal to the length of the array, there are no more stones left to take.
4. **Result Calculation**: Alice starts the game with `dp[0][1]`.

### Code

```python
def stoneGameII(piles):
    n = len(piles)
    dp = {}

    def dfs(i, M):
        if (i, M) in dp:
            return dp[(i, M)]

        # If all piles are taken
        if i >= n:
            return 0

        # Suffix sum for optimization
        current_sum = 0
        max_stones = 0
        
        for x in range(1, 2*M + 1):
            if i + x > n:
                break
                
            current_sum += piles[i + x - 1]
            
            # Alice's current move sum + remaining stones Bob can get from i+x position
            max_stones = max(max_stones, current_sum + sum(piles[i + x:]) - dfs(i + x, max(M, x)))

        dp[(i, M)] = max_stones
        return max_stones
    
    return dfs(0, 1)
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is `O(n^3)` due to:
1. Each (i, M) can be computed in O(n) because in the worst case, we will consider taking piles from 1 to 2M, and M grows linearly with n.
2. We memoize results for each combination of i and M.

The space complexity is `O(n^2)` for the memoization table.

This solution effectively uses memoization to store already computed results, thus optimizing the process of determining the maximum stones Alice can collect starting from the first move.
