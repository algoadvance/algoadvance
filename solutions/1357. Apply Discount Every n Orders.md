title:  Apply Discount Every n Orders-out
permalink: /s1357
---
Design a system that applies a discount every n-th order. Implement the `Cashier` class with the following attributes and operations:

- A constructor `Cashier(int n, int discount, int[] products, int[] prices)` which initializes the object with `n` (the frequency of discount), `discount` (the discount percentage), `products` (array of product IDs), and `prices` (array of product prices).
- A method `getBill(int[] product, int[] amount)` which returns the total bill after applying the discount (where applicable) for the given products and their amounts.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Should the discount be applied immediately after every n-th order, or only to the n-th order itself?
2. Are product IDs unique, and can products have different prices at different instances?
3. What should be the initial count of orders before any order has been placed?

### Strategy:
1. Use a dictionary to map product IDs to their prices for quick lookup.
2. Keep an order counter to track how many orders have been processed.
3. Calculate the total bill without discount, and if the current order is an n-th order, apply the discount.
4. Increment the order counter with each `getBill` call.

### Code:
```python
class Cashier:

    def __init__(self, n: int, discount: int, products: List[int], prices: List[int]):
        self.n = n
        self.discount = discount
        self.products = {products[i]: prices[i] for i in range(len(products))}
        self.order_count = 0

    def getBill(self, product: List[int], amount: List[int]) -> float:
        self.order_count += 1
        
        total = 0
        
        # Calculate total bill
        for i in range(len(product)):
            product_id = product[i]
            product_amount = amount[i]
            total += self.products[product_id] * product_amount
        
        # Apply discount if it is the n-th order
        if self.order_count % self.n == 0:
            total = total * (1 - self.discount / 100)
        
        return total
```

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity for the `getBill` method is O(k), where k is the number of different products in the order. This is because we iterate over the product list to calculate the total.
- The time complexity for the `__init__` method is O(p), where p is the number of products, due to the dictionary construction.

This implementation ensures that checking and applying the discount is efficient, and the product price lookup is optimal due to the dictionary use.
