Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of all the **arithmetic subsequences** of `nums`. A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements, and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

A subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

### Example:

- Input: `nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`
- Output: `7`
- Explanation: All valid arithmetic subsequences are:
  - `[2, 4, 6]`
  - `[4, 6, 8]`
  - `[6, 8, 10]`
  - `[2, 4, 6, 8]`
  - `[4, 6, 8, 10]`
  - `[2, 4, 6, 8, 10]`
  - `[2, 6, 10]`

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Are all elements in the array distinct?**
   > Not necessarily; the array may contain duplicates.
   
2. **What is the maximum length of the array?**
   > The array length is up to 1000.
   
3. **Do all arithmetic subsequences need to have only integer differences?**
   > Yes, since the array contains only integers, the differences will also be integers.

### Strategy:

We'll use dynamic programming (DP) with a twist. We aim to keep track of arithmetic subsequences ending at each index. Specifically, we maintain a list of dictionaries where `dp[i][d]` represents the count of subsequences ending at index `i` with a common difference `d`.

#### Steps:

1. Initialize `dp` as a list of empty defaultdicts where each entry `dp[i]` represents differences and counts at index `i`.
2. Iterate through the array using two nested loops:
   - The outer loop (`i`) goes from the first to the last element.
   - The inner loop (`j`) goes from the start to `i-1`.
   - For each pair `(i, j)`, calculate the difference `d = nums[i] - nums[j]`.
   - Update the count of subsequences ending at `i` with difference `d` using the counts from `dp[j]`.
3. Sum up all counts of valid arithmetic subsequences of length at least 3.

### Code:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def numberOfArithmeticSlices(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    dp = [defaultdict(int) for _ in range(n)]
    total_count = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            difference = nums[i] - nums[j]
            subsequences_count = dp[j][difference]
            
            # Every subsequence ending at j with difference `d` can extend to i.
            dp[i][difference] += subsequences_count + 1
            
            # Count only the valid subsequences of length 3 or more
            total_count += subsequences_count
    
    return total_count

# Example usage:
nums = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
print(numberOfArithmeticSlices(nums))  # Output: 7
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input array. This is because we have a nested loop iterating through each pair of indices.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n \cdot k)\), where \(k\) is the number of unique differences that can be recorded. In the worst case, each index could have a distinct difference with every other index.

This approach ensures an efficient way to track and count arithmetic subsequences while avoiding repeated calculations.
