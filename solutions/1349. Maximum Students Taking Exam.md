title:  Maximum Students Taking Exam-out
permalink: /s1349

You are given a 2D array `seats` of size `m x n` where `seats[i][j]` can either be '.' (an empty seat) or '#' (a broken seat). An empty seat is represented by '.'. Students must sit in such a way that no two students can see each other. This is possible if there's no other student either directly in front, directly behind, or directly diagonal from that student's seat. Your task is to determine the maximum number of students that can take the exam without any two students being able to see each other from their seats.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can students be placed in the first column or row?
   - **A:** Yes, students can be placed in any position that is designated with a '.'.
   
2. **Q:** Is the position directly diagonal only considered in the left and right directions (i.e., top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right)?
   - **A:** Yes, diagonals in both directions are considered for visibility.

3. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the dimensions of the 2D array (`seats`)?
   - **A:** Yes, typically `m` and `n` (the dimensions of the array) are constrained to ensure the problem remains computationally feasible. Usually, `m` and `n` will be ≤ 8, allowing for more computationally intense algorithms like dynamic programming or bit-mask DP.

### Strategy
1. **Dynamic Programming with Bit Masking:**
   - Each row can be considered independently, and we can use bit masks to represent possible student placements.
   - For each bit in the bit mask:
     - `0` represents an empty seat or a broken seat.
     - `1` represents a student sitting in the seat.
   - Use DP to keep track of maximum students in a valid configuration of rows.
   - Ensure no two students can see each other directly or diagonally.

2. **State Representation:**
   - Use a DP array where `dp[j]` represents the maximum number of students that can sit in the classroom up to the current row with the current row in configuration `j` (where `j` is a bitmask).

3. **Transitions:**
   - Transition between rows ensuring no students in the next row can see students in the previous row according to the problem constraints.

### Code
```python
def maxStudents(seats):
    m, n = len(seats), len(seats[0])
    
    # Convert seats into integer array of valid positions mask
    valid_masks = [0] * m
    for i in range(m):
        mask = 0
        for j in range(n):
            if seats[i][j] == '.':
                mask |= (1 << j)
        valid_masks[i] = mask
    
    # Total possible states for a row
    total_states = 1 << n
    
    # Initialize DP array
    dp = [[-1 for _ in range(total_states)] for _ in range(m + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0
    
    def is_valid(mask, valid_mask):
        return (mask & ~valid_mask) == 0
    
    def no_conflict(mask1, mask2):
        return (mask1 & (mask2 >> 1)) == 0 and (mask1 & (mask2 << 1)) == 0
    
    max_students = 0
    
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for curr_mask in range(total_states):
            if is_valid(curr_mask, valid_masks[i - 1]):
                for prev_mask in range(total_states):
                    if dp[i - 1][prev_mask] != -1 and no_conflict(curr_mask, prev_mask):
                        dp[i][curr_mask] = max(dp[i][curr_mask], dp[i - 1][prev_mask] + bin(curr_mask).count('1'))
                        max_students = max(max_students, dp[i][curr_mask])
    
    return max_students

# Example usage:
seats = [
    ['#', '.', '#', '#', '.', '#'],
    ['.', '#', '#', '#', '#', '.'],
    ['#', '.', '#', '#', '.', '.'],
    ['.', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#'],
    ['#', '.', '.', '.', '#', '#']
]

print(maxStudents(seats))  # Expected output based on sample input
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(m * 2^n * 2^n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. This includes checking possible state transitions between rows.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m * 2^n), for storing DP states across `m` rows and `2^n` possible configurations per row.

This approach is efficient for reasonably small grids (e.g., where `m, n ≤ 8`).
