title:  Smallest Value After Replacing With Sum of Prime Factors-out
permalink: /s2507
---

You are given a positive integer `n`. Continuously replace `n` with the sum of its prime factors until `n` becomes a prime number. Return the smallest value `n` will take on.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - Is `n` always greater than 1?
    - What is the maximum value `n` can take?
   
2. **Prime Factorization**:
    - Do we need to consider the multiplicity of prime factors?

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - How should we handle small values like `2` and `3`, which are already prime numbers?

### Strategy

1. **Prime Check**: Write a helper function to check if a number is prime.
2. **Prime Factorization**: Write another helper function to perform prime factorization and return the sum of prime factors.
3. **Iterative Replacement**: Continuously replace `n` with the sum of its prime factors until `n` becomes a prime number.
4. **Return Result**: Return `n` once it becomes a prime.

### Code

```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def sum_of_prime_factors(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return 0
    sum_factors = 0
    # Count the number of 2s that divide n
    while n % 2 == 0:
        sum_factors += 2
        n //= 2
    # n must be odd at this point so a skip of 2 (i.e., i = i + 2) can be used 
    for i in range(3, int(n**0.5) + 1, 2):
        while n % i == 0:
            sum_factors += i
            n //= i
    # This condition is to check if n is a prime number greater than 2
    if n > 2:
        sum_factors += n
    return sum_factors

def smallest_value(n):
    while not is_prime(n):
        n = sum_of_prime_factors(n)
    return n
```

### Explanation

1. **is_prime Function**: 
    - Checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility starting from 2 up to the square root of the number.

2. **sum_of_prime_factors Function**: 
    - Performs prime factorization by dividing out the smallest prime factors first.
    - If any number remains after division by all primes up to the square root, it itself is a prime factor.

3. **smallest_value Function**: 
    - Continuously replaces `n` with the sum of its prime factors until `n` is prime.
    - Uses `is_prime` to check when to stop the loop.

### Time Complexity

1. **is_prime Function**:
    - The time complexity is \(O(\sqrt{n})\).

2. **sum_of_prime_factors Function**:
    - The time complexity is also \(O(\sqrt{n})\) primarily due to iterating up to the square root of `n`.

3. **smallest_value Function**:
    - Since we are iteratively reducing `n`, the overall complexity can be considered \(O(k \cdot \sqrt{n})\) where `k` is the number of iterations needed until `n` becomes a prime.

Combining these together, while the exact number of iterations `k` is data-dependent and hard to pin down precisely, the approach should be efficient for reasonable values of `n`.
