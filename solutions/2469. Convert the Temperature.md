title:  Convert the Temperature-out
permalink: /s2469
---

You are given a non-negative floating point number `celsius`, that denotes the temperature in Celsius. Your task is to convert the temperature from Celsius to both Kelvin and Fahrenheit, and return in a list `[kelvin, fahrenheit]`.

The conversions are defined as follows:
- Kelvin = Celsius + 273.15
- Fahrenheit = Celsius * 1.80 + 32.00

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**: What is the range for the input `celsius`?
   - **Response**: The input `celsius` is a non-negative floating point number.

2. **Output Precision**: Is there a specific precision required for the output values?
   - **Response**: The problem statement does not specify required precision, so we can assume standard floating point accuracy.

3. **Edge Cases**: Are there any specific edge cases we should be aware of?
   - **Response**: Considering the input is non-negative, edge cases could include `celsius = 0` and very large values of `celsius`.

## Strategy

To implement the solution:
1. Read the input value `celsius`.
2. Convert `celsius` to `kelvin` using the formula `kelvin = celsius + 273.15`.
3. Convert `celsius` to `fahrenheit` using the formula `fahrenheit = celsius * 1.80 + 32.00`.
4. Return the result as a list `[kelvin, fahrenheit]`.

By following these steps, we can ensure accurate conversion from Celsius to both Kelvin and Fahrenheit.

## Code

```python
def convertTemperature(celsius: float) -> list:
    kelvin = celsius + 273.15
    fahrenheit = celsius * 1.80 + 32.00
    return [kelvin, fahrenheit]

# Example usage:
print(convertTemperature(0))        # Expected output: [273.15, 32.00]
print(convertTemperature(100))      # Expected output: [373.15, 212.00]
print(convertTemperature(37.5))     # Expected output: [310.65, 99.50]
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this problem is O(1) because the operations we are performing (addition and multiplication) are constant time operations. We are performing a fixed number of operations regardless of the size of the input. Thus, the solution is effectively constant time.
