title:  Partition String Into Substrings With Values at Most K-out
permalink: /s2522
---

You are given a string `s` consisting of digits from `'1'` to `'9'`, and an integer `k`. A substring `s[i:j]` can be converted from string to integer. The task is to determine the minimum number of substrings into which the string `s` can be partitioned so that each substring represents an integer less than or equal to `k`.

Return the smallest number of substrings from the given string `s` such that each substring follows the mentioned property. If it is impossible to partition string `s` satisfying the conditions, return `-1`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "3521", k = 50
Output: 3
Explanation: We can partition "3521" like "3", "5", "21".
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "10001", k = 1
Output: -1
Explanation: It is impossible to partition "10001" such that each part is less than or equal to 1.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are we guaranteed that `s` does not contain the digit '0'?**  
   Yes, the problem states that `s` consists of digits from `'1'` to `'9'`.

2. **Can the length of `s` be 1?**  
   Yes, the length of `s` can be any positive integer.

3. **Can `k` be very large compared to the characters in `s`?**  
   Yes, but each substring considered should be less than or equal to `k`.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach. 

1. We initialize a counter for the number of partitions.
2. We iterate through the string `s`, keeping track of the current substring, making sure it remains less than or equal to `k`.
3. If adding a new digit to the current substring makes it larger than `k`, we start a new partition.

## Code

```python
def min_partitions(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    n = len(s)  # Length of the string
    num_partitions = 0  # Counter for the partitions
    i = 0  # Pointer to iterate through the string

    while i < n:
        current_number = 0  # Initialize current substring number
        
        while i < n and current_number * 10 + int(s[i]) <= k:
            current_number = current_number * 10 + int(s[i])
            i += 1
            
        if current_number == 0:  # If we're unable to form a valid number
            return -1
        
        num_partitions += 1  # We formed one partition

    return num_partitions

# Example usage:
print(min_partitions("3521", 50))  # Output: 3
print(min_partitions("10001", 1))  # Output: -1
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. We try to form valid partitions in a single pass through the string. 

## Space Complexity

The space complexity of this solution is **O(1)** since we are only using a few integer variables to keep track of the current part and number of partitions.
