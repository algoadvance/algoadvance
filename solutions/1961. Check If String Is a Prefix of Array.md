title:  Check If String Is a Prefix of Array-out
permalink: /s1961
---
1. Are there any constraints on the length of the string or the length of the array?
2. Are the elements of the array always non-empty strings?
3. What should be the output if either the string or the array is empty? Should we assume such cases will not occur?

Once these questions are clarified, we can proceed with a more detailed strategy and implementation. Assuming typical constraints found on LeetCode:

1. The length of the string and the combined length of the array's strings can be reasonably large (up to 10^4 characters).
2. Elements in the array are non-empty strings.
3. We need to handle edge cases where either the string or the array might be empty.

### Strategy
To determine if the given string `s` is a prefix of the concatenated elements of the array `words`, we can follow these steps:

1. **Concatenation of Words**: Concatenate the elements of `words` until their combined length is at least as long as `s`.
2. **Prefix Check**: Check if the resulting concatenated string starts with `s`.
3. **Efficiency Considerations**: Avoid concatenating more characters than necessary to minimize time and space usage.

### Time Complexity
The approach involves iterating through each word and possibly part of each word until the combined length is sufficient. Thus, the time complexity is O(n + m), where `n` is the length of the string `s` and `m` is the total length of all words in `words` up to the necessary length.

### Code

```python
def isPrefixString(s: str, words: List[str]) -> bool:
    concatenated = ""
    for word in words:
        concatenated += word
        if len(concatenated) >= len(s):
            return concatenated.startswith(s)
    return False

# Example Use Case
s = "iloveleetcode"
words = ["i", "love", "leetcode", "apples"]
print(isPrefixString(s, words))  # Output: True
```

### Explanation
1. **Concatenate**: Start with an empty string `concatenated`.
2. **Iterate**: Iterate through each word in `words`.
   - Add the current word to `concatenated`.
   - If the length of `concatenated` is greater than or equal to the length of `s`, check if `concatenated` starts with `s`. Return `True` if it does.
3. **Return False**: If the loop completes without finding a match, return `False`.

This solution ensures we only concatenate what is necessary and check for the prefix as early as possible, keeping the operation efficient.
