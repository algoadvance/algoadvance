title:  Sort Array By Parity II-out
permalink: /s922
---
Given an array of integers `nums`, half of the integers in `nums` are odd, and the other half are even. The requirement is to sort the array so that whenever `nums[i]` is odd, `i` is odd, and whenever `nums[i]` is even, `i` is even.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [4, 2, 5, 7]
Output: [4, 5, 2, 7]
Explanation: [4, 7, 2, 5], [2, 5, 4, 7], and [2, 7, 4, 5] would also be correct.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Will the input array always contain half even numbers and half odd numbers?
   - Yes.
2. Can the array length be zero?
   - No, it is guaranteed that there is at least one even and one odd number in the array.
3. Should the solution be in-place, or can we use additional space?
   - Either solution is acceptable as long as it meets the problem constraints.

### Strategy
We can use a two-pointer approach:
1. One pointer (`even_idx`) will focus on even indices and will seek the next odd number located at an even index.
2. Another pointer (`odd_idx`) will focus on odd indices and will seek the next even number located at an odd index.

We will then swap these misplaced numbers to ensure they are in the correct positions.

### Code
```python
def sortArrayByParityII(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    even_idx, odd_idx = 0, 1
    
    while even_idx < n and odd_idx < n:
        if nums[even_idx] % 2 == 0:
            even_idx += 2
        elif nums[odd_idx] % 2 == 1:
            odd_idx += 2
        else:
            # Swap the misplaced values
            nums[even_idx], nums[odd_idx] = nums[odd_idx], nums[even_idx]
            even_idx += 2
            odd_idx += 2
    
    return nums

# Example usage
print(sortArrayByParityII([4, 2, 5, 7]))  # Output could be [4, 5, 2, 7] or any other valid configuration
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array. Each element is processed at most twice.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as we are performing the sorting in-place using only a constant amount of extra space.

This solution effectively rearranges the array by ensuring that all even indices contain even numbers and all odd indices contain odd numbers through a series of swaps.
