title:  Top K Frequent Elements-out
permalink: /s347
---
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent elements. You may return the answer in any order.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size**: Is there a constraint on the size of the input array `nums`?
   - Typical constraints might be: `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4` and `k` such that `1 <= k <= nums.length`.
   
2. **Value Range**: Are there any constraints on the values contained within `nums`?
   - Typically: `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`.

3. **Uniqueness of k**: Can the `k` frequent elements include ties (i.e., multiple elements having the same frequency)? 
   - Yes, typically we just need to return any `k` elements that are most frequent.

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the following steps:

1. **Count frequency of elements**: Use a `Counter` from the `collections` module to tally the frequency of each element in the array.
2. **Use a heap to find the top `k` elements**: 
    - Pythonâ€™s `heapq` can help us maintain a heap of size `k` to keep track of the most frequent elements.
    - Utilize a min-heap because it allows efficient ways to keep the `k` most frequent elements by frequency.

### Code
Let's implement the solution using these steps:

```python
from collections import Counter
import heapq

def topKFrequent(nums, k):
    # Step 1: Count frequency of each element
    count = Counter(nums)
    
    # Step 2: Use a heap to extract the k most frequent elements
    # Python's heapq is a min-heap
    heap = []
    
    for num, freq in count.items():
        heapq.heappush(heap, (freq, num))  # Push (frequency, num) tuple
        if len(heap) > k:
            heapq.heappop(heap)  # Ensure the heap keeps only k elements
    
    # Extract the numbers from the heap
    result = [num for freq, num in heap]
    
    return result

# Example usage
print(topKFrequent([1,1,1,2,2,3], 2))  # Output: [1, 2]
print(topKFrequent([1], 1))  # Output: [1]
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Counting frequencies**: This takes O(n) time, where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`.
2. **Heap operations**: For each element in the `count`, pushing and popping from the heap takes O(log k) time.
   - Given there are at most `n` elements, heap operations will take O(n log k) time.
3. **Overall Complexity**: The total time complexity is O(n + n log k), which simplifies to O(n log k).

By efficiently using a frequency count and a min-heap, this approach ensures that we can find the top `k` frequent elements within a reasonable time frame even for large input sizes.
