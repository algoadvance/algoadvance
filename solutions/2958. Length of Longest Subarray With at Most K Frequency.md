title:  Length of Longest Subarray With at Most K Frequency-out
permalink: /s2958
---
You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `k` and `limit`. Your task is to find the length of the longest subarray where no number appears more than `k` times and the subarray sum is less than or equal to `limit`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: 
   - Will `nums` always contain at least one element?
   - What is the range of values for `k` and `limit`?

2. **Output**:
   - Should the function return an integer representing the length of the subarray?

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - What if all elements in `nums` are the same and `k` is 1?
   - What if `limit` is very large or very small?

### Code
```python
def longest_subarray(nums, k, limit):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    start = 0
    max_length = 0
    current_sum = 0
    freq = defaultdict(int)

    for end in range(len(nums)):
        num = nums[end]
        freq[num] += 1
        current_sum += num
        
        while freq[num] > k or current_sum > limit:
            freq[nums[start]] -= 1
            current_sum -= nums[start]
            start += 1

        max_length = max(max_length, end - start + 1)
    
    return max_length

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 2, 1, 2, 1, 2, 2]
k = 2
limit = 10
print(longest_subarray(nums, k, limit))  # Output should be 6
```

### Strategy
1. **Sliding Window**: Use a sliding window approach to maintain the current subarray from `start` to `end`. This approach helps efficiently calculate properties over a subarray.
2. **Frequency Map**: Use a dictionary to maintain the frequency of elements within the current window. This helps in quickly verifying the frequency condition.
3. **Condition Checking**: For every new element added (`end` pointer):
   - Increase its frequency count and add its value to the current_sum.
   - Check if the frequency of any element exceeds `k` or if the sum exceeds `limit`.
   - If either condition is violated, move the `start` pointer to the right until both conditions are satisfied.
4. **Track Maximum Length**: Continuously update the maximum length of valid subarrays encountered.

### Time Complexity
- **O(n)**: The algorithm processes each element at most twice (once when expanding the window and once when contracting it), resulting in a linear time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m), where `m` is the number of unique elements in `nums`, due to the space required for the frequency map.
