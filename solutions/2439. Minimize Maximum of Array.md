title:  Minimize Maximum of Array-out
permalink: /s2439
---
You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` comprising `n` non-negative integers.

You can perform the following operation on the array any number of times:
- Choose an integer `i` such that `1 <= i < n` and `nums[i] > nums[i-1]`.
- Decrease `nums[i]` by 1 and increase `nums[i-1]` by 1, i.e., `nums[i] -= 1` and `nums[i-1] += 1`.

Your goal is to minimize the maximum value in the array.

Return the minimum possible value of the maximum integer of `nums` after performing any number of such operations.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can `nums` be empty or contain a single element?
   - No, `nums` will contain at least two elements as the constraint `1 <= i < n` requires `n >= 2`.
2. Are there any constraints on the size of the elements in `nums` or the size of the array `nums` itself?
   - Yes, `n` (the size of the array) will be in a reasonable range, and the elements are non-negative integers.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to achieve equilibrium where adjacent values do not differ much. Here’s a combination of logic and steps we’ll follow:

1. **Binary Search the Minimum Maximum Value:** We will use binary search to determine the minimum possible maximum value (`M`) of the array after operations.
2. **Check Feasibility of a Particular `M`:** For a chosen `M` from the binary search, validate if it's possible to reduce the array such that its maximum value is `M` or less using the described operations.

### Code

```python
def minimizeArrayValue(nums):
    def canAchieve(x):
        total = 0
        for num in nums:
            if num > x:
                total += num - x
            else:
                total -= (x - num)
            if total < 0:
                total = 0
        return total == 0
    
    left, right = max(nums), sum(nums) // len(nums) + 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if canAchieve(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left

# Example usage:
nums = [3, 7, 1, 6]
result = minimizeArrayValue(nums)
print(result)  # Should output the minimum possible maximum integer
```

### Explanation
1. **Binary Search Range:** 
    - `left` starts as the maximum value in the array (`max(nums)`) because the maximum value can't be less than the largest element by definition.
    - `right` starts as the average of the array rounded up (`sum(nums) // len(nums) + 1`), since we can't reduce below this without violating the problem constraints.
   
2. **Feasibility Check (`canAchieve` function):**
    - Walk through the array and calculate how much “excess” beyond `x` is generated.
    - Use this "excess" to adjust future elements more evenly.
    - If at any point, the "total" drops below zero, it means we can balance the values under `x`.
   
3. **Binary Search Execution:**
    - Use binary search to find the smallest value of `x` which passes the `canAchieve` check.

### Time Complexity
- **Binary Search Part:** Running in `O(log(max_element - average_value))`.
- **Feasibility Check:** Each check runs in `O(n)`.

So the overall complexity is effectively `O(n * log(max_element))`, which should be efficient for typical input sizes.

This method ensures that we find the minimum possible maximum value efficiently using binary search and validation checks.
