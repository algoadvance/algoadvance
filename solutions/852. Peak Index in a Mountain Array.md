title:  Peak Index in a Mountain Array-out
permalink: /s852
---

Given an array of integers `arr` that is a mountain array, return the peak index in the mountain array.

A mountain array is defined as an array that:

- `arr.length >= 3`
- There exists some `i` with `0 < i < arr.length - 1` such that:
  - `arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]`
  - `arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]`

You must solve it in `O(log(n))` time complexity.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned when there are multiple peaks?**
   - The problem guarantees a unique peak because of the definition of a mountain array.
  
2. **Are there any constraints on the values of the array elements?**
   - The array elements will be integers, but no specific range is given.

3. **Can the input array have duplicate values?**
   - Based on the definition of a mountain array, there should be no duplicates around the peak.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently in `O(log(n))` time complexity, we can use a binary search approach. Here's how:

- Initialize two pointers, `left` at the start of the array and `right` at the end of the array.
- While `left` is less than `right`:
  - Find the middle index `mid`.
  - If `arr[mid]` is less than `arr[mid + 1]`, it means the peak is in the right half, so move `left` to `mid + 1`.
  - Otherwise, if `arr[mid]` is greater than or equal to `arr[mid + 1]`, it means the peak is in the left half, so move `right` to `mid`.
- When the loop exits, `left` will be pointing at the peak index.

### Code

```python
def peakIndexInMountainArray(arr: int) -> int:
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] < arr[mid + 1]:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid
    return left
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(log(n))` because each step of the binary search cuts the search space in half.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` because no additional space is used that scales with the input size.
