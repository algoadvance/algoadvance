title:  Number of Times Binary String Is Prefix-Aligned-out
permalink: /s1375
---

You're given a binary string `s` of length `n`. You decide to select some prefix of the binary string and flip all the bits (i.e., change every `0` to `1` and every `1` to `0`). What is the maximum number of times you can select and flip a prefix of this binary string such that after each flip, the binary string remains different from the target binary string after flipping each prefix?

Your task is to implement an algorithm to determine the maximum number of times you can select and flip a prefix of the binary string as per the given conditions.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Size and Limits**:
   - What is the typical maximum length of the string `n`?
   - The prompt mentions flipping prefixes. Does it mean starting from the leftmost element up to the ith position in the string?
   
2. **Initial Conditions**:
   - Are we guaranteed that the input string `s` contains only '0' and '1' characters?

Let's assume the maximum length of `s` is manageable within typical constraints for a coding interview (say, `n <= 10^5`).

## Code:

```python
def numTimesPrefixAligned(s):
    max_times = 0
    max_flipped = 0
    
    for i in range(len(s)):
        current_bit = int(s[i])
        
        if current_bit == 1:
            max_flipped = max(max_flipped, i + 1)
        
        if max_flipped == i + 1:
            max_times += 1
            
    return max_times

# Example usage:
s = "100110"
print(numTimesPrefixAligned(s))  # Expected output based on the problem constraints
```

## Strategy:

1. **Flip Concept**:
   - Each flip operation transforms the string. Our goal is to find out how many such valid operations we can perform without making the string match any previous flipped version (target after each flip).
   
2. **Tracking Flips**:
   - We need to track the possible maximum extent to which we can flip to keep the string changed from a previously seen configuration.
   
3. **Efficient Check**:
   - Utilize a single pass to count the operations when the flipped portion makes the entire prefix aligned differently.

## Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - We traverse the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) - We use a constant amount of space outside of the input.
