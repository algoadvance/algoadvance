title:  Count the Number of Good Partitions-out
permalink: /s2963
---

You are given a list of integers. A "good partition" is defined as a way of splitting the list into two non-empty parts such that the sum of the elements in the first part is equal to the sum of the elements in the second part. Your task is to count the number of good partitions of the list.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for the integers in the list?** 
   - All integers are within typical computational limits unless specified otherwise.

2. **What is the size limit of the list?**
   - The list can have up to 10^5 elements.

3. **Can the list contain negative numbers?**
   - This is generally unlikely in such partition problems. If it does, it should be explicitly mentioned.

4. **How should we handle edge cases like small lists?**
   - For lists smaller than 2 elements, no partitions are possible.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total sum** of the array. If the total sum is odd, then it's impossible to split the array into two parts with equal sum, as two equal parts would sum to an even number.

2. **Iterate through the list** while maintaining the cumulative sum. At each step, check if the cumulative sum equals half of the total sum. If it does, it means the rest of the list sums to half of the total sum, thus identifying a good partition.

3. Using a single pass through the list and maintaining a running sum allows us to solve this problem efficiently.

### Code

```python
def count_good_partitions(nums):
    total_sum = sum(nums)
    
    # If the total sum is odd, no possible way to partition
    if total_sum % 2 != 0:
        return 0
    
    target_sum = total_sum // 2
    current_sum = 0
    good_partitions = 0
    
    for num in nums[:-1]:  # We avoid checking at the very last element to ensure non-empty partitions
        current_sum += num
        if current_sum == target_sum:
            good_partitions += 1
    
    return good_partitions
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the input list. This is because we make a single pass through the list to calculate the running sum and check for good partitions.

- **Space Complexity** is **O(1)**, as we only use a few extra variables and do not require additional data structures proportional to the input size.
