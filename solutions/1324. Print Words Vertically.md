title:  Print Words Vertically-out

Given a string `s`. Return all the words vertically in a list.  
Words are returned in the same order they appear in the given string.  
If there is only one word in the string, return a list containing the one word itself.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters.

A vertical word corresponds to arranging the characters of a word column by column. If a column does not have enough characters, it should be filled with spaces `' '`.

For example, if you are given the input string "HOW ARE YOU", the output should be:
```
[
  "HAY",
  "ORO",
  "WEU"
]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format:**
   - Is the string `s` guaranteed to contain at least one word and no leading or trailing spaces?
   - Are there any special characters in the string, or is it guaranteed to consist of only letters and spaces?

2. **Output Format:**
   - Should the columns be trimmed of trailing spaces before being put in the list?

### Example
```python
s = "TO BE OR NOT TO BE"
# Output will be
[
"TBONTB",
" OEROE",
"   E  "
]
```

### Strategy
1. **Split the String**: First, split the string into words using the built-in `split()` method.
2. **Determine Maximum Length**: Find out the maximum length among these words to figure out how many rows the vertical words will have.
3. **Prepare Output List**: Initialize an empty list to store each vertical word.
4. **Construct Vertical Words**: Iterate through each index (up to the maximum length) for all words and construct the vertical words, appending spaces if a word is shorter than the current index.
5. **Remove Trailing Spaces**: Make sure that trailing spaces are trimmed from each vertical word.

### Code
```python
def printVertically(s: str):
    words = s.split()
    max_len = max(len(word) for word in words)
    vertical_words = []

    for i in range(max_len):
        vertical_word = ""
        for word in words:
            if i < len(word):
                vertical_word += word[i]
            else:
                vertical_word += " "
        vertical_words.append(vertical_word.rstrip())
    
    return vertical_words

# Example Usage
s = "TO BE OR NOT TO BE"
print(printVertically(s))  # Output: ["TBONTB", " OEROE", "   E  "]
```

### Time Complexity
- **Splitting the String**: O(n) where `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
- **Finding Maximum Length**: O(w) where `w` is the number of words.
- **Constructing Vertical Words**: O(w * l) where `w` is the number of words and `l` is the maximum length of the words.

Overall, the time complexity is O(n + w * l).
