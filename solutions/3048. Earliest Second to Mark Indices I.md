title:  Earliest Second to Mark Indices I-out
permalink: /s3048
---

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `arr`. You are also given an integer `k` and want to mark `k` indices in the array.

Initially, all indices are unmarked. You are allowed to mark an index if it is either unmarked or already marked.

For every index `i`, you mark all the unmarked indices from index `0` to index `i`, and you would like to know the earliest second (in terms of marking operations) in which the number of marks reaches `k`.

The time `mark(i)` denotes the ith second required to make all unmarked indices from `0` to `i` marked.

Return the earliest second when the number of marked indices reaches `k`. If it is impossible or `k <= 0`, return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input array `arr` contain negative numbers or zeros?
2. What is the range of values for `k`? Can `k` be greater than the length of the array `arr`?
3. Is repeated marking of indices allowed, or does it influence the count of marks?
4. What are the constraints for the size of the array `arr`?

## Strategy
1. Iterate through the array `arr` and mark indices while keeping track of how many indices have been marked.
2. Maintain a count of marked indices and update it as you iterate through the array.
3. Return the earliest second (index `i`) where the total number of marks reaches `k`.
4. If unable to mark `k` indices, return `-1`.

## Code

Here is a Python implementation for solving this problem:

```python
def earliest_mark_indices(arr, k):
    # Edge case: if k is less than or equal to 0, return -1 immediately
    if k <= 0:
        return -1
    
    # Initialize the marked count
    marked_count = 0
    n = len(arr)
    
    # Iterate through the array to mark indices
    for i in range(n):
        # Mark all unmarked indices from 0 to i
        marked_count += 1
        
        # Check if `marked_count` has reached `k`
        if marked_count == k:
            return i  # Return the current second when marked_count reaches k
        
    # If marked_count never reaches k, return -1
    return -1
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the array. This is because we are iterating through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This solution ensures that we efficiently find the earliest second to mark `k` indices or return `-1` if it's not possible.
