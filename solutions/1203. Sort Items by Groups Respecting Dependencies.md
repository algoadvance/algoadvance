title:  Sort Items by Groups Respecting Dependencies-out
permalink: /s1203
---
You have `n` items, each belonging to zero or one of `m` groups where `group[i]` is the group to which the `i-th` item belongs and it's -1 if the i-th item does not belong to any group. The items are to be sorted such that:
1. The items in each group appear consecutively.
2. You can pick any group and sort all the items inside it arbitrarily.
3. There are some dependencies between items.

Given:
- An integer `n` denoting the number of items.
- An integer `m` denoting the number of groups.
- An array `group` where `group[i]` is the group to which the i-th item belongs.
- A 2D array `beforeItems` where `beforeItems[i]` is a list of all items `j` that should appear before the `i-th` item.

Return a sorted list of the items respecting the given dependencies and groups. If there is no valid sorting, return an empty list.

### Strategy

1. **Understand Dependencies and Groupings**:
   - Treat the problem as a graph problem where nodes are items and directed edges represent dependencies (beforeItems).
   - Each item belongs to exactly one group or no group at all.
   - Need topological sorting within groups and topological sorting among groups.

2. **Steps to Solve**:
   - **Step 1**: Assign items to their respective groups. If an item has no assigned group, assign a new, unique group id to it.
   - **Step 2**: Create topological sorting for items within each group using Kahn's algorithm or Depth-First Search (DFS) based topological sort.
   - **Step 3**: Create topological sorting for the groups. An edge from group A to group B means there's at least one dependency that an item in group B must come after an item in group A.
   - **Step 4**: Merge the results of group sorting and within-group item sorting to get the final order.
   
### Time Complexity

- Topological sorting each group: `O(n + e)` where `e` is the number of dependencies.
- Combining groups and sorting groups: `O(m + e)`.

The overall complexity is `O(n + m + e)` where `n` is the number of items, `m` is the number of groups, and `e` is the number of dependencies.

### Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def sortItems(n, m, group, beforeItems):
    # Assign unique groups to items with no group
    new_group_id = m
    for i in range(n):
        if group[i] == -1:
            group[i] = new_group_id
            new_group_id += 1
    
    # Create adjacency list and in-degree list for items and groups
    item_graph = defaultdict(list)
    item_indegree = [0] * n
    group_graph = defaultdict(list)
    group_indegree = [0] * new_group_id
    
    # Build item graph and group graph
    for i in range(n):
        for pre in beforeItems[i]:
            item_graph[pre].append(i)
            item_indegree[i] += 1
            if group[pre] != group[i]:
                group_graph[group[pre]].append(group[i])
                group_indegree[group[i]] += 1
    
    # Topological sort function
    def topo_sort(graph, indegree, nodes):
        zero_indegree_queue = deque([node for node in nodes if indegree[node] == 0])
        sorted_list = []
        
        while zero_indegree_queue:
            node = zero_indegree_queue.popleft()
            sorted_list.append(node)
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                indegree[neighbor] -= 1
                if indegree[neighbor] == 0:
                    zero_indegree_queue.append(neighbor)
        
        return sorted_list if len(sorted_list) == len(nodes) else []
    
    # Get topological sort of groups
    group_sorted = topo_sort(group_graph, group_indegree, list(range(new_group_id)))
    if not group_sorted:
        return []
    
    # Get topological sort of items within each group
    item_sorted_within_group = {}
    for g in range(new_group_id):
        items_in_group = [i for i in range(n) if group[i] == g]
        sorted_items = topo_sort(item_graph, item_indegree, items_in_group)
        if not sorted_items:
            return []
        item_sorted_within_group[g] = sorted_items
    
    # Combine the sorted groups and items within each group
    result = []
    for g in group_sorted:
        result.extend(item_sorted_within_group[g])
    
    return result
```

### Conclusion
This solution uses topological sorting twice: once for sorting items within each group and once for sorting the groups themselves. If at any point the sort is not possible due to cycles in the graph, it returns an empty list. The solution efficiently handles the sorting considering the provided dependencies and group constraints.
