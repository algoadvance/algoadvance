title:  Maximum Product Subarray-out
permalink: /s152
---

Given an integer array `nums`, find a contiguous non-empty subarray within the array that has the largest product, and return the product.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the array include negative numbers?
   - **A:** Yes, the array can include both positive and negative numbers.
   
2. **Q:** Can the array have zero values?
   - **A:** Yes, zero values can be present in the array.
  
3. **Q:** What is the range of the length of the array?
   - **A:** The length of the array can be between 1 and 20000.

4. **Q:** What is the range of the values of the elements in the array?
   - **A:** The values of the elements can range from `-10` to `10`.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we need to iterate through the array while keeping track of three key values during each step:
- `max_product` which stores the maximum product encountered so far.
- `min_product` which stores the minimum product encountered so far (important because multiplying two negative numbers can yield a positive product, which might be the maximum product at a later stage).
- `result` which will store the final maximum product subarray.

The main idea is to update `max_product` and `min_product` at each element in the array and compute `result` as the maximum value of `max_product` at each step.

### Code
```python
def maxProduct(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    
    max_product = min_product = result = nums[0]
    
    for num in nums[1:]:
        if num < 0:
            max_product, min_product = min_product, max_product
        
        max_product = max(num, max_product * num)
        min_product = min(num, min_product * num)
        
        result = max(result, max_product)
    
    return result
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because we only need to iterate through the array once.

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: Start with the first element of the array for `max_product`, `min_product`, and `result`.
2. **Iteration**: For each element in the array (starting from the second element):
   - If the element is negative, swap `max_product` and `min_product` because multiplying by a negative number flips the signs.
   - Update `max_product` to be the maximum of the current element and the product of `max_product` with the current element.
   - Update `min_product` to be the minimum of the current element and the product of `min_product` with the current element.
   - Update `result` to keep track of the maximum product encountered so far.
3. **Return**: the maximum product subarray stored in `result`.

This method ensures that we consider the effects of negative numbers and zeroes efficiently while maintaining a linear time complexity.
