title:  Decode Ways-out

---
A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:
```
'A' -> "1"
'B' -> "2"
...
'Z' -> "26"
```
To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped, and each letter corresponds to a number from 1 to 26.

Given a string `s` containing only digits, return the number of ways to decode it. It is guaranteed that `s` contains no leading zero.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "12"
Output: 2
Explanation: "12" could be decoded as "AB" (1 2) or "L" (12).
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "226"
Output: 3
Explanation: "226" could be decoded as "BZ" (2 26), "VF" (22 6), or "BBF" (2 2 6).
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "06"
Output: 0
Explanation: "06" cannot be mapped because the number "0" does not map to any letter.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are there any invalid characters in the string, such as non-digit characters?
   **A:** No, the string `s` contains only digits.

2. **Q:** Can the string contain leading zeros?
   **A:** No, it is guaranteed that `s` contains no leading zero.

3. **Q:** What is the length of the string `s`?
   **A:** The length can vary, but it depends on the specific test cases.

## Strategy

This problem can be approached using dynamic programming. We can use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to decode the substring `s[:i]`.

### Steps:
1. Initialize a DP array of size `n + 1` (where `n` is the length of the string `s`).
2. The base case `dp[0]` is set to `1` because an empty string has one way to be decoded (doing nothing).
3. Iterate through the string and update the DP array based on the following rules:
   - If `s[i-1]` (a single character) is a valid single-digit decode (1-9), then `dp[i] += dp[i-1]`.
   - If the substring `s[i-2:i]` (two characters) is a valid two-digit decode (10-26), then `dp[i] += dp[i-2]`.

### Code
```python
def numDecodings(s: str) -> int:
    n = len(s)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    
    # dp array to store the number of ways to decode each substring
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 1  # An empty string has one way to be decoded
    
    # Check the first character of the string
    dp[1] = 1 if s[0] != '0' else 0
    
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        # Check one character back
        if s[i-1] != '0':
            dp[i] += dp[i-1]
        
        # Check two characters back
        two_digit = int(s[i-2:i])
        if 10 <= two_digit <= 26:
            dp[i] += dp[i-2]
    
    return dp[n]
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string. We iterate over the string once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, since we use an array `dp` of size `n + 1`.
