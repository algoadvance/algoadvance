title:  Insert Delete GetRandom O(1)-out

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Operations Supported**: The problem asks us to support insert, delete, and getRandom operations with average O(1) time complexity. Are there any constraints on the number of operations?
2. **Element Uniqueness**: Should the data structure handle duplicate elements or assume all elements are unique?
3. **Output Requirements**: During the `getRandom` operation, should we ensure a uniform random distribution of the elements?

Based on the problem name and customary constraints, we assume:

1. We need to support `insert(val)`, `delete(val)`, and `getRandom()`.
2. Elements are unique.
3. `getRandom()` should return a random element from the set of current elements, with each element having an equal probability of being returned.

### Strategy

To achieve average O(1) time complexity for all operations, we can use:
- A list to store elements.
- A dictionary to store the indices of elements in the list.

**Insert Operation**:
- Append the element to the list and record its index in the dictionary.

**Delete Operation**:
- Find the element in the dictionary, get its index from the list, and swap it with the last element in the list.
- Update the dictionary with the new position of the swapped element.
- Remove the element from both the list and dictionary.

**GetRandom Operation**:
- Use Python's `random.choice` to get a random element from the list.

### Code

```python
import random

class RandomizedSet:
    def __init__(self):
        self.elements_list = []
        self.elements_dict = {}

    def insert(self, val: int) -> bool:
        if val in self.elements_dict:
            return False
        self.elements_dict[val] = len(self.elements_list)
        self.elements_list.append(val)
        return True

    def delete(self, val: int) -> bool:
        if val not in self.elements_dict:
            return False
        # Index of the element to delete
        idx_to_remove = self.elements_dict[val]
        # Move the last element to the spot of the element to remove
        last_element = self.elements_list[-1]
        self.elements_list[idx_to_remove] = last_element
        self.elements_dict[last_element] = idx_to_remove
        # Remove the last element
        self.elements_list.pop()
        del self.elements_dict[val]
        return True

    def getRandom(self) -> int:
        return random.choice(self.elements_list)

# Example Usage
# randomizedSet = RandomizedSet()
# print(randomizedSet.insert(1))    # True
# print(randomizedSet.insert(2))    # True
# print(randomizedSet.getRandom())  # Could be 1 or 2
# print(randomizedSet.delete(1))    # True
# print(randomizedSet.getRandom())  # Should be 2
```

### Time Complexity
- `insert(val)`: Average O(1), since dictionary operations (insert) and list append are O(1).
- `delete(val)`: Average O(1), since dictionary operations (lookup and delete) and list operations (swap and pop) are O(1).
- `getRandom()`: O(1), as `random.choice` on a list is O(1).

This approach ensures all operations meet the required time complexity on average.
