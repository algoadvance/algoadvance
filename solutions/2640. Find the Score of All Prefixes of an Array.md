title:  Find the Score of All Prefixes of an Array-out
permalink: /s2640
---
You are given an array `nums` of size `n`. You need to find the score of all prefixes of the array. The score of a prefix is defined as the product of the maximum element in the prefix and the sum of elements in the prefix. The prefix score for prefix ending at index `i` is given by:

\[ \text{score}[i] = \max(\text{nums}[0], \text{nums}[1], \ldots, \text{nums}[i]) \times (\text{nums}[0] + \text{nums}[1] + \ldots + \text{nums}[i]) \]

Return an array containing the score of all prefixes.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are there any constraints on the elements of the array?**
   - You may assume that the elements of the array are integers.

2. **What is the range of the size of the array?**
   - You may assume `1 <= n <= 10^5` and `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`.

3. **Is there any constraint on the time complexity of the solution?**
   - We should be aiming to find a solution in linear time, O(n), as the given constraint on array size can go up to 100,000.

### Strategy
To solve the problem efficiently, we'll iterate through the array while maintaining:
1. The current maximum value in the prefix.
2. The sum of elements in the prefix.

By doing this, for each index `i`, we'll be able to compute the prefix score in constant time.

### Code
```python
def find_prefix_scores(nums):
    n = nums.length
    scores = [0] * n
    current_max = float('-inf')
    prefix_sum = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        current_max = max(current_max, nums[i])
        prefix_sum += nums[i]
        scores[i] = current_max * prefix_sum
        
    return scores
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize `scores` array of length `n` to store the prefix scores.
   - Set `current_max` to negative infinity to ensure that any element in the array will be larger initially.
   - Initialize `prefix_sum` to 0 to start accumulating the sum of elements in the prefix.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each index `i` in the array:
     - Update `current_max` with the maximum of `current_max` and `nums[i]`.
     - Add `nums[i]` to `prefix_sum`.
     - Calculate the score for the current prefix and store it in `scores[i]`.

3. **Result**:
   - Return the `scores` array containing the prefix scores.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input array, since we only make a single pass through the array.
- The space complexity is **O(n)** as well, due to the storage of the `scores` array.

This should be efficient enough given the constraint that `n` can be as large as 100,000.
