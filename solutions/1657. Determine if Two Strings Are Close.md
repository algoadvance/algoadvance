title:  Determine if Two Strings Are Close-out
permalink: /s1657
---

You are given two strings, `word1` and `word2`. Two strings are considered close if you can attain one from the other using the following operations:

1. Swap any two existing characters.
2. Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character, and do the same with the other character (i.e., essentially swap the characters).

Return `true` if you can attain word1 from word2, or vice-versa; otherwise, return `false`.

**Example 1:**
```plaintext
Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "bca"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```plaintext
Input: word1 = "a", word2 = "aa"
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**
```plaintext
Input: word1 = "cabbba", word2 = "abbccc"
Output: true
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 10^5`
- `word1` and `word2` consist of only lowercase English letters.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Should we ignore case differences (e.g., 'A' vs 'a')?
   - **Answer:** No, all characters are lowercase English letters.
   
2. Are the strings always non-empty?
   - **Answer:** Yes, given the constraint `1 <= word1.length, word2.length`.

3. Is there a restriction on the characters used in the strings?
   - **Answer:** Both strings consist only of lowercase English letters.

### Strategy

To determine if `word1` and `word2` are close, we need to check the following:
1. They must contain the same set of unique characters.
2. They must have the same frequency of character frequencies, meaning the frequency distribution of characters must be identical.

Steps:
1. Count the frequency of each character in both `word1` and `word2`.
2. Check if the sets of unique characters are the same.
3. Check if the sorted lists of the frequency values are the same.

### Code

Here is the Python code to implement the solution:

```python
from collections import Counter

def closeStrings(word1: str, word2: str) -> bool:
    if len(word1) != len(word2):
        return False
    
    freq1 = Counter(word1)
    freq2 = Counter(word2)
    
    # Compare unique characters
    if set(freq1.keys()) != set(freq2.keys()):
        return False
    
    # Compare the sorted lists of frequencies
    if sorted(freq1.values()) != sorted(freq2.values()):
        return False
    
    return True

# Example tests
print(closeStrings("abc", "bca"))  # Output: True
print(closeStrings("a", "aa"))     # Output: False
print(closeStrings("cabbba", "abbccc"))  # Output: True
```

### Time Complexity

- Constructing the frequency counters: \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the strings.
- Comparing sets and sorted frequency lists: \(O(U \log U)\) where \(U\) is the number of unique characters (at most 26 for lowercase English letters).

Overall time complexity: \(O(n + U \log U)\). Given that \(U\) is at most 26, this simplifies to \(O(n)\).

The solution should be efficient for the input size constraints.
