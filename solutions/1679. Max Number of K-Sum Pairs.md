title:  Max Number of K-Sum Pairs-out
permalink: /s1679
---

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. In one operation, you can pick two numbers from the array whose sum equals `k` and remove them from the array. Your goal is to maximize the number of operations you can perform.

**Function Signature:**
```python
def maxOperations(nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
```

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 5
Output: 2

Input: nums = [3,1,3,4,3], k = 6
Output: 1
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Can the same element be re-used in different pairs?**
   - A: No, once an element is used in a pair and removed, it cannot be re-used.

2. **Q: What if there are multiple valid pairs for the same element?**
   - A: We just need to maximize the number of operations, so we can pick any valid pair.

3. **Q: Are the elements in the array guaranteed to be positive?**
   - A: The problem statement does not impose this restriction, so elements could be negative as well. 

4. **Q: What if the input array `nums` is empty?**
   - A: In such a case, the result should be 0 as there are no elements to form pairs.

### Strategy

To maximize the number of K-sum pairs in an array, we should employ a two-pointer technique combined with sorting, or use a hash map to count frequencies. Here's the plan:

1. **Sort the Array (Two-pointer Technique):**
   - Sort `nums`.
   - Use two pointers starting from the beginning (`left`) and the end (`right`) of the array.
   - If the sum of `nums[left]` and `nums[right]` equals `k`, count it as a valid operation and move both pointers inward.
   - If the sum is less than `k`, move the `left` pointer to the right to increase the sum.
   - If the sum is more than `k`, move the `right` pointer to the left to decrease the sum.

2. **Hash Map Count Approach:**
   - Use a hash map (or dictionary) to store the frequencies of elements.
   - For each element in the array, check if `k - element` is in the hash map. If it is, it's a valid pair; decrement the count of `k - element`.
   - If not, store/increment the count of the current element in the hash map.

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting + Two-pointer:** O(n log n) time for sorting and O(n) for traversal, resulting in a total of O(n log n).
- **Hash Map Count:** O(n) time for traversal and O(1) average time for hash map operations, resulting in a total of O(n).

Given these strategies, I'll provide the implementation using the hash map approach as it is typically more efficient.

### Code

```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict

def maxOperations(nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
    freq = defaultdict(int)
    operations = 0

    for num in nums:
        if freq[k - num] > 0:
            operations += 1
            freq[k - num] -= 1
        else:
            freq[num] += 1
            
    return operations
```

### Explanation

- **Initialize `freq`:** A default dictionary to count frequencies of elements.
- **Iterate through `nums`:** For each number, check if `k - num` exists in `freq`.
- **Count Operation:** If `k - num` is found, increment the `operations` and decrement `freq` for `k - num`.
- **Update Frequency:** Otherwise, increment the count for `num` in `freq`.
- **Return Operations:** Finally, return the total operations performed.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find and count the K-sum pairs with a time complexity of O(n).
