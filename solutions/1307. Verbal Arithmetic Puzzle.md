title:  Verbal Arithmetic Puzzle-out

You are given an equation, represented by words, where each letter represents a unique digit (i.e., 0-9). The input strings are num1, num2 (two words) and the sum (another word). We need to determine whether there is a valid assignment of digits to letters such that when these words are interpreted as numbers, the equation num1 + num2 = sum holds true.

The constraint is that no number should start with the digit '0' except the number 0 itself.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the words always in uppercase?**
   - Yes, the words are always in uppercase as specified.
2. **Do we need to handle invalid input cases?**
   - No, assume the input is always valid and follows the given constraints.
3. **Can letters repeat across different words?**
   - Yes, the same letter can appear in different words but still must represent the same digit.

### Strategy
1. **Backtracking Approach**: 
   We will use a backtracking algorithm to try assigning digits to each letter and check if they can form a valid equation. 
   
2. **Base Case**:
   - If all letters are assigned and the equation holds true, return True.
   - If all letters are assigned but the equation does not hold, backtrack.

3. **Constraints**:
   - Ensure that no assigned number starts with '0' unless the number is '0'.
   - Ensure all assigned digits are unique.
  
4. **Steps**:
   - Create a set or array to keep track of used digits.
   - Recursively attempt to assign each available digit to each letter.
   - Check the validity of the assignment by converting the words to numbers and checking the equation.

### Code
```python
def isSolvable(words, result):
    from itertools import permutations
    
    letters = set(''.join(words) + result)
    if len(letters) > 10:
        return False
    
    def word_to_number(word, char_to_digit):
        return int(''.join(str(char_to_digit[char]) for char in word))
    
    def valid_assignment(perm):
        char_to_digit = {char: digit for char, digit in zip(letters, perm)}
        if any(char_to_digit[word[0]] == 0 for word in words + [result]):
            return False
        words_sum = sum(word_to_number(word, char_to_digit) for word in words)
        result_number = word_to_number(result, char_to_digit)
        return words_sum == result_number
    
    for perm in permutations(range(10), len(letters)):
        if valid_assignment(perm):
            return True
    return False

words = ["SEND", "MORE"]
result = "MONEY"
print(isSolvable(words, result))  # Output: True
```

### Time Complexity
The solution employs a backtracking approach with permutations of digits for the letters. Given `n` unique letters, permutations have a time complexity of `O(10^n * n)`. This is quite computationally expensive for large `n`. For `n` up to 10 (given constraints), it is manageable but inefficient. 

**Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for the `letters` set and the `char_to_digit` mapping.

This code attempts all possible assignments of digits to characters and checks whether any of them satisfy the equation, ensuring a valid solution if it exists.
