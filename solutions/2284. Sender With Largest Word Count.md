title:  Sender With Largest Word Count-out
permalink: /s2284
---

You have a list of messages sent by different senders. Each message contains only lowercase English letters and spaces. The message denotes a sentence, and the sentence contains words separated by a single space. A word is defined as a non-space character sequence. You need to find the sender with the largest word count in their messages. If there is a tie, return the lexicographically smallest sender.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the maximum length of the `messages` list?
   - What is the maximum length of each message string?
   - Are there any special characters or just lowercase letters and spaces?

2. **Output Clarifications**:
   - What should the function return if no messages are given?

Assumptions:
- The `messages` list can have up to \(10^4\) elements.
- Each message string can be at most \(10^4\) characters long.
- A message contains only lowercase English letters and spaces.
   
### Strategy

1. **Parse Messages**: Traverse through the list of messages, and for each message, count the number of words by splitting the string on spaces and counting the resultant list length.
   
2. **Track Words by Sender**: Use a dictionary to maintain a count of words sent by each sender.
   
3. **Identify the Sender**: After calculating the word count for each sender, iterate through the dictionary to identify the sender with the maximum word count. In case of a tie, select the sender who comes lexicographically first.
   
### Code

```python
def largestWordCount(messages, senders):
    word_count_by_sender = {}
    
    for i, message in enumerate(messages):
        sender = senders[i]
        word_count = len(message.split())
        
        if sender not in word_count_by_sender:
            word_count_by_sender[sender] = 0
        word_count_by_sender[sender] += word_count
    
    max_word_count = 0
    max_sender = ""
    
    for sender, count in word_count_by_sender.items():
        if count > max_word_count or (count == max_word_count and sender < max_sender):
            max_word_count = count
            max_sender = sender
    
    return max_sender

# Example usage
messages = ["Hello World", "Hi there", "Are you available today"]
senders = ["Alice", "Bob", "Alice"]
print(largestWordCount(messages, senders))  # Should return "Alice"
```

### Time Complexity

- **Splitting Each Message**: Each message split operation takes \(O(L)\) where \(L\) is the length of the message. Given `n` messages, the total complexity is \(O(n \cdot L)\).
- **Dictionary Operations**: Insertions and updates in a dictionary are average-case \(O(1)\). Thus, for `n` messages, it will take \(O(n)\).
- **Finding the Maximum Sender**: Scanning through the sender dictionary takes \(O(m)\) where \(m\) is the number of unique senders. In the worst case, \(m\) can be \(n\).

Overall time complexity is:
\[ O(n \cdot L + m) \]
Given \( m \leq n \), it simplifies to \( O(n \cdot L) \).

### Space Complexity

- **Storage of Messages and Senders**: Lists of size `n` for messages and senders.
- **Dictionary Storage**: Space used by the dictionary is \(O(m)\), where \(m \leq n\).

Overall space complexity is \(O(n + m)\), which also simplifies to \(O(n)\).
