A matrix is called Toeplitz if every diagonal from top-left to bottom-right has the same elements. Now given an `m x n` matrix, return `True` if the matrix is Toeplitz. Otherwise, return `False`.

A matrix can be defined as a two-dimensional array.

### Example 1:
```
Input:
matrix = [
  [1,2,3,4],
  [5,1,2,3],
  [9,5,1,2]
]
Output: True
```
Explanation: In the given matrix, each diagonal from top-left to bottom-right has the same elements.

### Example 2:
```
Input:
matrix = [
  [1,2],
  [2,2]
]
Output: False
```
Explanation: The diagonal starting at (0,0) contains 1 and 2 which are different.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What are the constraints on the size of the matrix?**
   - Usually, the size of the matrix will be constrained by typical computational limits. However, let's assume practical bounds like 0 <= m, n <= 10^4 if not explicitly stated otherwise.

2. **Could the matrix be empty?**
   - We should handle this edge case and assume an empty matrix returns `True` because there are no elements to form a conflicting diagonal.

### Strategy:
To determine whether the given matrix is a Toeplitz matrix, we need to ensure that each element in the matrix is equal to the element diagonally before it. Specifically, for every element at position `(i, j)`, it must hold that `matrix[i][j] == matrix[i-1][j-1]` if both `i-1` and `j-1` are within the matrix bounds.

### Pseudocode:
- Traverse through the matrix starting from the second row and the second column.
- For each element at `(i, j)`, check if it is equal to the element at `(i-1, j-1)`.
- If any such comparison fails, return `False`.
- If no comparison fails, return `True`.

### Code:
```python
def isToeplitzMatrix(matrix):
    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
        return True

    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])

    for i in range(1, rows):
        for j in range(1, cols):
            if matrix[i][j] != matrix[i-1][j-1]:
                return False

    return True
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Check**: We first check if the matrix is empty or if its first row is empty. If so, we return `True`.
2. **Iterate through Elements**: We loop through the matrix starting from `i=1` and `j=1` because the first row and column do not need to be checked.
3. **Diagonal Comparison**: For each element `(i, j)`, we compare it with its top-left diagonal neighbor `(i-1, j-1)`.
4. **Return Result**: If any diagonal check fails, we return `False`. If all checks pass, we return `True`.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the matrix. This is because we are iterating through each element in the matrix once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, since we are only using a constant amount of extra space for our variables.

This algorithm efficiently verifies if the given matrix is Toeplitz by leveraging direct element comparison based on their indices within the bounds of the matrix.
