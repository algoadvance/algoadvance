title:  Odd Even Jump-out
permalink: /s975
---

You are given an integer array `A`. From some starting index, you can make a series of jumps. The odd numbered jump (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) entails jumping to the smallest index `j` such that `A[i] <= A[j]` and `j > i`. The even numbered jump (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) entails jumping to the largest index `j` such that `A[i] >= A[j]` and `j > i`. If there are multiple such indices, you jump to the smallest index. A starting index is good if, starting from that index, you can reach the end of the array (index `A.length - 1`) by jumping some number of times. Return the number of good starting indices.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the maximum size of the array `A`?
   - Typically, LeetCode array sizes can go up to 10^5 elements. Is that the upper limit here?
2. **Array Elements**: Can `A` contain duplicate elements, and what is the range of values in `A`?
3. **Constraints**: Are we allowed to use additional data structures, or do we need to solve it in-place?

### Strategy

1. **Nested Loop Promises Inefficiency**: Given the context and constraints, using nested loops to find the next indices directly would be inefficient with a high complexity. So, we'll avoid this.
2. **Precompute Jumps**: Instead, we'll precompute the next higher (`odd jumps`) and lower (`even jumps`) indices using data structures that facilitate it efficiently.
3. **Use a Stack**: To find the next smaller and larger indices efficiently, we can use a monotonic stack along with sorting the indices based on values for each type of jump.
4. **Dynamic Programming**: With the jumps precomputed, we can then use dynamic programming to determine from which indices we can reach the end of the array.

### Implementation

```python
def oddEvenJumps(A):
    n = len(A)
    if n == 1:
        return 1
    
    # These arrays will store if it's possible to reach the end from index i
    odd = [False] * n
    even = [False] * n
    odd[-1] = even[-1] = True
    
    # To next greater element (for odd jumps) and next smaller element (for even jumps)
    next_higher = [None] * n
    next_lower = [None] * n

    # Monotonic stacks to help with finding the next greater/smaller elements
    sorted_indices = sorted(range(n), key=lambda i: (A[i], i))
    stack = []
    for i in sorted_indices:
        while stack and stack[-1] < i:
            next_higher[stack.pop()] = i
        stack.append(i)

    sorted_indices.sort(key=lambda i: (-A[i], i))
    stack = []
    for i in sorted_indices:
        while stack and stack[-1] < i:
            next_lower[stack.pop()] = i
        stack.append(i)

    # Use DP to determine if we can reach the end from index i
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        if next_higher[i] is not None:
            odd[i] = even[next_higher[i]]
        if next_lower[i] is not None:
            even[i] = odd[next_lower[i]]
    
    # The answer is the count of indices from which we can start and eventually reach the end
    return sum(odd)

# Example usage:
A = [10,13,12,14,15]
print(oddEvenJumps(A))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting and Stack Operations**: Both sorting operations on indices and stack manipulations run in \(O(n \log n)\).
2. **Dynamic Programming Loop**: Iterating and computing reachability via the DP approach requires \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

This approach ensures efficient and clear computation of the problem within permissible limits.
