title:  Increasing Triplet Subsequence-out
permalink: /s334
---

Given an integer array `nums`, return `true` if there exists a triple of indices `(i, j, k)` such that `i < j < k` and `nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k]`. If no such indices exist, return `false`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of elements in `nums`?**
   - Typically, `nums` would range from `-10^9` to `10^9`, unless mentioned otherwise.
   
2. **What is the range of the length of `nums`?**
   - `nums` can be empty or have up to `10^5` elements.

3. **Should the solution handle duplicate values in `nums`?**
   - Yes, the solution should handle duplicate values properly.

4. **Is there any specific time complexity requirement?**
   - Ideally, we aim for a solution that is better than O(N^2). An optimal solution would be O(N) time complexity with O(1) space complexity.

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can maintain two variables:
- `first`: This keeps track of the smallest value encountered so far.
- `second`: This keeps track of the smallest value encountered after `first`.

The idea is to:
1. Traverse through the list.
2. Update `first` when a smaller value is found.
3. Update `second` if it is greater than `first` but less than the current value. When `second` is updated, it implies we have found the second number in the triplet.
4. If we encounter a value greater than both `first` and `second`, it means we have found our triplet.

## Code

Here's the Python function to implement the above logic:

```python
def increasingTriplet(nums):
    first = second = float('inf')
    
    for n in nums:
        if n <= first:
            first = n  # smallest value
        elif n <= second:
            second = n  # second smallest value
        else:
            return True  # found a value bigger than both 'first' and 'second'
    
    return False

# Example Test Cases
print(increasingTriplet([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Expected output: True
print(increasingTriplet([5, 4, 3, 2, 1]))  # Expected output: False
print(increasingTriplet([2, 1, 5, 0, 4, 6]))  # Expected output: True
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the length of the array `nums`. This is because we are doing a single pass over the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using only a fixed amount of extra space.

This efficient solution meets the requirements and constraints of the problem statement.
