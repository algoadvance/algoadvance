title:  Uncommon Words from Two Sentences-out
permalink: /s884
---

Given two sentences `s1` and `s2`, return a list of all the uncommon words. A word is uncommon if it appears exactly once in one of the sentences, and does not appear in the other sentence.

### Example:

```python
Input: s1 = "this apple is sweet", s2 = "this apple is sour"
Output: ["sweet","sour"]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the length of the sentences?**
   - Sentences are likely to be reasonably short due to typical input limits in coding challenges.

2. **Are the words in the sentences case-sensitive?**
   - The problem implicitly assumes case-sensitivity since there are no instructions to standardize case.

3. **What are the word delimiters in the sentences?**
   - Words are typically separated by spaces in a sentence.

4. **Will there be any punctuation in the sentences?**
   - The example provided involves punctuation-free sentences, suggesting we can assume no punctuation for simplicity.

5. **How should we treat empty sentences?**
   - If a sentence is empty, it has no uncommon words by definition.

## Strategy

1. **Split each sentence into words**:
   - Use Python's `str.split()` method to break sentences into lists of words.

2. **Count occurrences of each word**:
   - Utilize a dictionary (or collections.Counter) to count the occurrences of each word across both sentences.

3. **Find uncommon words**:
   - A word is uncommon if it occurs exactly once in the combined words of both sentences.

4. **Filter out these words**:
   - Construct a list of words that occur exactly once in the combined dataset.

## Code

```python
from collections import Counter

def uncommonFromSentences(s1, s2):
    # Split the sentences into words
    words_s1 = s1.split()
    words_s2 = s2.split()
    
    # Count the occurrences of each word
    word_count = Counter(words_s1 + words_s2)
    
    # Extract words which have exactly one occurrence
    uncommon_words = [word for word, count in word_count.items() if count == 1]
    
    return uncommon_words

# Example usage:
s1 = "this apple is sweet"
s2 = "this apple is sour"
print(uncommonFromSentences(s1, s2))  # Output: ["sweet", "sour"]
```

## Time Complexity

- **Splitting sentences into words**:
  - `O(n + m)` where `n` is the length of `s1` and `m` is the length of `s2`.
  
- **Counting word occurrences**:
  - Also `O(n + m)` because each word insertion/check in hashmap is `O(1)` on average, and we have `n + m` words in total.

- **Filtering uncommon words**:
  - This involves iterating over the hashmap, which has at most `n + m` entries resulting in `O(n + m)`.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n + m)`. The space complexity is also `O(n + m)` due to the storage used for splitting words and the hashmap for counting occurrences.
