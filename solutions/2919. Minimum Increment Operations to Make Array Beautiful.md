title:  Minimum Increment Operations to Make Array Beautiful-out
permalink: /s2919
---

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. In one operation, you can increment any element of the array by `1`.

- An array is considered beautiful if the minimum number of distinct integers in the array is equal to its length.

For example, `[1, 2, 3, 4]` is beautiful because it contains 4 distinct integers.
Your goal is to make the array beautiful with the minimum number of increment operations. 

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make the array beautiful.

**Constraints**:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Should the array contain exactly `n` distinct integers where `n` is the length of the array?
2. Is there any restriction on the value to which an element can be incremented?
3. Can the input array contain negative numbers?
4. Is the order of elements in the array important?

Assuming the goal is to convert the array into one where each element is unique and the order of elements is not important.

## Strategy

1. **Sort the array:** Sorting helps in easily identifying duplicates and how far each duplicate is from becoming unique.
2. **Identify duplicates:** Traverse through the sorted array and keep track of numbers we need to change to make each element unique.
3. **Increment operations:** Calculate the number of steps required to make duplicates unique.

## Code

```python
def minIncrementForUnique(nums):
    nums.sort()
    moves = 0
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] <= nums[i - 1]:
            needed_increment = nums[i - 1] - nums[i] + 1
            nums[i] += needed_increment
            moves += needed_increment
    return moves

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 1, 3, 2, 2]
print(minIncrementForUnique(nums))  # Output should be 2
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting the array:** \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Traversing the array:** \(O(n)\)

The overall time complexity is dominated by the sort operation, which is \(O(n \log n)\).

## Explanation

1. **Sorting the Array:** Sorting helps to place duplicates next to each other, simplifying detection and incrementation.
2. **Changing Duplicates:** During the traversal, if an element is found to be less than or equal to the previous element, calculate the needed increment to make it unique and add that increment to the moves counter.
3. The result is the minimum number of operations needed to make all elements unique.
