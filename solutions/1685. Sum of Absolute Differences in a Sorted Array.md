title:  Sum of Absolute Differences in a Sorted Array-out
permalink: /s1685
---
Given a sorted array `nums` of integers, return the array `result` such that `result[i]` is the sum of absolute differences between `nums[i]` and all the other elements in the array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Is the array guaranteed to be sorted in non-decreasing order?
    - Yes, the array `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
2. Can the array contain duplicate elements?
    - Yes, the array can contain duplicate elements.
3. What is the expected size of the array?
    - The array can be large, up to 10^5 elements.
4. Are there any constraints on the values within the array?
    - The elements of the array will be within the range `[-10^4, 10^4]`.

### Strategy
To efficiently solve this problem, consider leveraging the sorted property of the array:

1. **Prefix Sum Approach**:
    - Compute prefix sums to efficiently calculate the sum of elements before and after the current element.
      - Use `prefix_sum[i]` to represent the sum of elements from the start up to the `i`-th element.
      - Use `suffix_sum[i]` to represent the sum of elements from the `i`-th element to the end.
    - Using prefix sums, the sum of absolute differences can be decomposed into two parts for each element at index `i`:
      - Differences with elements before the `i`-th element.
      - Differences with elements after the `i`-th element.

2. **Mathematical Composition**:
    - The sum of absolute differences for an element at index `i` can be broken down as follows:
      - `result[i] = i * nums[i] - prefix_sum[i] + (suffix_sum[i] - (n - i) * nums[i])`

### Code

```python
def getSumAbsoluteDifferences(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    prefix_sum = [0] * n
    suffix_sum = [0] * n
    
    prefix_sum[0] = nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + nums[i]
        
    suffix_sum[n - 1] = nums[n - 1]
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        suffix_sum[i] = suffix_sum[i + 1] + nums[i]
        
    result = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        if i > 0:
            left_sum = i * nums[i] - prefix_sum[i - 1]
        else:
            left_sum = 0

        if i < n - 1:
            right_sum = suffix_sum[i + 1] - (n - i - 1) * nums[i]
        else:
            right_sum = 0

        result[i] = left_sum + right_sum
        
    return result

# Example usage:
nums = [2,3,5]
print(getSumAbsoluteDifferences(nums)) # Output: [4,3,5]
```

### Explanation

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
    - Compute `prefix_sum` where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of elements from the start to the `i`-th index.

2. **Suffix Sum Calculation**:
    - Compute `suffix_sum` where `suffix_sum[i]` is the sum of elements from the `i`-th index to the end.

3. **Result Calculation**:
    - For each index `i`, calculate the sum of absolute differences using the prefix and suffix sums.
    - Result for `result[i]` is computed using the differences:
      - For elements before `i`: `i * nums[i] - prefix_sum[i - 1]`
      - For elements after `i`: `suffix_sum[i + 1] - (n - i - 1) * nums[i]`

### Time Complexity
- **Prefix Sum Calculation**: \( O(n) \)
- **Suffix Sum Calculation**: \( O(n) \)
- **Result Calculation**: \( O(n) \)
- Overall time complexity is \( O(n) \).

This ensures the solution is efficient and meets the requirements even for large inputs of up to \( 10^5 \) elements.
