title:  Three Consecutive Odds-out
permalink: /s1550
---

Given an integer array `arr`, return `true` if there are three consecutive odd numbers in the array. Otherwise, return `false`.

_Example 1:_
```python
Input: arr = [2,6,4,1]
Output: false
Explanation: There are no three consecutive odds.
```

_Example 2:_
```python
Input: arr = [1,3,5,7]
Output: true
Explanation: [1, 3, 5] are three consecutive odds.
```

_Example 3:_
```python
Input: arr = [1, 2, 34, 3, 4, 5, 7, 23, 12]
Output: true
Explanation: [5, 7, 23] are three consecutive odds.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Is the input array always non-empty?
2. What is the size range of the input array?
3. Can the input array contain negative numbers?

Assuming general constraints of LeetCode problems:
- The input array can have a length of up to \( 10^4 \).
- The elements of the array can be large and might include negative numbers.

### Strategy

1. Traverse through the array while checking each number to see if it is odd.
2. Maintain a counter that counts consecutive odd numbers.
3. Reset the counter to zero whenever an even number is encountered.
4. If the counter reaches 3 at any point, return `true`.
5. If the entire array is traversed and no three consecutive odd numbers are found, return `false`.

### Code

Let's implement this strategy in Python.

```python
def three_consecutive_odds(arr):
    count = 0
    for num in arr:
        if num % 2 != 0:  # Check if the number is odd
            count += 1
            if count == 3:
                return True
        else:
            count = 0  # Reset the counter if the number is even
    return False

# Test examples
print(three_consecutive_odds([2,6,4,1]))  # Output: False
print(three_consecutive_odds([1,3,5,7]))  # Output: True
print(three_consecutive_odds([1, 2, 34, 3, 4, 5, 7, 23, 12]))  # Output: True
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the input array. This is because we are traversing the array only once.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \), as we are using a constant amount of extra space (only a few integer variables).

This solution efficiently checks for three consecutive odd numbers in the array within linear time.
