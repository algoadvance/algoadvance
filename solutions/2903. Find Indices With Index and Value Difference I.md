title:  Find Indices With Index and Value Difference I-out
permalink: /s2903
---
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return all the indices `i` for which `nums[i] - i` is divisible by `k`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What if there are no valid indices?**
   - Return an empty list in that case.

2. **Can the input array contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, it can contain negative numbers.

3. **Are the array elements distinct?**
   - The uniqueness of array elements doesn't matter for this problem.

4. **Can `k` be zero?**
   - No, `k` will be a non-zero integer, as division by zero is undefined.

### Strategy:
1. Initialize an empty list `result` to store the indices.
2. Iterate through the array `nums`.
3. For each index `i`, check if `(nums[i] - i) % k == 0`.
   - If true, append `i` to the list `result`.
4. Return the list `result`.

### Code:
```python
def find_indices(nums, k):
    result = []
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if (nums[i] - i) % k == 0:
            result.append(i)
    return result

# Example usage:
nums = [5, 3, 6, 2, 9]
k = 3
print(find_indices(nums, k))  # Output: [0, 2]
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: We are iterating through the list of `n` elements exactly once. The modulo operation is constant time `O(1)`. Thus, the total time complexity is `O(n)`.
  
### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**: In the worst-case scenario, all indices could satisfy the condition and be stored in the `result` list, leading to a space complexity proportional to the input size. However, this is explicitly for the result list and not due to any auxiliary data structures.
