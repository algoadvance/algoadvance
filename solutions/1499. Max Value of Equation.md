title:  Max Value of Equation-out
permalink: /s1499

You are given an array `points` containing `n` points in the form of (x_i, y_i) and an integer `k`. The value of the equation is defined as `y_i + y_j + |x_i - x_j|` where `|x_i - x_j| ≤ k` and `i < j`. Your task is to find the maximum value of this equation.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the `x_i` values always sorted in ascending order?**
   - Yes, you can assume that.
2. **What are the constraints on the values in `points` and `k`?**
   - Typically, you can assume reasonable ranges such as `1 <= n <= 10^5` and `|x_i|, |y_i|, k ≤ 10^8`.
3. **Can points contain duplicate x values?**
   - No, duplicate x values are typically not included in the problem.

### Strategy
Given the constraints, a brute force approach would be too slow, so we look for an optimized solution using a monotonic queue.

We need to maximize the value:
\[ y_i + y_j + |x_i - x_j| \]

Given that \( x_i \le x_j \) and \( |x_i - x_j| \le k \), this means:
\[ y_i + y_j + x_j - x_i \]

Let's rearrange to isolate parts of the equation:
\[ y_j + y_i + (x_j - x_i) = (y_i - x_i) + (y_j + x_j) \]

To maximize this, we need to maximize \( (y_i - x_i) \) from the past points such that \( |x_i - x_j| \le k \).

We'll maintain a deque to keep track of the maximum values of \( (y_i - x_i) \) while iterating over the points.

### Code
```python
from collections import deque

def findMaxValueOfEquation(points, k):
    # Deque will store tuples of (x_i, y_i - x_i)
    dq = deque()
    max_value = float('-inf')
    
    for x_j, y_j in points:
        # Remove points from deque where x_j - x_i > k
        while dq and x_j - dq[0][0] > k:
            dq.popleft()
        
        # If deque is not empty, calculate the potential max value
        if dq:
            max_value = max(max_value, y_j + x_j + dq[0][1])
        
        # Maintain elements in the deque in a way such that the value of y_i - x_i is maximized at the front
        while dq and dq[-1][1] <= y_j - x_j:
            dq.pop()
        
        # Add new point into deque
        dq.append((x_j, y_j - x_j))
    
    return max_value
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of points. This is because each point is pushed and popped from the deque at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case, where all points are kept in the deque.

### Explanation
- We iterate over each point in the list.
- For each point, we first ensure that our deque only contains points within the distance `k` by popping from the front if necessary.
- We then calculate the potential maximum value using the values in the deque.
- We maintain the deque to ensure it always contains the maximum \( (y_i - x_i) \) at the front.
- Finally, we append the current point's value to the deque and continue.

This algorithm ensures we efficiently find the maximum value without needing a brute force approach, vastly improving the running time for large input sizes.
