title:  Find All Good Strings-out
permalink: /s1397
---

You are given two strings `s1` and `s2`, and one string `evil`. Strings `s1` and `s2` represent the inclusive range of the good strings. You have to find all the good strings that lie in this range and do not contain the substring `evil`.

Given `n` is the size of the strings, return the count of all good strings modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the strings `s1` and `s2` guaranteed to be of the same length?**
   - Yes, the problem states that they represent the inclusive range of good strings of the same length.
   
2. **What are the constraints on the length of `s1` and `s2`?**
   - The length of `s1` and `s2` will be up to 500.

3. **What are the constraints on the substring `evil`?**
   - The length of `evil` can be up to 50.

4. **Are we considering case sensitivity?**
   - Yes, we are considering case sensitivity.

Okay, let's move to the solution.

### Strategy

This problem is significantly complex due to the range of strings and the need to avoid a substring (`evil`). A dynamic programming approach combined with the digit by digit comparison of the range `[s1, s2]` would be efficient.

#### Steps to solve this:

1. **Dynamic Programming State Definition:**
   - Define `dp[pos][prefixSmaller][prefixLarger][matched]` where:
     - `pos` is the current position in the string being constructed.
     - `prefixSmaller` indicates if the current prefix is already smaller than `s2`.
     - `prefixLarger` indicates if the current prefix is already larger than `s1`.
     - `matched` is the number of characters of `evil` matched so far.

2. **Transitions:**
   - Iterate over possible characters and update the states based on the comparison with `s1`, `s2`, and the matching state of `evil`.

3. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - Handle cases when the current prefix satisfies the range limits and when it potentially ends prematurely if it matches `evil`.

4. **Base Case:**
   - When the full length of the strings has been processed, return 1 if no invalid condition is met.

#### Pseudo code:
- Initialize the DP table with -1 (indicating uncomputed states).
- Define a recursive function to fill the DP table.
- The recursion function should handle every position and maintain states for `prefixSmaller`, `prefixLarger`, and `matched`.

```python
def findGoodStrings(n: int, s1: str, s2: str, evil: str) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7

    # Lengths
    len_evil = len(evil)

    # Preprocess KMP "partial match" table for the evil string
    kmp = [0] * len_evil
    j = 0
    for i in range(1, len_evil):
        while j > 0 and evil[i] != evil[j]:
            j = kmp[j - 1]
        if evil[i] == evil[j]:
            j += 1
        kmp[i] = j

    # DP memoization table
    dp = {}

    # Recursive DP function
    def dfs(pos, prefixSmaller, prefixLarger, matched):
        if matched == len_evil:
            return 0  # Invalid as we matched the evil string
        if pos == n:
            return 1  # Valid string
        
        # Memoization check
        if (pos, prefixSmaller, prefixLarger, matched) in dp:
            return dp[(pos, prefixSmaller, prefixLarger, matched)]

        # Calculate limit range for this position
        low = 'a' if prefixLarger else s1[pos]
        high = 'z' if prefixSmaller else s2[pos]

        res = 0

        for char in range(ord(low), ord(high) + 1):
            char = chr(char)

            nextPrefixSmaller = prefixSmaller or (char < high)
            nextPrefixLarger = prefixLarger or (char > low)

            # Update the KMP matching length for the new character
            nextMatched = matched
            while nextMatched > 0 and char != evil[nextMatched]:
                nextMatched = kmp[nextMatched - 1]
            if char == evil[nextMatched]:
                nextMatched += 1

            res += dfs(pos + 1, nextPrefixSmaller, nextPrefixLarger, nextMatched)
            res %= MOD

        dp[(pos, prefixSmaller, prefixLarger, matched)] = res
        return res

    # Initial call
    return dfs(0, False, False, 0)

# Setting the function up
print(findGoodStrings(4, "abcd", "bcda", "bc"))  # Example use case
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N × 26 × 26 × len(evil)) where `N` is the length of `s1` (and `s2`) and 26 for all lowercase English letters and potential states for `prefixSmaller` and `prefixLarger`.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N × 2 × 2 × len(evil)) due to the memoization table.
