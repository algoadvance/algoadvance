title:  Critical Connections in a Network-out
permalink: /s1192
---

You are given an undirected network of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You are also given a list of `connections`, where `connections[i] = [a, b]` represents a connection between nodes `a` and `b`. Any two nodes can be connected by at most one connection, and no node has a connection to itself.

A **critical connection** is a connection that, if removed, will make some nodes unable to reach some other nodes.

Return all critical connections in the network in any order.

### Example:
- **Input**:
  ```
  n = 4
  connections = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]]
  ```
- **Output**:
  ```
  [[1,3]]
  ```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on `n` and the length of `connections`?**
   - `n` will be in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
   - The number of connections will be in the range `[n-1, 10^5]`.

2. **Can there be duplicate connections in the input?**
   - No, there will be no duplicate connections.

3. **Can there be a connection of a node to itself?**
   - No, nodes do not connect to themselves.

## Strategy

To solve the problem of finding critical connections, we can use **Tarjan's Algorithm for finding bridges in a graph**. 

Tarjan's algorithm uses Depth-First Search (DFS) to keep track of discovery and low times of each node. Here is an outline of the strategy:

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the graph.

2. **DFS Traversal**:
   - During DFS, we maintain two arrays:
     - `disc`: Discovery times of visited vertices.
     - `low`: Earliest visited vertex (lowest discovery time) reachable from the subtree rooted with the vertex.
   - A connection between nodes `u` and `v` is a bridge if there is no path between them that does not pass through the connection itself.

3. **Time Management**:
   - Use a timer to set discovery times of the nodes and update accordingly.

## Code

Here is the implementation of the solution in Python:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def criticalConnections(n, connections):
    def dfs(node, parent, discovery_time, low_link, graph, result, timer):
        discovery_time[node] = low_link[node] = timer[0]
        timer[0] += 1
        
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if discovery_time[neighbor] == -1:  # If neighbor is not visited
                dfs(neighbor, node, discovery_time, low_link, graph, result, timer)
                
                # Check if the subtree rooted with neighbor has a connection back to one of ancestors of node
                low_link[node] = min(low_link[node], low_link[neighbor])
                
                # If the lowest vertex reachable from the subtree under neighbor is below node's discovery time, it's a bridge
                if low_link[neighbor] > discovery_time[node]:
                    result.append([node, neighbor])
            elif neighbor != parent:  # Update low_link value of node for parent function calls.
                low_link[node] = min(low_link[node], discovery_time[neighbor])
    
    # Initialize graph
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in connections:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)
    
    # Initialize discovery time and low link arrays
    discovery_time = [-1] * n
    low_link = [-1] * n
    timer = [0]
    result = []
    
    # Start DFS from node 0 (assuming 0 is always part of the graph)
    dfs(0, -1, discovery_time, low_link, graph, result, timer)
    
    return result

# Example usage:
n = 4
connections = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]]
print(criticalConnections(n, connections))
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E), where `V` is the number of vertices (nodes) and `E` is the number of edges (connections). This is because each node and edge is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V + E) for storing the graph in an adjacency list, and additional space for the discovery and low arrays.

This approach ensures efficient computation even for large graphs, within the constraints provided.
