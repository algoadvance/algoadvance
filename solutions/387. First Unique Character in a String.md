title:  First Unique Character in a String-out
permalink: /s387
---
Given a string `s`, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index. If it does not exist, return `-1`.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "leetcode"
Output: 0
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "loveleetcode"
Output: 2
```

Example 3:
```
Input: s = "aabb"
Output: -1
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the string be empty?
   - Yes, if the string is empty, return `-1`.
   
2. Can there be uppercase and lowercase letters in the string?
   - Assume that the string consists of only lowercase English letters.

3. What is the maximum length of the input string?
   - The length of the string can go up to `10^5`.

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we can:
1. Use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each character in the string.
2. Iterate through the string a second time to find the first character that has a count of `1` in the dictionary.

### Code
```python
def firstUniqChar(s: str) -> int:
    # Step 1: Count the occurrences of each character
    char_count = {}
    for char in s:
        if char in char_count:
            char_count[char] += 1
        else:
            char_count[char] = 1
    
    # Step 2: Find the index of the first unique character
    for index, char in enumerate(s):
        if char_count[char] == 1:
            return index
    
    # Return -1 if there is no unique character
    return -1

# Test cases
print(firstUniqChar("leetcode"))      # Output: 0
print(firstUniqChar("loveleetcode"))  # Output: 2
print(firstUniqChar("aabb"))          # Output: -1
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Step 1 (Count characters)**: This takes O(n) time where `n` is the length of the string.
2. **Step 2 (Find first unique character)**: This also takes O(n) time.
   
Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**. The space complexity is also **O(n)** due to the dictionary used to store character counts.

This approach ensures we find the first unique character efficiently even for large input sizes up to the order of \(10^5\).
