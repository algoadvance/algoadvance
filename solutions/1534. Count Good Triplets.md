## Problem Description

Given an array of integers `arr` and three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, find the number of good triplets.

A triplet `(arr[i], arr[j], arr[k])` is good if it satisfies the following conditions:

- `0 <= i < j < k < arr.length`
- `|arr[i] - arr[j]| <= a`
- `|arr[j] - arr[k]| <= b`
- `|arr[i] - arr[k]| <= c`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the input size constrained?**
   - Yes, we should assume the constraints based on typical coding challenges.

2. **Can there be any negative numbers in the array?**
   - Yes, in general integer arrays can have negative numbers.

3. **What is the range of `a`, `b`, and `c`?**
   - They are typical integer values as part of the problem.

## Strategy

We need to iterate over all possible triplets `(i, j, k)` in the array and check if they satisfy the given conditions. A brute force approach involves nested loops to examine all triplets. 

### Steps:
1. Use three nested loops to iterate over all triplets.
2. For each triplet, check if it satisfies the conditions.
3. Count the triplets that satisfy all conditions.

## Time Complexity

The brute force method works in `O(n^3)` time complexity because we are using three nested loops to iterate over the array elements. Given the constraints are typically low (for example, `arr.length <= 100`), this complexity is acceptable for this problem.

## Code

Here's the implementation of the described strategy:

```python
def count_good_triplets(arr, a, b, c):
    count = 0
    n = len(arr)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            for k in range(j + 1, n):
                if abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) <= a and abs(arr[j] - arr[k]) <= b and abs(arr[i] - arr[k]) <= c:
                    count += 1
    return count

# Example usage
arr = [3,0,1,1,9,7]
a = 7
b = 2
c = 3
print(count_good_triplets(arr, a, b, c))  # Output: 4
```

### Conclusion

This solution iterates through each triplet and checks the conditions directly, guaranteeing that all potential triplets are examined. While the time complexity is `O(n^3)`, it is adequate for the typical constraints of such problems. If larger constraints exist, optimization techniques or different algorithms would be required.
