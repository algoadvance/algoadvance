title:  Partition String Into Minimum Beautiful Substrings-out
permalink: /s2767
---

You are given a `string` `s`, and you are to partition the string into the minimum number of beautiful substrings. A beautiful substring is defined as a substring that represents a number and indicates whether this number is a power of 5. The numbers that are powers of 5 in order are `1, 5, 25, 125, 625, 3125, ...`.

Return the minimum number of beautiful substrings you can partition the string into. If it is impossible to divide the entire string into beautiful substrings, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What constitutes a valid beautiful substring?**
   - A beautiful substring when converted into an integer should be a power of 5.

2. **What characters does the string contain?**
   - The string `s` contains only the digits '0' and '1'.

3. **Are there any constraints on the length of the string?**
   - There are no specific limits mentioned, but let's assume the length could be relatively large for a coding interview setting (e.g., up to 10^5).

4. **Should leading zeros in a substring be considered?**
   - Leading zeros should be avoided unless the substring is "0".

### Strategy

1. **Identify the Problem Context:**
   - We need to find all possible partitions of `s` where each partitioned piece is a power of 5.

2. **Identify all powers of 5 that are represented as binary strings that fit within the string's length.**
   - Precompute powers of 5 up to a reasonable limit (until the binary string length exceeds the length of `s`).

3. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach:**
   - Use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of beautiful substrings to partition `s[0:i + 1]`.
   - Iterate over each possible substring ending at position `i`, check if it is a power of 5, and update the DP table.

### Code

```python
def min_beautiful_substrings(s: str) -> int:
    # Convert pre-calculated powers of 5 into binary strings and store them
    powers_of_five = []
    num = 1
    while True:
        bin_representation = bin(num)[2:]
        if len(bin_representation) > len(s):
            break
        powers_of_five.append(bin_representation)
        num *= 5
    
    n = len(s)
    dp = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for power in powers_of_five:
            power_len = len(power)
            if i >= power_len and s[i - power_len:i] == power:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - power_len] + 1)

    return dp[n] if dp[n] != float('inf') else -1

# Examples and test cases
print(min_beautiful_substrings("101101101"))  # Output example: Expected result based on the problem description
print(min_beautiful_substrings("111"))        # Output example: Expected result based on the problem description
print(min_beautiful_substrings("0"))          # Output example: Expected result based on the problem description
```

### Time Complexity

- **Precomputation Step:** Generation of binary representations of powers of 5 is done until the length exceeds that of `s`. This step is relatively efficient.
- **Dynamic Programming Step:** For each index `i` in the string, we check against all possible beautiful substrings (powers of 5), making the complexity `O(n * k)` where `n` is the length of the string and `k` is the number of precomputed binary representations of powers of 5.

In summary, the overall time complexity would approximately be `O(n * k)`. Given the constraints, this approach should be efficient enough for practical purposes.
