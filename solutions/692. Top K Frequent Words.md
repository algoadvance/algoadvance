title:  Top K Frequent Words-out
permalink: /s692
---

Given an array of strings `words` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent strings. Return the answer sorted by frequency from highest to lowest. Sort the words with the same frequency by their lexicographical order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size Constraints**:
   - What is the maximum length of the array `words`?
   - What is the length limit for each string in `words`?

2. **Output Specifics**:
   - Should the output be in a specific format (e.g., list, array)?
   - How to handle ties in frequency?

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Are there any special characters in the strings?
   - Can `k` be larger than the number of unique strings in `words`?

### Strategy

1. **Frequency Count**:
   - Use a dictionary to count the frequency of each word in the input list `words`.

2. **Sorting**:
   - Use a heap to keep track of the top `k` elements based on frequency. For words with the same frequency, use lexicographical order to prioritize.

3. **Heap Data Structure**:
   - Use a min-heap for maintaining the top `k` elements since it allows for efficient insertion and removal.

4. **Final Output**:
   - Extract elements from the heap and sort them to get the correct order (since min-heap gives the smallest elements first).

### Time Complexity

1. **Frequency Count**: O(N), where N is the number of words in the input list.
2. **Heap Operations**: O(M log K), where M is the number of unique words and K is the size of the heap.
3. **Sorting the Result**: O(K log K) since we need to sort at the final stage.

The overall time complexity is approximately O(N + M log K + K log K).

### Code

```python
from typing import List
from collections import Counter
import heapq

def topKFrequent(words: List[str], k: int) -> List[str]:
    # Step 1: Count the frequency of each word
    freq = Counter(words)
    
    # Step 2: Use a heap to find the k most frequent words
    heap = []
    for word, count in freq.items():
        # Python's heapq module creates a min-heap, we use negative count to get max-heap behavior
        heapq.heappush(heap, (-count, word))
    
    # Step 3: Extract the top k frequent words from the heap
    result = []
    for _ in range(k):
        result.append(heapq.heappop(heap)[1])
    
    return result

# Example usage:
words = ["i", "love", "leetcode", "i", "love", "coding"]
k = 2
print(topKFrequent(words, k))  # Output: ["i", "love"]
```

This code will provide the `k` most frequent words in the correct order, while handling ties by lexicographical sorting. 

### Additional Comments

- Ensure valid inputs: The function assumes `k` will always be valid, i.e., not greater than the number of unique words in the list. If `k` can potentially be larger, additional checks may be needed.
- Consider special scenarios (e.g., empty input list) and handle them appropriately.
