title:  Find the Count of Monotonic Pairs I-out
permalink: /s3250
---

Given an array `nums`, your task is to count how many pairs `(i, j)` exist where `0 <= i < j < len(nums)` and `nums[i] <= nums[j]`. Essentially, you are to count the number of monotonic (non-decreasing) pairs in the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Clarification on input size**: What is the constraint on the size of the array `nums`?
   - This helps in understanding the best strategy to use.
   
2. **Content of inputs**: Are there any constraints on the values of the integers in `nums`?
   - This ensures the input values are within a reasonable range to avoid overflow or other issues.

3. **Edge cases**: Do we need to consider arrays of size 0 or 1?
   - Handling these edge cases can avoid unnecessary errors or miscounts.

### Strategy

1. **Brute Force Approach**:
   - A straightforward method is to iterate through each pair `(i, j)` where `i < j` and count if `nums[i] <= nums[j]`. 
   - This approach is simple but can be slow for large arrays since it has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\).

2. **Optimized Approach**:
   - We can use an auxiliary data structure or sorting technique to improve the count process and reduce time complexity.

Given lack of specific range constraints, we will adopt the brute force approach for simplicity unless stated otherwise.

### Code

```python
def countMonotonicPairs(nums):
    count = 0
    n = len(nums)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if nums[i] <= nums[j]:
                count += 1
    return count

# Test the function with a sample input
nums = [1, 3, 2, 4]
print(countMonotonicPairs(nums))  # Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this brute force approach is \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array. This is because we are using two nested loops to check each pair.

### Optimized Version Using Binary Indexed Tree (Optional for Larger Inputs)

To bring down the time complexity for larger inputs, we can use a Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or Fenwick Tree. However, the implementation complexity increases, requiring additional knowledge of such data structures.

This basic version should suffice most typical scenarios unless larger constraints are provided.
