title:  Cells with Odd Values in a Matrix-out
permalink: /s1252
---

You are given `m` and `n` which represent the number of rows and columns in a matrix initialized with all `0`s and a list `indices` where `indices[i] = [ri, ci]` represents incrementing the `i-th` row (`ri`) and column (`ci`) by 1. Your task is to return the number of cells with odd values in the matrix after applying all the increments to the `indices`.

### Example
```python
Input: m = 2, n = 3, indices = [[0,1],[1,1]]
Output: 6

Input: m = 2, n = 2, indices = [[1,1],[0,0]]
Output: 0
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can we assume that `m` and `n` will always be positive integers? 
2. Will `indices` always have valid rows and columns within the bounds of `m` and `n`?
3. Are there constraints on the size of `m`, `n`, and the length of `indices`?

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Create a matrix of size `m x n` initialized to `0`.
2. **Increment Rows and Columns**: For each pair `[ri, ci]` in `indices`, increment all elements of row `ri` and all elements of column `ci`.
3. **Count Odd Cells**: Iterate through the matrix and count cells with odd values.

## Time Complexity
- The overall complexity will be O(m * n + k * (m + n)), where `k` is the length of `indices`. In each of the `k` operations, incrementing rows and columns will take `O(m + n)` time, and we need to visit each cell once to count the odd values.

## Code

```python
def oddCells(m, n, indices):
    # Step 1: Initialize the m x n matrix with zeros
    matrix = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    
    # Step 2: Apply the increments
    for r, c in indices:
        # Increment the entire row r
        for j in range(n):
            matrix[r][j] += 1
        # Increment the entire column c
        for i in range(m):
            matrix[i][c] += 1
    
    # Step 3: Count the odd values in the matrix
    odd_count = 0
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if matrix[i][j] % 2 != 0:
                odd_count += 1
    
    return odd_count

# Example usage
print(oddCells(2, 3, [[0, 1], [1, 1]])) # Output: 6
print(oddCells(2, 2, [[1, 1], [0, 0]])) # Output: 0
```

This code follows the strategy of incrementing rows and columns based on the indices, then counting the number of odd-valued cells in the matrix. Each increment operation may touch multiple elements, leading to a time complexity that scales with the matrix size and the number of indices.
