title:  Minimum Deletions to Make Array Divisible-out
permalink: /s2344
---

You are given two arrays `nums` and `numsDivide`. You can delete any number of elements from `nums` to make the smallest element in `nums` divisible by all elements in `numsDivide`. Find the minimum number of deletions required. If it is not possible, return -1.

Example:
- Input: `nums = [3, 7, 9, 12]`, `numsDivide = [3, 6, 9]`
- Output: 1
- Explanation: You can delete 7 from `nums` to make the smallest element 3, which is divisible by elements in `numsDivide`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the array `nums` contain duplicate values?
   - Yes, duplicates can be present.
   
2. Is there a specific size constraint for `nums` and `numsDivide`?
   - Typically, no specific constraint unless stated explicitly in the problem; you should assume average constraints similar to other LeetCode problems.

3. Can both arrays contain negative numbers or zero?
   - Based on typical constraints for such types of problems, both arrays likely contain positive integers only.

### Strategy

1. **Calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**:
   - Compute the GCD of all elements in `numsDivide`. This value, `gcd_num_divide`, represents the value that any candidate number from `nums` must be divisible by to satisfy the problem requirements.

2. **Sort `nums`**:
   - Sort the `nums` array to consider the smallest elements first which reduces the number of deletions necessary.

3. **Find the Minimum Deletions**:
   - Iterate through the sorted `nums` array and find the first element that is divisible by `gcd_num_divide`. Count the number of deletions required to reach this element.

4. **Return the Count**:
   - Return the number of deletions needed. If no such element is found, return -1.

### Time Complexity

- Calculating the GCD for `numsDivide` will take O(N) where N is the length of `numsDivide`.
- Sorting `nums` will take O(M log M) where M is the length of `nums`.
- Iterating through `nums` to find the element takes O(M), making the overall time complexity O(N + M log M).

### Code

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def min_deletions_to_make_array_divisible(nums, numsDivide):
    # Calculate the GCD of the entire numsDivide array
    gcd_num_divide = reduce(gcd, numsDivide)
    
    # Sort the nums array
    nums.sort()
    
    # Find the minimum deletions required
    deletions = 0
    for num in nums:
        if gcd_num_divide % num == 0:
            return deletions
        deletions += 1
    
    # If no valid element is found that can be divisible by gcd_num_divide
    return -1

# Example usage
nums = [3, 7, 9, 12]
numsDivide = [3, 6, 9]
print(min_deletions_to_make_array_divisible(nums, numsDivide))  # Output: 1
```
