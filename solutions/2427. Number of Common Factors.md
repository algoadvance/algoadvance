Leetcode Problem 2427: **Number of Common Factors**

Given two positive integers `a` and `b`, return the number of common factors of `a` and `b`.

A factor of an integer `n` is defined as a positive integer `i` such that `n % i == 0`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Input Values**: What is the range of the integers `a` and `b`?
   - If the values can be large, this could impact the choice of the algorithm.

2. **Type of Integers**: Are `a` and `b` guaranteed to be positive?
   - The problem specifies they are positive integers, so no need to handle zero or negative cases.

### Strategy

1. **Find the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**: 
    - The number of common factors of `a` and `b` is the same as the number of factors of `gcd(a, b)`. This simplifies the problem significantly, as finding the factors of a smaller number (the GCD) is easier.

2. **Finding All Factors of a Number**:
    - Iterate through potential factors up to and including the square root of the GCD. If `i` is a factor, then `gcd(a, b) / i` is also a factor.

3. **Return the Count of Factors**:
    - Count the factors found and return this count as the answer.

### Time Complexity

- Finding the GCD can be done in `O(log(min(a, b)))` time using the Euclidean algorithm.
- Finding the factors of a number `n` involves iterating up to `sqrt(n)`, which is `O(sqrt(n))`.

Overall, the time complexity should be efficient for large inputs.

### Code

```python
import math
  
def common_factors(a: int, b: int) -> int:
    def gcd(x, y):
        while y:
            x, y = y, x % y
        return x
    
    def count_factors(n):
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
            if n % i == 0:
                count += 1
                if i != n // i:
                    count += 1
        return count

    gcd_value = gcd(a, b)
    return count_factors(gcd_value)

# Example usage
print(common_factors(12, 15))  # Output: 2, because common factors are 1 and 3
print(common_factors(100, 10)) # Output: 4, because common factors are 1, 2, 5, and 10
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **GCD Calculation**: 
    - We define a helper function `gcd` to compute the greatest common divisor of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.

2. **Counting Factors**:
    - We define another helper function `count_factors` to count all the factors of a given integer n by iterating up to the square root of n and checking if each integer is a factor.

3. **Main Function**:
    - Calculate the gcd of `a` and `b`.
    - Use `count_factors` to count the number of factors of the gcd.
    - Return the count as the result.

This solution efficiently combines GCD computation with factor counting for an optimal approach.
