title:  Champagne Tower-out
permalink: /s799
---

We are given a champagne tower with an infinite number of rows, where the first row has 1 glass, the second row has 2 glasses, the third row has 3 glasses, and so on. We pour `poured` amount of champagne into the top glass. When a glass becomes full (it cannot hold more than 1 unit of champagne), the excess champagne spills equally to the two glasses immediately below it. 

We need to find how much champagne is in the glass located at the `query_row` and `query_glass`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of `poured`, `query_row`, and `query_glass`?**
    - Generally, these are within reasonable bounds as per typical competitive programming constraints, usually `poured` can be up to 10^9, and `query_row`, `query_glass` up to 99 or similar.

2. **Will there always be enough champagne to reach the given `query_row` and `query_glass`?**
    - It is possible that not enough champagne is there to reach the row. If so, we'll simply return 0.

3. **What is the expected output if the glass is spilled but not full?**
    - The output should be the specific amount in that glass, which could be less than 1.

## Strategy

1. Use a list to simulate the glasses in the tower. Each entry in the list will represent a glass on a specific row.
2. Start by initializing the first glass with the number of `poured` champagne.
3. Iterate through each row, cascading the excess champagne to the glasses in the next row.
4. Stop when we reach the `query_row`.
5. The final value in the `query_glass` will be the minimum of 1 and the amount (since a glass can't have more than 1 unit of champagne).

We simulate the pouring process until we reach the desired row and glass position.

## Code

```python
def champagneTower(poured: int, query_row: int, query_glass: int) -> float:
    # Initialize the first element with the poured champagne
    towers = [[0] * (r + 1) for r in range(query_row + 1)]
    towers[0][0] = poured
    
    for r in range(query_row):
        for c in range(r + 1):
            overflow = (towers[r][c] - 1.0) / 2.0
            if overflow > 0:
                towers[r + 1][c] += overflow
                towers[r + 1][c + 1] += overflow
    
    return min(1, towers[query_row][query_glass])

# Example usage:
poured = 25
query_row = 6
query_glass = 1
print(champagneTower(poured, query_row, query_glass))  # Expected output depends on the simulation
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization of data structure:** \(O(R^2)\), where \(R\) is the `query_row`.
- **Simulation of the pouring process:** \(O(R^2)\), updating each glass once.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(R^2)\), which is efficient for input constraints typical of this problem (e.g., \(R \leq 99\)).
