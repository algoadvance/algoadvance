title:  Custom Sort String-out
permalink: /s791
---

You are given two strings `order` and `s`. All the characters of `order` are unique and were sorted in some custom order previously. 
Permute the characters of `s` so that they match the order that `order` was sorted. More specifically, if a character `x` occurs before a character `y` in `order`, then `x` should occur before `y` in the returned string.

Return any permutation of `s` that satisfies this property.

**Example:**
```
Input:
order = "cba"
s = "abcd"
Output:
"cbad"

Explanation:
"a", "b", "c" were sorted in the original order. So "cba" should appear in the returned string. As "d" doesn't exist in order, it can be at any position in the returned string.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the input always valid?**
   - Yes, you can assume the input strings `order` and `s` are non-empty and `order` contains only unique characters.

2. **How should characters in `s` that do not appear in `order` be handled?**
   - Characters not in `order` can appear in any position relative to the characters specified in `order`, as they have no specified order.

3. **Can `order` contain characters not present in `s`?**
   - Yes, `order` may contain characters that do not appear in `s`.

4. **What should be done in case of an empty `order` string?**
   - This situation won't occur because per the assumption, the input strings `order` and `s` are non-empty.

## Strategy

1. **Create a frequency Counter for characters in `s`.** This will help to keep track of the number of occurrences of each character.
2. **Build the result string using the `order` string.** For each character in `order`, append it to the result as many times as it appears in `s` using the Counter created in step 1.
3. **Append remaining characters that were not in `order`.** After processing all characters in `order`, append any characters in `s` that do not appear in `order`.

## Code

```python
from collections import Counter

def customSortString(order: str, s: str) -> str:
    # Step 1: Create a frequency counter for characters in s
    count = Counter(s)
    
    # Step 2: Build the result string using the `order` string
    result = []
    for char in order:
        if char in count:
            result.append(char * count[char])
            del count[char]  # remove the character completely
    
    # Step 3: Append remaining characters that were not in `order`
    for char, freq in count.items():
        result.append(char * freq)
    
    # Join the result list to form the final string
    return ''.join(result)

# Example usage
order = "cba"
s = "abcd"
print(customSortString(order, s))  # Output: "cbad"
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Counting frequencies:** Constructing the frequency counter for `s` takes `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of `s`.
2. **Building the result string:** Iterating through the `order` string and constructing the result substring for each character present in `order` takes `O(m * freq)` where `m` is the length of `order` and `freq` is the average frequency of characters in `s`. Since `freq` can be considered as a constant, this step effectively takes `O(m)`.
3. **Appending remaining characters:** Iterating through characters not in `order` and appending them to the result string takes `O(n - m)`, where `n - m` is the count of characters not in `order`.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the solution is `O(n + m)` where `n` is the length of `s` and `m` is the length of `order`.
