title:  Minimum Number of K Consecutive Bit Flips-out
permalink: /s995
---

The problem asks for the minimum number of K consecutive bit flips required to have all bits in the array equal to 1. 

You are given a binary array `A` and an integer `K`.

In a K consecutive bit flip, you flip K consecutive bits of the array. That is to say, if `A[i]` is 0 it becomes 1, and if `A[i]` is 1 it becomes 0.

Return the minimum number of K-bit flips required so that each bit in the array is 1. If it's not possible, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if the entire initial array is already all ones?**
   - Return 0, as no flips are needed.
  
2. **Can the input array be empty?**
   - No, assume the array will always contain at least one element.

3. **What are the ranges for the length of the array `A` and the value of `K`?**
   - The length of the array `A` can range from 1 to 10^5 and `K` can also range from 1 to the length of `A`.

### Strategy

1. Use a sliding window technique where we maintain the range of flipped bits using an auxiliary array `flip`. 
2. Traverse through the array and determine if flipping should start.
3. Maintain a `flips` count to keep track of the total number of flips performed.
4. If ending flips exceed the bounds of the array, it's not possible to flip K consecutive bits.

### Code

```python
def minKBitFlips(A, K):
    n = len(A)
    flip = [0] * n
    flipped = 0
    result = 0

    for i in range(n):
        if i >= K:
            flipped ^= flip[i - K]
        
        if A[i] == flipped:
            if i + K > n:
                return -1
            
            flip[i] = 1
            flipped ^= 1
            result += 1

    return result

# Example Usage
A = [0,1,0]
K = 1
print(minKBitFlips(A, K))  # Output: 2

A = [1,1,0]
K = 2
print(minKBitFlips(A, K))  # Output: -1
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the array `A`, and we only go through the array once while maintaining an auxiliary array of the same length. This ensures that we can handle even the largest input sizes efficiently within the constraints provided. 

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is **O(n)** due to the auxiliary array `flip` which tracks the flips applied along the array. This can potentially be optimized but is necessary for ensuring the correctness of the solution under the given constraint conditions.
