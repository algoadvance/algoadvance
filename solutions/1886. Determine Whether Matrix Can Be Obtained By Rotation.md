title:  Determine Whether Matrix Can Be Obtained By Rotation-out
permalink: /s1886
---

You are given two `n x n` binary matrices `mat` and `target`. You are allowed to rotate `mat` 90 degrees clockwise any number of times. Return `true` if it is possible to make `mat` equal to `target`, or `false` otherwise.

Example 1:
```
Input: mat = [[0,1],[1,0]], target = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: true
Explanation: We can rotate mat 90 degrees clockwise to make mat equal to target.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: mat = [[0,1],[1,1]], target = [[1,0],[0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: It is impossible to rotate mat to make it equal to target.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the dimensionality of the matrices? 
   - The matrices are n x n, and they are square matrices.

2. Are the elements of the matrices only binary (0s and 1s)?
   - Yes, the matrices contain only binary values.

3. What are the constraints on n (the size of the matrices)?
   - The constraints allow for a reasonable range, suitable for iterative rotations.

### Strategy

1. The core idea is to rotate the matrix 90 degrees clockwise up to 3 times (90, 180, 270 degrees) and check if any of the rotated matrices match the `target` matrix.
2. Define a helper function to perform the 90-degree rotation on the matrix.
3. Compare the resulting matrix from each rotation to the `target` matrix.
4. If any rotation matches the `target` matrix, return `true`. If none match, return `false`.

### Code
```python
def rotate_90(mat):
    n = len(mat)
    rotated = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            rotated[j][n - i - 1] = mat[i][j]
    return rotated

def findRotation(mat, target):
    # We will rotate mat 4 times (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees)
    for _ in range(4):
        if mat == target:
            return True
        mat = rotate_90(mat)
    return False

# Example usage
mat = [[0,1],[1,0]]
target = [[1,0],[0,1]]
print(findRotation(mat, target))  # Output: True

mat = [[0,1],[1,1]]
target = [[1,0],[0,1]]
print(findRotation(mat, target))  # Output: False
```

### Time Complexity

- **Rotation Complexity:** Each rotation is `O(n^2)` since we need to rearrange elements in an `n x n` matrix.
- **Comparison Complexity:** Each comparison is `O(n^2)`.
  
Since we perform up to 4 rotations and compare each resulting matrix:
- **Overall Time Complexity:** `O(4 * n^2)`, which simplifies to `O(n^2)`.

This solution is efficient for the given problem constraints.
