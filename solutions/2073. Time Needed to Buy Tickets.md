title:  Time Needed to Buy Tickets-out
permalink: /s2073
---

You have a queue of customers at a ticket counter represented by an array `tickets`, where `tickets[i]` is the number of tickets that the `i-th` customer wants to buy. Each customer can buy only one ticket at a time, and they must wait until the current transaction is complete before proceeding to the next customer in a circular fashion from the start of the queue.

Return the number of seconds needed to complete the ticket buying process for the customer located at position `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the number of tickets each customer can buy restricted to positive integers?**
   - Yes, each customer can buy a positive integer number of tickets.

2. **Does the queue form a strictly circular pattern, meaning after the last customer the process continues with the first customer again?**
   - Yes, the queue follows a circular pattern. When the last customer has bought a ticket, the process continues with the first customer again.

3. **What are the constraints on the length of the `tickets` array and the values it can contain?**
   - Typical constraints for such problems:
      - `1 <= tickets.length <= 1000`
      - `1 <= tickets[i] <= 1000`
      - `0 <= k < tickets.length`

### Strategy

1. Start the clock at `0` seconds.
2. Simulate the process where each customer in the queue buys one ticket at a time.
3. Use a loop to iterate over the customers circularly:
    - Decrease the ticket count for the current customer by one.
    - Increase the time counter by one.
    - If the customer at position `k` gets their last ticket, stop the process and return the current time.
4. Continue until the `k-th` customer's ticket count reaches 0.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is O(n * m), where `n` is the length of the `tickets` array and `m` is the maximum number of tickets any customer wants to buy. This is because, in the worst case, each customer buys a maximum of `m` tickets, and we check every customer in each iteration.

### Code

```python
def timeRequiredToBuy(tickets, k):
    time = 0
    
    while tickets[k] > 0:
        for i in range(len(tickets)):
            if tickets[i] > 0:  # If the customer still has tickets to buy
                time += 1
                tickets[i] -= 1
            
            if tickets[k] == 0:  # Check if the k-th customer has finished buying
                return time

# Example usage
tickets = [2, 3, 2]
k = 2
print(timeRequiredToBuy(tickets, k))  # Outputs: 6
```

The above code tracks the total time required for the `k-th` customer to buy all of their tickets. Each iteration of the loop simulates one customer buying a single ticket in a circular fashion until the process completes for the `k-th` customer.
