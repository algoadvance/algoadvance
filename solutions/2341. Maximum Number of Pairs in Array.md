title:  Maximum Number of Pairs in Array-out
permalink: /s2341
---

Given a list of integers `nums`, return the total number of pairs in the list and the leftover elements after all the pairs have been removed. A pair is considered as two identical elements from the list. 

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [1,3,2,1,3,2,2]
Output: [3,1]

Input: nums = [1,1]
Output: [1,0]

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0,1]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the elements in the list be negative?
   **A:** Yes, integers in the list can be negative, zero, or positive.
   
2. **Q:** What is the range of the length of the input list?
   **A:** The length of the input list can range from 1 to 10^5.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to count how many times each element appears in the list. We can use a dictionary to keep track of these counts.

1. **Count Frequencies:** Traverse the list and count the occurrences of each element using a dictionary.
2. **Calculate Pairs and Leftovers:** For each unique element, determine how many pairs can be formed (using integer division by 2) and how many elements are leftover (using modulus 2).
3. **Sum Up Pairs and Leftovers:** Aggregate the counts of pairs and leftovers to get the final result.

### Code

```python
def numberOfPairs(nums):
    from collections import Counter
    
    # Count the frequency of each number
    freq = Counter(nums)
    
    # Initialize pairs and leftovers
    pairs = 0
    leftovers = 0
    
    # Calculate pairs and leftovers from the frequency map
    for count in freq.values():
        pairs += count // 2
        leftovers += count % 2
    
    return [pairs, leftovers]

# Test cases
print(numberOfPairs([1, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 2]))  # Output: [3, 1]
print(numberOfPairs([1, 1]))                # Output: [1, 0]
print(numberOfPairs([0]))                   # Output: [0, 1]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Counting Frequencies:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the list.
- **Calculating Pairs and Leftovers:** O(k), where k is the number of unique elements in the list. In the worst case, k = n.

Hence, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, making this solution efficient even for large inputs.

### Space Complexity

- Using a dictionary to store the frequency count involves O(k) space.
- Therefore, the space complexity is **O(n)** in the worst case when all elements are unique.
