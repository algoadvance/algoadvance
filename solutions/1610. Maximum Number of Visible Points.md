title:  Maximum Number of Visible Points-out
permalink: /s1610
---
You are given an array `points`, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the coordinates of a point on a 2D plane. You are also given an integer `angle` and the location of your position `location` = `[x, y]`. 

**Points should be considered visible** if the area of the viewable angle has a value less than or equal to the given `angle` and no obstacles obstruct the view (points at the same location as your position are always visible).

Return the maximum number of points that are visible from your location.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Do all points need to be considered visible, or is it just those within the `angle` and around the `location`?**
   Only the points that fall within the `angle` and around the `location` should be considered.

2. **Can the points overlap, i.e., can multiple points have the same coordinates?**
   Yes, multiple points can have the same coordinates.

3. **What are the constraints on the sizes of the input lists and values?**
   The constraints are typically as follows:
   - `1 <= points.length <= 10^5`
   - `points[i].length == 2`
   - `location.length == 2`
   - `angle` is an integer, and `0 <= angle < 360`
   - The coordinates are within the range of -10^9 to 10^9.

### Strategy
The strategy to solve this problem involves the following steps:
1. **Calculate Angles**: Compute the angles of all points with respect to the location point.
2. **Duplicate Angle Array**: To handle circular angle cases, duplicate the angle array augmented by \(360^\circ\).
3. **Sliding Window**: Use a sliding window technique to count the maximum number of points inside any feasible angle view.

### Code
Let's write the code as per the strategy detailed above.

```python
import math

def visible_points(points, angle, location):
    def calculate_angle(px, py):
        return math.degrees(math.atan2(py - location[1], px - location[0]))
    
    # Store angles of each point relative to the location
    angles = []
    extra = 0
    
    for px, py in points:
        if [px, py] == location:
            extra += 1
        else:
            angles.append(calculate_angle(px, py))
    
    # Sort angles
    angles.sort()
    
    # Duplicate angles array augmented by 360 degrees to handle the wrap-around
    angles = angles + [x + 360 for x in angles]
    
    # Use sliding window to find the maximum number of points
    max_visible = 0
    left = 0
    
    for right in range(len(angles)):
        while angles[right] - angles[left] > angle:
            left += 1
        max_visible = max(max_visible, right - left + 1)
    
    return max_visible + extra

# Example test
points = [[2,1], [2,2], [3,3]]
angle = 90
location = [1,1]
print(visible_points(points, angle, location))  # Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: Calculating angles for each point and then sorting them takes \(O(N \log N)\), where \(N\) is the number of points.
- **Sliding Window**: The sliding window to find the maximum number of visible points runs in \(O(N)\) time.

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(N \log N)\), which is efficient given the constraints of the problem.
