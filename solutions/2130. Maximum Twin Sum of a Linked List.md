title:  Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List-out
permalink: /s2130
---

Given the head of a linked list with an even number of nodes, the nodes represent positive integers. The twin sum of a linked list is defined as the sum of nodes from pairs: one node from the beginning of the list and one node from the end of the list. In other words, for a linked list of length `n`, the twin pairs are `(head[i], head[n-1-i])` for `i` from `0` to `n/2 - 1`. The problem is to determine the maximum twin sum among all these twin pairs.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the possible values for the integer nodes? 
     - Nodes represent positive integers.
   - What is the maximum length for the linked list?
     - Typical constraints for such problems are up to \( 10^4 \) nodes.
   - Is the length of the linked list guaranteed to be even?
     - Yes, the length of the linked list is even.

2. **Output:**
   - Are we returning the maximum twin sum as an integer?
     - Yes.
   
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - How should we handle an empty linked list?
     - Given the problem constraints, we assume the list is always non-empty with an even number of nodes.

### Strategy

1. **Find the Middle of the List:** Use the fast and slow pointer technique to locate the midpoint of the linked list.
2. **Reverse the Second Half:** Reverse the second half of the list starting from the midpoint.
3. **Twin Sum Calculation:** Initialize two pointers from the head of the list and the head of the reversed second half of the list to compute twin sums. Iterate over both halves simultaneously and keep track of the maximum twin sum.

### Code

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def find_middle(head):
    slow = head
    fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
    return slow

def reverse_list(head):
    prev = None
    current = head
    while current:
        next_node = current.next
        current.next = prev
        prev = current
        current = next_node
    return prev

def pairSum(head):
    if not head:
        return 0
    
    # Step 1: Find the middle
    middle = find_middle(head)
    
    # Step 2: Reverse the second half
    second_half = reverse_list(middle)

    # Step 3: Calculate the maximum twin sum
    max_twin_sum = 0
    while second_half:
        max_twin_sum = max(max_twin_sum, head.val + second_half.val)
        head = head.next
        second_half = second_half.next
        
    return max_twin_sum
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Finding the Middle:** O(n) where n is the length of the linked list.
2. **Reversing the Second Half:** O(n/2) which simplifies to O(n).
3. **Calculating the Twin Sum:** O(n/2) which simplifies to O(n).

**Overall Time Complexity:** O(n)

The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of extra space.
