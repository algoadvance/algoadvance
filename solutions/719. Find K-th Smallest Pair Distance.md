title:  Find K-th Smallest Pair Distance-out
permalink: /s719
---
The problem is to find the k-th smallest pair distance in an array. Specifically, given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, we need to return the k-th smallest distance among all the pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` where `0 <= i < j < nums.length`.

### Example
```python
Input: nums = [1, 3, 1], k = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The 1st smallest distance is 0, which is the distance of the pairs (1,1).
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `nums` contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, `nums` can consist of negative numbers, but this does not affect the pair distances since distance calculation involves absolute differences.

2. **What is the range of `nums`?**
   - The size of the `nums` array can vary and let's assume constraints similar to typical LeetCode problems with array size up to 10000 and elements range being typical integer values.

3. **Will `k` always be valid?**
   - Yes, `k` will be such that a valid distance exists for the k-th smallest position.

### Strategy
We will use a combination of binary search and the two-pointer technique to solve the problem efficiently:

1. **Sorting:**
   - We first sort the array to allow binary search over possible distance values.

2. **Binary Search on Distance:**
   - We use binary search to find the smallest distance `dist` such that there are at least `k` pairs with a distance less than or equal to `dist`.

3. **Counting Pairs with Two Pointers:**
   - For a candidate distance `mid` in the binary search, count the number of pairs with distance less than or equal to `mid` using a two-pointer technique. This involves iterating through the array and for each starting element, finding the farthest element that forms a valid pair with the starting element.

### Code
```python
def smallestDistancePair(nums, k):
    nums.sort()
    
    def count_pairs_within(dist):
        count, start = 0, 0
        for end in range(len(nums)):
            while nums[end] - nums[start] > dist:
                start += 1
            count += end - start
        return count
    
    low, high = 0, nums[-1] - nums[0]
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if count_pairs_within(mid) < k:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Sorting:**
   - O(n log n) where `n` is the length of `nums`.

2. **Binary Search:**
   - Logarithmic time complexity, O(log(max_distance)), where `max_distance` is the largest possible distance (`nums[-1] - nums[0]`).

3. **Counting Pairs:**
   - Linear time complexity, O(n) for each binary search step.

The overall time complexity is:
\[ O(n \log n + n \log (\text{max\_distance})) \]
This is efficient enough for typical problem constraints.
