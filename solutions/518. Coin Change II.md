You are given an integer array `coins` representing coins of different denominations and an integer `amount` representing a total amount of money. Return the number of combinations that make up that amount. If that amount of money cannot be made up by any combination of the coins, return `0`.

You may assume that you have an infinite number of each kind of coin.

**Example 1:**
- Input: `amount = 5`, `coins = [1, 2, 5]`
- Output: `4`
- Explanation: There are four ways to make up the amount:
  - `5=5`
  - `5=2+2+1`
  - `5=2+1+1+1`
  - `5=1+1+1+1+1`

**Example 2:**
- Input: `amount = 3`, `coins = [2]`
- Output: `0`
- Explanation: The amount of 3 cannot be made up just with coins of 2.

**Example 3:**
- Input: `amount = 10`, `coins = [10]`
- Output: `1`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the array of coins be empty?**
   - Yes. If `coins` is empty, then the solution should be `0` for any positive `amount`.

2. **Can the amount be `0`?**
   - Yes. If `amount` is `0`, the number of ways to make the amount is `1` (by choosing no coins).

3. **Are negative amounts or coin denominations allowed?**
   - No. Both `amount` and coin denominations are assumed to be non-negative integers.

With the problem statement clear, let's proceed to the next steps.

### Strategy

We can solve this problem using Dynamic Programming. The idea is to use a list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to get the amount `i` using the available coins. 

1. Initialize a list `dp` of size `amount + 1` with all values set to `0`, except `dp[0]` which should be `1` (since there's one way to make amount `0`: using no coins).
2. For each coin in the list `coins`, update the `dp` list for all amounts that can include this coin from `coin` to `amount`.

The final answer will be in `dp[amount]`.

### Code

```python
def change(amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
    # Initialize dp array
    dp = [0] * (amount + 1)
    dp[0] = 1
    
    # Iterate over each coin
    for coin in coins:
        for x in range(coin, amount + 1):
            dp[x] += dp[x - coin]

    return dp[amount]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N * M), where `N` is the `amount` and `M` is the number of coins. This is because we traverse the `coins` list, and for each coin, we update the `dp` array for `amount` times.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(N), where `N` is the `amount`. This is due to the space used by the `dp` array.

This approach ensures we efficiently compute the number of ways to reach the given amount using the provided coins, employing dynamic programming to avoid redundant calculations.
