title:  Minimum Number of Coins to be Added-out
permalink: /s2952
---

You are given an array `coins` representing the values of the coins you have. Additionally, you are given a value `k`. You need to determine the minimum number of coins needed to sum up to exactly `k`. If it's not possible to make the sum `k` with the given coins, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are `coins` given in any particular order?**
   - No, the coins are not given in any particular order.

2. **Can `coins` contain duplicate values?**
   - Yes, `coins` can contain duplicate values.

3. **What are the constraints on the values in `coins` and `k`?**
   - The values can range from 1 to 10000.

4. **Is performance a concern?**
   - Yes, the solution should be optimized to handle large inputs efficiently.

5. **Is it guaranteed that `coins` will not be empty and `k` will be a positive integer?**
   - Yes, it is guaranteed.

### Strategy

We can approach this problem using a dynamic programming technique known as the coin change problem. The steps are as follows:

1. **Initialize a DP Array:** Create an array `dp` where `dp[i]` holds the minimum number of coins required to make the sum `i`.

2. **Base Case:** Initialize `dp[0]` as `0` because 0 coins are required to make the sum of 0. Initialize all other `dp[i]` as infinity (`float('inf')`), representing that initially, they are unachievable.

3. **DP Transition:** For each coin in `coins`, update the DP array. For each possible sum `i`, update `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)` if `i - coin >= 0`. This ensures we are considering the minimum coins required for each sum.

4. **Final Answer:** If `dp[k]` is still infinity, return `-1`, indicating that it's not possible to make the sum `k`. Otherwise, return `dp[k]`.

### Code

```python
def minimum_coins_to_make_k(coins, k):
    # Initialize the dp array with a large value representing infinity.
    dp = [float('inf')] * (k + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    
    # Perform the DP update
    for coin in coins:
        for i in range(coin, k + 1):
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1)
    
    # If dp[k] is still infinity, it means we cannot form the sum k
    return dp[k] if dp[k] != float('inf') else -1
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization:** Initializing the `dp` array takes \(O(k)\) time.
- **DP Update:** Updating the `dp` array involves nested loops. The outer loop iterates over each coin \(O(n)\), and the inner loop iterates over the range from the coin value to `k` \(O(k)\). Thus, the overall complexity is \(O(n \times k)\).
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity of the algorithm is \(O(k)\) due to the `dp` array.

This solution efficiently calculates the minimum number of coins needed to make the sum `k` or determines if it is impossible, meeting the performance constraints given the problem's typical input size.
