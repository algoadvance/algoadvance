Given two integers `n` and `k`, you need to construct a list that contains integers from `1` to `n` such that the list has exactly `k` distinct integers like this. If several such lists exist, you may return any of them.

### Example

```
Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: [1, 2, 3]

Input: n = 3, k = 2
Output: [1, 3, 2] or [2, 3, 1]
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= k < n <= 10^4`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the same integer appear more than once in the list?**
   - No, the integers must be unique and range from `1` to `n`.

2. **What defines a distinct integer sequence in this context?**
   - A sequence is considered to have `k` distinct integers if the absolute difference between consecutive elements in the sequence includes exactly `k` distinct values.

3. **Are there any specific time constraints on the solution?**
   - The solution should be efficient, ideally linear or near-linear time complexity.

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we need a plan that ensures we use exactly `k` distinct absolute differences between consecutive elements. Here’s an effective strategy:

1. **Forming Basic Structure:**
   - We can start by constructing a sequence that inherently has `k` distinct absolute differences.
   - To achieve `k` distinct differences, use a combination of increasing and decreasing series.

2. **Implementing the Plan:**
   - Begin with an alternating sequence that guarantees `k` distinct differences:
     - Start with [1, n, 2, n-1, 3, n-2, ...] until you reach `k+1` elements.
   - Fill the rest of the sequence in a sorted manner to maintain the increasing order from `k+1` difference onward.

## Code

Here’s how to implement it in Python:

```python
def constructArray(n, k):
    result = []
    left, right = 1, n
    while left <= right:
        if k > 1:
            if k % 2:
                result.append(left)
                left += 1
            else:
                result.append(right)
                right -= 1
            k -= 1
        else:
            result.extend(range(left, right + 1))
            break
    return result

# Example Usage:
n = 3
k = 2
print(constructArray(n, k))  # Output: [1, 3, 2] or any valid sequence
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(n)** because we iterate through the range from 1 to `n` once.

- The space complexity is **O(1)** beyond the output list since we only use a few additional variables for tracking purposes.
