title:  Super Ugly Number-out
permalink: /s313
---

You are given an array of integers `primes` and an integer `n`. A super ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are in the array `primes`. Return the nth super ugly number.

The nth super ugly number is guaranteed to fit in a 32-bit signed integer.

### Example:
```python
Input: n = 12, primes = [2,7,13,19]
Output: 32
Explanation: [1, 2, 4, 7, 8, 13, 14, 16, 19, 26, 28, 32] is the sequence of the first 12 super ugly numbers given primes = [2,7,13,19].
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 10^6`
- `1 <= primes.length <= 100`
- `2 <= primes[i] <= 1000`
- `primes[i]` is guaranteed to be a prime number.
- All the values of `primes` are unique and sorted in ascending order.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can I assume that the array `primes` will always be non-empty and sorted?
2. Should the function return the `nth` super ugly number as an integer?

## Strategy

1. **Initialization:** Use a min-heap (priority queue) to keep track of the current smallest super ugly number candidates.
2. **Heap Operations:** Initialize the heap with the first `prime` multiplied by 1 (the first super ugly number).
3. **Generate Super Ugly Numbers:** Use a loop to extract the smallest element from the heap, add new candidates by multiplying this smallest element with each `prime`, and push these new candidates back into the heap.
4. **Avoid Duplicates:** Use a set to keep track of numbers that have been added to the heap to avoid duplicates.
5. **Stopping Condition:** Repeat the above process until we've extracted `n` super ugly numbers.

## Code

Hereâ€™s the implementation in Python:

```python
import heapq

def nthSuperUglyNumber(n, primes):
    heap = [1]
    seen = {1}
    ugly = 1

    for _ in range(n):
        ugly = heapq.heappop(heap)
        for prime in primes:
            new_ugly = ugly * prime
            if new_ugly not in seen:
                seen.add(new_ugly)
                heapq.heappush(heap, new_ugly)

    return ugly
```

## Time Complexity

- **Heap Operations:** Each insertion and extraction operation on the heap takes O(log m), where m is the size of the heap.
- **Outer Loop:** Runs `n` times.
- **Inner Loop:** Runs for each `prime`.

Hence, the overall time complexity is approximately O(n * k * log m), where:
- `n` is the target index.
- `k` is the number of primes.
- `m` is the number of elements in the heap, bounded by the number of unique products generated in the process.

This approach should be efficient enough given the constraints of the problem.
