title:  Shortest Palindrome-out
permalink: /s214
---

The problem is taken from LeetCode with reference number 214, titled "Shortest Palindrome."

Given a string `s`, you need to find the shortest palindrome you can form by adding characters in front of it. 

A palindrome is a string that reads the same backward as forward.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What is the length limit of the input string `s`?
    - Can the input string `s` be empty?
    - Are there any restrictions on the type of characters in `s` (ASCII, Unicode, etc.)?

2. **Expected Output:**
    - Should the final output just be the shortest palindrome, or is additional information required?

### Code

Hereâ€™s the Python code to find the shortest palindrome by adding characters in front of the input string `s`:

```python
def shortestPalindrome(s: str) -> str:
    def computeKMPTable(s):
        table = [0] * len(s)
        index = 0  # length of the previous longest prefix suffix
        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            if s[i] == s[index]:
                index += 1
                table[i] = index
            else:
                if index != 0:
                    index = table[index - 1]
                    i -= 1  # stay at the current i (don't move to next character)
                else:
                    table[i] = 0
        return table
    
    if not s:
        return ""
    
    rev_s = s[::-1]
    new_s = s + "#" + rev_s
    kmp_table = computeKMPTable(new_s)
    longest_palindromic_prefix_length = kmp_table[-1]
    
    add_on = rev_s[:len(s) - longest_palindromic_prefix_length]
    return add_on + s
```

### Strategy

1. **Reverse the String:** First, reverse the given string `s`.

2. **Concatenate the Strings:** Form a new string that concatenates the original string `s`, a separator (to ensure no overlapped partial palindromes are considered), and the reversed string.

3. **KMP Table Construction:** Use the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) pattern matching algorithm to preprocess the concatenated string to find the longest prefix of `s` that is also a suffix.

4. **Determine the Shortest Palindrome:** Using the KMP table, determine the characters that need to be added in front of `s` to form the shortest palindrome. These characters are derived from the suffix of the reversed string that wasn't matched by the longest palindromic prefix of `s`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The KMP table construction runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the new concatenated string, which is 2m + 1 (with m being the length of `s`). Hence, the overall time complexity is O(m).

- **Space Complexity:** The auxiliary space used is O(m) for the KMP table and the reversed string, making the space complexity O(m).

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient even for large strings.
