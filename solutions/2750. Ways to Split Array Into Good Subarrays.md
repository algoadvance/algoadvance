title:  Ways to Split Array Into Good Subarrays-out
permalink: /s2750
---

You are given a binary array `nums` (an array consisting of only `0`s and `1`s). A subarray is considered good if it contains exactly one `1`.

Return the number of ways to split `nums` into exactly `k` good subarrays.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the array length (`n`) and the value of `k`?**
    - The length of `nums` can be very large, up to \(10^5\). The value of `k` can also be large but will not exceed the length of `nums`.

2. **What is the input type and constraints?**
    - `nums` is a list of integers where each integer is either `0` or `1`.
    - `k` is an integer.

3. **What should be returned?**
    - Return an integer representing the number of ways to split the array into exactly `k` good subarrays.

4. **Can `k` be zero or larger than the number of `1`s in `nums`?**
    - If `k` is zero or more than the number of `1`s, the result should be 0 because it's invalid to split into that many good subarrays.

### Strategy

1. **Identify the positions of `1`s**: Identify all indices in the array where the value is `1`. These positions determine where all good subarrays can start or end.
   
2. **Count Good Subarrays**: If there are fewer `1`s than `k`, then it's impossible to form `k` good subarrays. Return 0 in this case.

3. **Calculate Gaps Between `1`s**: Calculate the number of zeros between consecutive `1`s. These gaps will determine the number of ways we can split the array.

4. **Compute Number of Splits**: For each adjacent `1`, the number of ways to split between them will be determined by the number of zeros plus one (considering insertion points between zeros).

### Implementation

Given the above understanding, let's implement the solution in Python.

```python
def countGoodSubarrays(nums, k):
    # Step 1: Identify the positions of all 1s
    positions = [i for i, num in enumerate(nums) if num == 1]

    # Step 2: If fewer 1s than k, return 0
    if len(positions) < k:
        return 0

    # Step 3: Compute gaps between consecutive 1s and calculate the number of splits
    gaps = []
    for i in range(1, len(positions)):
        gaps.append(positions[i] - positions[i-1] - 1)

    # Initialize ways to split to 1 (between the first 1 and the k-th 1)
    ways_to_split = 1

    # We only need k-1 splits between k adjacent 1s to maintain k good subarrays
    for i in range(k-1):
        ways_to_split *= gaps[i] + 1

    return ways_to_split

# Example usage
nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1]
k = 2
print(countGoodSubarrays(nums, k))  # Output will vary based on instance
```

### Time Complexity

- **Identifying positions of `1`s**: O(n) where `n` is the length of the array.
- **Calculating gaps and computing splits**: O(k).

Overall, the algorithm runs in O(n+k) time where `n` is the length of the array and `k` is the required number of good subarrays.

This should be efficient for input sizes within the constraints provided.
