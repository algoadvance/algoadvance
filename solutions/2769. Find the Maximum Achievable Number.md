title:  Find the Maximum Achievable Number-out
permalink: /s2769
---

You are given two integers, `num` and `t`. The task is to find the maximum achievable number by changing `num` at most `t` times by either adding 1 or subtracting 1 to/from it.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `t` be negative?**
   - No, `t` will be a non-negative integer.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the values of `num` and `t`?**
   - The problem statement does not specify particular constraints, but typically, both would be within reasonable integer ranges for interview problems.

3. **Is there a specific range of inputs we should consider?**
   - For a coding interview, you'd commonly expect `num` to be within the range of Python's integer capabilities, and `t` is usually a small to moderately large non-negative integer.

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   If we are allowed to change the number `t` times, to find the maximum achievable number, we simply add 1 to `num` `t` times.

2. **Example:**
   - If `num = 5` and `t = 3`, the maximum achievable number would be `5 + 3 = 8`.

3. **Approach:**
   - Compute the result by adding `t` to `num`.

### Code

Here's the Python function to achieve this:

```python
def find_max_achievable_number(num: int, t: int) -> int:
    return num + t

# Example Usage
num = 5
t = 3
print(find_max_achievable_number(num, t))  # Output: 8
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of the solution is **O(1)** because the computation involves a constant-time addition operation.
- The space complexity is also **O(1)** as we are not using any additional space that scales with input size.
