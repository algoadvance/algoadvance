title:  Shuffle the Array-out
permalink: /s1470
---

Leetcode problem 1470 states:
Given the array `nums` consisting of `2n` elements in the form `[x1,x2,...,xn,y1,y2,...,yn]`, return the array in the form `[x1,y1,x2,y2,...,xn,yn]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Q: Is the input always a list of even length where the length of the list is `2n`?
   A: Yes.
2. Q: Is there any constraint on the values of the elements in the list, such as them being integers?
   A: Yes, elements are integers as per standard Leetcode constraints.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, you can utilize a simple iteration approach. Follow these steps:
1. Divide the array into two halves.
2. Iterate through these two halves simultaneously.
3. Combine elements from each half alternately into a new result list.

### Code

Here's how you can implement this:

```python
def shuffle(nums, n):
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        result.append(nums[i])
        result.append(nums[i + n])
    return result
```

### Explanation

1. Initialize an empty list `result` which will store the final shuffled array.
2. Loop through the first half of the array using an index `i`.
3. Append the `i`-th element of the first half and the `i`-th element of the second half to the result list.
4. Continue until you have added all the elements from both halves alternately to the result list.
5. Return the `result` list.

### Time Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** The algorithm runs in `O(n)` time where `n` is the input list's half-length (or `2n` is the full length), as it involves iterating through the array linearly once.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is `O(n)` for the resulting list, not considering the input list space.

This offers a fairly efficient solution for the problem at hand.
