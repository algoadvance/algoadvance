title:  Shortest String That Contains Three Strings-out
permalink: /s2800
---
You are given three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`. Your task is to generate the shortest string `s` that contains all three strings `a`, `b`, and `c` as substrings. The string `s` must be constructed by only inserting the other strings without any other modifications or reorderings.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the three strings be empty?
2. Are the strings composed of only lowercase English letters?
3. Can we assume that the inputs are always valid strings?

Given these typical constraints:
- Strings `a`, `b`, and `c` can have lengths from 0 to 100.
- The characters are always lowercase English letters.

### Strategy
1. **Check All Permutations**: Since there are three strings, we can consider each possible permutation: `a b c`, `a c b`, `b a c`, `b c a`, `c a b`, `c b a`.
2. **Merge with Overlap**: For each permutation, we need to merge the strings in a way that minimizes duplication. We use a helper function `merge(s1, s2)` which merges two strings such that the resulting string contains both with the least amount of added characters.
3. **Find the Shortest Result**: For each of the six permutations, compute the merged string and keep track of the shortest one.

### Helper Function: Merging two strings
To merge two strings `s1` and `s2`:
1. Find the maximum overlap where the suffix of `s1` matches the prefix of `s2`.
2. If there is no overlap, simply concatenate `s2` to `s1`.

### Code
```python
def shortest_string_containing_three_strings(a: str, b: str, c: str) -> str:
    from itertools import permutations
    
    def merge(s1: str, s2: str) -> str:
        # Find the longest suffix of s1 that is a prefix of s2
        max_overlap = 0
        for i in range(1, min(len(s1), len(s2)) + 1):
            if s1[-i:] == s2[:i]:
                max_overlap = i
        return s1 + s2[max_overlap:]
    
    # Generate all permutations of a, b, c
    perm = permutations([a, b, c])
    shortest_s = None
    
    for p in perm:
        s1, s2, s3 = p
        # Merge them in order specified by the permutation
        merged_string = merge(merge(s1, s2), s3)
        if shortest_s is None or len(merged_string) < len(shortest_s):
            shortest_s = merged_string
    
    return shortest_s

# Example usage:
a = "abc"
b = "bcde"
c = "def"
print(shortest_string_containing_three_strings(a, b, c))  # Output: "abcdef"
```

### Time Complexity
- **Merging Time**: Each merge operation takes O(n + m) time in the worst case, where n and m are the lengths of the strings being merged.
- **Permutations**: There are 3! = 6 permutations of the three strings.
- **Total Time**: Since we perform the merge operation twice for each permutation, the overall time complexity would be O(6 * (n + m + k)), where n, m, k are lengths of the strings. This simplifies to O(n + m + k), given constant factors and assuming logarithmic linear merges.

This approach is efficient given the problem constraints and ensures we find the shortest string containing all three input strings.
