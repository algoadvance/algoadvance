title:  Number of Strings Which Can Be Rearranged to Contain Substring-out
permalink: /s2930
---
Given a list of strings, we need to determine how many of these strings can be rearranged to contain a specific substring `out`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be the type of input and output?**
   - Input: A list of strings.
   - Output: An integer representing the number of strings that can be rearranged to contain the substring `out`.

2. **Are there any constraints on the length of the strings or the list?**
   - Strings can be of varying lengths.
   - There is no specific constraint mentioned for the length of the list.

3. **Can the same string repeat in the input list?**
   - Yes, strings can repeat.

4. **Do the strings contain only lowercase alphabets?**
   - Yes, we'll assume strings contain only lowercase alphabets based on usual constraints unless specified otherwise.

### Strategy
To determine if a string can be rearranged to contain the substring `out`, the string must have at least one 'o', one 'u', and one 't'. 

**Steps**:

1. Iterate through the list of strings.
2. For each string, check if it contains at least one 'o', one 'u', and one 't'.
3. If it does, increment the count.
4. Return the final count.

### Code

```python
def num_strings_with_substring_out(strings):
    def can_form_out(s):
        return s.count('o') >= 1 and s.count('u') >= 1 and s.count('t') >= 1
        
    count = 0
    for string in strings:
        if can_form_out(string):
            count += 1
    return count

# Sample Test
strings = ['out', 'tuo', 'ou', 'toou', 'abc']
print(num_strings_with_substring_out(strings))  # Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity
- **Checking a single string**: O(n) where n is the length of the string to count characters 'o', 'u', and 't'.
- **Total time complexity** is O(m * n) where m is the number of strings and n is the average length of the strings.

Given the linear scanning and counting operations, this solution should be efficient for reasonably sized inputs.
