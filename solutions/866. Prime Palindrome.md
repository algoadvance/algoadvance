Given an integer `n`, find the smallest prime palindrome greater than or equal to `n`.

1. A prime number is a number that is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself.
2. A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of characters that reads the same forward and backward.

You need to write a function `prime_palindrome(n: int) -> int` that returns the smallest prime palindrome greater than or equal to `n`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of the input integer `n`?
    - The problem doesn't specify explicitly, but for LeetCode problems, the input is usually within the range `1 <= n <= 10^8`.
2. Is there any preference regarding the time complexity of the solution?
    - The aim is always to have a well-optimized solution. However, given that this involves prime checks and palindrome checks, a brute force solution might be acceptable initially, followed by optimizations if needed.

## Strategy 
To solve this problem, the following steps can be followed:

1. **Helper Function for Prime Check**: Create a function to check if a number is prime.
2. **Helper Function for Palindrome Check**: Create a function to check if a number is a palindrome.
3. **Find the Smallest Prime Palindrome**: Starting from `n`, iterate the numbers upwards until a number is found that is both prime and a palindrome.

### Step 1: Prime Check

We'll create a function `is_prime` that uses trial-division to determine if a number is prime.

### Step 2: Palindrome Check

We'll create a function `is_palindrome` to check if a number reads the same forward and backward.

### Step 3: Iterative Search

Using a loop starting from `n`, use both helper functions to find the smallest prime palindrome.

### Optimization Consideration

1. **Skip Even Length Palindromes**: All even-length palindromes are divisible by 11 except the smallest even-length palindromes like 11. This can help reduce checks.
2. **Handle Edge Conditions**: Given that very large prime palindromes are rare, it is necessary to ensure efficiency especially for upper bound values.

### Time Complexity

- **Prime Check**: `O(sqrt(n))`
- **Palindrome Check**: `O(d)` where `d` is the number of digits in `n`
- The iterative search will stop as soon as we find the answer.

## Code

```python
def prime_palindrome(n: int) -> int:
    def is_prime(x: int) -> bool:
        if x < 2:
            return False
        for i in range(2, int(x**0.5) + 1):
            if x % i == 0:
                return False
        return True

    def is_palindrome(x: int) -> bool:
        return str(x) == str(x)[::-1]

    # Palindrome generation can be more optimal but let's begin simple and correct
    while True:
        if is_palindrome(n) and is_prime(n):
            return n
        n += 1

# Let's test the provided function
print(prime_palindrome(6))  # Expected output: 7
print(prime_palindrome(8))  # Expected output: 11
print(prime_palindrome(13)) # Expected output: 101

# Note: Further optimization like skipping even-length palindromes can be added.
```

This initial solution will work correctly needs testing for performance to ensure it runs efficiently for larger values of `n`. Further steps will involve optimizing palindrome generation and skipping certain non-palindromic ranges intelligently.
