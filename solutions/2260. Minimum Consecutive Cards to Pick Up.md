title:  Minimum Consecutive Cards to Pick Up-out
permalink: /s2260
---
You are given an integer array `cards` where `cards[i]` represents the value of the `i-th` card. A player must pick up cards sequentially, and the goal is to find the minimum number of consecutive cards to pick up such that there are at least two cards with the same value. Otherwise, return `-1` if it’s impossible to meet the condition.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input constraints:**
   - What is the range of values in the `cards` array?
   - What is the maximum length of the `cards` array?

2. **Output specifics:**
   - Should the output always be an integer? (e.g., `-1` when a valid subarray is not found)

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach to efficiently track the occurrences of card values as we traverse through the array. Here's a detailed strategy:

1. **Sliding Window Technique:**
   - Use a dictionary to keep track of the last index where each card value appeared.
   - Iterate through the `cards` array, updating this dictionary.
   - For each card, if it has been seen before, calculate the number of cards between the current index and the last occurrence (inclusive) and update the minimum length found.
   
2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If there are no repeated values in the entire array, return `-1`.
   - Handle arrays with a single card value gracefully.

### Code
Here’s a Python function implementing the described strategy:

```python
def minimumCardPickup(cards):
    last_seen = {}
    min_length = float('inf')  # Initialize the minimum length to infinity
    
    for i, card in enumerate(cards):
        if card in last_seen:
            min_length = min(min_length, i - last_seen[card] + 1)
        last_seen[card] = i
    
    return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1

# Example test cases
print(minimumCardPickup([3, 4, 2, 3, 4, 7]))  # Output: 4
print(minimumCardPickup([1, 0, 5, 3]))         # Output: -1
```

### Explanation
1. **Dictionary Initialization:**
   - `last_seen` keeps track of the most recent index for each card value encountered.
   
2. **Iterate Through Cards:**
   - For each card in the array, check if it has been seen before using the dictionary.
   - If it has been seen, compute the length of the current subarray and update `min_length` if this subarray is shorter than the current minimum.
   - Update the last seen index for the card to the current index.

3. **Return Result:**
   - If `min_length` was updated from `float('inf')`, it means a valid subarray was found; otherwise, return `-1`.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `cards` array because we are making a single pass through the array.
- Space complexity is also \(O(n)\) due to the additional dictionary used to track last seen indices of card values.

This provides an efficient solution to the problem by leveraging the sliding window technique and dictionary data structure.
