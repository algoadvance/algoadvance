title:  Stickers to Spell Word-out
permalink: /s691
---

We are given a list of `stickers` and a `target` string. Each sticker is represented by a string containing lowercase English letters, and we can use each sticker as many times as we want. Our goal is to find the minimum number of stickers required to form the `target` string. If itâ€™s impossible to form the target string with the given stickers, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **What should be returned if a target cannot be formed?**
   - We should return `-1`.

2. **Can the stickers list be empty?**
   - No, there is always at least one sticker in the input list.

3. **Can stickers have repeated characters?**
   - Yes, stickers can have repeated characters, and they can be used multiple times.

4. **Are there any special characters or upper case letters in the input?**
   - No, the input only contains lowercase English letters.

### Strategy:

1. **Frequency Count:**
   - Use frequency counts for both stickers and the target string to facilitate direct comparisons.

2. **Memoization:**
   - Since this problem has overlapping subproblems, memoization can reduce the number of recursive calls and hence reduce overall computation time.

3. **Recursive Approach:**
   - Use a recursive approach to explore combinations of stickers needed to form the target string. Memoize results for subproblems to avoid recomputations.

4. **Pruning:**
   - Effective pruning involves skipping stickers that do not contribute to the current needs of the target string.

### Code:

```python
from collections import Counter
from functools import lru_cache

def minStickers(stickers, target):
    # Convert stickers to a list of frequency counters
    sticker_counts = [Counter(sticker) for sticker in stickers]
    target_count = Counter(target)
    
    @lru_cache(None)
    def dfs(remain):
        # Base case: if no characters remain in target
        if not remain:
            return 0
        
        # Convert remain to a counter dictionary
        remain_count = Counter(remain)
        min_stickers = float('inf')
        
        # Try to use each sticker
        for sticker in sticker_counts:
            # If the sticker contributes to reducing the target
            if sticker[remain[0]] > 0:
                # Create a new remaining target string after applying the sticker once
                new_remain = []
                for char, count in remain_count.items():
                    if count - sticker[char] > 0:
                        new_remain.append(char * (count - sticker[char]))
                new_remain = ''.join(new_remain)
                
                result = dfs(new_remain)
                if result != -1:
                    min_stickers = min(min_stickers, 1 + result)
        
        return min_stickers if min_stickers != float('inf') else -1
    
    result = dfs(target)
    return result

# Example Usage:
stickers = ["with", "example", "science"]
target = "thehat"
print(minStickers(stickers, target))  # Expected output: 3
```

### Time Complexity:

- The time complexity is hard to analyze precisely because it heavily depends on the content of the stickers and the target string. The worst case is exponential, but memoization substantially reduces the number of subproblems computed.
- Since each subproblem result is stored, the overall time complexity is bound by the number of unique subproblem states, which can be approximated but depends on specific input characteristics.

This approach effectively balances clarity and efficiency to navigate the computation space.
