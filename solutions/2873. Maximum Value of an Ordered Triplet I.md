title:  Maximum Value of an Ordered Triplet I-out
permalink: /s2873
---

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. You have to find the maximum value of the expression `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k]` such that `0 <= i < j < k < nums.length`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input size**: How large can the array `nums` be? This will help in assessing the efficiency requirements.
2. **Element values**: Are there any constraints on the values of the elements in `nums` (e.g., can they be negative or are they always positive)?
3. **Output**: What should be returned if array `nums` has fewer than 3 elements?

### Code

```python
def max_value_ordered_triplet(nums):
    if len(nums) < 3:
        return None  # or some other error value depending on the requirements

    # Initialize the maximum values for the triplet
    max1, max2, max3 = float('-inf'), float('-inf'), float('-inf')

    # Traverse the array from right to left
    for num in reversed(nums):
        if num > max3:
            max1, max2, max3 = max2, max3, num
        elif num > max2:
            max1, max2 = max2, num
        elif num > max1:
            max1 = num

    return max1 + max2 + max3
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Start by checking if the length of `nums` is fewer than 3. If so, return a specific value (None or any other requirement-based value) since no triplet exists.
2. **Maximum Values**: Use three variables (`max1`, `max2`, `max3`) to keep track of the top three maximum values in the array.
3. **Traversal**: Iterate through the array in reverse to ensure that we are considering the correct order of indices (i < j < k).
4. **Updating Maximums**: For each element in the array, appropriately update `max1`, `max2`, and `max3` to maintain the top three maximum values found so far.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm runs in O(n), where n is the length of `nums`, because it involves a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This approach ensures we find the maximum value of an ordered triplet efficiently.
