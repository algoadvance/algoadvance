title:  As Far from Land as Possible-out

You are given an `n x n` grid `grid` containing only values 0 and 1 where 0 represents water and 1 represents land. An island is a 4-directionally connected group of 1s.

The task is to find the maximum distance from the land to the nearest water cell.

The distance used in this problem is the Manhattan distance: the distance between two cells \((x0, y0)\) and \((x1, y1)\) is \(|x0 - x1| + |y0 - y1|\).

Return the maximum distance from land to the nearest water cell. If no land or water exists in the grid, return -1.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Grid Size:** What is the size range for the grid `n x n`?
   - The grid size can range from \(1 x 1\) to \(100 x 100\).

2. **Edge Cases:** What if there is no land or no water in the grid at all?
   - If there is no land or water, return -1.

3. **All Cells Land or Water:** What if all cells are land or all cells are water?
   - Similarly, if all cells are land or all cells are water, return -1.

## Strategy

This problem can be effectively tackled using a breadth-first search (BFS):

1. **Multi-source BFS:** Start BFS from all land cells (cells with 1) simultaneously. This approach helps in finding the maximum distance to water in an expanding wavefront manner.
2. **Queue Initialization:** Initialize the queue with all land cells and mark distance from these cells to themselves as zero.
3. **BFS Execution:** From each land cell, propagate to its 4-directional neighbors until no more cells can be visited.
4. **Track Maximum Distance:** Throughout the BFS process, track the maximum distance from land to water.
5. **Result:** Return the maximum distance. If no water cell is found during BFS, return -1.

## Code

```python
from collections import deque

def maxDistance(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    queue = deque()
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Enqueue all land positions and mark them visited
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                queue.append((i, j))
                visited[i][j] = True

    # If all cells are land or all cells are water, return -1
    if not queue or len(queue) == n * n:
        return -1
    
    directions = [(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1)]
    max_dist = -1

    while queue:
        x, y = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n and not visited[nx][ny]:
                visited[nx][ny] = True
                grid[nx][ny] = grid[x][y] + 1  # Update distance from the nearest land
                max_dist = max(max_dist, grid[nx][ny] - 1)
                queue.append((nx, ny))

    return max_dist

# Example usage
grid = [
  [1,0,1],
  [0,0,0],
  [1,0,1]
]
print(maxDistance(grid)) # Output should be 2
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the dimension of the grid. This is because each cell is processed at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n^2)\) for the queue and the visited matrix.

This BFS solution ensures that we find the maximum distance from any land to the nearest water cell efficiently.
