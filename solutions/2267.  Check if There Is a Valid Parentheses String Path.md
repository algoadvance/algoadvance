2267. Check if There Is a Valid Parentheses String Path

You are given a `m x n` matrix `grid` consisting of `0`s (representing an open parenthesis `'('`) and `1`s (representing a close parenthesis `')'`). A **valid parentheses string** is a string consisting only of `'('` and `')'` that satisfies the following conditions:
1. The string is non-empty.
2. The number of close parentheses `')'` never exceeds the number of open parentheses `'('` at any point (i.e., the string is "balanced").
3. The total number of open parentheses `'('` is equal to the total number of close parentheses `')'`.

A **valid parentheses string path** in the matrix is a path from the top-left cell `(0, 0)` to the bottom-right cell `(m-1, n-1)` such that the concatenated string formed by the cells along the path is a valid parentheses string. You can move either right or down from a cell.

Return `true` if there exists a valid parentheses string path in the grid. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Matrix Constraints:**
   - Are the dimensions of the grid always greater than zero?
   - Can the grid's cells contain any characters other than `0` and `1`?

2. **Path Restrictions:**
   - Are we allowed to revisit cells on this path?

3. **Function Signature:**
   - What should the function signature look like? For example, `def hasValidPath(grid: List[List[int]]) -> bool`.

### Code

```python
def hasValidPath(grid):
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return False
    
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    dp = [[None] * n for _ in range(m)]
    dp[0][0] = (1 if grid[0][0] == 0 else -1)
    
    if dp[0][0] < 0:
        return False
    
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if i == 0 and j == 0: 
                continue
            
            open_count = -1
            if i > 0 and dp[i-1][j] != None:
                open_count = dp[i-1][j] + (1 if grid[i][j] == 0 else -1)
                
            if j > 0 and dp[i][j-1] != None:
                open_count = max(open_count, dp[i][j-1] + (1 if grid[i][j] == 0 else -1))
            
            if open_count >= 0:
                dp[i][j] = open_count
            
    return dp[-1][-1] == 0
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Check the edge case where the grid is invalid (empty).
   - Initialize a DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` stores the maximum open parentheses count up to cell `(i, j)`.

2. **Base Case:**
   - Set the starting point based on whether it starts with an open parenthesis or close parenthesis. If it starts with a closing parenthesis, it's already invalid.

3. **DP Transition:**
   - For each cell, compute the number of open parentheses from the top and left cells.
   - If at any point we encounter more closing parentheses than opening parentheses, set the value to `None`.

4. **Final Check:**
   - Ensure that the bottom-right cell has an exact count of zero open parentheses, indicating a complete and valid balancing of parentheses.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n)` where `m` is the number of rows, and `n` is the number of columns. We iterate over each cell once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(m * n)` due to the DP table used to store intermediate results.
