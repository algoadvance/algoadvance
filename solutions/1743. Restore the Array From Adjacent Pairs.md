title:  Restore the Array From Adjacent Pairs-out
permalink: /s1743
---

You are given an array of `n` pairs of integers `adjacentPairs` where each pair `(u, v)` indicates that the elements `u` and `v` are adjacent in an array. Your task is to restore the array from these pairs and return it. The array will contain all the integers from the pairs, with no duplicates.

**Example:**
```python
Input: adjacentPairs = [[2,1],[3,4],[3,2]]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the given pairs form more than one valid array?**
   No, the given pairs will always form exactly one valid array.

2. **What if the input contains only one pair?**
   The output will simply be the single pair as an array.

3. **Are there any constraints on the size of `adjacentPairs`?**
   The constraints usually follow typical competitive programming limits, but letâ€™s assume the input size is manageable within regular memory and time constraints.

### Strategy

1. **Building the Adjacency List:** First, we will create an adjacency list using a dictionary where each key is a value from the pairs, and its value is a list of adjacent values.

2. **Finding the Start of the Array:** The element that appears only once in the adjacency list will be at the end of the array (start or end), because every other element should have exactly two adjacent elements (one on either side).

3. **Reconstructing the Array:** Starting from the identified unique element, we will reconstruct the array by walking through the adjacency list.

### Code

Here is the code to restore the array from the given adjacent pairs:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def restoreArray(adjacentPairs):
    # Step 1: Create an adjacency list
    adj_list = defaultdict(list)
    for a, b in adjacentPairs:
        adj_list[a].append(b)
        adj_list[b].append(a)
    
    # Step 2: Find the starting point of the array
    start = None
    for key in adj_list:
        if len(adj_list[key]) == 1:
            start = key
            break
    
    # Step 3: Reconstruct the array
    restored_array = []
    current = start
    prev = None
    
    while current is not None:
        restored_array.append(current)
        neighbors = adj_list[current]
        next_node = None
        # Find the next node to move to
        for neighbor in neighbors:
            if neighbor != prev:
                next_node = neighbor
                break
        prev = current
        current = next_node
    
    return restored_array
```

### Time Complexity

- **Building the Adjacency List:** This takes \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the number of pairs, as we iterate through all pairs exactly once.
- **Finding the Start of the Array:** This takes \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the number of unique elements (effectively the same order as `n`).
- **Reconstructing the Array:** This also takes \(O(m)\), since we visit each node exactly once.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\).
