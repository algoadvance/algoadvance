title:  Minimum Equal Sum of Two Arrays After Replacing Zeros-out
permalink: /s2918
---

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` both of size `n`, you can perform the following operation on either `nums1` or `nums2` any number of times: replace any element in the array with `0`. After performing some operations, if the total sum of all elements in `nums1` is equal to the total sum of all elements in `nums2`, return the minimum possible sum for both arrays. If this is not possible, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the size of the arrays (`n`)?**
   - Any typical constraints such as `1 <= n <= 10^5`?

2. **What is the range of values for elements in `nums1` and `nums2`?**
   - Are there negative numbers, or are they limited to non-negative integers?

3. **Are arrays guaranteed to have elements that can be reduced to achieve equal sums?**
   - Is achieving equal sums always possible?

Without explicit constraints and sample input/output, I will assume:
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- Elements are non-negative integers.

### Strategy

1. **Compute Initial Sums**: Calculate the initial sums of both arrays.
2. **Difference Between Sums**: Determine the absolute difference between the sums of `nums1` and `nums2`.
3. **Replacement to 0**:
   - Replace elements strategically in the array with the larger sum to balance the difference.
   - Replacing elements with `0` will incrementally reduce the sum.
   - Prioritize replacing the largest elements first to reduce the difference efficiently.
4. **Balance Check**:
   - If we can keep reducing the sum of the larger array until it matches the sum of the smaller array, compute the resulting sum.
   - If not, return `-1`.

### Code

```python
def min_equal_sum(nums1, nums2):
    sum1 = sum(nums1)
    sum2 = sum(nums2)
    
    if sum1 == sum2:
        return sum1  # Sums are already equal
    
    if sum1 > sum2:
        diff = sum1 - sum2
        larger_array = sorted(nums1, reverse=True)
    else:
        diff = sum2 - sum1
        larger_array = sorted(nums2, reverse=True)
        
    for num in larger_array:
        diff -= num
        if diff <= 0:
            return sum1 - (sum1 - sum2) + (sum2 - diff)
    
    return -1

# Test Cases
print(min_equal_sum([1, 2, 3], [1, 1, 1]))  # Example case
print(min_equal_sum([10, 20, 30], [10, 20, 0]))  # Balancing needed
print(min_equal_sum([5, 5, 5], [5, 5, 5]))  # Already equal
print(min_equal_sum([1, 2, 3], [7]))  # Not possible to balance
```

### Time Complexity

- Calculating the sums of `nums1` and `nums2` takes O(n).
- Sorting the `larger_array` takes O(n log n).
- Iterating through the largest elements takes O(n) in the worst case.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.

This algorithm ensures that we minimize the sum of the arrays while making them equal, if possible.
