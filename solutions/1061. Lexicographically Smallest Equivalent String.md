title:  Lexicographically Smallest Equivalent String-out
permalink: /s1061
---

Given two strings of the same length `s1` and `s2`, and a string `baseStr`, the task is to transform each letter in `baseStr` to the lexicographically smallest equivalent letter. The equivalence of characters is determined by an equivalence relation, which includes the mappings established by `s1` and `s2`. 

## Example:
- Input: `s1 = "parker"`, `s2 = "morris"`, `baseStr = "parser"`
- Output: `makkek`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the strings `s1` and `s2` guaranteed to have the same length?**
   - Yes, they are guaranteed to have the same length.

2. **What characters can the strings contain?**
   - The strings can contain lowercase English letters only.

3. **Will the transformed string `baseStr` consist of lowercase English letters after transformation?**
   - Yes, it will consist of lowercase English letters.

4. **Should we consider case sensitivity?**
   - The problem specifies only lowercase English letters, so no need to consider case sensitivity.

## Strategy
1. **Union-Find Data Structure:** 
   - We'll use the Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU) data structure to manage and determine the equivalence relations between characters in `s1` and `s2`.

2. **Union Operation:** 
   - For each pair of characters in `s1` and `s2`, we'll unify them using their sets to indicate that they are equivalent.

3. **Find Operation:** 
   - For transforming a character in `baseStr`, we'll find the lexicographically smallest equivalent character using the Union-Find's find operation.

4. **Union-Find Implementation:** 
   - We'll implement path compression in the find operation and union by rank to keep the operations efficient.

## Code Implementation

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.parent = list(range(size))
    
    def find(self, x):
        if x != self.parent[x]:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])  # Path compression
        return self.parent[x]
    
    def union(self, x, y):
        rootX = self.find(x)
        rootY = self.find(y)
        if rootX != rootY:
            if rootX < rootY:
                self.parent[rootY] = rootX
            else:
                self.parent[rootX] = rootY

def smallestEquivalentString(s1, s2, baseStr):
    uf = UnionFind(26)  # For 26 lowercase English letters
    
    for char1, char2 in zip(s1, s2):
        uf.union(ord(char1) - ord('a'), ord(char2) - ord('a'))
        
    result = []
    for char in baseStr:
        smallest_char = chr(uf.find(ord(char) - ord('a')) + ord('a'))
        result.append(smallest_char)
    
    return ''.join(result)

# Example usage
s1 = "parker"
s2 = "morris"
baseStr = "parser"
print(smallestEquivalentString(s1, s2, baseStr))  # Output: "makkek"
```

## Time Complexity
- **Initialization:** Initializing the Union-Find data structure takes O(26) due to fixed size, which simplifies to O(1).
- **Union Operations:** Each union operation runs in nearly constant time, denoted as O(α(N)), where α is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows extremely slowly.
- **Find Operations:** Each find operation also runs in O(α(N)) due to path compression.
- **Overall:** The combined complexity of union and find operations across the strings is O(N * α(N)), where N is the length of the strings (specifically the length of `s1` and `s2`).
- **Result Construction:** Constructing the resulting string runs in O(M), where M is the length of `baseStr`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(N + M) with very efficient operations due to the properties of the Union-Find structure.
