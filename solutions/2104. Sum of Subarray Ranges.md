title:  Sum of Subarray Ranges-out
permalink: /s2104
---

You are given an integer array `nums`. The range of a subarray of `nums` is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum element in the subarray.

Return the sum of all subarray ranges of `nums`.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

#### Example:

```python
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3]
Output: 4
Explanation: The 6 subarrays of [1, 2, 3] are:
[1], range = 0
[2], range = 0
[3], range = 0
[1,2], range = 1
[2,3], range = 1
[1,2,3], range = 2
So the sum of all ranges is 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the array can contain negative as well as positive integers.

2. **What is the length range of the array?**
   - The array length can be from 1 to 1000.

3. **Is there any constraint on the values within the array?**
   - The values in the array can range from `-10^9` to `10^9`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we'll use a brute-force approach where we will iterate over all possible subarrays. For each subarray, find the minimum and maximum elements and calculate the range. Sum all these calculated ranges to get the final result.

1. Iterate through all possible subarrays defined by their starting and ending indices.
2. For each subarray, calculate the minimum and maximum values and thereby the range.
3. Sum up all the ranges.

### Code

```python
def subArrayRanges(nums):
    result = 0
    n = len(nums)
    
    for i in range(n):
        min_val = float('inf')
        max_val = -float('inf')
        for j in range(i, n):
            min_val = min(min_val, nums[j])
            max_val = max(max_val, nums[j])
            result += (max_val - min_val)
            
    return result

# Example Usage
nums = [1, 2, 3]
print(subArrayRanges(nums))  # Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n^2)\) because for each starting index `i`, we iterate over the array again to compute minimum and maximum values for all subarrays starting at `i`.
- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as we are not using any additional data structures that grow with the input size.

This brute-force approach is adequate given the constraint \(1 \leq \text{len(nums)} \leq 1000\), but may not be the most optimal. However, it provides a simple and clear solution to the problem.
