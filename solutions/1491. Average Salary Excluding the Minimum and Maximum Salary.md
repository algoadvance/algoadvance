title:  Average Salary Excluding the Minimum and Maximum Salary-out
permalink: /s1491

Given an array of unique integers `salary` where `salary[i]` is the salary of the ith employee, return the average salary of employees excluding the minimum and maximum salary. 

Example:
- Input: `salary = [4000, 3000, 1000, 2000]`
- Output: `2500.00000`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the maximum length of the salary array?
   - Typically, constraints are provided in coding platforms, but for now, we'll assume it could be any reasonable length fitting within typical system memory.

2. **Uniqueness**: Are all salary entries unique?
   - Yes, per the problem statement.

3. **Decimal Precision**: Is there a specific requirement for decimal precision of the output?
   - The output should typically be returned in floating point format, so ensuring up to five decimal places precision is a safe approach if not further specified.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. Remove the minimum salary from the list.
2. Remove the maximum salary from the list.
3. Calculate the average of the remaining salaries.

Here is the algorithm:
1. Sort the array.
2. Ignore the first element (minimum) and the last element (maximum).
3. Calculate the average of the remaining elements.

### Time Complexity

The sorting step will dominate the time complexity, which will be O(n log n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array. Other operations (finding the sum and average) are linear, i.e., O(n).

### Code

Here is the implementation of the strategy:

```python
def average(salary):
    # Sort the salary list to find min and max easily
    salary.sort()
    
    # Excluding the first and last element (which are min and max)
    sum_of_salaries = sum(salary[1:-1])
    count_of_salaries = len(salary) - 2
    
    # Calculating average
    return sum_of_salaries / count_of_salaries

# Example test case
salary = [4000, 3000, 1000, 2000]
print(average(salary))  # Output: 2500.0
```

By following this approach, the code efficiently excludes the minimum and maximum salaries and computes the average of the rest.
