Leetcode Problem 1189: **Maximum Number of Balloons**

Given a string `text`, you want to use the characters of `text` to form as many instances of the word **"balloon"** as possible. Each character in the string `text` can only be used once. Return the maximum number of instances that can be formed.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input:** What is the range of the length of the input string?
   - Generally, problems of this nature will have strings of length up to 10^4 or similar, but itâ€™s good to confirm.

2. **Case Sensitivity:** Should the word "balloon" be case-sensitive?
   - Assuming if "balloon" must be exactly in lower-case.

3. **Character Set:** Are the characters in `text` guaranteed to be alphabetic or could there be other types of characters?
   - Assuming the input will only contain alphabetic characters.

### Code

```python
def maxNumberOfBalloons(text: str) -> int:
    from collections import Counter
    
    # Count all characters in the input text
    count = Counter(text)
    
    # The word we need to form is "balloon"
    balloon_count = Counter("balloon")
    
    # Find the minimum number of times we can form "balloon"
    return min(count[char] // balloon_count[char] for char in balloon_count)

# Example usage
print(maxNumberOfBalloons("nlaebolko"))  # Output should be 1
print(maxNumberOfBalloons("loonbalxballpoon"))  # Output should be 2
print(maxNumberOfBalloons("leetcode"))  # Output should be 0
```

### Strategy

1. **Counting Characters:** Use Python's `collections.Counter` to count the frequency of each character in the input string `text`.
2. **Character Requirements:** Similarly, count the frequency of each character in the word "balloon".
3. **Compute Instances:** For each character in the word "balloon", determine how many times it can be used (i.e., `text_count[char] // balloon_count[char]`).

4. **Minimum Constraint:** The maximum number of "balloon"s that can be formed is limited by the least available required character based on its required frequency.

### Time Complexity

- **Character Counting:** O(n) - Where `n` is the length of the input string `text`.
- **Calculating Minimum Instances:** O(1) - As we are only iterating through the fixed set of characters in "balloon".
- **Overall Complexity:** O(n)

This solution should be efficient even for the upper limits of typical input sizes in interview scenarios.
