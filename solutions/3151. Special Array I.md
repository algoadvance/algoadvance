title:  Special Array I-out
permalink: /s3151
---
You are given a non-negative integer array `nums`. The special array is defined as an array where there exists a number `x` such that there are exactly `x` elements in the array that are greater than or equal to `x`.

Return the smallest possible value of `x`. If no such `x` exists, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of values for the elements in `nums`?**
    - The values in `nums` are non-negative integers and could be very large.
  
2. **What is the length of the array `nums`?**
    - The length of `nums` could vary from 1 to 1000.

3. **Is it important to consider edge cases like an empty array?**
    - No, since `nums` will have at least one element as per constraint 1 <= nums.length.

### Strategy
1. **Sort the Array:** 
   - Start by sorting the array `nums`. This helps in determining the number of elements greater than or equal to any number `x` efficiently.
  
2. **Iterate Through Possible Values of `x`:**
   - Iterate over the possible values of `x` from `0` to the length of the array. For each `x`, we need to check if there are exactly `x` elements greater than or equal to `x`.
   
3. **Use Binary Search Logic:**
   - For a given `x`, find the first position in the sorted array where the element is greater than or equal to `x` using binary search. 
   - The number of elements greater than or equal to `x` can then be determined by the length of the array minus this position.
    
4. **Check the Condition for Each `x`:**
   - If we find any such `x` that meets the condition, return that `x`.
   - If no such `x` is found, return `-1`.

### Code

```python
def specialArray(nums):
    nums.sort()
    n = len(nums)
    
    for x in range(n + 1):
        # Find the number of elements greater than or equal to `x`
        idx = binary_search(nums, x)
        if n - idx == x:
            return x
    return -1

def binary_search(nums, x):
    left, right = 0, len(nums)
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] >= x:
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left

# Example Usage:
nums = [3, 5, 0, 4, 3]
print(specialArray(nums))  # Output might be 3
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Sorting the Array:** 
   - The time complexity for sorting is \( O(n \log n) \).

2. **Iterating Through Possible Values of `x`:**
   - We iterate from `0` to `n`, resulting in \( O(n) \) operations.
   
3. **Binary Search for Position:**
   - Each binary search operation takes \( O(\log n) \). Since it is repeated `n+1` times, it gives \( O(n \log n) \).

Overall, the dominant factor remains the sorting step, resulting in a final time complexity of \( O(n \log n) \).

This approach ensures that we efficiently identify the smallest possible `x` or determine that no such `x` exists.
