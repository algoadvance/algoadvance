title:  Stone Game IV-out
permalink: /s1510
---

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first. Initially, there are `n` stones in a pile. On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of removing any non-zero square number of stones from the pile.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game. Given a positive integer `n`, return `true` if and only if Alice wins the game assuming both players play optimally.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 1
Output: true
Explanation: Alice can remove 1 stone and win the game. 
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 2
Output: false
Explanation: Alice will lose. She can only remove 1 stone, leaving Bob with 1 stone. Bob will then remove the last stone and win. 
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 4
Output: true
Explanation: Alice can remove 4 stones and win the game.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum value of `n`?**  
   This will help in defining the range for our solution and help in analyzing the time complexity.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the value of `n`?**  
   This helps in understanding if there are any special cases that we need to handle.

## Code

First, let's proceed to think through the problem.

## Strategy

This is a combinatorial game theory problem. The idea is to use dynamic programming to determine if Alice can win for any given number of stones `n`.

1. **Define `dp[i]` as whether the player starting with `i` stones can win or not.**
2. **Initialization:**
   - `dp[0] = False` because if there are no stones left, the player to move loses.
   - `dp[1]` should be `True`, as with 1 stone, Alice can take it and win immediately.
3. **Fill the dp array:**
   - For every `i` from `1` to `n`, check all square numbers `k^2` less than or equal to `i`. If there is a way to leave the opponent in a losing position (`dp[i - k^2] == False`), set `dp[i]` to `True`.

### Code Implementation

```python
def winnerSquareGame(n: int) -> bool:
    dp = [False] * (n + 1)
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        j = 1
        while j * j <= i:
            if not dp[i - j * j]:
                dp[i] = True
                break
            j += 1
            
    return dp[n]
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is influenced by:
- The outer loop iterating over `n` elements: `O(n)`
- The inner loop iterating over possible square numbers up to the current `i`, which takes `O(√n)` time since the highest possible square root we consider is `√n`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n√n)`.

Feel free to ask any further clarifying questions or request optimizations or further explanation if needed.
