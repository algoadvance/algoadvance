title:  Maximum Product of the Length of Two Palindromic Subsequences-out
permalink: /s2002
---
You are given a string `s`. You need to select two disjoint subsequences of `s` such that both subsequences are palindromic and the product of their lengths is maximized. Return the maximum possible product of the lengths of the two palindromic subsequences.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is a subsequence?** 
   - A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
   
2. **What is a palindromic subsequence?**
   - A palindromic subsequence is a subsequence that reads the same forwards and backwards.

3. **Can the original string contain any characters other than lowercase English letters?**
   - No, for simplicity, we will assume the string contains only lowercase English letters.

4. **What is the length range of the string `s`?**
   - The length of the string `s` is between 2 and 12 inclusive.

## Strategy
Considering the maximum length of the string `s` is 12, we can use bitwise manipulation to generate all possible subsequences and check if they are palindromic. This method allows us to systematically explore all possible pairs of palindromic subsequences.

1. **Generate Subsequences:**
   - Use bitwise operations to generate all possible subsequences.
   
2. **Check Palindromes:**
   - Create a helper function to check if a given subsequence is palindromic.
   
3. **Calculate Length Product:**
   - For each pair of subsequences, check if they are disjoint and if both are palindromic. Calculate the product of their lengths and update the maximum product.

## Code
Hereâ€™s the implementation in Python:

```python
def maxProduct(s: str) -> int:
    # Helper function to check if a subsequence is a palindrome
    def is_palindrome(subseq):
        return subseq == subseq[::-1]
    
    n = len(s)
    max_product = 0
    
    # There are 2^n possible subsequences
    for i in range(1 << n):
        for j in range(i + 1, 1 << n):
            if i & j == 0:  # i and j are disjoint
                subseq1 = [s[k] for k in range(n) if i & (1 << k)]
                subseq2 = [s[k] for k in range(n) if j & (1 << k)]
                if is_palindrome(subseq1) and is_palindrome(subseq2):
                    max_product = max(max_product, len(subseq1) * len(subseq2))
    
    return max_product

# Example use case
print(maxProduct("acdapmpomp"))  # Example input
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(2^n * 2^n * n)**, which simplifies to **O(4^n * n)**. This is because:
1. We generate **2^n** possible subsequences.
2. For every subsequence, we check all pairs (leading to 2^n * 2^n combinations).
3. For each pair, we verify palindromes which takes **O(n)**.

Given the maximum `n` is 12, this approach is feasible within practical limits for the problem constraints.
