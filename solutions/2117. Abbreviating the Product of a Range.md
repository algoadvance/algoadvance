title:  Abbreviating the Product of a Range-out
permalink: /s2117
---

Given two integers `left` and `right`, write a function to abbreviate the product of the integers in the range \([left, right]\). The abbreviated product should represent the first few and the last few digits of the actual product, concatenated with an "e" and the number of digits between them.

The specific requirements for abbreviation are:
1. The first 5 significant digits of the product.
2. The last 5 significant digits of the product.
3. Concatenated them with an 'e' and the number of digits in between.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range Validity**: Can `left` be greater than `right`, or will it always be `left <= right`?  
   **Assumption**: It is given that `left <= right`.

2. **Digits in Between**: Is this the count of digits that are not part of the first 5 or last 5 significant digits?
   **Clarification**: Yes, digits in between are the digits not shown in the abbreviation.

3. **Product Size**: What are the realistic values of `left` and `right`?
   **Assumption**: We should expect large values that would make the product computationally intensive to handle directly.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Observations**: Directly computing the product of a large range could overflow standard numerical limits or be computationally infeasible. We should handle it in segments and use logarithms to avoid overflow.

2. **First 5 Significant Digits**:
    - Use logarithmic properties to compute the leading digits.

3. **Last 5 Significant Digits**:
    - Compute and maintain the product modulo \(10^5\) to keep track of trailing digits.

4. **Digit Count**:
    - Use logarithms to determine the order (number of digits) of the product without computing the entire product.

### Code

```python
import math

def abbreviateProduct(left: int, right: int) -> str:
    # Calculate number of digits of the product in total
    total_digits = 0
    for i in range(left, right + 1):
        total_digits += math.log10(i)
    total_digits = int(total_digits) + 1

    # Calculate first 5 significant digits
    first_five_digits_log = 0
    for i in range(left, right + 1):
        first_five_digits_log += math.log10(i)
    first_five_digits = int(10 ** (first_five_digits_log - int(first_five_digits_log) + 4))
    
    # Calculate last 5 significant digits
    last_five_digits = 1
    for i in range(left, right + 1):
        last_five_digits = (last_five_digits * i) % 10**5
    
    # Compute the count of digits in between
    in_between_digits = total_digits - 10

    return f"{first_five_digits}...{last_five_digits:05d}e{in_between_digits}"

# Example usage
print(abbreviateProduct(1, 10))  # Output should be "36288...80000e0" (or similar, based on approximation precision)
```

### Time Complexity

- **Looping through the range**: The time complexity is \(O(N)\) where \(N\) is the length of the range `right - left + 1`.

- **Logarithmic computations**: Performed in constant time for each element in the range, maintaining the overall time complexity at \(O(N)\).

The above code ensures efficient calculation of the required product abbreviation without directly computing the entire product, thereby handling large ranges effectively.
