title:  Maximum Score of a Good Subarray-out
permalink: /s1793
---

Given an array `nums` (0-indexed) and an integer `k`, return the maximum possible score of a non-empty subarray of `nums` such that for every index `i` in the subarray, `i â‰¥ k`. The score of a subarray (i, j) is defined as its minimum value multiplied by its length.

### Example 1
```
Input: nums = [1,4,3,7,4,5], k = 3  
Output: 15  
Explanation: The subarray (0, 5) has a minimum value of 3 and a length of 6, so its score is 3*6 = 18.
```

### Example 2
```
Input: nums = [5,5,4,5,4,1,1,1], k = 0  
Output: 20  
Explanation: The subarray (0, 4) has a minimum value of 4 and a length of 5, so its score is 4*5 = 20.
```

### Clarifying Questions
- Can the array contain negative numbers? (Based on typical constraints, usually positive integers are expected.)
- What is the range of the size of `nums`? (Assume standard constraint around 10^5, if not mentioned otherwise.)

## Strategy

1. **Initialize pointers**: Start with pointers `left` and `right` at the position `k`.
2. **Expand Subarray**: Expand the subarray leftwards and rightwards from position `k` to include as many elements as possible while ensuring the subarray's minimum value is still competitive.
3. **Track Minimum Value**: For every expansion, track the minimum value of the subarray and calculate the score.
4. **Calculate the Score**: For each expansion, compute the score as `min_val * (right - left + 1)` and keep track of the maximum score encountered.
5. **Termination**: Continue expanding until the whole array or until further expansion cannot yield a higher score.

## Code
```python
def maximumScore(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    left = right = k
    min_val = nums[k]
    max_score = min_val
    
    # Expand outwards from k
    while left > 0 or right < n - 1:
        if left == 0:
            right += 1
        elif right == n - 1:
            left -= 1
        else:
            if nums[left - 1] > nums[right + 1]:
                left -= 1
            else:
                right += 1
        
        min_val = min(min_val, nums[left], nums[right])
        max_score = max(max_score, min_val * (right - left + 1))
    
    return max_score
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - We traverse the array starting from the `k` position outwards to the boundaries of the array, ensuring we consider all possible subarrays containing `k`.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We are not using any additional space that grows with input size, just a few pointers and variables.
