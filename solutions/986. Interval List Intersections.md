title:  Interval List Intersections-out
permalink: /s986
---

You are given two lists of closed intervals, `firstList` and `secondList`, where `firstList[i] = [starti, endi]` and `secondList[j] = [startj, endj]`. Each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.

Return the intersection of these two interval lists.

An interval `[a, b]` (with `a <= b`) represents the set of real numbers `x` such that `a <= x <= b`.

The intersection of two intervals `a = [a1, a2]` and `b = [b1, b2]` is `[max(a1, b1), min(a2, b2)]`. A pair of intervals intersect if and only if `max(a1, b1) <= min(a2, b2)`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Clarification on Input:** Are both interval lists guaranteed to be sorted in non-decreasing order?
   - **Yes**.
2. **Handling Edge Cases:** How do we handle cases where intersecting intervals result in an empty set or where either list is empty?
   - **For intersections that result in an empty set, they should be ignored. If either list is empty, return an empty list**.

### Strategy

1. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, to zero. These pointers will iterate over `firstList` and `secondList`, respectively.
2. Use a while loop to ensure both pointers are within the bounds of their respective lists.
3. For each interval pair `[start1, end1]` in `firstList` and `[start2, end2]` in `secondList`, do the following:
   - Find the intersection of these intervals by computing the maximum start and the minimum end.
   - If the computed intersection is valid (i.e., `start_max <= end_min`), add it to the result list.
4. Move to the next interval in the list which has the smallest end value to ensure we are moving towards finding new potential intersections.
5. Continue until one of the lists is exhausted.

### Time Complexity

The solution will have a time complexity of \(O(N + M)\), where \(N\) is the length of `firstList` and \(M\) is the length of `secondList`, since each interval is processed at most once.

### Code

```python
def intervalIntersection(firstList, secondList):
    i, j = 0  # Initialize pointers for both lists
    intersections = []  # This will store our result of intersections

    while i < len(firstList) and j < len(secondList):
        # Get the start and end points for the current intervals
        start1, end1 = firstList[i]
        start2, end2 = secondList[j]

        # Calculate the start and end of the intersection
        start_max = max(start1, start2)
        end_min = min(end1, end2)

        # Check if we actually have an intersection
        if start_max <= end_min:
            intersections.append([start_max, end_min])
        
        # Move the pointer of the interval list that had the smallest endpoint
        if end1 < end2:
            i += 1
        else:
            j += 1

    return intersections

# Example Test Case
firstList = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]]
secondList = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]
print(intervalIntersection(firstList, secondList))
# Expected Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]
```

This code defines a function `intervalIntersection` that takes two lists of intervals and returns their intersections. The function uses two pointers to iterate over the lists, calculates intersections, and appends valid intersections to the result list.
