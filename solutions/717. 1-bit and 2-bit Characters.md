title:  1-bit and 2-bit Characters-out
permalink: /s717
---

We have two special characters:

- `1-bit character` which is represented by a single `0`.
- `2-bit character` which is represented by either `10` or `11`.

Given a binary array `bits` ending with a `0`, you need to determine if the last character must be a `1-bit character` or not. The task is to return `True` if the last character can only be a `1-bit character` and `False` otherwise.

### Example 1:
- Input: `bits = [1, 0, 0]`
- Output: `True`
- Explanation: The only way to decode it is `10, 0` where the last '0' is a `1-bit character`.

### Example 2:
- Input: `bits = [1, 1, 1, 0]`
- Output: `False`
- Explanation: The only way to decode it is `11, 10` where the last '0' is part of the `2-bit character '10'`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the array be empty?
   - No, as per the problem the array ends with a `0` which means there is at least one element.
2. Can there be other characters besides `0` and `1`?
   - No, the array strictly consists of binary digits `0` and `1` as given in the problem.
3. Should we always assume that the input array is valid given the problem constraints?
   - Yes, we assume that the constraints ensure a valid input.

## Strategy

1. We need to decode the given binary array `bits` following the decoding rules (`1-bit` or `2-bit`).
2. Initialize an index `i` and iterate through the array from the start.
3. If the current bit is a `1`, increment the index `i` by 2 because `1` can only be part of a `2-bit` character (`10` or `11`).
4. If the current bit is `0`, increment the index `i` by 1 because `0` represents a `1-bit` character.
5. Finally, check if at the end of the iteration, `i` is exactly at the last element. If yes, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

By this logic, we can ensure that the last character is checked correctly based on the decoding rules.

## Code

```python
def isOneBitCharacter(bits):
    i = 0
    while i < len(bits) - 1:  # Traverse until the second last element
        if bits[i] == 1:
            i += 2
        else:
            i += 1
    # If we end at the last element, it means it's a 1-bit character
    return i == len(bits) - 1

# Example Usage
print(isOneBitCharacter([1, 0, 0]))  # True
print(isOneBitCharacter([1, 1, 1, 0]))  # False
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input array `bits`. This is because we are making a single pass through the array, looking at each element at least once.

The space complexity is `O(1)` because we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
