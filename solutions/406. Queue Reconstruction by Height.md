title:  Queue Reconstruction by Height-out
permalink: /s406
---

You are given an array of people, `people`, which represents the attributes of `n` people in a queue (not necessarily in the correct order). Each `people[i] = [hi, ki]` represents the ith person of height `hi` with `ki` people in front of them who have a height greater than or equal to `hi`.

Reconstruct and return the queue that is represented by the input array `people`. The queue is returned in the format of an array of the same length as `people` where the `jth` person in the queue is denoted as `queue[j] = [hj, kj]`.

### Example
**Example 1:**
```
Input: people = [[7, 0], [4, 4], [7, 1], [5, 0], [6, 1], [5, 2]]
Output: [[5, 0], [7, 0], [5, 2], [6, 1], [4, 4], [7, 1]]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: people = [[6, 0], [5, 0], [4, 0], [3, 2], [2, 2], [1, 4]]
Output: [[4, 0], [5, 0], [2, 2], [3, 2], [1, 4], [6, 0]]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: Can there be multiple people with the same height and `k` value?**
   A: Yes, it is possible for multiple people to have the same height and `k` value.
   
2. **Q: Can the array contain people with non-positive heights or negative values for `k`?**
   A: No, according to the problem constraints, heights are positive integers and `k` is a non-negative integer.
   
3. **Q: Is the input guaranteed to be valid and formable into a queue?**
   A: Yes, the input is always valid and can be reconstructed into a queue.

## Strategy

1. **Sort the `people` array**: 
   - First by height in descending order.
   - Within the same height, by `k` value in ascending order.
   
2. **Insert each person into the queue**:
   - Initialize an empty list to represent the queue.
   - Iterate over the sorted list and insert each person into the `k` index of the current queue. This places the current person at the position such that there are exactly `k` people in front of themselves who are at least as tall.

By sorting in this specified manner, we ensure that when we insert each person by their `k` value, the remaining list is always valid and maintains the required order.

## Code
```python
def reconstructQueue(people):
    # Sort the people: first by height in descending order, 
    # and by number of people in front (k) in ascending order for those with the same height.
    people.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[0], x[1]))
    
    queue = []
    # Insert each person into the queue based on the k value
    for person in people:
        queue.insert(person[1], person)
        
    return queue

# Example usage:
people = [[7, 0], [4, 4], [7, 1], [5, 0], [6, 1], [5, 2]]
print(reconstructQueue(people))  # Output: [[5, 0], [7, 0], [5, 2], [6, 1], [4, 4], [7, 1]]
```

## Time Complexity

- Sorting the array takes \(O(n \log n)\) where `n` is the number of people.
- Inserting each person into the queue is \(O(n^2)\) in the worst case because each insertion could potentially involve shifting all elements.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of this solution is \(O(n^2)\).
