### 2789. Largest Element in an Array after Merge Operations

You are given an array of positive integers `nums`. You can perform the following operation any number of times:

1. **Merge operation**: Choose any two adjacent elements in `nums` and replace them with their sum.

Return the value of the largest element that you can possibly obtain in the array after any number of merge operations.

### Example:
```
Input: nums = [2,3,7,9,3]
Output: 24
Explanation: After merging all elements into a single one, the best result is 24.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the numbers be negative?**
   - No, they are positive integers.

2. **Are there any constraints on the size of the array?**
   - The size and values of `nums` will fit within the usual LeetCode constraints for array problems.

3. **Is there any specific condition on choosing the pairs to merge, or can we choose any adjacent elements?**
   - We can choose any adjacent elements to merge.

Given these points, let's proceed to the solution.

## Strategy

To maximize the single element, the strategy is straightforward:
1. Sum all elements in the array. The sum will be the maximum value that can be obtained because as we perform merge operations, we effectively add all elements.

## Code

```python
def largest_element_after_merge(nums):
    return sum(nums)

# Example Usage
nums = [2, 3, 7, 9, 3]
print(largest_element_after_merge(nums))  # Output: 24
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - Summing all elements in the array takes linear time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We only use a constant amount of extra space.

This approach provides the largest possible single element efficiently.
