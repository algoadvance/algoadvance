title:  Number of Substrings With Only 1s-out
permalink: /s1513
---
Given a binary string `s`, return the number of substrings with all characters `1`s. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Clarifying Questions
- **Q**: What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
  - **A**: The length of `s` can be up to `10^5`.
- **Q**: Will the string contain only the characters '0' and '1'?
  - **A**: Yes, it's a binary string with only '0's and '1's.
- **Q**: What should we return if the string contains no '1's?
  - **A**: If there are no '1's, the result should be `0`.

## Strategy
1. **Identify Segments of '1's:**
   - Traverse the string and identify contiguous segments of '1's.
   
2. **Calculate the Substrings:**
   - For each segment of consecutive '1's of length `n`, the number of substrings is given by the sum of first `n` natural numbers: \(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n = \frac{n(n+1)}{2}\).
   
3. **Sum Results for All Segments:**
   - Sum up the counts for all segments of '1's found.

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Since the result can be large, take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Code
```python
def numSub(s: str) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    count = 0
    length = 0
    
    for char in s:
        if char == '1':
            length += 1  # increment the length of the current segment of '1's
        else:
            # End of a segment, calculate the number of substrings and reset length
            count += (length * (length + 1)) // 2
            count %= MOD  # take modulo at each step to prevent overflow
            length = 0
    
    # To account for the last segment if it was '1's
    if length > 0:
        count += (length * (length + 1)) // 2
        count %= MOD
    
    return count

# Example usage:
# s = "0110111"
# print(numSub(s))  # Output: 9
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`. We traverse the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as we use a constant amount of extra space.

By following this strategy, we can efficiently count the number of substrings with only '1's in a binary string.
