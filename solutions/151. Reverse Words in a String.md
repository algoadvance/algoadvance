title:  Reverse Words in a String-out
permalink: /s151
---
Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the words.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order, concatenated by a single space.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"
Explanation: Your reversed string should not contain leading or trailing spaces.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
Explanation: You need to reduce multiple spaces between two words to a single space in the reversed string.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Should leading or trailing spaces be removed?**
   - Yes, they should be removed in the output.
2. **How should multiple spaces between words be handled?**
   - They should be reduced to a single space.
3. **What about empty strings or strings with only spaces?**
   - They should return an empty string.

### Strategy
1. **Strip the string:** Remove any leading or trailing whitespace.
2. **Split the string by spaces:** This will give us a list of words. Python's `split()` method will handle multiple spaces by default.
3. **Reverse the list of words.**
4. **Join the reversed list with a single space.**
5. **Return the result.**

### Code
```python
def reverseWords(s: str) -> str:
    # Step 1: Strip the string to remove any leading or trailing spaces
    trimmed = s.strip()
    
    # Step 2: Split the string by spaces, which will also handle multiple spaces
    words = trimmed.split()
    
    # Step 3: Reverse the list of words
    words.reverse()
    
    # Step 4: Join the reversed list with a single space
    result = ' '.join(words)
    
    return result

# Test cases
print(reverseWords("the sky is blue"))  # Output: "blue is sky the"
print(reverseWords("  hello world  "))  # Output: "world hello"
print(reverseWords("a good   example"))  # Output: "example good a"
print(reverseWords("    "))  # Output: ""
print(reverseWords(""))  # Output: ""
```

### Time Complexity
- **Stripping and Splitting:** Both operations are O(n), where n is the length of the string.
- **Reversing the List:** O(k), where k is the number of words (in the worst case, k can be at most n if every character is a single word followed by a space).
- **Joining the List:** O(n).

Overall, the time complexity for this approach is O(n). 

### Summary
This solution efficiently reverses the words in a string by leveraging Python's built-in string handling capabilities. It ensures correct handling of leading/trailing spaces and multiple spaces between words, providing a clean and effective solution.
