title:  Minimum Length of Anagram Concatenation-out
permalink: /s3138
---

You are given a string `s` and a list of words `words` where each word is an anagram of each other. Your task is to find the minimum length of a substring `t` of `s` such that any permutation of the concatenation of the `words` forms an anagram of `t`.

In simpler terms, you are given a string and a set of words which are anagrams of each other. You need to find the smallest substring of the given string that contains all the characters in any permutation of the concatenation of the words from the list.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the length of `s` and the number of words in `words`?**
   - Yes, typical constraints can be assumed as \( 1 \leq |s| \leq 10^5 \) and \( 1 \leq \text{len(words)} \leq 10^3 \).

2. **Can the words list be empty or contain empty strings?**
   - No, you can assume the list of words is non-empty, and each word is non-empty.

3. **Is the list of words guaranteed to be non-repetitive, or can it contain duplicates?**
   - This needs to be clarified but for now, we will assume it may contain duplicates since all are anagrams of each other.

4. **What is the character set of the string and words?**
   - The string `s` and words are composed of lowercase English letters `'a'` to `'z'`.

## Strategy

1. **Concatenate the Words and Calculate Frequency:**
   - Concatenate all the words together to form a single string. Compute the frequency of each character in this concatenated string.

2. **Sliding Window Approach:**
   - Use a sliding window approach to find the smallest substring in `s` which matches the calculated frequency of characters.
   - Utilize two pointers to maintain a sliding window to cover each character in `s`.

3. **Maintain Character Count:**
   - Use a dictionary to maintain the count of characters within the current sliding window and compare it with the required frequency.

4. **Optimize the Window:**
   - Continuously adjust the start and end pointers of the window to ensure it contains all the necessary characters in the correct frequency and try to minimize the window size.

## Code

```python
from collections import Counter, defaultdict

def min_length_of_anagram_concatenation(s: str, words: list[str]) -> int:
    if not s or not words:
        return 0
    
    # Concatenate all words into a single string
    concatenated = "".join(words)
    
    # If the concatenated length is more than s, no solution
    if len(concatenated) > len(s):
        return -1
    
    # Count the frequency of each character in the concatenated words
    required_freq = Counter(concatenated)
    required_len = len(concatenated)
    
    # Variable to store the minimum length of the required substring
    min_len = float('inf')
    
    # Current window frequency count
    window_freq = defaultdict(int)
    left = 0
    matched = 0
    
    # Use a sliding window to traverse the string `s`
    for right in range(len(s)):
        char = s[right]
        window_freq[char] += 1
        
        if window_freq[char] <= required_freq[char]:
            matched += 1
        
        # If we've matched all characters, try to minimize the window
        while matched == required_len:
            min_len = min(min_len, right - left + 1)
            left_char = s[left]
            window_freq[left_char] -= 1
            if window_freq[left_char] < required_freq[left_char]:
                matched -= 1
            left += 1
    
    return min_len if min_len != float('inf') else -1

# Example Usage:
s = "bcabcabbac"
words = ["abc", "cab"]

print(min_length_of_anagram_concatenation(s, words))  # Expected Output: 6
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`. This is because each character is processed at most twice (once by the right pointer and once by the left pointer).
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) for the window and required frequency as the character set size is fixed (26 lowercase English letters).

This approach ensures optimal performance in terms of time complexity while ensuring all edge cases (e.g., no valid substring) are handled appropriately.
