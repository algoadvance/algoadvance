title:  Paths in Matrix Whose Sum Is Divisible by K-out
permalink: /s2435
---

You are given a `m x n` integer matrix `grid` and an integer `k`. You are tasked with finding the number of paths from the top-left corner of the grid to the bottom-right corner of the grid such that the sum of the elements along the path is divisible by `k`. You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can the path revisit cells?
   - **A**: No, you can only move down or right, revisiting cells is not allowed.
   
2. **Q**: What should be returned when no such path exists?
   - **A**: Return 0.
   
3. **Q**: Are the matrix dimensions always greater than 0?
   - **A**: Yes, you can assume that the grid is a non-empty matrix.
   
4. **Q**: What is the range of values for the elements in the matrix and for `k`?
   - **A**: Typical constraints could be 1 ≤ grid[i][j], k ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m, n ≤ 50.

### Strategy

This problem can be approached using dynamic programming due to overlapping subproblems. We'll maintain a 3D list `dp` where `dp[i][j][mod]` will store the number of ways to reach cell `(i, j)` such that the sum modulo `k` equals `mod`.

#### Steps:
1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing a 3D DP table where `dp[0][0][grid[0][0] % k] = 1`.
2. **DP Transition**:
   - For each cell `(i, j)` in the grid:
     - If moving from the top:
       ```dp[i][j][(mod + grid[i][j]) % k] += dp[i-1][j][mod]```
     - If moving from the left:
       ```dp[i][j][(mod + grid[i][j]) % k] += dp[i][j-1][mod]```
3. **Final Computation**: The answer will be in `dp[m-1][n-1][0]` which represents the number of ways to reach the bottom-right corner with a sum that is divisible by `k`.

### Code

```python
def numberOfPaths(grid, k):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    
    # Initialize the DP table
    dp = [[[0] * k for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]
    
    # Initialize the starting point
    dp[0][0][grid[0][0] % k] = 1
    
    # Iterate through the grid
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            for mod in range(k):
                if i > 0:
                    dp[i][j][(mod + grid[i][j]) % k] += dp[i-1][j][mod]
                if j > 0:
                    dp[i][j][(mod + grid[i][j]) % k] += dp[i][j-1][mod]
    
    # Result is the number of ways to reach the bottom-right corner with sum % k == 0
    return dp[m-1][n-1][0]

# Example usage:
grid = [[5,2,4],[3,0,5],[0,7,2]]
k = 3
print(numberOfPaths(grid, k))  # Should output the number of valid paths
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: O(m * n * k) to create and initialize the DP array.
- **DP Transition**: O(m * n * k) because for each cell we process `k` possible remainders.
- **Final Computation**: O(1), a simple lookup.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(m * n * k).
