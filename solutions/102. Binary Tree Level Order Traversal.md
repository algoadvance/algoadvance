title:  Binary Tree Level Order Traversal-out
permalink: /s102
---

Given the root of a binary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

### Example

#### Example 1:

Input:
```
       3
      / \
     9   20
        /  \
       15   7
```
Output: `[[3], [9, 20], [15, 7]]`

#### Example 2:

Input:
```
    1
   / \
  2   3
 / \
4   5
```
Output: `[[1], [2, 3], [4, 5]]`

#### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 2000]`.
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What if the tree is empty?**
   - If the tree is empty, the root node will be `None`, and the function should return an empty list `[]`.

2. **Are there any specific conditions on the tree structure?**
   - No, the tree can be any binary tree without additional constraints.

3. **Should the result list of lists maintain the order of elements as they appear at each level?**
   - Yes, the order of elements should be from left to right for each level.

## Strategy

To achieve a level order traversal, we can use a **queue** data structure to perform a breadth-first search (BFS). The BFS approach will help in processing nodes level by level from left to right. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Initialization**:
   - If the root is `None`, return an empty list `[]`.
   - Initialize an empty list `result` to store the level order traversal.
   - Use a queue initialized with the root node.

2. **Iteration**:
   - While the queue is not empty:
     - Determine the number of nodes at the current level (`level_size`).
     - Initialize an empty list `current_level` to store the values of nodes at the current level.
     - For each node at the current level:
       - Pop the node from the front of the queue.
       - Append its value to `current_level`.
       - Add its left and right children (if they exist) to the queue.
     - Append `current_level` to `result`.

3. **Return the result**:
   - Once the queue is empty, return `result` containing the level order traversal.

## Code

```python
from collections import deque
from typing import List, Optional

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def levelOrder(root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[List[int]]:
    if not root:
        return []
    
    result = []
    queue = deque([root])
    
    while queue:
        level_size = len(queue)
        current_level = []
        
        for _ in range(level_size):
            node = queue.popleft()
            current_level.append(node.val)
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)
        
        result.append(current_level)
    
    return result
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree. Every node is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), for the use of the queue. In the worst case, the queue will store all nodes at the deepest level, which can be up to N/2 nodes in a complete binary tree. The space required for the result list is also O(N).
