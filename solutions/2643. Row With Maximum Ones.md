title:  Row With Maximum Ones-out
permalink: /s2643
---
You are given a matrix `mat` with integers `0` and `1`, where each row is sorted in non-decreasing order. Your task is to find the row with the maximum number of 1's. If there are multiple such rows, return the one with the smallest index.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Specifications**:
   - What are the dimensions of the matrix (number of rows and columns)?
   - Are the elements strictly binary (0s and 1s)?

2. **Output Specifications**:
   - What should be returned if there are multiple rows with the same maximum number of 1's?
   - Should there be any specific formatting for the output?

Assuming:
- The matrix dimensions are reasonably large.
- Each element in the matrix is either 0 or 1.
- Return the index of the row with the maximum 1's. If there's a tie, return the smallest index.

### Strategy
1. **Initialization**:
   - Start by defining two variables: `max_ones` to keep track of the maximum number of 1's found so far, and `row_index` to store the index of the row with the maximum 1's.

2. **Iterate Through Each Row**:
   - For each row, count the number of 1's.
   - Compare this count with `max_ones`. If the current row has more 1's, update `max_ones` and `row_index`.

3. **Binary Search Optimization (Optional)**:
   - Since rows are sorted, you could potentially use binary search to find the first appearance of 1 in each row, which would optimize the counting process to O(log n) per row.

4. **Result**:
   - After iterating through all rows, return `row_index`.

### Code

```python
def rowWithMaxOnes(mat):
    max_ones = -1
    row_index = -1
    
    for idx, row in enumerate(mat):
        count_of_ones = sum(row)
        if count_of_ones > max_ones:
            max_ones = count_of_ones
            row_index = idx
            
    return row_index
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initial Version**:
  - Counting 1's in each row takes O(n) where n is the number of columns.
  - With m rows, the overall time complexity is O(m * n).

- **Optimized Version (Using Binary Search)**:
  - For each row, finding the first 1 using binary search takes O(log n).
  - Therefore, for m rows, the overall time complexity would be O(m * log n).

### Testing
Make sure to test with varied cases including:
1. All 0s matrix.
2. All 1s matrix.
3. Matrices with different row and column lengths to ensure it handles all input sizes correctly.
