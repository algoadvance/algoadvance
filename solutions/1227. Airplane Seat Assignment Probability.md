title:  Airplane Seat Assignment Probability-out
permalink: /s1227

There are `n` passengers boarding an airplane with exactly `n` seats. The first passenger has lost the ticket and picks a seat randomly. But after that, the rest of the passengers will:

- Take their own seat if it is still available,
- Pick other seats randomly from the remaining ones when they find their seat already occupied.

Return the probability that the n-th person gets his own seat.

Example:
- Input: `n = 1`
- Output: `1.00000`

- Input: `n = 2`
- Output: `0.50000`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of `n`? (e.g., 1 <= n <= 10^9)
   
2. **Precision of Output:**
   - How many decimal places should the output be formatted to? (often specified in such problems)

Let's proceed with the given problem statement.

### Strategy

We need to determine the probability that the n-th person gets their own seat. The problem can be broken down through the concept of recursive probability and symmetry in choices:

- For `n = 1`, the first passenger is the only passenger, so they will always sit in their own seat, hence the probability is `1`.

- For `n = 2`, the situation is simple:
  - The first passenger chooses either their own seat (probability 1/2) or the second passenger's seat (probability 1/2).
  - If the first passenger picks their own seat, the second passenger will definitely have their own seat.
  - If the first passenger picks the second passenger's seat, the second passenger has no choice but to sit in the first passenger's seat.

Let's consider the general case for `n`:

- When the first passenger picks a random seat, there are `n` choices. Only one choice (picking their own seat) will ensure all others end up in the correct seat.
- If the first passenger picks another passenger's seat (say `k-th` seat), it turns into a subproblem of arranging `n-1` passengers where the `k-th` seat problem reduces to `n-1` seat scenario.

The recursive insight is that eventually, it boils down to a formula where the problem exhibits a convergence:

**Key Insight:**
For large `n`, the probability converges to `0.5`.

To prove this recursively:
- If `n = 1`: P(1) = 1
- If `n = 2`: P(2) = 0.5
- For `n > 2`, it can be shown that the probability `P(n)` remains 0.5 due to symmetry and the equal likelihood of jumps in intermediate steps.

### Code

```python
def nth_person_gets_nth_seat(n: int) -> float:
    if n == 1:
        return 1.0
    else:
        return 0.5

# Testing the function
print(nth_person_gets_nth_seat(1)) # Should return 1.0
print(nth_person_gets_nth_seat(2)) # Should return 0.5
print(nth_person_gets_nth_seat(100)) # Should return 0.5
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this function is **O(1)** since it consists of a simple condition check and immediate return value without performing any iterations or recursive calls beyond the base check.

This efficiency is due to the inherent nature of the probability involving symmetry which allows for a constant time solution irrespective of `n`.
