title:  Range Frequency Queries-out
permalink: /s2080
---
You are given an integer array `arr` and a 2D array `queries` where `queries[i] = [left_i, right_i, value_i]`. Each query asks for the number of times `value_i` appears in the subarray `arr[left_i...right_i]`.

Implement a class `RangeFreqQuery`:
- `RangeFreqQuery(int[] arr)` constructs an instance of the class with the given integer array `arr`.
- `int query(int left, int right, int value)` returns the number of times `value` appears in the subarray `arr[left...right]`.

### Example:
```python
arr = [1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1]
queries = [[0, 3, 1], [1, 4, 3], [2, 5, 1]]

obj = RangeFreqQuery(arr)
print(obj.query(0, 3, 1)) # Output: 2
print(obj.query(1, 4, 3)) # Output: 1
print(obj.query(2, 5, 1)) # Output: 2
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= arr[i], value <= 10^4`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`
- `queries[i].length == 3`
- `0 <= left_i <= right_i < arr.length`

---

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can multiple queries be processed simultaneously to optimize?
2. Are there any performance constraints or preferred methods for handling large queries efficiently?
3. How should we deal with edge cases, such as when the `arr` is empty or the `left` and `right` indices are the same?

---

## Strategy
To efficiently handle range frequency queries, we can preprocess the array to map each value to its positions. With this preprocessing, we can use binary search to quickly count the occurrences of a value in any given range.

### Steps:
1. **Preprocess the Array**: Create a dictionary where each key is a value in `arr`, and the value is a list of indices where the key appears.
2. **Binary Search for Query**: For each query, use binary search to find the range of indices of the value in the specified subarray.

### Methods:
- `__init__`: Preprocess the array.
- `query`: Use binary search to find the frequency of the value within the specified range.

## Time Complexity
- **Initialization (Preprocessing)**: `O(N)`, where `N` is the length of `arr`.
- **Query**: `O(log(K))`, where `K` is the number of occurrences of `value` in the array due to the binary search.

## Code Implementation
```python
from bisect import bisect_left, bisect_right
from collections import defaultdict

class RangeFreqQuery:
    def __init__(self, arr):
        self.freq_map = defaultdict(list)
        for idx, value in enumerate(arr):
            self.freq_map[value].append(idx)

    def query(self, left, right, value):
        if value not in self.freq_map:
            return 0
        positions = self.freq_map[value]
        left_pos = bisect_left(positions, left)
        right_pos = bisect_right(positions, right) - 1
        if left_pos > right_pos:
            return 0
        return (right_pos - left_pos + 1)

# Example usage:
arr = [1, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1]
queries = [[0, 3, 1], [1, 4, 3], [2, 5, 1]]

obj = RangeFreqQuery(arr)
print(obj.query(0, 3, 1))  # Output: 2
print(obj.query(1, 4, 3))  # Output: 1
print(obj.query(2, 5, 1))  # Output: 2
```

By following this approach, we can efficiently handle a large number of queries on the array.
