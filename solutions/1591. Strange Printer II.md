title:  Strange Printer II-out
permalink: /s1591
---

The problem involves a strange printer which will print a rectangular pattern on paper. Given the rectangular grid, the task is to check whether this pattern can be printed by applying certain rules.

You are given a m x n integer matrix `targetGrid` representing the pattern. The strange printer can print a pattern by following these rules:

1. The printer can print a solid horizontal segment of the same color.
2. The printer can print a solid vertical segment of the same color.
3. The printer can choose the sequence of printing tasks arbitrarily.
   
Return `True` if it is possible to print the target grid using the given rules, otherwise return `False`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the grid contain negative numbers or zeros?**
   - No, the grid only contains positive integers representing different colors.
   
2. **Can we assume that the input grid has at least one color?**
   - Yes, the grid will always have at least one cell filled with a color.

3. **Is there any limit to the size of the grid (m, n)?**
   - The grid size can be up to 60x60.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Constraints:**
   - For every distinct color in the grid, identify its bounding box (smallest rectangle that can contain all pixels of that color).
   
2. **Validation:**
   - We need to check if for each color, within its bounding box, no other colors exist.

3. **Feasibility:**
   - Check if collectively all colors in `targetGrid` satisfy the constraint for the given printing rules.

4. **Order of Operations:**
   - Perform a topological sort based on dependencies inferred from bounding boxes of overlapping colors to determine if a valid printing sequence exists.

### Code

```python
def isPrintable(targetGrid):
    from collections import deque, defaultdict
    m, n = len(targetGrid), len(targetGrid[0])
    
    colors = defaultdict(list)
    
    # Step 1: Record min and max row and column indices for each color
    positions = {}
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            c = targetGrid[i][j]
            if c not in positions:
                positions[c] = [m, n, 0, 0]
            positions[c][0] = min(positions[c][0], i)
            positions[c][1] = min(positions[c][1], j)
            positions[c][2] = max(positions[c][2], i)
            positions[c][3] = max(positions[c][3], j)
    
    # Step 2: Create the adjacency list for topological sorting
    adj = defaultdict(set)
    in_degree = defaultdict(int)
    
    for color, (r1, c1, r2, c2) in positions.items():
        for i in range(r1, r2 + 1):
            for j in range(c1, c2 + 1):
                if targetGrid[i][j] != color:
                    if color not in adj[targetGrid[i][j]]:
                        adj[targetGrid[i][j]].add(color)
                        in_degree[color] += 1
    
    # Step 3: Perform topological sort
    zero_in_degree = deque([color for color in positions if in_degree[color] == 0])
    painted_colors = 0
    
    while zero_in_degree:
        color = zero_in_degree.popleft()
        painted_colors += 1
        for neighbor in adj[color]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                zero_in_degree.append(neighbor)
    
    # If the number of painted colors equals the number of distinct colors, return True
    return painted_colors == len(positions)

# Example usage:
targetGrid = [
    [1,1,1,1],
    [1,2,2,1],
    [1,2,2,1],
    [1,1,1,1]
]
print(isPrintable(targetGrid))  # Should return True
```

### Time Complexity

- **Bounding Boxes Calculation:** \(O(m \times n)\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are the dimensions of the grid.
- **Dependency Graph Construction:** Another \(O(m \times n)\).
- **Topological Sort:** \(O(V + E)\), where \(V\) is the number of distinct colors and \(E\) is the number of edges in the dependency graph.

Since \(V\) is limited to at most 60 (given the grid can be 60x60 and each cell can be a different color maximum), and \(E\) can be at most \(V^2\), the time complexity is effectively \(O(m \times n)\), which is efficient.
