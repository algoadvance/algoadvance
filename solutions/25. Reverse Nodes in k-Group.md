title:  Reverse Nodes in k-Group-out
permalink: /s25
---

Given a linked list, reverse the nodes of a linked list k at a time and return its modified list. k is a positive integer and is less than or equal to the length of the linked list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of k, then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

**Example:**
```
Given this linked list: 1->2->3->4->5

For k = 2, you should return: 2->1->4->3->5

For k = 3, you should return: 3->2->1->4->5
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the k value always valid (1 ≤ k ≤ length of the list)?**
   - Yes, you can assume k is always valid.

2. **Should I consider edge cases where the linked list is empty?**
   - Yes, if the linked list is empty, the result should also be an empty list.

3. **What should I do if there are not enough nodes to reverse in the final group?**
   - If there are fewer nodes left than k in the end, they should remain as is.

### Strategy

1. **Helper Function for Reversing k Nodes:**
   - Create a function to reverse k nodes in the linked list.
   
2. **Iterate Through the List:**
   - Use a loop to iterate through the linked list and reverse every k nodes group-by-group.
   
3. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - Check situations where the number of nodes left is fewer than k and handle accordingly without reversing.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the solution to the problem:

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def reverseKGroup(head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
    # Function to reverse the linked list
    def reverseLinkedList(head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
        new_head, ptr = None, head
        while k:
            next_node = ptr.next
            ptr.next = new_head
            new_head = ptr
            ptr = next_node
            k -= 1
        return new_head
    
    count = 0
    ptr = head
    
    # First, check if there are at least k nodes left in the linked list.
    while count < k and ptr:
        ptr = ptr.next
        count += 1
    
    # If we have k nodes, then we reverse them
    if count == k:
        # Reverse first k nodes of the linked list
        reversed_head = reverseLinkedList(head, k)
        
        # Recurse on the remaining linked list
        # Since head is the new tail of the reversed sublist, we need to connect it to the result of reverseKGroup
        head.next = reverseKGroup(ptr, k)
        
        return reversed_head
    
    return head

# Example usage:
# Create a linked list 1->2->3->4->5 and test for k = 2 or k = 3 scenarios.
```

### Time Complexity

- **Reversing Group of k Nodes**: O(k)
- **Checking and Recursion Through the List**: If there are n nodes and we are reversing them in chunks of k, the recursion would be approximately O(n).

Thus, the overall time complexity of this approach is **O(n)**, where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the recursion stack.
