title:  Longest Increasing Subsequence II-out
permalink: /s2407
---

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

Find the maximum length of a subsequence of `nums` that is strictly increasing and the difference between adjacent elements in the subsequence is at most `k`.

A subsequence is defined as a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

## Clarifying Questions

To ensure I understand the problem correctly, I will ask the following clarifying questions:

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What is the range of the integers in the array `nums`? 
    - What is the range of the integer `k`?
    - Do we need to handle edge cases like an empty array?

2. **Output:**
    - Should the function return the length of the longest subsequence?

Let's assume the following for the purpose of implementation:
- Elements in `nums` are integers in the range `[-10^5, 10^5]`.
- `k` is a non-negative integer in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
- We should return the length of the longest increasing subsequence with the given constraints.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming with a segment tree (or a balanced binary search tree) to efficiently fetch the length of the longest subsequence that we can extend with a current number. Here are the steps:

1. **Initialization:**
    - Create a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`.
    - Create a segment tree to keep track of the maximum value of `dp[j]` for a range of indices in `nums`.

2. **Update DP Array:**
    - For each element in `nums`, use the segment tree to find the maximum `dp[j]` for previous elements `j` where the difference is at most `k`.
    - Update `dp[i]` based on this maximum value.

3. **Update Segment Tree:**
    - After calculating `dp[i]`, update the segment tree with the value of `dp[i]` to help calculate future values.

4. **Result:**
    - The answer will be the maximum value in the `dp` array.

## Code

Here is a possible implementation of the solution:

```python
class SegmentTree:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.size = size
        self.tree = [0] * (2 * size)
    
    def update(self, idx, value):
        idx += self.size
        self.tree[idx] = value
        while idx > 1:
            idx //= 2
            self.tree[idx] = max(self.tree[2 * idx], self.tree[2 * idx + 1])
    
    def range_max(self, left, right):
        left += self.size
        right += self.size
        max_value = 0
        while left < right:
            if left % 2:
                max_value = max(max_value, self.tree[left])
                left += 1
            if right % 2:
                right -= 1
                max_value = max(max_value, self.tree[right])
            left //= 2
            right //= 2
        return max_value

def lengthOfLIS(nums, k):
    if not nums:
        return 0

    offset = 10**5
    segment_tree = SegmentTree(2 * offset + 1)
    dp = [0] * len(nums)
    answer = 0

    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        left = max(0, num - k + offset)
        right = min(2 * offset, num + k + offset)
        max_prev_len = segment_tree.range_max(left, right + 1)
        dp[i] = max_prev_len + 1
        segment_tree.update(num + offset, dp[i])
        answer = max(answer, dp[i])

    return answer

# Example Usage
nums = [4, 2, 1, 5, 3]
k = 2
print(lengthOfLIS(nums, k))  # Should output the length of the longest increasing subsequence
```

## Time Complexity

- Building the Segment Tree: \(O(n)\)
- Segment Tree update and query operations cost \(O(\log M)\), where \(M\) is the range of possible values (2 * offset + 1).
- The overall time complexity is \(O(n \log M)\).

This solution efficiently finds the longest increasing subsequence with the given constraints.
