title:  Search in Rotated Sorted Array II-out
permalink: /s81
---

## Problem Description

You are given an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with possible duplicates), and an integer `target`. Suppose the array is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand (i.e., `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`). This means that the array has been split into two sorted subarrays and then recombined.

You should write a function to determine if `target` is in `nums`. If `target` exists in `nums`, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What should be the return type?
   **A:** The function should return a boolean indicating whether the target is present in the array.

2. **Q:** Can the array have duplicate elements?
   **A:** Yes, the array can have duplicate elements.

3. **Q:** Is there a constraint on the length of the input array?
   **A:** The length of the array can vary but typically falls within reasonable bounds for typical algorithm problems (e.g., length `n` where `0 <= n <= 5000`).

## Strategy

To solve the problem, we can adapt binary search, which commonly has a time complexity of `O(log n)` in a regular sorted array. However, due to the presence of duplicates, the worst-case time complexity can degrade to `O(n)`. Hereâ€™s the strategy in detail:

1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to the start and end of the array.
2. Perform binary search by calculating the midpoint `mid`.
3. Check if `nums[mid]` is equal to `target`. If true, return `True`.
4. To handle the rotation, determine which part of the array is sorted:
   - If `nums[left] < nums[mid]`, then the left part is sorted.
   - If `nums[left] > nums[mid]`, then the right part must be sorted.
   - If `nums[left] == nums[mid]`, increment the left pointer to skip duplicates.
5. Depending on whether the left or right part is sorted and where the `target` lies relative to `nums[mid]`, adjust `left` and `right` pointers accordingly.

## Time Complexity

The worst-case time complexity is `O(n)` due to the potential need to linearly skip duplicates.

## Implementation

Here's the Python code implementing the above strategy:

```python
def search(nums, target):
    if not nums:
        return False
    
    left, right = 0, nums.length - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return True
        
        # Handling duplicates
        while left < mid and nums[left] == nums[mid]:
            left += 1
        
        # If the left part is sorted
        if nums[left] <= nums[mid]:
            if nums[left] <= target < nums[mid]:
                right = mid - 1
            else:
                left = mid + 1
        else:
            # If the right part is sorted
            if nums[mid] < target <= nums[right]:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
    
    return False

# Example usage:
# nums = [2, 5, 6, 0, 0, 1, 2]
# target = 0
# print(search(nums, target))  # Output: True
```

This code will help determine if the `target` exists in the rotated sorted array with duplicates.
