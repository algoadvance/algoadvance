title:  Regular Expression Matching-out
permalink: /s10
---

The problem is to implement regular expression matching with support for `'.'` and `'*'`. Given an input string `s` and a pattern `p`, implement a function that returns `true` if `s` matches the pattern `p`.

- `'.'` Matches any single character.
- `'*'` Matches zero or more of the preceding element.

The matching should cover the entire input string (not partial).

### Examples

1. **Example 1:**
    - Input: `s = "aa"`, `p = "a"`
    - Output: `false`
    - Explanation: `"a"` does not match the entire string `"aa"`.

2. **Example 2:**
    - Input: `s = "aa"`, `p = "a*"`
    - Output: `true`
    - Explanation: `'*'` means zero or more of the preceding element, `a` in this case. Therefore, by repeating `a` once, it matches the entire string.

3. **Example 3:**
    - Input: `s = "ab"`, `p = ".*"`
    - Output: `true`
    - Explanation: `'.'` matches `a` and `'*'` matches `b`.

### Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 20`
- `1 <= p.length <= 30`
- `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
- `p` contains only lowercase English letters, `'.'`, and `'*'`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can `p` begin with `'*'`?
   **A:** No, according to standard regex rules. `'*'` is always preceded by a valid character.

2. **Q:** Are there any special cases like empty strings?
   **A:** Yes, both `s` and `p` can be empty. An empty pattern only matches an empty string.

## Code

Now let's solve this problem using dynamic programming. We will build a table where `dp[i][j]` indicates whether the first `i` characters of `s` match the first `j` characters of `p`.

```python
def isMatch(s: str, p: str) -> bool:
    m, n = len(s), len(p)
    
    # dp[i][j] means whether s[:i] matches p[:j]
    dp = [[False] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    
    # Base case: Empty pattern matches empty string
    dp[0][0] = True
    
    # Handle patterns like a*, a*b*, a*b*c* etc., where they can be matched with empty string
    for j in range(1, n + 1):
        if p[j - 1] == '*':
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 2]
    
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if p[j - 1] == '.' or p[j - 1] == s[i - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1]
            elif p[j - 1] == '*':
                # Match zero occurrence of the previous character
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 2]
                # Match one or more occurrence of the previous character, if it is matching
                if p[j - 2] == '.' or p[j - 2] == s[i - 1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i][j] or dp[i - 1][j]
    
    return dp[m][n]
```

## Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a 2D DP table `dp` of size `(m+1) x (n+1)` where `m` is the length of `s` and `n` is the length of `p`.
   - `dp[i][j]` will represent whether `s[:i]` matches `p[:j]`.

2. **Base Case:**
   - `dp[0][0]` is `True` because an empty pattern matches an empty string.
   - Initialize values for patterns that can match an empty string (e.g., `a*`, `a*b*`)

3. **DP Transition:**
   - If the current pattern character `p[j-1]` is `'.'` or matches `s[i-1]`, it borrows the result from `dp[i-1][j-1]`.
   - If the current pattern character is `'*'`:
     - It considers zero occurrences of the preceding character (i.e., two characters back in the pattern).
     - If the preceding character matches the current character in the string or is `'.'`, it considers one or more occurrences.

4. **Final Result:**
   - The value at `dp[m][n]` will indicate if the entire string `s` matches the pattern `p`.

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is `O(m*n)`, where `m` is the length of the string `s` and `n` is the length of the pattern `p`. Each cell in the DP table is computed in constant time.
- The space complexity is also `O(m*n)` for the DP table.
