title:  Find Unique Binary String-out
permalink: /s1980
---
You are given an array of binary strings `nums` where each binary string is of the same length. Return a binary string of the same length that does not appear in `nums`. If there are multiple answers, you may return any of them.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = ["01","10"]
Output: "11"
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = ["00","01"]
Output: "11"
```

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = ["111","011","001"]
Output: "101"
```

Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 16`
- `nums[i].length == nums.length`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can there be duplicates in the input array?**
   - No, it is assumed that all binary strings in the input array are unique.

2. **What should we return if the input contains all possible binary strings of the given length?**
   - This situation is not possible given the problem constraints, as there's always at least one missing binary string.

3. **Is the length of each binary string always equal to the length of the array?**
   - Yes, according to the problem statement.

## Strategy
Given the constraints and problem requirements, we can use the following strategy to find a unique binary string not present in `nums`:

1. Generate all possible binary strings of length `n` (where `n` is the length of each string in the array).
2. Convert the input list of strings into a set for constant-time lookups.
3. Iterate through all possible binary strings and return the first one that is not in the set of input strings.

This approach will ensure we find a unique string, and because the length is restricted to a maximum of 16, this method will be efficient enough.

## Time Complexity
- Generating all possible binary strings of length `n` takes \(O(2^n)\).
- Checking each string against a set of size `n` (up to 16) is \(O(1)\) per check.
- The overall time complexity is \(O(n \cdot 2^n)\) where \(n \leq 16\), which is feasible within the constraints.

## Code

```python
from itertools import product

def findDifferentBinaryString(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    nums_set = set(nums)
    
    # Generate all possible binary strings of length n
    for bits in product('01', repeat=n):
        candidate = ''.join(bits)
        if candidate not in nums_set:
            return candidate

# Example usage:
nums = ["01", "10"]
print(findDifferentBinaryString(nums))  # Output: "11"
```

This code generates all possible binary strings of the given length, checks if each one is in the set of input strings, and returns the first one that is not present. This guarantees finding a unique binary string as required by the prompt.
