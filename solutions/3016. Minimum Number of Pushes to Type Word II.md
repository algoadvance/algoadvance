title:  Minimum Number of Pushes to Type Word II-out
permalink: /s3016
---

You need to type out a word using a circular keyboard. The keyboard is represented by a string `keyboard` of length `n`, where `n` is the number of keys on the circular keyboard. You start at the position of key `'a'`. Each move consists of either:
- Moving to an adjacent key, which takes 1 unit of time.
- Typing the letter at the current position, which takes 1 unit of time.

Write a function `minTimeToTypeWord(keyboard: str, word: str) -> int` to compute the minimum number of units of time required to type out the `word` using the circular keyboard.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of `n` (length of the keyboard)?**
   - This will help us determine the efficiency requirements of our algorithm.

2. **Is the `keyboard` string always guaranteed to contain the letter `'a'` from where we start?**
   - This clarifies if we always have a starting point.

3. **Does the word only contain letters that are in the `keyboard`?**
   - This confirms if we will always find the characters in `word` in the `keyboard`.

### Code

```python
def minTimeToTypeWord(keyboard: str, word: str) -> int:
    position = keyboard.index('a')
    total_time = 0
    
    for char in word:
        target_position = keyboard.index(char)
        clockwise_distance = (target_position - position) % len(keyboard)
        counter_clockwise_distance = (position - target_position) % len(keyboard)
        
        total_time += min(clockwise_distance, counter_clockwise_distance) + 1
        position = target_position
    
    return total_time

# Example usage
keyboard = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
word = "cba"
print(minTimeToTypeWord(keyboard, word))  # Output should be 5
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Start at the position of `'a'` in the `keyboard`.

2. **Iterate through the `word`**:
   - For each character in the `word`, determine its position in the `keyboard`.

3. **Calculate Distances**:
   - Compute both the clockwise and counter-clockwise distances between the current position and the target position.
   - Add the smaller distance to the total time (this represents the time to move to the target key).
   - Add one more unit of time for typing the character.

4. **Update Position**:
   - Update the current position to the position of the typed character.

5. **Return the Total Time**:
   - After processing all characters in the `word`, return the total calculated time.

### Time Complexity

- The complexity primarily involves finding the index of each character in the `keyboard`. Since this is done for each character in `word`, the time complexity is `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the length of the `word` and `n` is the length of the `keyboard`.
- If `keyboard` is represented in such a way that allows constant time lookup (like a hashmap), we can reduce this to `O(m)`, where `m` is the length of the `word`.

Given typical constraints for interview problems, this solution is likely efficient enough. However, understanding the constraints allows for potential optimizations as necessary.
