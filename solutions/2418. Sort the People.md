Given two lists `names` and `heights` of the same length `n`, where `names[i]` is the name of the ith person and `heights[i]` is the height of the ith person, return the names sorted in descending order by the people's heights.

**Example 1:**
```python
Input: names = ["Mary","John","Emma"], heights = [180,165,170]
Output: ["Mary","Emma","John"]
```

**Example 2:**
```python
Input: names = ["Alice","Bob","Bob"], heights = [155,185,150]
Output: ["Bob","Alice","Bob"]
```

**Constraints:**
- `n == names.length == heights.length`
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= heights[i] <= 10^5`
- `names[i]` consists of alphabets.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Will there be duplicate heights?
   - Yes, heights can be the same for multiple people.
   
2. Is the order of names in the resulting list important when two people have the same height?
   - In the example provided, it does not specify how to handle tie cases. We can assume the stable sort property, meaning if two people have the same height, their relative order in the result should be the same as in the input list.

## Strategy
1. Zip the `names` and `heights` lists together to create pairs of (name, height).
2. Sort these pairs based on height in descending order.
3. Extract and return the names from the sorted pairs.

## Code
Hereâ€™s a Python implementation for the problem:

```python
def sortPeople(names, heights):
    # Zip the names and heights together
    people = list(zip(names, heights))
    
    # Sort the zipped list by height in descending order
    people.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)
    
    # Extract the sorted names
    sorted_names = [person[0] for person in people]
    
    return sorted_names
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n), where n is the number of people. This comes from the sorting step.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), due to the space required to store the list of tuples and the final sorted list of names.

This solution is efficient given the problem constraints. The space complexity is linear relative to the input size, and the time complexity is optimal for sorting.
