Reverse a singly linked list.

### Example:
```
Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL
Output: 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the structure of the linked list node?**
   Each node will have two fields: `val` (the value) and `next` (the pointer to the next node).
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the values of the linked list's nodes?**
   No specific constraints other than typical integer values.

3. **Do we need to handle any specific edge cases?**
   - An empty linked list (i.e., `head` is `None`).
   - A linked list with only one node.

## Strategy
1. Weâ€™ll use an iterative approach to reverse the linked list, although a recursive approach is also possible.
2. The plan:
   - Initialize two pointers, `prev` as `None` and `curr` as the head of the list.
   - Traverse the list. For each node:
     - Store the next node temporarily.
     - Reverse the current node's `next` pointer to point to `prev`.
     - Move `prev` and `curr` one step forward.
3. The `prev` pointer will eventually point to the new head of the reversed list.

## Code

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def reverseList(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    prev = None
    curr = head
    
    while curr:
        next_temp = curr.next  # Store the next node
        curr.next = prev       # Reverse the link
        prev = curr            # Move prev to current node
        curr = next_temp       # Move curr to next node
    
    return prev

# Helper function to print the list (for understanding/debugging purposes)
def printList(head: ListNode):
    while head:
        print(head.val, end=" -> ")
        head = head.next
    print("NULL")
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We visit each node once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) because we are reusing the existing node structures and only using a few pointers.

This approach ensures that the linked list is reversed efficiently with minimal memory overhead.
