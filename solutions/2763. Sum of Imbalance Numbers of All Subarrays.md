title:  Sum of Imbalance Numbers of All Subarrays-out
permalink: /s2763
---

You are given an integer array `nums`. The imbalance number of a subarray is defined as the number of elements that are not followed by a smaller element in that subarray. You need to return the sum of imbalance numbers of all subarrays of `nums`.

**Example:**
```python
Input: nums = [2, 3, 1, 4]
Output: 20
Explanation: 
The subarrays of nums are: [2], [3], [1], [4], [2, 3], [3, 1], [1, 4], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 4], [2, 3, 1, 4]. 
Let's calculate their imbalance numbers:
[2] => 1
[3] => 1
[1] => 1
[4] => 1
[2, 3] => 2
[3, 1] => 2
[1, 4] => 2
[2, 3, 1] => 3
[3, 1, 4] => 3
[2, 3, 1, 4] => 4
Sum of all imbalance numbers = 20
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Do we need to consider all possible non-empty subarrays?
   - Yes.
2. Should the implementation be optimized in terms of time complexity? 
   - Yes, the most efficient solution is preferred.
3. Is there any constraint on the size of the `nums` array?
   - The constraints are not explicitly stated but generally constraints for such problems can go up to `10^4`.

## Strategy

1. **Observation**: Understand the definition of the imbalance number and how to compute it for a subarray.
2. **Brute Force Approach**:
   - Generate all possible subarrays.
   - For each subarray, calculate its imbalance number.
   - Sum up all imbalance numbers.

3. **Optimized Approach**:
   - Directly computing for each subarray will be inefficient (`O(n^3)` time complexity). Instead, let's try to count and aggregate results dynamically.
   - Use auxiliary data structures to keep track of previous computations.

## Code

Letâ€™s implement the brute force approach first and then discuss optimization.

```python
def sumOfImbalanceNumbers(nums):
    def imbalance_number(arr):
        imbalance = 1
        for i in range(1, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] <= arr[i-1]:
                imbalance += 1
        return imbalance

    n = len(nums)
    total_imbalance = 0
    
    # Check each subarray
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            subarray = nums[i:j+1]
            total_imbalance += imbalance_number(subarray)
    
    return total_imbalance

# Example usage:
nums = [2, 3, 1, 4]
print(sumOfImbalanceNumbers(nums))  # Output: 20
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Brute Force Approach**:
   - Generating all subarrays: `O(n^2)`
   - Calculating imbalance for each subarray: `O(n)`
   - Hence, overall Time Complexity: `O(n^3)`

Note that this brute force approach is not efficient for larger `n`. Hence, we would need to look for a more optimized approach by potentially leveraging segment trees, balanced binary search trees, or other data structures to keep track of elements dynamically to bring down the time complexity. 

In interviews, it's always good to first present a working brute force solution before discussing potential optimizations.
