You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. Determine the first character that repeats in the string and return it. If no character repeats, return an empty string.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can we assume the input string only contains lowercase English letters?
   **A**: Yes.
   
2. **Q**: Is it possible for the input string to be empty?
   **A**: Yes, and if the string is empty, the function should return an empty string.
   
3. **Q**: Should we consider non-consecutive repeats?
   **A**: Yes, any character that appears more than once in the string.
   
4. **Q**: What should be returned if there are no repeated characters in the string?
   **A**: An empty string.

## Strategy

1. Iterate through the string while keeping track of characters that we have already seen.
2. Use a set to store characters as they appear.
3. For each character:
   - If the character has already been seen, return that character as it is the first one to appear twice.
   - If the character has not been seen, add it to the set for tracking.
4. If no character repeats, return an empty string.

## Code

```python
def first_letter_to_appear_twice(s: str) -> str:
    seen = set()
    
    for char in s:
        if char in seen:
            return char
        seen.add(char)
    
    return ""
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string. Each character is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(min(n, 26)), because we are storing each unique character in a set, and there are at most 26 unique lowercase English letters.
