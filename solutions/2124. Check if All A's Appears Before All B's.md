title:  Check if All A's Appears Before All B's-out

Given a string `s` consisting of only the characters 'a' and 'b', return `True` if every 'a' in `s` appears before every 'b'. Otherwise, return `False`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: 
   - Is the input string guaranteed to contain only 'a' and 'b' characters?
   - What is the maximum length of the input string `s`?

2. **Output**:
   - Should we handle edge cases like an empty string or a string with only one type of character?

Assuming:
- The input string `s` contains only 'a' and 'b'.
- The string length is within a reasonable limit (e.g., 1 ≤ `s.length` ≤ 10⁵).

### Strategy

To check if all 'a's appear before all 'b's, we can use a simple scan of the string:
1. Traverse the string from left to right.
2. Once a 'b' is encountered, ensure that no 'a' appears after it.
3. If an 'a' is found after 'b', return `False`.
4. Complete the traversal and return `True` if the condition is satisfied.

### Code

```python
def checkString(s: str) -> bool:
    # Flag to indicate if a 'b' has been seen
    b_seen = False
    
    for char in s:
        if char == 'b':
            b_seen = True
        elif char == 'a' and b_seen:
            # If 'a' is found after 'b'
            return False
    
    return True
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. The string is traversed exactly once, making this approach efficient even for larger strings.

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**: Initialize a flag `b_seen` to `False`.
2. **Traversal**: Iterate through each character in the string.
   - If the character is 'b', set `b_seen` to `True`.
   - If the character is 'a' and `b_seen` is `True`, return `False` immediately because an 'a' has appeared after a 'b'.
3. **Result**: If the loop completes without encountering any 'a' after a 'b', return `True`.

This solution ensures that the condition of all 'a's appearing before 'b's is checked efficiently.
