title:  Find the Maximum Length of Valid Subsequence II-out
permalink: /s3202
---

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. A subsequence of a string is considered valid if it is a subsequence of "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" (the alphabet in order). Find the length of the longest valid subsequence of `s`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the maximum length of the input string `s`?
   
     The length of the input string `s` can go up to 10^5.
     
2. **Output**:
   - Should the function return just the length of the longest valid subsequence?
   
     Yes, you should return the length of the longest valid subsequence.

3. **Examples**:
   - Example 1: For `s = "abcde"`, the subsequence "abcde" is valid, and its length is 5.
   - Example 2: For `s = "zxyab"`, a valid subsequence could be "ab" and its length is 2.
   - Example 3: For `s = "acbde"`, the subsequence "abcde" isn't possible but "abe" is, and its length is 3.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to find the longest subsequence of the string `s` that fits the order of the alphabet "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz". The strategy is straightforward:

1. **Initialize** a pointer or index to track the position in the alphabet string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".
2. **Iterate through** the input string `s`, and for each character in `s`, check if it matches the current character in the alphabet string at our position.
3. If it matches, move the position forward in the alphabet string.
4. Continue this until you have processed all characters in `s`.

This approach is efficient as it requires passing through the string `s` only once.

### Code

```python
def longestValidSubsequence(s: str) -> int:
    # Alphabet string to compare against
    alphabet = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
    
    alphabet_index = 0
    count = 0

    for char in s:
        if alphabet_index < len(alphabet) and char == alphabet[alphabet_index]:
            count += 1
            alphabet_index += 1

    return count

# Example usage
print(longestValidSubsequence("abcde"))  # Output: 5
print(longestValidSubsequence("zxyab"))  # Output: 2
print(longestValidSubsequence("acbde"))  # Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is **O(n)**, where **n** is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we are iterating through the string `s` exactly once. The space complexity is **O(1)**, as we are using a fixed amount of extra space that does not scale with the input size.
