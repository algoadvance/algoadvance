Leetcode Problem 1927: Sum Game

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

You are given a string `num` of even length consisting of digits and '?' characters. On each player's turn, they can replace one of the '?' characters in the string with any digit from '0' to '9'. The game ends when there are no more '?' characters left.

Alice wins if the sum of the digits in the first half of the string is not equal to the sum of the digits in the second half. Bob wins if the sums are equal.

Assume both players play optimally.

Return `true` if Alice wins, and `false` if Bob wins.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can there be any invalid characters in the input string?** 
   - No, the input string `num` only consists of digits and '?' characters.

2. **Is the input length always even?**
   - Yes, as stated, the length of `num` is guaranteed to be even.

3. **Who plays the optimal game here?**
   - Both Alice and Bob play optimally.

### Strategy
1. **Calculate Sums and Counts for Both Halves:**
   - Split the string into two halves.
   - Compute the sum of digits and count the number of '?' characters in both halves.

2. **Determine the Difference:**
   - Calculate the difference in the sums of the digits for the two halves.
   - Calculate the difference in the number of '?' characters between the two halves.

3. **Analyze Possible Outcomes:**
   - If the sum differences can be balanced by some optimal placement of digits in place of '?' by Alice and Bob, Bob wins.
   - Otherwise, Alice wins.

4. **Mathematical Conditions:**
   - Derive a mathematical condition to check whether there's any scenario where Bob can force the sums to be equal.

### Code

Here's a python implementation based on the above strategy:

```python
def sumGame(num: str) -> bool:
    n = len(num)
    half = n // 2

    sum1, sum2 = 0, 0
    count1, count2 = 0, 0

    # Calculate sums and counts of '?' in both halves
    for i in range(half):
        if num[i] == '?':
            count1 += 1
        else:
            sum1 += int(num[i])
    
    for i in range(half, n):
        if num[i] == '?':
            count2 += 1
        else:
            sum2 += int(num[i])

    # Difference in the sums and counts
    diff_sum = sum1 - sum2
    diff_count = count1 - count2

    # Even number of '?'
    if diff_count % 2 == 1:
        return True

    # Balancing sums
    if 9 * (diff_count // 2) != diff_sum:
        return True

    return False

# Example Usage
print(sumGame("25??") )    # Should return True
print(sumGame("?3295???") )# Should return False
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string, because the solution requires a single pass through the string to compute the sums and counts of '?'. This is efficient given the constraints.
