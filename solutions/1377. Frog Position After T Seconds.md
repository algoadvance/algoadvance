title:  Frog Position After T Seconds-out
permalink: /s1377
---

Given an undirected tree consisting of `n` vertices numbered from `1` to `n` and exactly `n-1` edges, a frog starts at vertex `1` at time `t = 0`. At each second, the frog jumps to an adjacent vertex. However, the frog will not jump if it comes back to a vertex it just visited or if it does not have any unvisited vertices to jump to. In any such situation, the frog will stay at that particular vertex. 

Given the edges of the tree, the integer `n`, and an integer `t`, return the probability that the frog is at vertex `target` after `t` seconds.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Clarify Tree Structure**: 
    - The tree is an undirected graph with no cycles and is fully connected.
    
2. **Constraints**:
    - `1 <= n <= 100`
    - `1 <= edges.length == n - 1`
    - `edges[i].length == 2`
    - `1 <= ui, vi <= n`
    - `1 <= t <= 100`
    - `1 <= target <= n`
    
3. **Probabilistic Movement**:
    - At each second, the frog can move to any of its adjacent vertices with equal probability.
    - If there are no available moves that lead to an unvisited vertex or if the frog is to stay at a vertex (that has no new vertex to move to), the frog remains in place.

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation**:
    - Represent the tree using an adjacency list.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
    - Use BFS to simulate the movement of the frog.
    - Track the probability of the frog being at each vertex each second.

3. **Probability Calculation**:
    - For each second, update the probability distribution among the vertices based on possible moves to unvisited vertices.

4. **Stopping Condition**:
    - The frog can't move if it has no unvisited adjacent vertices or if it exactly reaches the specified time `t`.

### Code

Here is the Python implementation for the problem using BFS:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def frogPosition(n, edges, t, target):
    if n == 1:
        return 1.0 if target == 1 else 0.0
    
    # Build the graph (tree)
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)
    
    # BFS with probability tracking
    queue = deque([(1, 1.0)])  # (current_vertex, current_probability)
    visited = [False] * (n + 1)
    visited[1] = True
    current_t = 0
    
    while queue and current_t <= t:
        level_size = len(queue)
        for _ in range(level_size):
            current, prob = queue.popleft()
            unvisited_neighbors = [neighbor for neighbor in graph[current] if not visited[neighbor]]
            if current == target:
                if current_t == t or not unvisited_neighbors:
                    return prob
                else:
                    return 0.0
            for neighbor in unvisited_neighbors:
                visited[neighbor] = True
                queue.append((neighbor, prob / len(unvisited_neighbors)))
        current_t += 1
    
    return 0.0

# Example Usage
n = 7
edges = [[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 7], [2, 4], [2, 6], [3, 5]]
t = 2
target = 4
print(frogPosition(n, edges, t, target))  # Output: Some probability
```

### Time Complexity

- **Build the Graph**: \(O(n)\) - constructing the adjacency list.
- **BFS Traversal**: \(O(n)\) - each vertex and edge is processed once.
- **Overall**: \(O(n)\), which is efficient given the constraints \(n \leq 100\).

This approach ensures that we accurately simulate the frog's movement while tracking probabilities, leading to a correct and efficient solution.
