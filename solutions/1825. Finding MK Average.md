title:  Finding MK Average-out
permalink: /s1825
---

Given an integer stream, implement a class `MKAverage` that calculates the MKAverage for the stream.

1. The class `MKAverage` has the following methods:
   - `MKAverage(int m, int k)`: Initializes the object with parameters `m` and `k`.
   - `addElement(int num)`: Inserts a new element `num` into the stream.
   - `calculateMKAverage()`: Returns the MKAverage for the last `m` elements of the stream. The MKAverage is calculated by removing the smallest `k` elements and the largest `k` elements from the last `m` elements and then finding the average of the remaining elements. The result is truncated to the nearest integer.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What should happen if there are less than `m` elements? Should we still calculate the MKAverage or raise an error?
   - **Assumption**: If there are less than `m` elements, `calculateMKAverage()` should return `-1`.

2. Are there constraints on the values of `m` and `k`?
   - `m` is guaranteed to be greater than `2*k`.
   - This ensures that there are at least `m - 2*k` elements left after removing the smallest `k` and the largest `k`.

### Strategy

1. Maintain a fixed-size sliding window of the last `m` elements.
2. Use three sorted data structures:
   - One for the smallest `k` elements.
   - One for the largest `k` elements.
   - One for the middle `m - 2*k` elements.
3. Insertions and deletions should ensure these structures remain updated.
4. Calculate the sum of the middle elements to quickly fetch the MKAverage.

### Code

```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedList

class MKAverage:

    def __init__(self, m: int, k: int):
        self.m = m
        self.k = k
        self.elements = []
        self.low = SortedList()
        self.mid = SortedList()
        self.high = SortedList()
        self.mid_sum = 0 # Sum of elements in mid section
    
    def addElement(self, num: int) -> None:
        if len(self.elements) == self.m:
            oldest = self.elements.pop(0)
            if oldest in self.low:
                self.low.remove(oldest)
            elif oldest in self.high:
                self.high.remove(oldest)
            else:
                self.mid.remove(oldest)
                self.mid_sum -= oldest
                
        self.elements.append(num)
        self._add_to_structure(num)

        if len(self.elements) == self.m:
            while len(self.low) > self.k:
                move_up = self.low.pop()
                self.mid.add(move_up)
                self.mid_sum += move_up
            while len(self.high) > self.k:
                move_down = self.high.pop(0)
                self.mid.add(move_down)
                self.mid_sum += move_down

    def _add_to_structure(self, num: int) -> None:
        if len(self.low) < self.k or num <= self.low[-1]:
            self.low.add(num)
        elif len(self.high) < self.k or num >= self.high[0]:
            self.high.add(num)
        else:
            self.mid.add(num)
            self.mid_sum += num
        
        if len(self.low) > self.k:
            move_to_mid = self.low.pop()
            self.mid.add(move_to_mid)
            self.mid_sum += move_to_mid
        
        if len(self.high) > self.k:
            move_to_mid = self.high.pop(0)
            self.mid.add(move_to_mid)
            self.mid_sum += move_to_mid

    def calculateMKAverage(self) -> int:
        if len(self.elements) < self.m:
            return -1
        return self.mid_sum // (self.m - 2 * self.k)
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: O(1)
- **addElement**: O(log m) for insertion into sorted containers
- **calculateMKAverage**: O(1) for direct calculation since sum is maintained

The primary work involves maintaining the sorting of elements which is handled efficiently by the `SortedList` from `sortedcontainers` library. This ensures that both add and remove operations stay within logarithmic time complexity.
