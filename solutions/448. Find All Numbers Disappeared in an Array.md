title:  Find All Numbers Disappeared in an Array-out
permalink: /s448

1. **Input Consistency**: Is the input array always in the range `1` to `n` (inclusive), where `n` is the length of the array?
2. **Duplicates**: Can the input array contain duplicate numbers?
3. **Output Requirements**: Should the output be returned as a list of integers?

### Strategy:
The problem requires finding all numbers in the range `[1, n]` that are missing from the given array. Given that the array might contain duplicates but the values are bound within `1` to `n`, we can use the properties of the array to mark which numbers are present.

Here's a step-by-step strategy to achieve the solution efficiently:
1. **Iterate through the array**: Use the numbers in the array to mark corresponding indices (by making them negative) as visited.
2. **Identify Missing Numbers**: After marking, the indices which contain positive numbers indicate that their corresponding indices+1 values are missing in the array.
3. **Result Compilation**: Compile these missing values into the result list.

### Code:
```python
def findDisappearedNumbers(nums):
    # Mark numbers present in the array by marking the index corresponding to those numbers as negative
    for num in nums:
        index = abs(num) - 1
        if nums[index] > 0:
            nums[index] = -nums[index]

    # Collect the indices + 1 where the values are still positive
    result = []
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[i] > 0:
            result.append(i + 1)
    return result
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: This is derived from the need to iterate through the array twice â€” first to mark the numbers and then to collect the missing numbers.
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)**, if we do not consider the output list. The algorithm modifies the input array in-place and uses only a constant amount of extra space.

This strategy effectively finds the missing numbers by leveraging the properties of the input array, ensuring an efficient and concise solution.
