title:  Find Original Array From Doubled Array-out
permalink: /s2007
---

Given an array of integers `changed`, which has been obtained by multiplying an original array `original` by 2, find the `original` array. Specifically, `changed` is a doubled array such that it can be formed by doubling each element of some original array and shuffling the resulting array.

Return the original array, or an empty array if `changed` is not a valid doubled array.

### Example:
```
Input: changed = [1,3,4,2,6,8]
Output: [1,3,4]

Input: changed = [6,3,0,1]
Output: []

Input: changed = [1]
Output: []
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can the array `changed` contain negative numbers?
    - No, typically problem constraints state that the numbers should be non-negative (though this should be confirmed).
2. Can the numbers in `changed` include zero?
    - Yes, zero can be included.
3. What should be the result if `changed` is already sorted?
    - Sorting the array will often be part of the strategy to make the solution easier.
4. Are we guaranteed that the length of `changed` is even?
    - Not always, thus if it is odd we can directly return an empty array.

### Strategy:
1. **Sort the `changed` array**: Sorting helps processing smaller numbers first which aids in pairing them with double values.
2. **Use a dictionary to count occurrences**: This helps in efficiently checking and reducing counts of paired elements.
3. **Check each element**: For each element in the sorted array:
   - If its count is zero, continue to the next element.
   - Check if the double of this element exists and has a positive count.
   - Append the element to the result list and adjust counts for the current element and its double.
4. **Validate the final result**: If successfully processed, the count dictionary should be clean, otherwise return an empty array if there are inconsistencies.

### Code Implementation:

```python
from collections import Counter

def findOriginalArray(changed):
    if len(changed) % 2 != 0:
        return []
    
    changed.sort()
    original = []
    count = Counter(changed)
    
    for num in changed:
        if count[num] == 0:
            continue
        if count[num * 2] == 0:
            return []
        
        original.append(num)
        count[num] -= 1
        count[num * 2] -= 1
    
    return original

# Test cases
print(findOriginalArray([1,3,4,2,6,8]))  # Output: [1,3,4]
print(findOriginalArray([6,3,0,1]))     # Output: []
print(findOriginalArray([1]))           # Output: []
```

### Time Complexity:
- Sorting the `changed` array takes O(n log n).
- Counting occurrences and verifying pairs are O(n).

Overall, the time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting step.

### Edge Cases:
- Arrays with zero elements should be handled correctly.
- Arrays where any element does not have its double should directly result in an empty `original`.

With these steps and considerations, the problem can be efficiently and clearly solved.
