title:  Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II-out
permalink: /s82
---

You're given the head of a sorted linked list. Delete all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.

#### Example:
Given the following linked list: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 3 -> 4 -> 4 -> 5`, return `1 -> 2 -> 5`.

Given the following linked list: `1 -> 1 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3`, return `2 -> 3`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the linked list be empty?**
   - Yes, it can be. If the list is empty, the output should also be an empty list.
   
2. **Will the linked list always be sorted?**
   - Yes, according to the problem statement, the linked list will always be sorted.

3. **What should be returned if the linked list contains all duplicates?**
   - An empty list should be returned if there are no distinct elements.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize a dummy node**: Create a dummy node to simplify edge cases and use it to build the resulting list.

2. **Iterate through the list**: Use a pointer (`current`) to traverse the linked list.

3. **Skip duplicates**: While traversing, check if the current node has the same value as the next node. If so, skip all nodes with this value.

4. **Add non-duplicates to the result list**: If the next value is not a duplicate, attach it to the result list.

5. **Move to the next unique value**: Continue this process until the end of the linked list.

### Code

Here is the Python code to solve this problem:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def deleteDuplicates(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    # Create a dummy node to handle edge cases
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    dummy.next = head
    current = dummy

    while current.next and current.next.next:
        if current.next.val == current.next.next.val:
            # Detected duplicates, get the duplicate value
            dup_val = current.next.val
            # Skip all nodes with this duplicate value
            while current.next and current.next.val == dup_val:
                current.next = current.next.next
        else:
            # No duplicate detected, move to the next node
            current = current.next

    return dummy.next
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the linked list. Every node is processed at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), since we are using a constant amount of extra space (not counting the output list).

This approach efficiently removes all duplicates from the sorted linked list and maintains the required sorted order.
