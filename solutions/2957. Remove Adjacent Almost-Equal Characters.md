title:  Remove Adjacent Almost-Equal Characters-out
permalink: /s2957
---

You are tasked with the following problem:

Given a string `s`, remove characters from the string where two adjacent characters are "almost-equal." Two characters are considered almost-equal if their ASCII values differ by at most 1. Continuously remove adjacent almost-equal characters until no more removals can be done.

For instance:

1. Given the input string `s = "abccba"`, after processing, the result should be an empty string `""` because:
    - "abccba" → "abxba" (remove 'c' and 'c')
    - "abxba" → "axba" (remove 'b' and 'x')
    - "axba" → "aaba" (remove 'x' and 'b')
    - "aaba" → "bb" (remove 'a' and 'a')
    - "bb" → "" (remove 'b' and 'b')

2. Given the input string `s = "abcd"`, the result should be `abcd` because no adjacent characters have ASCII values differing by at most 1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length constraint on the string `s`?**
   - Assume `s` has a maximum length constraint of 10^4.

2. **What if the string is empty?**
   - If the string is empty, the output should also be an empty string.

3. **Are there any special characters in the string, or just lowercase and uppercase English letters?**
   - Assume the string contains only lowercase and uppercase English letters.

### Strategy

1. **Stack Approach**: Use a stack-based approach to process the string. Traverse through each character in the string and use a stack to keep track of characters that are not yet removed.
2. **Removal Condition**: Compare the current character with the character at the top of the stack. If their ASCII values differ by at most 1, pop the stack (remove the top character) and skip adding the current character to the stack. Otherwise, push the current character onto the stack.
3. **Final Result**: The stack will contain the characters that cannot be removed. Convert the stack back to a string for the final result.

This approach ensures we process each character efficiently and allows instant removals.

### Code

```python
def remove_almost_equal_characters(s: str) -> str:
    stack = []
    
    for char in s:
        if stack and abs(ord(stack[-1]) - ord(char)) <= 1:
            stack.pop()
        else:
            stack.append(char)
    
    return ''.join(stack)

# Test cases
print(remove_almost_equal_characters("abccba"))  # Output: ""
print(remove_almost_equal_characters("abcd"))    # Output: "abcd"
print(remove_almost_equal_characters("abacd"))   # Output: "d"
print(remove_almost_equal_characters(""))        # Output: ""
print(remove_almost_equal_characters("aabbcc"))  # Output: ""
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string. This is because each character is pushed to and popped from the stack at most once.

### Summary

This solution effectively removes adjacent almost-equal characters from the string using a stack-based approach. It ensures optimal performance and handles edge cases such as empty strings and strings with no adjacent almost-equal characters.
