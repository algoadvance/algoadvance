title:  Split Array into Consecutive Subsequences-out
permalink: /s659
---

You are given an integer array `nums` that is sorted in non-decreasing order. Determine if it is possible to split `nums` into one or more subsequences such that both of the following conditions are true:

1. Each subsequence is a consecutive increasing sequence (i.e., each integer is exactly one more than the previous integer).
2. Each subsequence has a length of 3 or more.

Return `true` if you can split the array according to the above conditions, or `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the size of `nums`?**
   - The problem does not specify constraints, but typical array constraints and common values should be assumed (e.g., size up to 10^5).

2. **What if there are repeating numbers in the array?**
   - Since the array is sorted and you are tasked with finding consecutive subsequences, repeating numbers should not disrupt the ability to find or form consecutive subsequences.

3. **Are negative numbers included in the array?**
   - The problem statement does not specify, but we should be prepared for both positive and negative integers given the general nature of integers.

### Strategy

1. Use a hashmap (`frequency`) to keep track of the frequency of each element in `nums`.
2. Use another hashmap (`appendfreq`) to track how many consecutive subsequences can be extended with the current element.
3. Iterate through each number in `nums`.
   - Check if the current number can be added to a previously closed subsequence.
   - If not, form a new subsequence if the next two consecutive numbers are available.
4. Return `False` if unable to meet the above conditions, otherwise return `True`.

### Code

```python
def isPossible(nums):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Frequency hashmap to count the occurrences of each number
    frequency = defaultdict(int)
    # Appendfreq hashmap to track the possibility of appending the current number to an existing subsequence
    appendfreq = defaultdict(int)
    
    for num in nums:
        frequency[num] += 1
    
    for num in nums:
        if frequency[num] == 0:
            continue
        
        # If we can append num to an existing subsequence ending in num-1
        if appendfreq[num - 1] > 0:
            appendfreq[num - 1] -= 1
            appendfreq[num] += 1
        # If not, try to create a new subsequence num, num+1, num+2
        elif frequency[num + 1] > 0 and frequency[num + 2] > 0:
            frequency[num + 1] -= 1
            frequency[num + 2] -= 1
            appendfreq[num + 2] += 1
        else:
            return False
        
        frequency[num] -= 1
    
    return True
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Time Complexity: O(N)**
   - Where N is the length of `nums`. We make a single pass through `nums` to build the `frequency` hashmap and another pass to try and build/append the subsequences.
2. **Space Complexity: O(N)**
   - The space complexity is also O(N) due to the usage of the `frequency` and `appendfreq` hashmaps.

This approach ensures an efficient check for forming necessary subsequences while adhering to the problem constraints.
