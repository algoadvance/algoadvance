**Leetcode Problem 1012: Numbers With Repeated Digits**

Given a positive integer n, return the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that have at least one repeated digit.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of n?**
   - n can be between 1 and 10^9 as per typical constraints on such problems on Leetcode.

2. **Do we need to consider leading zeros?**
   - No, leading zeros are not a concern since n is a positive integer.

3. **Are there any specific edge cases to consider?**
   - Yes, edge cases would include:
     - The smallest constraint, such as n = 1.
     - Larger constraints, such as n = 10^9.

### Strategy

1. **Calculate the Total Count:**
   - First, identify all numbers from 1 to n.
   
2. **Subtract Non-Repetitive Numbers:**
   - Let's focus on finding numbers without any repeated digits.
   - Use combinatorial counting to determine the count of numbers up to n having all unique digits.

3. **Complement Calculation:**
   - Subtract the count of non-repetitive digit numbers from the total count of numbers up to n to get the count of numbers with at least one repeated digit.

### Step-by-Step Implementation

1. **Convert n to a string to analyze digit-wise.**
2. **Use backtracking to generate non-repetitive digit numbers and count them.**
3. **Count numbers with unique digits using combinatorial counting.**

### Code

```python
def numDupDigitsAtMostN(n: int) -> int:
    def countUniqueDigits(limit: int) -> int:
        digits = list(map(int, str(limit + 1)))
        length = len(digits)
        
        # Step 1: Count numbers with digits < `length`
        count = 0
        for i in range(1, length):
            count += 9 * permutations(9, i - 1)
        
        # Step 2: Count numbers with digits = `length` starting with a non-zero digit
        seen = set()
        for i in range(length):
            for x in range(1 if i == 0 else 0, digits[i]):
                if x in seen:
                    continue
                count += permutations(9 - i, length - i - 1)
            if digits[i] in seen:
                break
            seen.add(digits[i])
        
        return count
    
    def permutations(m: int, k: int) -> int:
        if k == 0:
            return 1
        else:
            return m * permutations(m - 1, k - 1)
    
    total_numbers = n
    unique_numbers = countUniqueDigits(n)
    
    return total_numbers - unique_numbers

# Let's test with an example
print(numDupDigitsAtMostN(20))  # Expected output: 1 (only 11 is repeated)
print(numDupDigitsAtMostN(100))  # Expected output: 10 (11, 22, ..., 99)
print(numDupDigitsAtMostN(1000))  # Expected output can be calculated manually.
```

### Time Complexity

The method primarily makes use of combinatorial counting and a small amount of backtracking:

- **Time Complexity:** O(log(n) x P(10)), where P(10) is the permutations function which itself runs in constant time for small values like `9!`.

This is efficient with respect to the constraints and ensures both clarity and performance.
