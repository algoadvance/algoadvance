title:  Find the Number of Distinct Colors Among the Balls-out
permalink: /s3160
---

### Problem Statement
You are given an array of integers representing different colored balls. Your task is to find out how many distinct colors are there among the balls.

### Clarifying Questions
Before we proceed, here are a few clarifying questions:
1. What are the constraints on the values in the array? (e.g., are they all positive integers, can they be negative, will they be within a certain range?)
2. Can the array be empty?
3. Is there any need to consider edge cases such as very large arrays?

### Strategy
The strategy to solve this problem involves using a Python set. A set inherently does not allow duplicates, making it an ideal structure to identify unique elements. Here are the steps we'll take:

1. Convert the array into a set.
2. The number of distinct elements in the array is simply the size of the set.

### Time Complexity
- Constructing a set from an array has a time complexity of \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of elements in the array.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity of our approach is \( O(n) \).

### Code
Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def countDistinctColors(colors):
    # Convert the list to a set to remove any duplicates
    distinct_colors = set(colors)
    # The length of the set is the number of distinct colors
    return len(distinct_colors)

# Example usage:
colors = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 4, 5]
print(countDistinctColors(colors))  # Output: 5
```

This code defines a function `countDistinctColors` which takes a list of colors and returns the number of distinct colors. The example usage demonstrates how to call the function and print the result.
