You are given a license key represented as a string `s` that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes. The string is separated into `n + 1` groups by `n` dashes. You are also given an integer `k`.

You want to reformat the string such that each group contains exactly `k` characters, except for the first group, which could be shorter than `k` but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups, and all lowercase letters should be converted to uppercase.

Return the reformatted license key.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", k = 4
Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"
Explanation: The string s has been split into two parts, each with 4 characters.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "2-5g-3-J", k = 2
Output: "2-5G-3J"
Explanation: The string s has been split into three parts, each with 2 characters except the first part as it could be shorter than 2.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the input string `s` contain any characters other than alphanumeric characters and dashes?
   **A:** No, the string `s` will only contain alphanumeric characters and dashes.
   
2. **Q:** In the output, should the first group ever be empty?
   **A:** No, the first group must contain at least one character.

### Strategy

1. **Remove Dashes:** Remove all existing dashes from the string `s`.
2. **Convert to Uppercase:** Convert the entire string to uppercase.
3. **Divide into Groups:** Starting from the end of the string, divide the string into groups of `k` characters. The first group may be shorter, depending on the remainder.
4. **Join with Dashes:** Join the groups with dashes and return the result.

### Code

```python
def licenseKeyFormatting(s: str, k: int) -> str:
    # Remove all dashes and convert to uppercase
    s = s.replace('-', '').upper()
    
    # Initialize a list to hold the parts
    parts = []
    
    # Process the cleaned string from the end to the beginning
    while len(s) > k:
        parts.append(s[-k:])
        s = s[:-k]
    
    # Add the remaining part (which is the first group)
    parts.append(s)
    
    # Join the parts with dashes
    return '-'.join(parts[::-1])

# Example usage
print(licenseKeyFormatting("5F3Z-2e-9-w", 4))  # Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"
print(licenseKeyFormatting("2-5g-3-J", 2))     # Output: "2-5G-3J"
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is O(N), where N is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we iterate through the string multiple times to remove dashes, convert to uppercase, and form the groups.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is also O(N) since we are storing parts of the string in a list, which in the worst case scenario, stores all characters from input `s`.
