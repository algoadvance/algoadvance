title:  Count Hills and Valleys in an Array-out
permalink: /s2210
---

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. A hill is a peak element (greater than both of its neighboring elements), and a valley is a trough element (less than both of its neighboring elements). The first and last elements of `nums` cannot be hills or valleys.

You need to return the number of hills and valleys in `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array have duplicate elements?**
   Yes, the array can have duplicate elements.

2. **Should we consider elements with the same value as their neighbors as potential hills or valleys?**
   No, elements with the same value as their neighbors should not be considered as hills or valleys.

3. **What is the range of the array length?**
   The length of `nums` can range from 1 to 10^5.

4. **What is the range of array elements?**
   The integers in `nums` can range from -10^5 to 10^5.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate through the array**:
   - Traverse the array from the second element to the second last element.
   - For each element, check if it is greater than both its neighbors (hill) or less than both its neighbors (valley).

2. **Skip duplicate elements**:
   - If the current element is equal to the previous element, continue to the next iteration to avoid unnecessary duplicate checks.

3. **Count hills and valleys**:
   - Use a counter to keep track of the number of hills and valleys found.
   
4. **Return the counter**.

### Code
```python
def count_hills_and_valleys(nums):
    if len(nums) < 3:
        return 0
    
    count = 0
    
    for i in range(1, len(nums) - 1):
        if nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
            continue
        
        if nums[i] > nums[i - 1] and nums[i] > nums[i + 1]:
            count += 1
        elif nums[i] < nums[i - 1] and nums[i] < nums[i + 1]:
            count += 1
    
    return count

# Example usage:
nums = [2, 4, 1, 1, 6, 5]
print(count_hills_and_valleys(nums))  # Output: 2
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Boundary Check**:
   - If the array has fewer than 3 elements, return 0 (since hills or valleys cannot exist).

2. **Iteration and Skip Duplicates**:
   - Loop through the array from index 1 to len(nums) - 2.
   - Skip iterations where the current element is equal to the previous element.

3. **Check for Hills and Valleys**:
   - For each element, check if the current element is greater than both the previous and next elements (hill) or less than both the previous and next elements (valley).
   - Increment the count for each hill or valley found.

4. **Returning the Result**:
   - Return the count of hills and valleys.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because we iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a few extra variables regardless of the input size.
