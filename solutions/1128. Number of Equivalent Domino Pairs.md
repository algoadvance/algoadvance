title:  Number of Equivalent Domino Pairs-out
permalink: /s1128
---

Given a list of dominoes where each domino is represented as a list of two integers [a, b], return the number of pairs (i, j) for which the two dominoes are equivalent. Two dominoes (a, b) and (c, d) are considered equivalent if, and only if, either (a == c and b == d) or (a == d and b == c).

**Example:**
```
Input: dominoes = [[1,2],[2,1],[3,4],[5,6]]
Output: 1
Explanation: The only equivalent pair is (0,1), because dominoes[0] is [1,2] and dominoes[1] is [2,1].
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of values for the numbers in the dominoes?
   - How many dominoes can be in the list?
   - Is input validation required?

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Should we return the count of pairs or the pairs themselves?

3. **Edge Cases:**
    - How to handle an empty list of dominoes?
    - How to handle a list with only one domino?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. Normalize each domino such that the smaller number comes first. For example, a domino `[2, 1]` will be represented as `[1, 2]`.
2. Use a dictionary to count occurrences of each normalized domino.
3. For each unique domino, calculate the number of pairs using the combination formula `C(n, 2) = n * (n - 1) / 2` where `n` is the count of that domino.
4. Sum the results to get the final count.

### Code

Here's how we can implement this in Python:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def numEquivDominoPairs(dominoes):
    count_map = defaultdict(int)
    
    # Normalize and count each domino occurrence
    for domino in dominoes:
        normalized = tuple(sorted(domino))
        count_map[normalized] += 1
    
    pairs = 0
    # Calculate pairs
    for count in count_map.values():
        if count > 1:
            pairs += (count * (count - 1)) // 2
    
    return pairs

# Example usage
dominoes = [[1,2],[2,1],[3,4],[5,6]]
print(numEquivDominoPairs(dominoes)) # Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity

- **Normalization and Counting:** We traverse through the dominoes list once to normalize and count, resulting in O(n) time complexity where `n` is the number of dominoes.
- **Pair Calculation:** We then traverse through the dictionary of counts which has at most `n` keys (in the worst case where all dominoes are unique) resulting in O(n).

Overall, the time complexity is O(n).

### Space Complexity

- We use a dictionary to store counts of normalized dominoes, which can take up to O(n) space in the worst case where each domino is unique. Hence, the space complexity is O(n).
