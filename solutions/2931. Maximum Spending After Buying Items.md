title:  Maximum Spending After Buying Items-out
permalink: /s2931
---

You are given an integer `budget`, representing the total amount of money you have, and a 2D integer array `prices` where `prices[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that there is an item i that you can buy for either `a_i` or `b_i` amount of money. You must buy exactly one item and must spend exactly the `budget` amount of money. Return the maximum money you can spend to buy exactly one item.

If no such purchase is possible, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Should we assume all input values are positive integers?
2. Are there any constraints on the length of the prices array?
3. Can `a_i` and `b_i` be equal?

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can utilize a simple linear scan through the `prices` array to check if any of the prices match the `budget`. 

1. Initialize a variable `max_spent` to -1 to keep track of the maximum money spent which matches the `budget`.
2. Iterate through each item in the `prices` array.
    - If either `a_i` or `b_i` equals the `budget`, update `max_spent` to `budget` and break out of the loop since we cannot spend more than `budget`.
3. If no price matches the `budget`, `max_spent` remains -1, which we should return.

## Code

```python
def maximum_spending(budget: int, prices: list) -> int:
    max_spent = -1
    
    for price in prices:
        a_i, b_i = price
        if a_i == budget or b_i == budget:
            return budget
    
    return max_spent

# Example usage:
# budget = 5
# prices = [[2, 5], [3, 4], [7, 8]]
# Output: 5
print(maximum_spending(5, [[2, 5], [3, 4], [7, 8]]))  # Output: 5
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of items in the prices array, because we are iterating through the list exactly once.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(1) since no auxiliary space proportional to the input size is used.
