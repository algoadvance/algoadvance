title:  Reverse Odd Levels of Binary Tree-out
permalink: /s2415
---

You are given the `root` of a perfect binary tree. A perfect binary tree is a type of binary tree in which every internal node has exactly two children, and all the leaf nodes are at the same level.

You need to reverse the nodes at each odd level of the tree (i.e., level 1, 3, 5, ...).

* The root node is at level 0.

* You have to return the root of the modified tree.

### Example

```python
Input: root = [2,3,5,8,13,21,34]
Output: [2,5,3,8,13,21,34]
Explanation:
The tree has three levels:
   2
  / \
 3   5
/ \ / \
8  13 21 34

After reversing odd levels:
   2
  / \
 5   3
/ \ / \
8  13 21 34
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Is the input always guaranteed to be a perfect binary tree?
   - Yes.

2. Do I need to consider edge cases where the tree has very few nodes?
   - Yes, minimal cases like a tree with only one node should be considered.

## Strategy

1. We can use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse the tree level by level.
2. We create a queue that will help us keep track of nodes at each level.
3. For each level, we check if the level is odd. If it is, we reverse the values of the nodes at that level.
4. Continue the traversal until all levels have been processed.
5. Return the modified root node.

## Code

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def reverseOddLevels(root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
    if not root:
        return None
    
    from collections import deque
    
    queue = deque([root])
    level = 0
    
    while queue:
        # Number of elements at the current level
        level_length = len(queue)
        current_level = []
        
        for i in range(level_length):
            node = queue.popleft()
            
            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)
            
            current_level.append(node)
        
        if level % 2 == 1:
            n = len(current_level)
            for i in range(n // 2):
                current_level[i].val, current_level[n-1-i].val = current_level[n-1-i].val, current_level[i].val
        
        level += 1
    
    return root
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the tree. 
  - Each node is added to the queue exactly once and each level's nodes are reversed in linear time.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) 
  - For the queue that holds the nodes of the tree and for storing nodes of each level in the `current_level` list.
  
This should handle reversing the odd levels of the binary tree efficiently.
