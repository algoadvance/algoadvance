title:  Number of Students Doing Homework at a Given Time-out
permalink: /s1450
---

You are given two integer arrays `startTime` and `endTime`, and an integer `queryTime`.

The `i-th` student started doing their homework at the time `startTime[i]` and finished it at `endTime[i]`.

Return the number of students doing their homework at `queryTime`. More formally, return the number of students where `queryTime` lays in the interval `[startTime[i], endTime[i]]` inclusive.

## Example
**Example 1:**
```
Input: startTime = [1,2,3], endTime = [3,2,7], queryTime = 4
Output: 1
Explanation: One student was doing their homework at the queryTime.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: startTime = [4], endTime = [4], queryTime = 4
Output: 1
```

## Constraints:
1. `startTime.length == endTime.length`
2. `1 <= startTime.length <= 100`
3. `1 <= startTime[i] <= endTime[i] <= 1000`
4. `1 <= queryTime <= 1000`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are we guaranteed that the `startTime` and `endTime` lists are of the same length?
   - Yes, based on the constraints.
2. Is the `queryTime` guaranteed to fall within the range from 1 to 1000?
   - Yes.

## Strategy
- We need to iterate through each student's start and end times and check if `queryTime` lies between `startTime[i]` and `endTime[i]` inclusive.
- If `queryTime` is within the range `[startTime[i], endTime[i]]`, we increment our count.
- Finally, return the count.

## Code
```python
def busyStudent(startTime, endTime, queryTime):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(startTime)):
        if startTime[i] <= queryTime <= endTime[i]:
            count += 1
    return count
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the `startTime` list because we are iterating through all students once.
- Since the length of `startTime` is at most 100, this solution is efficient.

## Test Cases
1. **Test Case 1:**
   ```python
   startTime = [1,2,3]
   endTime = [3,2,7]
   queryTime = 4
   Output: 1
   ```

2. **Test Case 2:**
   ```python
   startTime = [4]
   endTime = [4]
   queryTime = 4
   Output: 1
   ```

3. **Test Case 3:**
   ```python
   startTime = [1,1,1,1,1]
   endTime = [10,10,10,10,10]
   queryTime = 5
   Output: 5
   ```
   
4. **Test Case 4:**
   ```python
   startTime = [1,2,3,4,5]
   endTime = [5,5,5,5,5]
   queryTime = 5
   Output: 5
   ```

5. **Test Case 5:**
   ```python
   startTime = [1,2,3,4,5]
   endTime = [5,6,7,8,9]
   queryTime = 1
   Output: 1
   ```

We can now confidently proceed to check the implementation through these test cases and validate its correctness.
