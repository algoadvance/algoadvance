title:  Can Convert String in K Moves-out
permalink: /s1540
---

Given two strings `s` and `t`, and an integer `k`, in one move, you can choose any character of `s` and change it to any other English lowercase character. Return `true` if you can convert `s` to `t` in exactly `k` moves. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example:**
```
Input: s = "input", t = "ouput", k = 9
Output: true
Explanation: In the 5th move, we shift the 1st character of s to get 'o'. In the 6th move, we shift the 2nd character of s to get 'u'.
```

**Constraints:**
- Both `s` and `t` are strings of the same length.
- `1 <= s.length, t.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= k <= 10^9`
- `s` and `t` consist of only lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are we allowed to make moves that don't result in a change to achieve exactly `k` moves?
2. Is the number of operations k guaranteed to be non-negative?
3. Do we have to match characters in sequence or can they be modified separately?

## Code
Here's a Python function to solve the problem:

```python
def canConvertString(s: str, t: str, k: int) -> bool:
    if len(s) != len(t):
        return False
    
    n = len(s)
    moves_needed = [0] * 26
    
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] != t[i]:
            difference = (ord(t[i]) - ord(s[i]) + 26) % 26
            moves_needed[difference] += 1
    
    for i in range(1, 26):
        max_moves_for_this_difference = (moves_needed[i] - 1) * 26 + i
        if max_moves_for_this_difference > k:
            return False
            
    return True
```

## Strategy
1. **Initialization**: Check if the lengths of `s` and `t` are different. If they are, return `False` since conversion is impossible.
2. **Calculate Differences**: Calculate the shift needed for each character in `s` to match the corresponding character in `t`.
3. **Count Moves**: Utilize an array `moves_needed` to keep track of how many changes are required for each type of shift distance.
4. **Check Feasibility**: For each possible shift distance, calculate the maximum number of distinct moves needed and compare it with `k`. If for any shift distance the required moves exceed `k`, return `False`.
5. **Return True**: If all checks pass, it means conversion within `k` moves is possible.

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string. This is because we are iterating through the characters of the strings a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, since the size of `moves_needed` is constant (fixed at 26).

Feel free to ask any clarifying questions or for further optimization!
