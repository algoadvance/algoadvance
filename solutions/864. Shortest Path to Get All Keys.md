title:  Shortest Path to Get All Keys-out
permalink: /s864
---
You are given a 2D grid of size `m x n` where:
- Each cell in the grid contains exactly one of the following characters:
  - `'.'` is an empty cell.
  - `'#'` is a wall.
  - `'@'` is the starting point.
  - Lowercase letters (`'a'` to `'f'`) represent keys.
  - Uppercase letters (`'A'` to `'F'`) represent locks.

You start at the starting point and want to reach a state where you have collected all the keys. You can move in four possible directions: up, down, left, and right. You cannot walk over a wall, and you need the corresponding key to walk over a lock.

Write a function `shortestPathAllKeys(grid: List[str]) -> int` to find the shortest path that collects all the keys. If it's impossible to collect all keys, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are there any constraints on the grid dimensions?
   - Yes, the grid dimensions will be within the range 1 ≤ m, n ≤ 30.

2. Can the grid have cells that contain neither walls, starting points, keys, nor locks?
   - No, the grid will contain one of the predefined characters in each cell.

3. Is there a guarantee that the grid will contain a valid and reachable path to collect all keys?
   - No, the grid might not always have a valid path to collect all keys.

### Strategy
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - BFS is suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.
   
2. **State Representation**:
   - Represent each state by current location `(x, y)` and a bitmask of collected keys.
   - Use a tuple `(x, y, keys)` to represent a unique state.
   
3. **Queue Initialization**:
   - Initialize the BFS queue with the starting position and an empty bitmask for keys.
   - Maintain a set to track visited states to avoid reprocessing states.

4. **BFS Expansion**:
   - For each state, check all adjacent cells.
   - If it's a key, update the bitmask.
   - If it's a lock, check if the corresponding key is in the bitmask.
   - Add new states to the queue with an increment in the step count.

5. **Termination**:
   - If a state contains all keys, return the number of steps.
   - If the queue is exhausted without finding all keys, return `-1`.

### Code
```python
from collections import deque
from typing import List, Tuple

def shortestPathAllKeys(grid: List[str]) -> int:
    # Direction vectors for moving up, down, left, and right
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    
    # Find the number of keys and starting position
    start = None
    num_keys = 0
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if grid[i][j] == '@':
                start = (i, j)
            elif grid[i][j].islower():
                num_keys += 1
    
    all_keys = (1 << num_keys) - 1
    
    # BFS initialization
    queue = deque([(start[0], start[1], 0, 0)]) # (x, y, steps, keys_bitmask)
    visited = set((start[0], start[1], 0))
    
    while queue:
        x, y, steps, keys = queue.popleft()
        
        # Check if we've collected all keys
        if keys == all_keys:
            return steps
        
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            
            if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n:
                cell = grid[nx][ny]
                
                if cell == '#':
                    continue
                
                new_keys = keys
                
                # If the cell contains a key, add it to the bitmask
                if 'a' <= cell <= 'f':
                    new_keys |= (1 << (ord(cell) - ord('a')))
                
                # If the cell contains a lock, check if we have the key
                if 'A' <= cell <= 'F' and not (keys & (1 << (ord(cell) - ord('A')))):
                    continue
                
                if (nx, ny, new_keys) not in visited:
                    visited.add((nx, ny, new_keys))
                    queue.append((nx, ny, steps + 1, new_keys))
    
    return -1
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is primarily driven by the BFS exploration:
- Time complexity: \(O(m \times n \times 2^K)\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are the dimensions of the grid and \(K\) is the number of keys.
- Space complexity: \(O(m \times n \times 2^K)\), due to the queue and the visited set.

This should be feasible given the constraints \(1 \leq m, n \leq 30\) and \(K \leq 6\).
