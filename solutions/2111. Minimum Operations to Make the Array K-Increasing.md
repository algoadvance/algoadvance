title:  Minimum Operations to Make the Array K-Increasing-out
permalink: /s2111
---

The problem "Minimum Operations to Make the Array K-Increasing" on LeetCode is defined as follows:

Given an array `arr` and an integer `k`, your goal is to make the array `k-increasing`. 
An array is `k-increasing` if `arr[i] <= arr[i+k]` for every valid `i`. 

You can change any number of elements in the array and should return the minimum number of operations required to make the array `k-increasing`. 

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What are the constraints on the length of `arr`?
   - What are the constraints on the value of `k` and the elements in `arr`?

2. **Output**:
   - Should the function return the count of the minimum operations required to make the array `k-increasing` as an integer?

## Example

Let's consider an array `arr = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` and `k = 2`. The goal is to make the array `k-increasing`. 

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can break it down into the following steps:

1. **Divide the Array into k Sequences**:
   - We partition the array into k subsequences based on their indices modulo k. 
   - For example, for `arr = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]` and `k = 2`, the subsequences would be: 
     - Sequence 1: [5, 3, 1] (indices 0, 2, 4)
     - Sequence 2: [4, 2] (indices 1, 3)

2. **Apply Longest Non-Decreasing Subsequence (LNDS)**:
   - For each subsequence, we find the length of its longest non-decreasing subsequence using dynamic programming.
   - The minimum number of changes required to make each subsequence non-decreasing is the difference between the length of the subsequence and the length of its LNDS.

3. **Sum Up the Changes**:
   - The total number of operations needed will be the sum of the required changes for each subsequence.

Now, let's move to the code implementation.

## Code

```python
def length_of_LNDS(array):
    import bisect
    lnds = []
    for num in array:
        pos = bisect.bisect_right(lnds, num)
        if pos < len(lnds):
            lnds[pos] = num
        else:
            lnds.append(num)
    return len(lnds)

def minOperations(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    total_changes = 0
    for i in range(k):
        subsequence = [arr[j] for j in range(i, n, k)]
        len_lnds = length_of_LNDS(subsequence)
        total_changes += len(subsequence) - len_lnds
    return total_changes

# Example usage
arr = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
k = 2
print(minOperations(arr, k))  # Output: 4
```

## Time Complexity

- **Length of LNDS Function**: Finding the LNDS using binary search in a list takes O(n log n) time complexity, where n is the length of the sequence.
- **Total Time Complexity**: Dividing the array into k subsequences is O(n). For each subsequence, finding the LNDS takes O((n/k) log (n/k)), leading to a total complexity of O(n log (n/k)) which simplifies to O(n log n) when summed for all k subsequences.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is **O(n log n)**.
