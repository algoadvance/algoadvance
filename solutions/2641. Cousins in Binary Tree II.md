title:  Cousins in Binary Tree II-out
permalink: /s2641
---
Given the root of a binary tree, replace the value of each node in the tree with the sum of the values of all nodes in the same level except the value of the node itself. In other words, replace each node in the tree with the sum all values of other nodes at the same level.

Return the root of the modified tree.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is this a binary tree or can it be any type of tree?**
   - The problem specifies that it is a binary tree.

2. **Can the node values be negative?**
   - Typically, node values can be negative, zero, or positive unless otherwise specified.

3. **Is there a limit on the number of nodes in the tree?**
   - Unless otherwise mentioned, assume the structure can be any size that fits in memory.

4. **Do we need to handle invalid inputs like a null root?**
   - Assume root is never null as per common coding problem setups.

### Strategy
1. **Level Order Traversal**: Use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse the tree level-by-level. This allows us to gather all nodes at each level and calculate the required sums.
2. **Sum Calculation**: For each level, calculate the sum of the node values. Then, for each node at that level, update its value to the level sum minus its original value.
3. **Queue for BFS**: Use a queue to assist in the BFS traversal.

### Code
Below is the Python code implementing the above strategy:

```python
from collections import deque

# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def replaceValueInTree(root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
    if not root:
        return None

    queue = deque([root])

    # Perform BFS to traverse the tree level-by-level
    while queue:
        level_size = len(queue)
        level_sum = 0
        level_nodes = []

        # First pass to calculate the sum and collect nodes of the current level
        for _ in range(level_size):
            node = queue.popleft()
            level_sum += node.val
            level_nodes.append(node)

            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)

        # Second pass to update each node's value
        for node in level_nodes:
            node.val = level_sum - node.val

    return root
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because each node is visited once during the BFS traversal.
- **Space Complexity**: O(w), where w is the maximum width of the binary tree (the maximum number of nodes at any level). This is the maximum possible size of the queue during the BFS traversal.

This approach ensures that each node is updated with the correct value based on the sum of its level excluding its original value.
