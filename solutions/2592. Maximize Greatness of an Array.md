title:  Maximize Greatness of an Array-out
permalink: /s2592
---

You are given an array `nums`. The "greatness" of the array is defined as the number of elements `nums[i]` such that `nums[i] > nums[j]` for some `j` with `i != j`. You are allowed to permute the array anyway you want. Return the maximum possible greatness of the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input array contain negative numbers or zeros?**
   - Yes, the input array can contain any integer values including zeros and negative numbers.
2. **Is there a limit on the size of the input array?**
   - The problem does not specify a limit, but typically constraints would be given such as 1 <= len(nums) <= 10^5.

### Strategy

To maximize the "greatness" of the array, we need to maximize the number of elements `nums[i]` such that `nums[i] > nums[j]` for some `j`. This can be done through the following approach:

1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting will help in easily comparing and maximizing the number of valid pairs.
2. **Use Two Pointers**: 
   - One pointer will traverse from the beginning to the end, trying to maximize the current element's greatness by finding the next greater element.
   - Another pointer will help to identify the next greater element.

### Solution and Time Complexity

```python
def maximizeGreatness(nums):
    nums.sort()
    i, j, count = 0, 1, 0
    while j < len(nums) and i < len(nums):
        if nums[j] > nums[i]:
            count += 1
            i += 1
        j += 1
    return count
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the Array**: \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Two Pointers Traversal**: \(O(n)\)

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

This approach ensures each element is part of a combination where it is greater than some other element, thereby effectively maximizing the "greatness" of the array.
