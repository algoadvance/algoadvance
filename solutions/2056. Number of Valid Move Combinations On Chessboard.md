title:  Number of Valid Move Combinations On Chessboard-out
permalink: /s2056
---

You are given the starting positions and movement ranges of two chess pieces on an 8x8 chessboard: a rook and a bishop. Each piece can make from zero to the maximum number of moves allowed in their movement range. You need to determine the number of distinct sequences of moves both pieces can make such that they end up at a specified position (target).

- A rook can move any number of squares along a row or column.
- A bishop can move any number of squares diagonally.

Given the starting positions of the rook and bishop, their movement ranges, and the target position, count the number of valid move sequences such that both pieces end up at the target position.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the movements constrained by board edges?**
   - Yes, the pieces cannot move outside the 8x8 chessboard.
   
2. **Do the pieces move simultaneously or sequentially?**
   - The problem is simpler if we consider moves independently and then combine valid sequences.
   
3. **Is there any interaction between the rook and the bishop during their moves?**
   - No interaction is mentioned, so we will assume they can move without affecting each other.

4. **What are the specific inputs?**
   - `rook_position`: Tuple (r1, c1) indicating the starting position of the rook.
   - `rook_range`: Integer indicating the maximum range the rook can move.
   - `bishop_position`: Tuple (b1, d1) indicating the starting position of the bishop.
   - `bishop_range`: Integer indicating the maximum range the bishop can move.
   - `target`: Tuple (tr, tc) indicating the target position for both pieces.
   
## Strategy

1. **Enumerate possible moves for the rook**:
   - Generate all valid target positions the rook can reach within its movement range.
   
2. **Enumerate possible moves for the bishop**:
   - Generate all valid target positions the bishop can reach within its movement range.
   
3. **Count the number of valid move sequences**:
   - Check if both rook and bishop can reach the target on any valid move sequence.

## Code

```python
def is_valid_position(x, y):
    return 0 <= x < 8 and 0 <= y < 8

def enumerate_rook_moves(rook_position, rook_range, target):
    r1, c1 = rook_position
    tr, tc = target
    valid_moves = 0
    
    if r1 == tr:
        if abs(c1 - tc) <= rook_range:
            valid_moves += 1
    if c1 == tc:
        if abs(r1 - tr) <= rook_range:
            valid_moves += 1
    
    return valid_moves

def enumerate_bishop_moves(bishop_position, bishop_range, target):
    b1, d1 = bishop_position
    tr, tc = target
    valid_moves = 0
    
    if abs(b1 - tr) == abs(d1 - tc) and abs(b1 - tr) <= bishop_range:
        valid_moves += 1
    
    return valid_moves

def count_valid_move_combinations(rook_position, rook_range, bishop_position, bishop_range, target):
    rook_valid_moves = enumerate_rook_moves(rook_position, rook_range, target)
    bishop_valid_moves = enumerate_bishop_moves(bishop_position, bishop_range, target)
    
    return rook_valid_moves * bishop_valid_moves

# Example usage:
rook_position = (2, 3)
rook_range = 4
bishop_position = (5, 6)
bishop_range = 3
target = (2, 6)

print(count_valid_move_combinations(rook_position, rook_range, bishop_position, bishop_range, target))  # Output should be 1 if both pieces can reach the target; 0 otherwise
```

## Time Complexity

- **Rook Moves Enumeration**:
  - Checking row and column constraints for the rook is O(1).
  
- **Bishop Moves Enumeration**:
  - Validating diagonal constraint for the bishop is O(1).
  
Thus, the total time complexity is O(1), which is very efficient. Each piece's movement constraints are checked individually, and we simply multiply their valid move counts to obtain the final result.
