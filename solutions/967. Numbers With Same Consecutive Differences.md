title:  Numbers With Same Consecutive Differences-out
permalink: /s967
---
You are given two integers `n` and `k`. A number is called `good` if it has `n` digits and all its consecutive digits have an absolute difference of `k`.

Return a list of all `good` integers as strings in ascending order. Note that every number in the answer must not have leading zeros except for the number `0` itself.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of values for `n` and `k`?**
   - Typically, `1 <= n <= 9` and `0 <= k <= 9`.
   
2. **Can `n` be 1?**
   - Yes, in which case all single-digit numbers `0` to `9` are considered valid.

3. **Are negative numbers allowed?**
   - No, the problem implicitly deals with non-negative integers only.

### Strategy
1. **Backtracking / DFS Approach:**
   - We can use a depth-first search (DFS) approach to build the required numbers.
   - Start with each digit from `1` to `9` and perform a DFS to form numbers of length `n`.
   - Add digits to the current number such that the absolute difference between consecutive digits is `k`.
   
2. **Base Case:**
   - If `n` is reduced to `1`, simply return the digits `0` through `9` (since they are valid single-digit numbers).

3. **Recursive Step:**
   - Add a digit such that the absolute difference with the previous digit is `k`.
   - Continue this process until the number reaches the desired length `n`.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Handle the case where `k` is `0` separately, as the difference being `0` means consecutive digits are the same.
   - Ensure numbers do not have leading zeros.

### Code
Here's the Python implementation based on the outlined strategy:

```python
def numsSameConsecDiff(n, k):
    if n == 1:
        return [str(i) for i in range(10)]
    
    results = []
    
    def dfs(num, remaining_digits):
        if remaining_digits == 0:
            results.append(num)
            return
        
        last_digit = int(num[-1])
        
        # Possibilities for next digit
        next_digits = set()
        if last_digit + k <= 9:
            next_digits.add(last_digit + k)
        if last_digit - k >= 0:
            next_digits.add(last_digit - k)
        
        for next_digit in next_digits:
            dfs(num + str(next_digit), remaining_digits - 1)
    
    # Start DFS from each number 1 through 9
    for start_digit in range(1, 10):
        dfs(str(start_digit), n - 1)
    
    return sorted(results)

# Example usage:
print(numsSameConsecDiff(3, 7)) # This should output numbers of 3 digits where consecutive digits have a diff of 7
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(2^n)
  - In the worst case, each digit can lead to two possible next digits, leading to at most \(2^n\) combinations.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - The maximum depth of the recursion stack will be `n`.

In this approach, we ensure that all valid numbers are generated as per the constraints and rules given in the problem statement.
