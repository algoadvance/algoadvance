title:  Find the Integer Added to Array II-out
permalink: /s3132
---

You have been given two arrays, `original` and `changed`, where `changed` is a permutation of the elements in `original` with one integer added one or more times. Your task is to identify this integer.

Implement a function `find_added_integer(original: List[int], changed: List[int]) -> int` that returns the integer which has been added.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the arrays sorted?**
   - No, the arrays may not be sorted.
   
2. **Can there be negative integers in the arrays?**
   - Yes, since the permission of the array can have negative integers.

3. **Can we assume that the added integer appears at least once in the `changed` array?**
   - Yes, the added integer will appear since `changed` has more elements than `original`.
   
4. **What is the maximum length of the arrays?**
   - This will impact our decision on time complexity but let's assume it can be up to 10^5.

With these in mind, let's proceed to formulating the strategy.

## Strategy

1. **Use Counting Method**:
   - We can use a `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each number in both `original` and `changed`.
   - The integer whose frequency in `changed` exceeds its frequency in `original` by at least 1 is the added integer.

## Code

```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

def find_added_integer(original: List[int], changed: List[int]) -> int:
    count_original = Counter(original)
    count_changed = Counter(changed)
    
    for num in count_changed:
        if count_changed[num] != count_original[num]:
            return num

# Example usage:
original = [4, 3, 2, 7, 9]
changed = [4, 3, 2, 7, 9, 7]
print(find_added_integer(original, changed))  # Output should be 7
```

## Explanation

1. **Count Frequencies**:
   - We use `Counter` to count the frequency of each integer in both `original` and `changed`.

2. **Identify the Added Integer**:
   - Loop through the `changed` counts and for each number, check if its count differs from the count in the `original` array. The integer which appears more times in `changed` is the added integer.

## Time Complexity

- The overall time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the `changed` array. This is because:
  - Counting elements takes O(n).
  - The comparison loop also takes O(n).

Thus, the approach is efficient for large input sizes.
