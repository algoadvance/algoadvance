You are given a robot that can walk in a 2D grid. The robot has specific movement rules, and it can perform movements based on given commands. Here's a detailed breakdown of the operations this robot can perform:

- Initially, the robot is at coordinate (0, 0) and facing "East".
- The grid has dimensions `width` (columns) and `height` (rows).

You need to implement a robot that can:
- Move a specified number of steps forward.
- Return its current position.
- Return its current facing direction.

**Class Definition:**
```python
class Robot:
    def __init__(self, width: int, height: int):
        pass

    def step(self, num: int) -> None:
        pass

    def getPos(self) -> [int, int]:
        pass

    def getDir(self) -> str:
        pass
```
- `__init__(self, width: int, height: int)`: Initializes the robot's environment.
- `step(self, num: int)`: Moves the robot forward by a specified number of steps.
- `getPos(self) -> [int, int]`: Returns the robot's current position as a list `[x, y]`.
- `getDir(self) -> str`: Returns the robot's current direction as a string ("East", "North", "West", "South").

### Clarifying Questions
1. What happens if the robot is supposed to move more steps than the perimeter of the grid?
   - The robot continues to move and wraps around the grid.
2. How should the robot behave at the grid boundaries?
   - The robot continues to move along the boundary and wraps around the grid if needed.

### Strategy
1. Calculate the perimeter of the grid: `perimeter = 2 * (width + height) - 4`.
2. Normalize any move to within the perimeter using modulus operation: `effective steps = num % perimeter`.
3. Use direction and position updates to handle movements.
4. Use a list of directions `["East", "North", "West", "South"]` and index positions to trace current directions.
5. Initialize the robot at position `(0, 0)` facing "East".

### Code
Let's implement the class with the described functionality:

```python
class Robot:
    def __init__(self, width: int, height: int):
        self.width = width
        self.height = height
        self.perimeter = 2 * (width + height) - 4
        self.directions = ["East", "North", "West", "South"]
        self.x, self.y = 0, 0
        self.dir_index = 0 # Facing "East"

    def step(self, num: int) -> None:
        num = num % self.perimeter
        
        while num > 0:
            if self.dir_index == 0: # East
                step = min(num, self.width - 1 - self.x)
                self.x += step
            elif self.dir_index == 1: # North
                step = min(num, self.height - 1 - self.y)
                self.y += step
            elif self.dir_index == 2: # West
                step = min(num, self.x)
                self.x -= step
            elif self.dir_index == 3: # South
                step = min(num, self.y)
                self.y -= step
            
            num -= step

            if num > 0: # Change direction if there are still steps remaining
                self.dir_index = (self.dir_index + 1) % 4

    def getPos(self) -> [int, int]:
        return [self.x, self.y]

    def getDir(self) -> str:
        return self.directions[self.dir_index]

# Example usage
# robot = Robot(6, 3)
# robot.step(2)
# print(robot.getPos())  # [2, 0]
# print(robot.getDir())  # "East"
# robot.step(2)
# print(robot.getPos())  # [4, 0]
# print(robot.getDir())  # "East"
# robot.step(2)
# print(robot.getPos())  # [5, 0]
# print(robot.getDir())  # "East"
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization (`__init__`)**: O(1)
- **Step Movement (`step`)**: O(k), where k is `num % perimeter`. Effectively, the robot only moves proportionally to the number of steps modulo the grid perimeter.
- **Get Position (`getPos`)**: O(1)
- **Get Direction (`getDir`)**: O(1)

This ensures that all operations are efficient and handle boundary conditions correctly.
