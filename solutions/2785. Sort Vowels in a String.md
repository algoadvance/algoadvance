LeetCode Problem 2785 - Sort Vowels in a String-out:

You are given a string `s`. Reorder the vowels and consonants in such a way that all vowels (a, e, i, o, u) appear in sorted ascending order followed by all consonants whilst maintaining their original order of appearance.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Case Sensitivity**: Should the solution take into account the difference between uppercase and lowercase vowels?
   - Yes, let's assume the problem needs to handle vowels in a case-insensitive manner.
   
2. **Allowed Characters**: Are there any constraints on the characters (e.g., only alphabetical characters)?
   - The problem mostly focuses on handling vowels and consonants, so assume the input consists of English letters only.

3. **Empty String**: Should the solution handle empty strings?
   - Yes, return an empty string if the input is empty.

4. **Example Cases**: 
   - Input: `"hello"`
     - Vowels: `e, o` -> Sorted: `e, o`
     - Output: `"elloh"`
   - Input: `"leetcode"`
     - Vowels: `e, e, o, e` -> Sorted: `e, e, e, o`
     - Output: `"leetcede"`

### Strategy

1. **Identify Vowels and Consonants**:
   - Traverse through the string and extract vowels into one list and consonants into another list.

2. **Sorting**:
   - Sort the list of vowels in ascending order.
   
3. **Reconstruct String**:
   - Iterate through the original string and replace vowels with sorted vowels, reconstructing the original string structure with vowels in sorted order.

### Code

Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def sortVowels(s: str) -> str:
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    
    # Step 1: Extract vowels and sort them
    vowels_in_s = [ch for ch in s if ch in vowels]
    vowels_in_s.sort()

    # Step 2: Reconstruct the string with sorted vowels
    sorted_vowel_idx = 0
    result = []
    for ch in s:
        if ch in vowels:
            result.append(vowels_in_s[sorted_vowel_idx])
            sorted_vowel_idx += 1
        else:
            result.append(ch)
    
    return ''.join(result)

# Example usage
print(sortVowels("hello"))     # Output: "elloh"
print(sortVowels("leetcode"))  # Output: "leetcede"
```

### Time Complexity

- **Extracting Vowels**: O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`.
- **Sorting Vowels**: O(k log k), where k is the number of vowels.
- **Reconstructing String**: O(n).

Hence, the total time complexity is **O(n + k log k)**.
