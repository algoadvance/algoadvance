title:  Split Strings by Separator-out
permalink: /s2788
---
You have been provided with a list of strings and a separator character. Your task is to write a function that splits each string in the list by the given separator and returns a list of the split strings, but excludes any empty strings from the output.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of the lengths for the input list and strings?
   - Are there any restrictions on the characters in the strings or the separator?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - How should we handle cases where the separator does not appear in the string?
   - How should we handle cases where the entire string is empty or only consists of separator characters?

### Code:

```python
def split_strings_by_separator(strings, separator):
    result = []
    for s in strings:
        parts = s.split(separator)
        for part in parts:
            if part:  # ignore empty strings
                result.append(part)
    return result

# Example usage:
strings = ["hello|world", "foo|bar|baz", "a|||b||c"]
separator = "|"
print(split_strings_by_separator(strings, separator))  # Output: ['hello', 'world', 'foo', 'bar', 'baz', 'a', 'b', 'c']
```

### Strategy:
1. **Initialization:** Start with an empty list `result` to store the non-empty strings after splitting.
2. **Iterate Over Strings:** For each string in the input list:
   - Split the string by the given separator, which results in a list of parts.
   - Iterate over each part and add it to the `result` list only if it is non-empty.
3. **Return the Result:** After processing all strings, return the `result` list.

### Time Complexity:
- **Splitting Each String:** Splitting a string by a separator takes O(n) time, where n is the length of the string.
- **Iterating Over All Strings:** Suppose there are m strings in the list and the average length of each string is n, then splitting all strings will take O(m * n) time.
- **Total Time Complexity:** O(m * n), which is efficient for reasonably sized input lengths.

This approach ensures that we handle a variety of cases, including strings without the separator, completely empty strings, and strings with consecutive separator characters.
