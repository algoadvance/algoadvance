title:  Maximum Ascending Subarray Sum-out
permalink: /s1800
---
You are given an integer array `nums`. A subarray of `nums` is called an ascending subarray if it is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements such that for all `i`, `nums[i] < nums[i + 1]`. The sum of an ascending subarray is the sum of its elements.

Return the maximum sum of any ascending subarray.

Example:
```
Input: nums = [10, 20, 30, 5, 10, 50]
Output: 65
Explanation: [10, 20, 30] and [5, 10, 50] are the two ascending subarrays with the maximum sum of 60 and 65 respectively. Thus, we return 65.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can `nums` contain negative numbers? 
   - Yes, the array can contain negative numbers.
2. What should be returned if `nums` is empty?
   - If `nums` is empty, the function should return 0.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we will use the following approach:

1. Initialize two variables: 
   - `max_sum` to store the maximum sum found so far, initialized to 0 (or to the first element if `nums` is not empty).
   - `current_sum` to store the sum of the current ascending subarray, initialized to 0.

2. Iterate through each element in the array:
   - If the current element is greater than the previous element, add it to `current_sum`.
   - If it is not, compare `current_sum` with `max_sum` to keep track of the maximum sum found so far, then reset `current_sum` to the current element.

3. After finishing the loop, there might still be an unsaved `current_sum` since the last subarray might be the maximum ascending one. Compare and save it if necessary.

4. Return the `max_sum`.

## Code
Here is the Python code implementing the above strategy:

```python
def maxAscendingSum(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0

    max_sum = 0
    current_sum = nums[0]

    for i in range(1, nums.length):
        if nums[i] > nums[i - 1]:
            current_sum += nums[i]
        else:
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
            current_sum = nums[i]

    max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    return max_sum

# Example usage
nums = [10, 20, 30, 5, 10, 50]
print(maxAscendingSum(nums)) # Output: 65
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because we iterate through the array exactly once. The space complexity is \(O(1)\) because we use a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
