title:  Maximum Value Sum by Placing Three Rooks II-out
permalink: /s3257
---

Given a 2D matrix of integers, you are to place three rooks on this chessboard in such a way that no two rooks can attack each other (i.e., no two rooks can be on the same row or the same column). Your goal is to determine the maximum possible sum of the values at the positions where the rooks are placed.

**Example**:
```
Input:
matrix = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]

Output:
24
```

In this example, the optimal placement of the rooks would be at positions (0, 2), (1, 1), and (2, 0) giving a sum of 3 + 5 + 7 = 15.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Matrix Size**: What constraints exist regarding the size of the matrix (e.g., `n x n`, any dimensions)?
2. **Negative Values**: Can the matrix contain negative values?
3. **Matrix Bounds**: What are the minimum and maximum possible values in the matrix?

### Strategy

1. **Identify All Possible Combinations**: Generate all possible combinations of 3 rows and 3 columns.
2. **Permutations of Selection**: For each combination of rows and columns, calculate the sum of their permutations.
3. **Optimize for Maximum Sum**: Track the maximum sum encountered during the permutations evaluation.

### Steps

1. Obtain all combinations of 3 rows and 3 columns from the matrix.
2. For each combination, use permutations to avoid rooks attacking each other.
3. Calculate the value sum for each permutation and store the maximum sum.

### Time Complexity

1. **Combination Generation**: Generating the combinations of 3 rows from `n` rows and 3 columns from `m` columns is `C(n, 3) * C(m, 3)`.
2. **Permutations for Each Combination**: Evaluating each permutation of 3 elements has `3!` (6) permutations.
3. **Overall Complexity**: The overall time complexity is `O(C(n, 3) * C(m, 3) * 3!)`.

### Code

```python
from itertools import combinations, permutations

def max_value_sum(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    m = len(matrix[0])
    
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    
    # Generate all combinations of selecting 3 rows and 3 columns
    row_combinations = combinations(range(n), 3)
    col_combinations = combinations(range(m), 3)
    
    for rows in row_combinations:
        for cols in col_combinations:
            # Evaluate all permutations of selected rows and columns
            for perm in permutations(zip(rows, cols)):
                current_sum = sum(matrix[row][col] for row, col in perm)
                max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    
    return max_sum

# Example usage
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
print(max_value_sum(matrix))  # Output: 24
```

This code defines a function `max_value_sum` that computes the maximum sum of the values of the positions where the rooks can be placed such that no two rooks attack each other. It uses combinatorial approaches to find the optimal solution.
