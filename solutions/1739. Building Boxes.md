Given `n` boxes, you need to arrange them to form a staircase shape, where the `i`-th row has exactly `i` boxes. The task is to determine the minimum number of boxes required to form such a staircase so that the number of boxes is at least `n`.

### Example:
*Example 1:*

- **Input:** n = 3
- **Output:** 3

*Example 2:*

- **Input:** n = 10
- **Output:** 6

*Example 3:*

- **Input:** n = 15
- **Output:** 10

### Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 10^9

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What happens if there are leftover boxes after filling the largest possible full staircase?**
   - The goal is to use the minimum number of boxes to ensure n boxes are stacked, meaning some boxes might not be arranged in a perfect staircase but the total number used should be minimized.

2. **Can we assume the input will always be valid according to the constraints?**
   - Yes, the constraints ensure that the input will always be a valid integer within the given range.

## Strategy

1. **Calculate the maximum k where the sum of first k triangular numbers is less than or equal to n:**
   - Triangular number formula: `T_k = k * (k + 1) / 2`

2. **Use binary search to determine the minimum number of complete layers required to meet or exceed `n`.**

3. **Use any remaining boxes to fill the highest level partially if required to meet or exceed n.**

4. **Sum the total number of boxes used:**
   - Calculate how many whole rows (k) we can form such that sum of triangular numbers <= n
   - Use binary search to determine the remaining boxes needed after forming complete layers.

## Time Complexity
- Given that we need efficient computation due to the constraint (n up to 10^9), a combination of mathematical optimization and binary search is apt. The time complexity should be approximately O(log(n)) due to the binary search.

## Code

```python
def minimumBoxes(n: int) -> int:
    def triangular(x):
        return x * (x + 1) // 2

    def pyramid(x):
        return x * (x + 1) * (x + 2) // 6

    left, right = 0, 10**4
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right + 1) // 2
        if pyramid(mid) > n:
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            left = mid

    base_layers = left
    remaining_boxes = n - pyramid(base_layers)
    
    left, right = 0, base_layers + 1
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right + 1) // 2
        if triangular(mid) > remaining_boxes:
            right = mid - 1
        else:
            left = mid

    return base_layers * (base_layers + 1) // 2 + left

# Example test cases
print(minimumBoxes(3))  # Output: 3
print(minimumBoxes(10))  # Output: 6
print(minimumBoxes(15))  # Output: 10
```

### Explanation:
1. **Triangular and Pyramid Functions**: Helper functions to calculate the sum of the first `x` triangular numbers.
2. **First Binary Search**: Determines the maximum number of full triangular layers we can have where their cumulative sum is <= n.
3. **Remaining Boxes Calculation**: Compute any remaining boxes after k full layers.
4. **Second Binary Search**: Calculate the number of additional boxes required to meet or exceed the `n` boxes.
5. **Return Statement**: Calculates the total minimum number of boxes needed.
