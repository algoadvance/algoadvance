title:  Find the Duplicate Number-out
permalink: /s287
---

You are given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive. There is only one repeated number in `nums`, return this repeated number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array `nums` and uses only constant extra space.

### Example:

Input: `nums = [1, 3, 4, 2, 2]`  
Output: `2`

Input: `nums = [3, 1, 3, 4, 2]`  
Output: `3`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can nums contain negative numbers or zero?**

   - No, each integer is in the range `[1, n]`.

2. **Is it guaranteed that there is exactly one duplicate number in the array?**

   - Yes, it is guaranteed that there is only one repeated number.

3. **Can I modify the input array?**

   - No, the array should not be modified.

## Strategy

We can use Floyd's Tortoise and Hare (Cycle Detection) to solve this problem with `O(n)` time complexity and `O(1)` space complexity:

1. **Phase 1**: Detect Intersection Point:
   - Initialize two pointers: `slow` and `fast`.
   - Move `slow` by one step, and `fast` by two steps until they meet. This meeting point will be within the cycle.

2. **Phase 2**: Find the entrance to the cycle, which is the duplicate number:
   - Move `slow` to the start of the array and keep `fast` at the meeting point.
   - Move both pointers by one step until they meet again. This meeting point is the entrance to the cycle, i.e., the duplicate number.

## Code

```python
def findDuplicate(nums):
    # Phase 1: Detect Intersection Point
    slow = nums[0]
    fast = nums[0]
    
    while True:
        slow = nums[slow]
        fast = nums[nums[fast]]
        if slow == fast:
            break
    
    # Phase 2: Find the entrance to the cycle
    slow = nums[0]
    while slow != fast:
        slow = nums[slow]
        fast = nums[fast]
    
    return slow
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` because each step through the loop takes constant time, and the number of steps is proportional to the size of the input array.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` because we are using a fixed amount of extra space for the pointers `slow` and `fast`.
