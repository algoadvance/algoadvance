title:  Finding Pairs With a Certain Sum-out
permalink: /s1865
---

Given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, implement a class `FindSumPairs` that supports the following operations:

1. `FindSumPairs(nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int])`:
    - Constructor method which initializes the object with the two given integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`.

2. `void add(index: int, val: int)`:
    - Adds `val` to `nums2[index]`, i.e., increment `nums2[index]` by `val`.

3. `int count(tot: int)`:
    - Return the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that `nums1[i] + nums2[j]` equals `tot`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Will the array sizes of `nums1` and `nums2` fit into memory comfortably, or should we be concerned about extremely large sizes?**
   - For simplicity, we assume array sizes are manageable within memory constraints.

2. **Are there any constraints on the values within `nums1` or `nums2` (e.g., value ranges)?**
   - We assume the values are within typical bounds of integers.

3. **Will there be any constraints on the number of operations performed (constructor calls, add operations, count operations)?**
   - The problem does not specify constraints here, so we assume a reasonable number of operations.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Store `nums1` and a modified version of `nums2` where the array can be modified but also quickly used for lookups.
2. **Addition Operation**: Modify the value at the specified index in `nums2`, and update a hashmap that keeps the count of each number in `nums2`.
3. **Count Operation**: For each value in `nums1`, calculate the complement needed in `nums2` to reach the target sum. Use the hashmap to get count occurrences efficiently.

### Code

```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

class FindSumPairs:
    def __init__(self, nums1: List[int], nums2: List[int]):
        self.nums1 = nums1
        self.nums2 = nums2
        self.nums2_count = Counter(nums2)

    def add(self, index: int, val: int) -> None:
        # Remove the previous count of nums2[index] from the Counter
        self.nums2_count[self.nums2[index]] -= 1
        if self.nums2_count[self.nums2[index]] == 0:
            del self.nums2_count[self.nums2[index]]

        # Update nums2 index with val
        self.nums2[index] += val

        # Add the new count of this element to the Counter
        self.nums2_count[self.nums2[index]] += 1

    def count(self, tot: int) -> int:
        count_pairs = 0
        for num in self.nums1:
            complement = tot - num
            if complement in self.nums2_count:
                count_pairs += self.nums2_count[complement]
        return count_pairs
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Initialization** (`__init__`):
   - Creating a `Counter` for `nums2` involves iterating over `nums2`, so the time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of `nums2`.
   
2. **Addition Operation** (`add`):
   - Updating the counter and the specific element in `nums2` takes \(O(1)\) time.

3. **Count Operation** (`count`):
   - Iterates over each element in `nums1` and looks up the counter, so the time complexity is \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the length of `nums1`.

Thus, the operations are efficient and suitable for typical usage scenarios within the problem constraints.
