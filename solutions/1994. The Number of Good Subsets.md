title:  The Number of Good Subsets-out
permalink: /s1994
---

Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of *good subsets*. A *good subset* is a subset of `nums` such that the product of its elements is a *square-free number* (i.e., it is divisible by no square number other than `1`). Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

A *subset* of an array is a selection of elements (possibly none) of the array such that the unselected elements remain in their relative order.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the input size?**
   - Typically, constraints for `nums` are given. For example, `1 <= nums.length <= 1000` and `1 <= nums[i] <= 30`.

2. **What do we mean by "square-free number"?**
   - A *square-free number* is a number that is not divisible by any perfect square other than 1. This means it should not include any prime factor raised to a power of 2 or greater.

3. **Is there any specific constraint on the number elements or their value?**
   - The elements are usually constrained between `1` and `30` in problems like these because it is computationally feasible to check for square-free numbers within such a range.

## Strategy

To solve the problem, follow these steps:
1. **Count Frequency**: Count the frequency of each number in `nums`.
2. **Identify Square-free Constraints**:
   - Each number from 2 to 30 is pre-calculated to check if itâ€™s square-free.
   - Create a list of masks representing the square-free status of these numbers (bitmask form to keep track of prime factors efficiently).
3. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Use dynamic programming with bit manipulation to count the subsets that are square-free.
   - `dp[mask]` will represent the number of ways to pick subsets that correspond to the bitmask `mask`.
4. **Result Calculation**:
   - Using the DP table, calculate the final sum of all possible good subsets.
   - Return the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Code

```python
from functools import reduce
from collections import Counter

MOD = 10**9 + 7
PRIMES = [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29]

def prime_mask(x):
    mask = 0
    for i, p in enumerate(PRIMES):
        if x % (p * p) == 0:
            return -1  # not square-free
        if x % p == 0:
            mask |= 1 << i
    return mask

def numberOfGoodSubsets(nums):
    count = Counter(nums)
    dp = [1] + [0] * (1 << len(PRIMES))
    
    for x in range(2, 31):
        mask = prime_mask(x)
        if mask == -1 or count[x] == 0:
            continue
        for existing_mask in range(1 << len(PRIMES) - 1, -1, -1):
            if existing_mask & mask == 0:
                dp[existing_mask | mask] = (dp[existing_mask | mask] + dp[existing_mask] * count[x]) % MOD

    # We subtract 1 to exclude the empty subset
    result = (sum(dp) - 1) % MOD

    # Handle the contribution of '1's
    if 1 in count:
        result = result * pow(2, count[1], MOD) % MOD

    return result

# Example usage
nums = [4, 2, 3, 15]
print(numberOfGoodSubsets(nums))  # Example output: number of good subsets
```

## Time Complexity

- **Pre-calculation of Prime Masks**: `O(1)` for each number from `1` to `30` (effectively constant).
- **Dynamic Programming Updates**: For each possible number, update all subsets which will be `O(N * 2^10)` where `N` is the number of distinct square-free elements in `nums` (bounded by `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`).

Thus, the approach will be efficient given the problem constraints, and overall complexity remains manageable within the provided limits.
