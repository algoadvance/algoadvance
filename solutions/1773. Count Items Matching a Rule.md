title:  Count Items Matching a Rule-out
permalink: /s1773
---
You are given a list of `items`, where each `items[i] = [type_i, color_i, name_i]` describes the type, color, and name of the `i-th` item. You are also given a `ruleKey` and a `ruleValue`.

You need to return the number of items that match the given rule. The rule is defined as follows:
- If `ruleKey` is `"type"`, then you need to match `ruleValue` with the `type_i` of the items.
- If `ruleKey` is `"color"`, then you need to match `ruleValue` with the `color_i` of the items.
- If `ruleKey` is `"name"`, then you need to match `ruleValue` with the `name_i` of the items.

### Example 1
**Input:**
```plaintext
items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]]
ruleKey = "color"
ruleValue = "silver"
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
1
```

### Example 2
**Input:**
```plaintext
items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]]
ruleKey = "type"
ruleValue = "phone"
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
2
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the maximum size of `items` list?**
   - This would help in understanding if any performance optimization is needed.
2. **Are the values in `ruleKey` always among `type`, `color`, `name`?**
   - This ensures the validity of inputs.
3. **Is it guaranteed that `items` will have three components - `type, color, name`?**
   - To ensure consistent input for processing.

With these clarifications, we can proceed to solve the problem.

## Strategy
1. **Determine the Index to Compare:**
   - Map `ruleKey` to the corresponding index: "type" -> 0, "color" -> 1, "name" -> 2.
2. **Iterate Over Items:**
   - Count items where the element at the mapped index matches `ruleValue`.
3. **Return the Count:**
   - Output the total matching items count.

## Code
```python
def countMatches(items, ruleKey, ruleValue):
    # Mapping `ruleKey` to their respective index in the list
    key_to_index = {"type": 0, "color": 1, "name": 2}
    
    # Determine the index to be used for comparison
    index = key_to_index[ruleKey]
    
    # Count the matching items
    count = 0
    for item in items:
        if item[index] == ruleValue:
            count += 1
    
    return count

# Test examples
items1 = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]]
ruleKey1 = "color"
ruleValue1 = "silver"
print(countMatches(items1, ruleKey1, ruleValue1))  # Output: 1

items2 = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]]
ruleKey2 = "type"
ruleValue2 = "phone"
print(countMatches(items2, ruleKey2, ruleValue2))  # Output: 2
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of items. We iterate through the list once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), aside from the input list, we use only a few extra variables.

This approach efficiently counts the items matching the rule provided.
