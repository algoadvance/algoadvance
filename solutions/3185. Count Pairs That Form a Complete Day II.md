title:  Count Pairs That Form a Complete Day II-out
permalink: /s3185
---

You are given an integer array `time`. The array contains the time required in minutes for different tasks. A "complete day" is defined as 60 minutes. Your goal is to count all pairs of tasks where the sum of their durations is exactly 60 minutes.

You need to write a function `countPairs` that takes an array `time` as an argument and returns the number of pairs that form a complete day.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can a task pair with itself?**
    - No, each pair should consist of two distinct tasks.

2. **Is the input always valid and non-empty?**
    - Yes, you can assume the input array `time` will contain at least two elements.

3. **What should be the output if there are no such pairs?**
    - The function should return 0 in that case.

4. **Are there constraints on the values within the array?**
    - All elements in the array are positive integers.

### Strategy

1. **Use a Dictionary to Track Remainders:**
   - Create a dictionary to keep track of the remainders of the elements when divided by 60.
   
2. **Calculate Remainders and Find Pairs:**
   - For each element in the array, calculate its remainder when divided by 60.
   - If the remainder is `r`, a pair is found if there is an element whose remainder is `60 - r`.
   - Special cases include remainders of 0 and 30, as they need to pair with the same remainder.

3. **Count Pairs Efficiently:**
   - Use the dictionary to count the possible pairs efficiently without checking every possible pair explicitly.

4. **Return the Total Count:**
   - Sum up all valid pairs found during the traversal of the array.

### Code

```python
def countPairs(time):
    # Dictionary to keep track of counts of remainders
    remainder_count = {}
    count = 0
    
    for t in time:
        remainder = t % 60  # Calculate the remainder of current time
        complement = (60 - remainder) % 60  # Find the complement remainder that would make the sum 60
        
        # If the complement exists in the dictionary, it means we have found that many pairs
        if complement in remainder_count:
            count += remainder_count[complement]
        
        # Update the dictionary with the current remainder
        if remainder in remainder_count:
            remainder_count[remainder] += 1
        else:
            remainder_count[remainder] = 1
    
    return count
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - The solution involves a single pass through the array to calculate remainders and update counts, which is done in \(O(n)\) time, where \(n\) is the number of elements in the `time` array.

- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - The space utilized by the dictionary is bounded by the fixed number of possible remainders (0 through 59), which translates to \(O(1)\) additional space.

This solution effectively uses a dictionary to map remainders and calculate the count of pairs efficiently in linear time.
