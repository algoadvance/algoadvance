title:  Maximum Matching of Players With Trainers-out
permalink: /s2410
---

You are given two integer arrays `players` and `trainers`, where `players[i]` is the ability of the i-th player and `trainers[j]` is the ability of the j-th trainer.

A player i can be matched with trainer j if `players[i] <= trainers[j]`. Moreover, each player can be matched with at most one trainer and each trainer can be matched with at most one player.

Return the maximum number of matches that can be made.

Example 1:
```
Input: players = [4,7,9], trainers = [8,2,5,8]
Output: 2
Explanation: One of the ways we can match is as follows:
- players[0] can be matched with trainers[2] since 4 <= 5.
- players[1] can be matched with trainers[0] since 7 <= 8.
- players[2] cannot be matched with any trainers since 9 > 8.
We can match a maximum of 2 players.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: players = [1,1,1], trainers = [10,10,10]
Output: 3
Explanation: The trainer can match with any player and the players can match with any trainers.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are there any constraints on the size of the `players` and `trainers` arrays?
2. What is the range of values for the player and trainer abilities?

## Strategy

To approach this problem:
1. **Sort both arrays**: Sorting will help us efficiently match the smallest available player to the smallest capable available trainer.
2. **Use a two-pointer technique**: One pointer will iterate through the players and another through the trainers to find suitable matches.
3. **Matchmaking**: Start with the smallest player and trainer. If the player can be matched, move both pointers to the next player and trainer respectively. If not, only advance the trainer pointer to find one that can match the current player.

### Key Steps:
1. Sort the `players` and `trainers` arrays.
2. Initialize two pointers (`player_idx` and `trainer_idx`) both set to the start of their respective arrays.
3. Iterate through both arrays using the pointers, making matches and moving the pointers accordingly.
4. Count the number of successful matches and return this count.

### Time Complexity
- Sorting both arrays takes \(O(n \log n + m \log m)\) where \(n\) is the number of players and \(m\) is the number of trainers.
- The iterating process to match players with trainers takes \(O(n + m)\).
- Thus, overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n + m \log m)\).

## Code

Here is a Python solution implementing this strategy:

```python
def matchPlayersAndTrainers(players, trainers):
    # Step 1: Sort both players and trainers arrays
    players.sort()
    trainers.sort()
    
    # Step 2: Initialize pointers for both arrays
    player_idx = 0
    trainer_idx = 0
    match_count = 0
    
    # Step 3: Use two-pointer technique to find maximum matches
    while player_idx < len(players) and trainer_idx < len(trainers):
        if players[player_idx] <= trainers[trainer_idx]:
            # Found a match
            match_count += 1
            player_idx += 1
            trainer_idx += 1
        else:
            # Trainer is not strong enough, move to the next trainer
            trainer_idx += 1
    
    return match_count

# Example usage:
players = [4, 7, 9]
trainers = [8, 2, 5, 8]
print(matchPlayersAndTrainers(players, trainers))  # Output: 2
```

This solution effectively matches the maximum number of players with trainers using sorting and a two-pointer approach.
