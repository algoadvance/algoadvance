LeetCode Problem 793: **Preimage Size of Factorial Zeroes Function**

Let `f(x)` be the number of zeroes at the end of `x!` (x factorial). We define a function `f(x)` as follows:

- `f(x) = k` denotes the number of trailing zeroes in `x!`.

Given an integer `k`, you need to find how many non-negative integers `x` have the property that `f(x) = k`.

Return the number of such integers `x`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of k**: What is the range of `k`? (To understand if there are constraints that we need to consider for optimization.)
2. **Output specifics**: The problem specifies to return the number of such integers `x`. Is the output expected to be 0, 5, or some other consistent pattern?

## Strategy

### Key Insights:
1. **Trailing Zeroes in Factorial**: Trailing zeroes are produced by factors of 10, and since 10 = 2 * 5, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of times 5 is a factor in the sequence of numbers from 1 to `x`.
2. **f(x) Characteristics**:
   - To calculate the trailing zeroes of `x!`, count the factors of 5 in the sequence (since factors of 2 are always more than ample).
   - `f(x)` is a non-decreasing function, as adding more numbers to the factorial sequence can only produce equal or more trailing zeroes.

### Approach:
1. **Binary Search**: Utilize binary search to find the range of `x` where `f(x) = k`.
2. Find the smallest `x` where `f(x) = k` (let this be `x1`) and the largest `x` where `f(x) = k` (let this be `x2`).
3. If `x2` - `x1` + 1 == 5, return the count (indicating there are exactly 5 numbers producing the same trailing zeroes).

### Algorithm:
1. Define a helper function `f(x)` to calculate the number of trailing zeroes.
2. Use binary search to find the smallest and largest `x` where `f(x) = k`.
3. Calculate the difference between the found values to determine the count of `x`.

### Code:
```python
def preimageSizeFZF(k: int) -> int:
    def f(x):
        count = 0
        while x > 0:
            x //= 5
            count += x
        return count
    
    def binary_search(k):
        left, right = 0, 5 * (k + 1)
        while left < right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if f(mid) < k:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid
        return left
        
    left = binary_search(k)
    right = binary_search(k + 1)
    
    return right - left

# Example usage:
k = 5
print(preimageSizeFZF(k))  # Output: 0 or 5, depending on k value
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Binary Search**: Each binary search operation performs in `O(log(k))`.
- **Factorial Zero Calculation (`f(x)`)**: This operation runs in `O(log(x))` due to sequential division by 5.
- **Overall Complexity**: The composite operations result in a time complexity of `O(log(k) * log(x))`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the required range for `x` values that satisfy the conditions, leveraging the characteristics of factorial trailing zeroes and binary search.
