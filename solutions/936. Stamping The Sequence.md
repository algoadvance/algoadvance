title:  Stamping The Sequence-out

### Problem Statement
You are given two strings `stamp` and `target`. Initially, there is a string `target` of length `n` consisting of `n` `?` characters. You move through `target` and replace all `?` characters with characters from `stamp`: this is called stamping the sub-window of `target` that matches `stamp`.

In one move, you can:
1. Choose `stamp` and `target` strings.
2. Pick a sub-component `target` of the same length as `stamp` and replace each character within `target` with `?`.

Return an array of integers representing the sequence of stamping moves to convert `target` into a string of only `?` characters. If it's not possible, return an empty array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What characters are allowed in `stamp` and `target`?**
   - Both `stamp` and `target` consist of lowercase alphabetical characters.
   
2. **What is the length range of `stamp` and `target`?**
   - Typically, `stamp` length is between 1 and 1000 and `target` length is between 1 and 1000.

3. **Does the sequence of moves need to be minimized?**
   - Yes, the goal is to minimize the number of moves.

### Strategy
1. **Goal**: Convert `target` into a string of only `?` characters with minimal moves.
2. **Approach**:
   - View the problem as a reverse process: instead of stamping into `target`, assume `target` becomes `?` step by step.
   - Simulate transforming `target` into `stamp` at possible positions using a greedy approach to find the sequence of moves.
   - Track parts of `target` that can be converted into `?` without violating the rule.
   - Continue this until `target` is fully transformed.

### Code

```python
def movesToStamp(stamp, target):
    # Initialize variables
    M, N = len(stamp), len(target)
    target = list(target)  # Convert target to list to mutate characters in place
    result = []
    count = 0
    visited = [False] * (N - M + 1)
    
    # Helper function to check if we can stamp
    def can_stamp(pos):
        for i in range(M):
            elif target[pos + i] != '?' and target[pos + i] != stamp[i]:
                return False
        return True
    
    # Helper function to perform stamping
    def do_stamp(pos):
        for i in range(M):
            target[pos + i] = '?'
            
    # Main loop to attempt to stamp all positions
    while count < N:
        stamped = False
        for i in range(N - M + 1):  # Try every possible position to stamp
            if not visited[i] and can_stamp(i):
                do_stamp(i)
                result.append(i)
                count += M
                visited[i] = True
                stamped = True

        if not stamped:  # If no stamping was possible in the current loop, break
            return []

    result.reverse()  # Reverse the order to match the description of steps
    return result
```

### Time Complexity
- **Best Case**: \( O(N \times M) \) where \( N \) is the length of the target and \( M \) is the length of the stamp.
- The algorithm repeatedly attempts to replace substrings, requiring \( O((N - M + 1) \times M) \).

This should solve the problem efficiently, keeping the steps minimal, and ensuring the requirements are met.
