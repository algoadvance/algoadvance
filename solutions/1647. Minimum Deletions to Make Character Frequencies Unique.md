title:  Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Unique-out
permalink: /s1647
---

Given a string `s`, your task is to return the minimum number of deletions required to make the frequency of each character unique. In other words, there should be no two different characters in `s` that have the same frequency.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "aab"
Output: 0
Explanation: "a" occurs twice and "b" occurs once. Both frequencies are unique.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "aaabbbcc"
Output: 2
Explanation: You can delete two 'b's resulting in "aaabcc". Then, the frequency of the characters are "a" --> 3, "b" --> 1, "c" --> 2.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "ceabaacb"
Output: 2
Explanation: You can delete both 'c's resulting in "eabaab". Then the frequencies of the characters are "e"-->1, "a"-->4, "b"-->2.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input string be empty?**
   - No, the problem constraints ensure that the string has at least one character.

2. **Are there any constraints on the length of the string or character set?**
   - The string `s` will contain only lowercase English characters and its length will be in the range `[1, 10^5]`.

### Strategy

1. **Count Character Frequencies:** Use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each character in the string.
2. **Track Frequencies and Ensure Uniqueness:**
   - Use another set or dictionary to track the frequencies that are already taken.
   - Iterate over the character frequencies. For each frequency, if itâ€™s already taken, reduce the frequency (which mimics deleting a character) until you find a frequency that is not already taken.
3. **Calculate Minimum Deletions:**
   - Keep a counter for deletions needed to convert the frequency to a number that is not already taken.

### Code

```python
def minDeletions(s: str) -> int:
    from collections import Counter
    
    # Count the frequencies of each character in s
    freq_count = Counter(s)
    
    # Set to store frequencies that we have encountered
    used_frequencies = set()
    
    deletions = 0
    
    # Iterate over all frequencies
    for char, freq in freq_count.items():
        # While the frequency is not unique
        while freq > 0 and freq in used_frequencies:
            freq -= 1  # Decrease the frequency (mimic deletion)
            deletions += 1  # Increase the deletion count
        # Add the unique frequency to the set
        if freq > 0:
            used_frequencies.add(freq)
    
    return deletions
```

### Time Complexity

- **Counting Frequencies**: O(N) where N is the length of the string `s`.
- **Iterating through Frequencies**: O(K) where K is the number of unique characters (K <= 26 for lowercase English letters).
- **Reducing Frequency in Uniqueness Check**: In the worst case, this may sum to O(N), but in practice, it will be much smaller because it converges quickly.

Hence, the overall time complexity is O(N), making the solution efficient for large strings of up to 100,000 characters.
