title:  Count Subtrees With Max Distance Between Cities-out
permalink: /s1617
---

You are given an integer `n`. There are `n` cities labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` represents a bidirectional edge between city `ui` and city `vi`.

Return an array `ans` of size `n - 1` where `ans[i]` is the number of subtrees in which the maximum distance between any two nodes is equal to `i + 1`.

A subtree is at least a node (consisting of the node itself) and all nodes that are directly or indirectly connected to it.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - `2 <= n <= 15`
   - `edges.length == n - 1`
   - `edges[i].length == 2`
   - `1 <= ui, vi <= n`
   - All pairs `(ui, vi)` are unique

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Return an array of size `n - 1`.

### Strategy

Given the input constraints, we can use the following approach:

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - We start by representing the input cities and edges as a graph using an adjacency list.

2. **Enumerate Subtrees:**
   - We generate all possible subsets (or subtrees) of the cities.
   - For each subset, we check if it forms a connected component (a valid subtree).

3. **Calculate Maximum Distance:**
   - For each valid subtree, calculate the maximum distance between any two nodes within the subtree.
   - This can be done using BFS/DFS from every node in the subset.

4. **Count for each Distance:**
   - Maintain a count of maximum distances for each valid subtree using an array.

5. **Result Array:**
   - Populate the result array where the index represents the maximum distance (length - 1).

### Time Complexity
- Since `n` is up to 15, we can afford to generate all subsets which is `O(2^n)`.
- Checking each subset for connectivity takes `O(n^2)` due to BFS/DFS.

### Implementation

Here is the code implementation:

```python
from itertools import combinations

def countSubgraphsForEachDiameter(n, edges):
    from collections import defaultdict, deque

    def bfs(node, nodes):
        dist = [-1] * (n + 1)
        dist[node] = 0
        queue = deque([node])
        while queue:
            u = queue.popleft()
            for v in graph[u]:
                if v in nodes and dist[v] == -1:
                    dist[v] = dist[u] + 1
                    queue.append(v)
        return dist

    def max_distance(nodes):
        max_dist = 0
        for node in nodes:
            dist = bfs(node, nodes)
            for d in dist:
                if d != -1:
                    max_dist = max(max_dist, d)
        return max_dist
    
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)

    count = [0] * (n - 1)
    for size in range(2, n + 1):
        for nodes in combinations(range(1, n + 1), size):
            nodes = set(nodes)
            # Check if it's a valid subtree
            visited = set()
            stack = [next(iter(nodes))]
            while stack:
                node = stack.pop()
                if node not in visited:
                    visited.add(node)
                    for neighbor in graph[node]:
                        if neighbor in nodes and neighbor not in visited:
                            stack.append(neighbor)
            if len(visited) == len(nodes):
                # Calculate the maximum distance in this subtree
                dist = max_distance(nodes)
                if dist > 0:
                    count[dist - 1] += 1
                
    return count

# Example usage
n = 4
edges = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [2, 4]]
print(countSubgraphsForEachDiameter(n, edges))  # Example output: [3, 4, 0]

```

### Explanation

1. **Graph Construction:**
   - Graph is constructed using adjacency list.

2. **Generating Subtrees:**
   - We use `itertools.combinations` to generate all subsets of nodes.

3. **Checking Connectivity:**
   - For each subset, we use DFS to verify if it's fully connected.

4. **Calculating Maximum Distance:**
   - BFS is used to calculate distances from each node within the subset to find the maximum distance.

5. **Populating Result:**
   - We update the count array based on the maximum distances found for valid subtrees.
