title:  Sort the Jumbled Numbers-out
permalink: /s2191
---
You are given a list of integers `nums` with digits jumbled using a custom mapping `mapping` where `mapping[i]` is the new digit of `i` (0-indexed). Your task is to sort `nums` according to their real values obtained by replacing each digit according to the `mapping`.

For example, if mapping = `[2, 1, 4, 8, 6, 3, 0, 9, 7, 5]` then the real representation of `990` will be `554`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can `nums` contain negative numbers?
   - No, we are assuming `nums` only contain non-negative integers.
2. How large can `nums` be?
   - Let's assume `nums` can contain up to 1000 elements.
3. How large can the integers in `nums` be?
   - Let's assume integers can be up to the maximum integer size in most programming languages (e.g., `2^31 - 1` for a signed 32-bit integer).
4. Is `mapping` always a permutation of digits [0-9]?
   - Yes, `mapping` is always a unique permutation of the digits [0-9].

### Strategy
1. **Mapping Transformation**: Create a helper function `transform` that converts a number according to the given `mapping`.
2. **Custom Sort**: Use Python's sorting capabilities with a key function that sorts `nums` based on their transformed values.

### Code
```python
from typing import List

def sortJumbled(mapping: List[int], nums: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    def transform(num: int) -> int:
        # Transform the number according to the mapping
        transformed = int(''.join(str(mapping[int(digit)]) for digit in str(num)))
        return transformed
    
    # Sort nums with the transformed values as keys
    nums_sorted = sorted(nums, key=transform)
    return nums_sorted

# Example Usage
mapping = [2, 1, 4, 8, 6, 3, 0, 9, 7, 5]
nums = [990, 332, 981]
sorted_nums = sortJumbled(mapping, nums)
print(sorted_nums)  # Output should be sorted according to transformed values
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Transformation**: Converting a number to its transformed version involves iterating over its digits, which is O(D) where D is the number of digits.
2. **Sorting**: Sorting `nums` involves a sorting step which is O(N log N) where N is the number of elements.
3. **Overall**: For each element, we call the transformation (O(D)). Sorting then happens using these keys, so the overall complexity is O(N D log N).

### Summary
- The implementation defines a helper function to transform each number.
- It then sorts the numbers using this transformation as the key.
- The computational efficiency of our method depends on the number of digits but is largely dominated by the sorting step.
