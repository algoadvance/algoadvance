title:  Check If a String Can Break Another String-out
permalink: /s1433
---
Given two strings: `s1` and `s2`, each of which contains only lowercase letters. Check if some permutation of string `s1` can break some permutation of string `s2` or vice-versa (in other words, if there exists a permutation of one string that is lexicographically greater than or equal to a permutation of the other string).

Specifically, a string `x` can break string `y` (both of the same length) if `x[i] >= y[i]` for all `i` in the range `[0, ..., n-1]`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are the strings guaranteed to be of the same length? 
   - Yes, they are specified to be of the same length.

2. Can the strings be empty?
   - No, the problem implies non-empty strings as the context involves comparison based on character positions.

3. What character set is involved?
   - The strings consist only of lowercase letters.

## Strategy
1. **Sort both strings**: By sorting both strings, we can directly compare them character by character. If one sorted string can break the other, it implies the condition holds for some permutation of the string.

2. **Comparison**: Compare the sorted versions of the strings character by character in both directions (i.e., check if `sorted(s1)` can break `sorted(s2)` and vice-versa).

3. **Conclusion**: If either sorted `s1` can break sorted `s2` or sorted `s2` can break sorted `s1`, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.

## Code
Here is the Python implementation of the above strategy:

```python
def checkIfCanBreak(s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
    # Sort both strings
    sorted_s1 = sorted(s1)
    sorted_s2 = sorted(s2)
    
    # Check if sorted_s1 can break sorted_s2
    can_s1_break_s2 = True
    can_s2_break_s1 = True
    
    for i in range(len(s1)):
        if sorted_s1[i] < sorted_s2[i]:
            can_s1_break_s2 = False
        if sorted_s2[i] < sorted_s1[i]:
            can_s2_break_s1 = False
    
    return can_s1_break_s2 or can_s2_break_s1

# Example Usage
s1 = "abc"
s2 = "xya"
print(checkIfCanBreak(s1, s2))  # Output: True
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: Sorting each of the strings takes \(O(n \log n)\), where `n` is the length of the string.
- **Comparison**: Comparing the sorted strings character by character takes \(O(n)\).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\) for the sorting step, which dominates the complexity.

## Conclusion
This approach ensures that the permutation check is efficiently conducted using sorting and linear comparison, adhering to the problem constraints and providing an optimal solution.
