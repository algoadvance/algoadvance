title:  Construct String with Minimum Cost-out
permalink: /s3213
---

Given a string `s` consisting of lowercase alphabets and an integer `k`, you need to perform the following operations exactly once:

1. Select any non-empty substring of `s` and reverse it.
2. Replace any character of `s` with any lowercase alphabet `k` times in total.

Your task is to find the lexicographically smallest string possible after performing the above operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length range of the string `s`?**
   - This affects the complexity and choice of algorithms.

2. **Can `k` be zero?**
   - Confirming this helps understand edge cases.

3. **Can replacements affect already replaced characters, or are they independent?**
   - Understanding this affects optimal strategy for replacements.

### Strategy

1. **Understanding Reversal:**
   - Reversing a substring might help to reorder characters in a way to produce a lexicographically smaller string.

2. **Replacements:**
   - Using `k` replacements optimally would involve changing higher valued alphabets (like `z`) to lower valued ones (like `a`) in steps.

3. **Greedy Approach:**
   - A greedy approach might involve always working to make the smallest possible lexicographical change at each step.

### Step-by-Step Strategy

1. Begin by examining the structure of the initial string.
2. Reverse substrings where it yields the most significant improvements.
3. Calculate cost optimally for replacements to achieve the minimum lexicographical string.

Here is the Python code implementing this strategy:

### Code

```python
def minimizeString(s: str, k: int) -> str:
    # Step 1: Try to reverse the string for the best lexicographical result
    res = s
    for i in range(len(s)):
        for j in range(i, len(s)):
            # Reversing the substring s[i:j+1]
            reversed_str = s[:i] + s[i:j+1][::-1] + s[j+1:]
            if reversed_str < res:
                res = reversed_str
    
    # Step 2: Apply `k` replacements to make it lexicographically smallest
    res = list(res)
    for i in range(len(res)):
        if k <= 0:
            break
        # If the current character is not 'a', try to replace it
        if res[i] != 'a':
            if k >= ord(res[i]) - ord('a'):
                k -= ord(res[i]) - ord('a')
                res[i] = 'a'
            else:
                res[i] = chr(ord(res[i]) - k)
                k = 0
    
    return "".join(res)

# Example Usage
s = "abdc"
k = 1
print(minimizeString(s, k))  # Expected output: "aadc" or some lexicographical permutations
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Reversal Step:**
   - This involves a nested loop over the length of the string: \(O(n^3)\)

2. **Replacement Step:**
   - The replacement operation runs in \(O(n)\)

The overall complexity becomes \(O(n^3)\), which may be influenced by the constraints on the length of the string `s`.

### Conclusion

This solution aims to find the lexicographically smallest string with the given operations. The greedy choice for reversal and replacement ensures minimizing the lexicographical order step by step. Further optimization might be required depending on additional constraints or efficiency needs.
