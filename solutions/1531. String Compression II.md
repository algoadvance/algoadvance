**LeetCode 1531** - **String Compression II**

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, you need to delete `k` characters from `s`, such that the resultant string is compressed to the smallest possible length. The length of the compressed string is determined using the following rule:

- If a segment of `s` contains `m` repeating characters, it is compressed to `"char"` + `"m"`. For example, the string `"aaabcccd"` would be compressed to `"a3b1c3d1"`.

Return the length of the shortest possible string after removing `k` characters from `s` and compressing.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Does the string contain only lowercase English letters?**
   - Yes, the string `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
2. **Can `k` be greater than the length of `s`?**
   - No, `k` will be such that `0 <= k <= len(s)`.
3. **What should be returned if `k` is 0?**
   - If `k` is 0, return the length of the compressed form of `s`.

## Strategy
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming with memoization. We will define `dp(i, k)` as the smallest length of the compressed string that can be obtained by considering the substring starting at index `i` and performing at most `k` deletions.

To implement this:
1. Define a memoization table `dp`.
2. Iterate through all possible substrings of `s`.
3. Calculate the compressed length for each possible splitting point.
4. Return the minimum length obtained.

## Code

```python
def getLengthOfOptimalCompression(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    from functools import lru_cache
    
    @lru_cache(None)
    def dp(i, k):
        # If no deletions remain
        if k == 0:
            return compress_length(s[i:])
        # If we reach the end of the string
        if i == len(s):
            return 0
        
        # Start with deleting the current character
        res = dp(i+1, k-1)
        
        # Try to form a block of identical characters
        length, same = 0, 0
        for j in range(i, len(s)):
            if s[j] == s[i]:
                same += 1
            else:
                length += 1
            
            if k < length:
                break
            res = min(res, compress_length_count(same) + dp(j+1, k-length))
        
        return res
    
    def compress_length(substring):
        if not substring:
            return 0
        result_len, count = 0, 0
        prev_char = ""
        
        for i, char in enumerate(substring):
            if char == prev_char:
                count += 1
            else:
                if prev_char:
                    result_len += 1 + (len(str(count)) if count > 1 else 0)
                prev_char, count = char, 1
        
        if prev_char:
            result_len += 1 + (len(str(count)) if count > 1 else 0)
        
        return result_len

    def compress_length_count(count):
        if count == 0:
            return 0
        return 1 + (len(str(count)) if count > 1 else 0)

    return dp(0, k)

# Example usage
s = "aaabcccd"
k = 2
print(getLengthOfOptimalCompression(s, k))  # Output: 4
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is `O(n^2 * k)` where `n` is the length of the string, because we iterate over all substrings and use memoization to store results.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is `O(n * k)` for the memoization table.

This approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the minimal compressed length by trying out different ways of removing `k` characters.
