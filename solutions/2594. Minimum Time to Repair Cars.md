title:  Minimum Time to Repair Cars-out
permalink: /s2594
---

You are given an array `ranks` consisting of positive integers where `ranks[i]` represents the rank of the i-th mechanic. Each mechanic can repair a car, but the time taken by a mechanic to repair a car is proportional to the square of their rank. More precisely, if a mechanic has a rank `r`, then the k-th car that the mechanic repairs takes `k * k * r` units of time. You are also given an integer `cars`, which represents the total number of cars that need to be repaired.

You need to determine the minimum time needed to repair all the cars by optimally distributing them among the mechanics.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the number of cars be greater than the number of mechanics?
   - Yes, the number of cars can be greater than the number of mechanics, and mechanics can repair more than one car.
   
2. Is the repair time integer-based or can it be fractional?
   - The repair time as given in the problem is specified in units, which implies it is integer-based.

3. Are there constraints on the input sizes?
   - Let's assume typical constraints as in other competitive programming problems, likely up to 10^4 for the number of mechanics or cars.

### Strategy

1. **Binary Search on Time**:
   - The core idea is to use binary search to determine the minimum possible time required to repair all cars.
   - This involves defining a function `canRepairInTime(time)` that determines if it's possible to repair all the cars within `time` given the mechanics' ranks.

2. **Implementation Steps**:
   - **Binary Search**: Start with low = 1 and high = the highest possible time.
   - **Feasibility Check**: For a mid-value of time, calculate the maximum number of cars each mechanic can repair within this time, and check if the total number is at least equal to `cars`.
   - Adjust the search range based on whether the current mid-value time is feasible or not.

### Code

```python
def canRepairInTime(ranks, cars, time):
    total_cars = 0
    for rank in ranks:
        total_cars += int((time // rank) ** 0.5)
        if total_cars >= cars:
            return True
    return False

def minTimeToRepairCars(ranks, cars):
    left, right = 1, max(ranks) * cars * cars
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if canRepairInTime(ranks, cars, mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    return left

# Example usage:
ranks = [4, 2, 3]
cars = 7
print(minTimeToRepairCars(ranks, cars))  # Expected output can be calculated based on specific example
```

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search**: The time complexity of the binary search is `O(log(T))`, where `T` is the maximum possible time.
- **Feasibility Check**: For each mid-value calculation, checking feasibility requires iterating through all mechanics, leading to `O(N)` operations per feasibility check.

Combining both, the total time complexity is `O(N log(T))`, where `N` is the number of mechanics and `T` is the maximum possible time. Given typical constraints, this approach should be efficient.
