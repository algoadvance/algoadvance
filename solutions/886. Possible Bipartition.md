title:  Possible Bipartition-out
permalink: /s886
---
Given a set of `n` people (numbered from `1` to `n`), we would like to split everyone into two groups of any size. Each person may dislike some other people, and they should not go into the same group.

We are given a 2D array `dislikes` where each `dislikes[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that person `a_i` dislikes person `b_i`. Return `true` if and only if it is possible to split everyone into two groups in this way.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - Typically, constraints will be given in the problem statement. Let's assume a reasonable range like `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`.

2. **Can there be duplicate dislike pairs in `dislikes` array?**
   - Typically, no duplicate pairs are expected, but this can be clarified or handled in code.

3. **Is it guaranteed that the `dislikes` array will not contain self-loops? (i.e., person dislikes themselves)**
   - Usually, this can be assumed but can be gone through preprocessing to ensure the data integrity.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can model it as a graph problem:
- Each person is a node.
- Each dislike relationship is an edge between two nodes.
- We need to check if the graph is bipartite, which means we can color the graph using two colors such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color.

#### General Steps:
1. **Graph Representation:** Use an adjacency list to store the graph.
2. **Bipartiteness Check:** Use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to try to color the graph.
   - If at any point, we find a conflict (i.e., two adjacent nodes have the same color), the graph is not bipartite, and we return `false`.
   - Otherwise, after all nodes are processed, we return `true`.

### Code
```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def possibleBipartition(n, dislikes):
    # Step 1: Create an adjacency list for the graph
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in dislikes:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)

    # Step 2: Initialize a color array for nodes (0: uncolored, 1: color1, -1: color2)
    color = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Step 3: BFS/DFS to check for bipartiteness
    def bfs(start):
        queue = deque([start])
        color[start] = 1  # Start coloring with color 1
        
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if color[neighbor] == 0:  # If the neighbor hasn't been colored yet
                    color[neighbor] = -color[node]  # Color with the opposite color
                    queue.append(neighbor)
                elif color[neighbor] == color[node]:  # If the neighbor has the same color
                    return False
        return True

    # Step 4: Check each component of the graph
    for person in range(1, n + 1):
        if color[person] == 0:  # Not yet colored, thus needs to be checked
            if not bfs(person):
                return False
                
    return True
```

### Time Complexity
- **Building the graph:** O(E) where E is the length of the `dislikes` array.
- **BFS traversal:** O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices (people `1` to `n`) and E is the number of edges (`dislikes`).

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(V + E), which is efficient for the given constraints.
