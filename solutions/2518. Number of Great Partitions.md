Leetcode Problem 2518: Number of Great Partitions (Hard)

You are given an array `nums` (composed of `n` integers) and an integer `k`. We define a partition as "great" if it is possible to partition the array into two non-empty subsets `A` and `B` such that the sum of the elements in `A` and the sum of the elements in `B` are both greater than or equal to `k`.

Return the number of distinct great partitions the array can be divided into. Two partitions are considered distinct if there exists an element in `nums` that is in one partition in one way but in another partition in another way.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the expected range of `nums` and `k`?**
   - This could affect whether a brute force approach is feasible.

2. **Can elements in `nums` be negative?**
   - This would affect how we calculate and compare sums.

3. **Is there a constraint on the length of `nums`?**
   - This aids in designing an efficient solution.

4. **What should be returned if no partitions are great?**
   - Should the function return 0, or is there an exception to be thrown?

## Code

Now that we understand the problem, we can lay out a strategy to solve it.

## Strategy

1. **Calculate the Total Sum**:
   - If the combined sum of all elements in `nums` is less than `2*k`, it's impossible to have any partition where both subsets have sums â‰¥ `k`.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Use a dynamic programming (DP) array to keep track of possible sums.
   - Iterate through the `nums` array and update the DP array to reflect the new possible sums created by adding each element.
   
3. **Count Configurations**:
   - Use the DP array to count the number of ways we can form sums that are both >= `k`.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \cdot S)\), where \(S\) is the total sum of elements in `nums`. This is mainly due to the DP array updates for each element.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(S)\) to maintain the DP array.

```python
def countGreatPartitions(nums, k):
    total_sum = sum(nums)
    
    if total_sum < 2 * k:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize a DP array
    dp = [0] * (total_sum + 1)
    dp[0] = 1  # There's one way to get a sum of 0: by choosing no elements

    # Update DP array
    for num in nums:
        for t in range(total_sum, num - 1, -1):
            dp[t] += dp[t - num]

    count = 0
    for s in range(k, total_sum - k + 1):
        count += dp[s]
    
    total_partitions = 2 ** (len(nums) - 1)
    
    return total_partitions - count

# Example usage:
nums = [3, 3, 3]
k = 6
print(countGreatPartitions(nums, k)) # Output depends on the specific example
```

This solution initiates by calculating the `total_sum` and checking if it is feasible to have two partitions satisfying the condition. We use dynamic programming to track the possible sums up to the `total_sum`. Finally, we count how many sums meet the criteria and adjust to find the number of great partitions according to the constraints given.
