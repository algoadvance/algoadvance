title:  Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination-out
permalink: /s1293
---

You are given an `m x n` grid, where each cell is either a `0` (empty) or a `1` (obstacle). You can move up, down, left, or right from and to an empty cell. The goal is to find the shortest path from the top-left corner (0, 0) to the bottom-right corner (m-1, n-1). 

You are also given an integer `k`, the maximum number of obstacles you can eliminate. Return the length of the shortest path such that you can reach the destination after removing at most `k` obstacles. If there is no such path, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Grid Boundary**: What are the constraints on the dimensions of the grid?
   - The grid dimensions can be up to 40x40.

2. **Obstacle Constraints**: What is the range of obstacle values in the grid and values of `k`?
   - The grid is binary; cells are either `0` or `1`, and `k` is a non-negative integer less than 200.

3. **Movement Constraints**: Can you move diagonally, or only up/down/left/right?
   - Movements are restricted to up, down, left, and right.

4. **Starting and Ending Points**: Confirming that the starting point is always at (0,0) and the destination is at (m-1, n-1)?
   - Yes, starting at (0,0) and ending at (m-1,n-1).

### Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: This problem can effectively be solved using a BFS approach because we are looking for the shortest path in an unweighted grid.
2. **State Representation**: Each state in the BFS will be represented by a tuple `(x, y, remaining_k)` where `(x, y)` represents the current cell and `remaining_k` represents the number of obstacles we can still eliminate.
3. **Visited State Tracking**: Use a 3-dimensional array or a set to track the visited states with coordinates and the number of obstacles left to eliminate to avoid revisiting the same state with the same or more remaining eliminations.

### Algorithm

1. Initialize a queue for BFS and a visited set to track states.
2. Enqueue the initial state `(0, 0, k)` with path length `0`.
3. For each state, explore the four possible directions (up, down, left, right).
4. For each direction, check if it’s within bounds and whether it’s an obstacle.
5. If it’s an obstacle and we have remaining eliminations (`remaining_k > 0`), add the new state to the queue.
6. If it’s an empty cell, move to the next cell and add the new state to the queue.
7. Continue this process until the destination is reached or the queue is empty.

### Code

```python
from collections import deque

def shortestPath(grid, k):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    if m == 1 and n == 1:
        return 0 if grid[0][0] == 0 else -1
        
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    queue = deque([(0, 0, k)])  # (x, y, remaining k)
    visited = set((0, 0, k))
    steps = 0

    while queue:
        for _ in range(len(queue)):
            x, y, remaining_k = queue.popleft()
            if (x, y) == (m-1, n-1):
                return steps
            
            for dx, dy in directions:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                
                if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n:
                    next_k = remaining_k - grid[nx][ny]
                    if next_k >= 0 and (nx, ny, next_k) not in visited:
                        visited.add((nx, ny, next_k))
                        queue.append((nx, ny, next_k))
        
        steps += 1

    return -1
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution can be analyzed as follows:
- **BFS Processing**: In the worst case, we might traverse all cells multiple times; each cell can potentially be visited with various values of `k`.
- **State Space**: There are at most `m*n` cells and each cell can have up to `k + 1` states (different counts of remaining eliminations).

Thus, the worst-case time complexity is `O(m * n * k)`.

This approach ensures that we are exploring the shortest path efficiently while keeping track of the numbers of obstacles we can still eliminate.
