title:  Longest Palindrome-out

Given a string `s` which consists of lowercase or uppercase letters, find the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with those letters.

Letters are case-sensitive, for example, "Aa" is not considered a palindrome.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Palindrome Definition**: A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward, e.g., "racecar".
2. **Input Constraints**: 
    - The input string will have a length between 1 and 2000.
    - The string consists only of uppercase and lowercase English letters.
3. Do we need to return the longest palindromic substring or its length?
    - We need to return the length of the longest palindromes that can be built with the given characters.

### Strategy

1. **Character Frequency Counting**:
    - Use a dictionary or a `collections.Counter` to count the frequency of each character in the string.

2. **Pair Counting**:
    - Initialize a variable to keep track of the length of the longest palindrome.
    - Iterate through the frequency counts and add the largest even number less than or equal to that count (this is because pairs of characters can contribute to a palindrome).

3. **Odd Frequency Handling**:
    - If there is at least one character with an odd frequency count, we can include one of those characters in the middle of the palindrome to maximize its length.

### Code

```python
from collections import Counter

def longestPalindrome(s: str) -> int:
    freq = Counter(s)
    length = 0
    odd_found = False
    
    for count in freq.values():
        if count % 2 == 0:
            length += count
        else:
            length += count - 1
            odd_found = True
    
    if odd_found:
        length += 1
    
    return length

# Example usage
s = "abccccdd"
print(longestPalindrome(s))  # Expected output: 7
```

### Explanation:

1. **Count Frequencies**:
    - Use `Counter(s)` to get the frequency of each character.

2. **Sum Even Counts**:
    - If a count is even, add it directly to `length` since all of these characters can be paired up perfectly.

3. **Handle Odd Counts**:
    - If a count is odd, add the largest even part (i.e., `count - 1`) to `length` to maximize the number of pairs.
    - Keep track of any odd count using the `odd_found` flag.

4. **Include One Odd**:
    - If there was any odd count, add 1 to `length` to account for one character that can sit in the middle of the palindrome.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we iterate through the string to count character frequencies and then through the frequency dictionary.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since the number of distinct characters (uppercase or lowercase) is limited to 52, irrespective of the input size.
