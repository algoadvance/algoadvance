title:  Double a Number Represented as a Linked List-out
permalink: /s2816
---

You are given a non-negative number represented as a singly linked list of digits. The most significant digit comes first and each of their nodes contains a single digit. You need to double the number and return it as a linked list.

Example:
```
Input: head = [1,2,3]
Output: [2,4,6]
```

Note:
- Each digit's node's value is between 0 and 9.
- The number does not contain any leading zeros except for the zero itself.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the size of the linked list?**
   - The problem does not specify, but we can assume it fits in memory given it's a typical coding interview problem.
  
2. **What should be done if the doubled number creates a carry that increases the digit count?**
   - For example, doubling `999` results in `1998`, so we need to handle the case of carries.

3. **Will the input be a proper singly linked list?**
   - Yes, we assume the linked list is valid and each node contains a single digit.

### Strategy

1. **Reverse the List:** 
   - First, we need to reverse the linked list to make it easier to perform operations starting from the least significant digit.

2. **Double the Digits:** 
   - Iterate through the reversed list to double each digit and handle the carry.

3. **Reverse the Resultant List:**
   - Once we have the doubled digits, we need to reverse the list back to the correct order.

### Time Complexity
The approach we have selected involves three passes through the linked list: one for reversing the list, one for doubling the digits and managing carries, and one for reversing the list back to the original order. Hence, the time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the linked list.

### Code Implementation

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def reverseList(head):
    prev = None
    current = head
    while current:
        next_temp = current.next
        current.next = prev
        prev = current
        current = next_temp
    return prev

def doubleNumber(head):
    # Reverse the linked list
    head = reverseList(head)
    
    current = head
    carry = 0
    
    # Traverse the reversed list and double each value
    while current:
        doubled_value = current.val * 2 + carry
        current.val = doubled_value % 10  # Store the digit
        carry = doubled_value // 10       # Calculate the carry over
        if not current.next and carry:
            # If there is no next node but we have a carry
            current.next = ListNode(carry)
            carry = 0
        current = current.next
    
    # Reverse the list back to its original form
    head = reverseList(head)
    
    return head

# Helper function to convert a list of integers to a linked list
def list_to_linked_list(arr):
    if not arr:
        return None
    head = ListNode(arr[0])
    current = head
    for num in arr[1:]:
        current.next = ListNode(num)
        current = current.next
    return head

# Helper function to convert a linked list to a list
def linked_list_to_list(head):
    current = head
    result = []
    while current:
        result.append(current.val)
        current = current.next
    return result

# Example usage:
input_list = [1, 2, 3]
head = list_to_linked_list(input_list)
doubled_head = doubleNumber(head)
output_list = linked_list_to_list(doubled_head)
print(output_list)  # Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

### Explanation

1. **Reverse the List:**
   - The `reverseList()` function reverts the linked list so we can start processing digits from the least significant position.

2. **Double the Digits:**
   - We traverse the reversed list, double each digit, handle the carry, and store the result back in the linked list.

3. **Handle Carry:**
   - If there is any carry left after processing all the nodes, we add a new node for the carry.

4. **Reverse the List Again:**
   - Finally, we reverse the list back to its original order to get the correct result.
