title:  Find the Longest Equal Subarray-out
permalink: /s2831
---

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, find the longest subarray that contains only one unique element and can be formed by deleting at most `k` elements from the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Assumptions**: 
   - Are all the integers in the array `nums` non-negative?
   - Is the array `nums` guaranteed to have at least one element?
   - What are the upper and lower bounds of `k` and the length of `nums`?

2. **Output Criteria**:
   - Should the function return the length of the longest subarray only, or should it also return the subarray itself?
   - How should ties be handled if there are multiple subarrays with the same maximum length?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will use the sliding window technique combined with a frequency dictionary.

1. **Sliding Window Technique**: We will use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to create a window that can potentially be the subarray we are looking for.
  
2. **Frequency Dictionary**: A dictionary will help to keep track of the frequency of the elements within the current window.

3. **Deletion Counter**: We will maintain a variable to count how many deletions have occurred so far.

4. **Shrinking the Window**: If the number of deletions exceeds `k`, we will shift the `left` pointer to reduce the window size until the number of deletions is back to `k`.

5. **Tracking the Longest Subarray**: We will keep track of the longest subarray formed that meets the requirements.

### Code

Let's implement the stated strategy in Python:

```python
def longest_equal_subarray(nums, k):
    from collections import defaultdict

    # Dictionary to keep count of each element
    freq = defaultdict(int)
    
    left = 0
    max_length = 0
    
    for right in range(len(nums)):
        freq[nums[right]] += 1
        
        # Calculate current window size and the max frequency of an element in the current window
        current_window_size = right - left + 1
        max_freq = max(freq.values())
        
        # If the number of deletions needed is more than k, shrink the window from the left
        while current_window_size - max_freq > k:
            freq[nums[left]] -= 1
            if freq[nums[left]] == 0:
                del freq[nums[left]]
            left += 1
            current_window_size = right - left + 1
            max_freq = max(freq.values())
        
        # Update the max_length
        max_length = max(max_length, current_window_size)
    
    return max_length

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 3, 3, 9, 6, 3, 3, 3, 3]
k = 2
print(longest_equal_subarray(nums, k))  # Output should be the length of the longest subarray
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of `nums`. Here's the breakdown:

1. The `right` pointer traverses each element exactly once.
2. The `left` pointer may also traverse each element at most once (in total, not per iteration).
3. Operations within the loop (including checking and updating the frequency dictionary) are constant time operations, O(1).

Thus, the overall complexity is linear, O(n).

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is **O(m)** where `m` is the number of unique elements in the array `nums`. This is because we use a frequency dictionary that stores each unique element's frequency.
