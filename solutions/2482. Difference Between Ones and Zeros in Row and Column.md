title:  Difference Between Ones and Zeros in Row and Column-out
permalink: /s2482
---

You are given a 2D integer matrix `grid` consisting of 0's and 1's. 

- A *score* for an element in the grid is defined as the difference between the count of 1's in the same row and column and the count of 0's in the same row and column.
- Write a function `differenceGrid` that calculates this score for each element in the `grid` and returns a 2D integer matrix of the same size where each element is replaced by its score.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What are the dimensions of the matrix `grid`?
   - Are there any constraints on the size of the grid (e.g., maximum number of rows and columns)?
   - Are there any constraints on the values within the grid? Will it only contain 0's and 1's?

2. **Output Specifications**:
   - Should the result retain the same dimensions as the input grid?

### Strategy

1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - For each element `grid[i][j]`, we need to calculate the number of 1's minus the number of 0's in the same row `i` and column `j`.
   - The score is essentially a difference between counts of 1s and 0s in both the row and column.

2. **Steps to Solve**:
   - Calculate the count of 1's and 0's for each row.
   - Calculate the count of 1's and 0's for each column.
   - Use these precomputed counts to determine the score for each element in the grid.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Create two lists to store counts of 1's for each row and each column.
   - Traverse each element in the `grid` and update these lists.
   - Compute the score for each element based on the precomputed total rows' and columns' counts.
   - Construct the resulting grid with the calculated scores.
        
### Code

```python
def differenceGrid(grid):
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])

    # Initialize lists to store count of 1's in rows and columns
    row_ones_count = [0] * rows
    col_ones_count = [0] * cols

    # Initialize lists to store count of 0's in rows and columns
    row_zeros_count = [0] * rows
    col_zeros_count = [0] * cols

    # Fill row and column counts
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                row_ones_count[i] += 1
                col_ones_count[j] += 1
            else:
                row_zeros_count[i] += 1
                col_zeros_count[j] += 1

    # Create the result grid
    result = [[0]*cols for _ in range(rows)]

    # Calculate the score for each cell
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            ones_count = row_ones_count[i] + col_ones_count[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == 1 else 0)
            zeros_count = row_zeros_count[i] + col_zeros_count[j] - (1 if grid[i][j] == 0 else 0)
            result[i][j] = ones_count - zeros_count

    return result
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Preprocessing Counts**:
   - Counting 1's and 0's in each row and column requires iterating through every element in the grid once.
   - Time complexity is \( O(rows \times cols) \).

2. **Computing Scores**:
   - Again, we need to iterate through each element to calculate the score, which takes \( O(rows \times cols) \).

   Thus, the overall time complexity of this solution is \( O(rows \times cols) \).

With this strategy and code implementation, we can effectively solve the problem of calculating the difference between 1's and 0's in each element's corresponding row and column.
