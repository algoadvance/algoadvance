title:  Cracking the Safe-out

You have a device that creates a password through a series of presses on a circular dial. The device has `n` rotating dials, each with `k` possible digits (from `0` to `k-1`). The password is formed by pressing the dials to form a string of length `n`.

Imagine starting with a password of n zeros: `"000...0"`. At each step, you can change one digit to any of its possible values. 

Your goal is to find a string that contains every possible combination of possible `digits` for the `password` as a substring of length `n`.

Return the shortest string that would contain every combination of length `n` on the device's dials.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Clarification on Inputs and Outputs**:
    - Are `n` and `k` guaranteed to be positive integers?
    - What is the maximum value of `n` and `k` that the algorithm might handle?
    - Should `0` be included as a digit for `k`?

Given default constraints for complexity, we will assume manageable values for `n` and `k`.

### Strategy

The problem essentially involves finding a De Bruijn sequence of order `n` over `k` digits. A De Bruijn sequence for any `n` and `k` satisfies our requirement because any substring of length `n` appears exactly once.

To construct the De Bruijn sequence:

1. Use an `Eulerian cycle` approach in a `k-ary` de Bruijn sequence space.
2. Initiate with all the possible combinations of `n-1` length.
3. Ensure every node in the sequence visits all vertices exactly once using Hierholzerâ€™s algorithm to construct the cycle.

### Code

Here is the implementation in Python:

```python
def crackSafe(n: int, k: int) -> str:
    if n == 1 and k == 1:
        return "0"

    # Initialize the starting point and the visited set
    start_node = "0" * (n-1)
    visited = set()
    result = []

    def dfs(node: str):
        for digit in map(str, range(k)):
            new_node = node + digit
            if new_node not in visited:
                visited.add(new_node)
                dfs(new_node[1:])
                result.append(digit)

    # Begin DFS from the starting node
    dfs(start_node)
    result.extend(start_node)
    return ''.join(result)

# Example usage
n = 2
k = 2
print(crackSafe(n, k))
```

### Explanation of Code

1. **Initialization**: Start with a base node consisting of `n-1` zeros.
2. **DFS Traversal**: Perform Depth-First Search (DFS) where each state represents a possible combination of `n-1` digits. Add new nodes upon discovering.
3. **Marking Visited Nodes**: Ensure each combination is visited once (`visited` set).
4. **Backtrack Management**: Use backtracking to build the result such that each possible combination of length `n` appears once.
5. **Constructing Result**: Merge nodes and build the final sequence.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(k^n) because we will be visiting every possible combination of length `n` exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k^n) due to storing visited combinations and the resultant sequence.

This efficient approach ensures that we obtain the desired sequence satisfying the constraints using the properties of De Bruijn sequences.
