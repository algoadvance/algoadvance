title:  Minimum Skips to Arrive at Meeting On Time-out
permalink: /s1883
---

You are given an integer `hoursBefore`, and an array `dist` where dist[i] represents the distance between two consecutive cities. You need to go through all cities to reach a meeting, but you can decide to skip some cities and travel directly to the next one. You need to reach the meeting within exactly `hoursBefore` hours.

If the travel time on the road is `t` hours, when you leave at the start of an hour at 0 minutes past the hour, you need exactly `t` hours on the road plus one extra hour to spend at the starting location. 

You can lose up to `skipMinutes` per hour because of delays caused by traffic, but you can skip the extra time per skip by incurring `skipMinutes` in lost time. Calculate the minimum number of skips required to arrive at the meeting on time. Return -1 if it's not possible to reach within `hoursBefore` hours.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the distance array representing whole numbers?**
   - Yes, `dist` is given as an array of integers.

2. **Can skips be made only once, or multiple in sequence?**
   - Skips can be made multiple times independently at any city.

3. **Is there an upper limit to `dist` and `hoursBefore`?**
   - For typical problem constraints, you can assume the reasonable range for these values as within computational feasibility.

4. **How to interpret the time when skipping?**
   - When skipping, the travel time is rounded up to the nearest whole hour minus the traffic delay. 

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - We'll use a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum time needed to reach the i-th city with j skips.
   - Initialization: `dp[0][0] = 0`, since no time is used before starting.
   - Transition: To go from city `i` to city `i+1` with `j` skips, there are decisions to add time for travelling:
     ```python
     new_time = dp[i][j] + dist[i]
     ```
     - If not skipping:
       ```python
       dp[i+1][j] = ceil(new_time / speed) * speed
       ```
     - If skipping:
       ```python
       dp[i+1][j+1] = new_time (without considering extra breakpoint time)
       ```
2. **Check all possible skips:**
   - We need to find the minimum number of skips required such that the travel is less than or equal to `hoursBefore`.

3. **Final Verification:**
   - After building the `dp` table, check the configurations` dp` for feasibility.

### Code

Here is a Python solution implementing the above strategy:

```python
def minSkips(dist: List[int], hoursBefore: int) -> int:
    from math import ceil
    
    n = len(dist)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0  # Starting point, no skips, no time
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1):  # At most i skips can be used until city i
            # Without skipping
            dp[i + 1][j] = min(dp[i + 1][j], ceil(dp[i][j] / 60) * 60 + dist[i])
            # With skipping
            dp[i + 1][j + 1] = min(dp[i + 1][j + 1], dp[i][j] + dist[i])
    
    for j in range(n + 1):
        if dp[n][j] <= hoursBefore * 60:
            return j
    
    return -1
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is `O(n^2)`, where `n` is the number of distances i.e., the length of `dist`.
- The space complexity is also `O(n^2)` due to the DP table of size `(n+1) x (n+1)`.
