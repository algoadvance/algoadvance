title:  Minimum Number of People to Teach-out
permalink: /s1733

You are given integers `n` and `m`, and an array `languages` where `languages[i]` is a list of languages known by the i-th person. You are also given a list `friendships` where `friendships[j] = [u, v]` indicates that the `u-th` person and the `v-th` person are friends.

You need to teach one language to some people in such a way that every friend pair can communicate. Return the minimum number of people you need to teach.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: n = 2, languages = [[1], [2], [1,2]], friendships = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: You can teach any common language to person 1 or 2. The minimum number is 1.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are persons indexed starting from 1 or 0?**
   - They are indexed starting from 1.
2. **Do we count teaching the same person multiple languages separately?**
   - Yes, each teaching instance is counted separately.
3. **Can a person already know the language they need to be taught?**
   - No, we only count teaching a language that they don’t already know.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Non-communicative Friend Pairs**:
   - First, identify all friend pairs who do not have any common language.

2. **Frequency Count of Non-communicative Pairs per Language**:
   - For each language, determine how many people need to learn it so that all non-communicative pairs can communicate using that language.

3. **Minimize the Number of Teachings**:
   - Calculate the minimum number of teachings required across all languages.

### Code

Here’s how we can implement the strategy in Python:

```python
def minimumTeachings(n, languages, friendships):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    person_to_languages = {i + 1: set(languages[i]) for i in range(len(languages))}
    
    non_communicative_pairs = [(u, v) for u, v in friendships if person_to_languages[u].isdisjoint(person_to_languages[v])]
    
    if not non_communicative_pairs:
        return 0
    
    teach_count = defaultdict(int)
    
    for u, v in non_communicative_pairs:
        for language in person_to_languages[u].union(person_to_languages[v]):
            teach_count[language] += (language not in person_to_languages[u]) + (language not in person_to_languages[v])
    
    return min(teach_count.values())

# Example usage:
n = 2
languages = [[1], [2], [1,2]]
friendships = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
print(minimumTeachings(n, languages, friendships)) # Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity
- **O(F \* L):** where \( F \) is the number of friendships and \( L \) is the average number of languages per person.
- **O(N):** for traversing through the non-communicative pairs and counting the required teachings, where \( N \) is the number of different languages known in the system.

The overall complexity approximates to \( O(F \* L + N) \), which is feasible given that both \( F \) and \( L \) should be relatively manageable in size.
