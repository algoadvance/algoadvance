title:  Find Servers That Handled Most Number of Requests-out
permalink: /s1606
---

You have `k` servers numbered from `0` to `k-1` that are being used to handle multiple requests arriving in sequence. Each request `i` arrives at time `arrival[i]` and will take `load[i]` time to process. But if all servers are busy at the time the request arrives, it will be dropped (i.e., not handled at all).

Your task is to find the servers that handled the most number of requests. Return a list containing the indices of these servers. You may return the answer in **any order**.

**Example:**
```
Input: k = 3, arrival = [1,2,3,4,5], load = [5,2,3,3,3]
Output: [1]
Explanation: 
All of the servers start out free.
Request 1 arrives at server 1.
Request 2 arrives at server 2.
Request 3 arrives at server 0.
Request 4 arrives at server 1 (since server 1 was free).
Request 5 arrives at server 0 (since server 0 was free).
Server 1 handled the most number of requests, which is 2.
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= k <= 10^5`
- `1 <= arrival.length, load.length <= 10^5`
- `arrival.length == load.length`
- `1 <= arrival[i], load[i] <= 10^9`

## Clarifying Questions
1. What if there are multiple servers that handled the maximum number of requests? 
   - Return all such servers' indices in any order.
2. How should requests be assigned if multiple servers are free at the time of arrival?
   - They should be assigned to the server with the smallest index.

## Strategy
1. **Data Structures**:
    - Use a list to keep track of the end time of the current task for each server.
    - Use a list to count the number of requests each server has handled.
    - A priority queue (min-heap) to track the availability of servers by end time efficiently (servers become available after their current load is finished).

2. **Approach**:
    - Initialize a list to track the end time for each server.
    - Initialize a list to count requests for each server.
    - Use a min-heap to track currently available servers by their indices.
    - Iterate over each request:
      - Check if there are servers that have become free by the current request's arrival time and update the heap.
      - Assign the request to the next available server with the lowest index.
      - Maintain the count of requests handled by each server.
    - Find the maximum count(s) of requests handled and return the indices of those servers.

3. **Implementation**:

## Code
Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
import heapq

def busiestServers(k, arrival, load):
    # Track server end times (none initially busy)
    end_times = [0] * k
    
    # Track the count of requests handled by each server
    count_requests = [0] * k
    
    # Priority queue to track free servers. Initially, all are free.
    free_servers = list(range(k))
    heapq.heapify(free_servers)
    
    for i in range(len(arrival)):
        curr_time = arrival[i]
        duration = load[i]
        
        # Free up all servers that have finished their tasks by current time
        while free_servers and end_times[free_servers[0]] <= curr_time:
            heapq.heappop(free_servers)
        
        if free_servers:
            # Find the next available server
            server = heapq.heappop(free_servers)
            end_times[server] = curr_time + duration
            count_requests[server] += 1
            # The server will be free after `curr_time + duration`
            heapq.heappush(free_servers, (end_times[server], server))
    
    # Find the max number of requests handled
    max_requests = max(count_requests)
    
    # Collect all servers that have handled the max number of requests
    return [i for i, count in enumerate(count_requests) if count == max_requests]

# Example usage:
k = 3
arrival = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
load = [5, 2, 3, 3, 3]
print(busiestServers(k, arrival, load)) # Output: [1]
```

## Time Complexity
- Initializing and managing the priority queue (heap) has logarithmic complexity for each operation.
- The overall time complexity is `O(n log k)` where `n` is the number of requests and `k` is the number of servers. This is efficient given the problem constraints.
