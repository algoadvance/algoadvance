title:  Maximize Number of Subsequences in a String-out
permalink: /s2207
---

Given a string `text` and a string `pattern`, you have to insert the smallest number of characters into `text` to form the maximum number of subsequences of `pattern`. Return the maximum number of subsequences that can be formed. 

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1:**

- Input: `text = "abdcdbc", pattern = "abc"`
- Output: 4
- Explanation: We can insert "a" at index 0 and "b" at index 1 to make the "abc", resulting in a total of 4 subsequences ("abc").

**Example 2:**

- Input: `text = "aabb", pattern = "ab"`
- Output: 6
- Explanation: We can insert "ab" at positions between "aa" and "bb", combining them to form "aabb".

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the length range for `text` and `pattern`?
2. Are `text` and `pattern` guaranteed to be non-empty and contain only lowercase English letters?
3. Can we assume that `pattern` will always be a valid subsequence?

## Strategy

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to maximize the number of subsequences of `pattern` that can be formed by inserting the smallest number of characters into `text`.

2. **Identify Key Points:**
   - We need to take advantage of the existing characters in `text` to save on the number of insertions.
   - By inserting characters cleverly, we can maximize the number of subsequences.

3. **Approach:**
   - Count the occurrences of the characters of `pattern` in `text` and their positions.
   - Compute the potential subsequences by dynamic insertion of required characters.

4. **Steps to Solution:**
   1. Iterate through the characters of the `text`.
   2. Keep track of the occurrences of characters of `pattern`.
   3. Apply DP or a greedy approach to maximize the number of subsequences based on character positions.

## Code

Below is the Python solution for the problem:

```python
def maxSubsequences(text: str, pattern: str) -> int:
    p1, p2 = pattern[0], pattern[1]
    count_p1 = 0
    result = 0
    
    for char in text:
        if char == p2:
            result += count_p1
        if char == p1:
            count_p1 += 1
    
    # We have to consider additional places for new insertions
    total_p1 = text.count(p1)
    total_p2 = text.count(p2)
    
    # Case 1: Adding p1 at the start of text
    result = max(result, (total_p1 + 1) * total_p2)

    # Case 2: Adding p2 at the end of text
    result = max(result, total_p1 * (total_p2 + 1))
    
    return result

# Example Test Cases
print(maxSubsequences("abdcdbc", "abc"))  # Output: 4
print(maxSubsequences("aabb", "ab"))      # Output: 6
```

## Time Complexity

- **Counting and Looping:** The counting of characters and iterating through `text` are O(n) operations (where n is the length of `text`), making this solution efficient.
- **Insertions Consideration:** The pattern matching and insertion operations are also managed within O(n) complexity.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of this solution is optimal at **O(n)**.
