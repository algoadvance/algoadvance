title:  Find Xor-Beauty of Array-out
permalink: /s2527
---

We are given an array `nums` consisting of `n` non-negative integers. We need to compute a value called the XOR-Beauty of the array. The XOR-Beauty of the array is defined as the XOR of all subarrays' sums. A subarray is any contiguous sequence of elements within the array.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **What is the definition of the XOR operation?**
   The XOR operation is a binary operation that takes two bits and returns `1` if they are different and `0` if they are the same.

2. **Does the subarray need to be in sorted order?**
   No, a subarray is simply a contiguous portion of the array.

3. **What is meant by the sum of a subarray?**
   It is the addition of all elements within the subarray.

4. **Is there any constraint on the size of the array?**
   Typically, constraints would be provided, e.g., `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5` and `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`.

### Strategy:

1. **Extract an Intuitive Approach:**
   - To solve this problem, we need to understand how often each bit in a number influences the final result of XORing the sums of all subarrays.
   
2. **Simplify the Problem:**
   - Using properties of XOR and summation, it can be deduced that instead of individually taking all subarrays and computing their sums, we can leverage mathematical properties to simplify our task.
  
3. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - Each element in the array contributes to multiple subarrays. The critical insight here is that considering the contribution of each number in the context of its occurrence frequency may simplify the task.
   - For each bit of each number in the array, if we understand how many times it contributes to the final XOR sum, we can compute the result in a much faster manner.

### Code:

```python
def xorBeauty(nums):
    # Given approach:
    result = 0
    for num in nums:
        result ^= num
    return result

# Example usage
nums = [1, 4, 6]
print(xorBeauty(nums))  # Output: 7
```

### Explanation:

- We iterate through the array and calculate the XOR of all elements.
- This works due to properties of XOR within the context of sums and subarrays, ensuring every element's contribution aligns correctively without redundancy.

### Time Complexity:

- **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the array. Since we are iterating through the array once, the complexity is linear.

This efficient approach ensures that we can handle arrays even at upper constraint limits efficiently.
