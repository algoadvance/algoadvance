title:  Longest Nice Subarray-out
permalink: /s2401
---

You are given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers. We call a subarray of `nums` *nice* if the bitwise AND of every pair of elements that are in different positions in the subarray is equal to `0`.

Return the length of the longest *nice* subarray.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

### Example 1:
Input: `nums = [1,3,8,48,10]`
Output: `3`
Explanation: The longest nice subarray is `[3,8,48]`.

### Example 2:
Input: `nums = [3,1,5,11,13]`
Output: `1`
Explanation: The longest nice subarray is any subarray containing just one element.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints?**
   - Each number in `nums` is a positive integer.
   - `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
   - `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

2. **Output Format?**
   - The output should be a single integer representing the length of the longest nice subarray.

3. **Definition Clarification?**
   - A subarray is considered nice if for every pair of distinct elements `(i, j)` in the subarray, the bitwise AND `num[i] & num[j] = 0`.

Given these constraints and definition, we need to come up with an efficient approach.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to find the longest subarray where all elements satisfy the bitwise AND condition. Hereâ€™s the detail step-by-step plan:

1. **Sliding Window Approach:**
    - We will use two pointers `left` and `right` to represent the current window of elements.
    - We will keep expanding our window by moving the `right` pointer and check if the current window is nice (using bitwise AND).
    - If the window is not nice, we will move the `left` pointer to maintain the nice property.
    - Throughout the process, we will maintain a variable `current_AND` to store the cumulative AND of the current window.
    - Track the maximum length of the nice subarray found during this process.

## Code

```python
def longest_nice_subarray(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    left = 0
    current_AND = 0
    max_length = 0
    
    for right in range(n):
        # Try to add nums[right] to the current window
        while (current_AND & nums[right]) != 0:
            # If they are not nice, remove the left-most element
            current_AND ^= nums[left]
            left += 1
        # Add nums[right] to the current window
        current_AND |= nums[right]
        # Update the max_length
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)
    
    return max_length
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm processes each element in the array at most twice (once when expanding the window and once when contracting it), so the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a fixed number of extra variables.

This sliding window approach should efficiently solve the problem within the given constraints.
