title:  Moving Stones Until Consecutive II-out
permalink: /s1040
---
You are given an array of integers `stones` of length `n` where `stones[i]` represents the position of the `i-th` stone on the number line. The stones are not necessarily in order.

Each turn, you can move one stone from its current position to any other position on the integer line that isn't occupied by another stone.

The goal is to make the positions of the stones consecutive. You need to return an array of two integers:
1. The minimum number of moves required to make the stones consecutive.
2. The maximum number of moves required to make the stones consecutive.

The stones are unique and the array length will be in the range of `[1, 10^4]`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Should the stones be sorted at the beginning of the procedure?
2. Can we move a stone only once per turn?
3. In the result, should the minimum and maximum number of moves be based directly on the given positions, or do they need to be recalculated dynamically?

## Strategy
1. **Sorting**:
   - Begin by sorting the array of stones to easily calculate gaps and boundaries.

2. **Min Moves Calculation**:
   - Examine windows of size `n` within which all `n` stones can fit consecutively.
   - For each window, calculate the number of empty positions (or gaps).
   - The minimum number of moves would be the smallest number of gaps found in these windows.
   - Handle the edge case with two empty spaces separately.

3. **Max Moves Calculation**:
   - Place the largest and smallest stones to maximize the gaps.
   - Calculate the number of moves by moving the current outer stones (largest and smallest) to adjacent positions until they overlap.

4. **Iterate**:
   - Iterate through possible positions to find the optimal window for minimum and maximum moves.

## Code

```python
def numMovesStonesII(stones):
    stones.sort()
    n = len(stones)
    
    # Calculate the maximum moves
    max_moves = max(stones[-1] - stones[1] - (n - 2), stones[-2] - stones[0] - (n - 2))
    
    # Calculate the minimum moves
    min_moves = float('inf')
    j = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        while j + 1 < n and stones[j + 1] - stones[i] < n:
            j += 1
        if j - i + 1 == n - 1 and stones[j] - stones[i] == n - 2:
            # edge case where there are n-1 stones placed consecutively and 1 stone apart
            min_moves = min(min_moves, 2)
        else:
            min_moves = min(min_moves, n - (j - i + 1))
    
    return [min_moves, max_moves]

# Example usage
print(numMovesStonesII([7,4,9]))  # Example output: [1, 2]
print(numMovesStonesII([6,5,4,3,10]))  # Example output: [2, 3]
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Sorting**: \(O(n \log n)\)
2. **Sliding Window**: \(O(n)\)

Overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, thus the time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

This code ensures that the minimum and maximum number of moves are calculated efficiently by leveraging sorting and sliding window techniques.
