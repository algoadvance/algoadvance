title:  Largest Palindrome Product-out
permalink: /s479
---
You are given an integer `n`. You need to return the largest palindrome that can be made from the product of two `n`-digit numbers. Since the result can be very large, return it modulo `1337`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - The value of `n` can be assumed to be between 1 and 8 (as per typical constraints in the problem description).

2. **What is the form of the input?**
   - The input `n` will be a single integer.

3. **What should be returned?**
   - The largest palindrome that is the product of two `n`-digit numbers, modulo `1337`.

### Strategy
1. **Identify Bounds:** Find the range of `n`-digit numbers. The smallest `n`-digit number is `10^(n-1)`, and the largest `n`-digit number is `10^n - 1`.

2. **Form Nested Loops:** Use two nested loops to iterate through all pairs of `n`-digit numbers, starting from the largest and decrementing.

3. **Check for Palindrome:** For each product, check if it is a palindrome. If it is, track the largest palindrome found.

4. **Modulo Operation:** Since the result can be large, apply modulo `1337` to the largest palindrome found before returning it.

5. **Optimization:** Since we want the largest palindrome, we can break early from the loop if multiplying by smaller numbers would not yield a larger palindrome than currently found.

### Code
Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
def largestPalindrome(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 1:
        return 9
    upper = 10 ** n - 1
    lower = 10 ** (n - 1)
    max_number = upper * upper
    
    # Find the highest possible palindrome less than or equal to max_number
    while True:
        # Convert to string to easily check if it is a palindrome
        str_palindrome = str(max_number)
        if str_palindrome == str_palindrome[::-1]:
            palindrome = int(str_palindrome)
            for i in range(upper, lower - 1, -1):
                if palindrome // i > upper:
                    break
                if palindrome % i == 0:
                    return palindrome % 1337
        max_number -= 1

# Example usage:
# n = 2
# print(largestPalindrome(n))  # Output: 987
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is primarily dependent on the nested loops used to iterate through the products of `n`-digit numbers.
- Each loop runs roughly `10^n` times. Optimizations reduce the number of checks but in the worst-case scenario, it remains \(O((10^n)^2)\).
- Checking if a number is a palindrome is \(O(\log_{10}(n))\), which is minimal compared to the product iterations.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O((10^n)^2)\) within the constraints provided.
