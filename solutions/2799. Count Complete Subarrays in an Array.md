title:  Count Complete Subarrays in an Array-out
permalink: /s2799

You are given an array of integers. Your task is to count the number of complete subarrays. A subarray is considered complete if it contains every distinct element from the original array at least once.

Formally, given an integer array `nums`, return the number of complete subarrays. A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

## Clarifying Questions
Before we start solving the problem, let's clarify some details:
1. What is the definition of a complete subarray?
   - A subarray that contains every distinct element from the original array at least once.

2. Is the array allowed to have duplicates?
   - Yes, the array can have duplicates.

3. What are the size constraints on the array?
   - There are no explicit size constraints given in the problem statement.

4. Should we consider the term "subarray" strictly continuous?
   - Yes, subarrays are contiguous subsequences.

## Strategy
1. **Identify Distinct Elements**: First, identify all the distinct elements in the given array.
2. **Sliding Window**: Use the sliding window technique to find all subarrays that contain all distinct elements at least once.
3. **Count Complete Subarrays**: Initialize pointers to maintain a window and adjust the window size until it forms a complete subarray. Count all such valid subarrays.

### Detailed Steps:
1. Traverse the array to find all distinct elements and store them in a set.
2. Use a sliding window approach with two pointers (start and end) to find all valid subarrays:
   - Expand the window by moving the `end` pointer to the right and include new elements from the array.
   - Once the window contains all distinct elements, try to contract it from the left by moving the `start` pointer to the right, but ensure itâ€™s still a complete subarray.
   - Count all valid subarrays as we adjust the window.

### Code Implementation

```python
def countCompleteSubarrays(nums):
    from collections import defaultdict

    # Step 1: Find all distinct elements
    distinct_elements = set(nums)
    total_distinct_count = len(distinct_elements)

    # Step 2: Sliding window to find complete subarrays
    start = 0
    count = 0
    freq_map = defaultdict(int)
    found_count = 0

    for end in range(len(nums)):
        # Expand the window by including nums[end]
        if freq_map[nums[end]] == 0:
            found_count += 1
        freq_map[nums[end]] += 1

        # Contract the window to count subarrays
        while found_count == total_distinct_count:
            # Count all subarrays from start to end
            count += len(nums) - end
            
            # Move the start pointer to the right
            freq_map[nums[start]] -= 1
            if freq_map[nums[start]] == 0:
                found_count -= 1
            start += 1

    return count
```

## Time Complexity
- **Finding distinct elements**: O(N), where N is the number of elements in the array.
- **Sliding window traversal**: O(N), since each element is processed at most twice (once by the end pointer and once by the start pointer).
  
So, the overall time complexity is O(N).

This should provide an efficient solution to count the number of complete subarrays in a given array.
