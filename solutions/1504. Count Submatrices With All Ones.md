title:  Count Submatrices With All Ones-out
permalink: /s1504
---
Given an `m x n` binary matrix, return the number of submatrices that have all ones.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the submatrices be of any size, as long as all their elements are `1`?
   - Yes, submatrices can be of any size.
2. Are there any constraints on the size of the matrix (m and n)?
   - Typically, the matrix can be up to 150 rows and columns based on LeetCode constraints.
3. Is there a specific desired time complexity for this problem?
   - The goal is to have an efficient solution, ideally better than O(m^3 * n^3).

## Strategy
1. For each row of the matrix, we first compute the number of continuous ones ending in each cell.
2. Use a method to count all the possible submatrices with all ones using the computed values.

### Detailed Steps:
1. Calculate the prefix sums for each row where each cell will contain the number of consecutive ones ending at that cell.
2. For each column j, iterate over the row i, and for each cell (i, j), calculate the number of submatrices that end at (i, j).
3. Use dynamic programming to count the number of such submatrices efficiently.

### Code
```python
def numSubmat(mat):
    m, n = len(mat), len(mat[0])
    
    # Step 1: Precompute the number of consecutive ones ending at each cell.
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if mat[i][j] == 1:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + 1 if j > 0 else 1
    
    # Step 2: Count submatrices ending at each cell.
    result = 0
    
    for j in range(n):
        for i in range(m):
            min_width = dp[i][j]
            for k in range(i, -1, -1):  # From row i to the top (row 0)
                if dp[k][j] == 0:
                    break
                min_width = min(min_width, dp[k][j])
                result += min_width
                
    return result

# Example usage:
mat = [
    [1,0,1],
    [1,1,0],
    [1,1,0]
]
print(numSubmat(mat)) # Output: 13
```

### Explanation:
1. **Precompute consecutive ones:** The `dp` matrix is filled where each cell `[i][j]` holds the number of consecutive `1`s ending at that cell `(i, j)`.
2. **Count submatrices:** For each cell `(i, j)`, calculate the minimum width of consecutive ones from the current row up to the top row and count the possible submatrices. The `min_width` is updated to ensure all rows considered form valid submatrices. 

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is `O(m * n * m)`:
- `O(m * n)` for filling out the `dp` matrix.
- `O(m * n * m)` for counting submatrices since, for each cell `(i, j)`, we potentially iterate up `m` times through the rows to count valid submatrices.

This is more efficient than checking all possible submatrices directly and should perform well within the given constraints.
