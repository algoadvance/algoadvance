title:  Construct String With Repeat Limit-out
permalink: /s2182
---

Given a string `s` and an integer `repeatLimit`, construct a new string such that no letter appears more than `repeatLimit` times in a row. You need to obtain the largest lexicographical string possible. 

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are the characters in `s` only lowercase English letters?
   **A:** Yes, the problem typically involves lowercase English letters.

2. **Q:** Can `s` be empty?
   **A:** No, as per the problem constraints, `s` is a non-empty string.

3. **Q:** Can `repeatLimit` be greater than the length of `s`?
   **A:** Yes, if `repeatLimit` is greater than the length of `s`, then no characters will be repeated more times than allowed.

4. **Q:** What should we do if it is impossible to construct a valid string under these constraints?
   **A:** The constraints suggest a solution will always be possible with the given inputs.

### Strategy

1. **Count Characters**: First, count the frequency of each character in the string.
2. **Sort Characters**: Sort characters in descending order to start with the largest lexicographical character.
3. **Construct Result**: Construct the result string by appending characters based on the `repeatLimit`. If a character reaches its repeat limit, append the next possible largest character temporarily and then switch back.

### Pseudocode

1. Count the frequencies of each character in `s`.
2. Sort the characters by their lexicographical order in descending order.
3. Use a while loop to construct the new string:
   - Add the largest possible character up to `repeatLimit`.
   - If need be, insert the next largest character temporarily and repeat.

### Example

- Input: `s = "cczccczzz"`, `repeatLimit = 3`
- Output: `zzzczzcccz`

### Code

Here's the Python solution implementing the strategy:

```python
from collections import Counter
import heapq

def repeatLimitedString(s: str, repeatLimit: int) -> str:
    freq = Counter(s)
    max_heap = []
    
    # Create a max-heap based on frequencies and lexicographical order
    for char, f in freq.items():
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-ord(char), f))
    
    result = []
    
    while max_heap:
        char_ord, f = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
        char = chr(-char_ord)
        
        # Determine the number of times to repeat this char
        repeat = min(f, repeatLimit)
        if result and result[-1] == char:
            # If the last character is the same and we have to break the limit
            if not max_heap:
                break  # No more characters to use for breaking the repetition
                
            # Use the next largest character temporarily
            next_char_ord, next_f = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            next_char = chr(-next_char_ord)
            result.append(next_char)
            
            # Decrease the frequency and push it back if there are still some left
            if next_f > 1:
                heapq.heappush(max_heap, (next_char_ord, next_f - 1))
                
            # Push the previous character back since we didn't use it fully
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (char_ord, f))
        else:
            result.extend([char] * repeat)
            if f > repeat:
                heapq.heappush(max_heap, (char_ord, f - repeat))
    
    return ''.join(result)
```

### Time Complexity

- **Heap Operations:** Each character is pushed and popped from the heap, resulting in `O(n log n)` complexity.
- **Overall Complexity:** Counting frequencies takes `O(n)`, and heap operations take `O(n log n)`, making the total time complexity `O(n log n)`.

The solution efficiently maintains the constraints and constructs the largest lexicographical string possible within the repeat limits.
