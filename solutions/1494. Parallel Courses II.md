title:  Parallel Courses II-out
permalink: /s1494
---

Given the integer `n` which signifies the number of courses, and a list of pairs `dependencies` where `dependencies[i] = [xi, yi]` representing that you must take course `xi` before course `yi`, as well as the integer `k`, representing the maximum number of courses you can take in a single semester, return the minimum number of semesters required to complete all the courses.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Cycle Presence**: Do we need to handle cases where there might be cyclical dependencies?
    - **Response**: No, you may assume there are no cycles in the dependency graph.

2. **Course Indexing**: What is the range of the course indices?
    - **Response**: Courses are numbered from 1 to n.

### Strategy

#### Steps and Approach:
1. **Graph Representation**:
    - Represent the courses and their dependencies using adjacency lists and indegree arrays.
    
2. **Dynamic Programming with Bitmask**:
    - Use a bitmask to represent the states of courses taken so far.
    - Use dynamic programming to store the minimum semesters required to complete up to that bitmask state.
    
3. **Topological Sorting**:
    - Maintain an array of courses that can be taken in the current semester based on indegrees from the current bitmask state.
    - Iterate through all subsets of these courses up to size `k` and update the bitmask DP table for the next state.

#### Algorithm:
1. Initialize the adjacency list and the indegree array.
2. Use a bitmask `dp` array to track the minimum semesters needed for each set of taken courses.
3. Iterate until all courses have been taken (i.e., we reach the final bitmask state where all bits are set to 1).
4. For each state, compute the list of courses that can be taken. For each subset of these courses of size up to `k`, update the `dp` state.

### Time Complexity:
The algorithm uses bit manipulation extensively leading to a time complexity of \(O(2^n \cdot n^2)\), which is feasible when \(n \leq 15\).

### Python Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque
from itertools import combinations

def minNumberOfSemesters(n, dependencies, k):
    # Adjacency list and indegree count
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    indegree = [0] * n
    
    # Build the graph and indegree array
    for u, v in dependencies:
        graph[u-1].append(v-1)
        indegree[v-1] += 1
        
    # DP table for Bitmask DP
    dp = [float('inf')] * (1 << n)
    dp[0] = 0
    
    # Iterate through all the states
    for state in range(1 << n):
        if dp[state] == float('inf'):
            continue
        
        # Calculate courses that can be taken in the current semester
        available_courses = []
        for i in range(n):
            if state & (1 << i) == 0 and indegree[i] == 0:
                is_prereq_taken = True
                for pre in graph[i]:
                    if state & (1 << pre) == 0:
                        is_prereq_taken = False
                        break
                if is_prereq_taken:
                    available_courses.append(i)
        
        # Iterate through all subsets of available courses of size up to k
        for num_courses in range(1, min(k, len(available_courses)) + 1):
            for subset in combinations(available_courses, num_courses):
                next_state = state
                for course in subset:
                    next_state |= (1 << course)
                dp[next_state] = min(dp[next_state], dp[state] + 1)
    
    # The final state is all courses taken which is (1 << n) - 1
    return dp[(1 << n) - 1]

# Example usage
n = 4
dependencies = [[2,1],[3,1],[1,4]]
k = 2
print(minNumberOfSemesters(n, dependencies, k))  # Output: 3
```

By using a bitmask to represent which courses have been taken and dynamic programming to store the minimum number of terms to complete the coursework up to that point, this approach efficiently determines the minimum number of semesters needed.
