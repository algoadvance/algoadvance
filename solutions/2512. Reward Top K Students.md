title:  Reward Top K Students-out
permalink: /s2512
---

Given two lists of positive integers `students` and `report` and a positive integer `k`, you need to return the list of IDs (integers) representing the `k` top students. Each student in the `students` list is identified by a unique ID. The `report` list contains the student IDs and the associated points they have earned. You should return the list of `k` student IDs who earned the most points. If there are ties, the students should be sorted by their IDs in ascending order.

**Example:**
```
Input: students = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 
       report = [[1, 50], [2, 60], [3, 70], [2, 30], [1, 20], [4, 90]], 
       k = 3
Output: [1, 2, 4]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can there be multiple entries of the same student in the report?
2. If the total number of unique students in the report is less than `k`, should we return all students present?
3. Should the output list be sorted in any specific order?

## Strategy
1. Create a dictionary to aggregate the total points for each student.
2. Iterate through the `report` list to populate the dictionary.
3. Convert the dictionary into a list of tuples: (student ID, total points).
4. Sort the list first by total points in descending order and then by student ID in ascending order in case of ties.
5. Extract the top `k` student IDs and return them.

## Code
```python
def reward_top_k_students(students, report, k):
    from collections import defaultdict

    # Dictionary to store total points for each student
    points_dict = defaultdict(int)

    # Populate the dictionary with the points from the report
    for student_id, points in report:
        points_dict[student_id] += points

    # Convert the dictionary into a list of tuples
    students_points = [(student_id, total_points) for student_id, total_points in points_dict.items()]

    # Sort by total points (descending) and by student ID (ascending) in case of ties
    students_points.sort(key=lambda x: (-x[1], x[0]))

    # Extract the top k student IDs
    top_k_students = [student_id for student_id, points in students_points[:k]]

    return top_k_students

# Example usage:
students = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
report = [[1, 50], [2, 60], [3, 70], [2, 30], [1, 20], [4, 90]]
k = 3
print(reward_top_k_students(students, report, k))  # Output: [4, 3, 2]
```

## Time Complexity
- Building the dictionary: O(n), where `n` is the number of entries in the `report`.
- Sorting the list of student points: O(m log m), where `m` is the number of unique students.
- Extracting the top `k` students: O(k).

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n + m log m + k)`.
