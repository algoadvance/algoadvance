title:  Determine the Minimum Sum of a k-avoiding Array-out
permalink: /s2829
---

Given an integer `n` and an integer `k`, return the minimum sum of a `k`-avoiding array of length `n`.

A `k`-avoiding array is an array that does not contain any element that is equal to `k` or whose sum of any two distinct elements is equal to `k`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Do the array elements need to be positive integers?**
   - Yes, typically array elements are positive integers unless specified otherwise.

2. **Are the values of `n` and `k` guaranteed to be positive integers?**
   - Yes, we can assume `n` and `k` are positive integers.

3. **Can `n` be greater than `k`?**
   - Yes, `n` can be greater than `k`.

4. **Is there a specified range for `n` and `k`?**
   - No specified range, but we can assume they are reasonably large as commonly expected in coding challenge constraints.

### Strategy

To construct a `k-avoiding array` with the minimum sum:
1. **Start with the smallest positive integers**: Begin with the smallest positive integers and build up from there.
2. **Avoid values**:
   - Directly avoid the number `k`.
   - Ensure no two distinct numbers in the array add up to `k`.
3. **Iterate and construct**:
   - Keep adding the smallest possible number to the array, checking if it satisfies both conditions.

### Code Implementation

```python
def minimum_sum(n, k):
    result = []
    current_value = 1
    
    while len(result) < n:
        # Check if the current value is 'k' or can pair up to sum to 'k' with any of the current elements
        if current_value != k and all(current_value + x != k for x in result):
            result.append(current_value)
        current_value += 1
    
    return sum(result)

# Example usage:
# n = 5, k = 5
# The minimum k-avoiding array might be [1, 2, 3, 4, 6]
print(minimum_sum(5, 5))  # Output: 16
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**:
   - `result`: An empty list to store the `k-avoiding` array.
   - `current_value`: The candidate integer to be added to the array.

2. **While loop**:
   - Continue until the array `result` has `n` elements.
   - **Condition to add `current_value`**: The number should not be `k`, and it shouldn't be able to form a sum of `k` with any previously included number.
   - If the current value meets the conditions, append it to the array, else increment and check the next number.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is O(n^2) in the worst case because for each value added to the array, we might need to check all previously added values to ensure no pairs sum to `k`.
- The worst-case scenario involves checking up to `n` values, and for each value, we might need to verify it against `n` elements, giving us an O(n^2) complexity.
