title:  Equal Rational Numbers-out
permalink: /s972
---
Given two strings `s` and `t`, each representing a rational number, determine whether they represent the same rational number. A rational number can be represented in a variety of forms. For example, `0.5`, `0.50`, and `0.5000` are all representations of the same rational number.

A rational number also means a number which might have recurring decimal fractions. For instance, `0.(52)` means repeating `52` forever and is equivalent to `0.525252...`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints for the input strings?**
   - The strings will only contain digits, a single decimal point, and possibly parentheses for recurring decimals.

2. **Can the numbers be negative?**
   - No, the problem only expects non-negative rational numbers.

3. **How long can the input strings be?**
   - Typically, constraints are not given explicitly, but strings could be reasonably long given their nature.

4. **Will the strings always represent valid rational numbers?**
   - Yes, for the context of this problem, it is assumed that the inputs are always valid representations of rational numbers.

### Strategy
1. **Normalization:** Convert each rational number into a canonical form that can be easily compared. This might involve:
   - Handling integer parts if any.
   - Dealing with non-repeating decimal parts.
   - Unrolling repeating decimals to a fixed length for comparison.
   
2. **Comparison:** Once both strings are normalized into a standard comparable format, perform a straightforward string comparison.

### Code

Here is a Python function to solve the problem:

```python
def normalizeRational(s: str) -> str:
    if '(' in s:
        non_repeat_part, repeat_part = s.split('(')
        repeat_part = repeat_part.rstrip(')')
    else:
        non_repeat_part, repeat_part = s, ''

    if '.' in non_repeat_part:
        int_part, dec_part = non_repeat_part.split('.')
    else:
        int_part, dec_part = non_repeat_part, ''

    if repeat_part:
        dec_part += repeat_part * (50 // len(repeat_part) + 1)
    
    significant_length = max(len(dec_part), 50)
    dec_part = (dec_part + '0' * significant_length)[:50]

    return f"{int_part}.{dec_part}"

def isRationalEqual(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    return normalizeRational(s) == normalizeRational(t)

# Example usage
s1 = "0.5"
t1 = "0.50"
print(isRationalEqual(s1, t1))  # True

s2 = "0.1(6)"
t2 = "0.1666(6)"
print(isRationalEqual(s2, t2))  # True

s3 = "0.9(9)"
t3 = "1.0"
print(isRationalEqual(s3, t3))  # True

s4 = "0.413(23)"
t4 = "0.413(2323)"
print(isRationalEqual(s4, t4))  # True

s5 = "0.(52)"
t5 = "0.52(52)"
print(isRationalEqual(s5, t5))  # True
```

### Time Complexity
- **Normalization**: Processing each string involves handling the integer, non-repeating, and repeating parts, which are all linear operations based on the length of the string. This results in O(N) time complexity for each string.
- **Comparison**: The time taken to compare two strings is linear based on their lengths, resulting in O(N) as well.

Overall, the time complexity is O(N) for each input string and we do this for two strings, making it O(2N) which simplifies to O(N).
