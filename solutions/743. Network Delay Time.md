1. **What is the input to this problem?**
   - A list of `times`, where each element `times[i]` is of the form `[u, v, w]`, representing a directed edge from node `u` to node `v` with travel time `w`.
   - An integer `N`, representing the total number of nodes.
   - An integer `K`, representing the starting node.

2. **What is the expected output?**
   - The minimum time it will take for all nodes to receive the signal sent from node `K`. If it is impossible for all nodes to receive the signal, return `-1`.

3. **Can nodes have directed edges to themselves?**
   - This usually doesn't affect the outcome, but it's useful to know.

4. **Are there any constraints on travel times?**
   - Travel times are non-negative integers.

### Strategy

This problem can be solved using graph algorithms like Dijkstra's algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in a graph with non-negative weights.

1. **Data Representation**: Use an adjacency list to store the graph representation.

2. **Algorithm Choice**: Utilize Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest time to each node starting from node `K`.

3. **Priority Queue**: Use a priority queue (min-heap) to always extend the shortest known path.

### Steps:

1. Create an adjacency list to represent the graph.
2. Use a min-heap (priority queue) initialized with the starting node `K`.
3. Use a dictionary to store the shortest known travel time to each node.
4. Iterate until the priority queue is empty:
   - Extract the node with the smallest travel time.
   - Update travel times to its neighbors.
   - Add/Update neighbors in the priority queue.
5. After the loop, check if all nodes are reachable.
6. Return the maximum travel time in the dictionary if all nodes are reachable; otherwise, return `-1`.

### Time Complexity

- Building the adjacency list: \(O(E)\)
- Dijkstra's algorithm (using a min-heap): \(O((V + E) \log V)\)

where `V` is the number of nodes and `E` is the number of edges.

### Implementation

Let's go ahead and implement this:

```python
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict

def networkDelayTime(times, N, K):
    # Create a graph in the form of an adjacency list
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v, w in times:
        graph[u].append((w, v))
    
    # Priority queue to hold (travel_time, node)
    min_heap = [(0, K)]
    
    # Dictionary to store the shortest travel time to each node
    shortest_time = {}
    
    while min_heap:
        travel_time, node = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        
        if node in shortest_time:
            continue
        
        shortest_time[node] = travel_time
        
        for time, neighbor in graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in shortest_time:
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, (travel_time + time, neighbor))
    
    # Check if we visited all nodes
    if len(shortest_time) == N:
        return max(shortest_time.values())
    else:
        return -1

# Example usage
times = [[2,1,1],[2,3,1],[3,4,1]]
N = 4
K = 2
print(networkDelayTime(times, N, K))  # Output: 2
```

### Explanation

1. **Graph Construction (Adjacency List)**:
   - We populate the graph structure with the input edges.

2. **Priority Queue Initialization**:
   - We initialize the priority queue with the starting node `K` and a travel time of `0`.

3. **Processing Nodes**:
   - While there are nodes in the priority queue, we process each node by extending paths to its neighbors if a shorter path is found.

4. **Checking Reachability**:
   - After processing, we check if we have the shortest paths to all `N` nodes. If true, we return the maximum travel time; otherwise, `-1`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the shortest path to each node in the network using Dijkstra's algorithm with a min-heap.
