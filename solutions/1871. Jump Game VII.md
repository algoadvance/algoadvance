You are given a binary string `s` and two integers `minJump` and `maxJump`. In the binary string `s`, '0' represents a position that can be jumped to, and '1' represents a position that cannot be jumped to.

You need to determine if you can reach the last index of the string by jumping from index 0. You are initially positioned at index 0, and from index `i`, you can jump to any index `j` where `i + minJump <= j <= i + maxJump` and `s[j] == '0'`.

Return `True` if you can reach the last index of the string, or `False` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are minJump and maxJump fixed for all jumps?**
   - Yes, they are fixed for all jumps.

2. **Is the input guaranteed to be a valid binary string?**
   - Yes, it can be assumed that the input string `s` is a valid binary string.

3. **What's the maximum length of the string `s`?**
   - The length of the string `s` can be up to \(10^5\).

4. **What if the string length is less than minJump?**
   - We should handle this scenario and return `False` if it's not possible to start or perform a jump.

### Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: 
   - Use a queue to explore possible positions we can jump to.
   - Start from index 0 and explore all positions between `i + minJump` and `i + maxJump` for each position `i` in the current level of BFS.

2. **Sliding-Window Optimization**:
   - Keep track of the furthest position we've reached to prevent re-examining the same positions.
   - Mark positions that are reachable as we explore them to prevent multiple visits.

### Code

```python
from collections import deque

def canReach(s: str, minJump: int, maxJump: int) -> bool:
    n = len(s)
    
    if s[n-1] != '0':
        return False  # If the last character is not '0', we can never reach it.
    
    queue = deque([0])
    furthest = 0
    
    while queue:
        i = queue.popleft()
        
        # We should start checking from max(furthest + 1, i + minJump) to avoid revisiting positions
        for j in range(max(furthest + 1, i + minJump), min(n, i + maxJump + 1)):
            if s[j] == '0':
                if j == n - 1:
                    return True
                queue.append(j)
        
        # Update the furthest position
        furthest = max(furthest, i + maxJump)
    
    return False

# Example usage
print(canReach("011010", 2, 3))  # Output: True
print(canReach("01101110", 2, 3))  # Output: False
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**: 
   - The major operations include enqueuing and dequeuing elements which will be performed at most \(O(n)\) times.
   - Inside the loop, each position is visited once, making the overall time complexity \(O(n)\).

2. **Space Complexity**: 
   - The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the queue that can store indices up to the length of the string.

This approach ensures efficient checking and prevents redundant calculations, making it suitable for strings of length up to \(10^5\).
