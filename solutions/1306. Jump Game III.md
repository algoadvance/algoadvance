You are given a list of non-negative integers `arr`, and a starting index `start`. When you are at the index `i`, you can jump to `i + arr[i]` or `i - arr[i]` as long as you stay in the boundaries of the array. Return `True` if you can reach any index with a value of 0, otherwise, return `False`.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: arr = [4,2,3,0,3,1,2], start = 5
Output: True
Explanation: Either index 5 -> index 4 -> index 1 -> index 3 or index 5 -> index 6 -> index 4 -> index 1 -> index 3

Input: arr = [4,2,3,0,3,1,2], start = 0
Output: True
Explanation: Either index 0 -> index 4 -> index 1 -> index 3 or index 0 -> index 4 -> index 6 -> index 5 -> index 3

Input: arr = [3,0,2,1,2], start = 2
Output: False
Explanation: There is no way to reach a 0
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the values in the array guaranteed to be non-negative integers?**
   Yes, based on the problem statement, all values are non-negative.
   
2. **Can the start index be outside the array boundaries?**
   No, the `start` index will be a valid index within the array boundaries according to the problem statement.

3. **Are there any constraints on the size of the array?**
   The problem doesn't specify, but typically LeetCode problems keep array sizes within a manageable limit, so we can assume that our solution must handle reasonably large arrays efficiently.

### Strategy

To solve this, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to explore all reachable indices from the given start index.

1. **BFS Approach:**
   - Use a queue to keep track of indices to visit.
   - Use a set to track visited indices to prevent cycles.
   - Initially add the start index to the queue.
   - While the queue is not empty, pull an index from the queue.
   - Check if this index has the value 0. If yes, return True.
   - Otherwise, add the reachable indices (i + arr[i] and i - arr[i]) to the queue if they have not been visited yet and are within array boundaries.
   - If the queue is exhausted, return False.

### Code

```python
from collections import deque

def canReach(arr, start):
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = set()
    
    while queue:
        index = queue.popleft()
        
        # Check if index is already visited
        if index in visited:
            continue
        
        # Mark this index as visited
        visited.add(index)
        
        # Check if we have reached a zero
        if arr[index] == 0:
            return True
        
        # Calculate the next possible indices
        next_indices = [index + arr[index], index - arr[index]]
        
        for next_index in next_indices:
            if 0 <= next_index < len(arr) and next_index not in visited:
                queue.append(next_index)

    return False
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of elements in the array. Every element will be put into the queue at most once and visited at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N) for the queue and the visited set.

This solution should handle typical constraints efficiently and robustly.
