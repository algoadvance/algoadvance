1. What is the structure of the input? - The input consists of a binary tree and an integer target sum.
2. Can the tree contain negative values? - Yes, the tree can contain negative values.
3. What should be returned? - We need to return `True` if there exists a root-to-leaf path such that the sum of the node values equals the target sum, otherwise `False`.
4. Definition of a leaf node? - A leaf node is a node with no children.

## Strategy:
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - We can use a depth-first search approach to explore all paths from the root to the leaf nodes.
   - At each node, subtract the node's value from the target sum and check if we have reached a leaf node.
   - If we reach a leaf node and the remaining target sum is zero, then we have found a valid path.
2. **Recursive Function**:
   - Create a helper recursive function that traverses the tree and checks the sums.
3. **Base Case**:
   - If the current node is `None`, return `False` (we’ve reached beyond a leaf without success).
   - If it’s a leaf node and the current sum is zero after subtracting the node’s value, return `True`.

```python
## Code Implementation

# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def hasPathSum(root: TreeNode, target_sum: int) -> bool:
    # Helper function to perform the DFS
    def dfs(node: TreeNode, current_sum: int) -> bool:
        if not node:
            return False
        
        current_sum -= node.val
        
        if not node.left and not node.right:  # if it's a leaf node
            return current_sum == 0
        
        return dfs(node.left, current_sum) or dfs(node.right, current_sum)

    return dfs(root, target_sum)
```

## Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because, in the worst case, we must visit every node once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H) where H is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack.
