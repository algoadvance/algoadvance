title:  Maximum Value Sum by Placing Three Rooks I-out
permalink: /s3256
---

You are given an N x N chessboard. Each cell on the chessboard has a certain value associated with it. You need to place three rooks on non-attacking positions (i.e., no two rooks can be in the same row or column). Your task is to determine the maximum sum of values of the cells where the three rooks are placed.

**Input:**
- A single integer `N` representing the size of the chessboard.
- A 2D list `board` of size `N x N`, where `board[i][j]` represents the value associated with the cell at row `i` and column `j`.

**Output:**
- Return the maximum sum of values of the cells where the three rooks are placed.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the values in the board be negative?
   **A:** Yes, the values can be negative.

2. **Q:** Is there always a solution? (i.e., is N always ≥ 3?)
   **A:** Assume N is always ≥ 3 since we need to place 3 rooks.

3. **Q:** Can we place the rooks on the diagonal?
   **A:** Yes, but the important point is they should not be on the same row or the same column.

## Strategy

1. **Select Rows and Columns:** We need to select 3 unique rows and 3 unique columns from the chessboard.
   
2. **Calculate Sum:** For each possible triplet combination of rows and columns, calculate the sum of the values in those positions.

3. **Maximize the Sum:** Track the maximum sum obtained from these combinations.

**Steps:**
1. Generate all possible combinations of 3 unique rows and 3 unique columns.
2. For each combination, calculate the sum of the selected cells' values.
3. Return the maximum sum found.

## Code

```python
from itertools import combinations

def max_value_sum(N, board):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    
    # Generate all possible row and column combinations
    rows_combinations = list(combinations(range(N), 3))
    cols_combinations = list(combinations(range(N), 3))
    
    # Iterate over all combinations of rows and columns
    for rows in rows_combinations:
        for cols in cols_combinations:
            current_sum = 0
            for r, c in zip(rows, cols):
                current_sum += board[r][c]
            max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
            
    return max_sum

# Example usage:
board = [
    [3, 1, 2],
    [4, 6, 5],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
N = 3
print(max_value_sum(N, board))  # Output should be 3 + 6 + 9 = 18
```

## Time Complexity

1. Generating combinations: \(\binom{N}{3}\) for both rows and columns.
2. Iterating over combinations: \(\left(\binom{N}{3}\right)^2\).

Considering that \(\binom{N}{3} = \mathcal{O}(N^3)\) in the worst-case scenario, our final time complexity would be:
- Combinations Generation: \(\mathcal{O}(N^3)\)
- Looping through combinations: \(\mathcal{O}(N^3 \times N^3) = \mathcal{O}(N^6)\)

So, the overall time complexity is **\(\mathcal{O}(N^6)\)**.

Given that brute force generation of combinations might become infeasible for larger \(N\), further optimization or heuristic methods might be considered for larger boards.
