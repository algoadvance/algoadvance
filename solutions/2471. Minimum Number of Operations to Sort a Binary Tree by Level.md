title:  Minimum Number of Operations to Sort a Binary Tree by Level-out
permalink: /s2471
---

You are given the root of a binary tree with `n` nodes, where each node is uniquely numbered from `1` to `n`. Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to sort the binary tree by level. 

An operation is defined as follows: swap any two nodes in the same level of the binary tree.

Write a function `minOperations(root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int` that returns the minimum number of operations required to sort the binary tree by level.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Definition of "Sort by Level":** 
    - You need to sort the values of nodes within each level of the tree in ascending order.
  
2. **Definition of an Operation:**
    - An operation consists of swapping any two nodes that are on the same level.
  
3. **Node Value Constraints:**
    - Each node value is unique and ranges from `1` to `n`.

4. **Tree Constraints:**
    - The tree has `n` nodes where `1 <= n <= 10^4`.

### Strategy

1. **Level Order Traversal:**
    - Perform a level-order traversal to gather nodes level by level.

2. **Sort Nodes Within Each Level:**
    - For each level, determine the minimum number of swaps needed to sort the nodes.

3. **Track Total Swaps:**
    - Sum up the swaps needed for each level to get the total number of operations.

### Steps:

1. **Level Order Traversal:**
    - Use a queue to traverse the binary tree level by level and collect node values for each level.

2. **Calculate Minimum Swaps:**
    - For each level, calculate the minimum swaps required to sort the nodes.
    - To determine the minimum swaps, use the concept of finding the cycle decomposition of the permutation and sum the lengths of cycles minus one.

### Code:

```python
from typing import Optional
from collections import deque, defaultdict

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def minOperations(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        if not root:
            return 0
        
        # Helper function to perform level order traversal
        def level_order(root: TreeNode) -> list:
            levels = []
            queue = deque([root])
            while queue:
                level_size = len(queue)
                current_level = []
                for _ in range(level_size):
                    node = queue.popleft()
                    current_level.append(node.val)
                    if node.left:
                        queue.append(node.left)
                    if node.right:
                        queue.append(node.right)
                levels.append(current_level)
            return levels
        
        # Function to calculate minimum swaps to sort an array
        def min_swaps_to_sort(arr: list) -> int:
            n = len(arr)
            arr_pos = [(val, idx) for idx, val in enumerate(arr)]
            arr_pos.sort()
            visited = [False] * n
            swaps = 0
            
            for i in range(n):
                if visited[i] or arr_pos[i][1] == i:
                    continue
                
                cycle_size = 0
                x = i
                while not visited[x]:
                    visited[x] = True
                    x = arr_pos[x][1]
                    cycle_size += 1
                if cycle_size > 0:
                    swaps += cycle_size - 1
            return swaps
        
        levels = level_order(root)
        total_swaps = 0
        
        for level in levels:
            total_swaps += min_swaps_to_sort(level)
        
        return total_swaps
```

### Time Complexity:

1. **Level Order Traversal:** 
    - `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.

2. **Minimum Swaps Calculation:**
    - Each level in the tree will need `O(m log m)` to sort and `O(m)` for calculating minimum swaps, where `m` is the number of nodes in that level. 
    - Summing over all levels approximately gives `O(n log n)`.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n log n)`.
