2126. Destroying Asteroids

You are given an integer `mass`, which represents the initial mass of a planet. You are also given an integer array `asteroids` where `asteroids[i]` is the mass of the `i-th` asteroid.

You can destroy an asteroid if your mass is greater than or equal to the mass of the asteroid. After you destroy an asteroid, your mass increases by the mass of the asteroid you destroyed.

Return `true` if you can destroy all the asteroids. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the mass of the asteroids or the initial mass of the planet be zero?
   **A:** The mass of the planet can have any non-negative integer value. The masses of the asteroids are positive integers.

2. **Q:** Are the masses of the asteroids given in any particular order?
   **A:** No, the masses of the asteroids are not given in any particular order.

3. **Q:** Should the function handle empty asteroids array?
   **A:** Yes, if the asteroids array is empty, the function should return `true` since there are no asteroids to destroy.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Asteroids**: Start by sorting the `asteroids` array in non-decreasing order. This way, we can always attempt to destroy the smallest asteroid first, ensuring that we maximize the chances of being able to destroy subsequent asteroids.

2. **Iterate and Destroy**: Iterate over the sorted `asteroids` array and attempt to destroy each asteroid:
   - If the current mass of the planet is greater than or equal to the asteroid's mass, then the asteroid can be destroyed, and the mass of the planet is increased by the mass of the destroyed asteroid.
   - If at any point the asteroid's mass is more than the planet's mass, return `false` immediately as it can't be destroyed.

3. **Final Check**: If all asteroids can be destroyed by the end of the iteration, return `true`.

### Code

```python
def canDestroyAllAsteroids(mass, asteroids):
    # Sort asteroids in non-decreasing order
    asteroids.sort()
    
    # Iterate through each asteroid
    for asteroid in asteroids:
        if mass >= asteroid:
            mass += asteroid  # Destroy asteroid and increase mass
        else:
            return False  # Cannot destroy this asteroid, return False
            
    return True  # All asteroids were destroyed

# Example Usage:
# mass = 10
# asteroids = [3, 9, 19, 5, 21]
# print(canDestroyAllAsteroids(mass, asteroids))  # Output: True
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting**: Sorting the `asteroids` array takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of asteroids.
2. **Iteration**: Iterating through the `asteroids` array takes \(O(n)\).

The overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it \(O(n \log n)\).

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is \(O(1)\) additional space (not considering the input storage), as we only use a few extra variables for tracking and iterating. The sorting operation typically uses \(O(n)\) space for the sort operation.
