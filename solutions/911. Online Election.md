You are given two arrays: `persons` and `times`. The `persons` array contains integers where each integer represents a vote for a person at the corresponding time in the `times` array. More specifically, every entry in the `persons` array at index `i` indicates that the person `persons[i]` received a vote at `times[i]`.

Implement the `TopVotedCandidate` class:

- `TopVotedCandidate(int[] persons, int[] times)` Initializes the object with the `persons` and `times` arrays.
- `int q(int t)` Returns the number of the person that was leading the election at time `t`. If there is a tie, the most recent vote (among the ties) wins.

### Example:
```
Input:
["TopVotedCandidate", "q", "q", "q", "q", "q", "q"]
[[[0,1,1,0,0,1,0], [0,5,10,15,20,25,30]], [3], [12], [25], [15], [24], [8]]

Output:
[null, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]

Explanation:
TopVotedCandidate topVotedCandidate = new TopVotedCandidate([0,1,1,0,0,1,0], [0,5,10,15,20,25,30]);
topVotedCandidate.q(3); // return 0, the votes are [0] and the leader is 0.
topVotedCandidate.q(12); // return 1, the votes are [0,1,1] and the leader is 1.
topVotedCandidate.q(25); // return 1, the votes are [0,1,1,0,0,1] the leader is 1.
topVotedCandidate.q(15); // return 0
topVotedCandidate.q(24); // return 0
topVotedCandidate.q(8); // return 1
```

## Clarifying Questions:

1. Are the `persons` and `times` arrays always of the same length?
2. Can we assume that `times` array is already sorted?
3. What are the constraints on the number of entries in `persons` and `times` arrays?
4. Will the `times` array always contain distinct values, meaning no two votes can happen at the same time?

## Strategy:

1. **Initialization**: To initialize the `TopVotedCandidate` object, we need to keep track of the cumulative votes each person has received at each time point. We'll also record who the leader is at each point in time in a dictionary.

2. **Lead Calculation**: We can maintain a dictionary to count the votes for each person and keep track of the leader using another list.

3. **Query (`q`) Method**: For quickly finding the leader at any given time, we will use binary search to find the latest time that does not exceed `t` in the `times` array. The leader at that time will be the result.

## Code:
```python
from typing import List
from collections import defaultdict
import bisect

class TopVotedCandidate:
    def __init__(self, persons: List[int], times: List[int]):
        self.leading_at_time = []  # List of tuples (time, leader)
        self.times = times  # Keep the times for binary search
        vote_counts = defaultdict(int)
        leader = -1
        max_votes = 0

        for time, person in zip(times, persons):
            vote_counts[person] += 1
            
            if vote_counts[person] >= max_votes:
                if vote_counts[person] > max_votes or leader != person:
                    leader = person
                    max_votes = vote_counts[person]
            
            self.leading_at_time.append((time, leader))

    def q(self, t: int) -> int:
        idx = bisect.bisect_right(self.times, t) - 1
        return self.leading_at_time[idx][1]

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    topVotedCandidate = TopVotedCandidate([0,1,1,0,0,1,0], [0,5,10,15,20,25,30])
    print(topVotedCandidate.q(3))   # Output: 0
    print(topVotedCandidate.q(12))  # Output: 1
    print(topVotedCandidate.q(25))  # Output: 1
    print(topVotedCandidate.q(15))  # Output: 0
    print(topVotedCandidate.q(24))  # Output: 0
    print(topVotedCandidate.q(8))   # Output: 1
```

## Time Complexity:
- **Initialization**: O(N), where N is the length of the `persons` or `times` array.
- **Query (`q`) Method**: O(log N) for the binary search to find the relevant time index.
