You are given an integer `maxChoosableInteger` and a desired `total`. You and an opponent take turns picking numbers from `1` to `maxChoosableInteger` (inclusive) without replacement. The player who first reaches or exceeds the desired `total` wins. Assuming both players play optimally, return `true` if the first player can guarantee a win, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is input validation needed?**
   - No, assume the inputs are valid integers within a reasonable range.

2. **Can `maxChoosableInteger` be larger than `total`?**
   - Yes, `maxChoosableInteger` can be larger or smaller than `total`.

3. **Can numbers be picked more than once?**
   - No, each number can only be picked once.

4. **What does it mean to play "optimally"?**
   - Both players will make the move that maximizes their chances of winning.

5. **What are the constraints of the problem?**
   - `1 <= maxChoosableInteger <= 20`
   - `0 <= desiredTotal <= 300`

### Strategy
1. **Recursive Backtracking with Memorization:**
   - We aim to simulate the game using recursion. A memoization table will be used to store already computed states to avoid re-computation.
   - Use a bitmask to keep track of the numbers that have been chosen so far.

2. **Base Cases:**
   - If `total <= 0`, the player cannot win.
   - If `maxChoosableInteger >= total`, the first player can directly choose `total` and win.

3. **Recursive Function:**
   - The function will simulate the game, deciding whether there's a guaranteed win based on the current state.
   - Use memoization to store states (chosen numbers).

4. **Bitmasking:**
   - To efficiently track chosen numbers, a bitmask will be used.

5. **Winning Strategy:**
   - For each number not picked yet, recursively determine if choosing that number leads to a win.

### Code

```python
def canIWin(maxChoosableInteger, desiredTotal):
    if desiredTotal <= 0:
        return True
    if sum(range(1, maxChoosableInteger + 1)) < desiredTotal:
        return False

    memo = {}

    def can_win(remaining, chosen):
        if remaining <= 0:
            return False
        if chosen in memo:
            return memo[chosen]

        for i in range(1, maxChoosableInteger + 1):
            current_mask = 1 << i
            if chosen & current_mask == 0:
                if not can_win(remaining - i, chosen | current_mask):
                    memo[chosen] = True
                    return True

        memo[chosen] = False
        return False

    return can_win(desiredTotal, 0)

# Example usage:
maxChoosableInteger = 10
desiredTotal = 11
print(canIWin(maxChoosableInteger, desiredTotal))  # Output: False
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution can be analyzed as follows:

1. **Bitmask States:** The total potential states we can have is `2^maxChoosableInteger`, which is `2^20` in the worst case.
2. **Recursive Calls:** Each call iterates over `maxChoosableInteger` choices.

Therefore, the time complexity is `O(2^n * n)`, where `n` is `maxChoosableInteger`.

The space complexity is primarily dictated by the memoization table holding up to `2^n` entries, making it `O(2^n)`.
