title:  Design Movie Rental System-out

You are tasked with designing a movie rental system. The system supports the following operations:

1. **Search for available movies by price**: Given a movie name, you should return a list of stores where the movie is available for rent in the order of their rental prices (in ascending order). If two stores have the same price, return the stores with smaller store IDs first.
2. **Rent a movie**: Rent a movie from a specific store. After renting, the movie becomes unavailable at that store.
3. **Drop off a movie**: Mark a movie as returned to a specific store.
4. **Report rented movies**: Return a list of rented movies sorted first by their rental prices (in ascending order), and then by store ID. If two movies have the same price, return the movie with the smaller movie ID first.

You need to implement the following interface:
```python
class MovieRentalSystem:

    def __init__(self, n, entries):
        pass

    def search(self, movie):
        pass

    def rent(self, store, movie):
        pass

    def drop(self, store, movie):
        pass

    def report(self):
        pass
```

- `MovieRentalSystem(int n, int[][] entries)` initializes the system with `n` entries. Each entry contains three integers `[store, movie, price]` representing a store that has a movie available for rent at a certain price.
- `List<int[]> search(String movie)` returns a list of stores where the movie is available for rent, sorted by price (ascending), and if prices are the same, by store ID (ascending).
- `void rent(int store, String movie)` rents a movie from a specific store.
- `void drop(int store, String movie)` marks a movie as returned to a specific store.
- `List<int[]> report()` returns a list of rented movies sorted by price, then by store ID, then by movie ID.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the movie names be assumed to be unique identifiers?
2. Are all.store IDs and movie IDs guaranteed to fit into a standard integer type?
3. What should be the result of searching for a movie that doesn't exist at any store?
4. Are there constraints on the sizes of input data?

Assuming typical constraints for competitive programming:

- 1 ≤ store ID, movie ID ≤ 100,000
- 1 ≤ price ≤ 1,000,000

## Strategy
1. **Data Structures**:
    - `available_movies`: A dictionary where key is the movie and value is a list of (price, store). This is used for quick look-up of which stores have a particular movie available.
    - `rented_movies`: A set of tuples (price, store, movie) for storing rented movies in a sorted manner to facilitate quick sorting and retrieval.
    - `inventory`: A dictionary of dictionaries where `inventory[store][movie]` maps to price. This helps in quickly managing the renting and dropping operations.

2. **Functions**:
    - **Search**: Retrieve and sort the list of stores for a given movie from `available_movies`.
    - **Rent**: Move a movie from `available_movies` to `rented_movies`.
    - **Drop**: Move a movie from `rented_movies` back to `available_movies`.
    - **Report**: Simply return the sorted list from `rented_movies`.

## Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import heapq

class MovieRentalSystem:

    def __init__(self, n, entries):
        self.available_movies = defaultdict(list)
        self.rented_movies = set()
        self.inventory = defaultdict(dict)
        
        for store, movie, price in entries:
            self.available_movies[movie].append((price, store))
            self.inventory[store][movie] = price
        
        for movie in self.available_movies:
            heapq.heapify(self.available_movies[movie])
    
    def search(self, movie):
        if movie not in self.available_movies:
            return []
        
        return sorted(self.available_movies[movie])[:5]
    
    def rent(self, store, movie):
        price = self.inventory[store][movie]
        
        self.available_movies[movie].remove((price, store))
        heapq.heapify(self.available_movies[movie])
        
        self.rented_movies.add((price, store, movie))
        del self.inventory[store][movie]
    
    def drop(self, store, movie):
        price = None
        
        for item in self.rented_movies:
            if item[1] == store and item[2] == movie:
                price = item[0]
                break
        
        if price is not None:
            self.rented_movies.remove((price, store, movie))
            heapq.heappush(self.available_movies[movie], (price, store))
            self.inventory[store][movie] = price
    
    def report(self):
        return sorted(list(self.rented_movies))[:5]
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Initialization (`__init__`)**: O(n log n) to build and heapify the entries.
2. **Search**: O(m log m) for sorting the list of stores, where m is the number of available stores for the movie.
3. **Rent**: O(m log m) for removing and heapifying the available movies.
4. **Drop**: O(log m) for adding back to the heap and managing the set.
5. **Report**: O(r log r) for sorting the rented movies, where r is the number of rented movies.

This design ensures efficiency for common operations with appropriate use of data structures.
