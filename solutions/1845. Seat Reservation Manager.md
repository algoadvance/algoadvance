title:  Seat Reservation Manager-out
permalink: /s1845
---
You are managing a reservation system for a convention center with a limited number of seats. The seat allocation is managed by a ticket system, ensuring that customers get the lowest-numbered available seat.

Implement the following functionalities in a class `SeatManager`:

1. `SeatManager(int n)`: Initializes a `SeatManager` object that will manage `n` seats numbered from 1 to `n`.
2. `int reserve()`: Reserves the lowest-numbered unreserved seat and returns its number.
3. `void unreserve(int seatNumber)`: Unreserves the seat with the given number.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the range of `n` specified or bounded by certain limits in any context?**
   - The number would typically be constrained only by practical application limits, such as memory or processing power.
  
2. **Can seats be reserved again after being unreserved?**
   - Yes, once a seat is unreserved, it can be reserved again.

3. **Is there any particular order in which the seats should be reallocated (e.g., FIFO)?**
   - Seats should always be reallocated in the order of their number, with the lowest available seat being reserved first.

### Strategy
1. Use a min-heap to efficiently manage seat reservations because a min-heap allows us to always access and remove the smallest element very quickly.
2. Initialize the heap with seat numbers from `1` to `n`.
3. When reserving a seat, extract the minimum element from the heap.
4. When unreserving a seat, insert the seat number back into the heap.

This approach guarantees that the seat management operations can be performed in logarithmic time.

### Code

```python
import heapq

class SeatManager:
    def __init__(self, n: int):
        # Initialize a min-heap with all seat numbers from 1 to n
        self.available_seats = list(range(1, n + 1))
        heapq.heapify(self.available_seats)

    def reserve(self) -> int:
        # Reserve the seat with the lowest number
        return heapq.heappop(self.available_seats)

    def unreserve(self, seatNumber: int) -> None:
        # Add the seat number back into the min-heap
        heapq.heappush(self.available_seats, seatNumber)

# Example usage:
# manager = SeatManager(5)
# seat1 = manager.reserve()  # seat1 should be 1
# seat2 = manager.reserve()  # seat2 should be 2
# manager.unreserve(1)
# seat3 = manager.reserve()  # seat3 should now be 1 again
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization**: `O(n)` to heapify the seat numbers.
- **Reserve**: `O(log n)` to pop the smallest element from the heap.
- **Unreserve**: `O(log n)` to push a seat number back into the heap.

This implementation ensures that all operations are efficient and suitable for handling a potentially large number of seats.
