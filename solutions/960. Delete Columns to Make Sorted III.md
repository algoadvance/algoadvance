title:  Delete Columns to Make Sorted III-out
permalink: /s960
---

Given an array of `n` strings `strs`, where each string of `strs` is of the same length, you can choose any deletion of columns (remove a set of columns) to create the largest possible array of sorted (non-decreasing) strings. Your goal is to find out the **minimum number of columns** that you need to delete to make the remaining columns sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Are all strings in the array `strs` of the same length?
   - What are the constraints on the length of the strings and the number of strings?

   *Yes, all strings in `strs` are of the same length.*

   Constraints:
   - `1 <= strs.length <= 100`
   - `1 <= strs[i].length <= 1000`
   - `strs[i]` will contain only lowercase English letters.

2. **Output:**
   - Do we need to output the minimum number of columns to be deleted as an integer?

   *Yes, we need to output the minimum number of columns to delete.*

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach inspired by the concept of the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS). Here's the plan:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table:**
   - Define a DP array `dp` where `dp[j]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence of columns ending at column `j`.
   - Initially, each column in isolation is a sorted sequence of length 1 (`dp[j] = 1` for all `j`).

2. **Filling the DP Table:**
   - For each pair of columns `i` and `j` (where `i < j`), check if `strs[k][i] <= strs[k][j]` for all strings `k` in the array `strs`.
   - If true, update `dp[j]` as `dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[i] + 1)`.

3. **Result Calculation:**
   - The minimum number of columns to delete is `len(columns) - max(dp)`.

### Code

Here is the Python implementation of the above strategy:

```python
def minDeletionSize(strs):
    n = len(strs[0])  # Length of each string (number of columns)
    dp = [1] * n  # Initialize the DP array with 1s
    
    # Process each pair of columns (i, j) where i < j
    for j in range(1, n):
        for i in range(j):
            # Check if column i <= column j for each string
            if all(strs[k][i] <= strs[k][j] for k in range(len(strs))):
                dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[i] + 1)

    # The number of deletions required = total columns - length of longest increasing subsequence
    return n - max(dp)

# Example usage:
strs = ["babca","bbazb"]
print(minDeletionSize(strs))  # Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** 
  - The outer loop runs for `n` columns.
  - The inner loop runs for `n` columns before the current column.
  - The `all` check compares `m` strings for each pair of columns.
  - Therefore, the time complexity is `O(n^2 * m)`, where `n` is the length of a string (number of columns) and `m` is the number of strings.

- **Space Complexity:** 
  - The space complexity is `O(n)` for the DP array.

This solution leverages dynamic programming to efficiently find the minimum number of column deletions required to make the remaining columns sorted.
