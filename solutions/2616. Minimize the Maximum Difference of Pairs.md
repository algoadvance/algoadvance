title:  Minimize the Maximum Difference of Pairs-out
permalink: /s2616
---

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `p`. You need to find a way to partition the array into `p` pairs such that the maximum difference between the maximum and minimum values of any pair is minimized.

Return the minimzied maximum difference.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the bounds on `nums` and `p`?**
   - `nums` can contain up to 1000 elements.
   - `1 <= p <= len(nums) // 2`

2. **What values can the elements in `nums` take?**
   - The elements can be any integer.

3. **Can the elements in `nums` be negative?**
   - Yes, the elements in `nums` can be both negative and positive integers.

4. **Do we need to use all the elements of `nums`?**
   - Yes, we need to use all the elements to partition them into `p` pairs.

5. **What if there are multiple optimal ways to partition the array?**
   - Any one of the optimal solutions is acceptable.

### Strategy

1. **Sorting**: First, sort the array `nums`. Since we need to minimize the maximum difference between pairs, sorting simplifies the problem as elements that are closer in value will be adjacent.

2. **Binary Search on Difference**: To find the minimized maximum difference, we can use binary search on the possible range of differences. The range will be from `0` (minimum possible difference) to `nums[-1] - nums[0]` (maximum possible difference after sorting).

3. **Greedy Validation Using Sliding Window**: For a fixed maximum difference `mid` (chosen by binary search), use a greedy approach to check if it's possible to partition the array into `p` pairs such that each pair has a difference of at most `mid`.

### Code

```python
def minimizeMaxDifference(nums, p):
    nums.sort()  # Step 1: Sort the array
    
    def canFormPairs(max_diff, nums, p):
        count = 0
        i = 1
        while i < len(nums):
            if nums[i] - nums[i - 1] <= max_diff:
                count += 1
                i += 2  # Found a pair, skip to next potential pair
            else:
                i += 1  # No pair found, check next element
            if count >= p:
                return True
        return False
    
    left, right = 0, nums[-1] - nums[0]
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if canFormPairs(mid, nums, p):
            right = mid  # Try for a smaller maximum difference
        else:
            left = mid + 1  # Increase the allowed difference

    return left
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting**: Sorting the array takes \(O(n \log n)\), where `n` is the length of `nums`.

2. **Binary Search**: The binary search on the difference range, in the worst case, runs in \(O(\log(\text{max\_num - min\_num})) = O(\log n)\) (since the difference can be at most the range covered by the numbers).

3. **Greedy Validation**: For each check, the greedy validation takes \(O(n)\) time.

Overall, the complexity is \(O(n \log n + n \log n) = O(n \log n)\).

This strategy effectively balances the need to explore various potential maximum differences while maintaining efficiency through sorting and binary search.
