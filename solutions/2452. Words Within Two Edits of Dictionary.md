title:  Words Within Two Edits of Dictionary-out
permalink: /s2452
---
You are given two lists `queries` and `dictionary`. Each element of these lists consists of lowercase English letters and all the strings in each list are of the same length.

A string in `queries` is considered to be within two edits of a string in `dictionary` if you can change at most two letters in the string in `queries` to make it equal to the string in `dictionary`.

Return a list `result` where `result[i]` is `True` if `queries[i]` is within two edits of some string in `dictionary`, otherwise `False`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Length Consistency**: Can we assume all strings in both `queries` and `dictionary` are of the same length, or do we need to handle cases where lengths vary?
   - We can assume all strings are of the same length, as stated in the prompt.

2. **Case Sensitivity**: Are the strings case-sensitive?
   - The problem states all strings consist of lowercase English letters, so no case sensitivity concerns are present.

3. **Output Format**: Is the desired output a list of booleans corresponding to each query?
   - Yes, the output should be a list with `True` or `False` for each query string depending on whether it is within two edits of any dictionary string.

### Strategy
1. For each string in `queries`, iterate through each string in `dictionary`.
2. For each pair of query and dictionary strings of the same length, compare characters one by one.
3. Count the number of differing characters between the query string and the dictionary string.
4. If the number of differing characters is 2 or less for any dictionary string, mark the query string as `True`. Otherwise, mark it as `False`.
5. Return the result list.

### Code

```python
def twoEdits(query, word):
    diff_count = 0
    for q_char, w_char in zip(query, word):
        if q_char != w_char:
            diff_count += 1
            if diff_count > 2:
                return False
    return True

def twoEditsWordsWithin(query, dictionary):
    result = []
    for query_str in query:
        is_within_two_edits = any(twoEdits(query_str, dict_str) for dict_str in dictionary)
        result.append(is_within_two_edits)
    return result

# Example usage
queries = ["word", "note", "wood"]
dictionary = ["wood", "mode", "road"]

print(twoEditsWordsWithin(queries, dictionary))
# Output: [True, True, True]
```

### Time Complexity
- The function `twoEdits` compares two strings of length `n` in `O(n)` time.
- For each query string (let's say we have `m` query strings), we compare it against each dictionary string (let's say there are `k` dictionary strings). This gives us an overall time complexity of `O(m * k * n)`:
  - `m`: Number of query strings
  - `k`: Number of dictionary strings
  - `n`: Length of each string

Given this complexity, our approach should efficiently handle reasonably sized inputs within typical constraints (e.g., a few hundred query and dictionary strings of length up to a few dozen characters).
