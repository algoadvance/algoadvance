title:  Integer Replacement-out
permalink: /s397
---
The problem requires you to write a function that takes a positive integer `n` and returns the minimum number of replacements needed for `n` to become 1. The replacements can be:
1. If `n` is even, replace `n` with `n / 2`.
2. If `n` is odd, you can replace `n` with either `n + 1` or `n - 1`.

### Clarifying Questions
To ensure full understanding of the problem, here are some clarifications:
1. **Input types**: Can we assume the input will always be a positive integer?
   - **Yes**, the problem guarantees that `n` is a positive integer.
2. **Output types**: Should the output always be an integer representing the minimum steps required?
   - **Yes**, the output should be a non-negative integer.

### Strategy
The problem can be approached using a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** for optimality since BFS finds the shortest path in an unweighted graph and in this case, we can think of each number as a graph node.

1. **Use BFS**:
   - Initialize a queue with the first element `(n, 0)` where `0` represents the current depth (number of steps taken).
   - Use a set to keep track of visited numbers to avoid cycles.
   - While the queue is not empty:
     - Dequeue the first element.
     - If the dequeued number is 1, return the steps taken so far.
     - If the number is even, enqueue `(number / 2, steps + 1)`.
     - If the number is odd, enqueue both `(number + 1, steps + 1)` and `(number - 1, steps + 1)` unless those values have been visited.
   - This ensures that we find the minimum steps to reach 1.

### Code
Here's the implementation of the explained strategy:

```python
from collections import deque

def integerReplacement(n: int) -> int:
    # Edge case, if already n is 1
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    
    queue = deque([(n, 0)])
    visited = set([n])
    
    while queue:
        current, steps = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == 1:
            return steps
        
        next_steps = steps + 1
        
        if current % 2 == 0:
            next_num = current // 2
            if next_num not in visited:
                visited.add(next_num)
                queue.append((next_num, next_steps))
        else:
            next_num1 = current + 1
            next_num2 = current - 1
            if next_num1 not in visited:
                visited.add(next_num1)
                queue.append((next_num1, next_steps))
            if next_num2 not in visited:
                visited.add(next_num2)
                queue.append((next_num2, next_steps))

```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this solution is **O(log n)**:
- In the worst case, each step either halves the number (for even numbers) or changes it by 1 (for odd numbers). This effectively reduces the search space logarithmically.

The space complexity is **O(log n)** as well due to the nature of the BFS kept in the queue and the visited set maintaining states of up to log n due to the halving steps.
