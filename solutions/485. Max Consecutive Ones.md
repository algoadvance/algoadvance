Given a binary array `nums`, return the maximum number of consecutive `1`s in the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on Length of Array**: What is the maximum length of the array?
   - The problem does not explicitly state this, but we can assume the array length can be quite large (up to \(10^5\) elements).

2. **Array Contents**: Can the array contain negative numbers or numbers other than 0 or 1?
   - No, the array is strictly binary, containing only 0s and 1s.

3. **Empty Array**: What should be the output if the array is empty?
   - If the array is empty, there are no consecutive ones, so the output should be 0.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Counters**: We'll use two variables: one to keep track of the current streak of consecutive 1s and another to store the maximum streak found.
2. **Iterate Through Array**: We'll loop through the array. For each element:
   - If it's 1, increment the current streak counter.
   - If it's 0, update the maximum streak if the current streak is greater and reset the current streak counter.
3. **Final Check**: After the loop, check the current streak one last time to update the maximum streak if needed.
4. **Result**: The maximum streak counter will hold our result.

### Code

```python
def findMaxConsecutiveOnes(nums):
    max_consecutive = 0
    current_streak = 0

    for num in nums:
        if num == 1:
            current_streak += 1
            max_consecutive = max(max_consecutive, current_streak)
        else:
            current_streak = 0

    return max_consecutive
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the array. This is because we iterate through the array once, performing constant-time operations for each element.

The space complexity is \( O(1) \) since we are using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
