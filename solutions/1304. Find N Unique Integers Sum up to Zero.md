title:  Find N Unique Integers Sum up to Zero-out
permalink: /s1304

1. Could you confirm that the input number \( N \) is always a positive integer?
2. Is there any constraint on the maximum value of \( N \)?

This information will help me determine any edge cases or constraints necessary for the solution.

## Strategy

To solve the problem of finding \( N \) unique integers that sum up to zero, we can exploit the properties of arithmetic sequences and symmetry. Here's the approach:

1. **Observation**:
    - For the sum of \( N \) integers to be zero, an easy way is to use negative and positive pairs of numbers, along with zero if \( N \) is odd.
    - For example, for \( N = 5 \), we can use \([-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]\).

2. **Approach**:
    - If \( N \) is even, simply generate pairs \([-N/2, -N/2 + 1, ..., -1, 1, ..., N/2 - 1, N/2]\).
    - If \( N \) is odd, do the same, and add zero into the list.

## Code

Here's the code to implement this strategy:

```python
def sumZero(N):
    result = []
    
    # If N is even or odd, the strategy works with the loop below
    for i in range(1, N // 2 + 1):
        result.append(i)
        result.append(-i)
    
    # If N is odd, add a zero
    if N % 2 != 0:
        result.append(0)
    
    return result
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \( O(N) \) because we are creating the list of \( N \) numbers and each insertion operation is \( O(1) \).

Let's run a few examples to see how the function performs:

- For \( N = 5 \):
  - Expected output: `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]`
  
- For \( N = 4 \):
  - Expected output: `[-2, -1, 1, 2]`
  
- For \( N = 3 \):
  - Expected output: `[-1, 0, 1]`

These examples should validate the correctness of the function.
