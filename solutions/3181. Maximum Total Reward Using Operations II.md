title:  Maximum Total Reward Using Operations II-out
permalink: /s3181
---
You are given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers and an integer `k`. You can perform the following operation at most `k` times: Remove any element from the array `nums` and add to your total reward twice that element's value (i.e., if you remove `x` from the array, your total reward increases by `2*x`).

Determine the maximum total reward you can achieve by performing this operation at most `k` times.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the array `nums` contain duplicate elements?
   **A:** Yes, the array `nums` can have duplicate elements.

2. **Q:** If `k` is greater than the length of `nums`, should we consider `k` as the length of `nums`?
   **A:** Yes, if `k` is greater than the length of `nums`, we will only be able to perform the operation up to the length of `nums`.

3. **Q:** What is the expected output if the array `nums` is empty?
   **A:** If `nums` is empty, the maximum total reward would be `0` since there are no elements to remove.

### Strategy
1. **Sort the Array:** Sort the array in descending order so that the largest elements come first.
2. **Select the Largest Elements:** Choose the first `k` (or up to the available elements if `k` is larger than the length) elements from the sorted array.
3. **Calculate the Total Reward:** Sum up twice the value of each chosen element to get the maximum possible reward.

### Code
```python
def max_total_reward(nums, k):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    
    # Sort the array in descending order
    nums.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Select up to `k` largest elements
    largest_elements = nums[:k]
    
    # Calculate the total reward
    total_reward = sum(2 * x for x in largest_elements)
    
    return total_reward

# Example usage
nums = [1, 3, 2, 4]
k = 2
print(max_total_reward(nums, k))  # Output should be 14
```

### Time Complexity
- Sorting the array will take \(O(n \log n)\) time where \(n\) is the length of the array.
- Slicing and generating the reward will take \(O(k)\), where \(k\) can be at most \(n\).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

### Explanation
1. **Sorting:** We sort `nums` in descending order so that the largest elements come first.
2. **Slicing:** We take the first `k` elements from the sorted array.
3. **Calculating Reward:** For each of the selected elements, we calculate twice its value and sum these values to get the maximum total reward possible. 

This algorithm ensures that we are always maximizing our reward by choosing the highest possible values from `nums`.
