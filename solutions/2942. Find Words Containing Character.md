title:  Find Words Containing Character-out
permalink: /s2942
---

You are given a list of strings `words` and a single character `ch`. Your task is to find and return all the strings in the list `words` that contain the character `ch`.

#### Example:

**Input:**
```plaintext
words = ["hello", "world", "leetcode"]
ch = 'o'
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
["hello", "world"]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Is the input list `words` guaranteed to be non-empty?
   **A**: Yes, you can assume the list `words` is non-empty.

2. **Q**: Can the character `ch` be a special character or a number?
   **A**: Yes, the character `ch` can be any valid character.

3. **Q**: What should be the case sensitivity for matching the character `ch` in the words?
   **A**: The matching should be case-sensitive, according to the given example.

4. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the length of the list `words` or on the length of individual words?
   **A**: The problem statement does not specify constraints, but we'll assume reasonable constraints suitable for typical coding challenges.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:** Create an empty list to hold the words that contain the character `ch`.
2. **Iteration:** Loop through each word in the list `words`.
3. **Containment Check:** For each word, check if the character `ch` is present in the word.
4. **Appending:** If the character `ch` is found in the word, append the word to the result list.
5. **Return the Result List:** After checking all words, return the list of words containing the character `ch`.

### Code

Hereâ€™s the Python code that implements the strategy described above:

```python
def find_words_containing_char(words, ch):
    # Result list to hold words containing the character `ch`
    result = []
    
    # Iterate over each word in the input list
    for word in words:
        if ch in word:
            result.append(word)
    
    return result

# Example usage:
words = ["hello", "world", "leetcode"]
ch = 'o'
print(find_words_containing_char(words, ch))
```

### Time Complexity

- **Iteration over the list:** We iterate through each word in the list `words`, which takes O(n) where `n` is the number of words.
- **Containment check for each word:** Checking if a character is in a word takes O(m) in the worst case, where `m` is the length of the word.

Combining these, the overall time complexity is O(n * m), where `n` is the number of words and `m` is the average length of the words.
