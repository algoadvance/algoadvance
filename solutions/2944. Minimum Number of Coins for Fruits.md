title:  Minimum Number of Coins for Fruits-out
permalink: /s2944
---

You are given a 2D list `coins` where `coins[i]` represents the number of coins needed to buy fruit `i` on day `j`. You can only buy one type of fruit each day. However, if you buy the same fruit on two consecutive days, you get a discount on the second day, which is represented by another 2D list `discount` where `discount[i][j]` represents the discount you'll get on the `j`-th day if you bought the same fruit on day `j-1`.

Your objective is to find the minimum number of coins needed to buy fruits for each day to cover all days.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can we buy any fruit on the first day?
   - Yes, you can buy any fruit on the first day without any restriction.
2. Do we need to consider edge cases such as no days or no fruits?
   - Assume `coins` and `discount` are non-empty and all parameters are valid.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - We use a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum coins needed to buy fruits up to the `i`-th day with the last fruit being `j`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - For the first day, `dp[0][j] = coins[0][j]` for all `j` because there are no previous days.

3. **State Transition:**
   - For each day `i`:
     - For each fruit `j`:
       - Calculate the minimum coins required by choosing each possible fruit `k` on the previous day and add the current cost. If `j == k`, apply the discount.
       - Thus, the relation will be:
         - `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][k] + coins[i][j] - discount[j][i] if k == j else dp[i-1][k] + coins[i][j])`
   - Finally, return the minimum value in the last row of the DP table.

4. **Time Complexity:**
   - The solution will have a time complexity of `O(n * m^2)`, where `n` is the number of days and `m` is the number of fruits.

### Code

```python
def minCoins(coins, discount):
    n = len(coins)  # number of days
    m = len(coins[0])  # number of fruits

    # Initialize the dp table
    dp = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]

    # Base case: first day
    for j in range(m):
        dp[0][j] = coins[0][j]

    # Fill the dp table
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(m):
            dp[i][j] = float('inf')
            for k in range(m):
                if j == k:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][k] + coins[i][j] - discount[j][i])
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][k] + coins[i][j])

    # Return the minimum value in the last row
    return min(dp[-1])

# Example usage:
coins = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [1, 2, 1],
    [2, 2, 2]
]

discount = [
    [0, 1, 1],
    [0, 1, 1],
    [0, 1, 1]
]

print(minCoins(coins, discount))  # Outputs the minimum number of coins needed
```

This code snippet defines the function `minCoins` which implements the above-discussed strategy using dynamic programming to calculate the minimum number of coins required by the given constraints.
