title:  Maximum Binary Tree II-out
permalink: /s998
---

You are given the root of a maximum binary tree and an integer `val`.

A maximum binary tree is a tree where every node has a value greater than any other value in its subtree, and a new maximum binary tree can be constructed using a given array `nums`. Given a maximum binary tree `root`, construct a new tree by inserting `val` into the tree such that it remains a maximum binary tree.

Return the root of the new maximum binary tree.

Example:
```
Input: root = [4,1,3,null,null,2], val = 5
Output: [5,4,null,1,3,null,null,2]

Input: root = [5,2,4,null,1], val = 3
Output: [5,2,4,null,1,null,3]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the structure of the input tree?**
   - The tree is given as a TreeNode structure where each node contains an integer value and two children (left and right).

2. **How is the tree encoded?**
   - The tree nodes are encoded in list form where `root = [4, 1, 3, null, null, 2]`. Each element represents a node value, and `null` signifies no child.

3. **What should be returned?**
   - The function should return the root of the new maximum binary tree after inserting `val`.

## Strategy

1. **Understanding the insertion rule:** 
   - If `val` is greater than the root value, `val` becomes the new root.
   - Otherwise, traverse the tree to the right and insert it in a position similar to how elements are inserted in a binary search tree.

2. **Edge cases:**
   - Empty tree (i.e., `root` is `None`): Simply return a new node with `val`.
   - If `val` becomes the new root.

## Code

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def insertIntoMaxTree(root: TreeNode, val: int) -> TreeNode:
    new_node = TreeNode(val)
    if not root:
        return new_node
        
    # If the new value is greater than the root, the new node becomes the root
    if root.val < val:
        new_node.left = root
        return new_node
    
    current = root
    while current.right:
        if current.right.val < val:
            new_node.left = current.right
            current.right = new_node
            return root
        current = current.right
        
    # If we reach here, it means we have reached the rightmost node
    current.right = new_node
    return root
```

## Time Complexity

- **Best Case**: O(1) if the new value becomes the new root.
- **Average Case & Worst Case**: O(h) where `h` is the height of the tree. In the worst case, we might traverse from the root to the rightmost leaf node.

Thus, the function is efficient and fits within typical constraints for binary tree operations.
