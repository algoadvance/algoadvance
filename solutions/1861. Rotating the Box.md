title:  Rotating the Box-out
permalink: /s1861
---

You are given an `m x n` matrix of characters `box` representing a side-view of a box. Each cell is one of the following:

- A stone `'#'`
- A stationary obstacle `'*'`
- Empty `'.'`

The box is rotated 90 degrees clockwise and then the stones gravity affects them.

Return the box after the rotation.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Gravity Impact**: After rotation, stones (`'#'`) move downward until they hit either the floor of the box or an obstacle (`'*'`).
2. **Dimensions Guarantee**: Can we assume that the provided matrix dimensions `m` and `n` are valid?
3. **Edge Cases**: Should we consider any edge cases like very small boxes (e.g., `1x1`), or boxes with no stones or only obstacles?

### Code

```python
from typing import List

def rotateTheBox(box: List[List[str]]) -> List[List[str]]:
    m, n = len(box), len(box[0])
    
    # Applying gravity on each row of the box first
    for i in range(m):
        empty_slot = n - 1
        for j in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            if box[i][j] == '#':
                if empty_slot != j:
                    box[i][empty_slot], box[i][j] = box[i][j], box[i][empty_slot]
                empty_slot -= 1
            elif box[i][j] == '*':
                empty_slot = j - 1
    
    # Creating the rotated box after gravity
    rotated_box = [['']*m for _ in range(n)]
    
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            rotated_box[j][m-1-i] = box[i][j]
    
    return rotated_box

# Example input
box = [
    ['#', '.', '*', '.'],
    ['#', '#', '*', '.']
]

print(rotateTheBox(box))
```

### Strategy

1. **Simulating Gravity**:
   - Iterate through each row from right to left.
   - Track the position of the last found empty slot.
   - Move each stone (`'#'`) to the farthest `'.'` position available and update the empty slot position.
   - Reset the empty slot position whenever an obstacle (`'*'`) is encountered.

2. **Rotating the Box**:
   - Create a new matrix of size `n x m`.
   - Map each element from the original box to its position in the new, rotated matrix:
     - Element originally at `(i, j)` should move to `(j, m - 1 - i)` in the rotated box.
   - Return the new rotated and gravity-affected box.

### Time Complexity

- **Gravity Simulation**: Each cell is visited once for a total of \(O(m \times n)\).
- **Rotation**: Each cell is re-mapped once with \(O(m \times n)\).
- **Overall Time Complexity**:
  - The algorithm runs in \(O(m \times n)\) where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the box.

The provided solution efficiently handles the gravity adjustment before performing a 90-degree clockwise rotation, adhering to the problem constraints effectively.
