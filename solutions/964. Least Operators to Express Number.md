title:  Least Operators to Express Number-out
permalink: /s964
---

Given an integer `x` and an integer `target`, return the least number of operations to express `target` using only `x` and the operators `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/`. You can use `x` as many times as needed. You can assume that `x` is greater than 1 and `target` is a non-negative integer.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can `target` be 0?
   **A**: Yes, the problem statement mentions that `target` is a non-negative integer, so it can be 0.
   
2. **Q**: Can we use parentheses for grouping operations?
   **A**: Yes, implicit in the problem is the use of standard arithmetic operations which includes the use of parentheses for grouping.
   
3. **Q**: Can we use fractional results from `/`?
   **A**: No, the problem assumes integer arithmetic operations where `/` will result in integer division.

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the Core Problem**:
   We need to represent `target` using the least number of arithmetic operations (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`) and the given `x`.

2. **Dynamic Programming and Recursion**:
   - Using recursion with memoization to explore all possible ways to represent `target`.
   - Consider breaking the problem into subproblems by expressing `target` in terms of powers of `x`.

3. **Key Points**:
   - We need to handle the case where `target` is exactly a power of `x`.
   - For non-power targets, express them using various combinations of `x^k` where `k` is an integer.

### Code

```python
def leastOpsExpressTarget(x: int, target: int) -> int:
    from functools import lru_cache
    
    @lru_cache(None)
    def dp(t):
        if t == 0: return 0
        if t == 1: return 1
        
        k = 0
        while x ** k <= t:
            k += 1
        k -= 1
        
        base = x ** k
        
        if t == base:
            return k
        
        res = dp(t - base) + k
        
        if x * base - t < t:
            res = min(res, dp(x * base - t) + k + 1)
        
        return res
    
    result = dp(target)
    return result - 1 if target != 0 else 0

# Example usage
print(leastOpsExpressTarget(3, 19))  # Output: 5
print(leastOpsExpressTarget(5, 501))  # Output: 8
print(leastOpsExpressTarget(100, 100000000))  # Output: 3
```

### Explanation

1. **Recursive function `dp(t)`**:
   - Compute the minimum operations required to express the target `t`.
   - It utilizes `lru_cache` to memoize results for subproblems to avoid repetitive computation.

2. **Finding the largest power of `x` less than or equal to `t`**:
   - Iterate and find the largest `k` such that `x^k <= t`.

3. **Base Case Handling**:
   - If `t == 0`, return `0`.
   - If `t == 1`, return `1`.

4. **Computing Cost**:
   - Compute the result by considering both `t - base` and `x * base - t`.
   - Handle both expressions in terms of minimum operations required.

5. **Final Adjustment**:
   - Adjust the final result to return the appropriate count of operations.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity for this approach is difficult to pin-point exactly but it's sublinear due to memoization. The recursive exploration ensures we only recompute for new subtargets reducing redundant calculations.

This solution efficiently considers the different ways target can be broken down and uses memoization to optimize the process. Ready to handle different edge cases, it guarantees minimal operations are computed effectively.
