title:  House Robber III-out
permalink: /s337
---

The problem "House Robber III" can be found on LeetCode:

The thief has found himself a new place for his thievery again. There is only one entrance to this area, called `root`.

Besides the `root`, each house has one and only one parent house. After a tour, the smart thief realized that all houses in this place form a binary tree. It will automatically contact the police if two directly-linked houses were broken into on the same night.

Given the `root` of the binary tree, return the maximum amount of money the thief can rob without alerting the police.

Example:
```
Input: [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
     3
    / \
   2   3
    \   \ 
     3   1
Output: 7
Explanation: Maximum amount of money the thief can rob = 3 + 3 + 1 = 7.
```
### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Is it guaranteed that the input will always be a valid binary tree?
   - Are the values of nodes non-negative integers?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should be returned if the tree is empty?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach with memoization to enhance the performance:

1. **Recursive Helper Function:**
   - Define a helper function that returns two values:
     - The maximum amount of money we can rob including the current node.
     - The maximum amount of money we can rob excluding the current node.

2. **Recursive Cases:**
   - If we include the current node, we cannot include its immediate children, but we can include the grandchildren.
   - If we exclude the current node, we can freely consider the children nodes.

3. **Memoization:**
   - To avoid recomputation, use a dictionary to store the results of subproblems (values for each node).

### Code

Here's a Python implementation of the strategy described:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def rob(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        def helper(node):
            if not node:
                return (0, 0)
            
            # Post-order traversal to solve the problem bottom-up
            left = helper(node.left)
            right = helper(node.right)
            
            # If we rob the current node, we cannot rob its direct children
            rob_current = node.val + left[1] + right[1]
            
            # Otherwise, we take the max of robbing or not robbing each child
            not_rob_current = max(left) + max(right)
            
            return (rob_current, not_rob_current)
        
        # Calculate the maximum money that can be robbed starting from root
        return max(helper(root))

# Example Usage
# Construct the example tree [3,2,3,null,3,null,1]
root = TreeNode(3)
root.left = TreeNode(2)
root.right = TreeNode(3)
root.left.right = TreeNode(3)
root.right.right = TreeNode(1)

solution = Solution()
print(solution.rob(root))  # Output: 7
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the binary tree due to the recursion stack in the worst case (e.g., in a skewed tree).

This solution efficiently calculates the maximum amount of money that can be robbed following the given constraints.
