Given two positive integers `a` and a large positive integer array `b` representing an integer b containing digits from `b[0]` to `b[n-1]` (i.e., `b` is expressed as an array). Calculate `a` raised to the power `b mod 1337`. 

Essentially, the task is to compute \(a^{b} \mod 1337\), where \(b\) is a large number represented by an integer array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is `a` always a positive integer?**
    - Yes, `a` is always a positive integer.

2. **What is the range of elements in the array `b`?**
    - The elements of `b` are digits, so each element is between 0 and 9.

3. **Can the array `b` be large (e.g., tens of thousands of elements)?**
    - Yes, the array `b` can be very large, which is why directly computing the power is not feasible.

4. **What should be the output if `a` or `b` is zero?**
    - If `a` is 0 and `b` is not zero, the answer should be 0 (i.e., `0^b = 0` for any `b != 0`). If `b` is zero, `a ^ b` should be 1 (i.e., `a^0 = 1` for any `a != 0`).

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently:

1. **Modular Arithmetic**:
    - Use properties of modular arithmetic to simplify the calculation, especially due to a large `b`.
    - One of the properties we will use is \((a \cdot b) \mod c = [(a \mod c) \cdot (b \mod c)] \mod c\).

2. **Exponentiation by Squaring**:
    - Use this method to efficiently calculate large powers modulo a number.

3. **Handling the Large Exponent**:
    - Given `b` is an array, e.g., [1, 2, 3], it represents the number 123.
    - We will use the property \(a^{(b \cdot 10 + c)} \equiv a^b \cdot a^c \mod \text{mod}\) to incrementally compute the result.

4. **Python Function**:
    - Implement the solution where we decompose \(a^b \mod 1337\) using the above properties.

### Code

Let's implement the solution:

```python
def superPow(a, b):
    MOD = 1337

    # Helper function to compute (x ^ y) % mod using iterative squaring
    def power_mod(x, y, mod):
        result = 1
        x = x % mod  # Update x if it is more than or equal to mod
        while y > 0:
            if y % 2 == 1:  # If y is odd, multiply x with result
                result = (result * x) % mod
            y = y >> 1  # y = y // 2
            x = (x * x) % mod  # Change x to x^2
        return result

    # Reduce problem using the properties of modulus
    a %= MOD
    result = 1

    for digit in b:
        result = power_mod(result, 10, MOD) * power_mod(a, digit, MOD) % MOD

    return result

# Example usage:
a = 2
b = [1, 0]
print(superPow(a, b))  # Output: 1024
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n * log(10)), where `n` is the number of digits in the array `b` and `log(10)` arises from the power_mod function.

### Explanation

1. **power_mod Function**: 
    - Computes \((x^y) \mod \text{mod}\) using exponentiation by squaring, an efficient method for large powers.
    
2. **Iterate Over Array `b`**:
    - For each digit in `b`, adjust the current power result using the previous result taken to the power of 10 (because each new digit represents the next power of 10).
