title:  Range Sum Query - Immutable-out
permalink: /s303
---

The problem "303. Range Sum Query - Immutable" on LeetCode is defined as follows:

Given an integer array `nums`, implement the `NumArray` class:

- `NumArray(int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the integer array `nums`.
- `int sumRange(int left, int right)` Returns the sum of the elements of `nums` between indices `left` and `right` inclusive (i.e., `nums[left] + nums[left + 1] + ... + nums[right]`).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Can the `nums` array be empty?**
   - A: Yes, an empty array is a valid input.
 
2. **Q: What are the constraints on the integer values in the array?**
   - A: The integer values are within the range of `-10^5` to `10^5`.

3. **Q: What is the size range of the `nums` array?**
   - A: The array length can be from 0 to `10^4`.

4. **Q: How frequently will the `sumRange` queries be called?**
   - A: The frequency isnâ€™t specified, but we should optimize for multiple calls.

### Strategy

Given that the array is immutable and we need to support multiple `sumRange` queries efficiently, we should use a preprocessing approach to create a prefix sum array. This approach will allow us to answer each range sum query in constant time \(O(1)\).

**Steps:**

1. **Preprocessing:**
   - Build a prefix sum array where `prefix[i]` is the sum of the elements from `nums[0]` to `nums[i-1]` (with `prefix[0] = 0`).
   - This allows us to compute any range sum `sumRange(left, right)` as `prefix[right + 1] - prefix[left]`.

2. **Query:**
   - For each `sumRange(left, right)` query, use the precomputed prefix sums to get the result in constant time.

### Code

```python
class NumArray:

    def __init__(self, nums: List[int]):
        self.nums = nums
        self.prefix_sums = [0] * (len(nums) + 1)
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            self.prefix_sums[i + 1] = self.prefix_sums[i] + nums[i]

    def sumRange(self, left: int, right: int) -> int:
        return self.prefix_sums[right + 1] - self.prefix_sums[left]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing Time:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input array `nums`. This is for building the prefix sum array.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\), for storing the prefix sums.
- **Query Time:** \(O(1)\) per query, since each `sumRange` operation is computed using the prefix sums in constant time.

This solution efficiently preprocesses the data to allow each range sum query to be answered in constant time, leveraging extra space for the prefix sum array.
