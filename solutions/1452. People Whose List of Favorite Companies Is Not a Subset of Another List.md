title:  People Whose List of Favorite Companies Is Not a Subset of Another List-out
permalink: /s1452

Given the array `favoriteCompanies` where `favoriteCompanies[i]` is the list of favorites companies for the `i`-th person (indexed from 0), return the indices of people whose list of favorite companies is not a subset of any other list of favorite companies. You must return the indices in increasing order.

#### Example:
- Input: `favoriteCompanies = [["leetcode","google","facebook"],["google","microsoft"],["google","facebook"],["google"],["amazon"]]`
- Output: `[0,1,4]`

#### Constraints:
- `1 <= favoriteCompanies.length <= 100`
- `1 <= favoriteCompanies[i].length <= 500`
- `1 <= favoriteCompanies[i][j].length <= 20`
- All strings in favoriteCompanies[i] are distinct.
- All lists of favorite companies are distinct.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can two persons have the exact same list of favorite companies?
   - No, since all lists are distinct as per the problem constraints.
   
2. Do we need to handle empty lists of favorite companies?
   - It isn’t required since each person has at least one favorite company (as per constraints).

### Strategy:
1. We need to determine if the list of favorite companies for any person is a subset of another person's list.
2. Use sets to quickly check for subset relationships.
3. Compare each person's list with every other person's list to see if it’s a subset.
4. Collect indices that are not subsets of any other list.
5. Return the indices sorted in increasing order.

### Code:
```python
def peopleIndexes(favoriteCompanies):
    # Convert lists of favorite companies into sets for easy subset checking
    favoriteSets = [set(companies) for companies in favoriteCompanies]
    res = []
    
    for i in range(len(favoriteCompanies)):
        isSubset = False
        for j in range(len(favoriteCompanies)):
            if i != j and favoriteSets[i].issubset(favoriteSets[j]):
                isSubset = True
                break
        
        if not isSubset:
            res.append(i)
    
    return sorted(res)

# Example test
favoriteCompanies = [["leetcode","google","facebook"],["google","microsoft"],["google","facebook"],["google"],["amazon"]]
print(peopleIndexes(favoriteCompanies))  # Output: [0, 1, 4]
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Converting lists to sets:** `O(n * m)`, where `n` is the number of people and `m` is the average number of companies per list.
- **Checking subsets:** `O(n^2 * m)`, where the nested loops run `n^2` times and subset check (`issubset()`) takes at most `O(m)`.
- **Sorting result indices:** `O(n log n)`.

Combining these, the overall time complexity is `O(n^2 * m)`, which is manageable for `n ≤ 100`.

This solution comprehensively covers the requirements and manages potential edge cases within given constraints.
