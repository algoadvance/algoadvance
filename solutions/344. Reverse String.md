title:  Reverse String-out

The task is to write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the length range of the input array `s`?
     - It can be up to 10^5 characters.
   - What types of characters can be in the array?
     - The array can contain any printable ASCII characters.

2. **Function Signature:**
   - The function signature is defined as: `def reverseString(s: List[str]) -> None:`
   - It does not return anything; the input array should be modified in-place.

### Strategy

To reverse the string in-place with O(1) extra space:
1. Use the two-pointer technique:
   - Initialize one pointer at the start (left) and the other at the end (right) of the array.
   - Swap the elements at these pointers.
   - Move both pointers toward the center (increment the left pointer and decrement the right pointer).
   - Continue this process until the pointers meet or cross each other.

### Code

Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
from typing import List

def reverseString(s: List[str]) -> None:
    left, right = 0, len(s) - 1
    while left < right:
        # Swap characters
        s[left], s[right] = s[right], s[left]
        # Move pointers
        left, right = left + 1, right - 1
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - We traverse the string only once, swapping elements in place.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - No extra space is used; the reversal is done in-place.

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Set `left` pointer to the start (0th index).
   - Set `right` pointer to the end (last index).

2. **Swapping Elements:**
   - Swap the elements at positions `left` and `right`.
   - Increment `left` and decrement `right`.

3. **Termination:**
   - The loop terminates when `left` is no longer less than `right`.

### Example Walkthrough:

Consider `s = ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]`:

1. Initial state:
   ```
   left = 0, right = 4
   ["h", "e", "l", "l", "o"]
   ```

2. First iteration:
   ```
   Swap s[0] and s[4]:
   ["o", "e", "l", "l", "h"]
   Move pointers: left = 1, right = 3
   ```

3. Second iteration:
   ```
   Swap s[1] and s[3]:
   ["o", "l", "l", "e", "h"]
   Move pointers: left = 2, right = 2
   ```

4. End condition:
   ```
   Since left is not less than right, stop
   Final state: ["o", "l", "l", "e", "h"]
   ```

The elements are now reversed in-place.
