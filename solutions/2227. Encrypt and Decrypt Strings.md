title:  Encrypt and Decrypt Strings-out
permalink: /s2227
---

You are tasked with encrypting and decrypting strings. Specifically, the problem defines an encryption and decryption scheme as follows:

- `encrypt(word1: str, n: int) -> str`: Encrypt `word1` using a positional shift defined by the integer `n`. Each character in `word1` is shifted to the right in the alphabet by `n` positions. If the shift passes 'z', it wraps around to 'a'.
- `decrypt(word2: str, n: int) -> str`: Decrypt `word2` back to the original string by reversing the positional shift defined by `n`.

For example:
- `encrypt("abc", 3)` returns `"def"`
- `decrypt("def", 3)` returns `"abc"`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Character Limits**
   - Are the inputs always lowercase alphabets or can they include punctuation, digits, or uppercase letters?
   - Are there any constraints on the length of the input strings (`word1` and `word2`)?

2. **Shift Constraints**
   - Is `n` guaranteed to be a non-negative integer?
   - Can `n` be larger than 25, requiring multiple wraps around the alphabet?

3. **Efficiency Requirements**
   - Are there any performance guarantees or maximum input sizes that we need to consider?

### Strategy

1. **Understanding Shift in Alphabet**:
    - Encrypt: For each character in `word1`, calculate the new character by shifting it `n` positions forward in the alphabet.
    - Decrypt: For each character in `word2`, calculate the original character by shifting it `n` positions backward.

2. **Implementation Details**:
    - Use the ASCII values of characters to compute the new characters.
    - Use modular arithmetic to handle wrap arounds.

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - Handle input where `n` is very large by using `n % 26` to optimize unnecessary full cycle shifts.
    - Ensure input contains only lowercase letters or otherwise handle invalid characters appropriately.

### Code

```python
def encrypt(word1: str, n: int) -> str:
    result = []
    shift = n % 26
    for char in word1:
        if 'a' <= char <= 'z':
            new_char = chr((ord(char) - ord('a') + shift) % 26 + ord('a'))
            result.append(new_char)
        else:
            result.append(char)  # If we are not supposed to handle non lowercase alphabet
    return ''.join(result)

def decrypt(word2: str, n: int) -> str:
    result = []
    shift = n % 26
    for char in word2:
        if 'a' <= char <= 'z':
            new_char = chr((ord(char) - ord('a') - shift) % 26 + ord('a'))
            result.append(new_char)
        else:
            result.append(char)  # If we are not supposed to handle non lowercase alphabet
    return ''.join(result)
```

### Time Complexity

- **Encrypt Function**: The time complexity is \( O(m) \), where \( m \) is the length of `word1`. This is because we process each character exactly once.
- **Decrypt Function**: Similarly, the time complexity is \( O(m) \), where \( m \) is the length of `word2`.

These solutions perform efficiently for typical input sizes that you might encounter in competitive programming or real-world applications.
