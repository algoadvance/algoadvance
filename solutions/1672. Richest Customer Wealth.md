title:  Richest Customer Wealth-out
permalink: /s1672
---

You are given an `m x n` integer grid `accounts` where `accounts[i][j]` is the amount of money the `i-th` customer has in the `j-th` bank. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.

A customer's wealth is the sum of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

**Example 1:**
```python
Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.
```

**Example 2:**
```python
Input: accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]
Output: 10
Explanation: 
1st customer has wealth = 1 + 5 = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 7 + 3 = 10
3rd customer has wealth = 3 + 5 = 8
The richest customer is the 2nd customer with a wealth of 10.
```

**Example 3:**
```python
Input: accounts = [[2,8,7],[7,1,3],[1,9,5]]
Output: 17
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What constraints should be considered?**
   - The length of `accounts` and the length of each subarray can vary, typically within common input sizes for coding challenges.
   
2. **Can the values in `accounts` be negative?**
   - Based on problem context, all values are non-negative integers as they represent amounts of money.
   
3. **Are there any performance constraints?**
   - Standard efficient algorithms for finding maximum values and summing arrays should be sufficient.

### Strategy

1. Iterate through each customer in the `accounts` list.
2. For each customer, calculate the sum of all amounts in their accounts.
3. Keep track of the maximum sum encountered.
4. Return the maximum sum found.

### Code

Here is the Python implementation of the solution:

```python
def maximumWealth(accounts):
    max_wealth = 0
    
    for customer in accounts:
        customer_wealth = sum(customer)
        if customer_wealth > max_wealth:
            max_wealth = customer_wealth
    
    return max_wealth
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(m * n)**, where `m` is the number of customers and `n` is the number of accounts per customer.
  - We need to iterate through each customer (`m` iterations).
  - For each customer, summing their wealth involves iterating through `n` accounts.

- The space complexity is **O(1)**, as we are using a constant amount of extra space, only storing the maximum wealth found.

This implementation is efficient and straightforward, suitable for the problem constraints typically encountered in coding interviews.
