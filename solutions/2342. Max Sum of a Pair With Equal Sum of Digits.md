title:  Max Sum of a Pair With Equal Sum of Digits-out
permalink: /s2342
---

You are given a 0-indexed array `nums` consisting of non-negative integers. You need to determine the maximum sum of a pair of numbers from the array such that the sum of the digits of the numbers in the pair is the same. If no such pair exists, return -1.

Example:
```
Input: nums = [51,71,17,42]
Output: 93
Explanation:
- Pair (51, 42): Sum of digits of 51 is 6, and sum of digits of 42 is 6. Their sum is 93.
- Pair (71, 17): Sum of digits of 71 is 8, and sum of digits of 17 is 8. Their sum is 88.
So the maximum sum of a pair with equal digit sums is 93.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the numbers in the `nums` array?**
   - The problem guarantees that the array consists of non-negative integers.

2. **What is the size range of the `nums` array?**
   - This should be considered to optimize the solution.

3. **Should we account for pairs with the same indices?**
   - No, pairs should consist of different indices.

### Strategy

1. **Calculate the Sum of Digits**: Create a helper function to compute the sum of digits of a number.
2. **Track Max Values for Sums**: Use a dictionary to keep track of the two largest numbers for each unique sum of digits encountered in `nums`.
3. **Compute Pairs**:
   - For each unique sum of digits, if there are at least two numbers, calculate their sum and keep track of the maximum sum observed.
4. **Return Result**:
   - If no valid pairs are found, return -1.
   - Otherwise, return the maximum sum.

### Code

```python
def sum_of_digits(num):
    """Helper function to return the sum of digits of a number."""
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(num))

def max_sum_of_pair(nums):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Dictionary to track the largest two numbers per sum of digits
    digit_sum_map = defaultdict(list)
    
    for num in nums:
        digit_sum = sum_of_digits(num)
        digit_sum_map[digit_sum].append(num)
        
    max_sum = -1
    
    # Iterate through the digit_sum_map and find the maximum pairs sums
    for num_list in digit_sum_map.values():
        if len(num_list) > 1:
            num_list.sort(reverse=True)
            current_sum = num_list[0] + num_list[1]
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
    
    return max_sum

# Example use case
nums = [51, 71, 17, 42]
print(max_sum_of_pair(nums))  # Output: 93
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Calculating the sum of digits for each number: O(N * M), where N is the length of `nums` and M is the number of digits in the largest number.
  - Sorting lists within the dictionary: O(N log N) in the worst case, if all numbers have the exact same sum of digits.
  - Overall: Since each number is only processed a couple of times, this efficiently runs in O(N * M + N log N).

- **Space Complexity**:
  - Storing sums in the dictionary and lists: O(N) in the worst case scenario.
