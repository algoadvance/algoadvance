title:  Count Special Quadruplets-out
permalink: /s1995
---

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, return the number of **distinct** quadruplets `(a, b, c, d)` such that:
- `nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] == nums[d]`, and
- `0 <= a, b, c, d < nums.length`, and
- `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are distinct.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the size of the array `nums`?**
   - Typically, constraints will be provided in the problem description. But for this exercise, we'll assume practical limits.

2. **Can the solution have more time complexity than O(n^4)?**
   - We strive for a more efficient solution, but initially focusing on a basic O(n^4) approach might be helpful to establish correctness.

3. **Are the integers in the array `nums` bounded in any specific range?**
   - We can assume typical constraints found in coding challenges, e.g., integers within `(-10^6, 10^6)`.

### Strategy

1. **Brute Force Approach:** 
   - Iterate over all possible quadruplets `(a, b, c, d)` ensuring they are distinct indices.
   - Check if `nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] == nums[d]`.

2. **Optimized Approach:**
   - To reduce the complexity, we can use a hashmap to store sums of pairs and then check if there exists another pair that forms the required quadruplet.

### Implementation

#### Brute Force Approach (O(n^4))

```python
def countQuadruplets(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    count = 0
    for a in range(n):
        for b in range(a+1, n):
            for c in range(b+1, n):
                for d in range(c+1, n):
                    if nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] == nums[d]:
                        count += 1
    return count
```

This approach is straightforward but not efficient for larger arrays.

#### Optimized Approach using Hashmap (O(n^3))

Here is a more optimized approach using a hashmap to store sums of pairs:

```python
def countQuadruplets(nums):
    count = 0
    n = len(nums)
    for i in range(n-3):
        sum_map = {}
        for j in range(i+1, n-1):
            for k in range(j+1, n):
                sum_map[nums[i] + nums[j]] = sum_map.get(nums[i] + nums[j], 0) + 1
            
            for l in range(j+1, n):
                if nums[l] in sum_map:
                    count += sum_map[nums[l]]

    return count
```

### Time Complexity

The brute force approach has a time complexity of \(O(n^4)\).

The optimized approach reduces this to \(O(n^3)\):
- The outer loop iterates \(O(n)\).
- For each possible value of `i`, the inner two loops iterate \(O(n^2)\) to fill the hashmap and check values.

In terms of space complexity:
- The hashmap can store up to \(O(n^2)\) sums, making it \(O(n^2)\) in the worst-case scenario.

This optimized approach is more practical for larger inputs while ensuring correctness.
