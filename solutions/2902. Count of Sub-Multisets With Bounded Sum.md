title:  Count of Sub-Multisets With Bounded Sum-out
permalink: /s2902
---

Given an array of positive integers `nums` and an integer `k`, you are to find the count of different sub-multisets (i.e., subsets where elements can be repeated but are taken from the original array) such that the sum of the elements in each sub-multiset is exactly equal to `k`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are there constraints on the size of the input array or the value of `k`?**
   - Typical constraints on array sizes and values will help in determining the feasibility of certain approaches.
2. **Can the elements in the array be used repeatedly in constructing the sub-multisets?**
   - Yes, the elements can be repeatedly used.
3. **Is there a maximum length for the elements of the sub-multisets?**
   - No explicit maximum length is provided; we just need to ensure the sum matches `k`.

### Strategy

We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently. We will derive a solution based on the following key points:
- **Dynamic Programming (DP) Array**: We'll create a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` indicates the number of different sub-multisets with the sum exactly equal to `i`.
- **Transition**: For each element in `nums` and each possible sum `j` from `k` down to the element's value, we update the DP array.
- **Initialization**: Start with `dp[0] = 1` since there is exactly one way to make the sum 0 (using the empty subset).

### Time Complexity
- Since we iterate through each element in `nums` and for each element, we iterate backward through possible sums up to `k`, the time complexity is \(O(n \times k)\), where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`.

### Code
```python
def count_sub_multisets(nums, k):
    dp = [0] * (k + 1)
    dp[0] = 1  # One way to form the sum 0 (empty sub-multiset)

    for num in nums:
        for j in range(num, k + 1):
            dp[j] += dp[j - num]

    return dp[k]

# Example Usage
nums = [1, 2, 3]
k = 4
print(count_sub_multisets(nums, k))  # Output should be the count of sub-multisets summing to k
```

This approach efficiently captures all possible sub-multisets of the given sum using dynamic programming, ensuring optimal time complexity.
