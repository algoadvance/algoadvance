title:  Partition to K Equal Sum Subsets-out
permalink: /s698
---

The problem on LeetCode is as follows:

Given an array of integers `nums` and a positive integer `k`, return `true` if it is possible to divide this array into `k` non-empty subsets whose sums are all equal.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size of the input array?**
   - This could affect the choice of the algorithm due to time complexity constraints.
   - Answer: The size of the array `nums` can be between 1 and 16.

2. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - It influences how we approach the sums and subsets.
   - Answer: No, the array contains only positive integers.

3. **What if the total sum of the array elements is not exactly divisible by `k`?**
   - This is a preliminary check before diving into more complex logic.
   - Answer: In such cases, it's impossible to partition the array as specified, so the result should be `false`.

4. **Is it guaranteed that `k` is always a valid integer between 1 and the length of the array?**
   - This impacts initial validation.
   - Answer: Yes, `k` is always valid.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Validation**:
   - Compute the sum of the array. If this sum is not divisible by `k`, return `false`.

2. **Target Subset Sum**:
   - If divisible, each subset should sum to `total_sum // k`.

3. **Backtracking with Memoization**:
   - Use backtracking to try and form the required subsets.
   - Use a target sum for each subset and try to fill each subset while marking elements as used.
   - Use memoization to store states that have already been computed to avoid redundant work.

### Code

```python
def canPartitionKSubsets(nums, k):
    total_sum = sum(nums)
    
    # If the total sum is not divisible by k, return False
    if total_sum % k != 0:
        return False
        
    target_sum = total_sum // k
    nums.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Optimization: if the largest number is greater than the target subset sum, we can't partition
    if nums[0] > target_sum:
        return False
    
    # Memoization and backtracking setup
    used = [False] * len(nums)
    
    def backtrack(start, k, current_sum):
        # Base case: if only one subset left, it will have the correct sum
        if k == 0:
            return True
        # Base case: if current subset's sum is achieved, start new subset
        if current_sum == target_sum:
            return backtrack(0, k - 1, 0)
        
        # Try to fill the current subset
        for i in range(start, len(nums)):
            if not used[i] and current_sum + nums[i] <= target_sum:
                used[i] = True
                if backtrack(i + 1, k, current_sum + nums[i]):
                    return True
                used[i] = False   # backtrack
        
        return False
    
    return backtrack(0, k, 0)
```

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the array takes `O(n log n)` where `n` is the length of the array.
- The backtracking part, in the worst case, examines all subsets and combinations, leading to a time complexity of `O(2^n)`, since each element can either be in a subset or not.
- However, due to the memoization, many redundant states are avoided, potentially optimizing the average case significantly.
