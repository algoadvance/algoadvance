Given a string `sequence` and a string `word`, return the maximum integer `k` such that `word` is a substring of `sequence` repeated `k` times.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `sequence` and `word` contain non-alphabetic characters?**
   - Yes, both strings can contain any characters.

2. **Are `sequence` and `word` guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, `sequence` and `word` are non-empty as per the problem constraints.

3. **What is the maximum length of `sequence` and `word`?**
   - Typically, LeetCode constraints allow lengths up to 1000 or more, but for concrete values, refer to specific problem constraints.

### Strategy

The solution involves the following steps:
1. **Initialization**: Set a counter `k` to keep track of the maximum repeating count.
2. **Repeated Substring**: Construct a string `repeated_word` by repeating `word` `k` times.
3. **Checking Substring**: Check if `repeated_word` is a substring in `sequence`.
4. **Increment and Check**: Increment `k` until `repeated_word` is no longer a substring of `sequence`.
5. **Return Result**: Return the maximum `k - 1` because the loop exits when `repeated_word` is no longer a valid substring.

### Code

```python
def maxRepeating(sequence: str, word: str) -> int:
    k = 0
    while word * (k + 1) in sequence:
        k += 1
    return k
```

### Time Complexity

- **Construction of `repeated_word`**: This involves creating a new string which takes O(m*k) time, where `m` is the length of `word`.
- **Substring Check**: Each substring check of length `n` where `n` is the length of `sequence` can take O(n).

Combining these, the overall time complexity in the worst case scenario would be O(k * m * n), where:
- `k` is the number of times until `word * k` is no longer found in `sequence`.
- `m` is length of `word`.
- `n` is length of `sequence`.

However, in practical use, the string operations are highly optimized, making this approach efficient for typical constraints.
