title:  Circle and Rectangle Overlapping-out
permalink: /s1401
---

You are given a circle represented as `(radius, x_center, y_center)` and an axis-aligned rectangle represented as `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, where `(x1, y1)` is the coordinate of its bottom-left corner, and `(x2, y2)` is the coordinate of its top-right corner.

Determine if the circle and rectangle overlap. A circle and rectangle overlap if there is at least one point that is inside both the circle and the rectangle.

### Clarifying Questions

To ensure we clearly understand the problem, let's elaborate on some aspects:

1. **Definitions**:
    - The circle's boundary should be considered as part of the circle (same for the rectangle).
    - The rectangle is axis-aligned, meaning its sides are parallel to the axes.

2. **Input Constraints**:
    - The `radius` will be a positive float.
    - `x_center` and `y_center` are floats representing the center of the circle.
    - `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are floats such that `x1 < x2` and `y1 < y2`.

### Strategy

To determine if the circle and rectangle overlap, we need to find if any part of the rectangle is inside the circle or vice versa:

1. Compute the closest point on the rectangle to the circle's center. We do this by clamping the circle's center coordinates to the rectangle's boundaries.
2. Calculate the distance between this closest point and the circle's center.
3. If this distance is less than or equal to the circle's radius, then the circle and rectangle overlap.

### Code

```python
def isCircleAndRectangleOverlap(radius, x_center, y_center, x1, y1, x2, y2):
    # Find the closest point on the rectangle to the circle's center
    closest_x = min(max(x_center, x1), x2)
    closest_y = min(max(y_center, y1), y2)
    
    # Calculate the distance from the circle's center to this closest point
    distance_x = closest_x - x_center
    distance_y = closest_y - y_center
    
    # Compute the square of the distance
    distance_squared = distance_x ** 2 + distance_y ** 2
    
    # If this distance is within the radius, the circle and rectangle overlap
    return distance_squared <= radius ** 2

# Example usage
radius = 1.0
x_center = 0.0
y_center = 0.0
x1 = 1.0
y1 = -1.0
x2 = 3.0
y2 = 1.0

print(isCircleAndRectangleOverlap(radius, x_center, y_center, x1, y1, x2, y2))  # Output: True
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(1)\) because the operations (finding the closest point and calculating the distance) are performed using a constant number of arithmetic operations. This makes the solution very efficient.
