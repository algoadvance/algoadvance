title:  Number of Segments in a String-out
permalink: /s434
---

You are given a string `s`, and you need to count the number of segments in the string. A segment is defined to be a contiguous sequence of non-space characters. 

Write a function `countSegments` that returns the number of segments in the string `s`.

**Example:**

```python
Input: s = "Hello, my name is John"
Output: 5
```

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Does the input string contain only ASCII characters?**
   - Yes, you can assume the input contains only ASCII characters.

2. **Can the input string be empty?**
   - Yes, the input string can be empty. If the string is empty, the expected output should be `0`.

3. **Should I handle leading, trailing, or multiple spaces?**
   - Yes, your solution should handle leading, trailing, and multiple consecutive spaces between words correctly.

### Strategy:

The approach to solve this problem involves the following steps:
1. **Strip leading and trailing spaces**: This will help in simplifying our count. Even though this step is not necessary for counting, it might make the process more intuitive.
2. **Split the string by spaces**: Using `str.split()` will split the string into a list of words, automatically ignoring any number of spaces between words.
3. **Count the resulting list**: The final list's length will give us the number of segments.

Using Python's `str.split()` method is efficient because it handles multiple spaces and returns a list of substrings split by the whitespace.

### Code:

```python
def countSegments(s: str) -> int:
    # Split the string by spaces and count the segments
    return len(s.split())

# Example usage
s = "Hello, my name is John"
print(countSegments(s))  # Output: 5
```

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of the solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because the `split()` method iterates through the entire string once to split the words.

### Explanation:

1. `s.split()`: The `split()` method splits the string at each sequence of spaces, effectively handling multiple spaces as well as leading and trailing spaces. It returns a list of words.
2. `len()`: The `len()` function calculates the number of elements in the list returned by `split()`, which are the segments of the string.

In this way, the function `countSegments` counts the number of segments (words) in the given string efficiently.
