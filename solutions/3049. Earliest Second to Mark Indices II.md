title:  Earliest Second to Mark Indices II-out
permalink: /s3049
---

*You're given a string `s` and an array of intervals `[[start1, end1], [start2, end2], ...]`. Each interval represents a segment of the string that can be marked. You're allowed to use each interval any number of times. Your task is to find the earliest second after which all the characters in the string `s` become marked at least once.*

*Each second, you can mark all the characters within one of the intervals. Return the earliest second after which all the indices in the string `s` are marked.*

### Clarifying Questions

1. Is it guaranteed that the intervals can cover the whole string `s` over some seconds?
2. What should be the length or the constraints for the length of `s` and the values of the start and end positions of intervals?
3. Can intervals overlap?

For simplicity, let's assume:
- The string `s` has a length of up to \(10^4\).
- Intervals are within the 0-based index range of the string.

### Strategy

1. **Interval Coverage**: Utilize the given intervals for marking characters.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Use BFS to find the minimum number of moves (seconds) required to mark every character by leveraging state transitions that represent marking action.

**Steps**:
- Represent the state as a tuple where all marked characters are indicated (`marked` state).
- Use BFS to explore the shortest path to the state where every character in the string `s` is marked.
- Initialize the BFS with the start state where no characters are marked.
- For each state, apply all intervals to compute the next states.
- Use a queue to keep track of states and a set to keep track of visited states to avoid cycles.

### Code

```python
from collections import deque

def earliest_seconds_to_mark(s, intervals):
    n = len(s)
    
    # BFS initialization
    initial_state = 0  # No characters marked
    queue = deque([(initial_state, 0)])  # (state, time)
    visited = set()
    visited.add(initial_state)
    
    # All characters marked state
    all_marked_state = (1 << n) - 1

    while queue:
        state, time = queue.popleft()
        
        if state == all_marked_state:
            return time
        
        for start, end in intervals:
            new_state = state
            for i in range(start, end + 1):
                new_state |= (1 << i)
            
            if new_state not in visited:
                visited.add(new_state)
                queue.append((new_state, time + 1))
    
    return -1  # If it's impossible to mark all characters, although the prompt might guarantee a solution

# Example usage
s = "abcdef"
intervals = [[0, 1], [2, 5]]

print(earliest_seconds_to_mark(s, intervals))  # Expected result will depend on the specific intervals and the string length
```

### Time Complexity

- **State Space**: \(2^n\) where \(n\) is the length of `s`, since each character can be either marked or unmarked.
- **Per-State Transition**: For each state, applying all intervals takes \(\mathcal{O}(\text{number of intervals} \times \text{interval length})\) operations in worst case.

Based on these observations:
- The complexity is generally \(\mathcal{O}(2^n \times k \times l)\), where \(k\) is the number of intervals and \(l\) is the maximum length of an interval. Given \(n \leq 10^4\), optimally this should be managed within feasible limits using bitwise operations.

This approach leverages BFS for shortest path searching, ensuring we find the minimal number of seconds required to cover all indices efficiently.
