Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, return `true` if `s2` contains a permutation of `s1`, or `false` otherwise.

In other words, one of `s1`'s permutations is the substring of `s2`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidbaooo"
Output: true
Explanation: s2 contains one permutation of s1 ("ba").
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s1 = "ab", s2 = "eidboaoo"
Output: false
```

### Constraints:
- 1 <= s1.length, s2.length <= 10^4
- s1 and s2 consist of lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What constitutes a permutation?**
    - A permutation of a string is another string that contains the same characters, only the order of characters can be different.

2. **Can `s1` be longer than `s2`?**
    - No, since a permutation of `s1` would not fit in `s2` if `s1` is longer than `s2`.

3. **What if both `s1` and `s2` are empty?**
    - This is not possible as per the constraints `1 <= s1.length, s2.length`.

## Strategy

To determine if any permutation of `s1` is a substring of `s2`, we can use the sliding window technique along with character frequency counts:

1. **Character Count Matching:**
    - Count the frequency of each character in `s1`.
    - Maintain a sliding window of the same length as `s1` and count the frequency of characters in this window within `s2`.

2. **Sliding Window:**
    - Slide the window over `s2` and compare the frequency count of the current window to the frequency count of `s1`.
    - If they match at any point, return `true`.
    - If the window reaches the end of `s2` without a match, return `false`.

3. **Efficiency:**
    - Because each position in `s2` is processed a constant number of times, the time complexity should be linear, \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the length of `s2`.

## Code

Let's implement the described approach:

```python
def checkInclusion(s1: str, s2: str) -> bool:
    from collections import Counter
    
    len1, len2 = len(s1), len(s2)
    
    if len1 > len2:
        return False
    
    s1_count = Counter(s1)
    window_count = Counter(s2[:len1])
    
    if s1_count == window_count:
        return True
    
    for i in range(len1, len2):
        window_count[s2[i]] += 1
        window_count[s2[i - len1]] -= 1
        
        if window_count[s2[i - len1]] == 0:
            del window_count[s2[i - len1]]
        
        if s1_count == window_count:
            return True
    
    return False
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the length of `s2`. The sliding window process each character constant times.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\). The space is constant because the dictionary size or the Counter will not exceed the number of English letters (26).

By following this strategy and implementing the sliding window approach, we ensure an efficient solution to the problem.
