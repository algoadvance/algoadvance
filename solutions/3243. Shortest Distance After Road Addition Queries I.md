title:  Shortest Distance After Road Addition Queries I-out
permalink: /s3243
---

You are given a graph with `n` nodes and `m` edges. Each edge has a weight of 1. You need to answer `q` queries. Each query consists of two nodes `u` and `v` and asks what the shortest distance between them would be if you added a single additional road (an edge) between any two nodes that donâ€™t currently have a road. If there are multiple optimal edges that can be added, any one of them can be chosen.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the node indices 0-based or 1-based?
2. Can roads be added between any two nodes, including those that already have multiple edges?
3. Could you clarify the constraints for `n`, `m`, and `q`?
4. Can roads lead to a graph with cycles or is it strictly a tree structure initially?

### Strategy

The plan is as follows:

1. **Initial Shortest Path Calculation**: Use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to compute the shortest paths between all pairs of nodes initially.
2. **Query Processing**: For each query:
   - Evaluate the current shortest distance between `u` and `v`.
   - Attempt to find the shortest detouring distance across all potential edges that can be added.
   - Specifically, for each possible edge `(i, j)`, compute the potential new shortest distance considering the addition of this edge.

### Code

Here's a skeleton of the solution in Python.

```python
def floyd_warshall(n, graph):
    dist = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    for i in range(n):
        dist[i][i] = 0
    
    for u, v in graph:
        dist[u][v] = 1
        dist[v][u] = 1
    
    for k in range(n):
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if dist[i][j] > dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]:
                    dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]
    
    return dist

def shortest_distance_after_road_addition(n, m, edges, queries):
    dist = floyd_warshall(n, edges)
    results = []
    
    for u, v in queries:
        original_distance = dist[u][v]
        min_distance = original_distance
        
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(i + 1, n):
                if dist[i][j] > 1:  # Check if there's no edge between i and j
                    potential_distance = min(dist[u][i] + 1 + dist[j][v], dist[u][j] + 1 + dist[i][v])
                    min_distance = min(min_distance, potential_distance)
        
        results.append(min_distance)
    
    return results

# Sample Usage
n = 4
m = 4
edges = [(0, 1), (1, 2), (2, 3), (3, 0)]
queries = [(0, 2), (1, 3)]
print(shortest_distance_after_road_addition(n, m, edges, queries))
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: The time complexity for the Floyd-Warshall algorithm is `O(n^3)`.
2. **Query Processing**: For each query, we evaluate adding every possible new edge which takes `O(n^2)` for each query. Thus, for `q` queries, it adds up to `q * O(n^2)`.

So the overall time complexity is:

- Initial shortest path computation: `O(n^3)`
- Query processing: `q * O(n^2)`

If `q` is large, this could be significant, but it is manageable given typical constraints on problem sizes.
