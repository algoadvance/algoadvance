title:  Minimum Difference in Sums After Removal of Elements-out
permalink: /s2163
---

Given an integer array `nums` of size `3n`, you are asked to perform the following steps to form two new arrays `a` and `b`:

1. Split the array `nums` into three contiguous subarrays of size `n` each, i.e., `nums = nums1 + nums2 + nums3` where each of `nums1`, `nums2`, and `nums3` has a length of `n`.
2. Select `n` elements from `nums1` and `n` elements from `nums3` such that the absolute difference of the sums of selected elements from `nums1` and `nums3` is minimized.

Return the minimum absolute difference between the sums of two arrays after the operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the elements in `nums` be negative?**
   - Yes, the problem doesn't restrict the nature of the integers in `nums`.

2. **What are the constraints on the values of `n` and the elements in `nums`?**
   - The value of `n` would be such that the size of `nums` is always `3n`.
   - The elements in `nums` can range widely, as per typical LeetCode problem constraints.

3. **Is there any constraint on the size of `nums` other than it being divisible by 3?**
   - No specific constraint other than it being a multiple of 3.

Given this problem, we need to devise a strategy that efficiently calculates the minimum difference between the sums of elements from two newly formed subarrays.

### Strategy

1. **Splitting and Sorting**: Split the array into three parts. However, we need to select `n` elements from the first `2n` elements (to form 'a') and the last `2n` elements (to form 'b').

2. **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: Use a min-heap for the first `2n` elements to keep track of the smallest `n` elements, and a max-heap for the last `2n` elements to keep track of the largest `n` elements.

3. **Calculating Sums**:
    - Calculate the sum of the smallest `n` elements from the first two-thirds using a prefix array.
    - Calculate the sum of the largest `n` elements from the last two-thirds using a suffix array.

4. **Finding Minimum Difference**: Compute the differences and track the minimum difference encountered.

### Code

```python
import heapq

def minimumDifference(nums):
    n = len(nums) // 3
    left_heap = []
    right_heap = []
    
    left_sum = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
    right_sum = [0] * (2 * n + 1)
    
    # Compute sum of smallest `n` elements for first `2n` elements
    total_left = 0
    for i in range(2 * n):
        heapq.heappush(left_heap, -nums[i])
        total_left += nums[i]
        if len(left_heap) > n:
            total_left += heapq.heappop(left_heap)
        left_sum[i + 1] = total_left
    
    # Compute sum of largest `n` elements for last `2n` elements
    total_right = 0
    for i in range(2 * n - 1, -1, -1):
        heapq.heappush(right_heap, nums[i + n])
        total_right += nums[i + n]
        if len(right_heap) > n:
            total_right -= heapq.heappop(right_heap)
        right_sum[i] = total_right
    
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(n, 2 * n + 1):
        min_diff = min(min_diff, left_sum[i] - right_sum[i])
    
    return min_diff

# Example usage
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 1, 2, 3]
print(minimumDifference(nums))  # Expected output depends on the problem constraints and input
```

### Time Complexity
- **Heap Operations**: Each insertion or deletion operation in the heap takes `O(log n)`.
- **Overall**: Since we are performing these operations for `2n` elements, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`. This is efficient given standard constraints in competitive programming.

This code effectively breaks down the problem, uses efficient data structures to maintain required subarray sums, and computes the minimum difference as required.
