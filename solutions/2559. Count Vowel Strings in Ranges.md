title:  Count Vowel Strings in Ranges-out
permalink: /s2559
---

Given a zero-indexed array of strings `words` and a 2D array `queries`, where `queries[j] = [l_j, r_j]` represents the j-th query, you need to perform the following operations:

- Count the number of strings in the subarray `words[l_j : r_j + 1]` that start and end with a vowel.
- Return an array `results` where `results[j]` is the result for the j-th query.

**Note:**
Vowels in English are `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, and `'u'`.

### Example:

```python
words = ["apple", "banana", "ace", "emote"]
queries = [[0, 2], [1, 3]]

#Expected output: [2, 1]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. What are the bounds on the length of `words` and `queries` arrays?
2. Can the words in the `words` array contain uppercase letters?
3. Are the indices in `queries` guaranteed to be valid?

### Strategy
1. **Base Check for Vowels:** We'll start by creating a helper function to identify if a string starts and ends with a vowel.
2. **Prefill a Vowel Check Array:** Prepare a boolean list that checks each string in `words` to see if it starts and ends with a vowel.
3. **Prefix Sum Array:** Create a prefix sum array from the boolean list to efficiently compute the number of valid strings in any given range.
4. **Answer Queries:** For each query, use the prefix sum array to get the count of valid strings in constant time.

### Time Complexity
- Preparing the boolean list takes O(n) where n is the length of `words`.
- Building the prefix sum array takes O(n).
- Each query can be answered in O(1) using the prefix sum array.
So, the overall time complexity is O(n + m) where m is the number of queries.

### Python Code

```python
def count_vowel_strings(words, queries):
    vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}
    
    def is_vowel(s):
        return s[0] in vowels and s[-1] in vowels
    
    n = len(words)
    valid_vowel_strings = [1 if is_vowel(word) else 0 for word in words]
    
    # Build prefix sum array
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + valid_vowel_strings[i]
    
    # Process each query
    results = []
    for l, r in queries:
        count = prefix_sum[r + 1] - prefix_sum[l]
        results.append(count)
    
    return results

# Example usage
words = ["apple", "banana", "ace", "emote"]
queries = [[0, 2], [1, 3]]
print(count_vowel_strings(words, queries))  # Output: [2, 1]
```

### Explanation of Code
1. **is_vowel:** This helper function checks if a given word starts and ends with a vowel.
2. **valid_vowel_strings:** This list stores `1` for words that start and end with a vowel and `0` otherwise.
3. **prefix_sum:** The prefix sum array helps in calculating the sum of elements quickly between any two indices.
4. **Results Calculation:** For each query, the count of valid strings is computed using the difference between the corresponding prefix sums.

### Edge Cases
1. Confirm that words with single characters are correctly handled.
2. Ensure the function is case insensitive if needed.
3. Handle empty `words` or `queries` lists.
