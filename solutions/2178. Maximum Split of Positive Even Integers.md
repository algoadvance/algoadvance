title:  Maximum Split of Positive Even Integers-out
permalink: /s2178
---

You are given a positive integer `finalSum`. You need to split it into an array of **unique** positive even integers whose sum is equal to `finalSum`. Return the maximum number of integers that you can make, or an empty array if it's not possible.

**Example 1:**

Input: `finalSum = 12`
Output: `[2, 4, 6]`

**Example 2:**

Input: `finalSum = 7`
Output: `[]`

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= finalSum <= 10^10`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are we guaranteed to always have a solution if `finalSum` is even?
   **A:** No, but if `finalSum` is odd, there is definitely no solution because all positive even integers sum to an even number.
   
2. **Q:** Is the order of integers in the resulting array important?
   **A:** No, as long as they are unique positive even integers.

3. **Q:** What should be returned if no valid split exists?
   **A:** An empty array `[]`.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Check:**
   - If `finalSum` is odd, immediately return an empty array `[]` because it cannot be split into even integers.

2. **Iterative Construction:**
   - Iterate with an increasing even number starting from `2`.
   - Keep adding the next even number to the result list as long as the remaining `finalSum` (after subtracting the current number) is greater than the next candidate even number.
   - If the remaining `finalSum` is not sufficient for the next unique even number, simply add the remaining `finalSum` as the final number since it will still be even at this point.

This greedy approach ensures each step is maximized for the number of unique even integers.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(sqrt(finalSum)) in the worst case because the sum of the first `n` even numbers approximately follows the arithmetic series sum.
- **Space Complexity:** O(sqrt(finalSum)) for storing the resulting split.

### Code

```python
def maximumEvenSplit(finalSum: int):
    if finalSum % 2 != 0:
        return []

    result = []
    current_even = 2
    while finalSum >= current_even:
        result.append(current_even)
        finalSum -= current_even
        current_even += 2

    if finalSum > 0:
        result[-1] += finalSum

    return result
```

### Explanation of the Code

- We first check if `finalSum` is odd. If it is, return an empty list.
- We initialize an empty list `result` to store the unique even integers.
- We start with the smallest even number `2` and iteratively add it to `result` while subtracting it from `finalSum`.
- If at any point the remaining `finalSum` cannot accommodate the next even number, we simply adjust the last added even number to include the remaining `finalSum`.

Using this approach, we ensure that we get the maximum number of unique even integers summing up to `finalSum`.
