title:  Check If String Is Transformable With Substring Sort Operations-out
permalink: /s1585
---

Given two strings `s` and `t`, you need to determine if the string `s` can be transformed into the string `t` using the following operation any number of times:

- Pick a substring of `s` and sort it in-place.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are both strings `s` and `t` guaranteed to be of the same length?**
   - *Yes, both strings are of the same length.*

2. **What kind of characters do `s` and `t` contain?**
   - *Both strings contain only digits from '0' to '9'.*

3. **Can substrings overlap during the sorting operation?**
   - *Yes, substrings can overlap and each substring can be sorted in-place independently.*

4. **Is it a guarantee that both strings are non-empty?**
   - *Yes, both strings are guaranteed to be non-empty and of the same length.*

## Strategy

1. **Count Verification**:
   - First, check if both strings `s` and `t` have the same frequency of each digit. This is necessary for `s` to be transformed into `t`.

2. **Transformation Feasibility Check**:
   - Iterate through each digit from '0' to '9'. For each digit, we need to ensure that the positions of the digits in `s` respect the order in `t`. Specifically, if we want to move a digit `d` to a position `j` in `t`, every occurrence of any digit less than `d` in `s` before position `j` must occur before `j` in `t`.

## Code

```python
def isTransformable(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    from collections import deque
    
    # Check if both strings have the same frequency of each digit
    if sorted(s) != sorted(t):
        return False
    
    # Create queues to store the indices of each digit in the string `s`
    pos = [deque() for _ in range(10)]
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        pos[int(char)].append(i)
    
    # Process each character in `t`
    for char in t:
        digit = int(char)
        
        # If the digit `char` is not present in the current queue, it's incorrect
        if not pos[digit]:
            return False
        
        # Get the position of the current digit
        current_pos = pos[digit].popleft()
        
        # We need to ensure that no smaller digit appears before the current_pos in t
        for smaller_digit in range(digit):
            if pos[smaller_digit] and pos[smaller_digit][0] < current_pos:
                return False
    
    return True
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting Step**: `O(N log N)` because we sort the strings to check if they have the same frequency of each digit.
- **Index Storage and Verification**: The storage involves linear passes to store indices in deques and verify positions, which is `O(N)`.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which is `O(N log N)`, where `N` is the length of the string `s` (or `t`). The space complexity is `O(N)` due to the use of deques to store positions.
