title:  Count Ways to Build Rooms in an Ant Colony-out
permalink: /s1916
---

You are given an array `prevRoom` where `prevRoom[i]` indicates that there is a directed edge from room `prevRoom[i]` to room `i`. Your task is to build these rooms starting from room `0`, which is the root of the tree formed by these edges. Each room can only be built if all its ancestor rooms have already been built.

You need to find the number of ways to build all the rooms in such a way that any valid method is counted exactly once. Return your answer modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Example:

**Input:**
```
prevRoom = [-1, 0, 1]
```

**Output:**
```
1
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= prevRoom.length <= 10^5`
- `prevRoom[0] == -1`
- `0 <= prevRoom[i] < i` for all `1 <= i < prevRoom.length`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Tree Properties:**
   - The problem confirms that the input forms a valid tree structure (i.e., no cycles and exactly one root which is room 0).

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Result should be modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Strategy

1. **Tree Representation:**
   - Represent the given tree using an adjacency list to easily navigate and build relationships between rooms.

2. **Dynamic Programming with Factorials:**
   - Use Dynamic Programming (DP) to break down the problem recursively, leveraging combinatorial mathematics to count valid orderings.
   - Calculate factorial and inverse factorial using modular arithmetic for efficiency.

3. **Depth-First Search:**
   - Traverse the tree using Depth-First Search (DFS) to process each subtree, combining results from child nodes to contribute to the parent node.

4. **Modular Arithmetic:**
   - Use the properties of modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and ensure results fit within the constraints.

## Code

Here's the complete solution for the problem:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

class Solution:
    def waysToBuildRooms(self, prevRoom):
        from functools import lru_cache
        from collections import defaultdict
        
        n = len(prevRoom)
        
        tree = defaultdict(list)
        for i in range(1, n):
            tree[prevRoom[i]].append(i)
        
        # Precompute factorials and modular inverses up to n!
        fac = [1] * (n + 1)
        ifac = [1] * (n + 1)

        for i in range(2, n + 1):
            fac[i] = fac[i-1] * i % MOD
        
        ifac[n] = pow(fac[n], MOD-2, MOD)
        for i in range(n-1, 0, -1):
            ifac[i] = ifac[i+1] * (i+1) % MOD

        @lru_cache(None)
        def nCr(n, r):
            if n < r: return 0
            return fac[n] * ifac[r] % MOD * ifac[n-r] % MOD

        def dfs(node):
            ways, size = 1, 1
            for child in tree[node]:
                subways, subsize = dfs(child)
                ways = ways * subways % MOD * nCr(size + subsize - 1, subsize) % MOD
                size += subsize
            return ways, size
        
        result, _ = dfs(0)
        return result

# Example usage:
sol = Solution()
print(sol.waysToBuildRooms([-1, 0, 1]))  # Output: 1
```

## Time Complexity

- **Precomputation of Factorials:** \( O(n) \)
- **DFS Traversal:** \( O(n) \)
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(n) \) due to the tree representation, factorials, and the recursion stack.

Overall, the solution efficiently handles the problem within the given constraints.
