title:  Valid Triangle Number-out
permalink: /s611
---
Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of triplets chosen from the array that can make triangles if we take them as side lengths of a triangle.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [2,2,3,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: Valid combinations are:
             2,3,4 (using the first 2)
             2,3,4 (using the second 2)
             2,2,3
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [4,2,3,4]
Output: 4
Explanation: Valid combinations are three 4,3,4 and one 2,3,4.
```

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
- 0 <= nums[i] <= 1000

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the array contain duplicate elements?
   - Yes, as evident from the example.
2. What should be done if any side length is zero?
   - Zero cannot be a part of any triangle, so we can skip such cases. Given the constraints and problem nature, we assume handling them appropriately.
3. Should the solution handle negative side lengths?
   - The problem guarantees non-negative integers for side lengths, so no need to handle negative values.

## Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we use the fact that for any three sides to form a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side. We particularly leverage the sorted order of the array to reduce the number of comparisons:

1. **Sort the Array:** Sorting helps in applying the triangle inequality more straightforwardly.
2. **Three-Pointer Approach:** Use three nested loops but optimized to avoid unnecessary comparisons:
   - Fix one side (let it be the longest side).
   - Use two pointers to check pairs from the remaining part of the array to see if they form a triangle.
   
### Detailed Steps:
1. **Sort the Array:** This allows us to focus on the relationship `nums[i] + nums[j] > nums[k]` more easily.
2. **Nested Loop Approach:** Use nested loops, but instead of `O(n^3)` complexity, optimize it by leveraging the sorted nature:
   - Use the innermost loop combined with two pointers technique to directly count valid triangles.

### Pseudocode:
- Sort the array.
- Use three nested loops.
- For the innermost loop, start with two pointers, potentially reducing the complexity to `O(n^2)`.

## Code
```python
def triangleNumber(nums):
    nums.sort()
    count = 0
    n = len(nums)
    
    for i in range(n-2):
        k = i + 2
        for j in range(i+1, n-1):
            while k < n and nums[i] + nums[j] > nums[k]:
                k += 1
            count += k - j - 1
    
    return count
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting:** `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **Nested Loops:** The outer two loops go through the array making it `O(n^2)`, and the innermost while-loop runs in constant time on average over all iterations.
- **Overall Time Complexity:** `O(n^2)`, which is efficient for the given constraints (`n <= 1000`).

This solution ensures that we consider only those side lengths that can actually form a triangle by sorting and strategically using the triangle inequality rule.
