title:  Count Pairs Whose Sum is Less than Target-out
permalink: /s2824
---

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `target`. Your task is to find the number of pairs `(i, j)` where `0 <= i < j < n` and `nums[i] + nums[j] < target`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range and size of the `nums` array?**
   - Typical constraints could vary, but let's assume `n` can be between \( 2 \) and \( 10^5 \), and the elements of `nums` can vary between \( -10^9 \) and \( 10^9 \).

2. **What is the range of the `target`?**
   - The `target` is likely to fall within the range of the sum of two extreme elements, i.e., \(-2 \times 10^9\) to \( 2 \times 10^9\).

3. **Can the array contain duplicates?**
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicate values.

### Strategy

Let's break down the strategy to solve this problem efficiently.

1. **Brute Force Approach:**
   Loop through all pairs `(i, j)` and count the pairs where `nums[i] + nums[j] < target`. This approach has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\), which is not efficient for large arrays.

2. **Optimized Approach:**
   - **Sorting and Two-Pointer Technique:**
     - First, sort the array.
     - Use two pointers (`left` and `right`). Initially set `left` at the start (0) and `right` at the end (n-1) of the array.
     - If `nums[left] + nums[right] < target`, it implies all combinations from `left` to `right-1` with `nums[left]` will also be less than target, allowing us to count more efficiently.

### Code

Here is an efficient implementation using the optimized approach:

```python
def count_pairs(nums, target):
    nums.sort()  # Sort the array first
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    count = 0
    
    while left < right:
        if nums[left] + nums[right] < target:
            # If nums[left] + nums[right] is less than target,
            # then all pairs (left, right), (left, right-1), ..., (left, left+1)
            # will also be less than target
            count += right - left
            left += 1
        else:
            right -= 1
    
    return count

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
target = 7
print(count_pairs(nums, target))  # Output: 7
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting: O(n log n):** Sorting the array takes \(O(n \log n)\) time.
- **Two-pointer traversal: O(n):** Each element is visited at most twice (once by left pointer and once by right pointer).

Overall, the time complexity of this approach is \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient and suitable for large input sizes.
