title:  Count Sub Islands-out
permalink: /s1905
---

You are given two `m x n` binary matrices `grid1` and `grid2` containing only 0's (representing water) and 1's (representing land). An island is a group of 1's connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical). 

An island in `grid2` is considered a sub-island if there is an island in `grid1` that contains all the cells of that island in `grid2`.

Return the number of sub-islands in `grid2`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the grid dimensions (`m` and `n`)?**
   - Typical constraints for this kind of problem are `1 <= m, n <= 500`.

2. **Can the grids `grid1` and `grid2` change during the process?**
   - No, the grids are fixed during the process. However, we can use visited markers within a DFS or similar traversal method.

3. **Can the grids contain only 1's and 0's?**
   - Yes, both grids contain only binary values (1's and 0's).

4. **What happens if there's an overlap of islands that are not considered sub-islands?**
   - They're simply not counted as sub-islands.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to identify islands in `grid2` and check if they are sub-islands based on the corresponding islands in `grid1`. Here is the step-by-step strategy:

1. **DFS/BFS for Island Detection**:
   - Perform a DFS/BFS on each cell in `grid2` to find all islands.
   - Mark cells in `grid2` when they are visited to avoid counting the same island multiple times.

2. **Sub-island Verification**:
   - During the DFS/BFS, simultaneously check the corresponding cells in `grid1`.
   - If at any point we find a cell in an island in `grid2` that isnâ€™t part of an island in `grid1`, mark the island as not a sub-island.

3. **Count Sub-Islands**:
   - Count only those islands in `grid2` that fully correspond with islands in `grid1`.

### Code

```python
def countSubIslands(grid1, grid2):
    def dfs(grid, i, j):
        """ Helper function to perform DFS on grid2 and check with grid1 """
        if i < 0 or i >= len(grid) or j < 0 or j >= len(grid[0]) or grid[i][j] == 0:
            return True
        if visited[i][j]:
            return True
        
        visited[i][j] = True
        is_sub = True
        if grid1[i][j] == 0:
            is_sub = False
        
        # Continue DFS in 4 directions
        for di, dj in [(0,1), (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0)]:
            is_sub = dfs(grid, i + di, j + dj) and is_sub
        
        return is_sub
    
    m, n = len(grid1), len(grid2[0])
    visited = [[False] * n for _ in range(m)]
    sub_islands = 0
    
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if grid2[i][j] == 1 and not visited[i][j]:
                if dfs(grid2, i, j):
                    sub_islands += 1
    
    return sub_islands

# Example usage
grid1 = [
    [1,1,1,0,0],
    [0,1,1,1,0],
    [0,0,0,1,0],
    [1,1,0,0,0]
]

grid2 = [
    [1,1,1,0,0],
    [0,0,1,1,0],
    [0,1,0,1,1],
    [1,1,0,0,0]
]

print(countSubIslands(grid1, grid2))  # Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **DFS Traversal**: Each cell is visited once, leading to a time complexity of \(O(m \times n)\), where `m` and `n` are the dimensions of the grid.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also \(O(m \times n)\) due to the visited matrix and the recursion stack for DFS.

This solution efficiently finds and counts sub-islands by ensuring a consistent traversal and comparison of both grids.
