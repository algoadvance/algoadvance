title:  Minimum Interval to Include Each Query-out
permalink: /s1851
---
Given an array of intervals where intervals[i] = [lefti, righti] represent the inclusive range [lefti, righti], and an array of queries where queries[j] is the j-th query. For each query, you need to find the minimum interval from the array of intervals such that the query lies within the interval. If no such interval exists for a query, return -1 for that query.

Return an array of length equal to the number of queries where the j-th element is the answer to the j-th query.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What are the constraints on the number of intervals and queries?
2. Can intervals overlap?
3. Are the intervals and queries sorted in any manner?
4. What is the range of values that can appear in the intervals and queries?

### Strategy
Here's the plan:
1. **Sorting**:
   - Sort the intervals primarily by their starting point.
   - Sort the queries but keep track of their original indices.
  
2. **Using a Min-Heap**:
   - Use a minimum heap to keep track of the intervals that are currently valid for the current query.
   - As we iterate through sorted queries, add applicable intervals to the heap.
   - Remove intervals from the heap that no longer satisfy the conditions.
   - Always check the top of the heap to get the minimum interval that includes the current query.

### Code
Let's implement the solution in Python:

```python
from heapq import heappush, heappop

def minInterval(intervals, queries):
    # Sort intervals by their start point
    intervals.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
    
    # Sort queries and store their original indices
    sorted_queries = sorted((q, i) for i, q in enumerate(queries))
    
    # Initialize the result array with -1 values
    res = [-1] * len(queries)
    
    min_heap = []
    i = 0  # Pointer for intervals

    for query, index in sorted_queries:
        # Add all intervals that start before or when the query occurs
        while i < len(intervals) and intervals[i][0] <= query:
            left, right = intervals[i]
            # Only consider intervals where the query is within the interval
            if right >= query:
                heappush(min_heap, (right - left + 1, right))  # Push interval size and end point
            i += 1
        
        # Remove intervals from the heap where the end is before the current query
        while min_heap and min_heap[0][1] < query:
            heappop(min_heap)
        
        # If heap is not empty, the top element is the smallest interval containing the query
        if min_heap:
            res[index] = min_heap[0][0]
    
    return res

# Example Usage
intervals = [[1,4], [2,4], [3,6]]
queries = [2, 3, 4, 5]
print(minInterval(intervals, queries))  # Output: [3, 3, 3, 6]
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Sorting**:
   - Sorting intervals: O(n log n)
   - Sorting queries: O(m log m)

2. **Heap Operations**:
   - Each interval could be pushed and popped from the heap only once => O(n log n)
   - Each query involves a constant-time heap operation on average => O(m log n)

Combining these, the overall time complexity is O((n + m) log n). This is efficient given the nature of the problem. Here, 'n' is the number of intervals, and 'm' is the number of queries.
