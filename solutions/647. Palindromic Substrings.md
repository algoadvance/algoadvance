title:  Palindromic Substrings-out
permalink: /s647
---
Given a string `s`, return the number of palindromic substrings in it. A string is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input constraints?**
   - The input string `s` will be of length at most `1000`.
   
2. **Type of characters in the input string?**
   - The input string `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.

3. **Example cases?**
   - Example 1:
     - Input: `s = "abc"`
     - Output: `3` because `a`, `b`, and `c` are palindromic.

   - Example 2:
     - Input: `s = "aaa"`
     - Output: `6` because `a`, `a`, `a`, `aa`, `aa`, `aaa` are palindromic.

### Strategy
We'll use the "Expand Around Center" strategy. The idea is to consider each possible center for odd and even-length palindromes and attempt to expand outward as long as the substring remains a palindrome.

1. **Initialize a counter `count` to 0**.
2. **Loop through each character** in the string `s`, treating each character as the center of an odd-length palindrome.
3. **Expand from the center** and count all valid palindromic substrings.
4. Repeat the process for **even-length palindromes** by considering pairs of adjacent characters as the center.
5. **Count up** all the palindromic substrings found and return the result.

### Time Complexity
Since each center expansion takes O(N) time in the worst case, and there are `2N - 1` such centers (each character and space between characters), the overall time complexity is:

- **O(N^2)**, where N is the length of the string `s`.

### Code
Here's the implementation of the strategy described:

```python
def countSubstrings(s: str) -> int:
    def expand_around_center(left: int, right: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        while left >= 0 and right < len(s) and s[left] == s[right]:
            count += 1
            left -= 1
            right += 1
        return count

    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)):
        # Count odd-length palindromic substrings
        count += expand_around_center(i, i)
        # Count even-length palindromic substrings
        count += expand_around_center(i, i + 1)
    
    return count

# Example Usage
print(countSubstrings("abc"))  # Output: 3
print(countSubstrings("aaa"))  # Output: 6
```

This solution efficiently counts the palindromic substrings using the expand-around-center approach, ensuring a thorough check of all possible palindromes within the given string `s`.
