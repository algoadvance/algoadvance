title:  Largest Merge Of Two Strings-out
permalink: /s1754
---

You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. You want to construct a string `merge` using the letters from `word1` and `word2`, such that `merge` is lexicographically largest.

Return the lexicographically largest `merge` that you can construct.

**Example 1:**
- Input: `word1 = "cabaa"`, `word2 = "bcaaa"`
- Output: `"cbcabaaaaa"`

**Example 2:**
- Input: `word1 = "abcabc"`, `word2 = "abdcaba"`
- Output: `"abdcabcabcaba"`

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 3000`
- `word1` and `word2` consist only of lowercase English letters.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any restrictions on how many characters we can take from each string?**
   - We can take as many characters as we want from each string, as long as they appear in order.
   
2. **Do we need to exhaust both strings when constructing the merge?**
   - Yes, we need to use all characters from both strings.

3. **What should we do if the remaining parts of `word1` and `word2` are identical?**
   - We can choose from either string, but to maintain the lexicographical order, we should pick the largest remaining prefix.

### Strategy

1. **Greedy Approach:**
   - We can utilize a greedy approach to construct the lexicographically largest string.
   - At each step, compare the current suffixes of `word1` and `word2`.
   - Append the lexicographically larger character (or suffix) to the result and move the pointer of the corresponding string forward.
   - This ensures that we are getting the largest possible character at every step according to the remaining part of the strings.

### Code

```python
def largestMerge(word1: str, word2: str) -> str:
    merge = []
    i, j = 0, 0
    len_word1, len_word2 = len(word1), len(word2)
    
    while i < len_word1 and j < len_word2:
        # Compare the suffixes of word1 and word2 starting from i and j respectively
        if word1[i:] > word2[j:]:
            merge.append(word1[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            merge.append(word2[j])
            j += 1
    
    # Append remaining characters if any
    if i < len_word1:
        merge.append(word1[i:])
    if j < len_word2:
        merge.append(word2[j:])
    
    return ''.join(merge)

# Example usage
print(largestMerge("cabaa", "bcaaa"))  # Output: "cbcabaaaaa"
print(largestMerge("abcabc", "abdcaba"))  # Output: "abdcabcabcaba"
```

### Time Complexity

- **Comparisons:** At each step, we perform a comparison `word1[i:] > word2[j:]`, which can take up to \(O(n + m)\) in the worst case where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `word1` and `word2` respectively.
- **Overall Complexity:** Although a naive analysis might suggest a high complexity due to suffix comparison, practical string comparison operations in competitive programming are very optimized, making the actual runtime more efficient. Therefore, the average case might be \(O(n + m)\).

The greedy strategy along with string slicing and comparison ensures we construct the lexicographically largest merge efficiently.
