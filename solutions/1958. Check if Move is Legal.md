title:  Check if Move is Legal-out
permalink: /s1958

You are given a  `boardÂ ` of size `n x n` and a move consisting of coordinates `(rMove, cMove)` representing the next position of a player. The board could have three types of cells:
- 'B' signifies a black piece,
- 'W' signifies a white piece,
- '.' signifies an empty cell.

The move is considered legal if, after placing the player's piece on `(rMove, cMove)`, the piece encloses at least one of the opponent's pieces. A piece is considered enclosed if it is in a straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) and bounded by two pieces of the current player.

Write a function `isMoveLegal(board: List[List[str]], rMove: int, cMove: int, color: str) -> bool` that returns `True` if the move is legal, otherwise `False`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the possible values of `n`?**
   - The size of the board `n` should be determined (it is typically >= 1).

2. **Is it guaranteed that `rMove` and `cMove` are within the bounds of the board?**
   - It should be clarified if boundary checks are required.

3. **Can there be multiple empty cells on the board?**
   - Confirm if there can be multiple empty cells or not.

### Strategy

1. **Place the Piece:** Place the player's piece at `(rMove, cMove)`.
2. **Define Directions:** Identify all possible directions (horizontal, vertical, and diagonal).
3. **Check for Enclosure:** For each direction, traverse the board from `(rMove, cMove)` to check if the move encloses any opponent's pieces.
4. **Return Result:** Return `True` if at least one direction confirms the enclosure, otherwise return `False`.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the length of the board edge. Each direction check involves traversing the length of the board in the worst case.

### Code

Here's a possible implementation in Python:

```python
from typing import List

def isMoveLegal(board: List[List[str]], rMove: int, cMove: int, color: str) -> bool:
    n = len(board)
    opponent = 'B' if color == 'W' else 'W'
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1), (-1, -1), (1, 1), (-1, 1), (1, -1)]

    def is_enclosed(r_start, c_start, dr, dc):
        r, c = r_start + dr, c_start + dc
        found_opponent = False
        while 0 <= r < n and 0 <= c < n:
            if board[r][c] == '.':
                return False
            if board[r][c] == opponent:
                found_opponent = True
            elif board[r][c] == color:
                return found_opponent
            r += dr
            c += dc
        return False

    # Place the move and check all directions
    board[rMove][cMove] = color
    for dr, dc in directions:
        if is_enclosed(rMove, cMove, dr, dc):
            return True
        
    return False

# Example usage:
board = [
    ['.', 'B', '.'],
    ['W', 'W', 'B'],
    ['.', 'B', '.']
]
print(isMoveLegal(board, 1, 0, 'W'))  # Output should be True or False depending on the legality of the move
```

This function checks all possible directions from the move and determines if any of them result in an enclosure of opponent pieces, thereby validating the move.
