title:  Separate the Digits in an Array-out
permalink: /s2553
---

You are given a list of positive integers `nums`. You need to return a list containing the digits of each number separated into individual elements in the same order they appear in the original list.

For example, if the input list is `[123, 45, 7]`, the output should be `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**: Are there any constraints on the size of the numbers in the array or the array itself?
   - Assume the numbers are within the typical range for integers handled in Python.
   
2. **Negative Numbers**: Are the numbers always positive as stated?
   - Yes, the problem specifies they are positive integers.

3. **Order**: Should the digits be returned in the exact order they appear in the input list?
   - Yes, the digits must preserve the order from the input list.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate through the List**: Loop through each number in the input list `nums`.
2. **Extract Digits**: Convert each number to a string to easily iterate over each digit.
3. **Append Digits**: Convert each digit back to an integer and append it to the result list.
4. **Return the Result**: After processing all numbers, return the resulting list of digits.

We maintain the order of digits by sequentially processing numbers and their digits.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * k)`, where `n` is the number of integers in the list and `k` is the average number of digits per integer. This complexity arises because we need to process each digit of each number.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n * k)`, as we need additional space to store all digits separately.

### Code

Here is the implementation of the strategy discussed above:

```python
def separate_digits(nums):
    result = []
    for num in nums:
        result.extend([int(digit) for digit in str(num)])
    return result

# Test the function with an example case
print(separate_digits([123, 45, 7]))  # Expected output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7]
```

This function will iterate over each number in the provided list `nums`, convert each number to a string to extract individual digits, then convert those digits back to integers, and add them to the result list. Finally, it returns the consolidated list of separated digits.
