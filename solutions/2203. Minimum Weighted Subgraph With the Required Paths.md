title:  Minimum Weighted Subgraph With the Required Paths-out
permalink: /s2203
---

You are given a positive integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a directed weighted graph, where the nodes are labeled from `0` to `n-1`. You are also given a 2D array `edges` where `edges[i] = [fromi, toi, weighti]` represents a directed edge from node `fromi` to node `toi` with the weight `weighti`.

Additionally, you are given three distinct integers `src1`, `src2`, and `dst` representing three distinct nodes in the graph.

Your goal is to find the minimum weight of a subgraph that contains the following paths:
1. A path from `src1` to `dst`.
2. A path from `src2` to `dst`.

If no such subgraph exists, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

Before we proceed to solve the problem, let's clarify a few questions:
1. Can the edges have negative weights?
2. Are there any constraints on the weights of the edges?
3. Can we assume the graph is connected?
4. Is there any specific format for the output?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can make use of Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest paths. Here's the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Shortest Path Calculation**:
    - Use Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path from `src1` to all other nodes.
    - Use Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path from `src2` to all other nodes.
    - Use Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path from `dst` to all other nodes in the reversed graph (this helps in finding the shortest path to `dst`).

2. **Finding Minimum Weight**:
    - For each node `i`, calculate the total distance as the sum of the shortest paths from `src1` to `i`, `src2` to `i`, and `dst` to `i`.
    - Take the minimum of all such total distances.

This approach helps to utilize known shortest paths, ensuring that we are considering paths that cover all required sub-paths.

### Code

```python
import heapq
import sys
from collections import defaultdict

def dijkstra(n, edges, start):
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v, w in edges:
        graph[u].append((v, w))
        
    distances = [sys.maxsize] * n
    distances[start] = 0
    priority_queue = [(0, start)]  # (distance, node)
    
    while priority_queue:
        current_distance, current_node = heapq.heappop(priority_queue)
        
        if current_distance > distances[current_node]:
            continue
        
        for neighbor, weight in graph[current_node]:
            distance = current_distance + weight
            if distance < distances[neighbor]:
                distances[neighbor] = distance
                heapq.heappush(priority_queue, (distance, neighbor))
    
    return distances

def minimum_weighted_subgraph(n, edges, src1, src2, dst):
    dist_src1 = dijkstra(n, edges, src1)
    dist_src2 = dijkstra(n, edges, src2)
    
    reversed_edges = [(v, u, w) for u, v, w in edges]
    dist_dst = dijkstra(n, reversed_edges, dst)
    
    min_weight = sys.maxsize
    for i in range(n):
        if dist_src1[i] != sys.maxsize and dist_src2[i] != sys.maxsize and dist_dst[i] != sys.maxsize:
            total_distance = dist_src1[i] + dist_src2[i] + dist_dst[i]
            min_weight = min(min_weight, total_distance)
    
    return -1 if min_weight == sys.maxsize else min_weight

# Example usage:
n = 5
edges = [[0,1,1], [0,2,1], [1,3,3], [2,3,1], [1,4,1], [2,4,2], [3,4,1]]
src1 = 0
src2 = 2
dst = 4

print(minimum_weighted_subgraph(n, edges, src1, src2, dst))  # Output: Expected output based on the paths in the graph
```

### Time Complexity

- Running Dijkstra's algorithm on a graph with `n` nodes and `m` edges has a time complexity of `O((n + m) log n)`.
- Since we run Dijkstra's three times (from `src1`, `src2`, and `dst`), the total time complexity is `O(3 * (n + m) log n)` which is `O((n + m) log n)` because constants are omitted in Big-O notation.

This solution ensures that we consider all possible paths and find the one with the minimum weight that satisfies the given conditions.
