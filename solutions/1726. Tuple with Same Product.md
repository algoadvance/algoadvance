title:  Tuple with Same Product-out
permalink: /s1726

Given an array `nums` of distinct positive integers, return the number of tuples `(a, b, c, d)` such that `a * b = c * d` where `a, b, c,` and `d` are distinct elements from `nums`.

Example:
```
Input: nums = [2, 3, 4, 6]
Output: 8
Explanation: There are 8 valid tuples:
(2, 6, 3, 4)
(2, 6, 4, 3)
(6, 2, 3, 4)
(6, 2, 4, 3)
(3, 4, 2, 6)
(4, 3, 2, 6)
(3, 4, 6, 2)
(4, 3, 6, 2)
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are tuples like (a, b, c, d) and (c, d, a, b) considered identical or different?**
   - Answer: They are different as long as the elements are in different positions.

2. **Can we assume that the input list `nums` will contain at least 4 elements?**
   - Answer: Yes, otherwise, there can't be any tuples of size 4.

### Strategy
1. **Brute Force Approach:**
   - Compute all possible products of pairs (a, b).
   - Use nested loops to find pairs and check if their products match.
   - This approach is computationally expensive (O(n^4)) and infeasible for large inputs.

2. **Optimized Approach:**
   - Use a dictionary to store the products of pairs and their corresponding pairs.
   - Iterate through `nums` to compute products and store them.
   - For each pair product, if already seen, count combinations.

**Steps:**
1. Iterate through each pair `(i, j)` of the array `nums`.
2. Calculate `product = nums[i] * nums[j]`.
3. Use a dictionary to count how many times each product has been seen.
4. If a product is seen again, calculate the number of new valid tuples.

### Code
```python
from collections import defaultdict

def tupleSameProduct(nums):
    product_count = defaultdict(int)
    num_tuples = 0
    
    n = len(nums)
    
    # Step through each unique pair in nums
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            prod = nums[i] * nums[j]
            # If this product has been seen before with different pairs
            if prod in product_count:
                count = product_count[prod]
                # Each existing product pair creates 8 new tuples with the new pair
                num_tuples += 8 * count
            product_count[prod] += 1
    
    return num_tuples

# Example usage
nums = [2, 3, 4, 6]
print(tupleSameProduct(nums))  # Output should be 8
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of the optimized approach is **O(n^2)**:
  - Nested loops run in O(n^2) to calculate the products of pairs.
  - Dictionary operations (insert and lookup) are on average O(1).

This solution leverages a dictionary to efficiently count and check pair products, reducing the potential complexity from O(n^4) to O(n^2).
