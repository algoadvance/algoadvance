title:  Create Components With Same Value-out
permalink: /s2440
---

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Your task is to partition the array into components (subarrays) such that each component's sum is equal to `k`. The goal is to find the maximum number of components you can create that each sum to `k`. If it is not possible to create any components that sum to `k`, return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**: What is the range of values for `nums` and `k`? 
   - Let's assume `nums` can have both positive and negative integers, and its length can be up to 10^5.

2. **Constraints**: Are there any specific constraints on the sum of `nums` relative to `k`?
   - If the sum of `nums` is not a multiple of `k`, it is impossible to partition the array into components summing to `k`.

3. **Output**: What should be the output if no valid partitioning is possible?
   - The output should be `-1`.

4. **Edge Cases**: Are there edge cases such as empty arrays or arrays with all identical elements?
   - An empty array should return `-1` because there are no elements to partition.

## Strategy

1. **Initial Check**: First, check if the sum of the array is divisible by `k`. If it is not, it's impossible to partition the array as desired, and we should return `-1`.

2. **Iterate and Partition**: We will iterate through the array while maintaining a cumulative sum. Each time the cumulative sum reaches `k`, we increment the component count and reset the cumulative sum.

## Code

Here's the Python implementation for the given problem:

```python
def maxComponentsWithSameValue(nums, k):
    total_sum = sum(nums)
    
    # If total sum is not divisible by k, we can't partition the array as required.
    if total_sum % k != 0:
        return -1
    
    target_sum = k
    current_sum = 0
    component_count = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        current_sum += num
        if current_sum == target_sum:
            component_count += 1
            current_sum = 0
    
    return component_count if current_sum == 0 else -1

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 2, 3, 5, 2, 2, 1, 5]
k = 5
print(maxComponentsWithSameValue(nums, k))  # Output: 3 (Possible partitions: [2, 3], [5], [2, 3])
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the `nums` array. This is because we are iterating through the array exactly once to accumulate sums and count the components.
