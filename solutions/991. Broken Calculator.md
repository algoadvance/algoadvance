Given two integers `startValue` and `target`, you need to determine the minimum number of operations required to convert `startValue` to `target`. You can only use the following operations:

1. Multiply the number by 2.
2. Subtract 1 from the number.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are the integers `startValue` and `target` guaranteed to be positive?  
   **A:** Yes, both integers are positive.

2. **Q:** Is `startValue` always less than or equal to `target`?  
   **A:** No, `startValue` can be either less than, equal to, or greater than `target`.

3. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the maximum value of `startValue` and `target`?  
   **A:** The problem typically implies constraints within reasonable computational limits, often assuming values up to \(10^9\) or similar bounds commonly seen in algorithm problems.

### Strategy

To solve this problem with the minimum number of operations, we will work backwards from the `target` to the `startValue`. This works because we can invert the operations:
- Instead of multiplying by 2, we can divide by 2.
- Instead of subtracting 1, we can add 1.

By working backwards:
1. If `target` is greater than `startValue`:
   - If `target` is even, divide it by 2.
   - If `target` is odd, add 1 to make it even.
2. Continue this until `target` becomes less than or equal to `startValue`.
3. Finally, if `startValue` is still greater than the modified `target`, simply add the difference (since you decrement one-by-one operations) to your operation count.

### Code

Here's the Python code to implement the above strategy:

```python
def brokenCalc(startValue: int, target: int) -> int:
    operations = 0
    while target > startValue:
        if target % 2 == 0:
            target //= 2
        else:
            target += 1
        operations += 1
    
    # Now target is less than or equal to startValue
    # Simply add the difference because addition operation requires one step each
    return operations + (startValue - target)

# Example Usage
startValue = 3
target = 10
print(brokenCalc(startValue, target))  # Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of the provided approach is \(O(\log target)\). This is because in each iteration, when the `target` is even, we divide it by 2, effectively halving it. Thus, the number of operations is proportional to the logarithm of `target`.

### Explanation

- **Step-by-Step Execution**:
  - Start with `target`.
  - Keep reducing `target` by performing the operations in reverse until it is less than or equal to `startValue`.
  - If the target is even, divide by 2.
  - If the target is odd, add 1 to make it even, then continue.
  - Finally, if `startValue` is greater than the `target` (after it has been scaled down), add the difference to the number of operations counted during the halving phase.

This solution ensures that you are moving closer to `startValue` in the most efficient way possible, reducing the number of operations required.
