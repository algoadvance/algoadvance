Leetcode Problem 669: Trim a Binary Search Tree

Given the root of a binary search tree and the lowest and highest boundaries as low and high, trim the tree so that all its elements lie in `[low, high]`. Trimming the tree should **not** change the relative structure of the elements that will remain in the tree (i.e., any node's descendants should remain as descendants). It can be proved that there is a unique answer.

Return the root of the trimmed binary search tree. Note that the root may change depending on the given bounds.

### Example:
```python
Input: root = [1, 0, 2], low = 1, high = 2
Output: [1, null, 2]

Input: root = [3, 0, 4, null, 2, null, null, 1], low = 1, high = 3
Output: [3, 2, null, 1]
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Tree definition**: How is the tree structured in the input? Typically, it's provided as a list or TreeNode objects in real-use scenarios.
2. **Return type**: Do we return the modified tree's root node or an array representation of the tree? (Likely, the root node of the trimmed tree).

Assumptions based on standard BST and Leetcode conventions:
- We are to return the root of the trimmed binary search tree.
- The tree is provided using the `TreeNode` class definition.

Here's the typical `TreeNode` class definition:
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
```

## Strategy:
1. **Traverse the Tree**: We will perform a traversal of the tree and for each node, we:
    - Check if the current node is within the `[low, high]` range:
        - If it is, we recursively trim the left and right subtrees.
        - If it is not, we choose to traverse a specific subtree (left if current node value is greater than `high`, right if less than `low`).
2. **Recursive Function**: The function will modify the tree in place, ensuring nodes not within the range are removed and return the appropriately altered root.

## Code:
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def trimBST(root: TreeNode, low: int, high: int) -> TreeNode:
    if not root:
        return None
    
    if root.val < low:
        # Nodes from left subtree won't fall in the range
        return trimBST(root.right, low, high)
    
    if root.val > high:
        # Nodes from right subtree won't fall in the range
        return trimBST(root.left, low, high)
    
    # Node is within the range
    root.left = trimBST(root.left, low, high)
    root.right = trimBST(root.right, low, high)
    
    return root
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree, because in the worst case, we visit each node exactly once. The space complexity is `O(h)` where `h` is the height of the tree, considering the recursion stack space.

This recursive approach ensures that the tree is trimmed by directly addressing nodes only within the specified range `[low, high]`, maintaining the BST properties, and making efficient cuts to the left and right subtrees when necessary.
