title:  3Sum With Multiplicity-out
permalink: /s923
---
Given an integer array `arr`, and an integer `target`, return the number of tuples `(i, j, k)` such that `i < j < k` and `arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k] == target`.

Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be done if the array has fewer than three elements?**
   - The output should be 0 because it's impossible to form a triplet with fewer than three elements.
   
2. **Are the elements in the array distinct?**
   - No, there can be duplicate elements.

3. **Should we consider different orders of the same element combination as different tuples?**
   - No, the tuples are considered based on their indices (`i < j < k`).

### Strategy
1. **Handle Edge Case**: If the length of `arr` is less than 3, return 0.
2. **Use a Dictionary for Counting**: Compute the frequency of each number in `arr` using a Counter from the `collections` module.
3. **Iterate and Find Tuples**:
   - Use three nested loops to explore each possible combination of indices to find valid triplets.
   - For each combination, check if the sum equals the target.
   - Employ combinations and permutations mathematical logic to count tuples properly if there are duplicate values.

### Time Complexity
- The naive approach would involve iterating over all triplets, leading to a time complexity of \(O(n^3)\). We can optimize this using counting and ensuring the conditions for indices (`i < j < k`) directly.

### Code
```python
from collections import Counter
from itertools import combinations

def threeSumMulti(arr, target):
    counter = Counter(arr)
    keys = sorted(counter)  # Sort keys to ensure i < j < k
    
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    result = 0
    
    for i, x in enumerate(keys):
        for j, y in enumerate(keys[i:], start=i):  # y starts from x
            z = target - x - y
            if z in counter:
                if x == y == z:
                    # Combination (x, x, x)
                    if counter[x] >= 3:
                        result += counter[x] * (counter[x] - 1) * (counter[x] - 2) // 6
                elif x == y != z:
                    # Combination (x, x, z)
                    if counter[x] >= 2:
                        result += counter[x] * (counter[x] - 1) // 2 * counter[z]
                elif x < y < z:
                    # Combination (x, y, z)
                    result += counter[x] * counter[y] * counter[z]
                    
    return result % MOD

# Example usage
arr = [1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2]
target = 5
print(threeSumMulti(arr, target))  # Output: 12
```

This implementation leverages the combinatorial logic to ensure correct counting of valid triplets under the constraints of indices being in the correct order (`i < j < k`). The overall complexity of this approach is determined by the double loop over unique elements and the constant lookup operations in the Counter, leading to a more efficient computation when compared to the naive \(O(n^3)\) approach.
