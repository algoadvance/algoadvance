title:  Minimum Swaps to Make Strings Equal-out
permalink: /s1247
---

You are given two strings `s1` and `s2` of equal length consisting of characters `'x'` and `'y'` only. Your task is to make these two strings equal to each other. You can swap any two characters in `s1` or `s2`. Return the minimum number of swaps required to make the strings equal. If it is impossible to do so, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the length of `s1` and `s2`?**
   - Typically, in problems like this, the length can go up to 10^5.

2. **What constitutes a swap?**
   - A swap means exchanging any two characters from different indices in either string.

3. **Can swaps be performed between the strings?**
   - No, swaps can only occur within `s1` or `s2`.

4. **Are the strings guaranteed to be of the same length?**
   - Yes, the problem states they are of equal length.

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We need to identify mismatches between `s1` and `s2`. There are two types of mismatches: `(x, y)` and `(y, x)`.
   - To make the strings equal, these mismatches need to be resolved.

2. **Observation:**
   - Mismatch `(x, y)` in positions `s1[i]` and `s2[i]` can be paired with mismatch `(y, x)` in another position for resolution.
   - Two mismatches of the same type `(x, y)` or `(y, x)` can be resolved in two swaps: one within `s1` and one within `s2`.

3. **Steps:**
   - Count the number of `(x, y)` mismatches and the number of `(y, x)` mismatches.
   - If the total number of mismatches is odd, it is impossible to make the strings equal, return `-1`.
   - The total number of swaps needed would be half of the sum of mismatches of each type.

### Implementation

```python
def minimumSwap(s1: str, s2: str) -> int:
    if len(s1) != len(s2):
        return -1
    
    # Counts for the mismatches
    xy_count = 0
    yx_count = 0
    
    for char1, char2 in zip(s1, s2):
        if char1 == 'x' and char2 == 'y':
            xy_count += 1
        elif char1 == 'y' and char2 == 'x':
            yx_count += 1
    
    # If the total number of mismatches is odd, return -1 (impossible)
    if (xy_count + yx_count) % 2 != 0:
        return -1
    
    # Calculate the swaps needed
    swaps = xy_count // 2 + yx_count // 2
    
    # If there is one pair of leftovers (one xy and one yx mismatches both in single count)
    if xy_count % 2 == 1:
        swaps += 2
    
    return swaps
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the strings. We only need to traverse each string once to count mismatches.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` additional space, as we only use a few integer counters.

This solution efficiently counts and organizes swaps required to make the two strings equal and ensures optimal swapping.
