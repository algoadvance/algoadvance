title:  Rotate Image-out
permalink: /s48

You are given an `n x n` 2D matrix representing an image. Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. **Do not** allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

### Example 1:
```
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[7,4,1],[8,5,2],[9,6,3]]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: matrix = [[5,1,9,11],[2,4,8,10],[13,3,6,7],[15,14,12,16]]
Output: [[15,13,2,5],[14,3,4,1],[12,6,8,9],[16,7,10,11]]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can you confirm the constraints on `n`? Is there a minimum or maximum size for the matrix?
2. Is it guaranteed that the matrix contains only integers?
   
## Strategy
To solve the problem in-place, we can utilize the following steps:
1. **Transpose the Matrix:** Convert all rows to columns.
2. **Reverse each Row:** Reverse the individual rows to achieve the desired 90-degree clockwise rotation.

### Steps:
1. **Transpose:** Swap `matrix[i][j]` with `matrix[j][i]` for all i < j.
2. **Reverse Rows:** Reverse each row individually.

Here's the code that implements the above approach:

## Code
```python
def rotate(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    
    # Transpose the matrix
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            matrix[i][j], matrix[j][i] = matrix[j][i], matrix[i][j]
    
    # Reverse each row
    for i in range(n):
        matrix[i].reverse()

# Test example
matrix1 = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
rotate(matrix1)
print(matrix1)  # Output: [[7, 4, 1], [8, 5, 2], [9, 6, 3]]

matrix2 = [[5, 1, 9, 11], [2, 4, 8, 10], [13, 3, 6, 7], [15, 14, 12, 16]]
rotate(matrix2)
print(matrix2)  # Output: [[15, 13, 2, 5], [14, 3, 4, 1], [12, 6, 8, 9], [16, 7, 10, 11]]
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(n^2)` because:
1. Transposing the matrix involves iterating over each element above the diagonal once, which takes `O(n^2/2)` = `O(n^2)`.
2. Reversing each row is `O(n)` for each row, leading to an additional `O(n^2)` for `n` rows.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n^2)`.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is `O(1)` since we are rotating the matrix in-place and not using any extra space apart from variables.
