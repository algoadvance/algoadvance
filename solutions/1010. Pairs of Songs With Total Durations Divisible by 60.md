title:  Pairs of Songs With Total Durations Divisible by 60-out
permalink: /s1010

Given a list of song durations (in seconds), return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by 60.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of the length of the list `time`?
   - What is the range of the values in the list `time`?

2. **Output:**
   - Should there be an output of the pairs or just the count of such pairs?

Assuming the constraints are as follows:
- The length of the list `time` is between 1 and 10^6.
- Each duration in `time` is between 1 and 500.

We'll proceed with understanding that we need to return the count of such pairs.

### Strategy

1. **Modulo Operation:** 
   - For a pair of song durations `a` and `b` to be divisible by 60, `(a + b) % 60` should be 0. This means `a % 60 + b % 60` should also be 0 or 60.

2. **Frequency Array:**
   - Use an array `remainder` of size 60 to count the number of times each remainder (`time % 60`) appears.

3. **Count the Pairs:**
   - For each unique remainder `r` in the range [1, 30), count how many times the remainder 60 - r appears.
   - For `r` equals 0 and 30, handle these remainders separately since these require pairing within their group.

### Code

```python
def numPairsDivisibleBy60(time):
    # Frequency array for remainder counts
    remainder = [0] * 60
    count = 0

    for t in time:
        rem = t % 60
        
        # If remainder is 0, we're looking for other songs already recorded with remainder 0
        if rem == 0:
            count += remainder[0]
        else:
            # We're looking for a song that has a remainder of 60 - rem
            count += remainder[60 - rem]
        
        # Record this song's remainder
        remainder[rem] += 1
        
    return count

# Example usage
time = [30, 20, 150, 100, 40]
print(numPairsDivisibleBy60(time))  # Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where `n` is the number of songs. We traverse the list once to compute the count of pairs.
- **Space Complexity:** O(60) â‰ˆ O(1) since the frequency array size is constant regardless of the input size.

This solution efficiently calculates the pairs of songs with a total duration divisible by 60 using a linear pass and constant space.
