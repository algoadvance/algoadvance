title:  Find a Good Subset of the Matrix-out
permalink: /s2732
---
You are given a `1`-indexed `m x n` binary matrix `mat`, where `mat[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.

A subset of rows `S` is good if:

- Every row in `S` contains the same number of `0`s as `1`s.
- `S` is not empty.

Return the largest good subset as a list of row indices. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

**Example 1:**

*Input:*
```plaintext
mat = [[1, 0, 1], 
       [1, 0, 0], 
       [1, 1, 0], 
       [0, 1, 1]]
```
*Output:*
```plaintext
[1, 4]
```

In the example above, the good subset is `[1, 4]` since `mat[1]` and `mat[4]` each have equal numbers of `0s` and `1s`.

**Example 2:**

*Input:*
```plaintext
mat = [[1, 1, 0], 
       [0, 0, 1], 
       [1, 0, 1]]
```
*Output:*
```plaintext
[2, 3]
```

Again, this subset `[2, 3]` is good because each row has equal numbers of `0s` and `1s`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the matrix contain non-binary values?
   - No, the matrix is strictly binary (0 or 1).
2. Is the matrix guaranteed to have rows with an equal number of `0`s and `1`s?
   - No, and in this case, the result should be an empty list.
3. Are we guaranteed to have at least one row in the matrix?
   - Yes, the matrix will have at least one row.

## Strategy
To solve the problem, we need to find subsets of rows where each row in the subset has an equal number of `0`s and `1`s:

1. Iterate through each row and count the number of `0`s and `1`s.
2. If the number of `0`s equals the number of `1`s, add the index of this row to the subset.
3. Return the largest subset found which satisfies the condition.

## Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def find_good_subset(mat):
    good_rows = []
    
    for i in range(len(mat)):
        row = mat[i]
        num_zeros = row.count(0)
        num_ones = row.count(1)
        
        if num_zeros == num_ones:
            good_rows.append(i + 1)  # +1 to convert to 1-indexed
    
    return good_rows

# Example 1
mat1 = [[1, 0, 1], 
        [1, 0, 0], 
        [1, 1, 0], 
        [0, 1, 1]]

print(find_good_subset(mat1))  # Output: [1, 4]

# Example 2
mat2 = [[1, 1, 0], 
        [0, 0, 1], 
        [1, 0, 1]]

print(find_good_subset(mat2))  # Output: [2, 3]
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. This is because we iterate through each of the `m` rows, and for each row, we count the number of `0`s and `1`s in O(n) time.
