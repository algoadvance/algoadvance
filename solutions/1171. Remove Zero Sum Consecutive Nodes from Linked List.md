title:  Remove Zero Sum Consecutive Nodes from Linked List-out
permalink: /s1171
---
Given the head of a linked list, we need to remove all consecutive nodes that sum to zero. After removing such nodes, we need to return the head of the modified linked list.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the list contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the nodes can have any integer values.
2. **Should we consider empty lists or lists with no zero-sum sublists?**
   - Yes, if the list is empty or if there are no zero-sum sublists, we simply return the original list (or `None` if empty).
3. **Is the input list guaranteed to be valid?**
   - Yes, we can assume that the input list is a valid singly linked list.

### Strategy
1. **Using a Prefix Sum and HashMap:**
   - We'll maintain a prefix sum while traversing the linked list.
   - Use a hashmap (or dictionary) to store the first occurrence of each prefix sum.
   - If the same prefix sum appears again, it indicates that the nodes between these two occurrences sum to zero.
   - Adjust pointers to skip the zero-sum consecutive nodes.

### Code

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def removeZeroSumSublists(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    # Dummy node to handle edge cases where head needs to be removed
    dummy = ListNode(0)
    dummy.next = head
    
    # Dictionary to store the prefix sums
    prefix_sum_to_node = {}
    
    # Initialize prefix sum
    current_sum = 0
    current = dummy
    
    # First pass to record the last occurrence of each prefix sum
    while current:
        current_sum += current.val
        prefix_sum_to_node[current_sum] = current
        current = current.next
        
    # Reset for second pass
    current_sum = 0
    current = dummy
    
    # Second pass to remove zero-sum sublists
    while current:
        current_sum += current.val
        # Skip nodes sum to zero
        current.next = prefix_sum_to_node[current_sum].next
        current = current.next
    
    return dummy.next
```

### Explanation
1. **Dummy Node:**
   - We use a dummy node to simplify edge case handling, such as removing the head node.
   
2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - We calculate the prefix sum of the nodes and store the latest node for each prefix sum in the dictionary.
   
3. **Two Passes:**
   - **First Pass:** Build the hashmap with prefix sums.
   - **Second Pass:** Modify the next pointers to skip zero-sum sublists using the hashmap.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because we traverse the linked list twice: once to build the hashmap and once to adjust the pointers.

- The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) due to the storage of prefix sums in the hashmap.
