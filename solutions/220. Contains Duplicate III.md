Given an integer array `nums` and two integers `k` and `t`, return `true` if there are two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the array such that `abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= t` and `abs(i - j) <= k`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of values for `k` and `t`? 
   - What is the range of elements in the `nums` array?
   - What is the maximum length of the `nums` array?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should be returned if `nums` has fewer than 2 elements?
   - How to handle if `k` is 0? 
   - Any specific requirements for the data types?

Based on typical problem constraints for LeetCode:
- `nums.length` can be up to 10^4.
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- `0 <= k <= 10^4`
- `0 <= t <= 2^31 - 1`

Given these constraints, it's crucial to think about an efficient solution because a brute-force approach will not be feasible for larger inputs.

## Strategy

To achieve the required in a time-efficient manner, a sliding window approach with a data structure that supports fast queries to find if there is any number in the range needed is used. Specifically:

1. Use a `SortedList` to maintain a window of the last `k` elements.
2. For each element `nums[i]`, we check the `SortedList` for elements within the range `[nums[i] - t, nums[i] + t]`.
3. If such an element exists, we return `true`.
4. Insert the current element into `SortedList`.
5. Ensure window size by removing the element `nums[i - k]` when `i` is greater or equal to `k`.

We use `SortedList` from the `sortedcontainers` module, which provides efficient insertion, deletion, and look-up operations.

## Code

```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedList

def containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(nums, k, t):
    if not nums or k <= 0 or t < 0:
        return False
    
    window = SortedList()
    
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        # Find the index of the smallest number >= nums[i] - t
        if window:
            pos1 = window.bisect_left(nums[i] - t)
            # Check if there is a number in the window within the range
            if pos1 < len(window) and abs(window[pos1] - nums[i]) <= t:
                return True
        
        # Add current element to the window
        window.add(nums[i])
        
        # Maintain the window of size k
        if len(window) > k:
            window.remove(nums[i - k])

    return False
```

## Time Complexity
- **Insertion and Deletion:** O(log k) due to use of `SortedList`.
- **Lookup (bisect_left):** O(log k).
- In the worst case, we perform the above operations for each of the `n` elements.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n log k)**.

This is a balanced solution that provides the efficiency required while keeping the implementation manageable.
