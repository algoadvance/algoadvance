title:  Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor-out
permalink: /s1026
---
Given the root of a binary tree, find the maximum value `v` for which there exist different nodes `a` and `b` where `v = |a.val - b.val|` and `a` is an ancestor of `b`.

A node `a` is an ancestor of `b` if either: any child of `a` is equal to `b` or any child of `a` is an ancestor of `b`.

*Example:*

```
Input: [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]
Output: 7
Explanation: 
We have various ancestor-node differences, some of which are:
|8-3| = 5
|3-1| = 2
|8-1| = 7
...
In this case, maximum difference is 7.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: How do we input the tree?**
   A: The tree is given in level-order representation.

2. **Q: Can the tree contain negative integers?**
   A: Typically, yes, nodes can contain negative values.

3. **Q: What is the size of the tree?**
   A: There is no explicit constraint given, but assume typical constraints such as up to thousands of nodes.

### Strategy
We need to traverse the tree and keep track of the minimum and maximum values we have seen along the path from the root to each node. The difference between the maximum and minimum values on any path will give the highest difference between an ancestor and a descendant.

We'll use Depth First Search (DFS) to explore each path. For each node, we'll compute the maximum difference using the current path's minimum and maximum values and recursively pass updated values to the child nodes.

### Code

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def maxAncestorDiff(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        def dfs(node, curr_min, curr_max):
            if not node:
                return curr_max - curr_min
            
            curr_min = min(curr_min, node.val)
            curr_max = max(curr_max, node.val)
            
            left_diff = dfs(node.left, curr_min, curr_max)
            right_diff = dfs(node.right, curr_min, curr_max)
            
            return max(left_diff, right_diff)
        
        if not root:
            return 0
        
        return dfs(root, root.val, root.val)

# Example usage
# Constructing the tree: [8,3,10,1,6,null,14,null,null,4,7,13]
root = TreeNode(8)
root.left = TreeNode(3)
root.right = TreeNode(10)
root.left.left = TreeNode(1)
root.left.right = TreeNode(6)
root.left.right.left = TreeNode(4)
root.left.right.right = TreeNode(7)
root.right.right = TreeNode(14)
root.right.right.left = TreeNode(13)

sol = Solution()
print(sol.maxAncestorDiff(root))  # Output: 7
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node is visited exactly once during the DFS traversal.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity of this solution is \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree. This is the space used by the call stack during the DFS traversal. In the worst case of a skewed tree, this could be \(O(n)\).
