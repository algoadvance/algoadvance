title:  Kth Smallest Element in a BST-out
permalink: /s230
---

Given the `root` of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer `k`, return the `kth` smallest element in the tree.

### Example:
```
Input: root = [3,1,4,null,2], k = 1
Output: 1

Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,null,1], k = 3
Output: 3
```

### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is `n`.
- 1 <= k <= n <= 10^4
- 0 <= Node.val <= 10^4

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the k value always valid?** 
   - Yes, it is guaranteed that 1 <= k <= n, where n is the number of nodes in the BST.
2. **Is the BST valid without any duplicate values?**
   - Yes, by definition BST should not have duplicate values.

## Strategy

1. **Inorder Traversal:**
   - The most straightforward way to solve this problem is through inorder traversal of the BST. Inorder traversal of a BST gives nodes in non-decreasing order.
   - We can keep a counter while traversing to keep track of the number of nodes visited.
   - Once we have visited `k` nodes, the `kth` node's value is the `kth` smallest element.

2. **Algorithm:**
   - Perform an `inorder` traversal (Left, Root, Right).
   - Use a stack to iteratively traverse the tree.
   - Keep a count of nodes visited.
   - Return the value of the node when the count equals `k`.

3. **Time Complexity:**
   - The solution will have a time complexity of O(H + k), where H is the height of the tree. This is because we might have to traverse the height of the tree to get to the leftmost node and then traverse `k` nodes.

## Code

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def kthSmallest(root: TreeNode, k: int) -> int:
    stack = []
    current = root
    count = 0
    
    # Inorder traversal loop
    while stack or current:
        # Reach the left most Node of the current Node
        while current:
            stack.append(current)
            current = current.left
        
        # current must be None at this point
        current = stack.pop()
        count += 1
        
        # If count is equal to k, return the current node's value
        if count == k:
            return current.val
            
        # Move to the right subtree
        current = current.right

# Example Usage:
# Let's create a test tree [3,1,4,null,2]
#       3
#      / \
#     1   4
#      \
#       2

root = TreeNode(3)
root.left = TreeNode(1)
root.right = TreeNode(4)
root.left.right = TreeNode(2)

k = 1
print(kthSmallest(root, k))  # Output: 1
```

**Explanation:**
- A stack is used to simulate the inorder traversal iteratively.
- The outer while loop runs until there are nodes left to process.
- The inner while loop processes all the left nodes of the current subtree.
- Nodes are popped from the stack and processed, and the right subtree is then processed.
- The `count` variable ensures that we stop and return the `kth` node's value.

This approach ensures we efficiently find the `kth` smallest element without the need for additional space beyond the recursion stack or maintaining a separate sorted list of elements.
