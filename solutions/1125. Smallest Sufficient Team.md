You are given a list of people, where `people[i]` is a list of skills that the i-th person has. Consider a company that needs to have all the required skills to work on a project. The project requires a list of `req_skills`, and you need to form a team with the smallest number of people that can cover all the required skills.

Return a list of the indices of the people in the smallest sufficient team. It's guaranteed that there is always a sufficient team.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can a person have more than one skill?**
   - Yes, a person can have multiple skills.
2. **Can the required skills set and each personâ€™s skills have overlapping elements?**
   - Yes, the `req_skills` list and each `people[i]` can have overlapping skills.
3. **Is it guaranteed that there is always a solution?**
   - Yes, it is guaranteed that there is always a sufficient team.

### Strategy:

To solve the problem efficiently, we can use Dynamic Programming with bit manipulation. The idea is to represent the required skills and the skills of each person as bitmasks which makes it easier to determine the contribution of each person to the overall skillset.

1. **Bitmask Representation**: 
   Represent each set of skills using bitmasks where each bit position corresponds to a skill. This allows us to quickly check which skills are covered by combining bitmasks using bitwise OR operations.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: 
   Use a dynamic programming table where each entry `dp[mask]` represents the smallest sufficient team that can cover the skill set represented by `mask`. We initialize `dp[0]` with an empty team since no skills are required.

3. **Updating the DP Table**:
   For each person, update the DP table by considering all current states and forming new states with the person's skills added. This involves combining the current team with the new person's skills and checking if the new team is smaller.

4. **Optimal Solution**: 
   The final answer will be the team in `dp[(1 << n) - 1]`, where `n` is the number of required skills, and `(1 << n) - 1` represents the bitmask with all skills covered.

### Code:

```python
def smallestSufficientTeam(req_skills, people):
    n = len(req_skills)
    m = len(people)
    
    # Create a skill to bitmask index mapping
    skill_index = {skill: i for i, skill in enumerate(req_skills)}
    
    # DP array to store the smallest sufficient team for each skill combination
    dp = {0: []}
    
    for i, person in enumerate(people):
        person_skill_mask = 0
        for skill in person:
            if skill in skill_index:
                person_skill_mask |= 1 << skill_index[skill]
        
        # Update the DP table
        new_dp = dp.copy()
        for skill_set, team in dp.items():
            combined_skills = skill_set | person_skill_mask
            if combined_skills == skill_set:
                continue
            if combined_skills not in new_dp or len(new_dp[combined_skills]) > len(team) + 1:
                new_dp[combined_skills] = team + [i]
        dp = new_dp
    
    return dp[(1 << n) - 1]

# Example usage:
req_skills = ["java", "nodejs", "reactjs"]
people = [["java"], ["nodejs"], ["nodejs", "reactjs"]]
print(smallestSufficientTeam(req_skills, people))  # Output: [0, 2]
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Bitmask Operations**: Each bitmask operation is O(1) given the number of required skills are reasonably small.
- **Dynamic Programming Update**: We iterate over the people and for each person, we may have to update up to `2^n` entries in the worst case.

Considering these, the overall time complexity is O(m * 2^n), where `m` is the number of people and `n` is the number of required skills. This is efficient given that `m` is typically much larger than `n`.
