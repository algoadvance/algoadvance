title:  Maximum Xor Product-out
permalink: /s2939
---

Given a list of non-negative integers `nums`, you need to compute the maximum XOR product of any two distinct numbers from the list and return the resultant value.

The XOR operation, represented by `^`, operates bitwise and returns a number that has a bit set to `1` if the corresponding bits of the operands are different.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: Can the list contain duplicate numbers?**
   - A: Yes, the list can contain duplicate numbers, but for the purpose of finding the XOR product, each occurrence is treated as a distinct entity.

2. **Q: What should be the behavior if the list contains fewer than two elements?**
   - A: Since we need at least two distinct numbers to perform the XOR operation, if the list has fewer than two elements, the problem constraints should guarantee this won't be the case, or we could return an appropriate output like `0` or handle it via an exception.

3. **Q: Whatâ€™s the maximum length of the input list?**
   - A: This information is generally given in problem constraints, but for typical problems on platforms like LeetCode, let's assume the number can be up to \(10^5\).

### Strategy

1. **Brute-Force Approach**:
   - Iterate through all pairs of numbers in the list and calculate their XOR.
   - Track the maximum XOR found.
   - This approach has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\).

2. **Optimized Approach**:
   - Leverage a Trie to perform the XOR calculation more efficiently.
   - Insert each number into the Trie, and for each number, find the maximum XOR it can form with numbers already in the Trie.
   - This reduces the lookup time and insertion to \(O(32n)\) (32 is from the number of bits in the binary representation of the numbers).

### Code Implementation

Here's how you would implement it:

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.value = None

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()
    
    def insert(self, num):
        node = self.root
        for bit in bin(num)[2:].zfill(32):  # Convert num to 32-bit binary
            if bit not in node.children:
                node.children[bit] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[bit]
        node.value = num
    
    def find_max_xor(self, num):
        node = self.root
        xor_num = 0
        for bit in bin(num)[2:].zfill(32):
            toggled_bit = '1' if bit == '0' else '0'
            if toggled_bit in node.children:
                xor_num = (xor_num << 1) | 1
                node = node.children[toggled_bit]
            else:
                xor_num = (xor_num << 1)
                node = node.children.get(bit, node)
        return xor_num


def find_maximum_xor(nums):
    if len(nums) < 2:
        return 0

    trie = Trie()
    max_xor = float('-inf')
    
    for num in nums:
        trie.insert(num)
    
    for num in nums:
        max_xor = max(max_xor, trie.find_max_xor(num))
    
    return max_xor

# Example usage:
nums = [3, 10, 5, 25, 2, 8]
print(find_maximum_xor(nums))  # Output: 28
```

### Time Complexity

- **Insertion Time Complexity**: Each `insert` takes \(O(32)\), and we do this for `n` numbers. So, \(O(32n)\).
- **XOR Calculation Time Complexity**: For each number, the `find_max_xor` operation also takes \(O(32)\), and we do this for `n` numbers. So, \(O(32n)\).

The total time complexity is \(O(n)\) considering the fixed constant related to the 32-bit integer representation.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity primarily comes from storing the Trie. In the worst case, the space complexity could go up to \(O(n \cdot 32)\) for the Trie nodes. Because each number can require up to 32 levels in the Trie, and there may be as many distinct paths as there are numbers.
