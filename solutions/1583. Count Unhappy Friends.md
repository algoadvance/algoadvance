title:  Count Unhappy Friends-out
permalink: /s1583
---

You are given a list of friends' preferences for certain friends and a list of pairs of friends who've been paired together. A friend `x` is unhappy if `x` prefers another friend `u` over their pair `y`, and `u` prefers `x` over their pair `v`. Your goal is to count the number of unhappy friends.

Here are the specific conditions:
- `preferences[i]` is a list of friends sorted in the order of preferences for friend `i`.
- `pairs[j]` is a list containing two friends paired together `pairs[j] = [x, y]`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Is it guaranteed that each friend will appear exactly once in the `pairs` list?
2. Can friends' preferences have duplicate friends, or are they unique?
3. What should be the output if there are no unhappy friends?
4. Can the input list `preferences` or `pairs` be empty?

## Code

```python
def countUnhappyFriends(n, preferences, pairs):
    pair_dict = {}
    for x, y in pairs:
        pair_dict[x] = y
        pair_dict[y] = x
    
    # To store the preferences in terms of better preferences
    preference_rank = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n):
        for rank, j in enumerate(preferences[i]):
            preference_rank[i][j] = rank
    
    unhappy_count = 0
    for x in range(n):
        y = pair_dict[x]
        for u in preferences[x][:preference_rank[x][y]]:
            v = pair_dict[u]
            if preference_rank[u][x] < preference_rank[u][v]:
                unhappy_count += 1
                break

    return unhappy_count

# Example Usage
n = 4
preferences = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [3, 2, 0],
    [3, 1, 0],
    [1, 2, 0]
]
pairs = [
    [0, 1],
    [2, 3]
]

print(countUnhappyFriends(n, preferences, pairs))  # Output: 2
```

## Strategy

1. **Pair Mapping**: Create a dictionary to map each friend to their pair for quick lookup.
2. **Preference Ranking**: Create a 2D array `preference_rank` where `preference_rank[i][j]` gives the rank of friend `j` in friend `i`'s preference list. This allows O(1) time complexity checks for preference comparison.
3. **Unhappy Friend Check**: For each friend `x`, iterate over their preferences until their pair `y`. For each such `u` that `x` prefers over `y`, if `u` also prefers `x` over their current pair `v`, mark `x` as unhappy. Update a counter each time an unhappy friend is found.

## Time Complexity

- **Pair Mapping**: O(n), where `n` is the number of friends.
- **Preference Ranking**: O(n^2) for constructing the `preference_rank` matrix.
- **Unhappy Friend Check**: O(n^2) since for each friend you potentially need to check all others up to their pair.

Overall, the solution has a time complexity of O(n^2).

The space complexity is also O(n^2) due to the `preference_rank` matrix.
