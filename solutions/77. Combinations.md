Given two integers `n` and `k`, return all possible combinations of `k` numbers out of the range `[1, n]`.

You may return the answer in any order.

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 4, k = 2
Output: 
[
  [2,4],
  [3,4],
  [2,3],
  [1,2],
  [1,3],
  [1,4],
]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 1, k = 1
Output: 
[
  [1]
]
```

### Constraints

1. `1 <= n <= 20`
2. `1 <= k <= n`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can `n` and `k` ever be negative or zero?  
   - No, according to the constraints, `n` and `k` will be positive integers within the given range.

2. Do the elements within each combination need to be in any particular order?
   - Yes, the combination should be in ascending order, naturally implied by the problem (numeric nature).

## Strategy

1. We need to generate all possible combinations. A combination is a selection of items without considering the order.
2. We can use backtracking to generate all the possible combinations.
   - Start with an empty list for the current combination.
   - Iterate from the current start point to `n`.
   - For each number, add it to the current combination and recurse with the next number.
   - If the combination size is `k`, add it to the result list.
   - Backtrack by removing the last added number.
3. Utilize depth-first search (DFS) with backtracking to explore all potential combinations.

## Code

Hereâ€™s the implementation using the above strategy:

```python
def combine(n: int, k: int):
    def backtrack(start, comb):
        # If the combination is complete
        if len(comb) == k:
            result.append(list(comb))  # Add a copy of comb
            return
        
        for i in range(start, n + 1):
            # Add i into the current combination
            comb.append(i)
            # Use next integers to complete the combination
            backtrack(i + 1, comb)
            # Backtrack by removing the last added number
            comb.pop()
    
    result = []
    backtrack(1, [])
    return result

# Example usage:
print(combine(4, 2))  # Outputs the combinations
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of generating combinations can be understood as follows:
- There are `C(n, k)` combinations, which is the number of ways to choose `k` elements from `n` elements without regarding the order.
- Therefore, the time complexity is `O(C(n, k) * k)` because for each combination, it takes linear time, `k`, to process it (adding to results and so forth).

For space complexity, we store all the combinations and also use recursive calls:
- Space complexity is `O(C(n, k) * k)` for storing the results.

This makes the approach efficient and feasible given the problem's constraints of `n` up to 20.
