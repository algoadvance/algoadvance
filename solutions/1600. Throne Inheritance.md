### Problem Statement

You are tasked with implementing a throne inheritance system for a kingdom. The system should support the following operations:

1. `birth(parentName, childName)`: Indicates that `parentName` has given birth to `childName`.
2. `death(name)`: Marks `name` as deceased. Deceased individuals should not appear in the order of succession.
3. `getInheritanceOrder()`: Returns the current order of succession excluding the deceased.

The order of succession follows these rules:

1. The current king is always at the head of the list.
2. Children inherit in the order of their birth (first-born has precedence over next-born, and so on).
3. If a member has children, they and their descendants inherit before younger siblings.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the king always given at the start, or should we assume a dynamic starting point?**

    - Assume the king's name is given during the initialization of the inheritance system.
  
2. **Is `death` reversible?**

    - Assume once a member is marked as deceased, this cannot be undone.

3. **Are characters' names unique?**

    - Assume all names are unique within the context of the inheritance system.

### Code

Let's provide a Python class `ThroneInheritance` that maintains the inheritance order based on the described rules.

### Strategy

1. Use a dictionary to store each person's children.
2. Use a set to keep track of deceased persons.
3. During `getInheritanceOrder`, perform a depth-first search (DFS) to construct the correct order excluding the deceased.

```python
class ThroneInheritance:
    def __init__(self, kingName: str):
        self.king = kingName
        self.family_tree = {kingName: []}  # A dictionary to keep track of children
        self.deceased = set()              # A set to track deceased members

    def birth(self, parentName: str, childName: str) -> None:
        if parentName in self.family_tree:
            self.family_tree[parentName].append(childName)
        else:
            self.family_tree[parentName] = [childName]
        self.family_tree[childName] = []

    def death(self, name: str) -> None:
        self.deceased.add(name)

    def getInheritanceOrder(self) -> list:
        inheritance_order = []
        
        def dfs(person):
            if person not in self.deceased:
                inheritance_order.append(person)
            for child in self.family_tree.get(person, []):
                dfs(child)
        
        dfs(self.king)
        return inheritance_order

# Example usage:
kingdom = ThroneInheritance("king")
kingdom.birth("king", "andy")
kingdom.birth("king", "bob")
kingdom.birth("king", "catherine")
kingdom.birth("andy", "matthew")
kingdom.birth("bob", "alex")
kingdom.birth("bob", "asha")

print(kingdom.getInheritanceOrder())
kingdom.death("bob")
print(kingdom.getInheritanceOrder())
```

### Time Complexity

- **Birth**: O(1) - Adding a child to a parentâ€™s list.
- **Death**: O(1) - Adding a name to the set of deceased individuals.
- **GetInheritanceOrder**: O(N) where N is the total number of family members (alive and deceased). This is because in the worst-case scenario, we may need to perform a DFS traversal covering all nodes.

This solution ensures efficient management of the throne succession while accurately reflecting the rules defined in the problem statement.
