You are given an initially empty string `s`. You are supposed to perform exactly `n` operations to obtain a string that contains only the letter 'A'. Initially, you can only perform the following operations:
1. Copy All: You can copy all the characters present in the notepad (initially empty) and store it in the clipboard.
2. Paste: You can paste the characters present in the clipboard on the notepad.

You need to return the minimum number of operations required to get exactly `n` 'A' characters on the notepad.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the initial state of the notepad and clipboard?**
   - The notepad starts empty and the clipboard starts empty.
   
2. **What counts as an operation?**
   - Either a "Copy All" or a "Paste" operation counts as one step.

3. **Is `n` guaranteed to be a positive integer?**
   - Yes, `n` is always a positive integer.

4. **Are there any constraints on `n`?**
   - Typically, `n` would be a moderate value for an interview problem.

## Strategy
To minimize the operations needed, we need to find the optimal sequence of Copy and Paste operations. One approach is to recognize that if we are dealing with a composite number of copies:
- We can break down the task of achieving `n` 'A's by finding the smallest factors.
- For each factor, we multiply the minimal steps needed to achieve the factor subproblem and add this to our running total of operations.

For a given `n`, if we can decompose it into smaller steps using its factors, we can iteratively compute the operations required for each factor until we achieve exactly `n` 'A's.

## Code
Here's the Python code to implement this strategy:
```python
def minSteps(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    
    def min_operations_to_get(factor):
        steps = 0
        divisor = 2
        while factor > 1:
            while factor % divisor == 0:
                steps += divisor
                factor //= divisor
            divisor += 1
        return steps

    return min_operations_to_get(n)

# Example usage
print(minSteps(3)) # returns 3
print(minSteps(7)) # returns 7
print(minSteps(12)) # returns 7 (2 copy+paste for 4, plus 3 copy+paste for 3)
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is decent for reasonable values of `n`, specifically it involves the factorization process which is `O(n log log n)` in practice due to the divisor increment and modulo operations. For most practical values of `n`, this is efficient.
  
The algorithm leverages prime factorization to find the minimum steps by breaking the problem into smaller sub-problems of finding the steps required to create factors of `n`.
