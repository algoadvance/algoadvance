title:  Minimum Elements to Add to Form a Given Sum-out
permalink: /s1785
---
You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `limit` and `goal`. The array `nums` has an initial sum. We want to ensure that the sum of the array always equals `goal`. To achieve this, you can add some numbers to the array. However, any added number must be between `-limit` and `limit` (both inclusive).

Return the minimum number of elements you need to add to make the sum of the array equal to `goal`.

## Example
**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,-1,1], limit = 3, goal = -4
Output: 2
Explanation: You can add -3 and -3, the sum of the array will be -4.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,-10,9,1], limit = 100, goal = 0
Output: 1
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the added elements restricted to integers?**
   - Yes, the added elements must be integers.
   
2. **Can the `nums` array be empty?**
   - Yes, the array can be empty, in which case we need to calculate additions solely based on the `goal`.

3. **Is there a constraint on the size of the array?**
   - We should assume typical constraints as found in competitive programming unless otherwise stated.

4. **Can the initial sum of `nums` and `goal` be negative?**
   - Yes, both can be negative.

## Strategy
1. Calculate the sum of the given array `nums`.
2. Determine the difference `diff` between the goal and the current sum of `nums`.
3. The maximum absolute value of any number that can be added is limited by `limit`.
4. To find the minimum number of elements to add:
   - Divide the absolute value of `diff` by `limit`.
   - If the division is not exact (i.e., there's a remainder), we need one additional number to cover the remainder.
5. Return the computed number of additions.

## Code

```python
def minElements(nums, limit, goal):
    # Calculate the current sum of the array
    current_sum = sum(nums)
    
    # Calculate difference needed to reach the goal
    diff = abs(goal - current_sum)
    
    # Calculate the minimum number of elements to add
    num_elements = diff // limit
    if diff % limit != 0:
        num_elements += 1
    
    return num_elements

# Example Tests
print(minElements([1, -1, 1], 3, -4))  # Output: 2
print(minElements([1, -10, 9, 1], 100, 0))  # Output: 1
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the number of elements in the array `nums`.
- Calculating the sum of the array takes O(N).
- The subsequent difference calculation and division operations are O(1).

This approach ensures we achieve the desired sum with the minimum number of additions, adhering to all constraints provided.
