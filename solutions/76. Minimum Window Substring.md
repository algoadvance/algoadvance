title:  Minimum Window Substring-out
permalink: /s76
---

### Problem Statement
Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return the minimum window substring of `s` such that every character in `t` (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return an empty string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is it safe to assume that both strings `s` and `t` contain only ASCII characters?**
   - Yes.
2. **Can the input strings `s` and `t` be empty?**
   - Yes, they can. If `t` is empty, the function should return `""`, because there's no target substring to look for. If `s` is empty, the function should also return `""` since there's no window possible.

### Strategy
1. **Sliding Window Technique**:
    - We use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the current window.
    - Expand the `right` pointer to enlarge the window, and once the window contains all characters of `t`, contract the `left` pointer to minimize the window size.

2. **HashMap for Character Frequency**:
    - Use a hash map to store the frequency of characters in `t`.
    - Use another hash map to store the frequency of characters in the current window.

3. **Count of Unique Characters**:
    - Keep a count of unique characters that meet the required frequency in `t`. Once this count matches the size of `t`, we have a valid window.

### Code
Hereâ€™s an implementation of the above strategy:

```python
from collections import Counter, defaultdict

def minWindow(s: str, t: str) -> str:
    if not t or not s:
        return ""
    
    dict_t = Counter(t)
    required = len(dict_t)

    l, r = 0, 0
    formed = 0
    
    window_counts = defaultdict(int)
    
    ans = float("inf"), None, None

    while r < len(s):
        char = s[r]
        window_counts[char] += 1
        
        if char in dict_t and window_counts[char] == dict_t[char]:
            formed += 1
        
        while l <= r and formed == required:
            char = s[l]
            
            if r - l + 1 < ans[0]:
                ans = (r - l + 1, l, r)
                
            window_counts[char] -= 1
            if char in dict_t and window_counts[char] < dict_t[char]:
                formed -= 1
                
            l += 1
        
        r += 1
    
    return "" if ans[0] == float("inf") else s[ans[1]: ans[2] + 1]

# Example Usage
print(minWindow("ADOBECODEBANC", "ABC"))  # Output: "BANC"
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m + n)
  - We process each character in `s` and `t` at most twice (once when expanding the right pointer, and once when contracting the left pointer).
- **Space Complexity**: O(m + n)
  - We store counts of characters in two dictionaries, which in the worst case, might store all characters of `s` and `t`.

This solution efficiently finds the smallest window in `s` that contains all characters of `t`.
