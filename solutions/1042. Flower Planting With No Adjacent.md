title:  Flower Planting With No Adjacent-out
permalink: /s1042
---
You have `N` gardens, labeled `1` to `N`. In each garden, you want to plant one of 4 types of flowers. However, no two adjacent gardens can have the same type of flowers.

Given an array `paths`, where `paths[i] = [x, y]` describes that there is a bidirectional path between garden `x` and garden `y`, you need to assign a flower type to each garden such that no two adjacent gardens have the same type of flowers. Return any possible array `answer` where `answer[i]` is the type of flower planted in the `(i+1)`-th garden. The types of flowers are represented by `1`, `2`, `3`, and `4`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is it guaranteed that `paths` form an acyclic, connected graph?**
   - No, you should account for the possibility of the graph having cycles and multiple components.

2. **Does every garden have at least one direct path to another garden?**
   - No, some gardens might be isolated.

3. **What is the maximum value of `N`?**
   - Let's assume `N` can be up to `10^4`.

4. **Will there always be a solution?**
   - Yes, there will always be a solution since we have 4 types of flowers, and the presence of more choices guarantees a valid configuration.

### Code
```python
def gardenNoAdj(N, paths):
    from collections import defaultdict

    # Initialize the graph
    garden_graph = defaultdict(list)
    for x, y in paths:
        garden_graph[x].append(y)
        garden_graph[y].append(x)

    # Initialize the answer list with zeros meaning no flowers are planted yet.
    flowers = [0] * N

    # Iterate over each garden to assign a flower type.
    for garden in range(1, N + 1):
        # Set of flowers already used by adjacent gardens
        used_flowers = {flowers[adj - 1] for adj in garden_graph[garden]}
        
        # Find a flower type that is not used by adjacent gardens
        for flower in range(1, 5):
            if flower not in used_flowers:
                flowers[garden - 1] = flower
                break

    return flowers
```

### Strategy
1. **Graph Representation:** Use a dictionary to represent the graph, where each garden points to a list of connected gardens.
2. **Flower Assignment:** Use an array `flowers` where `flowers[i]` represents the flower type planted in garden `i+1`.
3. **Neighbor Tracking:** For each garden, check the flower types of its adjacent gardens and assign a different type to the current garden.
4. **Iterate and Assign:** Iterate through all gardens, and for each garden, assign the lowest possible flower type not used by its neighbors.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(N + E), where N is the number of gardens and E is the number of paths. This is because we are going through each garden and its neighbors at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N + E). The space required for the adjacency list representation of the graph and the `flowers` array.
