title:  Find the Pivot Integer-out
permalink: /s2485
---
You are given a positive integer `n`. A pivot integer is an integer `x` such that the sum of all integers from 1 to `x` is equal to the sum of all integers from `x` to `n`. Return the pivot integer `x`. If no such integer exists, return `-1`. If there are multiple pivot integers, return the largest one.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Are there any constraints on the value of `n`? 
   - Typically, what's the range of `n`? (E.g., small values below 100, or very large values up to 10^9)
2. Can the input `n` be 1?
3. Is `n` guaranteed to be a positive integer?

### Assumptions:
1. `n` is a positive integer.
2. The function should return the largest pivot integer if multiple such integers exist.
3. If no pivot integer exists, return `-1`.

## Strategy:
1. Define the sum of the first `x` integers: \( \text{Sum}(1 \text{ to } x) = \frac{x \times (x + 1)}{2} \)
2. Define the sum of integers from `x` to `n`: 
   \[
   \text{Sum}(x \text{ to } n) = \text{Sum}(1 \text{ to } n) - \text{Sum}(1 \text{ to } (x-1))
   \]
   \[
   = \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} - \frac{(x-1) \times x}{2}
   \]
3. Set those two sums equal to each other and solve for `x`:
   \[
   \frac{x \times (x + 1)}{2} = \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} - \frac{(x-1) \times x}{2}
   \]
4. Rearrange and solve the equation to find valid `x`.

### Code Implementation:

```python
def find_pivot_integer(n: int) -> int:
    left_sum = 0
    total_sum = n * (n + 1) // 2
    
    for x in range(1, n + 1):
        left_sum += x
        right_sum = total_sum - left_sum + x
        
        if left_sum == right_sum:
            return x
        
    return -1

# Test the function with an example
print(find_pivot_integer(8))  # Example test case
```

### Explanation:
1. Calculate the total sum of numbers from 1 to `n`.
2. Iterate over each integer `x` from 1 to `n`:
   - Incrementally calculate the left sum.
   - Calculate the right sum as the remaining total sum after subtracting the left sum.
   - If the left sum equals the right sum, return `x` as the pivot integer.
3. If no pivot is found, return `-1`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\) because it involves iterating through the integers from 1 to `n`. The space complexity is \(O(1)\) because the space required does not depend on the input size and only a few variables are used.
