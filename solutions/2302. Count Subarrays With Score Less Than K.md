title:  Count Subarrays With Score Less Than K-out
permalink: /s2302
---

You are given an array of integers `nums` and a positive integer `k`. The score of a subarray `(i, j)` is defined as the sum of the integers in the subarray multiplied by its length. Return the number of non-empty subarrays of `nums` whose score is strictly less than `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Will the array contain both positive and negative numbers?**
   - **Assumption:** The array `nums` can contain both positive and negative integers although containing mainly positive numbers is typical for such problems.
   
2. **What is the expected range of array length and values in `nums`?**
   - **Assumption:** The length of `nums` can be up to \(10^5\) and each value in `nums` will be within the range of typical integer values, possibly up to \(10^5\).

3. **Is the score of a subarray defined as the product of its sum and its length?**
   - Yes, that is correct.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a sliding window approach. This method allows us to consider each subarray exactly once while maintaining a running sum and the current window length. Here are the steps:

1. Initialize pointers `left` and `right` at the start of the array as the boundaries of our sliding window.
2. Maintain a running sum of the elements within the window.
3. Loop through the array using the `right` pointer:
   - Add the current element to the running sum.
   - Check if the current score (sum multiplied by the window length) is greater than or equal to `k`.
   - If the score exceeds `k`, increment the `left` pointer and adjust the running sum until the score is less than `k`.
   - For the current position of `right`, all subarrays ending at `right` and starting from `left` to `right` will have a score less than `k`. Therefore, add `(right - left + 1)` to the count.

By moving the `left` pointer efficiently, this should work in linear time \(O(n)\).

### Code

```python
def count_subarrays(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    left = 0
    current_sum = 0
    count = 0
    
    for right in range(n):
        current_sum += nums[right]
        
        while (current_sum * (right - left + 1)) >= k:
            current_sum -= nums[left]
            left += 1

        count += (right - left + 1)
        
    return count
```

### Time Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity:** The algorithm processes each element of the array at most twice (once while extending the window and once while contracting it). Therefore, it runs in \(O(n)\) time where \(n\) is the length of the array `nums`.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as we only use a few extra variables regardless of the input size.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count the subarrays with scores less than `k` by leveraging the sliding window technique.
