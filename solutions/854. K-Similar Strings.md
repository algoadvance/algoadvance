### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are A and B guaranteed to have the same length?**
   - Yes, as mentioned in the problem statement, A and B have the same length and are anagrams.
   
2. **Is the input only lowercase letters?**
   - Yes, A and B consist of lowercase letters.
   
3. **Can we assume `A` and `B` will always be non-empty strings?**
   - Yes, you can assume that since the problem statement doesn't address empty strings explicitly and contrasts are drawn from the examples provided.

### Strategy

To find the minimum number of swaps required to transform string `A` into string `B`, we can use BFS (Breadth-First Search). This approach ensures that we explore the shortest transformation sequence:

1. **Initialization**: Start by placing the initial state (A) into a queue. We'll also use a set to keep track of already seen states to avoid re-processing them.

2. **BFS Search**: For each state, generate all possible valid states from it by swapping only mismatched characters between `A` and `B`. Enqueue these new states to be processed in the next level of BFS. Repeat this process until we find `B`.

3. **Termination**: The process terminates as soon as we match `A` with `B`, ensuring the minimum number of swaps has been recorded.

### Code

Here's the implementation:

```python
from collections import deque

def kSimilarity(A: str, B: str) -> int:
    if A == B:
        return 0

    def neighbors(S):
        i = 0
        while S[i] == B[i]:
            i += 1
        for j in range(i + 1, len(S)):
            if S[j] == B[i] and S[j] != B[j]:
                yield S[:i] + S[j] + S[i + 1:j] + S[i] + S[j + 1:]
    
    queue = deque([(A, 0)])
    seen = {A}
    
    while queue:
        S, d = queue.popleft()
        for T in neighbors(S):
            if T == B:
                return d + 1
            if T not in seen:
                seen.add(T)
                queue.append((T, d + 1))
    
    return -1  # Should never be reached if A and B are anagrams

# Example usage
print(kSimilarity("ab", "ba"))  # Output: 1
print(kSimilarity("abc", "bca"))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is difficult to define precisely due to the combinatorial nature of string permutations. However:
- In each BFS level, we generate a number of permutations proportional to the length of the string.
- The worst-case scenario would be examining all permutations of the string (given they are anagrams). Hence, the solution generally operates within `O(n!)` (factorial time complexity), though in practical scenarios, the effective number of traversals is often much less due to the pruning by the `seen` set.

This BFS ensures we find the smallest `K` (minimum swaps) due to its level-wise search, thus providing an optimal solution.
