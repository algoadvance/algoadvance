title:  Number of Increasing Paths in a Grid-out
permalink: /s2328
---

Given an `m x n` grid of integers `grid`, return the number of strictly increasing paths in the grid. A path is a sequence of cells where each neighboring pair of cells' integers are strictly increasing. A path starts from any cell and ends at any cell, and you may move in the four cardinal directions (left, right, up, down).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - What should be the behavior if the grid is empty?
   - Are negative integers allowed in the grid?
   - Can the grid have only one row or one column?
   
2. **Movement Restrictions:**
   - Confirming that we can only move in the four main directions: up, down, left, and right.

3. **Constraints:**
   - What are the size limits for `m` and `n`?
   - Are there any constraints on the values of the integers in the grid?

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming with Depth-First Search (DFS):**
   - Utilize a DP table to store the number of increasing paths ending at each cell.
   - Use DFS with memoization to explore all possible increasing paths starting from each cell.
   - Sum up paths ending at each cell for the final result.

2. **Memoization:**
   - Memoize results of sub-problems to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.

3. **Directions Array:**
   - Use a directions array to simplify moving to adjacent cells. The directions array will be: `directions = [(0,1), (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0)]`.

### Code

```python
def countPaths(grid):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    modulo = 10**9 + 2  # To handle large numbers
    dp = [[-1] * n for _ in range(m)]  # Cache for memoization
    
    def dfs(i, j):
        # If we've already computed dp[i][j], return its value
        if dp[i][j] != -1:
            return dp[i][j]
        
        # Initialize the path count as 1 for the current cell itself
        path_count = 1
        
        # Explore all four possible directions
        for di, dj in [(0,1), (1,0), (0,-1), (-1,0)]:
            ni, nj = i + di, j + dj
            if 0 <= ni < m and 0 <= nj < n and grid[ni][nj] > grid[i][j]:
                path_count += dfs(ni, nj)
                path_count %= modulo
        
        dp[i][j] = path_count
        return path_count
    
    total_paths = 0
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            total_paths += dfs(i, j)
            total_paths %= modulo
    
    return total_paths

# Example usage:
grid = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [6, 5, 4],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
print(countPaths(grid))  # Example Output: 33
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Time Complexity:**
   - Each cell is visited once and in the worst case, all DFS explorations connected to that cell are performed. Hence, the complexity can be described as `O(m * n)` considering that each cell doesn't perform redundant calculations due to memoization.

2. **Space Complexity:**
   - The space used for the memoization table `dp` is `O(m * n)`.
   - Additionally, the recursion stack can go as deep as `O(m * n)` in the worst case scenario.

Overall, the approach efficiently handles the problem within the constraints provided.
