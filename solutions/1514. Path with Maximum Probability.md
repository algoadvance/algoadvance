title:  Path with Maximum Probability-out
permalink: /s1514
---

You are given an undirected, weighted graph of `n` nodes (0-indexed), represented by an edge list where `edges[i]` = [a, b] is an undirected edge connecting vertices `a` and `b` with a probability of success of traversing that edge `succProb[i]`.

Given two nodes `start` and `end`, find the path with the maximum probability of success to get from `start` to `end` and return its success probability.

If there is no path from `start` to `end`, return 0. 

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the probabilities be greater than 1?
   - No, probabilities lie between 0 and 1.
2. What should we return if the start and end nodes are the same?
   - We should return 1 as the probability of staying at the same place is 1.
3. Can the graph have loops or multiple edges between the same nodes?
   - Typically, this problem assumes there are no self-loops or multiple edges, but you can clarify this.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the path with the maximum product of probabilities. This approach, much like finding the shortest path in graphs, allows us to iteratively build the maximum probability path.

Instead of summing distances (as in traditional Dijkstra’s), we will multiply probabilities. To use Dijkstra's algorithm, we can utilize a priority queue where the priority is determined by the negative of the probability (because Python's `heapq` is a min-heap and we need the max-probability).

### Code

```python
from heapq import heappop, heappush
from collections import defaultdict
import heapq

def maxProbability(n, edges, succProb, start, end):
    # Create a graph as adjacency list
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for i, (a, b) in enumerate(edges):
        graph[a].append((b, succProb[i]))
        graph[b].append((a, succProb[i]))
    
    # Max-heap to maintain maximum probability
    max_heap = [(-1.0, start)]
    # Probability array to track maximum probability to each node
    probabilities = [0.0] * n
    probabilities[start] = 1.0
    
    while max_heap:
        # Get the node with the maximum probability
        prob, node = heappop(max_heap)
        prob *= -1  # Negate back to positive
        
        if node == end:
            return prob
        
        # Explore neighbors
        for neighbor, succ_prob in graph[node]:
            new_prob = prob * succ_prob
            if new_prob > probabilities[neighbor]:
                probabilities[neighbor] = new_prob
                heappush(max_heap, (-new_prob, neighbor))
    
    # If no path is found
    return 0.0

# Example usage
n = 3
edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2], [0, 2]]
succProb = [0.5, 0.5, 0.2]
start = 0
end = 2

print(maxProbability(n, edges, succProb, start, end))  # Output: 0.25
```

### Time Complexity

- **Building the Graph**: \(O(E)\), where \(E\) is the number of edges.
- **Heap Operations**: Each node is pushed and popped from the heap at most once, hence a complexity of \(O((V + E) \log V)\).

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(E + V \log V)\), where \(V\) is the number of vertices and \(E\) is the number of edges.

### Conclusion

The given strategy and implementation allow us to efficiently solve the problem using a variation of Dijkstra's algorithm. This method ensures we find the path with the maximum probability from start to end or return 0 if such a path doesn’t exist.
