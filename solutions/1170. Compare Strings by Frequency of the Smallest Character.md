title:  Compare Strings by Frequency of the Smallest Character-out
permalink: /s1170
---

Given two string arrays `queries` and `words`, return an integer array `answer`, where each `answer[i]` is the number of words such that `f(queries[i]) < f(W)`.

The function `f(s)` is defined as the frequency of the smallest character in a string `s`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum size of the input arrays `queries` and `words`?**
    - This will help us determine if the proposed solution will run efficiently within the given constraints.
   
2. **Are the characters in the strings guaranteed to be lowercase English letters?**
    - This might simplify the implementation of the function `f(s)`.

3. **Can the strings in `queries` and `words` be empty?**
    - This will help us handle edge cases.

## Strategy

1. **Function `f(s)`**:
    - Compute the frequency of the smallest character in string `s`. This involves finding the minimum character (lexicographically smallest), then counting its occurrences.

2. **Precompute Frequencies for Words**:
    - We will compute the frequencies of the smallest characters for all strings in the `words` array once to optimize the comparison process.

3. **Compare Frequencies**:
    - For each string in `queries`, compute its frequency using `f(s)`.
    - Count how many times this frequency is less than the precomputed frequencies from `words`.

4. **Efficient Counting Using Sorted List**:
    - Sort the precomputed frequencies from the `words` array.
    - Use binary search (via `bisect` module) to quickly count how many words have a higher frequency than the current query.

5. **Edge Cases**:
    - Handle empty strings if they are allowed.
    - Ensure that sorting and binary search do not produce incorrect results on edge cases.

## Code

```python
from bisect import bisect_right
from collections import Counter

def f(s: str) -> int:
    if not s:
        return 0
    min_char = min(s)
    return s.count(min_char)

def numSmallerByFrequency(queries, words):
    words_frequencies = sorted(f(word) for word in words)
    result = []
    
    for query in queries:
        query_freq = f(query)
        count = len(words_frequencies) - bisect_right(words_frequencies, query_freq)
        result.append(count)
    
    return result

# Example Usage
queries = ["cbd"]
words = ["zaaaz"]
print(numSmallerByFrequency(queries, words))  # Output: [1]
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Calculating `f(s)` for all elements**:
    - It involves finding the smallest character and counting its occurrences. This is O(n) for a string of length `n`. Assuming the average string length is constant (a reasonable assumption for English words), this can be approximated as O(1).

2. **Precomputing Frequencies for `words`**:
    - If there are `m` words, this step is O(m).

3. **Sorting Precomputed Frequencies**:
    - Sorting `m` elements is O(m log m).

4. **Binary Search for Each Query**:
    - For each of the `n` queries, binary search on the sorted word frequencies is O(log m).

Overall, the time complexity can be approximated as:
- Precomputation: O(m log m)
- For each query: O(1) frequency calculation + O(log m) binary search = O(log m)
- Total for `n` queries: O(n log m)

Hence, the overall complexity is O(m log m + n log m), which should be efficient for large inputs.
