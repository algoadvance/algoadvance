title:  Maximum Total Reward Using Operations I-out
permalink: /s3180
---

Given an integer array `nums` representing the base rewards of `n` rewards. There are two types of operations you may perform on arrays of rewards:

1. Add an integer to each element of the array.
2. Multiply each element of the array by an integer.

You are given `nums` and you need to maximize the total reward using operations. You are also given an integer `k` which represents the number of operations you can perform. 

The objective is to return the maximum total reward possible after performing up to `k` operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can you only perform each operation type once, or can you repeat them?
   **A:** You can repeat the operations as many times as you want, up to a total of `k` operations.

2. **Q:** Is the integer added or multiplied constrained in any way?
   **A:** The problem statement does not specify constraints on these integers, so we assume you can choose any integer.

3. **Q:** What are the constraints on the size of `nums` and on the value of `k`?
   **A:** Typical constraints for LeetCode problems apply unless otherwise mentioned in hidden test cases. However, for the sake of this question, let's assume `n` (the length of `nums`) can be up to `10^5` and `k` can also be up to `10^5`.

4. **Q:** Can you work with negative integers in `nums`?
   **A:** Yes, `nums` can contain negative integers.

### Strategy

To maximize the total reward efficiently:

1. **Selection of Operation:**
   - Multiplication by an integer greater than 1 generally has a greater increase on the array values, especially if the values are large.
   - Addition should be used with care because it adds a fixed amount, which might be less impactful than multiplication.

2. **Operation Execution Order:**
   - First, consider a sequence of multipliers to exponentially increase the array values.
   - Then, apply additions if necessary, especially when multipliers are not providing maximum benefits.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` stores the maximum sum of the array after `i` operations.
   - Iterate over adding potential integers and multiplying integers to update the `dp` array.
   - Consider all potential results after each operation.

### Implementation

```python
def maxTotalReward(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    
    # Initialize DP array to store maximum reward at each operation step.
    dp = nums[:]
    
    for _ in range(k):
        next_dp = [0] * n
        
        # Try adding a fixed integer
        added_option = max(add + 1 for add in nums)
        for i in range(n):
            next_dp[i] = dp[i] + added_option
        
        # Try multiplying by a fixed integer
        multiplied_option = max(mul * 2 for mul in nums if mul > 0)
        for i in range(n):
            next_dp[i] = max(next_dp[i], dp[i] * multiplied_option)
        
        # Update dp with the best option after this operation
        dp = next_dp
    
    # Return the maximum total reward possible
    return sum(dp)

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 2, 3]
k = 2
print(maxTotalReward(nums, k))  # Expected output should maximize the operations.
```

### Time Complexity

- The above algorithm iteratively computes the maximum reward for up to `k` operations.
- Each operational step (both addition and multiplication) takes O(n) time.
- Hence, the overall time complexity is \(O(k \cdot n)\).

This should be efficient for reasonably large inputs and aligns with the common constraints found in LeetCode problems.
