title:  Cat and Mouse II-out

This problem is from LeetCode, and it is a game theory problem involving two players: a cat and a mouse. The goal is to determine whether the mouse can escape from the cat. Here's the detailed problem statement:

A mouse and a cat play a game on an m x n grid.

- You are given a 2D array `grid` of size `m x n`, where each element represents:
  - `'M'`: Mouse starting position.
  - `'C'`: Cat starting position.
  - `'F'`: Food position.
  - `'.'`: An empty cell.
  - `'#'`: A wall.
- Moves: In each turn, the player can move to adjacent cells (up, down, left, right), but cannot move into walls or out of bounds.
- Rules: Both players can take turns moving to an adjacent cell; the mouse starts first. 
- Objective: The mouse wins if it reaches the food, and the cat wins if it catches the mouse (both on the same cell) or if the game lasts more than 1000 turns.

Determine if the mouse can escape given the initial configurations.

**Function signature:**
```python
class Solution:
    def canMouseWin(self, grid: List[str], catJump: int, mouseJump: int) -> bool:
```

Inputs:
- `grid`: List of strings, representing the game map.
- `catJump`: Integer, max number of cells a cat can jump.
- `mouseJump`: Integer, max number of cells a mouse can jump.

Outputs:
- Boolean: `True` if the mouse can win, `False` otherwise.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Q: Can both cat and mouse move the same number of cells (up to their respective jump limits) in one move?
   A: Yes, both can move up to their respective jump limits in one turn.

2. Q: When moving, do cat and mouse need to jump exactly their jump limit, or can they move to any cell within that range?
   A: They can move to any cell within that range.

3. Q: How is the grid size constrained?
   A: The grid size is usually small, optimized for game simulation problems.

4. Q: Can the mouse and cat move diagonally?
   A: No, only horizontally and vertically.

## Strategy

1. Use a game theory approach with memoization to determine if the mouse can win.
2. The state will include positions of mouse and cat along with whose turn it is.
3. Implement a DFS-like function with memoization to explore all potential moves.
4. Use constraints like wall positions, grid boundaries, and jump capabilities.
5. Track the turn number to ensure it does not exceed 1000.

class Solution:
    def canMouseWin(self, grid: List[str], catJump: int, mouseJump: int) -> bool:
        from functools import lru_cache
        
        ROWS, COLS = len(grid), len(grid[0])
        
        @lru_cache(None)
        def neighbors(x, y, jump):
            for dx, dy in ((0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)):
                for k in range(1, jump + 1):
                    nx, ny = x + dx*k, y + dy*k
                    if 0 <= nx < ROWS and 0 <= ny < COLS and grid[nx][ny] != '#':
                        yield (nx, ny)
                    else:
                        break
        
        # Find initial positions
        mouse_start = cat_start = food = None
        for r in range(ROWS):
            for c in range(COLS):
                if grid[r][c] == 'M':
                    mouse_start = (r, c)
                if grid[r][c] == 'C':
                    cat_start = (r, c)
                if grid[r][c] == 'F':
                    food = (r, c)
        
        @lru_cache(None)
        def search(mouse_pos, cat_pos, turn, depth):
            if depth > 1000:
                return False  # Avoid infinite games
            
            mouse_x, mouse_y = mouse_pos
            cat_x, cat_y = cat_pos
            
            if turn == 'mouse':
                for nx, ny in neighbors(mouse_x, mouse_y, mouseJump): 
                    if (nx, ny) == food:
                        return True  # Mouse wins
                    if (nx, ny) == cat_pos:
                        continue  # Cat catches mouse, invalid move
                    if not search((nx, ny), cat_pos, 'cat', depth + 1):
                        return True  # Found a winning path for mouse
                return False
            else:
                for nx, ny in neighbors(cat_x, cat_y, catJump):
                    if (nx, ny) == food:
                        continue  # Cat move to food, not important
                    if (nx, ny) == mouse_pos:
                        return False  # Mouse gets caught by cat
                    if not search(mouse_pos, (nx, ny), 'mouse', depth + 1):
                        return True  # Found a non-losing path for cat
                return False
        
        mouse_start = (mouse_start[0], mouse_start[1])
        cat_start = (cat_start[0], cat_start[1])
        return search(mouse_start, cat_start, 'mouse', 0)

```

## Time Complexity

- Given that states are dependent on positions and turn and that the depth is limited by the `1000` moves:
  - State complexity: `O(m * n * m * n * 1000)`
  - The computation leverages memoization to avoid redundant explorations.
