3031. **Minimum Time to Revert Word to Initial State II-out**

You are given an initial string `s` and a target string `t`, both consisting of lowercase English letters. 

In one operation, you can:

- Reverse any contiguous subarray of `s`.

Return the minimum number of operations required to transform `s` into `t`.

If it is impossible to transform `s` into `t`, return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the strings guaranteed to be of the same length?**
   - Yes, both `s` and `t` are of the same length according to the problem specification.

2. **Can substrings include single characters or the entire string?**
   - Yes, any contiguous subarray includes single characters and the entire string.

3. **Are both `s` and `t` only composed of lowercase English letters?**
   - Yes, both strings consist only of lowercase English letters.

## Strategy

The main insight is that the problem can be addressed as a series of operations to match each character of `s` with `t` in the minimum number of steps needed by rearranging subarrays.

**Steps:**
1. Identify places where `s` and `t` differ.
2. Use the minimum number of reversals to correct these differences.
3. If at any point characters at a specific position in `s` and `t` do not match and cannot be corrected through contiguous reversing, it's impossible to transform `s` into `t`.

## Code

```python
def min_operations_to_revert(s, t):
    # If both strings are already equal, no operations are needed
    if s == t:
        return 0

    n = len(s)
    s_list = list(s)

    operations = 0

    for i in range(n):
        if s_list[i] != t[i]:
            # Find the next position j in s_list where s_list[j] == t[i]
            j = i
            while j < n and s_list[j] != t[i]:
                j += 1

            # If there's no such position, it's impossible to transform s to t
            if j == n:
                return -1
            
            # Reverse the subarray from i to j
            s_list[i:j+1] = reversed(s_list[i:j+1])
            operations += 1
            
            # Check if s_list transform matches t
            if ''.join(s_list) == t:
                break

    return operations

# Example usage:
s = "abcde"
t = "edcba"
print(min_operations_to_revert(s, t))  # Output should be 1
```

## Time Complexity

**Time Complexity:**
- The worst-case time complexity is \(O(n^2)\):
  - For each character in `s`, find the corresponding character in `t` which might take \(O(n)\) time.
  - Reversing a subarray from `i` to `j` also takes \(O(n)\) time.

However, since practical input sizes \(n\) are often relatively small, this approach should be feasible for typical interview problems.
