title:  Minimum Cost to Equalize Array-out
permalink: /s3139
---

You are given an integer array `A` of length `n`. You can perform any number of operations (including zero), where in each operation you can select any two indices `i` and `j` (`1 <= i, j <= n`) such that `i != j` and increment `A[i]` by 1 and decrement `A[j]` by 1. 

Your task is to determine the minimum cost required to make all elements of the array equal. The cost of an operation is the sum of the absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the array after performing the operation. You can assume that it is always possible to achieve the goal.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values that elements of the array can take?**
   - There is no specific range mentioned for the array elements.

2. **Are negative numbers allowed in the array?**
   - Yes, arrays may contain negative numbers as well as positive numbers.

3. **What constitutes the 'cost' in this problem?**
   - The problem refers to the sum of absolute differences between all pairs of elements in the array. However, to achieve minimum cost, the method of equalizing the array is more important than continuously recalculating this cost.

4. **Is there an optimal target value for all elements, or do we need to derive this?**
   - The optimal target value for all elements is generally the median of the array, as moving all elements to the median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting the array allows for easier calculations regarding the median.
2. **Find the Median**: The median of the sorted array will be the target value to which all other elements should be moved to minimalize the sum of absolute deviations.
3. **Calculate Deviations**: Calculate the cost to change every element to the median by finding the absolute difference between each array element and the median and summing these differences.

### Code

```python
def min_cost_to_equalize_array(A):
    A.sort()
    n = len(A)
    # The median minimizes the sum of absolute differences
    if n % 2 == 1:
        median = A[n // 2]
    else:
        median = (A[n // 2 - 1] + A[n // 2]) // 2
    
    cost = sum(abs(x - median) for x in A)
    return cost

# Example usage:
A = [1, 2, 3]
print(min_cost_to_equalize_array(A))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting the Array**: `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of elements in the array \(A\).
2. **Calculating Deviation Costs**: `O(n)` to sum up deviations after finding the median.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`, dominated by the sort operation.
