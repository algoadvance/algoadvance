title:  Longest Turbulent Subarray-out
permalink: /s978
---

Given an integer array `arr`, you need to return the length of a maximum size turbulent subarray of `arr`.

A subarray is turbulent if the comparison signs between consecutive elements strictly alternate. More formally, a subarray `arr[i:j+1]` is turbulent if and only if for each `k` in the range `i <= k < j`:
- `arr[k] > arr[k+1]` when `k` is odd, and  
- `arr[k] < arr[k+1]` when `k` is even  
or
- `arr[k] < arr[k+1]` when `k` is odd, and  
- `arr[k] > arr[k+1]` when `k` is even  

The array length indicates the number of subarrays to be concerned with.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the minimum length of `arr`?**
   - The minimum length of `arr` is 1.

2. **Are the elements in `arr` unique?**
   - No, elements in `arr` can repeat.

3. **What kind of integer values does `arr` contain?**
   - `arr` can contain any integer values, positive, negative or zero.

### Code

```python
def maxTurbulenceSize(arr):
    if len(arr) == 1:
        return 1
    
    inc = dec = 1
    max_len = 1
    
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] > arr[i - 1]:
            inc = dec + 1
            dec = 1
        elif arr[i] < arr[i - 1]:
            dec = inc + 1
            inc = 1
        else:
            inc = dec = 1
        max_len = max(max_len, inc, dec)
    
    return max_len

# Example usage
arr = [9,4,2,10,7,8,8,1,9]
print(maxTurbulenceSize(arr))  # Output: 5
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - If the array length is 1, return 1 because a single element is trivially turbulent.
   - Initialize three variables:
     - `inc`: Tracks the length of the subarray ending at the current element in an increasing pattern.
     - `dec`: Tracks the length of the subarray ending at the current element in a decreasing pattern.
     - `max_len`: To store the maximum length of any turbulent subarray found during traversal.

2. **Traversal**:
   - Start iterating from the second element of the array.
   - For each element, compare it with its previous element.
     - If `arr[i] > arr[i-1]`, it means we're in an "up" position of a turbulent sequence, so update `inc`.
     - If `arr[i] < arr[i-1]`, it means we're in a "down" position of a turbulent sequence, so update `dec`.
     - If `arr[i] == arr[i-1]`, reset both `inc` and `dec` because the sequence is broken.
   - After each update, compare the lengths of `inc` and `dec` with `max_len` and update `max_len` if necessary.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the array. This is because we only make a single pass through the array.
- The space complexity is **O(1)** since we are using only a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size. 

This efficient approach ensures that we find the maximum turbulent subarray length with minimal computation.
