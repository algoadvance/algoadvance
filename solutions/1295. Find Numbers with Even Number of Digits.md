title:  Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits-out
permalink: /s1295

Given an array `nums` of integers, return how many of them contain an even number of digits.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Range:** What is the range of values in the input array `nums`?
   - The input values will be non-negative integers.

2. **Output:** What do we return if there are no numbers with an even number of digits?
   - You would return `0` since no numbers have an even number of digits.

3. **Constraints:**
   - The input array size (`nums.length`) will be in the range [1, 500].
   - Each integer in `nums` is in the range [1, 10^5].

## Strategy:
To determine if a number has an even number of digits:
1. Convert the integer to a string.
2. Count the length of the string representation.
3. Check if the length is even.

To count the total:
1. Iterate through the list `nums`.
2. For each number, check if it has an even number of digits.
3. Maintain a counter to keep track of numbers with an even digit count.
4. Return the counter value at the end.

## Time Complexity:
- Converting an integer to a string takes O(d) time where d is the number of digits in the integer (which can be considered constant time for practical purposes since the number of digits is relatively small).
- The overall time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array `nums`.

## Code:

```python
def findNumbers(nums):
    even_digits_count = 0
    for num in nums:
        # Convert the number to string and check its length
        if len(str(num)) % 2 == 0:
            even_digits_count += 1
    return even_digits_count

# Example test case
nums = [12, 345, 2, 6, 7896]
print(findNumbers(nums))  # Output should be 2
```

This code will correctly count and return the number of integers in the `nums` array that have an even number of digits.
