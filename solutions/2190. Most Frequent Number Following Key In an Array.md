title:  Most Frequent Number Following Key In an Array-out
permalink: /s2190
---

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `key`, you want to find the most frequent number that immediately follows an occurrence of `key` in the array. Return the number which appears most frequently.

Example:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,100,200,1,100], key = 1
Output: 100
Explanation: For `key` = 1, the number following it is `100`. Since `100` appears most frequently, we return 100.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are there guaranteed to be at least one instance of `key` in the array?
2. How should ties be handled if there are multiple numbers with the same frequency?

These questions help ensure that the input is valid and clarify the expected output in ambiguous cases.

## Strategy

1. **Initialize a Dictionary:** 
   Create a dictionary to keep track of how often each number appears immediately after the `key`.

2. **Traverse the Array:** 
   Move through the array and check each element:
   - If the current element is the `key`, increment the count of the element that follows it (if it exists) in the dictionary.

3. **Identify the Most Frequent Follower:** 
   After populating the dictionary, find the key-value pair with the highest frequency.

4. **Return the Result:** 
   Return the number that has the highest frequency as the result.

## Code

```python
def mostFrequent(nums, key):
    from collections import defaultdict

    # Dictionary to store the frequency of each number following the key
    freq_dict = defaultdict(int)
    
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
        if nums[i] == key:
            freq_dict[nums[i + 1]] += 1
    
    # Determine the most frequent following number
    most_frequent_num = max(freq_dict, key=freq_dict.get)
    
    return most_frequent_num

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 100, 200, 1, 100]
key = 1
print(mostFrequent(nums, key))  # Output: 100
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. This is because we only need to traverse the array once to populate the dictionary.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(k)` where `k` is the number of distinct elements that appear immediately after the `key`. In the worst case, this is still `O(n)`.

The solution efficiently counts and identifies the most frequent follower and is well-suited for large input sizes.
