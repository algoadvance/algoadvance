title:  Number of Flowers in Full Bloom-out
permalink: /s2251
---

Given a 2D integer array `flowers` where `flowers[i] = [starti, endi]` indicates that the i-th flower will bloom from `starti` to `endi` (both inclusive), and an integer array `people` where `people[j]` is the time when the j-th person will arrive to see the flowers, return an integer array `answer` of size `people.length` where `answer[j]` is the number of flowers that are in full bloom when the j-th person arrives.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the `starti` and `endi` values inclusive?
   - Yes, both `starti` and `endi` are inclusive.
2. Can the same start and end times appear multiple times in the `flowers` array?
   - Yes, multiple flowers can have the same blooming period.
3. Are there any constraints on the size of `flowers` or `people` arrays?
   - The problem size generally fits the constraints suitable for competitive programming and should be optimized for efficiency.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can leverage the following approach:
1. Use event counting to keep track of the blooming period of the flowers.
2. We can create an event for each start and end of a flower bloom.
3. Use sorting and prefix sums to efficiently find out the number of flowers blooming at any given time.

Detailed steps:
1. Create two arrays `starts` and `ends` to record the start and end times of each flower.
2. Sort both arrays.
3. For each arrival time in `people`, use binary search to determine the number of started flowers (up to the arrival time) and the number of ended flowers (up to just before the arrival time).
4. The difference between the counts from these two arrays gives the number of flowers in full bloom at each arrival time.

This approach ensures that we maintain efficiency, even for larger input sizes, since major operations involve sorting and binary search.

### Code

```python
from bisect import bisect_right, bisect_left

def fullBloomFlowers(flowers, people):
    starts = sorted(flower[0] for flower in flowers)
    ends = sorted(flower[1] for flower in flowers)
    
    results = []
    for person in people:
        num_starts = bisect_right(starts, person)
        num_ends = bisect_left(ends, person)
        results.append(num_starts - num_ends)
    
    return results

# Example usage:
flowers = [[1, 4], [2, 3], [4, 6]]
people = [2, 3, 7]
print(fullBloomFlowers(flowers, people))  # Expected: [2, 2, 0]
```

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the `starts` and `ends` arrays will take \(O(N \log N)\) where \(N\) is the number of flowers.
- For each person, the binary search will take \(O(\log N)\).
- Processing each person (M persons) will take \(O(M \log N)\).

Overall time complexity: \(O(N \log N + M \log N)\) which is efficient for reasonably large inputs.

This solution effectively combines sorting and binary search to efficiently determine the flowering status for each arrival time.
