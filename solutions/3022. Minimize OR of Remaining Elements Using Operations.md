title:  Minimize OR of Remaining Elements Using Operations-out
permalink: /s3022
---

You are given an integer array `nums`. You are allowed to perform the following operation multiple times:

- Choose any subarray from `nums` and apply the bitwise OR operation to all the elements of the chosen subarray. Replace the subarray with the result of the bitwise OR operation.

Your goal is to minimize the bitwise OR of all the elements left in the array after performing the operations.

Return the minimum possible value of the bitwise OR of the remaining elements.

### Strategy

To minimize the bitwise OR of the left elements, we need to consider merging subarrays in such a way that the overall OR value stays as small as possible.

Let's break down the steps:

1. **Initial Observations**: 
   - The OR operation is associative and commutative, meaning the order of operations doesn’t change the outcome.
   - The OR of any set of numbers is always greater than or equal to the largest number in the set.
   
2. **Potential Approach**:
   - We should consider merging subarrays which, when OR'd together, will produce the smallest result.
   - The goal is to OR together as few numbers as possible because OR’ing more numbers generally increases the OR value.

3. **Greedy Strategy**:
   - We can use a greedy approach where we continually merge adjacent elements if the result does not increase the OR value too much.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are there any constraints on the size of `nums`?
2. Is there a guarantee that `nums` has at least one element?
3. Do we need to maintain the original order of elements in `nums`?

### Code

Here is the implementation of the above strategy in Python:

```python
def minimize_or(nums):
    # Initialize the resultant OR with the first element
    result = nums[0]
    
    # Iterate through all elements of the array
    for num in nums[1:]:
        # Update the result with OR of current element
        result |= num
        
        # If result becomes zero, we can't minimize further
        if result == 0:
            break
            
    return result

# Example usage:
# nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
# Output should be the minimum possible OR value
print(minimize_or([1, 2, 3, 4]))  # Example call
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - The function iterates through the list exactly once, performing a constant-time OR operation at each step.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We use a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

### Final Thoughts

- The greedy approach ensures that we handle each element once and keep the OR value as minimal as possible with each operation.
- Bitwise OR operation properties make it efficient to determine the smallest possible OR by iterating through the list once.

This strategy and implementation should help in minimizing the OR for the given array based on the problem constraints and the properties of the bitwise OR operation.
