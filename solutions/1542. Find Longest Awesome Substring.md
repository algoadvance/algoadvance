title:  Find Longest Awesome Substring-out
permalink: /s1542
---

Given a string `s`. An awesome substring is a non-empty substring of `s` such that we can make any character within this substring a palindrome by reordering the characters.

Return the length of the maximum length awesome substring of `s`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What characters does the string contain?**
   - The string consists of digits `0-9`.

2. **What is the maximum length of the string `s`?**
   - The length of `s` can go up to `10^5`.

3. **What constitutes an "awesome" substring?**
   - An "awesome" substring is defined as a substring that can be rearranged to form a palindrome.

## Strategy

To find the longest "awesome" substring:

1. **Palindrome Characteristics:**
   - For a string to be rearranged into a palindrome, at most one character can have an odd count, while all others must have even counts.

2. **Use Bit Masking:**
   - We can use a bitmask to represent the parity (odd/even) of counts of the characters.
   - A bitmask of length 10 (for digits 0-9) where each bit represents the count of a digit mod 2.

3. **Prefix Hash Map:**
   - Use a dictionary to store the earliest occurrence of each bitmask.
   - As we scan the string, we compute the current bitmask and check if this bitmask or any bitmask with exactly one bit different has been seen before. If so, the difference between the current index and the earliest occurrence of the previous bitmask gives a candidate for the substring length.

4. **Initialization:**
   - Start with an initial bitmask of `0` at index `-1` (to handle cases where a prefix itself forms a valid substring).

5. **Iterate through the string:**
   - Update the bitmask for each character.
   - Check for the current bitmask and its variations in the dictionary.
   - Update the maximum length accordingly.

## Code

```python
def longestAwesome(s: str) -> int:
    # Dictionary to store the first occurrence index of each bitmask
    first_occurrence = {0: -1}
    max_length = 0
    current_mask = 0
    
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        # Update the current_mask by flipping the bit of the current character
        current_mask ^= 1 << int(char)
        
        # If this bitmask has been seen before, check the length of the substring
        if current_mask in first_occurrence:
            max_length = max(max_length, i - first_occurrence[current_mask])
        else:
            first_occurrence[current_mask] = i
        
        # Check all bitmasks that differ from current_mask by exactly one bit
        for j in range(10):
            possible_mask = current_mask ^ (1 << j)
            if possible_mask in first_occurrence:
                max_length = max(max_length, i - first_occurrence[possible_mask])
                
    return max_length
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the string. This is because we iterate through the string once, and the operations inside the loop (bit manipulation and dictionary lookups) take constant time.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1024) due to the bitmask dictionary which can store up to `2^10` possible bitmasks, which simplifies to O(1) space.
