title:  Find K Closest Elements-out
permalink: /s658
---

Given a sorted integer array `arr`, two integers `k` and `x`, return the `k` closest integers to `x` in the array. The result should also be sorted in ascending order. An integer `a` is closer to `x` than an integer `b` if:

- `|a - x| < |b - x|`, or
- `|a - x| == |b - x|` and `a < b`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the input values?**
   - The array `arr` is sorted in ascending order.
   - The length of the array (`n`) and the integers `k` and `x` can vary within certain constraints typically found in competitive programming (e.g., `1 <= k <= n` and `1 <= n <= 10^4` or `10^5`).

2. **Could there be duplicate values in the array?**
   - Yes, the array may have duplicate values.

3. **If k is greater than the number of elements in the array, what should be returned?**
   - Given the constraints, we assume `1 <= k <= n`. Hence, this situation should not occur.

## Strategy

To find the `k` closest integers to `x`, we can use a binary search combined with a two-pointer technique:

1. **Binary Search**: Identify the position to potentially insert `x` in the array.
2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: Extend outwards from the position to find the `k` closest elements.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

1. **Binary Search**: Use `bisect_left` to find the index where `x` would be inserted to maintain the sorted order.
2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: Initialize two pointers, left and right, around the found index.
3. **Expand the window**: Expand outward from the initial window's left and right to include the closest elements until you get `k` elements.
4. **Sort the result**: Finally, sort the extracted elements in ascending order.

## Code

Here's the Python implementation of the above strategy:

```python
from bisect import bisect_left

def findClosestElements(arr, k, x):
    # Find the index where `x` would be inserted to keep the sorted order
    position = bisect_left(arr, x)
    
    # Initialize two pointers
    left = position - 1
    right = position
    
    # While we need to find k elements
    while k > 0:
        # If left pointer is out of bounds, move right pointer
        if left < 0:
            right += 1
        # If right pointer is out of bounds, move left pointer
        elif right >= len(arr):
            left -= 1
        # Compare the distance of two pointers to x
        elif abs(arr[left] - x) <= abs(arr[right] - x):
            left -= 1
        else:
            right += 1
        # Decrease k since we have selected one element
        k -= 1
    
    # Return the sub-array from left+1 to right (exclusive)
    return arr[left + 1:right]

# Example usage
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
k = 4
x = 3
print(findClosestElements(arr, k, x))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is:
- **Binary Search (bisect_left)**: `O(log n)`
- **Two-Pointer Expansion**: `O(k)`

Overall, the time complexity is `O(log n + k)`. Given the constraints, this approach is efficient and should perform well for large inputs.
