title:  Sum of Root To Leaf Binary Numbers-out
permalink: /s1022
---
You are given the root of a binary tree where each node has a value `0` or `1`. Each root-to-leaf path represents a binary number starting with the most significant bit. For example, if the path is `0 -> 1 -> 1 -> 0 -> 1`, then this could represent the binary number `01101`, which is `13` in decimal.

For all leaves in the tree, consider the numbers represented by the path from the root to that leaf. Return the sum of these numbers.

#### Example:
```plaintext
Input: root = [1,0,1,0,1,0,1]
Output: 22
Explanation: (100) + (101) + (110) + (111) = 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 22
```

#### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- `Node.val` is `0` or `1`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. What is the format for the input tree? For instance, how is the binary tree represented given the list-type input?
   - The input is provided in a level-order traversal array which can be converted to a binary tree using standard methods or helper functions.

2. Does the tree contain only binary values (i.e., `0` and `1`) at each node?
   - Yes, each node's value is constrained to be either `0` or `1`.

### Strategy:
1. **Tree Traversal**: Perform a Depth First Search (DFS) to explore all root-to-leaf paths.
2. **Binary Number Construction**:
   - Construct the binary number as we traverse from root to leaf.
   - Each time we move to a child node, the current binary value will be left shifted by 1 position (equivalent to multiplying by 2) and then adding the child node's value.
3. **Sum Calculation**: Keep a running total of the values of all binary numbers found.

### Code:
Here is a Python function to solve the problem:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def sumRootToLeaf(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        def dfs(node, current):
            if not node:
                return 0
            
            current = (current << 1) | node.val
            
            # If we are at the leaf node
            if not node.left and not node.right:
                return current
            
            # Sum the values obtained from both subtrees
            return dfs(node.left, current) + dfs(node.right, current)
        
        return dfs(root, 0)
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: 
  - The space complexity is `O(H)`, where `H` is the height of the tree due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (skewed tree), the height `H` could be equal to `N`, resulting in `O(N)`. In a balanced tree, the height `H` would be `O(log N)`.
