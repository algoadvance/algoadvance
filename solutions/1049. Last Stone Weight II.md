title:  Last Stone Weight II-out
permalink: /s1049
---

We have a collection of stones, each stone has a positive integer weight.

Each turn, we choose any two stones and smash them together. Suppose the stones have weights `x` and `y` with `x <= y`. The result of this smash is:

- If `x == y`, both stones are destroyed, and
- If `x != y`, the stone of weight `x` is destroyed, and the stone of weight `y` has new weight `y-x`.

At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left. Return the smallest possible weight of the left stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. Can the input list be empty?
   - No, the list will have at least one stone, as per problem constraints.
2. Are the weights of the stones always positive integers?
   - Yes, the weights are always positive integers.

### Strategy:

This problem can be approached using dynamic programming and is akin to the "Partition Equal Subset Sum" problem in some respects. 

Here's the plan:

1. **Sum Calculation:** Compute the total sum of all stones. Let's call this `S`.
2. **Knapsack Problem:** We need to partition the stones into two groups such that the difference between the sums of the two groups is minimized.
3. **DP Array:** Use a DP array to keep track of which sums can be achieved with the subsets of the stones.
4. **Objective:** We aim to find the largest sum `s1` that is ≤ `S // 2`. The smallest possible weight of the remaining stone would then be `S - 2 * s1`.

### Code:

```python
def lastStoneWeightII(stones):
    # Step 1: Calculate the total sum of all stones
    total_sum = sum(stones)
    n = len(stones)

    # Step 2: Initialize the DP array with the size 'total_sum // 2 + 1'
    target = total_sum // 2
    dp = [False] * (target + 1)
    dp[0] = True

    # Step 3: Populate the dp array
    for stone in stones:
        for weight in range(target, stone - 1, -1):
            dp[weight] = dp[weight] or dp[weight - stone]

    # Step 4: Find the largest sum `s1` that can be achieved which is ≤ `target`
    for i in range(target, -1, -1):
        if dp[i]:
            s1 = i
            break

    # Step 5: Calculate the smallest possible weight of the remaining stone
    return total_sum - 2 * s1

# Example usage:
stones = [2, 7, 4, 1, 8, 1]
print(lastStoneWeightII(stones))  # Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity:

- The time complexity of this solution is `O(n * target)`, where `n` is the number of stones and `target` is `total_sum // 2`.
- The space complexity is `O(target)` due to the DP array.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the smallest possible weight of the remaining stone by using a dynamic programming technique similar to the 0/1 knapsack problem.
