title:  Find All Good Indices-out
permalink: /s2420
---

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` of size `n` and a positive integer `k`.

We call an index `i` in `nums` a good index if the following conditions hold:
- `k <= i <= n - k - 1`
- The `k` elements before `i` are non-increasing.
- The `k` elements after `i` are non-decreasing.

Return an array of all good indices sorted in increasing order.

### Example:
```python
Input: nums = [2,1,1,1,3,4,1], k = 2
Output: [2,3]
Explanation:
For index 2, the subarray [2, 1] is non-increasing and [1, 3] is non-decreasing.
For index 3, the subarray [1, 1] is non-increasing and [3, 4] is non-decreasing.
```

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **What constraints can we assume on `n` and `k?**
   - `n` is the size of the array which can range from 1 to 10^5.
   - `k` is a positive integer. The value of `k` is such that `k <= n/2`.

2. **What are the contents of the array?**
   - The array `nums` contains integers which can be positive, negative, or zero.

3. **Do the sub-arrays include the element at index `i`?**
   - No, `k` elements before `i` and `k` elements after `i` do not include the element at index `i`.

## Strategy:
1. Create two boolean arrays `non_increasing` and `non_decreasing` of size `n`. These arrays will indicate whether the sub-arrays ending or starting at a particular index are non-increasing or non-decreasing, respectively.
2. Populate the `non_increasing` array by iterating over the array from left to right.
3. Populate the `non_decreasing` array by iterating over the array from right to left.
4. Iterate through indices from `k` to `n - k - 1` and check the conditions for being a good index using the `non_increasing` and `non_decreasing` arrays.
5. Collect all the "good" indices and return them.

## Code:
```python
def goodIndices(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    non_increasing = [True] * n
    non_decreasing = [True] * n
    
    # Fill non_increasing array
    for i in range(1, n):
        if nums[i] > nums[i-1]:
            non_increasing[i] = False
    
    # Correct the prefix for non_increasing
    for i in range(1, n):
        if not non_increasing[i-1]:
            non_increasing[i] = False
    
    # Fill non_decreasing array
    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
        if nums[i] > nums[i+1]:
            non_decreasing[i] = False
    
    # Correct the suffix for non_decreasing
    for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
        if not non_decreasing[i+1]:
            non_decreasing[i] = False
    
    result = []
    for i in range(k, n - k): 
        if non_increasing[i-1] and non_decreasing[i+k]:
            result.append(i)
    
    return result

# Example Usage
nums = [2,1,1,1,3,4,1]
k = 2
print(goodIndices(nums, k))  # Output: [2, 3]
```

## Time Complexity:
- The overall time complexity is O(n), since we traverse the array multiple times with linear passes.
- The space complexity is O(n) as we use two additional arrays of size `n`.
