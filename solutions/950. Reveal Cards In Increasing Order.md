title:  Reveal Cards In Increasing Order-out
permalink: /s950
---

You are given an integer array `deck`. There is a deck of cards where every card has a unique integer. The integer on the `i`-th card is `deck[i]`. 

You can order the deck according to a set of rules:

1. You have to reveal the top card of the deck.
2. If there are still cards in the deck, you must insert the next top card to the bottom of the deck.
3. You repeat this process until there are no more cards to reveal.

Return an ordering of the deck that would reveal the cards in increasing order.

**Example:**
```text
Input: deck = [17,13,11,2,3,5,7]
Output: [2,13,3,11,5,17,7]
Explanation: 
We get the deck in the order [17,13,11,2,3,5,7] (this isn't sorted yet, but is in arbitrary order).
After sorting it, we get [2,3,5,7,11,13,17].
When we reveal the cards as described, we get [2,13,3,11,5,17,7].
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= deck.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= deck[i] <= 10^6`
- All the values in the deck are unique.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. Can we assume that the input list is not sorted?
   - Yes, the input list `deck` is not sorted by default.
2. Are there any constraints on the operations performed, or can we directly simulate the revealing process?
   - No specific constraints. You can directly simulate the process.

## Strategy:

1. **Sort the Deck**: Start by sorting the input `deck` to arrange it in increasing order.
2. **Simulate the Process**:
   - Use a double-ended queue (deque) to simulate the revealing and inserting to the bottom process efficiently.
   - Start with an empty deque and simulate the reversed process.
   - For each card in the sorted `deck` (iterating from largest to smallest):
     - If the deque is non-empty, move the last revealed card (currently in front) to the bottom.
     - Append the current card to the front of the deque.
3. **Convert deque to List**: Finally, convert the deque back to a list to get the desired order.

Letâ€™s now translate this strategy into code.

## Code:

```python
from collections import deque

def deckRevealedIncreasing(deck):
    # Sort the deck in increasing order
    deck.sort()
    
    # Initialize deque to simulate the process
    deque_simulate = deque()
    
    # Iterate over sorted deck in reverse order
    for card in reversed(deck):
        if deque_simulate:
            deque_simulate.appendleft(deque_simulate.pop())
        deque_simulate.appendleft(card)
    
    return list(deque_simulate)

# Example usage:
deck = [17, 13, 11, 2, 3, 5, 7]
print(deckRevealedIncreasing(deck))  # Output: [2, 13, 3, 11, 5, 17, 7]
```

## Time Complexity:

- Sorting the deck takes \(O(n \log n)\) time where \(n\) is the number of cards.
- Simulating the revealing process with deque operations (appendleft and pop) takes \(O(n)\) since each operation is \(O(1)\) and we perform a bounded number of operations for each card.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the order of the deck to reveal cards in increasing order.
