title:  Valid Permutations for DI Sequence-out
permalink: /s903
---

A permutation of an array of integers is an arrangement of its members into a sequence or linear order.

Given a string `s`, where `s[i] == 'D'` means the `ith` pair of consecutive characters in the permutation should be in decreasing order, and `s[i] == 'I'` means the `ith` pair of consecutive characters in the permutation should be in increasing order.

Valid permutations are those that satisfy the given conditions.

Return the number of valid permutations. As the answer can be large, return it modulo `10**9 + 7`.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: s = "DID"
Output: 5
Explanation:
The 5 valid permutations of [0,1,2,3] are:
(3, 0, 1, 2)
(2, 0, 3, 1)
(2, 1, 3, 0)
(1, 0, 3, 2)
(1, 0, 2, 3)
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the length of the string `s`?**
   - The length of `s` can be up to 200.

2. **Are there any constraints on the characters in the string `s`?**
   - The string `s` contains only the characters 'D' and 'I'.

3. **Do you provide the initial permutation set, or should it be derived from the length of `s`?**
   - We derive the initial permutation set from the length of `s` + 1.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we will:
1. Use dynamic programming (DP) to track the number of valid permutations.
2. Define a DP table `dp[i][j]` where `i` is the length of the processed sequence and `j` is the last number used in the sequence. This table will store the count of permutations of length `i+1` ending with `j`.
3. Iterate over the string `s` and update the DP table based on whether the current character is 'D' or 'I'.
4. Sum up the values in the DP table for the final result and return it modulo `10**9 + 7`.

## Code
Here is the detailed implementation of the solution:

```python
def numPermsDISequence(s: str) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    n = len(s)
    
    # dp[i][j] means the number of ways to place first (i+1) numbers with the (i+1)th number is j-th number.
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Initialization: with one number, there's exactly one way to place it
    for j in range(n + 1):
        dp[0][j] = 1
    
    # Fill DP table
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if s[i - 1] == 'I':
            cumulative = 0
            for j in range(n - i + 1):
                cumulative = (cumulative + dp[i - 1][j]) % MOD
                dp[i][j] = cumulative
        else:
            cumulative = 0
            for j in range(n - i, -1, -1):
                cumulative = (cumulative + dp[i - 1][j + 1]) % MOD
                dp[i][j] = cumulative
    
    # The result is the sum of all dp[n][*]
    return sum(dp[n-1][j] for j in range(n + 1)) % MOD

# Example usage
s = "DID"
print(numPermsDISequence(s))  # Output: 5
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2), where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because we are using nested loops up to the length of `s` to fill the DP table.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n^2), for storing the DP table.
