title:  Closest Room-out
permalink: /s1847
---

You are given two arrays `rooms` and `queries`, where:
- `rooms[i] = [roomId, size]` contains the ID and size of the i-th room.
- `queries[j] = [preferred, minSize]` contains the preferred room ID and the minimum size required for the j-th query.

For each query, you must find the room ID with the closest room number to the preferred room that meets the minimum size requirement. If two rooms have the same distance to the preferred room, choose the room with the smaller ID. If no such room exists, return -1 for that query.

Return an array of results, where the result for each query is in the same order as the queries.

### Example

```text
Input: rooms = [[2,2],[1,2],[3,2]], queries = [[3,1],[3,3],[5,2]]
Output: [3, -1, 3]
Explanation:
For the first query, the room closest to room 3 is room 3, which meets the size requirement.
For the second query, there are no rooms that meet the size requirement.
For the third query, the room closest to room 5 is room 3, which meets the size requirement.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the room IDs and sizes be negative or are they always positive? 
2. Can there be duplicate room IDs in the `rooms` array?
3. How large can the input arrays be?
4. Should we consider the room ID as a numerical value and compute distances as absolute differences?

## Strategy

1. **Sort Rooms:** We will start by sorting the rooms based on their size since for each query, we need to find rooms with particular minimum sizes efficiently.
2. **Binary Search for Queries:** For each query, we will use binary search to find rooms that meet the size requirements.
3. **Choose Closest Room:** From the filtered list of rooms (meeting the size requirements), we will then find the room with the closest room ID to the preferred room ID using a custom comparator.

## Code

```python
from bisect import bisect_left

def closest_rooms(rooms, queries):
    rooms.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort rooms by size
    results = [-1] * len(queries)   # Placeholder for results
    
    sorted_queries = sorted(enumerate(queries), key=lambda x: x[1][1])  # Sort queries based on minSize
    
    room_ids = []
    j = 0
    
    for index, (preferred, minSize) in sorted_queries:
        while j < len(rooms) and rooms[j][1] < minSize:
            room_ids.append(rooms[j][0])
            j += 1
        
        if not room_ids:
            results[index] = -1
        else:
            pos = bisect_left(room_ids, preferred)
            candidates = []
            if pos < len(room_ids):
                candidates.append(room_ids[pos])
            if pos > 0:
                candidates.append(room_ids[pos-1])
            
            closest_id = min(candidates, key=lambda x: (abs(x - preferred), x))
            results[index] = closest_id            
    
    return results
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting Rooms:** `O(m log m)` where `m` is the number of rooms.
- **Sorting Queries:** `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of queries.
- **Binary Search for Each Query:** For each query, the binary search step is `O(log m)`.

Hence overall time complexity is `O(m log m + n log n + n log m)`.

## Optimizations

1. Further optimizations could involve more complex data structures like balanced trees or segment trees to manage the locations efficiently and maintain the sorted order.
2. Preprocessing steps can be optimized to handle specific edge cases or constraints given more detailed requirements.
