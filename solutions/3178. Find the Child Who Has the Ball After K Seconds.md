title:  Find the Child Who Has the Ball After K Seconds-out
permalink: /s3178

You are playing a game with `n` children standing in a circle, numbered from `0` to `n-1`. Initially, the child at position `0` has a ball. The game proceeds for `k` seconds. Every second, the child who has the ball passes it to the next child in the circle, i.e., the ball moves from position `i` to position `(i+1) % n`.

Write a function that returns the position of the child with the ball after `k` seconds.

### Function Signature
```python
def child_with_ball(n: int, k: int) -> int:
    pass
```

### Example
- **Input:** `n = 5, k = 2`
- **Output:** `2`

### Constraints
- `1 <= n <= 1000`
- `1 <= k <= 10^9`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Do we always start with the ball at position `0`?
   **A:** Yes, the ball always starts at position `0`.

2. **Q:** Are the children numbered consecutively starting from `0`?
   **A:** Yes, they are numbered consecutively from `0` to `n-1`.

3. **Q:** Is the ball always passed in increasing order of children numbers?
   **A:** Yes, the ball is passed to the next child in the sequence `(i+1) % n`.

## Strategy

Given that we need to determine the position of the child after `k` seconds with `n` children, we can use the properties of the modulo operation to simplify our task:

1. Start with the initial position of the ball at `0`.
2. Each second, the ball moves from `i` to `(i+1) % n`.
3. After `k` seconds, the position of the ball can be determined by:
   - The initial position `0` plus `k` positions forward.
   - Taking modulo `n`, i.e., `(0 + k) % n`, which simplifies to `k % n`.

Thus, the position of the child who has the ball after `k` seconds is effectively `k % n`.

## Time Complexity

- The computation involves a simple modulo operation, making the time complexity `O(1)`.

## Code

```python
def child_with_ball(n: int, k: int) -> int:
    return k % n
```

Let's break down an example:
- For `n = 5` and `k = 2`, the ball moves two positions from `0`:
  - Position after `1` second: `1`
  - Position after `2` seconds: `2`
  So, `child_with_ball(5, 2) = 2`.

We can see that modulo operation directly gives us this value.
