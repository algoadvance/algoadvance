title:  Minimum Deletions to Make String Balanced-out
permalink: /s1653
---

Given a string `s` consisting only of characters `'a'` and `'b'`, you can delete any number of characters from the string. The goal is to make the string balanced. A string is considered balanced if there are no `'b'` characters before any `'a'` characters. Determine the minimum number of deletions needed to make the string balanced.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Length of String:** What is the maximum length of string `s`? 
   - This helps to determine if there are constraints that could influence the efficiency of the solution.

2. **Edge Cases:** What should be the output for an empty string or a string with all 'a's or all 'b's?
   - For instance, an already balanced string should require zero deletions.

### Strategy

1. **Define the Problem in Terms of Prefix and Suffix:** We aim to find the minimum point where the split of 'a's and 'b's would require the least deletions:
   - Traverse through the string while counting the number of 'a's found up to each point.
   - Similarly, count the number of 'b's found from each point till the end.
   - Find the split point where the sum of deletions required is minimized.

2. **Efficient Calculation Using Two Passes:**
   - First pass to count the number of 'b's from each point to the end.
   - Second pass to adjust counts dynamically as we traverse and shift the boundary.

### Code

```python
def minimumDeletions(s: str) -> int:
    n = s.length
    if n == 0:
        return 0

    # Prefix sum array for the number of 'b's from the start to each point.
    b_count = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        b_count[i] = b_count[i + 1] + (1 if s[i] == 'b' else 0)

    a_count = 0
    min_deletions = float('inf')
    
    for i in range(n + 1):
        # `a_count` is for the number of 'a's before the split point `i`.
        # `b_count[i]` is for the number of 'b's after the split point `i`.
        min_deletions = min(min_deletions, a_count + b_count[i])
        if i < n and s[i] == 'a':
            a_count += 1

    return min_deletions

# Example usage
example_string = "aababbab"
print(minimumDeletions(example_string))  # Expected output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

The algorithm involves two linear passes through the string:

1. The first pass constructs the `b_count` array, taking O(n) time.
2. The second pass calculates `min_deletions` while updating `a_count`, also taking O(n) time.

Overall, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is efficient and feasible for a large input size.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is also O(n):

- The `b_count` array requires additional space proportional to the length of the input string.

This solution is both time and space efficient, making it suitable for large strings.
