You are given an integer array `arr` and an integer `d`. In one step, you can jump from index `i` to any index `j` such that:

- `i + 1 <= j <= i + d` and `arr[i] > arr[j]`, or
- `i - 1 >= j >= i - d` and `arr[i] > arr[j]`

In other words, you can only jump to a position `j` if `arr[i] > arr[j]` and the difference in indices between `i` and `j` is at most `d`.

You need to find the maximum number of indices you can visit starting from an index. You can start from any index in `arr`.

Return the maximum number of indices you can visit.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the jumps be non-continuous (skipping elements in between)?**
   - Yes, as long as the conditions on the indices and values are met.

2. **Can I assume the array `arr` will always have integers?**
   - Yes, the array contains integers as per the problem statement.

3. **Will the given d always be within the valid range of indices for array `arr`?**
   - Yes, `d` will be a valid index distance.

4. **Should we consider jumps in both directions (left and right) until d steps?**
   - Yes, you can jump in both directions as long as the conditions are satisfied.

### Strategy

We can solve this problem using dynamic programming with memoization. The idea is to use a recursive function that calculates the maximum number of positions you can visit starting at a given index `i`. We will use a `dp` array to store the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from each index to avoid redundant calculations.

For each index `i`, we will check both possible jump directions (left and right) within the maximum allowed distance `d`. We will move to an index `j` only if `arr[i] > arr[j]`. We will keep track of the farthest we can go from each index by recursively applying this process and memoizing the results.

### Code

```python
def maxJumps(arr, d):
    n = len(arr)
    dp = [-1] * n

    def dfs(i):
        if dp[i] != -1:
            return dp[i]
        max_reach = 1
        for direction in (-1, 1):
            for jump in range(1, d + 1):
                j = i + direction * jump
                if 0 <= j < n and arr[i] > arr[j]:
                    max_reach = max(max_reach, 1 + dfs(j))
                if 0 > j or j >= n or arr[i] <= arr[j]:
                    break
        dp[i] = max_reach
        return dp[i]

    max_indices_visited = max(dfs(i) for i in range(n))
    return max_indices_visited
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution can be analyzed as follows:

- The DFS function visits each index only once, and for each index, it explores at most `2d` potential jumps (both directions up to `d` steps).
- Here, `n` is the length of the array and the DFS is called for each index.
- Therefore, the time complexity is `O(n * d)` since each of the `n` indices is processed with up to `d` additional steps for each index.

The use of memoization ensures that each index is only processed once, leading to an efficient solution overall.
