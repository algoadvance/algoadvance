title:  Path With Minimum Effort-out
permalink: /s1631

You are asked to find a path from the top-left to the bottom-right corner of a 2D grid such that the maximum absolute difference between adjacent cells in any path is minimized.

Formally, you have a 2D grid `heights` of size `m x n`, where each cell contains a non-negative integer representing the height of that cell. A path from `(r1, c1)` to `(r2, c2)` is a sequence of cells such that you can move from one cell to another if and only if they are adjacent in either the horizontal or vertical direction. The minimum effort path is such a path that minimizes the maximum absolute difference between adjacent cells.

Return the minimum effort required for a path from the top-left to the bottom-right corner.

### Example
```python
Input: heights = [
  [1,2,2],
  [3,8,2],
  [5,3,5]]
Output: 2

Input: heights = [
  [1,2,3],
  [3,8,4],
  [5,3,5]]
Output: 1
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. What is the size range of the grid `heights`?
   - The grid dimensions `m` and `n` are such that `1 <= m, n <= 100`.
2. What are the range values for the height of the cells?
   - The height values are non-negative integers, usually constrained, e.g., `0 <= heights[i][j] <= 10^6`.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm or a Binary Search combined with BFS/DFS to find the path with the minimum maximum difference in heights between adjacent cells. Here's the step-by-step strategy:

### Using Dijkstra's Algorithm
1. **Priority Queue**: Use a priority queue (min-heap) to always extend the path with the current minimum effort.
2. **Relaxation**: Keep track of the minimum effort to reach each cell, initialized to infinity (`inf`) for all except the starting cell (0, 0).
3. **Direction Vectors**: Use direction vectors to navigate through the 2D grid (up, down, left, right).
4. **Update Rule**: For each popped cell `(i, j)`, update its neighbors if a smaller effort path is found.
5. **Early Termination**: The first time you reach the bottom-right cell, the current effort is guaranteed to be the minimum.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is `O(m * n * log(m * n))`, where `m` is the number of rows, and `n` is the number of columns. This stems from the number of cells and the operations on the priority queue.

## Code

Here's the implementation of the Dijkstra-based approach:

```python
import heapq

def minimumEffortPath(heights):
    m, n = len(heights), len(heights[0])
    # directions for moving in the grid
    directions = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    
    def in_bounds(x, y):
        return 0 <= x < m and 0 <= y < n
    
    pq = [(0, 0, 0)]  # stores (effort, x, y)
    efforts = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
    efforts[0][0] = 0
    
    while pq:
        effort, x, y = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        if x == m - 1 and y == n - 1:
            return effort
        
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            
            if in_bounds(nx, ny):
                current_effort = max(effort, abs(heights[nx][ny] - heights[x][y]))
                
                if current_effort < efforts[nx][ny]:
                    efforts[nx][ny] = current_effort
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (current_effort, nx, ny))
    
    return 0  # This line should normally not be reached

# Example usage
heights = [
    [1, 2, 2],
    [3, 8, 2],
    [5, 3, 5]
]
print(minimumEffortPath(heights))  # Output: 2
```

By following these steps, you can effectively find the path with the minimum effort from the top-left to the bottom-right corner of the grid.
