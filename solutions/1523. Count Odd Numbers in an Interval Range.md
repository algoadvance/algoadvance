title:  Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range-out
permalink: /s1523

Given two non-negative integers `low` and `high`, return the count of odd numbers between `low` and `high` (inclusive).

### Clarifying Questions
Before we start implementing the solution, let's clarify a few things:
1. Are `low` and `high` always non-negative integers with `0 <= low <= high`?
2. Should the solution be optimized for large values of `low` and `high`?
3. Are there any constraints on the size of `low` and `high`?

Let's assume typical constraints (e.g., values less than \(10^9\)) and that `low` and `high` are valid as per the problem statement.

### Strategy
To determine the count of odd numbers within the interval `[low, high]`, we can follow this approach:

1. **Identify the properties of odd numbers**:
   - An odd number is any number `n` such that `n % 2 != 0`.

2. **Range properties**:
   - If `low` is odd, include it; otherwise, consider the next number (if within bounds).
   - Similarly, if `high` is odd, include it; otherwise, consider the preceding number (if within bounds).

3. **Mathematical deduction**:
   - Count odd numbers from `1` to `high`.
   - Count odd numbers from `1` to `low-1`.
   - The difference between these two counts gives us the number of odd numbers between `low` and `high`.

Given `x`, the number of odd numbers from `1` to `x` is `(x + 1) // 2`.

### Code
Here's the implementation of the above strategy:

```python
def count_odds(low: int, high: int) -> int:
    def count_odds_up_to(x: int) -> int:
        return (x + 1) // 2
    
    return count_odds_up_to(high) - count_odds_up_to(low - 1)

# Example usage
low = 3
high = 7
print(count_odds(low, high))  # Output: 3 (numbers are 3, 5, 7)
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(1)\) as it involves a fixed amount of arithmetic operations irrespective of the input size.

Using this efficient mathematical approach ensures that the solution works optimally even for large values of `low` and `high`.
