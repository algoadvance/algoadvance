title:  Maximum OR-out
permalink: /s2680
---
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. For each operation, you can select any element from `nums` and increase or decrease it by 1.

Your task is to perform exactly `k` operations to maximize the result of a bitwise OR operation across all elements in the array.

Return the maximum bitwise OR result you can achieve after exactly `k` operations.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the size of the array `nums`?**
   - The number of elements in `nums` will determine the feasibility of certain approaches.
   
2. **What are the minimum and maximum values for `k`?**
   - This will help in understanding the potential computational limits we need to consider.

3. **Are there any constraints on the values in the `nums` array?**
   - We need to know the range of integers in the list.

4. **Should we consider edge cases such as an empty array or k=0?**
   - Handling edge cases will ensure the robustness of the code.

### Strategy
The goal is to maximize the bitwise OR result of the array after `k` operations. 

1. **Understand Bitwise OR:**
   - Bitwise OR of two bits is `1` if either of the bits is `1`. Hence, maximizing a number before performing OR will help in maximizing the final result.

2. **Greedy Approach:**
   - We can perform a greedy approach to maximize the bits from the most significant bit (MSB) to the least significant bit (LSB).
   - Target bits that can be turned to `1` by using the available operations to maximize the OR result.

3. **Simulation:**
   - We will start checking each bit from the most significant position to the least significant, trying to flip as many `0`s to `1`s as possible within the `k` operations limit.

### Code
Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
def maximumOR(nums, k):
    # First, find the current OR result of the array
    current_or = 0
    for num in nums:
        current_or |= num

    # Try to change bits from the most significant to the least significant
    for bit in range(31, -1, -1): # Assuming 32-bit integers
        # calculate how many numbers do not have this bit set and can be incremented
        count_zeros = sum(1 for num in nums if ~(num >> bit) & 1)
        # If we can flip all to 1's, do it
        if count_zeros <= k:
            k -= count_zeros  # Reduce the k by the number of operations we performed
            current_or |= (1 << bit) # Set this bit in the final OR result
    
    return current_or

# Example usage
nums = [1, 2, 4]
k = 2
print(maximumOR(nums, k))  # Output will be the maximum OR result after k operations
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Calculating initial OR:** O(n)
2. **Bitwise operations:** O(n) per bit - Since there are at most 32 bits for a 32-bit integer, it results in O(32 * n) which is effectively O(n).

Thus, the overall time complexity of the approach is **O(n)**.

This approach carefully flips bits to maximize the final OR result by iterating through each bit position, making it both efficient and effective for typical input sizes.
