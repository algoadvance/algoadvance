title:  Shift 2D Grid-out
permalink: /s1260
---

You are given a 2D grid of integers and an integer k. You need to shift the grid k times. In one shift operation:

1. Element at `grid[i][j]` moves to `grid[i][j + 1]`.
2. Element at the end of a row moves to the beginning of the next row.
3. Element at the end of the grid moves to the beginning of the grid.

Return the 2D grid after performing k shift operations.

**Example:**
```
Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], k = 1
Output: [[9,1,2],[3,4,5],[6,7,8]]
```

**Constraints:**
- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m <= 50`
- `1 <= n <= 50`
- `-1000 <= grid[i][j] <= 1000`
- `0 <= k <= 100`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What should be done with zero or invalid k values?
   - **A:** If `k` is zero, the grid should be returned as is. 
   
2. **Q:** How should negative integers in the grid be handled?
   - **A:** The grid elements are within `-1000` and `1000`, and our operations do not need to handle them differently.

3. **Q:** Can k be larger than the number of elements in the grid?
   - **A:** Yes, k can be larger. We should use `k % (m * n)` to optimize the number of actual shifts needed.

### Strategy

1. **Flatten the Grid:** Convert the 2D grid to a 1D list for easier manipulation.
2. **Determine Effective Shifts:** Optimize `k` shifts by computing `k % total_elements`.
3. **Shift the Grid:** Perform the shift on the 1D list.
4. **Reconstruct the Grid:** Convert the shifted 1D list back to a 2D grid format.

### Code

```python
from typing import List

def shiftGrid(grid: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Get dimensions of the grid
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    # Flatten the grid
    flat_grid = [grid[i][j] for i in range(m) for j in range(n)]
    # Total number of elements in the grid
    total_elements = m * n
    # Optimize k
    k = k % total_elements
    
    if k == 0:
        return grid
    
    # Perform the shift
    flat_grid = flat_grid[-k:] + flat_grid[:-k]
    
    # Reconstruct the shifted grid
    new_grid = [
        [flat_grid[i * n + j] for j in range(n)]
        for i in range(m)
    ]
    return new_grid

# Example usage
grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
k = 1
print(shiftGrid(grid, k))  # Output: [[9,1,2],[3,4,5],[6,7,8]]
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Flattening the Grid:** O(m*n)
2. **Shifting the List:** O(m*n)
3. **Reconstructing the Grid:** O(m*n)

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(m*n)`, which is efficient given the constraints.
