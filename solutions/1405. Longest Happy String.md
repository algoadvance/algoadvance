title:  Longest Happy String-out
permalink: /s1405
---

Given three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` which represent the number of letters 'a', 'b', and 'c' that we have, you need to output the longest possible string containing these letters such that no three consecutive characters are the same. Note that "aaabbb" is not allowed because it contains three consecutive 'a's and three consecutive 'b's. The string should not contain more than two consecutive 'a's, 'b's, or 'c's.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are `a`, `b`, and `c` guaranteed to be non-negative?**
   - Yes, `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers.

2. **What should be returned if all three values are zero?**
   - An empty string should be returned as there are no letters available.

3. **Is there a constraint on the maximum value of `a`, `b`, and `c`?**
   - Yes, each of `a`, `b`, and `c` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to 100.

## Strategy

1. **Create a Max-Heap:** 
   - Use a max-heap to always take the character with the largest remaining count.
   
2. **Appending to String:**
   - Use a loop to keep constructing the result by appending characters.
   - Always ensure that no three consecutive characters are the same.

3. **Order Management:**
   - After adding characters, adjust the heap accordingly to keep track of the remaining counts.

4. **Edge Handling:**
   - Handle edge cases where we have to place characters in a way to avoid getting stuck with an invalid sequence.

## Time Complexity

- Building the heap takes O(1) since there are at most 3 elements.
- Each insertion and reordering in the heap takes O(log 3) = O(1).
- Thus, generating the string of length `a + b + c` takes O(a + b + c) time.

Here is the Python code that implements the above strategy:

```python
import heapq

def longestDiverseString(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> str:
    max_heap = []
    
    # Pushing only those characters that have counts > 0
    if a > 0:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-a, 'a'))
    if b > 0:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-b, 'b'))
    if c > 0:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-c, 'c'))
    
    result = []
    
    while max_heap:
        first_cnt, first_char = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
        
        if len(result) >= 2 and result[-1] == result[-2] == first_char:
            if not max_heap:
                break
            
            second_cnt, second_char = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            result.append(second_char)
            second_cnt += 1
            
            if second_cnt != 0:
                heapq.heappush(max_heap, (second_cnt, second_char))
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (first_cnt, first_char))
        else:
            result.append(first_char)
            first_cnt += 1
            
            if first_cnt != 0:
                heapq.heappush(max_heap, (first_cnt, first_char))
    
    return "".join(result)

# Example usage:
a, b, c = 1, 1, 7
print(longestDiverseString(a, b, c))  # Output could vary like "ccaccbcc"
```

This solution ensures that no three consecutive characters are the same by actively managing the character insertion using a max-heap, and making adjustments when necessary to maintain the required conditions.
