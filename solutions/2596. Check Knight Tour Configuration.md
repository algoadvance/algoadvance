title:  Check Knight Tour Configuration-out
permalink: /s2596

### Problem Statement

A knight on an n x n chessboard performs a valid tour if it visits every cell exactly once. Given an n x n integer matrix grid of the knight's tour, return true if the grid represents a valid tour. Otherwise, return false.

The knight moves either:
- Two squares in a horizontal direction and then one square in a vertical direction.
- Two squares in a vertical direction and then one square in a horizontal direction.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of n?** 
   - n can range from 1 to 1000, based on typical constraints.
2. **Are the values in the matrix guaranteed to be unique?**
   - Yes, the values in the matrix represent the order of the knight's tour, so each value will be unique and range from 0 to n^2 - 1.

### Strategy

To validate the knight's tour, we need to ensure that each cell in the matrix grid can only be reached from the previous cell using a valid knight's move. Here's how we'll do it:

1. **Extract Position Data:** 
   - Store the coordinates of each cell in a dictionary where the key is the value (0 to n^2 - 1) and the value is the coordinate (row, column).

2. **Validate Moves:**
   - Iterate through the dictionary in order of the knight's tour and ensure each move from the current cell to the next cell is a valid knight's move.
   
3. **Knight's Move Validation:**
   - Define all possible moves of a knight from any position (like a set to avoid hardcoding every move repeatedly).

### Code

Hereâ€™s the Python code to solve this problem:

```python
def checkValidGrid(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    # Direction vectors for knight moves
    knight_moves = [
        (2, 1), (2, -1), 
        (-2, 1), (-2, -1), 
        (1, 2), (1, -2), 
        (-1, 2), (-1, -2)
    ]
    
    # Dict to map tour index to coordinates
    positions = {}
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            positions[grid[i][j]] = (i, j)
    
    # Check the sequence of knight"s moves
    for k in range(n * n - 1):
        curr_pos = positions[k]
        next_pos = positions[k + 1]
        valid_move = False
        for move in knight_moves:
            if (curr_pos[0] + move[0], curr_pos[1] + move[1]) == next_pos:
                valid_move = True
                break
        if not valid_move:
            return False
    
    return True

# Example usage
grid = [
    [0, 59, 38, 33, 30, 17, 8, 63],
    [37, 34, 31, 60, 9, 62, 29, 16],
    [58, 1, 36, 39, 32, 27, 18, 7],
    [35, 48, 41, 26, 61, 10, 15, 28],
    [42, 57, 2, 49, 40, 23, 6, 19],
    [47, 50, 45, 54, 25, 20, 11, 14],
    [56, 43, 52, 3, 22, 13, 24, 5],
    [51, 46, 55, 44, 53, 4, 21, 12]
]

print(checkValidGrid(grid))  # Output should be True for a valid tour
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) where n is the dimension of the grid. This is because:
- We iterate through each cell in the grid to populate the `positions` dictionary, which takes O(n^2) time.
- We then iterate through all knight moves, which are fixed at 8, making the validation step effectively O(n^2).

This solution provides an efficient check for whether the given grid is a valid knight's tour.
