title:  Type of Triangle-out
permalink: /s3024
---

You are given three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the lengths of the sides of a triangle. You need to determine and print the type of triangle based on the lengths of its sides.

The possible outputs are:
- "Equilateral" if all three sides are equal.
- "Isosceles" if exactly two sides are equal.
- "Scalene" if all three sides are different.

#### Constraints
- The integers will be positive.
- The input values will always form a valid triangle.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Will the side lengths be positive integers?
   - Yes, the problem statement mentions they are positive integers.

2. Do we need to handle input validation, or can we assume the input is always valid?
   - We can assume the input is valid and the given sides always form a valid triangle.

## Strategy

1. **Check for Equilateral Triangle**: If all three sides `a`, `b`, and `c` are equal, then print "Equilateral".
2. **Check for Isosceles Triangle**: If exactly two sides are equal, then print "Isosceles".
3. **Check for Scalene Triangle**: If all three sides are different, then print "Scalene".

Since the problem guarantees the input forms a valid triangle, we don't need to perform additional validity checks for the side lengths.

## Code

```python
def triangle_type(a: int, b: int, c: int) -> str:
    if a == b == c:
        return "Equilateral"
    elif a == b or b == c or a == c:
        return "Isosceles"
    else:
        return "Scalene"

# Example usage:
print(triangle_type(3, 3, 3))  # Should print "Equilateral"
print(triangle_type(2, 2, 3))  # Should print "Isosceles"
print(triangle_type(3, 4, 5))  # Should print "Scalene"
```

## Time Complexity

The function performs a constant number of comparisons and operations, hence the time complexity is `O(1)` (constant time).

This solution is efficient and straightforward given the constraints of the problem.
