title:  Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters-out
permalink: /s3
---
Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Is the input string `s` composed of only ASCII characters?**
   - Yes, for simplicity, we assume `s` is composed of ASCII characters.
2. **Can the input string be empty?**
   - Yes, and if it is empty, the output should be 0.
3. **Should the function consider case sensitivity?**
   - Yes, substrings are case-sensitive (e.g., 'A' and 'a' are different characters).

### Strategy:
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the sliding window technique along with a hash map. The idea is to use two pointers (`start` and `end`) to represent the current window, and a variable to track the maximum length found.

1. Initialize a dictionary (`char_map`) to store the most recent index of each character.
2. Initialize two pointers, `start` and `end`, both set to 0, and a variable `max_length` to 0.
3. Expand the `end` pointer to iterate through the string:
   - If `end` character is already in the map and its index is not less than `start`, update `start` to be one plus the index of the repeating character.
   - Update the character's index in the map to the current position of `end`.
   - Calculate the length of the current window (`end - start + 1`) and update `max_length` if it's greater than the previous `max_length`.
4. Continue this until `end` reaches the end of the string.
5. Return `max_length`.

### Code:

```python
def length_of_longest_substring(s: str) -> int:
    char_map = {}
    start = 0
    max_length = 0
    
    for end in range(len(s)):
        if s[end] in char_map and char_map[s[end]] >= start:
            start = char_map[s[end]] + 1
        
        char_map[s[end]] = end
        max_length = max(max_length, end - start + 1)
        
    return max_length
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. Each character is processed at most twice (once in the `end` pointer and possibly once in the `start` pointer).
- **Space Complexity:** O(min(n, m)), where `m` is the number of possible characters. In the worst case, the dictionary will contain `m` unique characters, but typically it contains up to `n` characters of the string.

By using the sliding window approach, we ensure that we check each character in the string only a minimal number of times, making the solution efficient and scalable for longer strings.
