[3028. Ant on the Boundary-out](https://leetcode.cn/problems/ant-on-the-boundary/)

An ant is placed on a `width x height` grid. 

- The top-left corner of the grid is represented as `(0, 0)`, and the bottom-right corner is represented as `(width - 1, height - 1)`.
- The ant starts at a point `(x, y)` within the grid. Each second, it can only move one unit left, right, up, or down.
- If the ant moves to a boundary location and then immediately tries to move out of the grid, it can't and will stay in its current position.
- The boundary of the grid is any position of the form `(0, i)`, `(width - 1, i)`, `(i, 0)`, or `(i, height - 1)` for any valid `i`.

Given the grid dimensions (`width` and `height`), the starting point `(x, y)`, and a list of integer steps `steps`, determine after how many seconds the ant will first be at the boundary.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the ant start on the boundary?**
   - Yes, the ant can start on the boundary.
   
2. **What happens if the ant is already on the boundary at the start?**
   - It is considered to be on the boundary at time `0`.

3. **Are the steps for the ant strictly one per second?**
   - Yes, each unit movement happens per second.

4. **What should be returned if the ant never reaches the boundary within the given steps?**
   - If the ant never reaches the boundary within the given steps, we should return the number of steps.

## Strategy

1. **Initial Check**:
   - First, check if the starting point `(x, y)` is already on the boundary. If so, return `0`.

2. **Simulate the Ant's Movement**:
   - We'll simulate the ant's movement step by step using BFS until the ant reaches any boundary.

3. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - All movements should be checked to make sure they stay within the grid boundary.

4. **Directional Movements**:
   - Define possible ant movements: left, right, up, down.

5. **Queue for BFS**:
   - Use a queue to keep track of the ant's position and the time elapsed.

6. **Visit Tracking**:
   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles.

## Code

```python
from collections import deque

def time_to_boundary(width, height, x, y, steps):
    # Check if already at the boundary
    if x == 0 or x == width - 1 or y == 0 or y == height - 1:
        return 0

    # Possible directions (left, right, up, down)
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    
    # Initialize the queue with the starting position and time = 0
    queue = deque([(x, y, 0)])
    visited = set((x, y))

    while queue:
        cx, cy, time = queue.popleft()
        
        if time > steps:
            break
        
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = cx + dx, cy + dy
            
            if 0 <= nx < width and 0 <= ny < height and (nx, ny) not in visited:
                # Check if the next position is a boundary position
                if nx == 0 or nx == width - 1 or ny == 0 or ny == height - 1:
                    return time + 1
                
                # Mark the new position as visited and add to the queue
                visited.add((nx, ny))
                queue.append((nx, ny, time + 1))
    
    return steps

# Example Usage:
width = 5
height = 5
x = 2
y = 2
steps = 10

print(time_to_boundary(width, height, x, y, steps))  # Expected output should be the time when it hits the boundary based on steps allowed
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of steps as the BFS traverses up to the number of specified steps.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), as the queue and visited set track the positions traversal within those steps.

This algorithm efficiently simulates the ant's movement and determines the first time it hits the boundary.
