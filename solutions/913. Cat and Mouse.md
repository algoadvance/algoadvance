title:  Cat and Mouse-out

The problem is about a game involving a cat, a mouse, and a set of holes for the mouse to hide. The game is played on a graph. The mouse starts at node `1`, and the cat starts at node `2`. The graph is an undirected graph with nodes numbered from `0` to `n-1` and an array `graph`, where `graph[i]` is a list of all the nodes `i` is connected to.

The game goes as follows:

- The mouse moves first, then they take turns to move.
- Either the mouse or the cat can stay in its current position, or move to one of its neighboring nodes.
- The cat cannot move to the node `0`, representing the hole since it's safe for the mouse.
- If the mouse reaches the node `0`, it wins the game.
- If the cat catches the mouse (i.e., both at the same node excluding `0`), the cat wins the game.
- If they stay in a loop where states keep recurring, the result is a draw.

The problem is to determine the outcome of the game given the starting positions of the cat and mouse:
- 0 if the mouse wins.
- 1 if the cat wins.
- 2 if the result is a draw.

You need to implement the function:

```python
def catMouseGame(graph: List[List[int]]) -> int:
```

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Graph Representation**: We assume the graph is represented with an adjacency list, where `graph[i]` is a list of nodes connected to node `i`.
2. **Initial State**: The mouse starts at node `1`, and the cat starts at node `2`.
3. **Draw Definition**: The game results in a draw if the states reoccur indefinitely.

### Strategy:

The game can be modeled as a recursive problem that involves exploration of possible moves by both the cat and the mouse. We can use dynamic programming to keep track of states that have been solved to avoid redundant computations and to detect cycles. Here are the key components:

1. **State Representation**: The state can be represented as `(mouse_position, cat_position, turn)`, where `turn` indicates whose turn it is to move (`0` for mouse, `1` for cat).
2. **Memoization**: Utilize a memoization table to store the results of state evaluations to prevent recomputation and to identify draw situations.
3. **Base Cases**:
    - If the mouse reaches node `0`, it wins (return `0`).
    - If the cat catches the mouse, the cat wins (return `1`).
4. **Recursive Exploration**: For each state `(m, c, t)`, recursively explore all possible moves and determine whether the current player can force a win or if the game results in a draw.

We will propagate the win/lose status back through recursive calls which will help us determine the outcome of the game from the starting state.

### Code:

```python
def catMouseGame(graph: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    from collections import deque
    
    DRAW = 0
    MOUSE_WIN = 1
    CAT_WIN = 2
    
    n = len(graph)
    dp = [[[-1] * 3 for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    
    def dfs(mouse, cat, turn):
        if dp[mouse][cat][turn] != -1:
            return dp[mouse][cat][turn]
        
        if mouse == 0:
            dp[mouse][cat][turn] = MOUSE_WIN
        elif mouse == cat:
            dp[mouse][cat][turn] = CAT_WIN
        else:
            if turn == 0:  # Mouse's turn
                result = CAT_WIN
                for next_mouse in graph[mouse]:
                    res = dfs(next_mouse, cat, 1 - turn)
                    if res == MOUSE_WIN:
                        result = MOUSE_WIN
                        break
                    if res == DRAW:
                        result = DRAW
                dp[mouse][cat][turn] = result
            else:  # Cat's turn
                result = MOUSE_WIN
                for next_cat in graph[cat]:
                    if next_cat == 0:
                        continue
                    res = dfs(mouse, next_cat, 1 - turn)
                    if res == CAT_WIN:
                        result = CAT_WIN
                        break
                    if res == DRAW:
                        result = DRAW
                dp[mouse][cat][turn] = result
        return dp[mouse][cat][turn]
    
    result = dfs(1, 2, 0)
    return 1 if result == CAT_WIN else 2 if result == DRAW else 0
```

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n^3)` in the worst case, where `n` is the number of nodes in the graph. This is due to the three-dimensional state space `(mouse_position, cat_position, turn)` and filling out the DP table. Each state is visited and computed at most once due to memoization.
