title:  Most Profitable Path in a Tree-out
permalink: /s2467
---

You are given a tree (an undirected, connected, acyclic graph) with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n-1` and an array `amount` of size `n` where `amount[i]` is the amount of money you can get from the `i-th` node. The tree is described by a 2D array `edges` of size `n-1` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi`. 

Your goal is to find the most profitable path in the tree starting from node `0` such that:

1. You can choose any node as the destination for the path.
2. You can traverse each node at most once.
3. The profit at each node is added to the total profit.

Return the maximum total profit you can achieve.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the amount at each node be negative?
   **A:** Yes, the amount at each node can be negative.
   
2. **Q:** Are all nodes guaranteed to be connected?
   **A:** Yes, since it's a tree, all nodes are connected.

3. **Q:** Should we consider any particular constraints for the tree size?
   **A:** The input size will fit within typical constraints for such problems; no need for special optimizations beyond O(n).

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to traverse the tree starting from node `0`. We will explore all paths and keep track of the maximum profit encountered.

1. **Graph Representation:** Use an adjacency list to represent the tree and ease traversal.
2. **DFS Traversal:** Implement a DFS function to explore all nodes while maintaining the total profit.
3. **Track Visited Nodes:** Track visited nodes to avoid cycles.
4. **Update Maximum Profit:** Continuously update the maximum profit whenever we reach a new node.

### Code

```python
def mostProfitablePath(edges, amount):
    from collections import defaultdict

    # Step 1: Build the adjacency list for the tree.
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        tree[v].append(u)
    
    def dfs(node, visited):
        visited.add(node)
        max_profit = amount[node]
        
        for neighbor in tree[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                # Recursive DFS call
                current_profit = dfs(neighbor, visited)
                # Only consider valid paths that add to our profit
                max_profit = max(max_profit, amount[node] + current_profit)
        
        visited.remove(node)
        return max_profit
    
    # Initialize DFS with node 0
    visited = set()
    return dfs(0, visited)

# Example usage:
edges = [[0,1], [0,2], [1,3], [1,4], [2,5], [2,6]]
amount = [3, 2, 1, -2, -1, 4, 5]
print(mostProfitablePath(edges, amount))  # Example output
```

### Explanation
1. **Graph Construction:** We build an adjacency list `tree` representing the graph.
2. **DFS Function:** The `dfs` function performs a depth-first search, calculating the maximum profit for each route.
3. **Profit Calculation:** We recursively calculate the profit for all reachable nodes and update the maximum profit during the traversal.

### Time Complexity
- **Graph Construction:** \(O(n)\) because we iterate over each of the \(n-1\) edges.
- **DFS Traversal:** \(O(n)\) because each node and each edge is visited exactly once in a depth-first search.

**Overall Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
