Leetcode problem 1702: Maximum Binary String After Change

You are given a binary string `binary` consisting only of characters '0' and '1'. 

In one operation, you can choose two different indices `i` and `j` where `i < j` and `element i` is '0' and `element j` is '1', then you can change `binary[i]` to '1' and `binary[j]` to '0'.

Return the maximum binary string you can obtain after any number of operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length range of the binary string?**
   - The length of the binary string is between 1 and \(10^5\).
   
2. **What should be done if the string is already the maximum binary string?**
   - If the string is already the maximum possible binary string, you should return it as it is.
   
3. **How do we define the "maximum" binary string?**
   - A binary string is considered "maximum" if it contains as many '1's at the beginning of the string as possible followed by as few '0's as possible.

### Strategy

1. **Count the Zeros:**
   - Iterate through the string to count the number of '0's.
   
2. **Count the Zeros Before First One:**
   - Count the number of '0's before the first '1' since these cannot be directly flipped by the described operation.

3. **Reconstruct Maximum Binary String:**
   - After flipping all possible '0's to '1's (while leaving one '0' to account for the first zero which can't be optimized), re-construct the final string with as many '1's as possible followed by a single '0' at the end.

### Code

```python
def maximumBinaryString(binary: str) -> str:
    # Count the number of zeros in the string
    zero_count = binary.count('0')
    
    # Edge case: If there are no zeros, return the input as it's already maximized.
    if zero_count == 0:
        return binary
    
    # Find the first occurrence of '0' to count the zeros before any '1'
    first_zero_index = binary.find('0')
    leading_zeros = 0
    for i in range(first_zero_index):
        if binary[i] == '0':
            leading_zeros += 1
    
    # Compute the number of ones that will be at the beginning
    ones_count = len(binary) - zero_count
    
    # Construct the final maximum binary string
    result = '1' * (ones_count + zero_count - 1) + '0' + '1' * (zero_count - 1 - leading_zeros)
    
    return result
```

### Time Complexity
- **O(n)**: The solution involves counting '0's, find the first '0', and some arithmetic calculations. This will take linear time relative to the length of the input string `n`.

### Explanation

1. **Count Zeros:**
   - Count the total number of '0's in the string.
   
2. **Count Leading Zeros:**
   - Determine how many '0's exist before the first '1' appears, understanding their position impacts flipping ability.
   
3. **Compute Length of '1's:** 
   - Calculation of the length of the run of '1's in the final string.
   
4. **Construct Result:**
   - Build the desired string according to the counts of '1's and '0's, constructing a maximum binary string accordingly. 

This approach ensures we gather the most '1's possible in the front, transforming the binary string as required.
