title:  First Missing Positive-out

Given an unsorted integer array `nums`, return the smallest missing positive integer.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Is the input array limited by size (e.g., up to a certain number of elements)?**
   - Assume the size can be up to a few thousand elements.
2. **Are there any constraints on the values within the array?**
   - The values can be any integer, positive, negative, or zero.
3. **What should be the output if the array contains all positive integers up to some number n?**
   - The output should be `n + 1`.

### Strategy:
1. **Target Values:** We're only interested in finding the first missing positive integer, so we can ignore negative numbers and numbers greater than the length of the array since the first missing positive must be in the range `1` to `len(nums) + 1`.
   
2. **Place Numbers in Correct Positions:** Use the indices of the array to place each number in its correct position, i.e., `nums[i]` should be at the position `nums[i] - 1` if it's in the range `[1, len(nums)]`. This will help us easily spot the missing number.

3. **Find the Missing Positive:** After rearranging the numbers, the first index where the number isn't `i + 1` (where `i` is the index) will give the smallest missing positive number.

### Code:
```python
def firstMissingPositive(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    n = len(nums)
    
    # Step 1: Place each number in its correct position if it's in the range 1 to n.
    for i in range(n):
        while 1 <= nums[i] <= n and nums[nums[i] - 1] != nums[i]:
            # Swap the numbers to their correct positions
            nums[nums[i] - 1], nums[i] = nums[i], nums[nums[i] - 1]
    
    # Step 2: Identify the first position where the index does not match the value
    for i in range(n):
        if nums[i] != i + 1:
            return i + 1
    
    # If all indices match, the missing number is n + 1
    return n + 1
```

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input array. This is because each number is moved at most once.

### Explanation of Code:
1. **First Loop (Placement):** We iterate through the array, and for each element, if it's between 1 and `n`, and not already in its correct position, we swap it with the element in its target position until every element is either out of range or in its right place.
   
2. **Second Loop (Identification):** We then go through the array to check if the element at each index `i` is `i + 1`. The first index where this isn't true is our answer.

3. If all positions are correct, then the array contains all numbers from 1 to `n`, and hence the first missing positive is `n + 1`.
