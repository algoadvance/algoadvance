title:  Minimize Manhattan Distances-out
permalink: /s3102
---

You are given `n` points in a 2-dimensional plane. The goal is to select a subset of these points such that their sum of their Manhattan distances to a given point is minimized.

More formally, youâ€™re given an array `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents point `(xi, yi)` on a 2D plane. You need to find a point `(a, b)` such that the sum of Manhattan distances from all `n` points to `(a, b)` is minimized.

The Manhattan distance between two points `(xi, yi)` and `(a, b)` is defined as `|xi - a| + |yi - b|`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are there any constraints on the coordinates? (e.g., maximum values for `xi` and `yi`)
2. Can there be duplicate points in the input list?
3. Do points need to be selected from the given points, or can we choose any `(a, b)` in the plane?
4. When there are multiple such points `(a, b)` giving the same minimal sum, can we return any of them?

### Strategy

The Manhattan Distance, for a given set of points, can be minimized by selecting the median of the x-coordinates and y-coordinates from the given points. Here's why:

- The Manhattan distance between two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is `|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|`.
- To minimize `|xi - a|` for a set of x-coordinates, the best choice for `a` is the median of these x-coordinates.
- Similarly, to minimize `|yi - b|` for a set of y-coordinates, the best choice for `b` is the median of these y-coordinates.

Given this observation, the approach can be broken down as:
1. Extract the x-coordinates and y-coordinates from the points.
2. Compute the median of these x-coordinates and y-coordinates.
3. The point `(median_x, median_y)` will minimize the Manhattan distance sum.

### Code

Here's the Python code to compute this:

```python
from typing import List

def minimize_manhattan_distance(points: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
    if not points:
        return []

    # Extract x and y coordinates separately
    x_coords = [point[0] for point in points]
    y_coords = [point[1] for point in points]

    # Sort the coordinates to find the median
    x_coords.sort()
    y_coords.sort()

    # Find the median. If n is even, choose the lower median to align with problem requirements.
    n = len(points)
    median_x = x_coords[(n - 1) // 2]
    median_y = y_coords[(n - 1) // 2]

    return [median_x, median_y]

# Example usage:
points = [[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]
print(minimize_manhattan_distance(points))
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is primarily determined by the time it takes to sort the coordinates:
- Extracting x and y coordinates individually takes \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the number of points.
- Sorting these coordinates each takes \(O(n \log n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is:
\[ O(n \log n) \]

This is efficient for a large number of points and should handle typical constraints well.
