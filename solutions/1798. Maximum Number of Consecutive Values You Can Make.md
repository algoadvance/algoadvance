title:  Maximum Number of Consecutive Values You Can Make-out
permalink: /s1798

You are given a sorted integer array `coins` of length `n` that represents the values of coins you have. You can use these coins to form any amount of money, starting from 0. The task is to determine the maximum number of consecutive integer amounts you can form using the coins in the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Sorted Array**:
   - The problem states that the array is already sorted. This means we don't need to sort it ourselves.
   
2. **Values in the Array**:
   - Are the values in the array positive integers only? (This is typically implied but it's good to confirm).
   
3. **Output**:
   - We need to find the maximum number of consecutive integers starting from 0 that can be formed using the given coins.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with an initial value `current_max` set to 0. This tracks the maximum integer value we can form so far.

2. **Iterate Through the Array**:
   - For each coin in the array, check if it is greater than `current_max + 1`.
   - If the coin is greater than `current_max + 1`, we cannot form `current_max + 1` because there is a gap.
   - If the coin is less than or equal to `current_max + 1`, update `current_max` to include this coin. Specifically, that means setting `current_max` to `current_max + coin`.

3. **Completion**:
   - Continue this process through the array and at the end, `current_max` will be the maximum number of consecutive values starting from 0 that can be formed.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, since we are iterating through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as we are using only a fixed amount of additional space.

### Code

```python
def getMaximumConsecutive(coins):
    current_max = 0
    for coin in coins:
        if coin > current_max + 1:
            break
        current_max += coin
    return current_max + 1
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Condition**: Start with `current_max = 0`.
- **Iteration**:
  - For each coin in the sorted list, check if the coin is greater than `current_max + 1`.
  - If it is, it means there is a gap and we cannot form `current_max + 1`.
  - If it isn't, add the coin to `current_max` (i.e., update `current_max`).
- **Return Statement**: Finally, return `current_max + 1`, since this represents the maximum number of consecutive values from 0 that can be formed.

### Example

```python
coins = [1, 1, 1, 4]
print(getMaximumConsecutive(coins))  # Output: 8
```

Explanation:
- Start: `current_max = 0`
- First coin 1: `current_max = 1`
- Second coin 1: `current_max = 2`
- Third coin 1: `current_max = 3`
- Fourth coin 4: Since 4 > 3 + 1, but because we can create up to 3, we can form `3 + 4 = 7`
- End result: 7 + 1 = 8
