title:  Check if Number Has Equal Digit Count and Digit Value-out
permalink: /s2283
---
You are given a digit string `num`. You need to determine if the count of each digit in the string matches its value. Specifically, for each digit at index `i` in the string, the count of digit `i` in the entire string should match the digit's value at that index. Return 'True' if the string satisfies this condition, otherwise return 'False'.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. What is the range of the length of the string `num`?
   - The length of the string can be up to 10.
2. Can the string contain any non-digit characters?
   - No, the string contains only digits from '0' to '9'.
3. Should the function be case-sensitive?
   - Since the string contains only digits, case sensitivity is not relevant.

### Code:
```python
def digit_count(num: str) -> bool:
    # Create a dictionary to hold the count of each digit
    from collections import Counter
    digit_counts = Counter(num)
    
    # Traverse through each digit
    for i in range(len(num)):
        # Check if the count of the digit i (converted to string) matches num[i] (converted to int)
        if digit_counts[str(i)] != int(num[i]):
            return False
    
    return True

# Example tests
print(digit_count("1210"))  # True
print(digit_count("030"))   # False
```

### Strategy:
1. **Use a Counter**: Utilize the `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the instances of each character (digit) in the string `num`.
2. **Iterate through String**: Loop through each index `i` of the string `num`.
3. **Compare Counts**: For each index `i`, check if the count of the digit `str(i)` in the Counter equals the integer value of `num[i]`.
4. **Return Result**: If all checks pass, return `True`. If any check fails, return `False`.

### Time Complexity:
- **Building the Counter**: O(n), where n is the length of `num`, to count the frequency of each digit.
- **Iterating and Checking**: O(n), to loop through each index in the string and check the counts.
- **Overall Complexity**: O(n), since both the major operations (counting and checking) are linear in terms of the length of `num`.

The provided solution is efficient and well within the acceptable limits for the problem constraints.
