title:  Minimum Suffix Flips-out
permalink: /s1529
---

Given a binary string `target`, find the minimum number of suffix flips needed to convert `target` to a string of all '0's.

A "suffix flip" means choosing an index `j` and flipping the suffix starting at `j`, which means all elements from `target[j]` to the end of the array change from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.

You need to determine the minimum number of flips.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What does "flipping" mean?**
   Flipping a suffix means inverting all the bits from index `j` to the end of the string. For example, flipping the suffix starting at index 2 in the string `1001` would change it to `1010`.

2. **What is the output?**
   The output is the minimum number of such flips needed to make the entire string `target` composed only of '0's.

3. **Constraints?**
   - The length of `target` is between 1 and 10^5.
   - `target` consists only of the characters '0' and '1'.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Observation:**
   Each time you encounter a transition from '0' to '1' or '1' to '0' in the `target`, it indicates a potential flip point because flipping from that transition can help change the remaining part to the desired form ('0' in this case).

2. **Steps:**
   - Traverse the string to track transitions.
   - Increase the flip count each time there is a transition from `0` to `1` or `1` to `0`.

3. **Example:**
   For `target = "0010"`, the analysis is:
   - From the start, you have '00' (No flip needed).
   - At index 2, you see '1' (A flip is needed starting from index 2).
   - At index 3, you see '0' (Another flip is needed starting from index 3).
   - Total flips: 2.

### Code

```python
def minFlips(target: str) -> int:
    # Initialize the count of flips
    flips = 0
    
    # Traverse the target string
    for i in range(1, len(target)):
        # Check if there is a transition from previous character to current character
        if target[i] != target[i-1]:
            flips += 1
    # If the first character is '1', a flip is needed
    if target[0] == '1':
        flips += 1
    
    return flips

# Example usage
target = "0010"
print(minFlips(target))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

- The traversal of the string takes `O(n)` time, where `n` is the length of the string `target`.

- This solution is efficient given the constraint (1 ≤ length of `target` ≤ 100000), hence it's optimal for this problem.
