title:  Check if There is a Valid Partition For The Array-out
permalink: /s2369
---

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. You have to partition the array into one or more contiguous subarrays.

We call a partition of the array valid if each of the obtained subarrays satisfies one of the following conditions:

1. The subarray consists of exactly **2** equal elements. For example, the subarray `[2, 2]` is good.
2. The subarray consists of exactly **3** equal elements. For example, the subarray `[4, 4, 4]` is good.
3. The subarray consists of exactly **3** consecutive increasing elements, that is, the difference between the elements is `1`. For example, the subarray `[3, 4, 5]` is good, but the subarray `[1, 3, 5]` is not.

Return `true` *if the array has at least one valid partition. Otherwise, return `false`*.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the length of the array?**
   - Yes, the length of the array will be at least 2.
2. **What are the possible values in the array?**
   - The values in the array can be any integer within a reasonable range.

3. **Can the subarrays overlap?**
   - No, the subarrays cannot overlap. The array needs to be partitioned in such a way that these subarrays are contiguous and non-overlapping.

4. **Is there a specific way you want the solution to be implemented?**
   - The solution should be efficient, time complexity and clarity of the implementation will be judged.

## Strategy

We'll use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Here's the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Dynamic Programming Array**:
   - Use a boolean array `dp` where `dp[i]` will be `True` if `nums[:i+1]` can be partitioned validly.

2. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize `dp[0]` to `False` (because a single element cannot make a valid subarray under given conditions).
   - `dp[1]` depends on whether `nums[0]` and `nums[1]` are equal.

3. **Filling the DP Array**:
   - Iterate through the array starting from index 2, and for each index, check if there are valid subarrays ending at that index.
   - If a valid partition ending at index `i` exists, set `dp[i]` to `True`.

4. **Conditions to Check**:
   - Subarrays of length 2: Check if `nums[i] == nums[i-1]`.
   - Subarrays of length 3: Check if `nums[i] == nums[i-1] == nums[i-2]` or if the elements form a consecutive increasing sequence `nums[i-2], nums[i-1], nums[i]`.

5. **Result**:
   - The value of `dp[n-1]` will give us our answer for the whole array.

## Code

Here is the Python code to implement the above logic:

```python
def validPartition(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    if n < 2:
        return False
    
    dp = [False] * n

    # Initializing dp for base cases
    if nums[0] == nums[1]:
        dp[1] = True

    for i in range(2, n):
        if nums[i] == nums[i-1]:
            dp[i] = dp[i] or dp[i-2]
        if nums[i] == nums[i-1] == nums[i-2]:
            dp[i] = dp[i] or (i >= 3 and dp[i-3])
        if nums[i] - nums[i-1] == 1 and nums[i-1] - nums[i-2] == 1:
            dp[i] = dp[i] or (i >= 3 and dp[i-3])
    
    return dp[n-1]

# Example Usage
nums = [4, 4, 4, 5, 6]
print(validPartition(nums))  # Output: True
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The solution involves a single pass through the array of length `n`, leading to a time complexity of \(O(n)\).
- **Space Complexity**: The dp array takes \(O(n)\) space.

This approach ensures that we efficiently check for valid partitions without redundant computations.
