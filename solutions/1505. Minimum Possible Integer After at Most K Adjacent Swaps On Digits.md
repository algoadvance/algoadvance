title:  Minimum Possible Integer After at Most K Adjacent Swaps On Digits-out
permalink: /s1505
---
You are given a string `num` representing a large integer and an integer `k`. You need to find the minimum possible integer you can obtain after at most `k` adjacent swaps on the digits of `num`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the length of `num`?**
   - The length of `num` is between 1 and 40, inclusive.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the value of `k`?**
   - `k` is a non-negative integer not greater than the length of `num`.

3. **Can `num` have leading zeros?**
   - No, since `num` represents an integer, no leading zeros should be present except for the number "0" itself.

4. **What kind of digits does `num` contain?**
   - `num` contains only decimal digits ('0'-'9').

### Strategy
1. **Priority Queue**: Use a priority queue (min-heap) to find the smallest possible digit that can be moved to the current position within the allowed number of swaps.
2. **Greedy Approach**: For each digit's position, find the smallest digit within the range of `k` swaps and move it as close to the front as possible without exceeding `k` swaps.
3. **Adjacency Constraint**: Ensure that every swap respects the constraints of adjacent swaps.

### Steps
1. Start from the leftmost digit.
2. Use a heap to track the smallest possible digits within the remaining available swaps.
3. Adjust positions of the digits using the allowed swaps, updating `k` accordingly.
4. Repeat until the entire string is processed or no more swaps can be made.

### Code
```python
def minInteger(num: str, k: int) -> str:
    from heapq import heappop, heappush
    n = len(num)
    
    if k == 0:
        return num
    
    # Create a list of buckets for each digit (0-9)
    digit_positions = [[] for _ in range(10)]
    for i, digit in enumerate(num):
        digit_positions[int(digit)].append(i)

    result = []
    
    # We'll use a `visited` array to mark the positions we've consumed
    visited = [False] * n
    
    # A min-heap to get the earliest position for smallest possible digits
    heap = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        for d in range(10):
            while digit_positions[d] and digit_positions[d][0] < i:
                heappop(digit_positions[d])
            if digit_positions[d]:
                heappush(heap, (digit_positions[d][0], d))
        
        # Get the smallest digit within reach of `k` swaps
        while heap:
            pos, digit = heappop(heap)
            if visited[pos]:
                continue # the position has already been used
            if pos - i <= k:
                k -= (pos - i)
                visited[pos] = True
                result.append(str(digit))
                break
            else:
                heappush(heap, (pos, digit))
    
    # Append remaining digits
    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            result.append(num[i])
    
    return ''.join(result)

# Example Usage:
print(minInteger("4321", 4))  # Output: "1342"
```

### Time Complexity
- The algorithm mainly depends on inserting and removing elements from the heap.
- Each insertion/removal operation in the heap takes \(O(\log k)\).
- Since we iterate through each digit's position once, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), where `n` is the length of the string.

This ensures that we maintain a balance between finding the smallest digits and limiting the amount of swaps as per the given constraint `k`.
