title:  Maximum Value after Insertion-out

Given a string `n` representing a negative or positive integer, insert a digit `x` (0 - 9) into `n` such that the resulting string represents the maximum possible integer. Return the resulting string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input integer `n` be negative?**
   - Yes, `n` can be either positive or negative.
   
2. **Is there an upper or lower limit on the length of the string `n`?**
   - The problem does not specify any particular constraints on the length of `n`, so we assume typical integer length constraints.

3. **Can `n` contain leading zeros or other non-digit characters?**
   - No, `n` will be a valid representation of an integer without leading zeros unless it is "0".

### Strategy

1. **For Positive `n`:**
   - Traverse the string from left to right.
   - Insert `x` before the first character that is less than `x`, as this will maximize the value of the number.
   
2. **For Negative `n`:**
   - Traverse the string from left to right starting after the negative sign.
   - Insert `x` before the first character that is greater than `x`, as this will minimize the decrease in value of the number.

3. **General Approach:**
   - Convert `n` to a list for easier insertion.
   - Handle positive and negative separately according to the above logic.
   - Join the list back into a string for the result.

### Code

```python
def maxValue(n: str, x: int) -> str:
    x = str(x)
    
    if n[0] == '-':
        # n is negative
        for i in range(1, len(n)):
            if n[i] > x:
                return n[:i] + x + n[i:]
        return n + x
    else:
        # n is positive
        for i in range(len(n)):
            if n[i] < x:
                return n[:i] + x + n[i:]
        return n + x

# Examples
print(maxValue("99", 9))  # Output: "999"
print(maxValue("-132", 3))  # Output: "-1323"
```

### Time Complexity

- **Positive `n`:** We traverse the string character by character until we find the optimal insertion point. In the worst-case scenario, this is \(O(k)\) where \(k\) is the length of the string \(n\).
  
- **Negative `n`:** Similarly to the positive case, we traverse the string until we find the optimal insertion point, resulting in the same worst-case time complexity of \(O(k)\).

Overall, the time complexity for this algorithm is \(O(k)\), where \(k\) is the length of the input string \(n\).
