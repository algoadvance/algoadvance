title:  Largest Sum of Averages-out

### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `A` and an integer `K`. You need to partition the array into at most `K` non-empty adjacent subarrays. The score of a partition is the sum of the averages of each subarray. Return the largest score you can achieve.

### Clarifying Questions

To fully understand the problem, we need to clarify:
1. What are the constraints on the values of the array `A` and the integer `K`?
2. Are all the elements in array `A` positive integers, or can they be negative or zero as well?
3. Can `K` be greater than the length of the array `A`?
4. Do we need to consider any edge cases such as empty array or `K` equals 1?

### Assumptions and Constraints
Based on typical coding interview settings:
1. Array `A` can have values ranging from negative to positive integers.
2. The length of array `A` is at least 1.
3. \(1 \leq K \leq \text{length of } A\).

### Strategy

We'll employ a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem:
1. Define \( \text{dp}[i][k] \) as the largest score we can achieve for the first `i` elements with `k` partitions.
2. Use a prefix sum array to store the sum of elements up to any given index, which helps in quickly calculating the average of any subarray.
3. Use nested loops:
   - Outer loop for the number of partitions \( k \) from 1 to `K`.
   - Inner loop for the length of the array \( i \) from 1 to `n`.
   - The innermost loop to choose the partition point and calculate the maximum achievable score at each step.

### Time Complexity
The dynamic programming approach has a time complexity of \( O(n^2 \times K) \) where `n` is the length of the array and `K` is the number of partitions.

This is because:
- There are \( O(n) \) choices for the length.
- For each length, there are `K` partitions to consider.
- For each partition, we might need to traverse the array again which makes it quadratic in the worst case.

### Implementation
Here is the Python code for this solution:

```python
def largestSumOfAverages(A, K):
    n = len(A)
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Calculate prefix sums
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + A[i]
    
    # Initialize dp array
    dp = [[0] * (K + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Base case: 1 partition
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i][1] = prefix_sum[i] / i
        
    # Fill dp array
    for k in range(2, K + 1):  # Number of partitions
        for i in range(1, n + 1):  # Length of array considered
            for j in range(i):  # Partition point
                dp[i][k] = max(dp[i][k], dp[j][k-1] + (prefix_sum[i] - prefix_sum[j]) / (i - j))
    
    return dp[n][K]

# Example usage:
A = [9, 1, 2, 3, 9]
K = 3
print(largestSumOfAverages(A, K))  # Output should be 20
```

### Explanation
1. **Prefix Sum Calculation:** We calculate the prefix sums to help in quick subarray sum calculation.
2. **DP Initialization:** The base case where there is only one partition (i.e., the entire array).
3. **Main DP Loop:** We fill the dp table considering each partition incrementally.
    - For each number of partitions `k`, we consider the possible subarrays and calculate the best partition point to maximize the average.
