title:  Count Pairs With XOR in a Range-out
permalink: /s1803
---

You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `low` and `high`. Return the number of pairs `(i, j)` where `0 <= i < j < nums.length` and `low <= (nums[i] XOR nums[j]) <= high`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the array `nums` and the values within it?**
   - The array `nums` can be of length up to 2 * 10^4.
   - The values in `nums` can range between 0 and 10^9.

2. **Can `nums` contain duplicate values?**
   - Yes, `nums` can contain duplicate values.

3. **Are there any specific constraints that would impact the solution approach (e.g., time complexity constraints)?**
   - Yes, given the potential size of `nums`, a brute-force solution with time complexity O(n^2) is likely infeasible.

### Strategy

To efficiently count the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that `low <= (nums[i] XOR nums[j]) <= high`, we can use a **Trie** to represent the binary digits of the numbers and leverage properties of XOR:

1. **Construct a Trie to keep track of all elements seen so far** in the array.
2. For each number in `nums`, calculate the possible pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` where `0 <= i < j < nums.length`.
   - For each number, we will count how many numbers already present in the Trie when XORed with the current number falls in the range `[low, high]`.

3. **Helper Function**: Create a helper function `count_less_than_xor(x, limit)` that will count numbers in Trie that satisfy a certain XOR condition.

### Code

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.count = 0

class Solution:
    def countPairs(self, nums: List[int], low: int, high: int) -> int:
        def insert(num):
            node = trie
            for i in range(14, -1, -1):
                bit = (num >> i) & 1
                if bit not in node.children:
                    node.children[bit] = TrieNode()
                node = node.children[bit]
                node.count += 1

        def count_less_than_xor(num, limit):
            node = trie
            total_count = 0
            for i in range(14, -1, -1):
                if node is None:
                    break
                num_bit = (num >> i) & 1
                limit_bit = (limit >> i) & 1
                if limit_bit == 1:
                    if num_bit in node.children:
                        total_count += node.children[num_bit].count
                    node = node.children.get(1 - num_bit)
                else:
                    node = node.children.get(num_bit)
            return total_count
        
        trie = TrieNode()
        result = 0
        for num in nums:
            result += count_less_than_xor(num, high + 1) - count_less_than_xor(num, low)
            insert(num)

        return result
```

### Time Complexity

- **Insertion in Trie**: Each insertion takes O(15) = O(1) since each number can be represented with 14 binary bits.
- **Count query using Trie**: Same as insertion, it takes O(1) since we only traverse 15 bits.
- **Loop through nums**: There are `n` elements, and for each element, we perform two queries (high and low) and one insert operation, each taking O(1).
- **Total Time Complexity**: O(n), which is efficient given the constraints.

This solution efficiently finds the number of pairs with the desired XOR properties by using a Trie to store and query binary representations of the numbers.
