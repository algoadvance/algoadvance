title:  Count Number of Rectangles Containing Each Point-out
permalink: /s2250
---

You are given a 2D plane with a list of axis-aligned rectangles and a list of points. Each rectangle is represented as `rectangles[i] = [x, y]` where (x, y) are the coordinates of the top-right corner of the rectangle. Each rectangle has bottom-left corner at (0, 0). Each point is represented as `points[j] = [a, b]` where (a, b) are the coordinates of the point. Your task is to count the number of rectangles that contain each point.

A rectangle with top-right corner (x, y) contains a point (a, b) if and only if `0 <= a <= x` and `0 <= b <= y`.

You need to output an array `result` of length `points`, where `result[j]` is the number of rectangles that contain the `j`-th point.

### Example
```python
rectangles = [[1,2], [2,3], [2,5]]
points = [[2,1], [1,4]]
# Output: [2, 1]
# Explanation:
# - The first point (2,1) is contained in two rectangles [[1,2], [2,3]].
# - The second point (1,4) is contained in only one rectangle [[2,5]].
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the coordinates contain negative values?
2. Is there a limit on the number of rectangles or points?
3. Are the points and rectangles guaranteed to be within the bounds of typical 2D plane dimensions (e.g., non-negative).

### Strategy

1. **Sort Rectangles by Height**: Start by sorting the rectangles based on their height (y-coordinate).
2. **Use Binary Search for Efficient Counting**: For each point, use binary search to quickly find all rectangles that have a height (y-coordinate) greater than or equal to the point's y-coordinate.
3. **Filter by x-coordinate**: After identifying possible rectangles based on the y-coordinate, filter these based on the x-coordinate using binary search again.

- **Sorting Rectangles:** Sort the rectangles by their y-coordinates.
- **Point Query:** For each point, use binary search to find rectangles with y-coordinates >= point's y-coordinate. Then, count how many of these have x-coordinates >= point's x-coordinate.

### Code

```python
from bisect import bisect_left

def count_rectangles(rectangles, points):
    # Sort rectangles by y first, and then by x within same y
    rectangles.sort(key=lambda x: (x[1], x[0]))
    
    # Extract lists for sorted_x and sorted_y separately for binary search
    sorted_x = [rect[0] for rect in rectangles]
    sorted_y = [rect[1] for rect in rectangles]
    
    results = []

    for a, b in points:
        # Find the index where rectangles have y >= b
        index_y = bisect_left(sorted_y, b)
        
        # Now consider rectangles from index_y onwards
        count = 0
        for i in range(index_y, len(rectangles)):
            if sorted_x[i] >= a:
                count += 1
        
        results.append(count)

    return results

# Example Usage
rectangles = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [2, 5]]
points = [[2, 1], [1, 4]]
print(count_rectangles(rectangles, points))  # Output: [2, 1]
```

### Time Complexity

1. Sorting the rectangles based on their y-coordinates: \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of rectangles.
2. For each point, binary search for relevant rectangles and counting: \(O(m \log n)\), where \(m\) is the number of points.

Thus, the overall complexity is \(O(n \log n + m \log n)\), which should be efficient for large inputs.
