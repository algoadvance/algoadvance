title:  Eliminate Maximum Number of Monsters-out

You are playing a game where you have to eliminate monsters as they approach your starting point. You are given a 0-indexed integer array `dist` of the initial distances of the monsters from your starting point and an integer array `speed` of the same length where `dist[i]` represents the initial distance of the i-th monster and `speed[i]` represents the speed of the i-th monster (i.e., the i-th monster will reach your starting point in `dist[i] / speed[i]` minutes).

You can eliminate at most one monster per minute. Return the maximum number of monsters that you can eliminate before any of them reaches your starting point.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the lengths of `dist` and `speed` always the same?**
   - Yes, both arrays have the same length.
   
2. **Is `dist[i]` always positive or zero?**
   - Yes, the distances are always non-negative.
   
3. **Is `speed[i]` always positive?**
   - Yes, the speed will always be a positive value.

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Arrival Times:**
   - Compute the time it takes for each monster to reach the starting point using the formula `dist[i] / speed[i]`.

2. **Sort Arrival Times:**
   - Sort these arrival times in ascending order.

3. **Elimination Simulation:**
   - Keep track of the number of monsters we have eliminated and compare the current time (starting from 0) with the monsters' arrival times.
   - Eliminate a monster each minute sequentially and verify if it can be done before the next monster arrives.
   
By sorting the monsters based on their arrival times, we ensure that we always attempt to eliminate the monster that arrives the earliest.

## Time Complexity

- Calculating the arrival times takes `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the `dist` array.
- Sorting the arrival times takes `O(n log n)`.
- Simulating the elimination process takes `O(n)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.

## Code

```python
def eliminateMaximum(dist, speed):
    # Calculate the time each monster will take to reach the starting point
    arrival_times = [dist[i] / speed[i] for i in range(len(dist))]
    # Sort these times
    arrival_times.sort()
    
    # Initialize the current time we are at
    current_time = 0
    
    # Iterate over the sorted arrival times
    for time in arrival_times:
        if current_time >= time:
            # If the current time is greater than or equal to the arrival time of the monster,
            # then we can't eliminate this monster before it reaches the starting point.
            return current_time
        current_time += 1
    
    # If we managed to eliminate all monsters we return the total count
    return current_time

# Example usage
dist = [1, 3, 4]
speed = [1, 1, 1]
print(eliminateMaximum(dist, speed))  # Output should be 3 since we can eliminate all three monsters

dist = [1, 1, 2, 3]
speed = [1, 1, 1, 1]
print(eliminateMaximum(dist, speed))  # Output should be 1 as all monsters reach at the same time
```

This code will provide the maximum number of monsters that can be eliminated before any of them reaches the starting point, based on the specified distances and speeds.
