title:  Largest Magic Square-out
permalink: /s1895

You are given a `m x n` grid of integers. A square grid is called *magic* if the sum of the integers in each row, each column, and the two diagonals is the same. Return the size (the side length) of the largest magic square that can be found within the given grid.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: grid = [[7,1,4,5,6],
               [2,5,1,6,4],
               [1,5,4,3,2],
               [1,2,7,3,4]]
Output: 3
Explanation: [[5,1,6],
              [5,4,3],
              [2,7,3]] is the largest magic square.
```

**Constraints:**

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 50`
- `1 <= grid[i][j] <= 10^6`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Is it guaranteed that there will be at least one magic square in the grid?
2. What should we return if there is no magic square in the grid?
3. Can the magic square be of size 1x1?
4. Should we only consider squares that are entirely within the bounds of the grid?

For the purpose of this problem, we will assume 1x1 squares are trivially magic, and any square must be fully within the grid.

## Strategy

1. First, note that each element should contribute to the sum for every row, every column, and the two diagonals.
2. We need to scan every possible sub-square in the grid, and for each check if it is magic.
3. To do this efficiently, we can use prefix sums for rows and columns to quickly calculate sums of any sub-array within the grid.
4. We will iterate through possible top-left corners of the squares, and for each possible side length, check if the square is magic by summing rows, columns, and diagonals.

## Code

```python
def largestMagicSquare(grid):
    def is_magic(square_sum, x, y, k):
        # Check rows and columns
        for i in range(k):
            row_sum = sum(grid[x + i][y:y + k])
            col_sum = sum(grid[x + j][y + i] for j in range(k))
            if row_sum != square_sum or col_sum != square_sum:
                return False
        
        # Check diagonals
        diag1 = sum(grid[x + i][y + i] for i in range(k))
        diag2 = sum(grid[x + i][y + k - 1 - i] for i in range(k))
        
        return diag1 == square_sum and diag2 == square_sum

    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    max_k = min(m, n)
    
    for k in range(max_k, 0, -1):
        for i in range(m - k + 1):
            for j in range(n - k + 1):
                square_sum = sum(grid[i][j:j + k])
                if is_magic(square_sum, i, j, k):
                    return k
    
    return 1

# Example usage
grid = [
    [7, 1, 4, 5, 6],
    [2, 5, 1, 6, 4],
    [1, 5, 4, 3, 2],
    [1, 2, 7, 3, 4]
]

print(largestMagicSquare(grid))  # Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initializing prefix sums:** O(m * n)
- **Checking each possible k:** 
  - Inner loops for checking each sub-square start from largest k and shrink to 1
  - Each check involves summing k rows, k columns, and calculating two diagonals

Overall, the solution will be O(m * n * min(m, n) * k), which is manageable within the constraints (1 <= m, n <= 50).
