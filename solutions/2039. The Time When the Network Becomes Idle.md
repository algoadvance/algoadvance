title:  The Time When the Network Becomes Idle-out
permalink: /s2039
---

You are given an undirected graph of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, represented by a 2D integer array `edges`, where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates that there is a bidirectional edge between nodes `ui` and `vi`. The graph is initially connected.

You are also given an array `patience` of length `n` where `patience[i]` indicates the patience of the `i-th` node:

- If the last sent message does not get a response before the `patience[i]` seconds, the node will resend the message.
- Therefore, a node will keep resending its message every `patience[i]` seconds.

You can assume that messages are sent instantaneously, the nodes process them immediately, and because of this, they instantly respond to each other. 

The idle time of a node is the time when it stops resending messages until it gets the response for the last message.

Your task is to return the earliest second when the network becomes idle. This means that all nodes have received their messages and stopped resending them.

### Clarifying Questions

Before we start solving the problem, here are a few clarifying questions:
1. Is the graph guaranteed to be connected or do we have to check for isolated nodes?
2. Is the beacon node always node `0`?
3. Are nodes other than node `0` guaranteed to have non-zero patience values?
4. Should we consider the network as idle as soon as all nodes stop sending messages, or only when the last node stops sending messages?

### Code

Here is the Python solution for the problem:

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

def networkBecomesIdle(edges, patience):
    n = len(patience)
    
    # Build the graph
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        graph[v].append(u)
    
    # BFS to calculate shortest path from node 0 to all other nodes
    dist = [-1] * n
    dist[0] = 0 # distance to itself is zero
    q = deque([0])
    
    while q:
        current = q.popleft()
        current_dist = dist[current]
        
        for neighbor in graph[current]:
            if dist[neighbor] == -1:
                dist[neighbor] = current_dist + 1
                q.append(neighbor)
    
    # Calculate the earliest time when the network becomes idle
    max_time = 0
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        d = dist[i]
        last_message_time = ((2*d - 1) // patience[i]) * patience[i] # latest resend time where response would not have returned
        last_response_time = last_message_time + 2 * d # time for the last sent message to get back with a response
        max_time = max(max_time, last_response_time)
    
    # +1 to account for the second when the network just becomes idle
    return max_time + 1
```

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation**: Transform the edge list into an adjacency list to represent the graph.
2. **BFS for Shortest Path Calculation**: Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) from node 0 to compute the shortest path distance from node 0 to all other nodes. This gives us the round trip time for messages.
3. **Resending Logic**: Each node `i` sends its message initially and then resends it every `patience[i]` seconds if it doesn't get a response back. Compute the time when the node will receive the last response considering the resending logic.
4. **Earliest Idle Time Calculation**: Track the maximum of these last response times adjusted with their patience intervals to find when the network becomes fully idle.
5. **Time Complexity**: The BFS traversal takes O(n + m) where `n` is the number of nodes and `m` is the number of edges. The final iteration over all nodes takes O(n). So, the overall time complexity is O(n + m).

### Time Complexity

- **Graph Construction**: O(n + m), where `n` is the number of nodes and `m` is the number of edges.
- **BFS Traversal**: O(n + m), to find the shortest paths from the beacon node.
- **Idle Time Calculation**: O(n), for iterating through each node to calculate the idle time.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n + m)**. 

This ensures that the solution is efficient for most practical sizes of `n` and `m` as given in typical problem constraints.
