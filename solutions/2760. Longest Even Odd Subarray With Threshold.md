title:  Longest Even Odd Subarray With Threshold-out
permalink: /s2760
---

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `threshold`, the task is to find the length of the longest subarray that meets the following criteria:
- The subarray is an even-odd sequence, where each adjacent pair of elements alternates between even and odd.
- Each element in the subarray is less than or equal to the `threshold`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the expected inputs?**
   - The input `nums` is a list of integers.
   - The input `threshold` is a single integer.

2. **What should be returned?**
   - The length of the longest subarray that fulfills the given criteria.

3. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - It depends on the specific problem constraints, but typically arrays can contain negative values unless otherwise stated.

4. **What if multiple subarrays have the same length?**
   - We only need to return the length, so it doesn't matter if there are multiple subarrays of the same maximum length.

5. **Is the array guaranteed to contain at least one element?**
   - This will be assumed unless specified otherwise in the problem.

6. **Can the threshold be negative?**
   - Typically, in problems like this, the threshold is non-negative, but both positive and negative numbers below the threshold should be considered.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Use two pointers to track the start and end of the current valid subarray.
   - Keep a variable to store the length of the longest valid subarray found.

2. **Iterate over the Array:**
   - Check each element and its adjacent element to ensure they're alternating and below the threshold.
   - Maintain a running count of the current valid subarray length.
   - Update the maximum length whenever a longer valid subarray is found.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Handle empty arrays by returning 0.
   - Handle arrays where none or only some elements meet the criteria.
   
### Code

```python
def longest_even_odd_subarray(nums, threshold):
    max_length = 0
    current_length = 0
    n = len(nums)
    
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        if nums[i] > threshold:
            current_length = 0
            continue
        
        if i == 0 or (nums[i] <= threshold and nums[i-1] <= threshold and 
                      ((nums[i] % 2 == 0 and nums[i-1] % 2 != 0) or (nums[i] % 2 != 0 and nums[i-1] % 2 == 0))):
            current_length += 1
        else:
            current_length = 1
        
        max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
    
    return max_length

# Example usage:
nums = [3, 2, 5, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]
threshold = 5
print(longest_even_odd_subarray(nums, threshold))  # Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of elements in the array. This is because we are making a single pass through the array to determine the longest valid subarray length.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is `O(1)` because we only use a few extra variables for tracking lengths and pointers, independent of the input size.
