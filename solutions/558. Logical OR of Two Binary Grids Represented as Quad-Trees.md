title:  Logical OR of Two Binary Grids Represented as Quad-Trees-out
permalink: /s558
---

We are given two binary trees `quadTree1` and `quadTree2`. These binary trees represent two binary grids in a compressed form using quad-trees. Each leaf node in a quad-tree represents a grid cell that can either be `False` (0) or `True` (1). The non-leaf nodes represent the subdivision of the grid into four quadrants.

Each node in the quad-tree has either four children or is a leaf node. The structure of a node in the quad-tree is defined as follows:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, isLeaf, topLeft, topRight, bottomLeft, bottomRight):
        self.val = val
        self.isLeaf = isLeaf
        self.topLeft = topLeft
        self.topRight = topRight
        self.bottomLeft = bottomLeft
        self.bottomRight = bottomRight
```

The task is to compute the logical OR of these two input binary grids, where the logical OR merges two grids into a bigger grid, setting each cell `(i, j)` to `1` if any cell `(i, j)` in either of the grids is `1`.

The function should return the resulting quad-tree which represents the logical OR of both input grids.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format**: 
   - Are `quadTree1` and `quadTree2` guaranteed to be valid quad-trees?
   - Can either of the input quad-trees be empty?

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - How to handle when both `quadTree1` and `quadTree2` are leaves?
   - Will both trees always have the same size or depth? 

3. **Output Format**:
   - Should the output be a quad-tree of the same class `Node`?

Assuming standard input outputs based on quad-trees structure:

### Strategy

1. **Leaf Node Evaluation**:
   - If both nodes are leaves, the result is a leaf node whose value is the logical OR of the two given node values.

2. **Merge Cases**:
   - If one node is a leaf and the other is not, we need to recursively apply the OR operation for the non-leaf node.
   - If neither node is a leaf, we recursively apply the OR operation to each quadrant.

3. **Optimization**:
   - If after merging, all four children of a node are leaves with the same value, we can merge them into a single leaf node to keep the structure efficient.

### Code Implementation

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, isLeaf, topLeft=None, topRight=None, bottomLeft=None, bottomRight=None):
        self.val = val
        self.isLeaf = isLeaf
        self.topLeft = topLeft
        self.topRight = topRight
        self.bottomLeft = bottomLeft
        self.bottomRight = bottomRight

def intersect(quadTree1: Node, quadTree2: Node) -> Node:
    if quadTree1.isLeaf:
        if quadTree1.val:
            return Node(True, True)
        else:
            return quadTree2
    if quadTree2.isLeaf:
        if quadTree2.val:
            return Node(True, True)
        else:
            return quadTree1
    
    topLeft = intersect(quadTree1.topLeft, quadTree2.topLeft)
    topRight = intersect(quadTree1.topRight, quadTree2.topRight)
    bottomLeft = intersect(quadTree1.bottomLeft, quadTree2.bottomLeft)
    bottomRight = intersect(quadTree1.bottomRight, quadTree2.bottomRight)
    
    if topLeft.isLeaf and topRight.isLeaf and bottomLeft.isLeaf and bottomRight.isLeaf:
        if topLeft.val == topRight.val == bottomLeft.val == bottomRight.val:
            return Node(topLeft.val, True)
    
    return Node(False, False, topLeft, topRight, bottomLeft, bottomRight)
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity can be represented as \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the quad-tree.
- Each merge and check operation is constant time for each set of children.

This should provide a clear, concise solution to determine the logical OR of two quad-tree based binary grids.
