title:  Counting Bits-out
permalink: /s338
---
Given an integer `n`, return an array `ans` of length `n + 1` such that for each `i` (0 <= i <= n), `ans[i]` is the number of `1`'s in the binary representation of `i`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What should be the format of the output?
   - The function should return a list of integers.
2. Are there any constraints on the value of `n`?
   - Yes, `0 <= n <= 10^5`, as per common constraint limits for LeetCode problems.
3. Is there any specific requirement for the method to calculate the number of `1`s?
   - The method should be efficient, preferably better than O(n log n), which is the time complexity of counting bits individually for each number.

### Strategy
One efficient way to solve this problem is by using dynamic programming and the properties of binary numbers:

1. **Binary Observations**:
   - The number of `1`s in a binary number can be built from the number of `1`s in smaller numbers.
   - For a number `i` in binary: if `i` is an even number, the number of `1`s in `i` is the same as the number of `1`s in `i // 2` (shifting right by 1 bit).
   - If `i` is an odd number, it has one more `1` than `i - 1`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Use an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the count of `1`s in the binary representation of `i`.
   - Initialize `dp[0]` to 0 because the number `0` has no `1`s.
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n`, calculate `dp[i]` based on whether `i` is even or odd as explained above.

### Code
```python
def countBits(n: int) -> [int]:
    # Initialize the array to store number of 1's for each integer
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Start from 1 and calculate number of 1's using previous numbers
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i] = dp[i >> 1] + (i & 1)
    
    return dp
```

### Explanation
- `dp` is initialized with `n+1` zeros since we need counts from `0` to `n`.
- The loop runs from `1` to `n`.
  - `i >> 1` is the integer division of `i` by `2`, effectively shifting the bits to the right.
  - `i & 1` checks if the least significant bit of `i` is `1` (i.e., whether `i` is odd).
  - `dp[i]` is calculated as the count of `1`s in `i >> 1` plus `i & 1`.
- Return the array `dp` which contains the result.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is **O(n)** since we are iterating through each number from `0` to `n` once.
- The space complexity is also **O(n)** because we are storing the counts in a list of size `n + 1`.
