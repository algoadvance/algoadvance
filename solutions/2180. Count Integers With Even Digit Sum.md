title:  Count Integers With Even Digit Sum-out
permalink: /s2180
---

You are given a positive integer `num`. Return the number of positive integers less than or equal to `num` whose digit sums are even.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Is `num` always a positive integer?
     - Yes, `num` is always positive.

2. **Range of `num`**:
   - What is the range of `num`?
     - Typically, `num` can be any positive integer up to large values, but let's focus on standard constraints where `num` could be up to \(10^9\).

3. **Output**:
   - Do we return the count of numbers whose digit sums are even?
     - Yes, return the count of numbers whose digit sums are even.

### Code

```python
def countEven(num: int) -> int:
    def is_even_digit_sum(n):
        return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n)) % 2 == 0
    
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, num + 1):
        if is_even_digit_sum(i):
            count += 1
            
    return count

# Example Usage
num = 30
print(countEven(num))  # Output should be the count of numbers <= 30 with even digit sums
```

### Strategy

1. **Digit Sum Calculation**:
   - Convert each number to a string to easily iterate over its digits.
   - Sum the digits and check if the sum is even.

2. **Iteration**:
   - Iterate through all numbers from 1 to `num`.
   - Use a helper function `is_even_digit_sum` to determine if the number's digit sum is even.

3. **Counting**:
   - Maintain a counter to count how many numbers have even digit sums.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N \times d)\), where \(N\) is the value of `num` and \(d\) is the number of digits in each number (approximately \(\log_{10}(num)\)).
  - We iterate through all numbers from 1 to `num` (O(N)).
  - For each number, we sum its digits, which takes \(O(d)\).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), aside from the input and a few counters and variables, we use constant extra space.

This approach is straightforward and sufficient for reasonably sized `num`. For larger values closer to \(10^9\), further optimizations or mathematical insights may be necessary to manage efficiency.
