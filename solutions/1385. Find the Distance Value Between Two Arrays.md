title:  Find the Distance Value Between Two Arrays-out
permalink: /s1385
---

You are given two integer arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, and an integer `d`.

The **distance value** is defined as the number of elements `arr1[i]` such that there is not any element `arr2[j]` where `|arr1[i] - arr2[j]| <= d`.

```python
Example 1:
Input: arr1 = [4,5,8], arr2 = [10,9,1,8], d = 2
Output: 2

Example 2:
Input: arr1 = [1,4,2,3], arr2 = [-4,-3,6,10,20,30], d = 3
Output: 2

Example 3:
Input: arr1 = [2,1,100,3], arr2 = [-5,-2,10,-3,7], d = 6
Output: 1
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the input sizes?**
   - The arrays `arr1` and `arr2` each have lengths between 1 and 500.
   - The elements in both arrays and `d` are all integers between -10000 and 10000.

2. **Do we need to handle inputs where arr1 or arr2 might be empty?**
   - No, per constraints, `arr1` and `arr2` will always be non-empty.

3. **What should the function return?**
   - The function should return the "distance value" as defined above.

### Strategy

- The simplest approach is to use brute force, where for each element in `arr1`, we check all elements in `arr2` to see if the condition `|arr1[i] - arr2[j]| <= d` is violated.
- A more optimized approach could involve sorting `arr2` and using binary search to find if there's any element within the range `[arr1[i] - d, arr1[i] + d]`.

We'll start with the brute force approach for simplicity.

### Code

```python
from bisect import bisect_left, bisect_right

def findTheDistanceValue(arr1, arr2, d):
    arr2.sort()  # Sort arr2 to apply binary search
    distance_value = 0
    
    for num in arr1:
        # Find the position where the current number should fit in sorted arr2
        left = bisect_left(arr2, num - d)
        right = bisect_right(arr2, num + d)
        
        # If no element in arr2 is within the range
        if left == right:
            distance_value += 1
    
    return distance_value

# Example runs
print(findTheDistanceValue([4,5,8], [10,9,1,8], 2))  # Output: 2
print(findTheDistanceValue([1,4,2,3], [-4,-3,6,10,20,30], 3))  # Output: 2
print(findTheDistanceValue([2,1,100,3], [-5,-2,10,-3,7], 6))  # Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity

- Sorting `arr2` takes `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the length of `arr2`.
- For each element in `arr1`, we perform a binary search which is `O(log n)`.
- Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(m log n)`, where `m` is the length of `arr1` and `n` is the length of `arr2`.

This approach ensures efficient computation even when the input sizes are at their upper limits.
