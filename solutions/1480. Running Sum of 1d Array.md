title:  Running Sum of 1d Array-out
permalink: /s1480
---

You're given an array of numbers called `nums`. You need to return an array that consists of the running sums of the `nums` array.

The running sum at position `i` is the sum of all elements from the start of the array up to the `i-th` element.

For example, if the array `nums` is `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, the running sum array would be `[1, 3, 6, 10]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of the length of `nums`?
   - What are the possible values of the elements in `nums`? Are they all integers?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What if `nums` is an empty array? Should we return an empty array as well?
   - Is `nums` always guaranteed to have at least one element?

3. **Output:**
   - Is it acceptable to modify the input array `nums` in-place, or should a new array be returned?

### Strategy

1. **Initialize a Result Array:**
   - Start with an empty result array.

2. **Iterate through the Input Array:**
   - Maintain a running sum that starts at 0.
   - For each element in the array, add it to the running sum and append the running sum to the result array.

3. **Return the Result Array:**
   - After the loop completes, the result array should contain the running sums.

### Code

```python
def runningSum(nums):
    result = []
    running_sum = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        running_sum += num
        result.append(running_sum)
        
    return result
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because we are iterating through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\), since we are creating a new result array of the same length as `nums`.

### Example

```python
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(runningSum(nums))  # Output: [1, 3, 6, 10]

nums = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1]
print(runningSum(nums))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

nums = [3, 1, 2, 10, 1]
print(runningSum(nums))  # Output: [3, 4, 6, 16, 17]
```

In these examples, the function `runningSum` correctly computes the running sums and returns the expected arrays.
