title:  Sort Integers by The Number of 1 Bits-out
permalink: /s1356
---

Given an integer array `arr`, you need to sort the array in a specific order:
1. First, sort the integers by the number of 1 bits in their binary representation (in ascending order).
2. If two integers have the same number of 1 bits, sort them by their decimal value (in ascending order).

Return the sorted array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Origin**: Should we assume that the input array is taken directly from the user, or will it always be passed as a function argument?
    - **Assumption**: The input is passed as a function argument.
    
2. **Range of Values**: Are there any constraints on the size of the array or the range of integer values?
    - **Assumption**: Follow general leetcode constraints which usually involve reasonable limits for programming contests (e.g., `1 <= arr.length <= 500` and `0 <= arr[i] <= 10^4`).

3. **Output**: Is the output supposed to be returned or printed?
    - **Assumption**: The output should be returned.

### Strategy

1. **Counting 1 Bits**: Use Pythonâ€™s in-built functions to convert an integer to its binary representation and count the number of `1` bits. For example, `bin(x).count('1')`.
2. **Sorting**: Use Python's `sorted()` function with a custom key that first sorts by the number of 1 bits and then by the integer value itself.

### Time Complexity

1. **Counting 1 Bits**: The binary representation of an integer up to `10^4` can have at most 14 bits. Counting the bits is `O(1)` for each number.
2. **Sorting**: Sorting an array of length `n` is `O(n log n)`.

The overall time complexity will be dominated by the sorting step: **O(n log n)**.

### Code

```python
def sortByBits(arr):
    # Define the custom sorting key
    def sort_key(x):
        return (bin(x).count('1'), x)
    
    # Return the sorted array
    return sorted(arr, key=sort_key)

# Example usage
arr = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
sorted_array = sortByBits(arr)
print(sorted_array)  # Output: [0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 3, 5, 6, 7]
```

This code correctly implements the strategy and efficiently sorts the array based on the provided rules.
