Given a non-negative integer `x`, compute and return the square root of `x`.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only the integer part of the result is returned.

**Example 1:**
```plaintext
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**
```plaintext
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

### Clarifying Questions
Before we start, letâ€™s clarify a few things:
1. **What is the range of `x`?** 
   - The problem doesn't state explicitly, but typically, `0 <= x <= 2^31 - 1` (which is the range of a non-negative 32-bit integer).
2. **What should be the return type?**
   - The return type should be an integer.
3. **Is there any specific time complexity constraint?**
   - We should aim for an efficient solution, ideally with a time complexity better than O(x).

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use binary search since it provides an efficient way to find the square root in a log-scale time complexity. Binary search helps us reduce the potential range of square roots at each step by half.

#### Steps:
1. Initialize `left` to 0 and `right` to `x`.
2. While `left` is less than or equal to `right`:
   - Compute `mid` as `(left + right) // 2`.
   - Compute `mid_squared` as `mid * mid`.
   - If `mid_squared` equals `x`, return `mid`.
   - If `mid_squared` is less than `x`, set `left` to `mid + 1` (since we need a larger number).
   - If `mid_squared` is greater than `x`, set `right` to `mid - 1` (since we need a smaller number).
3. If no exact square root is found (i.e., `mid_squared` never equals `x`), `right` will be the floor of the square root when the loop terminates.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(log x), as each iteration of the binary search reduces the search space by half.

### Code
Here's a Python implementation of the above strategy:

```python
def mySqrt(x: int) -> int:
    if x < 2:
        return x

    left, right = 0, x

    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        mid_squared = mid * mid

        if mid_squared == x:
            return mid
        elif mid_squared < x:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1

    return right
```

### Explanation
1. **Base Case:** If `x` is less than 2, return `x`. This covers the edge cases for 0 and 1.
2. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - Calculate `mid` and `mid_squared`.
   - Adjust `left` and `right` based on the comparison between `mid_squared` and `x`.
   - If `mid_squared` matches `x`, return `mid`.
   - Continue until `left` exceeds `right`.
3. **Return the Floor Value:** When the loop terminates without finding an exact match, `right` will hold the largest integer whose square is less than or equal to `x`.

This solution efficiently computes the integer square root by leveraging binary search and runs in logarithmic time relative to the input size.
