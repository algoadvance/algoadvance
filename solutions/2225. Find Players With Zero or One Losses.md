title:  Find Players With Zero or One Losses-out
permalink: /s2225
---

You are given an integer array `matches` where `matches[i] = [winner_i, loser_i]` indicates that the player `winner_i` defeated player `loser_i` in a match. 

You have to return a list `answer` of size 2 where:
- `answer[0]` is a list of all players who have not lost any matches.
- `answer[1]` is a list of all players who have lost exactly one match.

The lists in the `answer` should be in increasing order.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Are the player IDs unique?**
   - Yes, each player ID is unique.

2. **What is the range of player IDs and the total number of matches?**
   - Typically, this information isn't provided which means the solution should be designed to handle general cases efficiently.

3. **Can there be players who never played a match?**
   - Yes, there could be players who never appeared in any match as either winners or losers.

4. **Do we need to handle invalid inputs?**
   - For this problem, assume all inputs are valid.

### Strategy:

1. **Counting Wins and Losses:**
   * Use dictionaries to count the number of losses for each player.
   * Use a set to keep track of players who have participated in any matches.

2. **Populate the Dictionaries:**
   * Iterate through the `matches` list and update the losses count for the losers.
   * Add both winners and losers to the set of players.

3. **Classify Players:**
   * Iterate through the set of players, and classify them based on their losses:
     * Players with zero losses.
     * Players with exactly one loss.

4. **Sort the Results:**
   * Sort the lists as required and return them as the output.

### Code:

```python
def findWinners(matches):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Dictionary to count the number of losses for each player
    loss_count = defaultdict(int)
    players = set()
    
    # Update the loss_count and players set from matches
    for winner, loser in matches:
        loss_count[loser] += 1
        players.add(winner)
        players.add(loser)
    
    # Result lists
    zero_losses = []
    one_loss = []
    
    # Classify players based on their loss count
    for player in players:
        if loss_count[player] == 0:
            zero_losses.append(player)
        elif loss_count[player] == 1:
            one_loss.append(player)
    
    # Sorting the results
    zero_losses.sort()
    one_loss.sort()
    
    return [zero_losses, one_loss]

# Example usage
matches = [[1,3],[2,3],[3,6],[5,6],[5,7],[4,5],[4,8],[4,9],[10,4],[10,9]]
print(findWinners(matches))  # Output: [[1, 2, 10], [4, 5, 7, 8]]
```

### Time Complexity:

1. **Counting Losses and Collecting Players:**
   * Iterating over the `matches` list takes O(n).

2. **Classifying and Sorting Players:**
   * Iterating over the set of players takes O(p) where p is the number of players.
   * Sorting the lists takes O(p log p).

Thus, the overall time complexity of this solution is O(n + p log p), where n is the number of matches and p is the number of distinct players.
