title:  Valid Arrangement of Pairs-out
permalink: /s2097
---

You are given a 2D integer array `pairs` where `pairs[i] = [start_i, end_i]` denotes a pair of integers. Your task is to determine if there exists a valid arrangement of these pairs such that for every pair `[a, b]` in the arrangement (except the last pair), `b` is the start of the next pair in the order.

Return the valid arrangement of pairs if it exists, and any such arrangement is acceptable. If no such arrangement exists, return an empty array.

Example:
```python
Input: pairs = [[5,1],[4,5],[11,9],[9,4]]
Output: [[11,9],[9,4],[4,5],[5,1]]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the pairs guaranteed to form a valid path?**
   - No, it's possible that the pairs do not form a valid path, in which case we should return an empty array.
2. **Can there be duplicate pairs?**
   - The problem does not explicitly mention it, but we assume pairs could be unique for simplicity unless stated otherwise.

## Strategy

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - Create a directed graph where each pair `[a, b]` corresponds to a directed edge from `a` to `b`.

2. **Degree Calculation**:
   - Calculate the in-degree and out-degree of each node.

3. **Finding the Starting Node**:
   - The starting node will have an out-degree that exceeds its in-degree by 1. If all degrees balance perfectly, any vertex with an outgoing edge can be the start.

4. **Eulerian Path**:
   - Use Hierholzer’s algorithm to find the Eulerian path in the graph. This path will visit every edge exactly once.

## Time Complexity

- **Graph Construction and Degree Calculation**: O(n), where n is the number of pairs.
- **Hierholzer's Algorithm for Eulerian Path**: O(E), where E is the number of edges.

Overall, since each pair is an edge, the time complexity is O(n).

## Code

Here’s how you can implement the solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def validArrangement(pairs):
    def find_eulerian_path():
        stack = [start_node]
        path = []
        while stack:
            node = stack[-1]
            if graph[node]:
                next_node = graph[node].pop()
                stack.append(next_node)
            else:
                path.append(stack.pop())
        return path[::-1]

    graph = defaultdict(list)
    in_degree = defaultdict(int)
    out_degree = defaultdict(int)

    # Build the graph and calculate in-degrees and out-degrees
    for start, end in pairs:
        graph[start].append(end)
        out_degree[start] += 1
        in_degree[end] += 1

    # Find the start node for Eulerian Path
    start_node = pairs[0][0]
    for node in out_degree:
        if out_degree[node] - in_degree[node] == 1:
            start_node = node
            break

    # Get Eulerian Path
    eulerian_path = find_eulerian_path()
    
    # Convert path into pairs
    valid_pairs = [[eulerian_path[i], eulerian_path[i + 1]] for i in range(len(eulerian_path) - 1)]
    
    return valid_pairs

# Example usage
pairs = [[5,1], [4,5], [11,9], [9,4]]
print(validArrangement(pairs))  # Output: [[11,9],[9,4],[4,5],[5,1]]
```

This code sets up a graph from the input pairs and uses Hierholzer's Algorithm to efficiently find an Eulerian path, giving the required valid arrangement of pairs if it exists.
