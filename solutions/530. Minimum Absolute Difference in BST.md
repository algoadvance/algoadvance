title:  Minimum Absolute Difference in BST-out
permalink: /s530
---

Given a Binary Search Tree (BST), you need to find the minimum absolute difference between values of any two nodes in the BST.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Type:**
   - Can the BST contain duplicate values? *(Typically, a BST should not contain duplicate values.)*
   - How large can the tree be? *(This helps to consider time and space complexity constraints.)*

2. **Output Type:**
   - Should we return the minimum absolute difference as an integer?

### Strategy:

To find the minimum absolute difference in a BST:
1. **Inorder Traversal:** Utilize the properties of BST where an inorder traversal yields nodes in sorted order. This helps in evaluating the difference between subsequent elements easily.
2. **Calculate Min Difference:** As we traverse, keep track of the previous node value and compute the difference with the current node value. Track the minimum of these differences.

### Code:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def getMinimumDifference(root: TreeNode) -> int:
    def inorder_traversal(node):
        nonlocal prev, min_diff
        if not node:
            return
        inorder_traversal(node.left)
        if prev is not None:
            min_diff = min(min_diff, node.val - prev)
        prev = node.val
        inorder_traversal(node.right)
    
    prev = None
    min_diff = float('inf')
    inorder_traversal(root)
    return min_diff
```

### Strategy Explanation:

1. **Inorder Traversal:**
   - Traverse the left subtree.
   - Process the current node.
   - Traverse the right subtree.
   - This ensures that the nodes are processed in ascending order of their values, due to the properties of the BST.

2. **Tracking Minimum Difference:**
   - Maintain a `prev` variable to store the value of the previously visited node.
   - Compute the difference between the current nodeâ€™s value and `prev`.
   - Update `min_diff` if the computed difference is smaller than the current `min_diff`.

3. **Initialization:**
   - Start with `prev` as `None`.
   - Set `min_diff` to a large value (`float('inf')`), to ensure any actual difference found will be smaller.

4. **Recursive Function:**
   - The `inorder_traversal` function is called recursively, ensuring the entire tree is traversed and compared.

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes in the BST, as each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(h)` where `h` is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (unbalanced tree), this could be `O(n)`. In the average case (balanced tree), this is `O(log n)`.

This approach ensures an efficient and straightforward way to compute the minimum absolute difference in a BST.
