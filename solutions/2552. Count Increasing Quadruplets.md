title:  Count Increasing Quadruplets-out
permalink: /s2552
---

Given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` of size `n` containing all distinct integers from `1` to `n`, return the number of increasing quadruplets `(i, j, k, l)` such that `i < j < k < l` and `nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j] < nums[l]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the array size `n`?**
   - Typically, `n` can be up to `10^4` or more in competitive programming settings.

2. **Are there any specific constraints on the values within the array?**
   - Yes, the array consists of distinct integers from `1` to `n`.

3. **Should the quadruplets be strictly increasing in indices order?**
   - Yes, the quadruplets should satisfy `i < j < k < l`.

4. **Is it necessary to return only the count of such quadruplets?**
   - Yes, just the count is expected.

### Strategy

First, let's summarize the problem requirements:
- We need to find four indices `(i, j, k, l)` such that 
  - `i < j < k < l`
  - `nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j] < nums[l]`

A brute-force approach would involve iterating over every possible combination of four different indices and checking the conditions. However, this would have a time complexity of \(O(n^4)\), which is not efficient for large values of `n`.

To improve efficiency, we can make use of precomputing and cumulative counts of possible elements fitting the required conditions, involving three main steps:
1. Precompute prefix counts for each element, indicating how many smaller elements exist before it.
2. Use these counts effectively to check possible combinations of quadruplets while iterating the array.

### Code

```python
def countIncreasingQuadruplets(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    count = 0

    # Precompute smaller counts
    smaller = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

    for j in range(1, n):
        for i in range(j):
            if nums[i] < nums[j]:
                smaller[j][i] = smaller[j][i - 1] + 1
            else:
                smaller[j][i] = smaller[j][i - 1]

    # Precompute larger counts
    larger = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

    for k in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        for l in range(n - 1, k, -1):
            if nums[l] > nums[k]:
                larger[k][l] = larger[k + 1][l] + 1
            else:
                larger[k][l] = larger[k + 1][l]

    # Calculate quadruplet counts
    for j in range(n - 2):
        for k in range(j + 1, n - 1):
            if nums[j] < nums[k]:
                count += smaller[j][j - 1] * larger[k][k + 1]

    return count
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is derived as follows:
1. **Smaller counts precomputation:** \(O(n^2)\)
2. **Larger counts precomputation:** \(O(n^2)\)
3. **Quadruplet count calculation:** \(O(n^2)\)

Overall, the time complexity of the solution is \(O(n^2)\). This is efficient compared to the \(O(n^4)\) brute-force approach and should be reasonable for \(n\) up to \(10^4\).

### Summary

We precompute the counts of smaller and larger elements for each potential quadruplet and then use these precomputed values to efficiently count the valid increasing quadruplets. This reduces the time complexity to \(O(n^2)\) and makes the solution feasible for larger input sizes.
