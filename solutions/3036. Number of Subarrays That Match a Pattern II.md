title:  Number of Subarrays That Match a Pattern II-out
permalink: /s3036
---

Given two 0-indexed integer arrays `arr` and `pattern`, determine the number of contiguous subarrays in `arr` that match the pattern.

A subarray `sub` matches the pattern if sub satisfies the following conditions:
1. The length of sub and pattern are the same.
2. For every i, `sub[i] <-> pattern[i]` (equivalent to having the same relative ordering).

E.g., pattern `[1, 3, 2]` can match:
- `[2, 5, 4]` (since 2 < 5 > 4)
- `[1, 3, 2]`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Relative Ordering:** Need to verify that the relative ordering refers to the less-than, equal-to, or greater-than relationships between the elements.
2. **Integers Range:** What is the range or constraint of integers in the arrays?
3. **Array Length:** Are there constraints on the lengths of the arrays `arr` and `pattern`?

## Strategy

1. **Extract Length:** Determine the length of the pattern `k`.
2. **Loop through `arr`:** Slide over `arr` with a window of size `k`.
3. **Comparison Function:** For each window, compare the relative ordering of elements.
4. **Count Matches:** Increment a counter each time a window matches the pattern.

## Code

```python
def numberOfSubarraysMatchPattern(arr, pattern):
    def match(sub, pattern):
        for i in range(len(sub)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(sub)):
                if (sub[i] < sub[j] and pattern[i] >= pattern[j]) or (sub[i] > sub[j] and pattern[i] <= pattern[j]) or (sub[i] == sub[j] and pattern[i] != pattern[j]):
                    return False
        return True

    n = len(arr)
    k = len(pattern)
    count = 0

    for i in range(n - k + 1):
        if match(arr[i:i + k], pattern):
            count += 1

    return count

# Example Usage
arr = [2, 5, 4, 1, 3, 2]
pattern = [1, 3, 2]
print(numberOfSubarraysMatchPattern(arr, pattern))  # Output: 2
```

## Time Complexity

- **Inner Comparison Function:** The nested loops iterate through the sub and pattern, so time complexity is O(k^2).
- **Sliding Window:** We slide a window of size `k` over `arr` of size `n`, which takes O(n-k+1) iterations.

Combo: The overall time complexity = O((n - k + 1) * k^2) = O(nk^2).

This solution aims to check each subarray relative ordering to match the pattern, which can be optimized if needed but is sufficient given standard constraints.
