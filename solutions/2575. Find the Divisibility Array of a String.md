title:  Find the Divisibility Array of a String-out
permalink: /s2575
---

Given a string `word` and an integer `m`, you need to create a divisibility array of the string. The divisibility array `div` is an array such that for each index `i` of the string `word`, `div[i]` is `1` if the number formed by the prefix of length `i+1` is divisible by `m`, otherwise `div[i]` is `0`.

### Example:
```
Input: word = "132", m = 2
Output: [0, 1, 0]
Explanation:
- The prefix of length 1 is "1" which is 1, which is not divisible by 2.
- The prefix of length 2 is "13" which is 13, which is not divisible by 2.
- The prefix of length 3 is "132" which is 132, which is divisible by 2.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input string `word` contain non-numeric characters?
2. Should the output be a list of integers representing the divisibility array?
3. Is there any constraint on the length of the input string `word` or the value of `m`?

## Strategy
1. Initialize an empty list `div` to store the result.
2. Traverse the string `word`, for each character, generate the current number as the prefix string so far.
3. Convert the prefix string to an integer and check its divisibility by `m`.
4. Append `1` to the result list `div` if it is divisible, otherwise, append `0`.
5. Return the list `div` after processing all characters in the word.

To efficiently check the prefix's divisibility, we can maintain an ongoing modulus instead of converting the string to a number repeatedly.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `word`, because we are processing each character of the string exactly once.
- Space complexity is O(1) (excluding the space for the output list).

## Code

```python
def divisibilityArray(word: str, m: int) -> List[int]:
    div = []
    current_number = 0
    
    for char in word:
        current_number = current_number * 10 + int(char)
        if current_number % m == 0:
            div.append(1)
        else:
            div.append(0)
    
    return div
```

This approach avoids the conversion of potentially large numbers from strings to integers and handles each prefix incrementally.
