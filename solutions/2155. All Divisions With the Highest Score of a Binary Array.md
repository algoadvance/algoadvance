title:  All Divisions With the Highest Score of a Binary Array-out
permalink: /s2155
---

You are given a binary array `nums` (an array consisting of only `0`s and `1`s). We can split `nums` into two arrays (possibly empty) `left` and `right` at any index `i` (where `0 <= i <= len(nums)`). `left` will be the subarray from the start of the array to `i - 1`, and `right` will be the subarray from `i` to the end of the array. After splitting the array, the score of a division is defined as:

- The number of `0`s in the `left` subarray + The number of `1`s in the `right` subarray.

Return all the indices that would maximize the division's score. You may return the answer in any order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there constraints on the size of the input array?**
   - Typically, constraints would be supplied in a detailed problem description. For this exercise, assume a reasonable length for coding interview purposes.

2. **Can the input array be empty?**
   - No, as per standard problem formulation, assume the array has at least one element.

3. **Is the array guaranteed to contain at least one `0` and one `1`?**
   - Assume the array can have any distribution of `0`s and `1`s.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - We need to maintain count variables for the number of `0`s encountered so far and the number of `1`s remaining in the right subarray.

2. **Initial Count Calculation:**
   - Start by calculating the total number of `1`s in the entire array.

3. **Traverse the Array:**
   - As you iterate through the array, adjust the counts of `0`s in the left subarray and `1`s in the right subarray.
   - Calculate the score at each index and keep track of the maximum score.

4. **Store Indices with Maximum Score:**
   - Use a list to store indices where the score is the maximum encountered.

### Time Complexity

- The solution involves two linear passes through the array, giving an overall time complexity of \(O(n)\).

### Code

```python
def maxScoreIndices(nums):
    # Calculate the total number of 1's in the entire array
    total_ones = sum(nums)
    
    max_score = 0
    left_zeros = 0
    right_ones = total_ones
    max_indices = []
    
    for i in range(len(nums) + 1):
        # Calculate the current score
        current_score = left_zeros + right_ones
        if current_score > max_score:
            max_score = current_score
            max_indices = [i]
        elif current_score == max_score:
            max_indices.append(i)
        
        # If not at the end of the list, update left_zeros and right_ones
        if i < len(nums):
            if nums[i] == 0:
                left_zeros += 1
            else:
                right_ones -= 1
    
    return max_indices
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization:**
   - Calculate the total number of `1`s (`total_ones`) in the entire array.
   - Initialize `max_score` to 0, `left_zeros` to 0, and `right_ones` to `total_ones`.
   - `max_indices` will store indices where the maximum score is found.

2. **Iteration:**
   - Loop through each index from `0` to `len(nums)`:
     - Calculate the score as the sum of `left_zeros` and `right_ones`.
     - Compare the `current_score` with `max_score` and update `max_score` and `max_indices` accordingly.
   - Update the counts of `left_zeros` and `right_ones` based on the current element of `nums`.

3. **Return Result:**
   - After the loop, `max_indices` contains all indices with the optimal score, which is returned.

This solution ensures we efficiently find the indices that yield the highest score with a linear scan of the array.
