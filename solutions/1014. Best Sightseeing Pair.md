title:  Best Sightseeing Pair-out
permalink: /s1014

You are given an integer array `values` where `values[i]` represents the value of the i-th sightseeing spot. Two sightseeing spots `i` and `j` have a score defined as `values[i] + values[j] + i - j` (where `i < j`). Return the maximum score of a pair of sightseeing spots.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the expected input size?**
   - The length of the array is up to 50,000.
2. **Can the values in the array be negative?**
   - Yes, values can be negative.
3. **Is there always a valid pair (i < j)?**
   - Yes, since the array length is at least 2.

### Strategy
To maximize `values[i] + values[j] + i - j`, we can reframe it as:
\[ \text{score} = (values[i] + i) + (values[j] - j) \]
Here, the term `(values[i] + i)` should be maximized while iterating through the array, and for each position `j`, we calculate the potential score and update the answer.

1. Precompute the maximum value of `(values[i] + i)` as we iterate through the array.
2. For each `j`, compute the score as the maximum value encountered so far plus `(values[j] - j)`.
3. Update the maximum score accordingly.

### Code
```python
def maxScoreSightseeingPair(values):
    max_score = 0
    max_i_value = values[0] + 0  # Initially consider the first element

    for j in range(1, len(values)):
        # Calculate the score for the current j
        score = max_i_value + values[j] - j
        # Update the maximum score encountered so far
        max_score = max(max_score, score)
        # Update the maximum values[i] + i encountered so far
        max_i_value = max(max_i_value, values[j] + j)

    return max_score
```

### Time Complexity
The solution runs in \( O(n) \) time, where \( n \) is the length of the input array. This is because we iterate through the array once, maintaining and updating the necessary variables in constant time.

### Summary
In this approach:
1. We maintain a running maximum of the term \( values[i] + i \) as we iterate through the array.
2. For each new spot \( j \), we update the potential score using this precomputed maximum.
3. The algorithm is efficient and operates in linear time \( O(n) \), making it suitable for large input sizes up to 50,000.
