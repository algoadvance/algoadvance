title:  Profitable Schemes-out

You are the leader of a gang and you have `n` members, each having a certain level of criminal expertise measured in integer units. You are planning to execute a list of crimes. Each crime `i` has a profit `profit[i]` and requires `group[i]` members to participate. 

Your goal is to determine the number of different subsets of crimes that can be chosen such that the profit from these crimes is at least `minProfit`.

Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

#### Example:

**Input:**
- `n = 5`
- `minProfit = 3`
- `group = [2, 2]`
- `profit = [2, 3]`

**Output:** `2`

**Explanation:**
To achieve at least 3 profit, there are 2 schemes:
1. Choose crime 0 and crime 1 which results in a profit of 2 + 3 = 5 and requires 2 + 2 = 4 members.
2. Choose crime 1 which results in a profit of 3 and requires 2 members.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the units of profit always non-negative integers?**
   - Yes, profits will always be non-negative integers.
 
2. **Can the number of members required for a crime exceed the total number of gang members `n`?**
   - No, any crime `i` with `group[i]` members required will always have `group[i] <= n`.

3. **Is it necessary to achieve the exact `minProfit` or can we exceed it?**
   - You can exceed `minProfit`.

4. **What should we return if no subset of crimes can achieve the `minProfit`?**
   - Return `0`.

### Strategy

We can use dynamic programming (DP) to solve this problem. The problem can be broken down into states that can be stored in a DP table.

Define `dp[i][j][k]` as the number of subsets of the first `i` crimes that use exactly `j` members and achieve at least `k` profit. 

We can update our DP table as follows:
1. If we do not take the current crime, the state remains the same.
2. If we take the current crime, we update our state by including the current crime's member and profit requirement.

### Code

```python
def profitableSchemes(n, minProfit, group, profit):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    # Initialize dp array: dp[j][k] -> number of ways to select crimes resulting in at least k profit and using j members
    dp = [[0] * (minProfit + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 1  # Using 0 members and 0 profit, there's one way to do nothing.

    for g, p in zip(group, profit):
        # Traverse backwards to avoid using updated results in the same iteration
        for j in range(n, g - 1, -1):
            for k in range(minProfit, -1, -1):
                dp[j][k] += dp[j - g][max(0, k - p)]
                dp[j][k] %= MOD

    return sum(dp[j][minProfit] for j in range(n+1)) % MOD

# Example usage
n = 5
minProfit = 3
group = [2, 2]
profit = [2, 3]
print(profitableSchemes(n, minProfit, group, profit))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n \times \text{len(group)} \times minProfit)\)
  - Iterating over all elements of `group` and `profit`, and updating the `dp` matrix.
  - For each group, we might need to traverse up to `n \times minProfit` states.
  
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n \times minProfit)\)
  - The DP table requires \(n \times minProfit + 1\) space.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count all possible schemes while maintaining a manageable time complexity given the problem constraints.
