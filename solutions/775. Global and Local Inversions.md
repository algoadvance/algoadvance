title:  Global and Local Inversions-out

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, where `nums` is a permutation of the numbers in the range `[0, n - 1]`.

The number of **global inversions** is the number of the different pairs `(i, j)` where:
- `0 <= i < j < n`
- `nums[i] > nums[j]`

The number of **local inversions** is the number of indices `i` where:
- `0 <= i < n - 1`
- `nums[i] > nums[i + 1]`

Given an array `nums`, return `true` if the number of global inversions is equal to the number of local inversions.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the typical size of the input array `nums`?
   - We need to know for assessing the efficiency.
   
2. **Permutations**: Can we assume that `nums` will always be a permutation of numbers `[0, n-1]`?
   - This assumption simplifies the logic as each number is unique and we can leverage its properties.

3. **Edge Cases**: Are there any edge cases we should be considerate of?
   - E.g., smallest possible arrays `[0]` or `[1, 0]`.

### Code

```python
def isIdealPermutation(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    # Checking the main condition for ideal permutation
    for i in range(n):
        # If a number is found whose position difference is more than 1
        # it means there is a global inversion which is not local 
        # since local inversions must be between adjacent numbers
        if abs(nums[i] - i) > 1:
            return False
    return True

# Example Usage
print(isIdealPermutation([1, 0, 2]))  # Output should be True
print(isIdealPermutation([1, 2, 0]))  # Output should be False
```

### Strategy

The key insight here is to recognize that for the number of global inversions to be equal to the number of local inversions, there cannot be any global inversions that are not local. In other words, every inversion must be between adjacent elements.

For each element `nums[i]` in the array `nums`, the ideal position it should be in is `i` because itâ€™s a permutation of `[0, n-1]`. If `nums[i]` is off by more than 1 position from `i`, then there is a global inversion that is not a local inversion.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** where n is the number of elements in `nums`. This is because we are iterating through the array once performing a constant time check for each element. The space complexity is **O(1)** as we are using a constant amount of additional space.
