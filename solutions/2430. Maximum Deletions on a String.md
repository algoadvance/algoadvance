title:  Maximum Deletions on a String-out
permalink: /s2430
---

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. In one operation, you can delete any one of its substrings of length `k` such that `substring sum` of the substring is greater than any other substring sum of any other substring of length `k` in the given string. The `substring sum` is defined as the sum of ASCII values of the characters in the substring.

Return the maximum number of such operations you can perform on the given string `s` before it becomes empty. If no such operation can be performed, return 0.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the exact definition of "substring sum"?**
   - Substring sum is defined as the sum of ASCII values of the characters in the substring.
   
2. **What range of values can `k` take in the problems?**
   - Since not specified, assume `k` ranges from 1 to the length of the string `s`.

3. **What should be the output if there are multiple substrings with the same maximum substring sum?**
   - The problem suggests removing just one substring per operation, so if there are multiple substrings with the same maximum sum, choose any one arbitrarily.

4. **Can `k` change between deletions?**
   - The operations are defined per a fixed `k` during each operation sequence.

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Pick a length `k` for the substring.
2. **Compute Substring Sum**: For each possible substring of length `k`, compute its substring sum.
3. **Find Maximum Substring Sum**: Identify the maximum substring sum.
4. **Delete the Substring**: Remove the first occurrence of the substring with the maximum sum.
5. **Repeat Until Empty**: Perform the above steps iteratively until the string becomes empty.
6. **Track Operations**: Keep a count of operations performed.

Given the complexity of removing substrings and recomputing sums, we should prioritize efficiency.

## Code

```python
def maxDeletions(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    if len(s) < k:
        return 0
    
    def ascii_sum(sub):
        return sum(ord(c) for c in sub)
    
    operations = 0
    
    while len(s) >= k:
        max_sum = -1
        max_sub = ""
        for i in range(len(s) - k + 1):
            sub = s[i:i+k]
            current_sum = ascii_sum(sub)
            if current_sum > max_sum:
                max_sum = current_sum
                max_sub = sub
        
        # Remove first occurrence of max_sub
        s = s.replace(max_sub, "", 1)
        operations += 1
    
    return operations

# Example usage:
s = "abcdefgh"
k = 2
print(maxDeletions(s, k))  # Output depends on the specific deletions that happen
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Iterable Length (`while` loop)**: Up to `n` deletions (string length `n`).
2. **Substring Generation and Comparison (`for` loop)**: Each iteration, all substrings of length `k` (approximately `O(n)` substrings).
3. **Sum Calculation (`ascii_sum`)**: Summing over `k` characters (constant `k`).

Therefore, overall complexity: 
\[ O(n^2 \cdot k) \]
This complexity is driven mainly by the nested substring and sum computation within iterative deletions, making it quadratic in nature. 

Optimizations could be considered if `k` is relatively constant or by minimizing redundant substring sum calculations.
