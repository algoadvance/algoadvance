title:  Sorting Three Groups-out
permalink: /s2826
---
Given an array `nums` of positive integers, sort the elements into three groups. Specifically, group all occurrences of the number 1 together, all occurrences of the number 2 together, and all occurrences of the number 3 together. The order of the numbers within each group does not matter. Return the rearranged array.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the input array guaranteed to contain only 1s, 2s, and 3s?**
   Yes, the input array will contain only 1s, 2s, and 3s.

2. **Can the input array be empty?**
   No, the input array will always contain at least one element.

3. **Should we return the result in-place or can we use extra space?**
   You can use extra space for the output, but an optimal solution in-place is preferred.

4. **What is the expected output format?**
   The function should return a list with sorted elements grouped together.

## Strategy
We can solve this problem using the Dutch National Flag algorithm, which is efficient for sorting an array of three distinct elements. The goal is to arrange the numbers in such a way that:
- All `1`s come first.
- All `2`s come next.
- All `3`s come last.

The Dutch National Flag algorithm works as follows:
1. **Initialize three pointers:**
   - `low` to track the end of 1s.
   - `mid` to iterate through the array.
   - `high` to track the start of 3s.
   
2. **Traverse the array with the `mid` pointer:**
   - If `nums[mid] == 1`, swap it with `nums[low]` and move both `low` and `mid` pointers forward.
   - If `nums[mid] == 2`, move the `mid` pointer forward.
   - If `nums[mid] == 3`, swap it with `nums[high]` and move the `high` pointer backward.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of elements in the array, as each element is processed at most once. The space complexity is `O(1)` since we are not using any extra space proportional to the input size.

## Code
```python
def sortThreeGroups(nums):
    low, mid, high = 0, 0, len(nums) - 1
    
    while mid <= high:
        if nums[mid] == 1:
            nums[low], nums[mid] = nums[mid], nums[low]
            low += 1
            mid += 1
        elif nums[mid] == 2:
            mid += 1
        else:  # nums[mid] == 3
            nums[high], nums[mid] = nums[mid], nums[high]
            high -= 1
    
    return nums

# Example Usage
nums = [3, 2, 2, 1, 3, 1]
sorted_nums = sortThreeGroups(nums)
print(sorted_nums)  # Output might be [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3] but any order satisfying the grouping is correct.
```

This will correctly group the elements as required in a single pass through the array.
