title:  Number of Orders in the Backlog-out
permalink: /s1801
---

You are given a 2D array `orders`, where each order is represented as an array of three integers: `[price, amount, orderType]`.

- `price` is the price of the share.
- `amount` is the amount of shares.
- `orderType` is whether the order is a buy order (`orderType = 0`) or a sell order (`orderType = 1`).

There is a backlog that can hold buy and sell orders. Each buy order is willing to purchase shares at or below a specified price. Likewise, each sell order is willing to sell shares at or above a specified price.

Whenever a new order comes in, the order will try to match with the opposite order in the backlog. When matching, the order with the higher priority (higher price for buy orders and lower price for sell orders) should be filled first.

Calculate the total number of shares that remain in the backlog after all orders have been processed. Since the number can be large, return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are `price`, `amount`, and `orderType` always non-negative and within a specific range?**

   Typically, yes. The problem constraints should ensure valid input values.

2. **Can we assume all input orders are well-formed (i.e., the array length is divisible by 3 and each individual order has exactly three elements)?**

   Yes, we can assume the input is well-formed as per the problem statement.

3. **What should be done if the `amount` is zero after a match?**

   If the `amount` of shares of an order becomes zero after a match, remove that order from the backlog.

## Strategy

1. **Use Priority Queues**: 
   - Use a max-heap to store buy orders, where the maximum price should be given higher priority.
   - Use a min-heap to store sell orders, where the minimum price should be given higher priority.

2. **Processing Logic**:
   - For each order, try to match it with the opposite orders in the backlog.
   - If the order is a buy order, match it with the lowest selling price that is less than or equal to the order’s price.
   - If the order is a sell order, match it with the highest buying price that is greater than or equal to the order’s price.

3. **Insert Orders**:
   - If an order can’t be fully matched, insert the remaining part into the corresponding backlog (heap).

4. **Result Calculation**:
   - After processing all orders, sum up the remaining shares in the buy and sell backlogs, and return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Code

```python
import heapq

def getNumberOfBacklogOrders(orders):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    buy_heap = []  # max-heap for buy orders (invert prices to use with heapq since it's a min-heap by default)
    sell_heap = []  # min-heap for sell orders

    for price, amount, orderType in orders:
        if orderType == 0:  # buy order
            while amount > 0 and sell_heap and sell_heap[0][0] <= price:
                sell_order_price, sell_order_amount = heapq.heappop(sell_heap)
                if sell_order_amount > amount:
                    heapq.heappush(sell_heap, (sell_order_price, sell_order_amount - amount))
                    amount = 0
                else:
                    amount -= sell_order_amount

            if amount > 0:
                heapq.heappush(buy_heap, (-price, amount))

        else:  # sell order
            while amount > 0 and buy_heap and -buy_heap[0][0] >= price:
                buy_order_price, buy_order_amount = heapq.heappop(buy_heap)
                if buy_order_amount > amount:
                    heapq.heappush(buy_heap, (buy_order_price, buy_order_amount - amount))
                    amount = 0
                else:
                    amount -= buy_order_amount

            if amount > 0:
                heapq.heappush(sell_heap, (price, amount))

    total_amount = 0
    for _, amount in buy_heap:
        total_amount += amount
    for _, amount in sell_heap:
        total_amount += amount

    return total_amount % MOD
```

## Time Complexity

- **Processing Orders**: Each order might need to interact with elements in the heaps. In the worst case, each order will take `O(log N)` for insertion or extraction in the heap, where `N` is the number of orders.

- **Overall Time Complexity**: If there were `M` orders, the total time complexity would be `O(M * log M)`.

Thus, the solution is efficient and should handle the constraints typically found in competitive programming environments.
