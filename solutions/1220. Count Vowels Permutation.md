title:  Count Vowels Permutation-out
permalink: /s1220

Given an integer `n`, your task is to count how many strings of length `n` can be formed using vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') under the following rules:

- Each character is a vowel.
- Each vowel `'a'` may only be followed by an `'e'`.
- Each vowel `'e'` may only be followed by an `'a'` or `'i'`.
- Each vowel `'i'` may not be followed by another `'i'`.
- Each vowel `'o'` may only be followed by an `'i'` or `'u'`.
- Each vowel `'u'` may only be followed by an `'a'`.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can `n` be negative or zero? 
   - Constraint: `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4`.
2. Are we allowed to only use the vowels `'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'`?
   - Yes.
3. Should the result be returned modulo `10^9 + 7`?
   - Yes, as mentioned in the problem statement.

## Strategy

We will solve this problem using dynamic programming (DP). Let's define the DP state `dp[i][c]` as the number of valid strings of length `i` ending with vowel `c`.

The strategy will involve iterating from length `1` to `n` and keeping track of the number of valid strings that can end with each vowel, considering the given constraints.

1. Initialize DP table:
   - `dp[1][a]`, `dp[1][e]`, `dp[1][i]`, `dp[1][o]`, `dp[1][u]` should all be `1`.

2. Transition:
   - Based on the last character and the rules, update the current number of valid strings for each vowel.

3. Result:
   - The result will be the sum of the strings of length `n` for all possible ending vowels.

## Code

```python
def countVowelPermutation(n: int) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    # dp array containing the count for 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' respectively
    dp = [1] * 5 # Starting state for n=1
    
    for _ in range(1, n):
        new_dp = [0] * 5
        # Update the `dp` according to the rules specified
        new_dp[0] = (dp[1] + dp[2] + dp[4]) % MOD  # a follows e, i, u
        new_dp[1] = (dp[0] + dp[2]) % MOD         # e follows a, i
        new_dp[2] = (dp[1] + dp[3]) % MOD         # i follows e, o
        new_dp[3] = dp[2] % MOD                   # o follows i
        new_dp[4] = (dp[2] + dp[3]) % MOD         # u follows i, o
        
        dp = new_dp
    
    return sum(dp) % MOD

# Example Usage:
# n = 5
# print(countVowelPermutation(n))  # Output the total number of valid vowel permutations
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is \( O(n) \) since we iterate from 1 to `n` and perform a constant-time update of the DP table in each iteration.

- **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \) apart from the space required to store the input, as we are using a fixed-size array (5 elements) for our DP state transitions.
