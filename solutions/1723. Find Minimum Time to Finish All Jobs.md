title:  Find Minimum Time to Finish All Jobs-out
permalink: /s1723
---

You are given `n` jobs and `k` workers. Each job has its own difficulty measure. The `i-th` job takes `jobs[i]` amount of time to complete. You need to assign each job to exactly one worker such that the maximum time taken by any worker is minimized.

The goal is to find the minimum possible value of the maximum time taken by any worker to complete their assigned jobs.

**Example:**

```text
Input: jobs = [3, 2, 3], k = 3
Output: 3 
Explanation: By assigning each of the workers one of the jobs, the maximum time taken by any worker is 3.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= jobs.length <= 12`
- `1 <= jobs[i] <= 10^7`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are there any constraints on how we can assign the jobs to the workers?
2. Does the order of job assignment matter?

## Strategy

Given the constraints, we can use a backtracking algorithm with pruning (also known as depth-first search, DFS) to explore all possible ways to assign jobs, but we will leverage Binary Search to minimize the maximum workload. Here are the steps:

1. **Sort the Jobs**: To optimize the backtracking process, sort the jobs array in descending order. This helps in early pruning by trying to place larger jobs first.
2. **Binary Search on Maximum Time**: Binary search on the answer to find the minimal maximum time that any worker would have to work.
3. **Check Feasibility**: For each midpoint in the binary search, use a backtracking method to check if it's possible to finish all jobs such that no worker works more than the midpoint time.

## Code

```python
def minimumTimeRequired(jobs, k):
    def canFinish(jobs, k, mid):
        workers = [0] * k

        def dfs(index):
            if index == len(jobs):
                return True
            for i in range(k):
                if workers[i] + jobs[index] <= mid:
                    workers[i] += jobs[index]
                    if dfs(index + 1):
                        return True
                    workers[i] -= jobs[index]
                if workers[i] == 0:
                    break
            return False

        return dfs(0)

    jobs.sort(reverse=True)
    left, right = max(jobs), sum(jobs)
    
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if canFinish(jobs, k, mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
            
    return left

# Example usage
jobs = [3, 2, 3]
k = 3
print(minimumTimeRequired(jobs, k))  # Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting the jobs**: \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Binary Search**: \(O(\log(\text{sum(jobs)} - \text{max(jobs)}))\)
- **Backtracking**: In the worst case, we explore all possible assignments of jobs, leading to \(O(k^n)\), but the actual number of explorations is significantly pruned by the feasibility checks.

The overall time complexity can be approximated as \(O(n \log n + \log(\text{sum(jobs)}) \times k^n)\), where the backtracking heavily leans on pruning to reduce the actual number of recursive calls.
