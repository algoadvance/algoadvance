title:  Cinema Seat Allocation-out
permalink: /s1386
---

You own a cinema and you want to allocate seats to the customers. The cinema has a total of 10 rows, and each row contains 10 seats labeled from 1 to 10 (inclusive). Given the list of reserved seats, your task is to determine the maximum number of families that can be seated together in the cinema. A family consists of four members, and they need to sit together in four consecutive seats in the same row and may only sit in seats 2-5, 4-7, or 6-9 to ensure that the seats next to them are not occupied.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format**: What is the format of the input?
   The input consists of a total number of rows (always 10 as per the problem statement) and a list of reserved seats, where each reserved seat is represented by a tuple containing row and seat number.

2. **Output Format**: What should the output be?
   The output should be an integer representing the maximum number of families that can be seated together.

3. **Seat Boundaries**: If a row has a reserved seat in the boundary of a family seating (e.g., seat 3 or seat 6), does it affect all possible positions?
   Yes, if a seat in the seating boundaries is reserved, it affects potential family seating in positions 2-5, 4-7, and 6-9, respectively.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Setup**:
   - Create a dictionary to track reserved seats for each row.
   - Iterate through the list of reserved seats and populate the dictionary.

2. **Check Empty Rows**:
   - An empty row means you can seat two families (4 seats per family, three configurations possible per row).

3. **Check Reserved Rows**:
   - For rows with reserved seats, check all three configurations (2-5, 4-7, 6-9).
   - A row can accommodate up to two families if possible configurations do not overlap and are not reserved.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - Sum the number of families that can be seated for all rows.

### Code

```python
def maxNumberOfFamilies(n: int, reservedSeats: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    from collections import defaultdict

    reserved = defaultdict(set)
    
    # Populate the reserved dictionary with row and reserved seats information
    for seat in reservedSeats:
        row, col = seat
        reserved[row].add(col)
    
    max_families = 0
    
    for row in range(1, n + 1):
        if row not in reserved:
            # If the row is completely empty, we can fit 2 families
            max_families += 2
        else:
            # Check for each configuration
            left = middle = right = True
            
            # Check if seats from 2 to 5 are not reserved
            for seat in range(2, 6):
                if seat in reserved[row]:
                    left = False
                    break
            
            # Check if seats from 4 to 7 are not reserved
            for seat in range(4, 8):
                if seat in reserved[row]:
                    middle = False
                    break
            
            # Check if seats from 6 to 9 are not reserved
            for seat in range(6, 10):
                if seat in reserved[row]:
                    right = False
                    break
            
            if left and right:
                max_families += 2  # Can fit two families
            elif left or middle or right:
                max_families += 1  # Can fit one family
                
    return max_families

# Example usage
seats = [[1, 2], [1, 3], [1, 8], [2, 6], [3, 1], [3, 10]]
n = 3  # number of rows
print(maxNumberOfFamilies(n, seats))  # Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity

- **Dictionary Population**: \(O(k)\) where \(k\) is the number of reserved seats.
- **Row Iteration and Seat Check**: \(O(n \cdot m)\) where \(n\) is the number of rows and \(m\) is a constant (9 checks per row).
- **Overall Time Complexity**: \(O(k + n)\) which should be efficient given the constraints.

This code maximizes the number of families seated by checking each configuration carefully and ensuring the space required is empty.
