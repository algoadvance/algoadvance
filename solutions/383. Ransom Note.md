Given two strings `ransomNote` and `magazine`, return `true` if `ransomNote` can be constructed from the letters in `magazine` and `false` otherwise.

Each letter in `magazine` can only be used once in `ransomNote`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Case Sensitivity**: Should the comparison be case-sensitive? (Assume yes for this problem unless otherwise stated)
2. **Non-alphabetic characters**: Can we assume only alphabetic characters in both strings?
3. **Input Length**: Is there an upper bound on the length of the input strings?

Assuming the answers align with common problem constraints:
1. Yes, the comparison is case-sensitive.
2. Yes, we are only dealing with lower-case English letters.
3. Inputs can be reasonably large, up to tens of thousands of characters.

### Strategy

1. **Frequency Counts**: We'll use a histogram (or frequency count) approach. This involves counting the occurrences of each character in both `ransomNote` and `magazine`.
2. **Comparison**: For each unique character in `ransomNote`, verify that the corresponding count in `magazine` is at least as large.
3. **Return Result**: Return `true` if all characters in `ransomNote` are sufficiently available in `magazine`, otherwise return `false`.

### Code

```python
def canConstruct(ransomNote, magazine):
    from collections import Counter

    ransom_counter = Counter(ransomNote)
    magazine_counter = Counter(magazine)

    for char, count in ransom_counter.items():
        if magazine_counter[char] < count:
            return False

    return True
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Counting Frequencies**: Creating the frequency histograms for both strings takes \(O(n + m)\) time, where \(n\) is the length of `ransomNote` and \(m\) is the length of `magazine`.
2. **Comparing Counts**: Checking the counts involves iterating over the unique characters in `ransomNote`, which is \(O(k)\) where \(k\) is the number of unique characters in `ransomNote`.

**Overall Time Complexity**: \(O(n + m)\)

This approach should be efficient for the input sizes generally considered in these types of problems.
