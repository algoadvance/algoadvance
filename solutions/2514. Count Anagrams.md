LeetCode problem 2514: "Count Anagrams"

You are given a string `s` containing one or more words. A word is a substring containing only English letters and is surrounded by either spaces or the string boundaries. Your task is to determine the number of anagrams of each word in the string `s`.

**Constraints:**
- The string `s` may contain upper and lower case letters and spaces.
- Multiple spaces can be contained between words.

### Example
```python
s = "abc cba"
Output: 2
Explanation: There are 2 words, "abc" and "cba". Both are anagrams of each other. So, the output is 2.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we return as the output?** Is it the count of distinct sets of anagrams or the total number of anagram pairs?
   - The problem seems to be asking for the counting of individual words that have anagrams among them.

2. **Do uppercase and lowercase letters affect anagram comparison?**
   - This needs clarification. Typically anagram checks are case-insensitive.

3. **How to handle multiple spaces?**
   - Words should be delimited by one or more spaces.

### Strategy

1. **Normalize the Input:**
   - Convert all words to lower case for case-insensitive comparison.
   - Split the string using `split()` function which conveniently handles multiple spaces.

2. **Character Frequency Counting:**
   - Use a dictionary to map character frequency counts to list of words with matching frequencies. This will help in identifying anagrams.

3. **Count Anagrams:**
   - Use the `collections.Counter` to count character frequencies of each word and use this as a key in our dictionary.

4. **Result Calculation:**
   - The number of anagrams of a word can be derived from the dictionary by counting the size of the list of words that match its character frequency. Sum these counts to get the final result.

### Code

```python
from collections import Counter

def count_anagrams(s: str) -> int:
    # Normalize the input
    words = s.lower().split()
    
    # Dictionary to store character count as key and list of words as value
    anagram_dict = {}
    
    for word in words:
        # Generate a character frequency tuple
        char_count = tuple(sorted(Counter(word).items()))
        
        if char_count in anagram_dict:
            anagram_dict[char_count].append(word)
        else:
            anagram_dict[char_count] = [word]
    
    # Calculate the number of anagrams
    total_anagrams = 0
    for words_list in anagram_dict.values():
        if len(words_list) > 1:
            total_anagrams += len(words_list)
    
    return total_anagrams

# Example usage
s = "abc cba"
print(count_anagrams(s))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for the approach described above is:

- **Splitting the String:** \(O(N)\) where \(N\) is the length of the string.
- **Sorting and Counting Characters:** Each word is sorted and counted, leading to \(O(M \log M)\) for each word where M is the length of the word. For all words total it's proportional to the sum of the lengths.

Thus, the overall complexity can be approximated as \(O(N + W \log M)\), where \(W\) is the total number of characters in all words combined.

### Space Complexity

- **Dictionary Storage:** In the worst case, we store an entry for each unique word, which is \(O(K)\) where \(K\) is the number of unique character frequency patterns.
- **Intermediate Storage:** We may also store intermediate character counts and sorted versions which adds up linearly to the input size.

Hence, the space complexity roughly is \(O(K)\) where \(K\) is proportional to the number of unique anagram groups formed from words.
