title:  Minimum Fuel Cost to Report to the Capital-out
permalink: /s2477
---

You are given a tree (an acyclic, connected graph) with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, and the tree is rooted at node `0`. The nodes represent cities, and the edges represent roads that are bidirectional and have a unit distance.

There is a car in each city, and each car has a seat count which is the same. Your task is to calculate the minimum number of seats required in each car to minimize the cost for all the cities to report to the capital (i.e., node `0`).

Each car consumes 1 unit of fuel per unit distance. The cost to report is the total fuel consumed by all the cars.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the structure of the input?
   - The input consists of an integer `seats` and an array of edges, where `edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates there is a bidirectional road between node `a_i` and node `b_i`.

2. What is the expected output?
   - The output is an integer representing the minimum fuel cost required for all cities to report to the capital.

3. Are there any constraints on the number of nodes and cars?
   - Yes, it is mentioned that there are `n` nodes and each node corresponds to a single city and has one car with a given seat count.

4. Are there any constraints on the weights of the edges?
   - The roads have a unit distance, so each edge has a weight of 1.

## Strategy

1. **Tree Representation**: Represent the tree using an adjacency list.
2. **DFS Traversal**: Utilize Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree from the root node (node `0`).
3. **Subtree Size**: Calculate the size of each subtree to determine how many trips are needed based on the car's seat count.
4. **Fuel Calculation**: During the DFS traversal, calculate the fuel cost based on the subtree sizes and the number of trips required for each subtree to reach the capital.

### Steps

1. Construct the adjacency list from the given edges.
2. Perform a DFS from the capital node (node `0`) and calculate the size of each subtree.
3. While returning in the DFS, compute the fuel cost for each subtree and propagate this information up to the root.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes (cities). This is because DFS traverses each node and edge exactly once.

## Code

```python
def minimumFuelCost(seats, edges):
    from collections import defaultdict, deque
    
    # Step 1: Construct the adjacency list
    adj_list = defaultdict(list)
    for a, b in edges:
        adj_list[a].append(b)
        adj_list[b].append(a)
    
    # Step 2: Perform DFS to calculate subtree sizes and fuel cost
    def dfs(node, parent, seats):
        total_size = 1  # Include the current node
        total_fuel_cost = 0
        for neighbor in adj_list[node]:
            if neighbor != parent:
                subtree_size, subtree_fuel_cost = dfs(neighbor, node, seats)
                total_size += subtree_size
                total_fuel_cost += subtree_fuel_cost
                # Calculate the number of trips to bring the subtree_size people to the parent
                trips = (subtree_size + seats - 1) // seats
                total_fuel_cost += trips  # Each trip is a unit distance to the parent

        return total_size, total_fuel_cost
    
    # Start DFS from the capital (node 0), which has no parent (-1)
    _, total_fuel_cost = dfs(0, -1, seats)
    
    return total_fuel_cost

# Example usage:
seats = 4
edges = [[0,1], [1,2], [1,3], [3,4], [3,5]]

print(minimumFuelCost(seats, edges))  # Output will depend on the actual tree structure
```

This solution leverages DFS to compute subtree sizes and accumulates the fuel cost based on the number of trips required for each subtree to report to the parent node, ultimately summing up these costs to get the total fuel required to report to the capital.
