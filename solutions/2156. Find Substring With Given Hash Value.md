title:  Find Substring With Given Hash Value-out
permalink: /s2156
---

You are given a string `s` and two integers `p` and `m`. The hash function is defined as:
```plaintext
hash(s, p, m) = (sum(s[i] * p^i for i in range(len(s))) % m) % m
```
You are also given a value `target_hash`, and you need to find a substring of length `k` in `s` such that the hash of this substring equals `target_hash`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q:** What is the range of the lengths of the string `s` and `k`?
   - **A:** The length of `s` can be up to \(10^5\) and \(k\) will be a valid length within `s` meaning \(1 \leq k \leq \text{len}(s)\).

2. **Q:** What characters are included in the string `s`?
   - **A:** The string `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

3. **Q:** Should the hash function use 1-based indexing or 0-based indexing?
   - **A:** The hash function should use 0-based indexing as specified.

### Strategy:

1. **Compute the hash for the first substring of length `k`:**
   - Calculate the initial hash value for the substring `s[0:k]`.

2. **Use a rolling hash technique for efficiency:**
   - Compute the hash for substrings `s[1:k+1], s[2:k+2], ...` by removing the effect of the first character of the previous substring and adding the effect of the new character.

3. **Update hash efficiently using:**
   - `hash(s[i+1:k+i+1])` from `hash(s[i:k+i])`:
     ```plaintext
     hash(s[i+1:k+i+1]) = ((current_hash - s[i] * p^0) // p + s[k+i] * p^(k-1)) % m
     ```

### Code:

```python
def findSubstring(s, p, m, k, target_hash):
    def compute_initial_hash(substring):
        hash_value = 0
        for i in range(len(substring)):
            hash_value = (hash_value + (ord(substring[i]) - ord('a') + 1) * pow(p, i, m)) % m
        return hash_value

    n = len(s)
    if n < k:
        return ""

    current_hash = compute_initial_hash(s[:k])

    if current_hash == target_hash:
        return s[:k]

    p_k_minus_1 = pow(p, k - 1, m)

    for i in range(1, n - k + 1):
        current_hash = (current_hash - (ord(s[i - 1]) - ord('a') + 1)) * pow(p, m-2, m) % m
        current_hash = (current_hash + (ord(s[i + k - 1]) - ord('a') + 1) * p_k_minus_1) % m

        if current_hash == target_hash:
            return s[i:i + k]
            
    return ""

# Example usage:
s = "abcdefghijk"
p = 31
m = 1000000007
k = 3
target_hash = some_target_value 

result = findSubstring(s, p, m, k, target_hash)
print(result)
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Initial Hash Computation:**
  - `O(k)`

- **Rolling Hash Computation:**
  - For each substring starting from index 1 to `n-k`:
    - Update hash in `O(1)` 

Overall time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

### Conclusion:

The above solution efficiently uses a sliding window and rolling hash technique to compute the hashes for potential substrings and checks them against the `target_hash`. This ensures that the solution is optimal and works within the constraints provided.
