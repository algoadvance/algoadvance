title:  Sum of Digit Differences of All Pairs-out
permalink: /s3153
---

You are given an integer array, `nums`. You need to find the sum of the absolute differences of the digits of all pairs of integers in the given array.

For example, given `nums = [123, 456]`, you need to calculate the sum of differences for pairs `(123, 456)`. The absolute differences for the corresponding digits are `|1-4| + |2-5| + |3-6|`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of input values**: What is the range of values each number in the array can take?
2. **Length of input array**: What is the maximum length of the input array?
3. **Digit Count Consistency**: Do all numbers have the same number of digits?
4. **Input Validation**: Should we account for possible invalid inputs or assume the input is well-formed?

### Strategy

1. **Convert Numbers to Strings**:
   - Since we need to compare individual digits, we can convert each number in the array to its string representation.

2. **Pair Calculation**:
   - Utilize a nested loop to iterate through all possible pairs in the array.
   - Within the loop, convert each pair of numbers to strings, and for corresponding positions, compute the absolute differences of their digits.
   - Sum these absolute differences to get the result for each pair.

3. **Summation**:
   - Accumulate the results of absolute differences for all pairs in a cumulative sum variable.

### Code

```python
from itertools import combinations

def sum_of_digit_differences(nums):
    total_sum = 0
    
    # Generate all possible pairs using combinations
    for num1, num2 in combinations(nums, 2):
        # Convert numbers to strings
        str1, str2 = str(num1), str(num2)
        
        # Calculate the number of digits to process
        max_length = max(len(str1), len(str2))
        
        # Pad the shorter number with zeros
        str1 = str1.zfill(max_length)
        str2 = str2.zfill(max_length)
        
        # Calculate the absolute digit differences
        digit_diff_sum = sum(abs(int(digit1) - int(digit2)) for digit1, digit2 in zip(str1, str2))
        
        # Add to the total sum
        total_sum += digit_diff_sum
    
    return total_sum

# Example usage
nums = [123, 456]
print(sum_of_digit_differences(nums))  # Output: 9
```

### Time Complexity

- **Pair Generation**: Generating all pairs of `n` elements requires `O(n^2)` time.
- **Digit Difference Calculation**: For each pair, calculating the digit differences takes `O(d)` time, where `d` is the maximum number of digits. In the worst case, `d` could be the number of digits of the largest number in the array.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n^2 * d)`.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(1)` extra space besides the input since at any given time we are storing the differences and sum, which do not scale with input size. However, additional space can be `O(d)` in the worst case for storing padded strings.
