title:    Count Symmetric Integers-out
permalink: /s2843
---

The problem requires us to count the number of symmetric integers within a specified range `[low, high]`. A symmetric integer is defined as an integer that remains the same when its digits are reversed. For example, `121` and `1221` are symmetric integers, but `123` is not.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range:** Are both `low` and `high` inclusive in the range?
   - Yes, both `low` and `high` are inclusive.
   
2. **Range Limits:** What are the possible values for `low` and `high`? (e.g., can they be negative?)
   - We assume `low` and `high` are non-negative integers since we're talking about digits. For simplicity, assume we are only dealing with positive integers where `low < high`.

3. **Output:** Is the output expected to be an integer indicating the count of symmetric integers?
   - Yes, the output is the count of symmetric integers within the range `[low, high]`.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we will:
1. Iterate through each integer in the range `[low, high]`.
2. For each integer, convert it to its string representation and check if it reads the same forwards and backwards.
3. If it is symmetric, increment the count.
4. Return the final count after checking all integers in the specified range.

### Code

```python
def count_symmetric_integers(low: int, high: int) -> int:
    def is_symmetric(n: int) -> bool:
        s = str(n)
        return s == s[::-1]
    
    count = 0
    for i in range(low, high + 1):
        if is_symmetric(i):
            count += 1
            
    return count

# Example usage
low, high = 10, 200
result = count_symmetric_integers(low, high)
print(f'The number of symmetric integers between {low} and {high} is {result}.')
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is \(O(n \cdot d)\), where:
- \(n\) is the number of integers in the range `[low, high]`, which is \(high - low + 1\).
- \(d\) is the average number of digits in the integers. Here, we convert each number to a string and check if the string is a palindrome.

This should be efficient enough for reasonably sized ranges. If `low` and `high` can be larger, further optimizations might be needed, but this solution is straightforward and should work well for typical input sizes in an interview scenario.
