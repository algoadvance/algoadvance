title:  Minimum Cost to Make Array Equal-out
permalink: /s2448
---

You are given two arrays `nums` and `cost`, each of length `n`, where `nums[i]` is the value of the ith element and `cost[i]` is the cost of modifying the ith element.

In one operation, you can increase or decrease the value of any element of the array `nums` by 1. The cost of modifying an element at index `i` is equal to `cost[i]`.

You need to make all the elements of the array `nums` equal. Return the minimum cost to make all elements equal.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of `nums` and `cost`:**
   What are the constraints on the values in `nums` and `cost`?
   - Usually, the problem will specify this but we can assume typical constraints used in LeetCode problems.

2. **Operation Limit:**
   Is it allowed to make an unlimited number of operations on each element?
   - Yes, as per the problem statement, you can perform any number of operations on each element.

3. **Output Type:**
   Should the result be an integer or is a floating-point result acceptable?
   - The result should be an integer, as all costs and modifications are given in integers.

### Strategy

To minimize the cost to make all elements equal:

1. **Brute-Force:** A naive approach would involve trying to make every element equal to every other element and computing the total cost, then selecting the minimum cost. This would be inefficient for large arrays (O(n^2)).

2. **Optimal Strategy:**
   - **Step 1:** Calculate the median or weighted median of the array `nums` weighted by the costs in `cost`. The intuition here is that aligning all numbers to the median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations.
   - **Step 2:** Compute the total cost to align all numbers to the calculated median.

### Code

Here is the implementation in Python following the optimal strategy:

```python
def minCost(nums, cost):
    n = len(nums)
    data = sorted(zip(nums, cost))  # Sort based on nums values
    total_cost = sum(cost)
    prefix_cost = 0
    median = None
    
    # Find the weighted median
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_cost += data[i][1]
        if prefix_cost >= total_cost / 2:
            median = data[i][0]
            break
            
    # Compute the total cost to make all elements equal to the median
    min_cost = sum(abs(num - median) * c for num, c in zip(nums, cost))
    
    return min_cost

# Test with an example input
nums = [1, 3, 5]
cost = [10, 100, 1000]
print(minCost(nums, cost))  # Output should be the minimum cost
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:`** Sorting the combined `nums` and `cost` array is O(n log n).
- **Finding the Weighted Median:`** This can be done in O(n).
- **Calculating Total Cost:** Calculating the total cost involves iterating through the array again which is O(n).

**Overall Time Complexity:** O(n log n) due to the sorting step.

This approach ensures that the minimum cost to make the array equal is efficiently computed.
