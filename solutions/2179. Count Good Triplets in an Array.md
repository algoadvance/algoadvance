title:  Count Good Triplets in an Array-out
permalink: /s2179
---

We have an array of integers `arr`, and three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. A triplet `(arr[i], arr[j], arr[k])` is considered "good" if it satisfies the following conditions:
1. `0 <= i < j < k < len(arr)`
2. `|arr[i] - arr[j]| <= a`
3. `|arr[j] - arr[k]| <= b`
4. `|arr[i] - arr[k]| <= c`

The task is to return the number of good triplets in `arr`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Array size**: What is the potential size range of the array `arr`? This will help in understanding if a brute-force solution would be feasible.
2. **Value range**: What are the possible ranges of integers in `arr` and the integers `a`, `b`, and `c`?
3. **Constraints**: Are there any special constraints or edge cases we should be aware of? For example, can `arr` be empty or contain only one element?

### Strategy

We need to count the number of "good" triplets in the given array `arr`. 

Given the constraints and conditions, the brute-force approach seems to be the starting point. The brute-force approach involves:
1. Iterating over all possible triplets `(arr[i], arr[j], arr[k])` such that `0 <= i < j < k < len(arr)`.
2. Checking if each triplet satisfies the given conditions for being "good".

Steps for the brute-force approach:
1. Loop through each `i` from `0` to `len(arr) - 3`.
2. For each `i`, loop through `j` from `i + 1` to `len(arr) - 2`.
3. For each `j`, loop through `k` from `j + 1` to `len(arr) - 1`.
4. Check if the triplet `(arr[i], arr[j], arr[k])` is "good" by verifying the given conditions.
5. Count the number of "good" triplets.

### Code

```python
def countGoodTriplets(arr, a, b, c):
    n = len(arr)
    count = 0
    
    for i in range(n - 2):
        for j in range(i + 1, n - 1):
            for k in range(j + 1, n):
                if (abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) <= a and 
                    abs(arr[j] - arr[k]) <= b and 
                    abs(arr[i] - arr[k]) <= c):
                    count += 1
    
    return count
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above brute-force approach is \(O(n^3)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array `arr`. This is because we have three nested loops, each iterating over a subset of the array. 

This approach is simple but may not be efficient for large arrays. Depending on the constraints, we might need to optimize it if `n` is large.
