title:  Maximum Odd Binary Number-out

You are given a binary string `s` (such as "010"). You need to rearrange the characters of the string in such a way that it forms the largest possible odd binary number. A binary number is odd if its last digit is `1`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Is the input string always guaranteed to contain at least one '1' (since a binary number must end in '1' to be odd)? 
   - What is the maximum length of the binary string?

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Should the output be the rearranged binary string itself or a specific format?

Assuming the input will always contain at least one '1' and the output should be the binary string.

### Strategy:
1. **Understanding Odd Binary Number**:
   - A binary number is odd if its last digit is '1'.

2. **Objective**:
   - To form the largest possible binary number with the given characters, while ensuring that the last digit is '1'.

3. **Procedure**:
   - Count the number of '1's and '0's in the input string.
   - Place all '1's except one (which will be at the end to ensure the number is odd) at the beginning for the largest magnitude.
   - Follow with all the '0's.
   - Place the last '1' at the end.

### Code:

```python
def maximumOddBinaryNumber(s: str) -> str:
    # Count the number of '1's and '0's
    ones = s.count('1')
    zeros = s.count('0')
    
    # Form the largest number by putting (ones-1) '1's, then all '0's, and end with one '1'.
    result = '1' * (ones - 1) + '0' * zeros + '1'
    
    return result

# Example Usage
s = "010"
print(maximumOddBinaryNumber(s))  # Output should be "101"
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Counting `1`s and  `0`s**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string.
- **Constructing the result string**: \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is \(O(n)\).
