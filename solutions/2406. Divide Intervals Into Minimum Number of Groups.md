title:  Divide Intervals Into Minimum Number of Groups-out
permalink: /s2406
---

You are given a 2D integer array `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [lefti, righti]` represents the inclusive interval `[lefti, righti]`.

You need to divide the intervals into the minimum number of groups so that no two intervals in the same group overlap. Return the minimum number of groups you need to make.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:** 
    - What is the maximum number of intervals we can expect?
    - What is the range of the values for the `lefti` and `righti` elements in each interval?
  
2. **Output Details:**
    - Should the result be the minimum number of groups as an integer?
    
3. **Overlap Clarification:**
    - Is an interval `[a, b]` considered overlapping with `[b, c]`?

Assuming the maximum constraints are reasonable and the overlap definition implies that intervals touching at boundaries do overlap.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can adopt the following approach:

1. **Event Scheduling:**
    - Treat each interval as two events: a start and an end.
    - We focus on how many intervals are active at any point in time.

2. **Mapping Events:**
    - Create an event list where each start point of an interval adds to the count and each end point subtracts from the count.

3. **Simulate the Timeline:**
    - Traverse through these events sorted by the time; track the maximum number of overlapping intervals.

### Code

Here is the implementation in Python:

```python
def minGroups(intervals):
    events = []

    for left, right in intervals:
        # Create event at the start of the interval and end + 1 of the interval.
        events.append((left, 1))   # Starting an interval
        events.append((right + 1, -1))  # Ending an interval

    # Sort events first by time, then by type (ensuring ends come before starts if they are at the same time)
    events.sort()

    max_groups = 0
    current_groups = 0

    for event in events:
        current_groups += event[1]
        max_groups = max(max_groups, current_groups)

    return max_groups

# Example Usage
intervals = [
    [1, 3], [2, 4], [3, 5], [10, 15], [5, 10]
]
print(minGroups(intervals))  # Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting Events:** Since we need to sort the events, this step has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of interval events (which equals \(2 \times \text{number of intervals}\)).
- **Processing Events:** After sorting, we process each event in linear time \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the maximum overlap, thereby computing the minimum number of groups required.
