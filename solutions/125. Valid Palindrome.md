Given a string `s`, determine if it is a palindrome, considering only alphanumeric characters and ignoring cases.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format**: Can the input string contain spaces and punctuation? 
   - **Yes**, any string may include spaces, punctuation, and other non-alphanumeric characters.
2. **Output Format**: Do I return a boolean value?
   - **Yes**, return `True` if the input string is a palindrome, otherwise return `False`.
3. **Case Sensitivity**: Should the comparison be case-insensitive?
   - **Yes**, treat uppercase and lowercase letters as the same character.

### Strategy
1. **Filtering and Normalization**: 
   - First, filter out non-alphanumeric characters from the string.
   - Convert all characters to lowercase to ensure the comparison is case-insensitive.
2. **Palindrome Check**: 
   - Check if the filtered and normalized string reads the same forwards and backwards.

### Code
```python
def isPalindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    # Remove non-alphanumeric characters and convert to lowercase.
    filtered_chars = [char.lower() for char in s if char.isalnum()]
    
    # Check if the processed characters form a palindrome.
    return filtered_chars == filtered_chars[::-1]

# Example usage
print(isPalindrome("A man, a plan, a canal: Panama"))  # Output: True
print(isPalindrome("race a car"))                     # Output: False
```

### Time Complexity
- **Filtering and Normalization**: This operation iterates through each character of the string, so its time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string.
- **Palindrome Check**: Comparing the list to its reversed version also takes \(O(n)\) time.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is \(O(n)\).
