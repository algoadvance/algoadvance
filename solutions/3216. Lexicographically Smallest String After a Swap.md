title:  Lexicographically Smallest String After a Swap-out
permalink: /s3216
---

Given a string `s`, no longer than 4,000 characters, and a list `pairs` of pairs of indices in the string (0-indexed), determine the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained by swapping the characters at the indices in the given pairs any number of times.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the pairs?** 
   - Pairs may indicate any valid indices in the string, and they could contain duplicate pairs or indices.

2. **Can swaps be done transitively?**
   - Yes, if index `i` can be swapped with `j`, and `j` with `k`, then effectively `i` can be swapped with `k`.

3. **What should we return if no swaps are possible?**
   - Return the original string as it is already the smallest possible.

4. **Are pairs bidirectional?**
   - Yes, if (i, j) is in pairs, you can swap both i with j and j with i.

## Strategy

1. **Union-Find Data Structure:** We'll use the Union-Find data structure to group all indices that can be swapped with each other. Each group represents indices that are inter-swappable.
2. **Sorting Groups:** Once we have groups, we'll extract the characters corresponding to these groups, sort them and place them back in the original indices to get the lexicographically smallest string.

## Code

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.root = list(range(size))
        self.rank = [1] * size

    def find(self, x):
        if x != self.root[x]:
            self.root[x] = self.find(self.root[x])
        return self.root[x]

    def union(self, x, y):
        rootX = self.find(x)
        rootY = self.find(y)

        if rootX != rootY:
            if self.rank[rootX] > self.rank[rootY]:
                self.root[rootY] = rootX
            elif self.rank[rootX] < self.rank[rootY]:
                self.root[rootX] = rootY
            else:
                self.root[rootY] = rootX
                self.rank[rootX] += 1

def smallestStringWithSwaps(s, pairs):
    n = len(s)
    union_find = UnionFind(n)
    
    for x, y in pairs:
        union_find.union(x, y)

    root_to_component = {}
    for i in range(n):
        root = union_find.find(i)
        if root not in root_to_component:
            root_to_component[root] = []
        root_to_component[root].append(i)

    smallest_string = list(s)
    for component in root_to_component.values():
        chars = [s[i] for i in component]
        chars.sort()
        for i, char in zip(sorted(component), chars):
            smallest_string[i] = char

    return ''.join(smallest_string)

# Example usage:
s = "dcab"
pairs = [[0, 3], [1, 2]]
print(smallestStringWithSwaps(s, pairs)) # Output: "bacd"
```

## Time Complexity

- **Union-Find Operations:** Union and find operations take `O(α(N))` time, where `α` is the inverse Ackermann function, which is very small (almost constant time). Hence, for `N` operations, it's effectively `O(N)`.
- **Sorting Groups:** Sorting the characters in each connected component will take `O(N log N)`, where `N` is the length of the string.
  
Overall, the time complexity is `O(N log N)` due to the sorting operation.
