title:  Count Substrings That Differ by One Character-out
permalink: /s1638
---
Given two strings `s` and `t`, find the number of substrings in `s` that differ from a substring in `t` by exactly one character. 

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Are the strings `s` and `t` guaranteed to be of certain lengths?
   - What are the allowable characters? Is it only lowercase English letters?

   *Assuming:*
   - Lengths of `s` and `t` are between 1 and 100.
   - Strings `s` and `t` contain only lowercase English letters.

2. **Output**:
   - Are we returning an integer representing the total count of such substrings?

   *Answer: Yes, we return an integer.*

### Strategy
1. **Brute-force Substring Comparison**:
   - Generate all possible substrings of `s`.
   - For each substring of `s`, generate all possible substrings of `t` of the same length.
   - Compare each pair of substrings to see if they differ by exactly one character and keep a count.

2. **Optimization**:
   - Instead of a naive comparison of all substrings, use a more efficient comparison leveraging length.

### Code
Hereâ€™s the Python code for the above strategy:

```python
def countSubstrings(s: str, t: str) -> int:
    def count_differ_by_one(s1: str, s2: str) -> int:
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(s1)):
            if s1[i] != s2[i]:
                count += 1
            if count > 1:
                return 0
        return 1 if count == 1 else 0
    
    total_count = 0
    len_s = len(s)
    len_t = len(t)
    
    for len_sub_s in range(1, len_s + 1):
        for i in range(len_s - len_sub_s + 1):
            sub_s = s[i:i + len_sub_s]
            for j in range(len_t - len_sub_s + 1):
                sub_t = t[j:j + len_sub_s]
                if count_differ_by_one(sub_s, sub_t):
                    total_count += 1
    
    return total_count
```

### Time Complexity
- **Generating Substrings**:
  - `(n(n+1))/2` substrings in `s` if `s` has length `n`.
  - The same number for `t` if `t` has length `m`.
- **Comparison**:
  - Comparing two substrings of length `k` takes `O(k)`.
  - Worst case: Generate and compare each substring from `s` with every substring in `t`. Suppose `n = m`, then it requires `O(n^2 * n^3)` which is not feasible for large `n`.

**Optimized Complexity**:
By focusing on lengths and comparisons:
- O(n^2 * m^2 * max(n, m)) which is still not very efficient but good for constraint limits (i.e., n, m <= 100).

```python
def countSubstrings(s: str, t: str) -> int:
    count = 0
    len_s, len_t = len(s), len(t)
    
    for i in range(len_s):
        for j in range(len_t):
            mismatch = 0
            for k in range(min(len_s - i, len_t - j)):
                if s[i + k] != t[j + k]:
                    mismatch += 1
                if mismatch == 1:
                    count += 1
                elif mismatch > 1:
                    break
                
    return count
```

This solution is better because it simultaneously generates and checks substrings with a greedy approach, reducing redundant substring generation and comparison.

### Summary:
This optimized approach ensures we efficiently count substrings differing by one character with `O(n^2 * m^2)` complexity, feasible within given constraints.
