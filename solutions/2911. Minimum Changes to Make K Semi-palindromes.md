title:  Minimum Changes to Make K Semi-palindromes-out
permalink: /s2911
---

The problem involves transforming a given string into multiple semi-palindromes of equal length. A semi-palindrome of length `k` is defined as a string where the first `k//2` characters match the last `k//2` characters in reverse order. The goal is to divide the given string `s` of length `n` into `n/k` substrings each of length `k` and determine the minimum number of character changes required to make each substring a semi-palindrome.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the length of the string or the value of `k`?
2. **Character Set**: Is `s` composed of lowercase English letters only?
3. **Edge Cases**: What should happen if `n` is not divisible by `k`?

### Assumptions
- The string `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
- The length of the string `n` is divisible by `k`.
- The function signature could be something like `def min_changes_to_semi_palindromes(s: str, k: int) -> int`.

### Strategy

1. **Divide the String**:
   - Split the string `s` into substrings of length `k`.
   
2. **Identify Changes for Semi-Palindrome**:
   - For each substring, check the first `k//2` and the last `k//2` characters in reverse order.
   - Calculate the number of positions where the characters differ.
   
3. **Accumulate Changes**:
   - Sum up all the character changes required for each substring.

### Time Complexity

- **Iteration over the String**: `O(n)`
- **Comparing Segments in Each Substring**: `O(k//2)`
- Total Time Complexity: `O(n)` because `k` is a divisor of `n`.

### Implementation

Here's a Python implementation of the above strategy:

```python
def min_changes_to_semi_palindromes(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    n = len(s)
    total_changes = 0
    
    for i in range(0, n, k):
        substring = s[i:i + k]
        changes = 0
        for j in range(k // 2):
            if substring[j] != substring[k - j - 1]:
                changes += 1
        total_changes += changes
    
    return total_changes

# Example usage:
s = "abcxyz" * 2  # For example purposes
k = 6
print(min_changes_to_semi_palindromes(s, k))  # Output: minimum changes required
```

### Explanation

1. **Dividing the String**: Using a loop from 0 to `n` with a step of `k`, substrings of length `k` are extracted.
2. **Calculating Changes**: For each substring, characters from the first `k//2` are compared with the corresponding characters from the last `k//2` in reverse order.
3. **Accumulating Total Changes**: The number of differences (changes needed) for each substring is accumulated and returned as the result.

This approach ensures we efficiently determine the minimum character changes required to transform the entire string into `k` semi-palindromes.
