title:  Decode the Slanted Ciphertext-out
permalink: /s2075
---

Here's the detailed problem statement for Leetcode problem 2075 (Decoded the Slanted Ciphertext):

You are given a string `encodedText` and a number of rows `rows`. The encoded text has been written in a slanted way, where each row starts one column more to the right than the previous row.

For example, if the encoded text is `"mxe aiiqaiowfonzdiox"`, and the number of rows is `3`, then this is how it is written:

```
mxe
 aii
  qaio
   wfon
    zdio
     x
```

You need to decode the string by reading left to right, top to bottom, forming the decoded text.

Write a function `decodeCiphertext(encodedText: str, rows: int) -> str` to decode the encoded text.

### Example
Input: 
```python
encodedText = "ch   ie   pr"
rows = 3
```
Output: `cipher`

**Constraints:**
- `0 <= encodedText.length <= 10^6`
- `1 <= rows <= 1000`
- `encodedText` is a valid string with spaces.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What is the maximum length of the encoded text?
2. Are there any constraints on the character set of the encoded text?
3. Should trailing spaces in the decoded text be removed?

## Strategy
1. Understand how the encoded text is formed by visualizing a matrix formation with slanted text.
2. Reconstruct the original text from the `encodedText` by:
    - Creating a list of strings to represent rows.
    - Placing characters in their appropriate positions in the matrix.
    - Reading the matrix row by row, left to right, to form the original text.
3. Remove any trailing spaces from the resulting decoded text.

## Code

Here is the Python code implementation for the decode function:

```python
def decodeCiphertext(encodedText: str, rows: int) -> str:
    # Handle edge cases
    if not encodedText or rows == 0:
        return ""
    
    cols = len(encodedText) // rows
    result = []
    
    for i in range(cols):
        for j in range(min(rows, len(encodedText) // cols)):
            index = j * cols + i + j
            if index < len(encodedText):
                result.append(encodedText[index])

    # Join and strip trailing white spaces
    plaintext = ''.join(result).rstrip()
    
    return plaintext

# Test example
print(decodeCiphertext("ch   ie   pr", 3))  # Output should be "cipher"
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the encoded text. This is because we pass through each character of the encoded text to place them into the correct positions in the decoded text formation.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), to store the resulting decoded text.

This approach ensures efficiency given the constraint `0 <= encodedText.length <= 10^6`.
