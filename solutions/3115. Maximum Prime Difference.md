title:  Maximum Prime Difference-out
permalink: /s3115
---

Given an integer array `nums`, you need to find the maximum difference between two prime numbers in the array. If there are fewer than two prime numbers in the array, return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Array Length (`len(nums)`)**: What is the maximum length of the input array? This will help in determining the feasibility of our algorithm.
2. **Element Range**: What is the range of numbers in the input array?
3. **Prime Definition**: Should we consider negative numbers, or assume all numbers are non-negative? For primes, we typically only consider positive integers greater than 1.
4. **Handling Input Edge Cases**: How should we handle an array with no prime numbers or fewer than two prime numbers?

## Strategy

1. **Identify Prime Numbers**: First, we need to identify all the prime numbers in the array.
2. **Calculate Differences**: Calculate the maximum difference between any two prime numbers identified.
3. **Return Result**: Return the maximum difference found or `-1` if there are fewer than two prime numbers.

### Steps to Implement:

1. **Prime Checking Function**: Create a helper function to check if a number is prime.
2. **Extract Primes**: Loop through the array and collect all prime numbers.
3. **Compute Maximum Difference**: If we have fewer than two primes, return `-1`, otherwise compute and return the maximum difference.

### Time Complexity

- **Prime Checking**: `O(√n)` for checking if a number `n` is a prime.
- **Extracting Primes**: `O(m * √n)` where `m` is the number of elements in `nums` and `n` is the maximum number in `nums`.

## Code

```python
def is_prime(n):
    """
    Helper function to check if a number is a prime.
    """
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    if n <= 3:
        return True
    if n % 2 == 0 or n % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= n:
        if n % i == 0 or n % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

def max_prime_difference(nums):
    """
    Function to find the maximum difference between two prime numbers in the array.
    """
    # Extract all prime numbers from the array
    primes = [num for num in nums if is_prime(num)]
    
    # If fewer than 2 primes, return -1
    if len(primes) < 2:
        return -1
    
    # Calculate and return the maximum difference between primes
    return max(primes) - min(primes)

# Example usage:
nums = [10, 7, 5, 3, 11, 17]
print(max_prime_difference(nums))  # Output should be 14 (17 - 3)
```

### Explanation

1. **is_prime function**: This uses an optimized check for primes by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number.
2. **max_prime_difference function**:
    - Extract primes from the input list `nums`.
    - Check the length of the prime list. If there are fewer than two primes, return `-1`.
    - Otherwise, calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum prime numbers and return it.

This code efficiently processes the input array to find the maximum difference between prime numbers if they exist.
