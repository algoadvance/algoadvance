title:  Find All Lonely Numbers in the Array-out
permalink: /s2150
---

You are given an integer array `nums`. A number `x` is considered **lonely** if it appears exactly once in the array, and none of its adjacent numbers (i.e., `x+1` and `x-1`) appear in the array.

Return all lonely numbers in `nums`. You may return the answer in any order.

Example:
```
Input: nums = [10,6,5,8]
Output: [10, 8]
Explanation: 
- 10 is a lonely number because it appears exactly once and 9 and 11 do not appear in the array.
- 8 is a lonely number because it appears exactly once and 7 and 9 do not appear in the array.
- 5 and 6 are not lonely numbers because they appear next to each other.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the numbers in `nums` sorted?**
   - No, the numbers can be in any arbitrary order.
2. **Can the array contain negative numbers and zero?**
   - Yes, the array can contain negative numbers, zero, and positive numbers.
3. **What is the range of values for the elements in `nums` and its length?**
   - The elements in `nums` can be within the range `[-10^9, 10^9]` and the length of the array can be up to `10^5`.

### Strategy
1. **Use a frequency dictionary**: 
   - First, count the frequency of each number in the array using a dictionary.
2. **Check for lonely numbers**:
   - Iterate through the dictionary, and for each number check if it appears exactly once.
   - Also ensure that neither `x-1` nor `x+1` exist in the dictionary.
3. **Output result**:
   - Maintain a list of all such lonely numbers and return it.

### Code
Let's implement the strategy in Python:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def findLonely(nums):
    # Step 1: Count the frequency of each number in the array
    freq = defaultdict(int)
    for num in nums:
        freq[num] += 1
    
    # Step 2: Identify lonely numbers
    lonely_numbers = []
    for num in nums:
        if freq[num] == 1 and (num - 1 not in freq) and (num + 1 not in freq):
            lonely_numbers.append(num)
    
    return lonely_numbers

# Example usage
nums = [10, 6, 5, 8]
print(findLonely(nums)) # Output: [10, 8]
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Counting Frequencies**:
   - O(n), where n is the length of the `nums` array.
2. **Checking for Lonely Numbers**:
   - O(n), iterating through the `nums` and checking conditions.
   
Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**. The space complexity is also **O(n)** due to the frequency dictionary. This ensures that the solution operates efficiently even for large input sizes.
