title:  Peaks in Array-out
permalink: /s3187
---

You are given an integer array `arr` of size `n`. A peak element in the array is an element that is greater than its neighbors. If an element is the first or the last one, it only needs to be greater than its single neighbor to be considered a peak. Write a function `findPeakElement` that returns the index of any one of the peak elements. The array may contain multiple peaks, and you are guaranteed to find a peak.

- Example:
  ```python
  Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 1]
  Output: 2 (index of element 3)
  ```
  ```python
  Input: arr = [1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 6, 4]
  Output: 1 or 5 (indexes of elements 2 or 6)
  ```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the array have duplicates?
2. Do we need to handle edge cases with very small arrays (e.g., arrays with one or two elements)?
3. Do we have any memory constraints or restrictions on the use of extra space?

### Strategy

We can efficiently solve this problem using a binary search approach. Here is the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Binary Search**: We will perform a binary search to locate a peak element. The idea is to check the middle element and determine the direction (left or right) in which a peak element lies.
2. **Comparisons**:
   - If the middle element is greater than its neighbors, it is a peak.
   - If the middle element is less than the element on the right, move the search to the right half.
   - Otherwise, move the search to the left half.

This approach ensures we find a peak in `O(log n)` time complexity.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the `findPeakElement` function:

```python
def findPeakElement(arr):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        
        if arr[mid] > arr[mid + 1]:
            # Peak is in the left half including mid
            right = mid
        else:
            # Peak is in the right half excluding mid
            left = mid + 1
    
    return left

# Example Usage
print(findPeakElement([1, 2, 3, 1]))  # Output: 2
print(findPeakElement([1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 6, 4]))  # Output: 1 or 5
```

### Time Complexity

**Time Complexity**: O(log n), as we reduce the search space by half in every iteration.

**Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.
