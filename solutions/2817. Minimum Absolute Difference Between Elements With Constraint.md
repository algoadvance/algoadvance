title:  Minimum Absolute Difference Between Elements With Constraint-out
permalink: /s2817
---
You are given a 0-indexed array `nums` and an integer `x`. Find the minimum absolute difference between any two elements in the array which satisfy the condition abs(i - j) >= x, where `i` and `j` are the indices of these elements.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Size:**
   - What are the constraints on the length of `nums` and the value of `x`?
2. **Element Range:**
   - What are the constraints on the values contained within `nums`?
3. **Indices x Constraint:**
   - Can `x` be greater than or equal to the length of `nums`?

### Example:
Suppose `nums = [1, 3, 6, 19, 20, 25]` and `x = 3`, we need to find pairs like `(1,19)`, `(3,20)`, etc. and find the minimum absolute difference among these pairs.

### Strategy:
1. **Initial Thoughts:**
   - We need to compare every pair `(i, j)` such that `abs(i - j) >= x` and find the absolute difference between the elements at these indices.
2. **Sorting for Efficiency:**
   - By sorting `nums`, we might quickly find minimal differences, but the indices constraint must still be respected.
3. **Sliding Window:**
   - Use a sliding window approach to maintain a window of sorted elements and efficiently check the condition using the constraint `x`.
4. **Two-pointer Technique:**
   - Utilize two pointers to find valid minimum differences while maintaining the constraints on indices.

### Code Implementation:

```python
def min_absolute_difference_with_constraint(nums, x):
    min_diff = float('inf')
    n = len(nums)
    
    # We need to sort indices based on the values in nums to keep track of original indices
    indexed_nums = sorted((num, i) for i, num in enumerate(nums))
    
    # Sliding window approach
    # Initialize two pointers 'left' and 'right'
    left = 0
    right = 0
    
    while right < n:
        # Keep moving the right pointer to expand the window
        while right < n and abs(indexed_nums[right][1] - indexed_nums[left][1]) < x:
            right += 1
        
        # If right is out of bounds, break the loop
        if right >= n:
            break
        
        # If the condition is satisfied, calculate the difference between current elements
        min_diff = min(min_diff, abs(indexed_nums[right][0] - indexed_nums[left][0]))
        
        # Move the left pointer to contract the window and look for new pairs
        left += 1
    
    return min_diff

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 3, 6, 19, 20, 25]
x = 3
print(min_absolute_difference_with_constraint(nums, x)) # Expected output: 14 (difference between 1 and 19)
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Sorting:** Sorting the array takes `O(n log n)`.
- **Sliding Window:** Traversing the list with two pointers takes `O(n)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, resulting in `O(n log n)`.

### Space Complexity:
- Sorting operations and the auxiliary list used for sorted elements take `O(n)` space.

This implementation ensures that we efficiently find the minimum absolute difference while respecting the index constraint.
