title:  Count Beautiful Substrings II-out
permalink: /s2949
---
You are given a string `word` consisting of lowercase English letters. You are also given a positive integer `k`. 

A substring of `word` is called **beautiful** if it can be split into exactly `k` contiguous non-empty substrings, each of which has the same set of characters.

Return the total number of beautiful substrings in `word`.

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

### Example 1:
**Input:** word = "aab", k = 2  
**Output:** 2  
**Explanation:** The word contains the following beautiful substrings: ["aa", "aab"]

### Example 2:
**Input:** word = "abcba", k = 2  
**Output:** 7  
**Explanation:** The word contains the following beautiful substrings: ["ab", "abc", "bc", "bcb", "cb", "cba", "ba"]

### Constraints:
- `1 <= word.length <= 5000`
- `word` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `1 <= k <= word.length`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can `k` be greater than the length of `word`?
   - No, `1 <= k <= word.length`.

2. Do we need to consider different substrings even if they are identical?
   - Yes, even if the substrings are identical, if they are at different positions, they should be counted separately.

3. Can the substrings overlap?
   - Yes, substrings can overlap.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we'll use the following approach:
1. Iterate through all possible starting indices of the substring in the word.
2. For each starting index, iterate through all possible ending indices forming substrings.
3. For each substring, try to divide it into `k` non-empty contiguous parts.
4. Ensure that each of these `k` parts have the same set of characters.
5. Count all valid substrings.

We need to keep in mind the constraint that the maximum possible size for the length of `word` is 5000. So we need to ensure that our algorithm is not overly time-consuming.

## Code
```python
def count_beautiful_substrings(word: str, k: int) -> int:
    def get_char_set(s):
        return set(s)
    
    n = word.length
    beautiful_count = 0
    
    # Checking for each possible substring
    for start in range(n):
        char_set = set()
        for end in range(start, n):
            char_set.add(word[end])
            
            # Current length plus 1 so k should divide this length
            if (end - start + 1) % k == 0:
                part_size = (end - start + 1) // k
                valid = True
                
                for i in range(start, end + 1, part_size):
                    if get_char_set(word[i:i + part_size]) != char_set:
                        valid = False
                        break
                
                if valid:
                    beautiful_count += 1
    
    return beautiful_count
```

## Time Complexity
Let's determine the time complexity of the above solution:
- The outer loop runs `O(n)` where `n` is the length of `word`.
- The inner loop runs `O(n)` for each iteration of the outer loop, making it `O(n^2)`.
- Checking the parts involves traversing the substring and checking each part. In the worst case, it involves `O(n)` operations for each valid part.

So, the overall time complexity is approximately `O(n^3)`, which might be a bit high but it should handle the constraint (`n <= 5000`) adequately in most cases.
