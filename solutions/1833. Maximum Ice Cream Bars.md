title:  Maximum Ice Cream Bars-out
permalink: /s1833
---
You are given an array `costs` where `costs[i]` is the price of the `i-th` ice cream bar. You have `coins` coins to spend, and you want to maximize the number of ice cream bars you can buy. 

Return the maximum number of ice cream bars you can buy with the given `coins`.

#### Example:
- **Input:** `costs = [1,3,2,4,1]`, `coins = 7`
- **Output:** `4`
- **Explanation:** You can buy the ice creams priced [1, 3, 1, 2] or [1, 1, 2, 3].

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the costs of ice cream bars always positive integers?**
   - Yes, each element in the `costs` array is a positive integer.
2. **Is the `coins` value always a non-negative integer?**
   - Yes, `coins` is a non-negative integer representing the amount of money you have.
3. **Is the array `costs` sorted?**
   - No, the array `costs` isn't necessarily sorted.

### Strategy
1. **Sort the `costs` array:** Sorting will allow us to buy the cheapest ice creams first, maximizing the number we can buy.
2. **Iterate through the sorted `costs`:** Keep a running total of the costs. 
3. **Count the ice creams:** Increment a counter each time you can afford an ice cream without exceeding the available coins.
4. **Return the count:** This counter will represent the maximum number of ice creams that can be bought.

### Code
```python
def maxIceCream(costs, coins):
    # Sort the ice cream costs in ascending order
    costs.sort()
    
    # Initialize the counter for the number of ice creams
    num_ice_creams = 0
    
    # Iterate through the sorted list and buy as many as possible
    for cost in costs:
        if coins >= cost:
            coins -= cost
            num_ice_creams += 1
        else:
            break
    
    return num_ice_creams

# Example usage:
costs = [1, 3, 2, 4, 1]
coins = 7
print(maxIceCream(costs, coins))  # Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting:** The sorting step `costs.sort()` takes `O(n log n)` time where `n` is the length of the `costs` array.
- **Iteration:** Iterating through the sorted array takes `O(n)` time.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`. This approach is efficient given the constraints typically encountered in coding interview problems.
