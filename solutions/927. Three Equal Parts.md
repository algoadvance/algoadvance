title:  Three Equal Parts-out
permalink: /s927

### Problem Statement
We are given an array `arr` consisting of only 0s and 1s. We need to find `i` and `j` such that:
1. The part `arr[0]...arr[i]`, the part `arr[i+1]...arr[j-1]`, and the part `arr[j]...arr[n-1]` are all non-empty.
2. All three parts represented as binary numbers without leading zeros are equal.

If such `i` and `j` exist, return the pair `(i, j)`. If no such `i` and `j` exist, return `[-1, -1]`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can `i` and `j` be consecutive, making one of the parts empty? 
   - No, all parts must be non-empty as per the problem constraints.

2. Is the binary number represented by the parts supposed to ignore leading zeros?
   - Yes, leading zeros should be ignored when considering the binary numbers.

3. How large is the input array?
   - This will affect the efficiency of the solution, so knowing the constraints can help optimize the approach.

### Strategy
1. **Count Total Number of 1s**: First, count the total number of 1s in the array. If this number isn't divisible by 3, return `[-1, -1]` right away since it's impossible to split them evenly.
2. **Identify Parts**: If the total number of 1s is divisible by 3, each part should contain `total_ones / 3` number of 1s.
   - Traverse the array to find the starting index of each part.
3. **Verify Parts**: Check if these three segments have identical sequences of 1s and 0s.

### Code

Here's the Python code to implement this strategy:

```python
def threeEqualParts(arr):
    # Step 1: Count the total number of 1s.
    total_ones = sum(arr)
    
    # If total_ones is not divisible by 3, return [-1, -1].
    if total_ones % 3 != 0:
        return [-1, -1]
    
    # If there are no 1s, the answer is trivially [0, len(arr) - 1]
    if total_ones == 0:
        return [0, len(arr) - 1]
    
    ones_per_part = total_ones // 3
    n = len(arr)
    
    # Finding the start positions of each part.
    first = second = third = count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if arr[i] == 1:
            count += 1
            if count == 1:
                first = i
            elif count == ones_per_part + 1:
                second = i
            elif count == 2 * ones_per_part + 1:
                third = i
    
    # Ensuring the three parts are equal.
    while third < n and arr[first] == arr[second] == arr[third]:
        first += 1
        second += 1
        third += 1
    
    # If we've reached the end, we've found a solution
    if third == n:
        return [first - 1, second]
    
    return [-1, -1]
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the array. We traverse the array several times, but each pass is O(n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), only a few extra variables are used, not proportional to the input size.

This solution is efficient given the constraints and effectively handles the problem requirements.
