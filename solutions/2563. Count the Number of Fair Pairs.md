title:  Count the Number of Fair Pairs-out
permalink: /s2563
---

Given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` of size `n` and two integers `lower` and `upper`, return the number of fair pairs. A pair `(i, j)` is fair if:

- `0 <= i < j < n`
- `lower <= nums[i] + nums[j] <= upper`

### Clarifying Questions

To ensure we fully understand the problem, here are a few clarifying questions:

1. **Range of inputs**: What are the possible ranges for `n`, `nums`, `lower`, and `upper`?
2. **Duplicates**: Can `nums` contain duplicate values?
3. **Edge Cases**: How should the function handle edge cases, such as `nums` being an empty array or containing only one element?

Once these questions are clarified, we can proceed to solving the problem.

### Strategy

1. **Sorting the Array**: First, sort the array. Sorting helps in efficiently finding pairs within a certain range using two-pointer or binary search techniques.
2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: Utilize the two-pointer technique to count pairs satisfying the condition:
   - Initiate two pointers: `i` at the start and `j` at the end.
   - Move the pointers based on the sum relative to `lower` and `upper`.
3. **Binary Search**: For each element, use binary search to find the range of elements that when added to the current element fall within [lower, upper].

This approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of valid pairs. 

### Code

Here is the Python implementation:

```python
from bisect import bisect_left, bisect_right

def count_fair_pairs(nums, lower, upper):
    nums.sort()
    count = 0
    n = len(nums)
    
    for i in range(n):
        # Finding the range of valid pairs for nums[i]
        low_bound = lower - nums[i]
        upper_bound = upper - nums[i]
        
        # Use binary search to find the bounds
        low_index = bisect_left(nums, low_bound, i + 1)  # search range starts from i + 1
        high_index = bisect_right(nums, upper_bound, i + 1) - 1
        
        if low_index < n and high_index >= i + 1:
            count += (high_index - low_index + 1)
    
    return count

# Example usage:
print(count_fair_pairs([1, 7, 9, 2, 5], 3, 10))  # Output depends on the specific problem; this is an example usage.
```

### Strategy Explanation

1. **Sorting**: We first sort the `nums` array to make the searching process easier and more efficient.
2. **Range Calculation**: For each element `nums[i]`, calculate the effective bounds `low_bound` and `upper_bound` to find valid paired elements.
3. **Binary Search**: Use the binary search to find:
   - `bisect_left` to find the smallest index where the element is greater than or equal to `low_bound`.
   - `bisect_right` to find the largest index where the element is less than or equal to `upper_bound`.
4. **Counting Valid Pairs**: Count pairs between the indices found using binary search.

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: `O(n log n)`
- **Binary Search**: For each element, binary search takes `O(log n)`, and this is done for each element => `O(n log n)`

Overall time complexity: `O(n log n) + O(n log n) = O(n log n)`

This solution is efficient for large arrays, given the constraints typically expected in competitive programming.
