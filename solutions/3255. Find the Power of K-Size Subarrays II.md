title:  Find the Power of K-Size Subarrays II-out
permalink: /s3255
---
You are given an array `nums` and an integer `k`. A subarray is a contiguous part of an array. The power of a k-size subarray is defined as follows:

- It is the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the subarray added to the sum of the elements in the subarray.

You are to find the maximum power of all k-size subarrays of the array `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the input array contain negative numbers?**
    - Yes, the input array can contain negative, zero, and positive integers.
  
2. **What are the constraints on the size of the array and the value of k?**
    - Typical constraints might be:
        - \( 1 \leq \text{len(nums)} \leq 10^5 \)
        - \( 1 \leq k \leq \text{len(nums)} \)

3. **Is it always guaranteed that k will be less than or equal to the length of the array?**
    - Yes, it is guaranteed.

### Strategy
1. **Sliding Window**: Use a sliding window of size `k` to traverse the array and find subarrays.
2. **Deque for Maximum and Minimum**: Use two deques to keep track of the maximum and minimum elements in the current sliding window.
3. **Compute Power**: For each window position, compute the power and keep track of the maximum power encountered.

### Code
```python
from collections import deque

def find_max_power(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    if k > n:
        return 0
    
    # Deques to maintain max and min of the current window
    max_deque = deque()
    min_deque = deque()
    
    def clean_deque(deque, idx, comparison):
        if deque and deque[0] == idx - k:
            deque.popleft()
        while deque and comparison(nums[deque[-1]], nums[idx]):
            deque.pop()
    
    max_power = float('-inf')
    window_sum = sum(nums[:k])
    
    for i in range(k):
        clean_deque(max_deque, i, lambda x, y: x <= y)
        clean_deque(min_deque, i, lambda x, y: x >= y)
        max_deque.append(i)
        min_deque.append(i)
    
    max_power = max(max_power, window_sum + (nums[max_deque[0]] - nums[min_deque[0]]))
    
    for i in range(k, n):
        clean_deque(max_deque, i, lambda x, y: x <= y)
        clean_deque(min_deque, i, lambda x, y: x >= y)
        
        max_deque.append(i)
        min_deque.append(i)
        
        window_sum += nums[i] - nums[i - k]
        current_power = window_sum + (nums[max_deque[0]] - nums[min_deque[0]])
        max_power = max(max_power, current_power)
    
    return max_power

# Example usage
nums = [1, 5, 2, 3, 7]
k = 3
print(find_max_power(nums, k))  # Output will depend on specific values
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization of sums and deques:** \(O(k)\)
- **Sliding window traversal:** \(O(n)\)
- **Maintaining deques for max and min:** Amortized \(O(1)\) per operation.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, making this approach efficient for large arrays up to \(10^5\) elements.
