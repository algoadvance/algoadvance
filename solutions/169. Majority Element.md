title:  Majority Element-out
permalink: /s169
---
Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

### Example:
```python
Input: nums = [3,2,3]
Output: 3

Input: nums = [2,2,1,1,1,2,2]
Output: 2
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Q**: Can the array be empty?  
   **A**: No, you may assume that the array is non-empty and a majority element always exists.

2. **Q**: Is the array always of integer type?  
   **A**: Yes, the array is always comprised of integers.

3. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the input size?  
   **A**: The problem doesn't specify constraints but typical constraints can be expected like `n <= 10^5`.

### Strategy:
We'll use the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm for this problem due to its efficiency. The algorithm works in two phases:
1. **Finding a Candidate**: We iterate through the array and maintain a count of the potential candidate for the majority element.
2. **Verification** (optional in this context): Since the problem states that a majority element always exists, this step can generally be skipped. However, let's mention how it would work for completeness: in this step, we'd confirm if the candidate is actually the majority element by counting its occurrences.

#### Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm:
- Initialize a candidate as `None` and a `count` as `0`.
- Traverse through the array:
  - If `count` is `0`, set `candidate` to the current element.
  - If the current element is the same as `candidate`, increment `count`.
  - If the current element is different from `candidate`, decrement `count`.
- The candidate at the end of the traversal is the majority element.

### Code:
Here's the implementation of the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm in Python:

```python
def majorityElement(nums):
    candidate = None
    count = 0

    for num in nums:
        if count == 0:
            candidate = num
            count = 1
        elif num == candidate:
            count += 1
        else:
            count -= 1

    return candidate
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array. We only pass through the list once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), this algorithm uses constant extra space.

This provides an efficient and effective solution to finding the majority element in the array.
