title:  Diagonal Traverse II-out
permalink: /s1424
---

Given a list of lists of integers `nums`, return all elements of `nums` in diagonal order as described in the example below.

**Example:**

```
Input: 
nums = [
 [1,2,3],
 [4,5,6],
 [7,8,9]
]
Output: [1,4,2,7,5,3,8,6,9]
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i].length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i][j] <= 10^9`
- There are at most `10^5` elements in `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:** Are we guaranteed that the input list of lists will be non-empty?
   - Yes, based on the constraints `1 <= nums.length`.
   
2. **Output Format:** Should the output be a list containing the elements in diagonal order?
   - Yes, return the elements of `nums` in the required diagonal order.

3. **Diagonal Order:** Do we start from the top-left element and proceed diagonally down-right?
   - Yes, the elements should be traversed and collected in a diagonal manner as given in the example.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we need to traverse the list of lists `nums` and collect elements in a diagonal order. We can achieve this by:
1. Using a hash map (`diagonals`) where the keys are the sums of the indices (i + j) and the values are lists of elements.
2. We can traverse the `nums` matrix, and for each element `nums[i][j]`, put it in the corresponding list in the hash map with key `i + j`.
3. Finally, we combine all the values from the hash map in the order of the keys to get the required result.

**Detailed Steps:**
1. Initialize an empty dictionary `diagonals`.
2. Traverse the `nums` matrix.
3. For each element `nums[i][j]`, append it to `diagonals[i + j]`.
4. Initialize an empty result list.
5. Iterate over the keys in sorted order of the hash map.
6. Append each list of elements to the result list in the order of the keys.

### Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def findDiagonalOrder(nums):
    diagonals = defaultdict(list)

    # Populate the dictionary with elements according to their diagonals
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(len(nums[i])):
            diagonals[i + j].append(nums[i][j])
    
    # Prepare the result list
    result = []
    
    # Concatenate lists in the order of their diagonal sums
    for k in sorted(diagonals.keys()):
        result.extend(diagonals[k])
        
    return result

# Example
nums = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
print(findDiagonalOrder(nums))  # Output: [1, 4, 2, 7, 5, 3, 8, 6, 9]
```

### Time Complexity

- Traversing the entire `nums` list of lists takes `O(N)`, where `N` is the total number of elements in `nums`.
- The space complexity is also `O(N)` due to storing elements in the hash map and result list.

Thus, the approach is efficient and should work well within the problem constraints.
