LeetCode Problem 229: **Majority Element II**

Given an integer array `nums` of size `n`, find all elements that appear more than `⌊ n / 3 ⌋` times. You must do this in `O(n)` time and `O(1)` space.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What should be returned if no elements meet the condition?
   **A:** An empty list should be returned.

2. **Q:** Can the input array contain negative numbers?
   **A:** Yes, the integers can be negative.

3. **Q:** Should the results be returned in any specific order?
   **A:** No specific order is required for the results.

### Strategy
This problem can be effectively solved using the **Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm** for finding multiple majority elements. The algorithm is based on the idea of maintaining counters for potential majority elements and then validating those candidates.

#### Steps:
1. **Identify Potential Candidates:**
   - We initialize two candidate variables and their respective counters.
   - Traverse through the array and update these candidates and counters based on the element being processed.

2. **Count and Verify:**
   - After identifying potential candidates, count their occurrences to verify if they appear more than `⌊ n / 3 ⌋` times.

### Code

```python
def majorityElement(nums):
    if not nums:
        return []
    
    # Step 1: Find candidates
    candidate1, candidate2, count1, count2 = None, None, 0, 0
    
    for num in nums:
        if candidate1 == num:
            count1 += 1
        elif candidate2 == num:
            count2 += 1
        elif count1 == 0:
            candidate1, count1 = num, 1
        elif count2 == 0:
            candidate2, count2 = num, 1
        else:
            count1 -= 1
            count2 -= 1
    
    # Step 2: Verify candidates
    result = []
    count1, count2 = 0, 0
    
    for num in nums:
        if num == candidate1:
            count1 += 1
        elif num == candidate2:
            count2 += 1
    
    n = len(nums)
    if count1 > n // 3:
        result.append(candidate1)
    if count2 > n // 3:
        result.append(candidate2)
    
    return result

# Example Usage
nums = [3,2,3]
print(majorityElement(nums))  # Output: [3]
nums = [1,1,1,3,3,2,2,2]
print(majorityElement(nums))  # Output: [1, 2]
```

### Time Complexity
The algorithm requires two passes over the input array:
- The first pass to identify potential candidates.
- The second pass to verify the counts of these candidates.

Thus, the time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array, as required by the problem statement.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is `O(1)` because we are only using a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.
