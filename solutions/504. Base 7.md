Given an integer `num`, return a string representing its base 7 representation.

Example 1:
```
Input: num = 100
Output: "202"
```

Example 2:
```
Input: num = -7
Output: "-10"
```

Constraints:
- `-10^7 <= num <= 10^7`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input number be negative?**
   - Yes, the example indicates that the input number can be negative.

2. **Should the output always be in string format?**
   - Yes, the problem statement specifies that the output should be a string representing the base-7 number.

3. **Are there any special cases we need to handle, such as zero?**
   - Yes, if the input is zero, we should handle it specifically as its base-7 representation is also "0".

## Strategy

1. **Handle special Case:**
   - If the input `num` is zero, simply return the string "0".
   
2. **Determine Sign:**
   - Check if the number is negative. If so, keep track of the sign and work with the absolute value of the number.
   
3. **Convert to Base 7:**
   - Continuously divide the number by 7 and keep track of the remainder.
   - Append remainders to the result string, but build it in reverse order (from least significant digit to most significant digit).

4. **Add Sign Back:**
   - If the original number was negative, add a negative sign to the final base-7 string.

5. **Return the Result:**
   - Return the resulting base-7 string.

## Code

```python
def convertToBase7(num: int) -> str:
    if num == 0:
        return "0"

    negative = num < 0
    num = abs(num)

    digits = []

    while num > 0:
        digits.append(str(num % 7))
        num //= 7

    if negative:
        digits.append('-')

    return ''.join(digits[::-1])

# Example Test Cases
print(convertToBase7(100))  # Output: "202"
print(convertToBase7(-7))   # Output: "-10"
print(convertToBase7(0))    # Output: "0"
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is **O(log_7(n))** since we repeatedly divide the number by 7.
- The space complexity is also **O(log_7(n))** due to storing the digits of the base-7 representation in a list.

With this approach, we efficiently and correctly convert any integer within the given range to its base-7 representation.
