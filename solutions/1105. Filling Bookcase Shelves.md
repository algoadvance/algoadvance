title:  Filling Bookcase Shelves-out

You are given a 2D list `books` where each `books[i] = [thickness(i), height(i)]` represents a book with the thickness of `thickness(i)` and height `height(i)`. We are also given an integer shelfWidth which represents the width of a shelf. 

We want to place all the books in a single shelf with a height such that the total height of the bookshelf is minimized.

We can place books on multiple shelves, but the width of books on any single shelf should not exceed `shelfWidth`. The total height of the bookshelf is the sum of the height of each shelf.

Write a function `minHeightShelves(books, shelfWidth)` that returns the minimum height of the bookshelf.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Books Order:** Do we need to keep the relative order of books?
   - Yes, the order of books should be maintained as given.
   
2. **Is there a limit to the number of books?**
   - No, there is no stated limit, so the solution should work for any reasonable input size.

3. **Are the dimensions of the books (thickness and height) positive integers?**
   - Yes, both thickness and height are positive integers.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will use Dynamic Programming (DP). We will define `dp[i]` as the minimum height of the bookshelf to place the first `i` books.

**Steps:**

1. **DP Array Initialization:** Initialize a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum height for the first `i` books. Start with `dp[0] = 0` because if there are no books, the height is zero.
2. **DP Update:** Iterate through the books and for each book, try to place it on the current shelf or move it to a new shelf. Update the DP value by considering the minimum height from previously computed states.
3. **Iterate through each book** and at each step compute the height by considering placing the book on a new shelf or with current shelves.

### Code Implementation

```python
def minHeightShelves(books, shelfWidth):
    n = len(books)
    dp = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 0
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        width = 0
        height = 0
        # Start placing the current book alone on a new shelf
        for j in range(i, 0, -1):
            width += books[j-1][0]
            if width > shelfWidth:
                break
            height = max(height, books[j-1][1])
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j-1] + height)
    
    return dp[n]

# Example usage
books = [[1, 3], [2, 4], [3, 2]]
shelfWidth = 6
print(minHeightShelves(books, shelfWidth))  # Output should be 4
```

### Time Complexity

- **Outer Loop:** Runs `n` times for each book.
- **Inner Loop:** In the worst case, can also run `n` times for checking the width constraints.

Thus, the time complexity is \(O(n^2)\), where `n` is the number of books.

- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the DP array used.
