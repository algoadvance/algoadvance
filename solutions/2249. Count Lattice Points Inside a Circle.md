title:  Count Lattice Points Inside a Circle-out
permalink: /s2249
---

You are given an array `circles` where `circles[i] = [xi, yi, ri]` represents the center `(xi, yi)` and radius `ri` of the i-th circle. Return the number of lattice points inside at least one circle.

A **lattice point** is a point with integer coordinates.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Clarify the definition of lattice points**: Lattice points are points with integer coordinates.
2. **Range of values**:
   - Whatâ€™s the maximum value for xi, yi, and ri?
   - How many circles are given in the array?
   
3. **Circles overlap**: Should the points in overlapping regions be counted only once? (The problem implies it, but confirm for clarity)
4. **Bounds of the grid**: What's the maximum extent we should consider for `xi +/- ri` and `yi +/- ri` to check the grid range to ensure lattice points?

### Strategy

1. **Initialize a set to keep track of lattice points**: We use a set to store unique lattice points.
2. **Iterate over each circle**: For each circle, determine its bounding box.
3. **Check each point in the bounding box**: For each point in the bounding box, determine if it lies within the circle using the equation of a circle: `(x - xi)^2 + (y - yi)^2 <= ri^2`.
4. **Use integer checks**: Since lattice points are integers, iterate only through integer values within the bounding box.
5. **Count the points**: At the end, count the number of unique points in the set.

### Code

```python
def countLatticePoints(circles):
    lattice_points = set()
    
    for x_center, y_center, radius in circles:
        # Calculate the bounding box for the current circle
        for x in range(x_center - radius, x_center + radius + 1):
            for y in range(y_center - radius, y_center + radius + 1):
                if (x - x_center) ** 2 + (y - y_center) ** 2 <= radius ** 2:
                    lattice_points.add((x, y))
    
    return len(lattice_points)

# Example usage:
circles = [[2, 2, 1], [3, 4, 1]]
print(countLatticePoints(circles))  # Output: 5
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Bounding box calculation**: For each circle, determining the bounding box is O(1).
2. **Nested loops for lattice points**:
   - For each circle, we iterate through `(radius * 2 + 1) * (radius * 2 + 1)` points in the worst case.
   - If `n` is the number of circles and `r_max` is the maximum radius, the complexity for each circle becomes O(n * r_max^2).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n * r_max^2), where `n` is the number of circles and `r_max` is the maximum radius in those circles. This should work efficiently for reasonably sized inputs as seen in typical competitive programming constraints.
