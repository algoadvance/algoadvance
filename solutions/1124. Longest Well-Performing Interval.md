title:  Longest Well-Performing Interval-out
permalink: /s1124
---

You are given an integer array `hours` that represents the number of hours worked each day. A day is considered a "tiring day" if the number of hours worked is more than 8, and a "non-tiring day" if the number of hours worked is 8 or less.

A "well-performing interval" is defined as an interval `[i, j]` where the number of tiring days is strictly greater than the number of non-tiring days within that interval. Return the length of the longest well-performing interval.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain negative hours?**
   - No, the hours are all non-negative integers as they represent hours worked.

2. **What should be returned if there is no well-performing interval?**
   - If there is no such interval where tiring days are more than non-tiring days, the return value should be `0`.

3. **What is the range of the length of the array?**
   - The length can be up to `10^4`.

### Strategy

To solve the problem efficiently, we will utilize a prefix sum and a hash map:

1. **Transform the Array:**
   - Convert the array such that each element is `1` if the hours are greater than `8` (tiring day) and `-1` otherwise (non-tiring day).

2. **Prefix Sum and Hash Map:**
   - Calculate the prefix sum for the transformed array.
   - Use a hash map to store the first occurrence of each prefix sum.

3. **Identify the Longest Interval:**
   - Iterate through the modified array while maintaining the prefix sum.
   - Keep track of the longest interval where the prefix sum at the current index minus the prefix sum at an earlier index is greater than 0.

### Code

```python
def longest_wpi(hours):
    # Step 1: Transform the hours array
    transformed = [1 if hour > 8 else -1 for hour in hours]
    
    # Step 2: Initialize variables
    prefix_sum = 0
    longest_interval = 0
    prefix_map = {}  # This will store the first occurrence of each prefix sum
    
    # Step 3: Iterate over the transformed array
    for i, val in enumerate(transformed):
        # Update the prefix sum
        prefix_sum += val
        
        # If prefix sum is positive, it means from the start to current index is a valid interval
        if prefix_sum > 0:
            longest_interval = i + 1
        
        # If prefix sum <= 0, check if there have been previous occurrences
        if prefix_sum <= 0:
            if (prefix_sum - 1) in prefix_map:
                longest_interval = max(longest_interval, i - prefix_map[prefix_sum - 1])
        
        # Store only the first occurrence of each prefix sum
        if prefix_sum not in prefix_map:
            prefix_map[prefix_sum] = i
    
    return longest_interval

# Example test
hours = [9, 9, 6, 0, 6, 6, 9]
print(longest_wpi(hours))  # Output should be 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the hours array. We are iterating over the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), due to the space required to store the prefix sums in the hash map.

By transforming the array and using a prefix sum with hash map, this solution efficiently finds the longest well-performing interval.
