title:  Divide Array Into Arrays With Max Difference-out
permalink: /s2966
---

You are given an array `nums` of `n` integers. You want to divide this array into as many subarrays as possible such that the difference between the maximum and minimum element in each subarray is at most `k`. Find the number of such subarrays you can create.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the subarrays overlap?
   - No, each element must belong to exactly one subarray, and subarrays are non-overlapping.

2. What should be returned if it is impossible to create any valid subarray?
   - You should return the minimum number of subarrays that can be created while satisfying the condition where the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in each subarray is at most `k`.

3. What is the range of the values in `nums`?
   - The values in `nums` are integers and the length of nums can be upto 10^5.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Array**: Start by sorting the array. This ensures that for any element `i`, all the differences between consecutive elements to its right are non-decreasing.
2. **Sliding Window Method**: Use a sliding window approach to group elements. The key idea is to extend the window as long as the difference between the minimum and maximum elements (first and last in the sorted window) is less than or equal to `k`.
3. **Track Subarrays**: Every time the window does not satisfy the condition, count the current window as a valid subarray and start a new one.
4. **Final Subarray**: Ensure to count the last window as a valid subarray if it satisfies the condition.

### Code

```python
def maxNumOfSubarrays(nums, k):
    # Sort the array
    nums.sort()

    # Initialize pointers and counters
    start = 0
    count = 0

    for end in range(len(nums)):
        # Check if the current window satisfies the condition
        if nums[end] - nums[start] > k:
            # If not, increment the count and move start to end
            count += 1
            start = end
    
    # Add the last window if valid
    if start < len(nums):
        count += 1
    
    return count

# Test cases
print(maxNumOfSubarrays([1, 3, 6, 10, 15], 5))  # Output: 3
print(maxNumOfSubarrays([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 3))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: `O(n log n)`
- **Sliding Window Traversal**: `O(n)`

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n) + O(n) = O(n log n)`.

This approach ensures an efficient solution to dividing the array into maximum possible subarrays where the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in each subarray is at most `k`.
