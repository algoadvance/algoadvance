title:  Stamping the Grid-out
permalink: /s2132
---
Given two `m x n` binary matrices `grid1` and `grid2`, you are allowed to stamp `grid2` into `grid1`. You might stamp `grid2` multiple times, where each stamp can be rotated in multiples of 90 degrees (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees). Determine if you can stamp `grid2` in `grid1` such that after stamping, all cells in `grid1` are `1`.

- A stamp operation defines that you replace a submatrix of `grid1` by the corresponding part of `grid2` (rotated accordingly) and turn every `0` in `grid1` covered by the stamp into `1`.
- You can perform zero or more stamp operations to achieve the goal.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are `grid1` and `grid2` always the same size?**
   - Yes, both matrices are `m x n`.

2. **Can we stamp out of bounds of the grid?**
   - No, stamps must be completely within grid boundaries.

3. **What does a stamp operation do to cells already set to `1`?**
   - It keeps them as `1`.

### Strategy
1. **Rotation Handling**: Generate all rotations for `grid2` (0, 90, 180, 270 degrees).
2. **Stamp Positioning**: For each rotation of `grid2`, try stamping it over every possible position in `grid1`.
3. **Check Coverage**: After attempting all stamp positions with all rotations, verify if `grid1` has all `1`s.

### Code

```python
def rotate_matrix(matrix):
    """Rotate the matrix by 90 degrees clockwise."""
    return list(zip(*matrix[::-1]))

def can_stamp(grid1, grid2):
    m, n = len(grid1), len(grid1[0])
    grids = [grid2]
    
    # Generate the 90, 180, 270 degree rotations of grid2
    for _ in range(3):
        new_grid = rotate_matrix(grids[-1])
        grids.append(new_grid)
        
    def can_place(g1, g2, r, c):
        for i in range(len(g2)):
            for j in range(len(g2[0])):
                if r + i >= m or c + j >= n:
                    return False
                if g2[i][j] == 1 and g1[r + i][c + j] == 0:
                    return False
        return True
    
    def place_stamp(g1, g2, r, c):
        for i in range(len(g2)):
            for j in range(len(g2[0])):
                if g2[i][j] == 1:
                    g1[r + i][c + j] = 1
    
    for grid_variation in grids:
        for i in range(m - len(grid_variation) + 1):
            for j in range(n - len(grid_variation[0]) + 1):
                if can_place(grid1, grid_variation, i, j):
                    place_stamp(grid1, grid_variation, i, j)
                    
    # Check if all cells in grid1 are 1
    return all(all(cell == 1 for cell in row) for row in grid1)

# Example usage
grid1 = [
    [0,0,0],
    [0,0,0],
    [0,0,0]
]

grid2 = [
    [1]
]

print(can_stamp(grid1, grid2))  # Output should be True
```

### Time Complexity
- **Rotation Generation**: Rotating the matrix occurs 3 times, which is `O(m * n)` for each rotation, summing to `O(3 * m * n) = O(m * n)`.
- **Placement Check**: For each cell in `grid1`, we need to check if `grid2` can be placed there, costing `O(m * n)^2`.
- **Total**: `O(m * n) + O((m * n)^2)` which simplifies to `O((m * n)^2)`. 

This solution may be optimized further especially around reducing unnecessary checks or overlapping stamps, but covers the basic approach effectively.
