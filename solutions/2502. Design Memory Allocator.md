title:  Design Memory Allocator-out
permalink: /s2502
---

Let's design a memory allocation system with a contiguous memory array of a given size. Implement a class `Allocator` that supports the following operations:

1. **Constructor**: 
   `Allocator(int n)` - Initializes an allocator with a block of `n` memory slots (each slot is initially free).

2. **Allocate**:
   `int allocate(int size, int mID)` - Attempts to allocate a contiguous block of `size` memory slots and assign them the `mID`. Returns the start index if the allocation is successful or -1 if it fails.

3. **Free**:
   `int free(int mID)` - Frees all memory slots with the given `mID` and returns the number of slots freed.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints**:
   - What is the maximum size of the memory array?
   - Can multiple allocations exist for the same `mID`?
   - Should we be concerned about memory fragmentation and defragmentation?
  
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - What should happen if I try to allocate more memory than available?
   - Are memory slots guaranteed to be queried with valid indices?

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - We'll use a list to represent the memory slots initialized to 0s, indicating free slots.

2. **Allocate**:
   - Traverse the memory list to find a contiguous block of free slots of the required size.
   - If such a block is found, mark the slots with the provided `mID` and return the starting index.
   - If no such block exists, return -1.

3. **Free**:
   - Traverse the memory list and reset any slot with the given `mID` to 0.
   - Count and return the number of slots freed.

## Code Implementation

```python
class Allocator:
    def __init__(self, n: int):
        self.memory = [0] * n

    def allocate(self, size: int, mID: int) -> int:
        length = len(self.memory)
        for i in range(length - size + 1):
            # Check if we have a contiguous block of the required size
            if all(self.memory[j] == 0 for j in range(i, i + size)):
                for j in range(i, i + size):
                    self.memory[j] = mID
                return i
        return -1

    def free(self, mID: int) -> int:
        count = 0
        for i in range(len(self.memory)):
            if self.memory[i] == mID:
                self.memory[i] = 0
                count += 1
        return count

# Example usage:
# allocator = Allocator(10)
# print(allocator.allocate(1, 1)) # Output: 0
# print(allocator.allocate(1, 2)) # Output: 1
# print(allocator.allocate(1, 3)) # Output: 2
# print(allocator.free(2))        # Output: 1
# print(allocator.allocate(3, 4)) # Output: 1
# print(allocator.allocate(1, 1)) # Output: 0
# print(allocator.free(1))        # Output: 2
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Constructor**: `O(n)` where `n` is the size of the memory array.
2. **Allocate**: `O(n * size)` in the worst case when it needs to check all slots for the contiguous block.
3. **Free**: `O(n)` as it needs to traverse the list to reset the slots with the given `mID`.
