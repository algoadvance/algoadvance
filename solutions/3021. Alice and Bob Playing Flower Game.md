title:  Alice and Bob Playing Flower Game-out
permalink: /s3021
---

Alice and Bob are playing a game with a row of flowers, where:

- Each flower has a certain number of petals.
- Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice going first.

On each player's turn, they can pick any single flower, but they can only pick a flower with an odd number of petals. Once a flower is picked, it is removed from the row. The game ends when there are no flowers with an odd number of petals left. The player who cannot make a move loses the game.

Write a function to determine who will win if both play optimally.

### Parameters:
- `petals` is a list of integers representing the number of petals on each flower.

### Returns:
- The function should return the name of the winner, either `Alice` or `Bob`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are negative numbers or zero petals possible in the input list?
2. If there are no odd petals initially, who is considered the winner?
3. Are there any constraints on the size of the list or the values of the petals?

## Strategy
1. Count the total number of flowers with odd petals.
2. If there are an odd number of flowers with odd petals, Alice, who starts first, will always have the last pick and hence will win.
3. If there are an even number of flowers with odd petals, Bob will have the last pick because he will always be able to follow Aliceâ€™s turn.

## Code

```python
def flower_game(petals):
    odd_flowers_count = sum(1 for petal in petals if petal % 2 != 0)
    if odd_flowers_count % 2 == 1:
        return "Alice"
    else:
        return "Bob"

# Example usage:
# petals = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
# print(flower_game(petals))  # Output: "Alice"
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the number of elements in the `petals` list. This is because we iterate through the list once to count the number of flowers with odd petals.

Would you like to provide a set of test cases or any additional constraints?
