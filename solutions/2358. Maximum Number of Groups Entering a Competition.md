title:  Maximum Number of Groups Entering a Competition-out
permalink: /s2358
---

You are given an array of positive integers `grades` which represents the grades of students in a competition. You want to partition the students into the maximum number of groups such that:

1. Each student is in exactly one group.
2. Each group has more students than the previous group.

Return the maximum number of groups you can form.

Example:
```
Input: grades = [3, 6, 1, 4, 2]
Output: 3
Explanation: For example, we can form [ [1], [2, 3], [4, 6] ]. The groups are [1], [2, 3], and [4, 6], and each group has more students than the previous group.
```

## Clarifying Questions

Before proceeding with the solution, it's crucial to confirm a few points:
1. Can grades have duplicates?
2. Is there any maximum limit for the size of the `grades` array?

## Strategy

The problem can be approached using a greedy strategy. The main idea is to continually form groups with incrementally increasing size until it's no longer possible to do so.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Sort the Grades:** While sorting the grades isn't strictly necessary for calculating the maximum number of groups, it can help in understanding and visualizing the problem. However, the main focus will be on the counts and not the values.
2. **Initialize Counters:** Use counters to keep track of the current group size and the number of groups formed so far.
3. **Iterate and Form Groups:** Use a loop to continuously form groups with increasing size (starting from 1). Keep track of the sum of students/elements required for the groups.
4. **Check Feasibility:** In each step, check if enough students are left to form the next group. If not, break.

This is an iterative method that ensures we can determine the maximum number of groups.

## Code

Here's how you can implement this in Python:

```python
def maxGroups(grades):
    grades.sort() # Sorting for visualization, not strictly necessary for count calculation.
    n = len(grades)
    groups = 0
    required_students = 0
    
    while required_students <= n:
        groups += 1
        required_students += groups
        if required_students > n:
            break
    
    return groups - 1

# Example usage:
grades = [3, 6, 1, 4, 2]
print(maxGroups(grades)) # Output: 3
```

## Explanation

1. **Initialization:** We start with `groups` set to 0 and `required_students` that represents the cumulative sum of students needed for an increasing number of groups.
2. **Looping and Incrementing:** We continue adding one more group size incrementally:
    - `groups` keeps track of the number of groups we are forming.
    - `required_students` is the cumulative number of students needed to form these groups.
3. **Breaking Condition:** If at any point `required_students` exceeds the total number of students `n`, we break the loop and return the last count of valid groups (`groups - 1`).

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(n log n) due to the initial sorting step. The loop heuristic runs in O(âˆšn), as it involves summation steps to approximate the groups, but this is dominated by the sorting step in practical scenarios.

This ensures that the solution is efficient and handles the problem constraints effectively.
