title:  New 21 Game-out

Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".

Alice starts with `0` points, and draws numbers while her total is less than `K`. Each draw is an integer number between `1` and `W` (inclusive), where each draw is equally likely to be any of these integer numbers. Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets `K` or more points. 

Return the probability that Alice's score is less than or equal to `N` (that is, `N` or less) when she stops drawing.

Example 1:
```
Input: N = 10, K = 1, W = 10
Output: 1.00000
Explanation: Alice gets a single card, then stops.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: N = 6, K = 1, W = 10
Output: 0.60000
Explanation: Alice gets a single card, then stops.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: N = 21, K = 17, W = 10
Output: 0.73278
```

Note:
- `0 <= K <= N <= 10000`
- `1 <= W <= 10000`
- Answers will be accepted as correct if they are within `10^-5` of the correct answer.
- The inputs are such that `K + W` is at most `10000`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What happens if `K` is zero? 
   - If `K` is zero, Alice canâ€™t draw any card and thus will have 0 points, so the probability would be `1` if `N >= 0`, else `0`.
   
2. What if `N` is less than `K`?
   - If `N` is less than `K`, Alice will stop before reaching or exceeding `K`, so it's certain Alice's score will be less than or equal to `N`.

With these clarifications, we can move forward to devise the strategy.

## Strategy
We'll use Dynamic Programming (DP) to solve this problem. Let `dp[x]` represent the probability that Alice gets `x` points. We'll construct `dp` array with the following considerations:

1. Initialize `dp[0]` to `1` (100% chance Alice starts at 0 points).
2. Iterate over `x` from `1` to `N`. Calculate `dp[x]` as the sum of `dp[x-1]` to `dp[x-W]` divided by `W`.
3. Sum up the probabilities for points greater or equal to `K` but less than or equal to `N`.

### Code
```python
def new21Game(N: int, K: int, W: int) -> float:
    if K == 0 or N >= K + W:
        return 1.0

    dp = [0.0] * (N + 1)
    dp[0] = 1.0

    window_sum = 1.0
    result = 0.0
    for i in range(1, N + 1):
        dp[i] = window_sum / W
        if i < K:
            window_sum += dp[i]
        else:
            result += dp[i]
        if i - W >= 0:
            window_sum -= dp[i - W]
    
    return result

# Test example
print(new21Game(10, 1, 10)) # Output should be 1.00000
print(new21Game(6, 1, 10))  # Output should be 0.60000
print(new21Game(21, 17, 10))# Output should be 0.73278
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity is `O(N)`, as we iterate through the range from `1` to `N` once, and within each iteration, updating the window_sum takes `O(1)` time. Therefore, our solution is efficient and should handle the input constraints effectively.
