title:  Number of Closed Islands-out
permalink: /s1254
---
Given a 2D grid consists of 0s (land) and 1s (water). An island is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of 0s and a closed island is an island totally (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by 1s.

Return the number of closed islands.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What is the size range of the grid?**
   - The size of the grid can vary; typically constraints might range up to 100x100.

2. **Are disconnected islands treated as individual islands?**
   - Yes, disconnected groups of 0s are treated as individual islands.

3. **Is the entire grid guaranteed to be either 0 or 1?**
   - Yes, each cell in the grid is either 0 or 1.

### Strategy:
1. **Identify Boundary Islands:**
   - Iterate over the boundary cells of the grid, and mark any connected group of 0s (using DFS or BFS) starting from these boundary cells. This is done to identify and exclude islands that are not closed islands (since they touch the boundary).

2. **Count Closed Islands:**
   - Perform another iteration over the whole grid to count all the remaining islands that 0s form. An island is counted towards the result only if it is found to be entirely surrounded by 1s.

3. **Depth-First Search (DFS):**
   - Use DFS to traverse through the islands. Change the visited land (0s) to another value (say 2) to avoid revisiting.

### Code:
```python
def closedIsland(grid):
    def dfs(x, y):
        if x < 0 or x >= rows or y < 0 or y >= cols:
            return
        if grid[x][y] != 0:
            return
        grid[x][y] = 2  # Mark the cell as visited
        # Explore all 4 directions
        dfs(x + 1, y)
        dfs(x - 1, y)
        dfs(x, y + 1)
        dfs(x, y - 1)

    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])

    # Mark boundary islands
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in [0, cols - 1]:
            if grid[i][j] == 0:
                dfs(i, j)
    for i in [0, rows - 1]:
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 0:
                dfs(i, j)

    # Count closed islands
    closed_islands = 0
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 0:
                closed_islands += 1
                dfs(i, j)

    return closed_islands
```

### Time Complexity:
- The traversal of the grid using DFS ensures that each cell is visited exactly once. 
- Therefore, the time complexity is O(M * N), where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns in the grid.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is O(M * N) in case all land cells are connected (because the call stack for DFS could go as deep as the number of land cells in a worst-case scenario). However, typically it is less due to regular call stack space used based on the island sizes.
