The **H-Index** is a metric used to measure the productivity and citation impact of the publications of a scientist or scholar. The definition of the H-Index is as follows:

Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `i-th` paper, the H-Index is calculated as follows:

A scientist has an index `h` if `h` of their `n` papers have at least `h` citations each, and the other `n âˆ’ h` papers have no more than `h` citations each.

We need to write a function `hIndex` to compute the H-Index.

Example 1:
```
Input: citations = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5]
Output: 3
Explanation: [3, 0, 6, 1, 5] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 3, 0, 6, 1, 5 citations respectively. 
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: citations = [1, 3, 1]
Output: 1
```

Constraints:
- `n == citations.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5000`
- `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are negative citation counts permissible?**
   - No, as per the problem constraints, citation counts are non-negative.

2. **Can there be duplicate citation counts?**
   - Yes, citation counts for multiple papers can be the same.

## Strategy

To determine the H-Index:
1. **Sort**: First, sort the array `citations` in non-decreasing order.
2. **Iterate and Check**: Traverse the sorted list from the largest value to the smallest. During the iteration:
   - For each paper at index `i` in the sorted list, check if the number of papers with citation count greater than or equal to the current citation count (which is `n - i` where `n` is the length of the sorted list) is at least as large as the number of papers.
   - The H-Index corresponds to the maximum value where this condition holds true.

This approach ensures we correctly identify the maximum H-Index by verifying the criteria against the sorted list.

## Code

```python
def hIndex(citations):
    citations.sort(reverse=True)
    h_index = 0
    for i, c in enumerate(citations):
        if c >= i + 1:
            h_index = i + 1
        else:
            break
    return h_index

# Example usage:
citations1 = [3, 0, 6, 1, 5]
citations2 = [1, 3, 1]
print(hIndex(citations1))  # Output: 3
print(hIndex(citations2))  # Output: 1
```

## Time Complexity

Sorting the list of citations has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), where `n` is the number of papers. Iterating through the list has a time complexity of \(O(n)\). Therefore, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is dominated by the sorting step, which is \(O(n \log n)\).
