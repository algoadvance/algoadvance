title:  Coordinate With Maximum Network Quality-out
permalink: /s1620
---

You are given an array `towers`, where `towers[i] = [xi, yi, qi]` denotes the coordinates `(xi, yi)` of the i-th cell tower and its quality factor `qi`. You are also given an integer `radius` denoting the maximum distance in which the tower can have an effect on the quality of service at a point.

The quality of service at point `(x, y)` is calculated as the sum of the integer part of the quality contribution of all the towers within the radius, where the quality contribution of a tower at `(xi, yi)` with quality factor `qi` to the point `(x, y)` is calculated as:

\[ \frac{q_i}{1 + d} \]

where `d` is the Euclidean distance between `(x, y)` and `(xi, yi)`.

Return the coordinates of the point with the maximum network quality. If there are multiple points with the same network quality, return the lexicographically smallest coordinates.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can multiple towers overlap each other?**
   - Yes, towers can overlap.

2. **How do you handle ties where multiple points have the same quality?**
   - Return the lexicographically smallest coordinates in such cases.

3. **Whatâ€™s the range for the coordinates and quality factors?**
   - The constraints are:
     - `1 <= towers.length <= 50`
     - `towers[i].length == 3`
     - `0 <= x_i, y_i, q_i <= 50`
     - `1 <= radius <= 50`

4. **Should the returned coordinates be integers?**
   - Yes, the returned coordinates should be integers.

### Strategy

1. **Brute Force Approach**:
    - Iterate over all possible points within the maximum bounds given by tower coordinates plus the radius.
    - For each point, calculate the network quality by summing the contributions from each tower within the effective radius.
    - Track the point with the maximum network quality. In case of a tie, choose the smallest coordinates lexicographically.

### Code

```python
from math import sqrt

def bestCoordinate(towers, radius):
    def calculate_quality(x, y):
        quality = 0
        for xi, yi, qi in towers:
            d = sqrt((xi - x) ** 2 + (yi - y) ** 2)
            if d <= radius:
                quality += int(qi / (1 + d))
        return quality

    max_quality = 0
    best_point = (0, 0)

    for x in range(51):
        for y in range(51):
            current_quality = calculate_quality(x, y)
            if current_quality > max_quality or (current_quality == max_quality and (x, y) < best_point):
                max_quality = current_quality
                best_point = (x, y)
    
    return list(best_point)
```

### Time Complexity

- **Brute Force Approach**:
    - We are iterating over a 51x51 grid of possible points.
    - For each point, we calculate the quality of all towers which involves iterating through the `towers` list.
    - Therefore, the time complexity is \(O(51 * 51 * T)\), where `T` is the number of towers.
    - In the worst case, the time complexity would be \(O(51 * 51 * 50)\), which simplifies to \(O(130050)\). 

This brute force approach is feasible within the provided constraints.
