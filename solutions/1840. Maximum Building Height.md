title:  Maximum Building Height-out
permalink: /s1840
---

You are given an integer `n` and a 2D integer array `restrictions` where `restrictions[i] = [id_i, maxHeight_i]` indicates that building at position `id_i` must have a height `maxHeight_i`.

The building heights at positions 0 and n+1 are 0.

Return the maximum possible height of the buildings in the range `[1, n]` inclusive.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can buildings increase or decrease in height by more than one per unit distance?**
   - Yes, the height difference between two adjacent positions can be at most one unit.

2. **Do the positions in the `restrictions` array need to be sorted?**
   - No, but we will need to sort them to process constraints correctly.

3. **What is the significance of positions 0 and n+1 having a height of 0?**
   - They establish boundary conditions which help in determining the maximum possible height in the range `[1, n]`.

### Strategy

1. **Sort Restrictions**: Start by sorting the `restrictions` array by the `id_i` to facilitate the height constraints processing.

2. **Propagate Constraints Forward**: From the left to right, compute the maximum possible height at each restriction such that it adheres to the constraints of the previous restricted building.

3. **Propagate Constraints Backward**: From the right to left, do the same to ensure all backward constraints are met.

4. **Determine Maximum Possible Heights**: Evaluate the maximum building heights obtainable between each pair of restrictions and compute the maximum height overall.

### Code

```python
def maxBuilding(n, restrictions):
    if not restrictions:
        return n  # If there are no restrictions, max height is just n

    # Add boundary conditions to the restrictions list
    restrictions.append([1, 0]) # Add the starting boundary condition
    restrictions.sort()

    # Forward pass to limit heights by constraints going from left to right
    for i in range(1, len(restrictions)):
        dist = restrictions[i][0] - restrictions[i-1][0]
        restrictions[i][1] = min(restrictions[i][1], restrictions[i-1][1] + dist)
    
    # Backward pass to limit heights by constraints going from right to left
    for i in range(len(restrictions) - 2, -1, -1):
        dist = restrictions[i+1][0] - restrictions[i][0]
        restrictions[i][1] = min(restrictions[i][1], restrictions[i+1][1] + dist)
    
    max_height = 0

    # Compute maximum possible height between each pair of restrictions
    for i in range(1, len(restrictions)):
        left_pos, left_height = restrictions[i-1]
        right_pos, right_height = restrictions[i]
        dist = right_pos - left_pos
        max_height = max(max_height, (left_height + right_height + dist) // 2)
    
    return max_height

# Example Test Case
print(maxBuilding(5, [[2, 1], [4, 1]]))  # Output: 2

```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(m \log m + m)\), where \(m\) is the number of restrictions.
- Sorting the restrictions takes \(O(m \log m)\).
- Forward and Backward propagation each take \(O(m)\).
- Calculating the maximum height also takes \(O(m)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, \(O(m \log m)\).
