title:  Minimum Cost to Change the Final Value of Expression-out
permalink: /s1896
---

You are given a valid boolean expression consisting of the characters `'1'`, `'0'`, `'&'` (AND), and `'|'` (OR), along with parentheses `(` and `)`. Your task is to determine the minimum cost to change the final value of the expression. Each change involves flipping a `'1'` to `'0'` or a `'0'` to `'1'`, or changing an `&` to `|` or `|` to `&`. Each type of change has a specific cost associated with it.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Is there any information regarding the cost associated with each type of change (flipping a bit or changing an operator)?
   - **A:** The problem typically should provide this information, but itâ€™s not yet clear. We might have to assume uniform costs (e.g., cost of 1 for all changes) or consider some default costs, e.g., flip cost = 1, and operator change cost = 1.

2. **Q:** Is the input expression guaranteed to be valid and properly parenthesized?
   - **A:** Yes, as per the problem statement, the input expression is valid and properly parenthesized.

3. **Q:** Will the expression always contain at least one operator and one operand?
   - **A:** Given it's a boolean expression, it will contain at least one operand.

### Strategy

1. **Parse the Expression:** Use a stack-based approach to evaluate the boolean expression and simultaneously track the cost of flipping the final result.

2. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach:** As we parse the expression, use dynamic programming to store two values at each sub-expression:
   - Cost to make the sub-expression result `True`.
   - Cost to make the sub-expression result `False`.

3. **Combination of Results:** For each operator, store combined results considering both `True` and `False` outcomes, and calculate the minimum cost to achieve these outcomes from either operand.

4. **Propagation:** Propagate these results up to the entire expression to extract the minimum cost for flipping the final result.

### Code

```python
def minCostToChange(expr: str) -> int:
    def eval_cost(expr, start, end):
        if start > end:
            return float('inf'), float('inf')
        
        if expr[start] == '1':
            return 0, 1  # cost to make 1 to 1 is 0, cost to make 1 to 0 is 1
        elif expr[start] == '0':
            return 1, 0  # cost to make 0 to 1 is 1, cost to make 0 to 0 is 0

        min_true, min_false = float('inf'), float('inf')
        stack = 0

        for i in range(start, end + 1):
            if expr[i] == '(':
                stack += 1
            elif expr[i] == ')':
                stack -= 1
            elif stack == 0 and (expr[i] == '&' or expr[i] == '|'):
                left_true, left_false = eval_cost(expr, start, i - 1)
                right_true, right_false = eval_cost(expr, i + 1, end)

                if expr[i] == '&':
                    min_true = min(min_true, left_true + right_true)
                    min_false = min(min_false, 
                                    left_false + right_false,
                                    left_false + right_true + 1,
                                    left_true + right_false + 1)
                elif expr[i] == '|':
                    min_true = min(min_true, 
                                   left_true + right_true,
                                   left_true + right_false + 1,
                                   left_false + right_true + 1)
                    min_false = min(min_false, left_false + right_false)
        
        if stack != 0:
            return eval_cost(expr, start + 1, end - 1)
        
        return min_true, min_false

    final_true, final_false = eval_cost(expr, 0, len(expr) - 1)
    initial_result = eval(expr)
    
    return final_false if initial_result else final_true

# Example usage:
expr = "(1&0)"
print(minCostToChange(expr))  # Expected Output: 1 (By changing `&` to `|`)
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n^3) due to the recursive evaluation of all sub-expressions, where `n` is the length of the expression.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n^2) for storing results of sub-expressions in dynamic programming tables.

This complexity might be optimized further with memoization or more efficient parsing techniques.
