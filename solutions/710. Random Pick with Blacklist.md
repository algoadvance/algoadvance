title:  Random Pick with Blacklist-out
permalink: /s710
---

Given a blacklist `B` containing integers from 0 to `N-1`, write a function that initializes the object with the integer `N` and the list `B`. Then, write a function `pick` that returns a random integer in the range `[0, N-1]` that is not in the blacklist.

**Example:**

```python
Input:
["Solution","pick","pick","pick"]
[[7, [2, 3, 5]],[],[],[]]
Output:
[null, 0, 4, 1]

Explanation:
Solution solution = new Solution(7, [2, 3, 5])
solution.pick() # returns 0, since 0 is not in the blacklist
solution.pick() # returns 4, since 4 is not in the blacklist
solution.pick() # returns 1, since 1 is not in the blacklist
```

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= N <= $10^9$
- 0 <= `B.length` <= min(100000, N-1)
- 0 <= `B[i]` < N
- All the values of `B` are unique.
- The `pick` function can be called at most $2*10^4$ times.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the `N` be very large?
    - **A:** Yes, `N` can be as large as $10^9$.

2. **Q:** How large can the blacklist `B` be?
    - **A:** The blacklist can have up to 100,000 elements but not larger than `N-1`.

3. **Q:** Are the elements in the blacklist always unique?
    - **A:** Yes, the elements in the blacklist are unique.

## Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
    - Calculate the total number of valid numbers which are not in the blacklist: `valid_count = N - len(B)`.
    - Use a map to "remap" the blacklisted numbers to numbers that are outside the range of the valid numbers.

2. **Remapping Logic:**
    - Create a set of blacklisted numbers which are in the range `[0, valid_count-1]` (let's call this `blacklist_small`).
    - Create a list of numbers which are in the range `[valid_count, N-1]` but not in the blacklist, this list will serve as "replacement candidates" for remapping numbers in `blacklist_small`.

3. **Random Pick:**
    - Pick a random integer in the range `[0, valid_count-1]`.
    - If this integer is in `blacklist_small`, remap it to one of the "replacement candidates".
    - Return the integer (either remapped or the original valid integer).

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization:** `O(B.memory + N.log(N))` due to creation of the set and the list for replacements and sorting operations if needed.
- **Pick Operation:** `O(1)` on average since it's mostly dictionary and list lookups.

## Code

```python
import random

class Solution:

    def __init__(self, N: int, blacklist: List[int]):
        self.valid_count = N - len(blacklist)
        self.remap = {}
        
        blacklist_set = set(blacklist)
        
        last = N - 1
        for b in blacklist:
            if b < self.valid_count:
                while last in blacklist_set:
                    last -= 1
                self.remap[b] = last
                last -= 1

    def pick(self) -> int:
        index = random.randint(0, self.valid_count - 1)
        return self.remap.get(index, index)

# Example Usage:
# solution = Solution(7, [2, 3, 5])
# print(solution.pick())
# print(solution.pick())
# print(solution.pick())
```

The above code ensures that on each call to `pick`, the number returned is random and not part of the blacklist, achieving an O(1) time complexity for the pick operation.
