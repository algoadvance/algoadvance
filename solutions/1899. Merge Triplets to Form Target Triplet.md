title:  Merge Triplets to Form Target Triplet-out
permalink: /s1899
---

Given a list of triplets (each triplet is a list of three integers) and a target triplet. You need to determine if you can select some triplets from the given list and form the target triplet. A target triplet is formed by taking the maximum value on each of the indices from the selected triplets.

For example:
```
triplets = [[2,5,3],[1,8,4],[1,7,5]], target = [2,7,5]
```

To form the target triplet [2,7,5], you can select triplet [2,5,3], and [1,7,5]:
```
max(2, 1) = 2
max(5, 7) = 7
max(3, 5) = 5
```

If you can form the target triplet this way, return `True`, otherwise return `False`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the input triplets contain negative numbers? 
2. Will the triplet list always have valid triplets, i.e., lists of exactly 3 integers?
3. Should we consider ordering of the triplets while forming the target?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to check if the target triplet can be formed as described. We can use the following approach:

1. **Filter Invalid Triplets**: First, we filter out any triplets from the list that couldn't possibly contribute to forming the target triplet. A triplet is invalid if any of its elements exceed the corresponding element in the target triplet.
  
2. **Contribution Check**: Next, we check if by combining the valid triplets, we can match each element of the target triplet. We keep three flags to track if we've successfully found a contributing triplet for each of the target triplet's indices (0, 1, 2).

3. **Return Result**: If all flags are set to `True` by the end of our checks, return `True`. Otherwise, return `False`.

We can then implement this approach in code.

### Code

```python
def mergeTriplets(triplets, target):
    can_achieve = [False, False, False]
    
    for triplet in triplets:
        # Check if triplet is valid
        if (triplet[0] <= target[0] and
            triplet[1] <= target[1] and
            triplet[2] <= target[2]):
            
            # Check for contribution
            if triplet[0] == target[0]:
                can_achieve[0] = True
            if triplet[1] == target[1]:
                can_achieve[1] = True
            if triplet[2] == target[2]:
                can_achieve[2] = True
                
    return all(can_achieve)

# Example usage:
triplets = [[2,5,3],[1,8,4],[1,7,5]]
target = [2,7,5]
print(mergeTriplets(triplets, target))  # Output: True
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of triplets in the input list. This is because we iterate over the list once, and each operation inside the loop takes constant time \(O(1)\).
