title:  Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations-out
permalink: /s2011
---

You are given a list of strings `operations` where each string represents a single operation on a variable `X` that starts at 0. Only two types of operations are allowed: increment (`"++X"` or `"X++"`), and decrement (`"--X"` or `"X--"`).

Your task is to determine the final value of `X` after performing all the operations.

**Example:**
```python
operations = ["--X", "X++", "X++"]
```
The final value of `X` should be 1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any invalid operations in the list?**
   - No, all operations in the list are valid (either increment or decrement).

2. **Does the starting value of `X` always equal 0?**
   - Yes, `X` always starts at 0.

3. **Is the length of the list limited?**
   - The list can be of any length, but we assume it fits within the standard constraints of competitive programming exercises.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:** Start with `X` initialized to 0.
2. **Iteration:** Iterate through the list of operations.
3. **Condition Checking:** Check each operation:
   - If it is an increment operation (`"++X"` or `"X++"`), increase `X` by 1.
   - If it is a decrement operation (`"--X"` or `"X--"`), decrease `X` by 1.
4. **Final Result:** Return the final value of `X`.

### Code

Hereâ€™s how you can implement this strategy in Python:

```python
def final_value_after_operations(operations):
    X = 0
    for operation in operations:
        if operation in ("++X", "X++"):
            X += 1
        elif operation in ("--X", "X--"):
            X -= 1
    return X

# Example usage
operations = ["--X", "X++", "X++"]
print(final_value_after_operations(operations))  # Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of operations in the list. This is because we are simply iterating through the list once and performing constant-time operations within the loop.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity for this solution is **O(1)**. We are only using a fixed amount of extra space for the variable `X`, regardless of the input size.
