title:  Number of Different Subsequences GCDs-out
permalink: /s1819
---

Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of different GCDs among all non-empty subsequences of `nums`.

A subsequence of an array is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the elements in `nums`?**
   - The elements of `nums` are in the range from `1` to `2 * 10^5`.

2. **What is the length of `nums`?**
   - The length of `nums` is in the range from `1` to `10^5`.

3. **Do we need to consider performance optimization due to constraints?**
   - Yes, considering the potential size of `nums`, an efficient solution is necessary.

### Strategy

1. **Observation:**
   - The GCD of a subsequence is at most the maximum value in the array.
   - The possible values for GCDs can range from `1` to the maximum value in `nums`.

2. **Approach:**
   - Use a set to keep track of the unique GCDs found.
   - For each possible GCD value `g`, check if it can be the GCD of any subsequence in nums:
     - Try to construct a subsequence with GCD `g` by checking multiples of `g`.
     - For a given potential GCD `g`, gather multiples of `g` and compute their GCDs.

3. **Implementation:**
   - Iterate over all possible values for GCD from `1` to maximum value in `nums`.
   - For each value, collect elements in the array which are multiples of `g` and check if they can form a subsequence with GCD equal to `g`.

### Time Complexity

- Checking all multiples for each possible GCD value and computing their GCD can be optimized using properties of the GCD function. The overall complexity is influenced by the maximum value in `nums` and the operations needed for each checked value.

### Code

```python
from math import gcd
from functools import reduce

def countDifferentGCDs(nums):
    max_num = max(nums)
    nums_set = set(nums)
    distinct_gcds = 0

    # Function to calculate the GCD of list elements
    def find_gcd(arr):
        return reduce(gcd, arr)

    for g in range(1, max_num + 1):
        common_gcd = 0
        for multiple in range(g, max_num + 1, g):
            if multiple in nums_set:
                common_gcd = gcd(common_gcd, multiple)
                # If at any point, the common GCD becomes 'g', we know 'g' is achievable
                if common_gcd == g:
                    distinct_gcds += 1
                    break

    return distinct_gcds

# Example usage:
nums = [6, 10, 3]
print(countDifferentGCDs(nums))  # Output should reflect the number of unique GCDs of subsequences
```

### Explanation

1. **Find the Maximum Value in `nums`:** This value determines the range of potential GCDs we need to check.
2. **Initialize a Set for `nums`:** This helps in quick look-ups for multiples during iteration.
3. **Iterate Through Possible GCD Values (1 to max_num):** 
   - For each possible GCD value `g`, iterate through its multiples.
   - Check if these multiples are present in `nums` and compute their GCD.
   - If the computed GCD equals `g` at any point, it is a valid subsequence GCD.
4. **Increment the Distinct GCD Counter:** Whenever a valid GCD is found.

### Edge Cases

- Ensure that the solution handles arrays with a single element correctly.
- Ensure that the solution efficiently calculates the GCD even for large arrays.

By using this approach, we ensure that the solution is both correct and efficient given the constraints.
