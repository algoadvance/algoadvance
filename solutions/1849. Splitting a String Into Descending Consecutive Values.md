LeetCode Problem 1849: "Splitting a String Into Descending Consecutive Values"

- **Difficulty:** Medium
- **Prompt:** 

You are given a string `s` that consists of only digits. Check if the string can be split into several parts such that each part is a **positive integer** and each part is exactly **one less** than the previous part.

Return `true` if it is possible to split the string as described above, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

Before we start, let's clarify some assumptions:
1. Can parts have leading zeros?
   - **No:** Parts have no leading zeros as they are positive integers.
2. What is the length range of `s`?
   - The length range of `s` can be up to `10^10`.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Convert different possible starting segments of the string into integers, these represent the start of a counting sequence.
   
2. **Recursive Function**:
   - Use a helper recursive function to determine if the rest of the string can be divided into descending sequential integers starting from the initial segment.
   - At each step: 
       - Form the next expected number in the sequence and check if the current segment of the string matches it.
       - If it matches, then recursively check the remainder of the string.
   
3. **Early Exit**:
   - If a possible segmentation is found, return `True`.
   - If all possibilities are exhausted and no valid segmentation is found, return `False`.

### Time Complexity

- Analyzing exact complexity can be tricky due to recursive branching, but the routine mainly performs substring operations and integer comparisons, which may lead to polynomial or worse-case exponential behavior in some cases.

### Code Implementation

```python
def splitString(s: str) -> bool:
    def can_split(s, prev):
        if not s:
            return True
        for i in range(1, len(s) + 1):
            num = int(s[:i])
            if num + 1 == prev:
                if can_split(s[i:], num):
                    return True
        return False

    for i in range(1, len(s)):
        start_num = int(s[:i])
        if can_split(s[i:], start_num):
            return True
            
    return False

# Example usage:
print(splitString("1234"))  # Expected output: False
print(splitString("050043"))  # Expected output: True
print(splitString("9080701"))  # Expected output: False
print(splitString("10009998"))  # Expected output: True
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Outer Loop**:
   - We iterate through possible divisions of the string, considering each possible starting segment (`s[:i]`) up to `len(s) - 1`.
   
2. **Recursive Helper Function** (`can_split`):
   - Takes the remaining string `s` and the previously considered number `prev`.
   - Checks if the immediate segment is one less than `prev`.
   - Continues recursively for the remaining string if a valid segment is found.
   
3. **Base Case**:
   - If the string is empty after consecutive splits, return `True`.

Overall, the function attempts to build a sequence of consecutive descending values by exploring all feasible segmentations of the string.
