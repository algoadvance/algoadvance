LeetCode 137 - Single Number II:

Given an integer array `nums` where every element appears three times except for one, which appears exactly once. Find that single one. You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of values that can be contained in the array?
   - The values can be any integer within the standard limits of a 32-bit signed integer.

2. Can the array be empty?
   - No, the array will have at least one element.

3. Can the input contain negative numbers?
   - Yes, the input array can contain negative numbers.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to use bit manipulation to ensure both linear runtime and constant space complexity. Here's the thought process:

1. We'll use two variables to keep track of the bits occurring in the input list: `ones` and `twos`.
2. `ones` will store the bits which have appeared exactly once.
3. `twos` will store the bits which have appeared exactly twice.
4. When a bit appears the third time, it will be reset from `ones` and `twos`.

By the end of the traversal, `ones` will contain the bits of the number that appears exactly once.

### Code

```python
def singleNumber(nums):
    # Initialize two variables to store the bits
    ones, twos = 0, 0

    for num in nums:
        # First appearance:
        # Add num to 'ones' if it is not there in 'twos'
        ones = (ones ^ num) & ~twos
        
        # Second appearance:
        # Add num to 'twos' if it is not there in 'ones'
        twos = (twos ^ num) & ~ones

    return ones

# Example usage
nums = [2, 2, 3, 2]
print(singleNumber(nums))  # Output: 3
```

### Explanation of Code

1. **Initialization:**
   - `ones`, `twos` are initialized to `0`.

2. **Loop through each number in the array:**
   - For each number (`num`):
     - Update `ones` only if the current number is not already in `twos`. This ensures that `ones` holds bits for numbers appearing the first time.
     - Update `twos` only if the current number is not already in `ones`. This ensures that `twos` holds bits for numbers appearing the second time.
     
3. **Return `ones`:**
   - After processing all numbers, `ones` will hold the bits of the number that appears exactly once in the array.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the input array `nums`. We only pass through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1). We use a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.

This solution ensures both the required linear runtime and constant extra space usage.
