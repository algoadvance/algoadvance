title:  Product of the Last K Numbers-out
permalink: /s1352
---

Design an algorithm that efficiently computes the product of the last `k` numbers in a sequence of numbers. Implement the `ProductOfNumbers` class:

- `ProductOfNumbers()` Initializes the object with an empty sequence of numbers.
- `void add(int num)` Appends the integer `num` to the sequence.
- `int getProduct(int k)` Returns the product of the last `k` numbers in the current sequence. The answer is guaranteed to fit in a single 32-bit integer.

The problem also states that the product of an empty subsequence is 1, but you can assume the sequence will never be empty.

## Example

```python
productOfNumbers = ProductOfNumbers()
productOfNumbers.add(3)        # [3]
productOfNumbers.add(0)        # [3,0]
productOfNumbers.add(2)        # [3,0,2]
productOfNumbers.add(5)        # [3,0,2,5]
productOfNumbers.add(4)        # [3,0,2,5,4]
productOfNumbers.getProduct(2) # return 20. The product of the last 2 numbers is 5 * 4 = 20
productOfNumbers.getProduct(3) # return 40. The product of the last 3 numbers is 2 * 5 * 4 = 40
productOfNumbers.getProduct(4) # return 0. The product of the last 4 numbers is 0 * 2 * 5 * 4 = 0
productOfNumbers.add(8)        # [3,0,2,5,4,8]
productOfNumbers.getProduct(2) # return 32. The product of the last 2 numbers is 4 * 8 = 32
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can there be negative numbers?
2. Is it guaranteed that `getProduct(k)` is always called with `k` such that `k` <= length of the sequence?

## Strategy

To efficiently get the product of the last `k` numbers, we can use a list to store the prefix products:
- The `add` method will store the running product of the numbers in sequence.
- If a zero is added, it interrupts the product sequence, we reset the product list to restart the product calculation post zero.
- The `getProduct` method will use the prefix products to compute the product of the last `k` numbers efficiently.

## Code

```python
class ProductOfNumbers:
    def __init__(self):
        self.products = [1]

    def add(self, num: int) -> None:
        if num == 0:
            self.products = [1]
        else:
            self.products.append(self.products[-1] * num)
    
    def getProduct(self, k: int) -> int:
        if k >= len(self.products):
            return 0
        return self.products[-1] // self.products[-1 - k]

# Example usage:
productOfNumbers = ProductOfNumbers()
productOfNumbers.add(3)
productOfNumbers.add(0)
productOfNumbers.add(2)
productOfNumbers.add(5)
productOfNumbers.add(4)
print(productOfNumbers.getProduct(2)) # return 20
print(productOfNumbers.getProduct(3)) # return 40
print(productOfNumbers.getProduct(4)) # return 0
productOfNumbers.add(8)
print(productOfNumbers.getProduct(2)) # return 32
```

## Time Complexity

- `add(num)`: O(1). Adding a number involves appending to the list, which is constant time.
- `getProduct(k)`: O(1). Computing the product involves O(1) operations using the prefix product array.

This approach ensures that both `add` and `getProduct` operations are efficient.
