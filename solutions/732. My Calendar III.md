You are implementing a program to manage calendar bookings where multiple booking requests may overlap. Your goal is to determine the maximum number of concurrent bookings at any given time after each booking request.

Implement the `MyCalendarThree` class:
- `MyCalendarThree()`: Initializes the object.
- `int book(int start, int end)`: Records a booking event from time `start` to time `end` (exclusive) and returns an integer representing the maximum number of concurrent bookings so far.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the ranges for the `start` and `end` times?**
   - Typically, these would be non-negative integers.
2. **What should the behavior be if `start` is equal to `end`?**
   - In this problem, it implies no time is actually booked, and generally, you can assume `start < end`.
3. **Can `start` or `end` times repeat among different bookings?**
   - Yes, timestamps can be the same for different bookings.

### Strategy

1. **Event Points**: We can use a map (or dictionary) to keep track of changes at specific time points. Each `start` time increases the count of ongoing bookings, and each `end` time decreases it.
2. **Sweep Line Algorithm**: Sort the keys (unique time points) and then process these events in order to keep track of the number of concurrent bookings.

### Code

Here is the Python implementation:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class MyCalendarThree:

    def __init__(self):
        # We use a defaultdict to store increments at start and decrements at end times.
        self.delta = defaultdict(int)

    def book(self, start: int, end: int) -> int:
        # Increment the start time by 1 (a booking starts)
        self.delta[start] += 1
        # Decrement the end time by 1 (a booking ends)
        self.delta[end] -= 1
                
        # Calculate the maximum number of concurrent bookings
        current_bookings = 0
        max_concurrent = 0
        
        for key in sorted(self.delta.keys()):
            current_bookings += self.delta[key]
            max_concurrent = max(max_concurrent, current_bookings)
            
        return max_concurrent
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: The initialization of the `MyCalendarThree` object runs in \(O(1)\).
- **`book` Method**: Each call to the `book` method will iterate over the sorted time points:
  - Adding or updating entries in `self.delta` takes \(O(1)\).
  - Sorting the keys and calculating the maximum overlap takes \(O(K \log K)\), where \(K\) is the number of unique time points inserted so far.

Thus, the overall time complexity for the `book` function in the worst case is \(O(K \log K)\) for each booking, where \(K\) represents the number of unique time points. Note that \(K\) can be as large as twice the number of bookings since each booking has one `start` and one `end`.

This solution efficiently handles overlapping bookings and allows us to track the maximum number of concurrent events dynamically.
