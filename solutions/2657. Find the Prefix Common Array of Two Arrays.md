2657. Find the Prefix Common Array of Two Arrays

You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays `A` and `B` of length `n`. The prefix common array of `A` and `B` is an array `C` such that `C[i]` is equal to the number of integers that are present in both the prefix arrays `A[0...i]` and `B[0...i]`. 

Return the prefix common array of `A` and `B`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the arrays contain duplicate elements? 
   - No, the elements in the arrays are unique as per the implied problem constraints (otherwise the interpretation of common elements per prefix would be ambiguous).
2. What is the expected output when `n` is 0?
   - If the arrays are empty, the output should also be an empty array.
3. What is the range of values for the elements in arrays `A` and `B`?
   - Assuming based on the problem constraints, the elements are within a reasonable range to use direct value checks (like in range 1 to 1000).

### Strategy
1. Initialize an empty result array `C` of length `n`.
2. Use two sets to keep track of elements seen so far for both arrays A and B.
3. Iterate through indices from `0` to `n-1`:
    1. Add the current element of `A` to the set for tracking `A`.
    2. Add the current element of `B` to the set for tracking `B`.
    3. Compute the intersection of these two sets to determine the number of common elements seen so far.
    4. Store the size of this intersection in the corresponding index of result array `C`.
4. Return the array `C`.

### Code
```python
def findThePrefixCommonArray(A: list[int], B: list[int]) -> list[int]:
    n = len(A)
    common_array = []
    seen_A = set()
    seen_B = set()
    
    for i in range(n):
        seen_A.add(A[i])
        seen_B.add(B[i])
        
        # Find common elements seen so far using intersection
        common_count = len(seen_A & seen_B)
        common_array.append(common_count)
        
    return common_array

# Example usage:
# A = [1, 3, 2, 4]
# B = [3, 1, 2, 4]
# Output should be [0, 1, 3, 4]
print(findThePrefixCommonArray([1, 3, 2, 4], [3, 1, 2, 4]))
```

### Time Complexity
- Constructing the sets and computing intersections for each index `i` involves constant time complexity for individual operations like `add` and `intersection`.
- Given `n` iterations, the total time complexity is `O(n)`.

### Explanation:
- `seen_A` and `seen_B` are used to track unique elements seen so far in `A` and `B` respectively.
- The operation `len(seen_A & seen_B)` efficiently computes the count of common elements seen so far.
- This ensures each prefix processing step takes `O(1)` within each iteration of `O(n)` total steps.
