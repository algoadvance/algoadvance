title:  Binary Tree Zigzag Level Order Traversal-out
permalink: /s103
---

Given the root of a binary tree, return the zigzag level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, then right to left for the next level and alternate between).

### Example:
```
Input: root = [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
Output: [[3],[20,9],[15,7]]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we return if the tree is empty?**
   - If the tree is empty, we should return an empty list `[]`.

2. **Are all node values unique?**
   - Yes, typically in binary tree traversal problems, all node values are unique, making it straightforward to handle.

3. **How should we handle levels with `None` values/intermediate `None` nodes?**
   - Since the traversal is only concerned with existing nodes, intermediate `None` values shouldnâ€™t affect the traversal.

## Strategy

1. **Level Order Traversal:** We can use a BFS (Breadth-First Search) approach for level order traversal. This involves using a queue to keep track of nodes at the current level, then processing nodes for the next level.

2. **Zigzag Pattern:** To implement the zigzag pattern, we use a flag (`left_to_right`) to toggle the order of traversal at each level. If `left_to_right` is true, append nodes' values in normal order, otherwise append in reverse order.

3. **Process:**
   - Initialize a queue and begin with the root node.
   - Iterate until the queue is empty.
   - For each level, collect nodes' values.
   - Depending on the `left_to_right` flag, either append or prepend these values to the result list.
   - Toggle the `left_to_right` flag after processing each level.

By the end of the traversal, we will have the nodes' values in zigzag level order.

## Code

```python
from collections import deque

# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def zigzagLevelOrder(root: TreeNode):
    if not root:
        return []

    results = []
    node_queue = deque([root])
    left_to_right = True

    while node_queue:
        level_size = node_queue.qsize()  # Number of nodes at the current level
        level_nodes = []
        
        for _ in range(level_size):
            node = node_queue.popleft()
            level_nodes.append(node.val)
            if node.left:
                node_queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                node_queue.append(node.right)
        
        if not left_to_right:
            level_nodes.reverse()
        
        results.append(level_nodes)
        left_to_right = not left_to_right

    return results
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N)
  - Every node is visited exactly once, hence the time complexity is proportional to the number of nodes in the tree.

- **Space Complexity:** O(N)
  - In the worst case, the space needed for the queue will be proportional to the maximum number of nodes at any level of the tree, which is also O(N).
