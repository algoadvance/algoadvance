title:  Maximum Product of Splitted Binary Tree-out
permalink: /s1339

### Problem Statement

Given a binary tree, you need to split the tree into two subtrees by removing exactly one edge such that the product of the sums of the resulting two subtrees is maximized. The answer may be too large, so return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the values of the nodes in the tree?**
   - Values are typically within the constraints of a 32-bit integer.
   
2. **Can the tree be empty?**
   - No, it is guaranteed that the tree will have at least one node.

3. **Is the input always a valid binary tree?**
   - Yes, the input will always be a valid binary tree.

### Strategy

1. **Calculate the total sum of the tree:**
   - Perform a DFS traversal and sum up all the values in the tree to get the total sum. Let this be `total_sum`.
   
2. **Find the maximum product of the split:**
   - During the DFS traversal, compute the sum of each subtree. Calculate the product of the sum of the subtree and the sum of the remaining part of the tree (`total_sum - subtree_sum`).
   - Track the maximum product encountered during the traversal.

3. **Return the result modulo 10^9 + 7.**

### Code

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

class Solution:
    def maxProduct(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7
        
        # Step 1: Calculate the total sum of the tree
        def calculate_total_sum(node):
            if not node:
                return 0
            return node.val + calculate_total_sum(node.left) + calculate_total_sum(node.right)
        
        total_sum = calculate_total_sum(root)
        
        # Step 2: Find the maximum product
        self.max_product = 0
        
        def max_product_helper(node):
            if not node:
                return 0
            subtree_sum = node.val + max_product_helper(node.left) + max_product_helper(node.right)
            # Calculate the product of the split
            product = subtree_sum * (total_sum - subtree_sum)
            # Update the maximum product
            self.max_product = max(self.max_product, product)
            return subtree_sum
        
        max_product_helper(root)
        
        return self.max_product % MOD
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Calculating the total sum:** This requires a single DFS traversal of the tree, which takes O(N) time, where N is the number of nodes.
2. **Finding the maximum product:** This requires another DFS traversal, which also takes O(N) time.

So, the overall time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursive call stack used during the DFS traversal. In the worst case (unbalanced tree), this could be O(N).

I hope this breakdown helps! If you have any questions or need further clarifications, feel free to ask.
