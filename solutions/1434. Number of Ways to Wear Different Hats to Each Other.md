`1434. Number of Ways to Wear Different Hats to Each Other`

There are `n` people and 40 different hats labeled from `1` to `40`.

Given a 2D list `hats`, where `hats[i]` is a list of all hats the `i-th` person likes, return the number of ways that the `n` people can wear different hats to each other modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Each hat can be worn by only one person at a time.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can each person wear only one hat?**
   - Yes, each person can wear only one hat, and each hat can be worn by only one person.

2. **Do we have to consider only the hats liked by each person?**
   - Yes, each person can only wear a hat from their preferences.

3. **Is there a limit on the number of people `n`?**
   - The problem constraints typically won't be too large, but our solution needs to be efficient to handle worst-case scenarios.

### Strategy

We'll use dynamic programming and bitmasking to find the solution. Here's the plan:

1. **Represent state with bitmask**: We can use a bitmask to represent which people have already chosen a hat.
2. **Dynamic Programming Transition**: Maintain a DP table `dp[mask][hat]` where `mask` represents the set of people who have already worn hats, and `hat` represents the current hat we're considering. `dp[mask][hat]` tells the number of ways we can assign hats up to `hat`.
3. **Initialization**: Start with no hats assigned (`dp[0][0] = 1`).
4. **Transitions**: For each hat and each possible combination of people who might have already assigned hats, iterate and update the DP table.
5. **Final Computation**: Once we've processed all hats, the result will be the number of ways all hats are assigned to people.

**Edge Cases**:
- If no person likes any hat, there should be 0 ways.
- Handles cases where `n` <= 10 efficiently.

### Code

Here is the Python implementation of the described strategy:

```python
def numberWays(hats):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    n = len(hats)
    
    # reverse the relation: which people like a given hat (1-indexed)
    people_who_like_hat = [[] for _ in range(41)]
    for person, liked_hats in enumerate(hats):
        for hat in liked_hats:
            people_who_like_hat[hat].append(person)
    
    # DP state: dp[used_mask][hat] - number of ways to distribute hats till the specific hat with specific people as used
    dp = [0] * (1 << n)
    dp[0] = 1
    
    for hat in range(1, 41):
        new_dp = dp[:]
        for used_mask in range(1 << n):
            for person in people_who_like_hat[hat]:
                if used_mask & (1 << person) == 0: # if person has not been assigned a hat yet
                    new_dp[used_mask | (1 << person)] += dp[used_mask]
                    new_dp[used_mask | (1 << person)] %= MOD
        dp = new_dp
    
    return dp[(1 << n) - 1]

# Example usage:
hats = [[3, 4], [4, 5], [5]]
print(numberWays(hats))  # Output: expected number of ways
```

### Time Complexity

- **State Space Complexity**: The DP table has a possible state space of `O(2^n * 40)`.
- **Transition Complexity**: For each person and each hat, we check combinations leading to a complexity of `O(40 * n * 2^n)`.

Thus, overall the solution has a complexity of `O(40 * n * 2^n)`, which is feasible given typical constraints for manageable values of `n` up to around 10.
