title:  Shortest Path with Alternating Colors-out
permalink: /s1129
---

You are given an undirected graph in the form of two arrays `redEdges` and `blueEdges` where:
- `redEdges[i] = [a, b]` indicates that there is a red edge between node `a` and node `b`.
- `blueEdges[i] = [a, b]` indicates that there is a blue edge between node `a` and node `b`.

Return an array `answer` of length `n` where `answer[x]` is the length of the shortest path from node `0` to node `x` such that the edges included in the path alternate in color.

If there is no such path from node `0` to node `x`, set `answer[x]` to `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Graph Representation**: Is the graph directed or undirected?
   - As per the problem statement, the graph is undirected.

2. **Edge Colors**: Are the edges' colors fixed?
   - Yes, each edge's color is fixed as specified in either `redEdges` or `blueEdges`.

3. **Multiple Edges**: Can there be multiple edges with different colors between the same nodes?
   - Yes, you can have both a red and a blue edge between any two nodes.

4. **Self-loops**: Can there be self-loops in the graph?
   - It's not specified, but typically we assume no self-loops unless otherwise stated.

5. **Edge Weights**: Are we considering edges to have weights?
   - All edges should have the same weight (constant), typically considered as 1.

### Strategy

- **Graph Representation**: Use adjacency lists to store red and blue edges separately.
- **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Use BFS to find the shortest path due to its properties of exploring level by level.
- **State Tracking**: Track the current node, current color, and the distance. Use a queue for BFS where each element is a tuple `(node, color, distance)`.
- **Visited States**: Maintain visited states separately for red and blue to avoid revisiting the same node with the same edge color.

### Code

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

def shortestAlternatingPaths(n, redEdges, blueEdges):
    # Create adjacency lists
    red_adj = defaultdict(list)
    blue_adj = defaultdict(list)
    
    for u, v in redEdges:
        red_adj[u].append(v)
        
    for u, v in blueEdges:
        blue_adj[u].append(v)
    
    # BFS queues and visited sets
    queue = deque([(0, 'r', 0), (0, 'b', 0)])  # (current_node, current_color, current_distance)
    visited = set([(0, 'r'), (0, 'b')])  # (node, last_edge_color)
    
    # Results array
    answer = [-1] * n
    answer[0] = 0  # Distance to start node is 0
    
    while queue:
        node, color, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        # Find next nodes to visit based on the color
        if color == 'r':
            # if coming from red edge, next should be blue
            next_adj = blue_adj
            next_color = 'b'
        else:
            # if coming from blue edge, next should be red
            next_adj = red_adj
            next_color = 'r'
        
        for neighbour in next_adj[node]:
            if (neighbour, next_color) not in visited:
                visited.add((neighbour, next_color))
                queue.append((neighbour, next_color, dist + 1))
                if answer[neighbour] == -1:  # Answer is only set if not set before
                    answer[neighbour] = dist + 1
    
    return answer
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n + e)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes and \(e\) is the number of edges. This is because every node and edge will be processed at most once in the BFS traversal.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n + e)\) for storing the adjacency list and the BFS queue.

This algorithm ensures that we find the shortest path with alternating colors efficiently.
