title:  Time Taken to Mark All Nodes-out
permalink: /s3241
---

You are given an undirected tree consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n-1`, where each node is represented as a unique integer.

The tree is rooted at node `0`, and all nodes are unmarked initially.

It takes `time[i]` seconds to mark node `i`. 
* If a node is marked, it remains marked and does not need to be marked again.
* Each node `i` can only be marked as soon as its parent node in the tree is marked.

Your task is to find the minimum time taken to mark all the nodes in the tree.

### Clarifying Questions

Before we proceed, let's understand few more details:

1. **Tree Structure**:
    - How is the tree structure given? Typically, the tree might be given in the form of an adjacency list or an edge list.
    
2. **Time Array**:
    - Is `time` array given in accordance to the node indices?

3. **Constraints**:
    - What are the lower and upper limits of `n` (number of nodes)?

Assuming:
- A list of edges `edges` such that `edges[i] = [u, v]` represents an edge between nodes `u` and `v`.
- An array `time` where `time[i]` represents the time taken to mark node `i`.

### Assumptions
1. The tree is rooted at node `0`.
2. The input is:
   - `n`: Integer representing the number of nodes.
   - `edges`: List of pairs representing the edges.
   - `time`: List of integers representing the marking time for each node.

### Strategy

1. **Tree Representation**:
    - Create an adjacency list from the given edges.

2. **Recursive DFS Traversal**:
    - Perform a Depth First Search (DFS) traversal from the root node (node `0`).
    - At each node, compute the maximum accumulated time needed to mark its subtree.

3. **Computation**:
    - The time to mark a node would be the sum of its marking time plus the maximum time required to mark its children (since we can mark multiple nodes in parallel, we care about the maximum depth of the marking process starting from the root).

### Code

```python
def minTimeToMarkAllNodes(n, edges, time):
    from collections import defaultdict
    import sys

    # Adjacency List to represent the tree
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    
    for u, v in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    # To avoid revisiting nodes
    visited = [False] * n
    
    def dfs(node):
        visited[node] = True
        
        # Base case: A leaf node
        if not tree[node]: 
            return time[node]
        
        max_time = 0
        
        for neighbor in tree[node]:
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                max_time = max(max_time, dfs(neighbor))
        
        return time[node] + max_time
    
    # Return the time required to mark from the root node (0)
    return dfs(0)

# Example Usage
n = 7
edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4], [2, 5], [2, 6]]
time = [0, 2, 4, 3, 5, 8, 7]

print(minTimeToMarkAllNodes(n, edges, time))  # Example Output
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is as follows:
- **Tree Representation**: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of edges.
- **DFS Traversal**: `O(n)` to visit all nodes once.
Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.

This solution will efficiently compute the minimal time to mark all nodes in the tree, considering marking constraints.
