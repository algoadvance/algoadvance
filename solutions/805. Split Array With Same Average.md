title:  Split Array With Same Average-out
permalink: /s805
---

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`. Split this array into two parts where the average of both parts is the same. 

Return `true` if it is possible to achieve that and `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the numbers in the array all integers?**
   - Yes.
2. **Can the two parts be empty?**
   - No, both parts must consist of at least one element.
3. **Is there a constraint on the size of the array?**
   - Yes, the size varies but usually is manageable within typical bounds for such problems in LeetCode.
4. **Can the parts overlap or are we looking for a partition?**
   - The parts cannot overlap; it's a strict partition.

### Strategy

1. **Average Relationship**:
    - The average of an array is found by taking the sum of the elements divided by the number of elements.
    - To split the array into parts with the same average, the sums of the two parts must be proportional to their sizes.

2. **Mathematical Insight**:
    - For the average of two parts to be the same, the equation `sum(A_elem) / len(A_elem) = sum(B_elem) / len(B_elem)` must hold.
    - This reduces to the condition: `sum(A_elem) * len(B_elem) = sum(B_elem) * len(A_elem)`.
  
3. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
    - Use subsets sums to try and find possible valid splits.
    - Maintain a set of possible sums for subsets up to the current element.

### Code

```python
from itertools import combinations
from math import gcd
from functools import lru_cache

def splitArraySameAverage(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    total_sum = sum(nums)
    
    # This problem becomes more accessible in terms of complexity
    # if we translate it into pair of sets with desired lengths
    
    # gcd to reduce the fraction sum_nums/n
    for length in range(1, n // 2 + 1):
        if (total_sum * length) % n == 0:
            target_sum = total_sum * length // n
            if subset_sum_possible(nums, length, target_sum):
                return True
    return False

@lru_cache(None)
def subset_sum_possible(nums, length, target):
    # Basic case
    if length == 0:
        return target == 0
    if length > len(nums):
        return False
    
    last = nums[-1]
    rest = nums[:-1]

    # Either include the last element in the subset (then target would become target-last)
    # or don't include it (length remains length)
    return subset_sum_possible(rest, length - 1, target - last) or subset_sum_possible(rest, length, target)

# Example Usage
# nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
# print(splitArraySameAverage(nums)) # Output should be True
```

### Strategy Recap

1. **Initialization**:
    - Calculate the total sum and length of the array.

2. **Fraction Condition**:
    - Use the condition derived from the average relationship to identify valid lengths of subsets to be considered.
    - For each valid length, check if a valid subset with the required sum can be formed using `subset_sum_possible`.

3. **Memoization**:
    - Utilize memoization to store results of subproblems for better efficiency.

### Time Complexity

- The worst case time complexity is `O(N * 2^N/2)` due to the exponential nature of subset sum checks. However, with memoization and pruning, this is often much faster in practice. Thus, for moderate-sized arrays, this solution is feasible.

This approach leverages combinatorial nature and mathematical properties to ensure we check fewer potential splits, thereby optimizing performance.
