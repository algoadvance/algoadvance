title:  Apple Redistribution into Boxes-out
permalink: /s3074

You are given an integer array `apples` of length `n`, where `apples[i]` represents the number of apples in the `i-th` box. 

Your goal is to make all the boxes have the same number of apples by performing the following operations any number of times:

- Choose a box with a non-zero number of apples.
- Choose another box.
- Move one apple from the first box to the second box.

Return `true` if you can achieve this goal, and `false` otherwise.

### Example
- Example 1:

    ```
    Input: apples = [2, 5, 3, 9]
    Output: False
    Explanation: It is not possible to make all the boxes have the same number of apples.
    ```

- Example 2:

    ```
    Input: apples = [3, 3, 3]
    Output: True
    Explanation: All boxes already contain the same number of apples.
    ```

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of the length of the `apples` array?
2. What is the range of the number of apples in each box?
3. Can the array have negative or zero values?

To simplify, let's assume:
1. 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 (length of the apples array).
2. 0 ≤ apples[i] ≤ 10^9 (number of apples in each box).

## Strategy

To solve this problem, consider the following steps:

1. Compute the total number of apples.
2. Check if the total number of apples is divisible by the length of the array `n`.
3. If divisible, it means we can redistribute the apples equally into each box.
4. If not, return `false` since we cannot evenly distribute apples into each box.

### Prove of Conditions
- If the total number of apples is divisible by `n`, it means we can evenly distribute them. (Total sum modulo the number of boxes should equal 0).

## Time Complexity
- Calculating the sum of the array takes O(n) time.
 
## Code

Here's a Python function to implement the aforementioned strategy:

```python
def canRedistributeApples(apples):
    total_apples = sum(apples)
    n = len(apples)
    
    # Check if the total number of apples is divisible by the number of boxes
    if total_apples % n == 0:
        return True
    else:
        return False

# Test case
print(canRedistributeApples([2, 5, 3, 9])) # Output: False
print(canRedistributeApples([3, 3, 3]))    # Output: True
```

### Explanation:
- Calculate the total number of apples using `sum(apples)`.
- Calculate the length of the array, `n`, using `len(apples)`.
- Check if `total_apples` is divisible by `n`.
- Return `true` if divisible, otherwise `false`.

This algorithm runs in O(n) time where `n` is the length of the input list `apples`, which is efficient for the given constraints.
