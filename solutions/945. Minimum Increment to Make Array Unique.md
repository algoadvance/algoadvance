title:  Minimum Increment to Make Array Unique-out
permalink: /s945
---
Given an array of integers `arr`, you need to ensure that all elements in the array are unique by incrementing any number of elements as many times as necessary. Return the minimum number of increments needed to make all array elements unique.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the input array contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the input can contain negative numbers.
2. **Is there a constraint on the size of the array?**
   - The number of elements in the array (`n`) is between 1 and 100,000.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to ensure each number in the array is unique with as few increments as possible. Here's a clear strategy:

1. **Sort the Array**:
   - Sorting will help us sequentially compare numbers and make sure no two consecutive numbers are the same.
   
2. **Iterate Over the Sorted Array**:
   - Compare each number with the previous one. If a number is found to be less than or equal to the previous number, it needs to be incremented to be one more than the previous number to maintain uniqueness.

3. **Count Increments**:
   - Keep track of the total number of increments needed.

### Code
Here is the Python code to achieve the solution:

```python
def minIncrementForUnique(arr):
    # Sorting the array first
    arr.sort()
    
    increments = 0
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] <= arr[i - 1]:
            # Calculate the necessary increment
            increment = arr[i - 1] - arr[i] + 1
            # Increment the current number to make it unique
            arr[i] += increment
            # Add to the total increment count
            increments += increment
    
    return increments
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: `O(n log n)` where `n` is the length of the array.
- **Iteration**: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the array.

Hence, the overall time complexity of the solution is `O(n log n)` because the sorting dominates the iteration step.

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Sorting**:
   - We start by sorting the array to make it easier to handle duplicates.
2. **Iterating and Adjusting**:
   - We then iterate through the sorted array starting from the second element.
   - For each element, if it is less than or equal to the previous element, it means it's not unique, and we will increment it to make it unique.
   - We calculate the necessary increment and apply it to the current element.
   - We also accumulate these increments to obtain the minimum number needed.

This approach guarantees that all elements in the array will become unique with the minimum number of increments.
