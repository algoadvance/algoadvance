title:  Reverse Subarray To Maximize Array Value-out
permalink: /s1330
---

You are given an integer array `nums`. The **value** of this array is defined as the sum of `|nums[i] - nums[i+1]|` for all `0 <= i < nums.length - 1`.

You are allowed to select any subarray of the given array and reverse it. Return the maximum possible value of the array's value after reversing exactly one subarray.

#### Example:
```python
Input: nums = [2, 3, 1, 5, 4]
Output: 10
Explanation: By reversing the subarray [3, 1], the array becomes [2, 1, 3, 5, 4].
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the subarray selected for reversal be the entire array?
2. Are there any constraints on the size of the array `nums`?
3. Are all elements in `nums` unique?

### Code

```python
def maxValueAfterReverse(nums):
    total = 0
    n = len(nums)
    
    for i in range(n - 1):
        total += abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1])
    
    max_increase = 0
    
    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        max_increase = max(max_increase, abs(nums[0] - nums[i + 1]) - abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]))
        max_increase = max(max_increase, abs(nums[-1] - nums[i - 1]) - abs(nums[i] - nums[i - 1]))
    
    for i in range(n - 1):
        max_increase = max(max_increase, abs(nums[i + 1] - nums[0]) - abs(nums[i + 1] - nums[i]))
        max_increase = max(max_increase, abs(nums[-1] - nums[i]) - abs(nums[i + 1] - nums[i]))
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_increase = max(max_increase,
                           abs(nums[i - 1] - nums[(i + 1) % n]) - abs(nums[i - 1] - nums[i]))

    return total + max_increase

# Example Usage
nums = [2, 3, 1, 5, 4]
print(maxValueAfterReverse(nums))  # Output: 10
```

### Strategy

1. **Initial Calculation**: Calculate the initial sum of the absolute differences between consecutive elements.
2. **Analyze potential increase**: Iterate over possible subarrays to reverse:
   - By reversing elements between different boundaries of the array, determine how much the differences could change and thus, how much the total value can be increased.
3. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - Reversal could affect the array by the largest margin if it involves one or more extremum elements.
4. **Updating Maximum Value**: Maintain and update the maximum possible increase in the array value.

### Time Complexity

- **Initial Calculation**: `O(n)` to sum up the initial differences.
- **Iterating Potential Reversals**: `O(n)` complexity to find and calculate the maximum increase by checking possible subarrays.
  
Overall Time Complexity is **O(n)**.
