title:  Sum of Scores of Built Strings-out
permalink: /s2223
---

You are given a string `s` of lowercase English letters. A string `t` is a "built string" of `s` if `t` is a non-empty substring of the infinite concatenation of `s`, i.e., `t` is a substring of `s + s + s + ...`. Return the sum of scores of all `built strings` `t`. The score of a string `t` is the number of distinct non-empty substrings in `t`.

#### Example

- Example 1:
  ```
  Input: s = "abc"
  Output: 10
  Explanation:
  Substrings are: "a", "ab", "abc", "b", "bc", "c"
  Distinct substrings => 6 total substrings
  And substrings like "aa", "ab", when considering infinite concatenation can increase the total count of substrings
  ```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Is the string `s` composed only of lowercase English letters?
   - **A:** Yes.
2. **Q:** Are we interested in built strings of `s` up to a certain length?
   - **A:** All possible lengths should be considered.
3. **Q:** Do substrings in the infinite concatenation context mean we consider overlaps due to wrapping around the original string `s`?
   - **A:** Yes, built strings can wrap over the end of `s` and start again from the beginning.

### Strategy

1. **Suffices and LCP Array:** We will use suffix arrays and longest common prefix (LCP) arrays to compute the number of distinct substrings efficiently.
2. **KMP Algorithm:** We can leverage the Knuth-Morris-Pratt string matching algorithm to extend this to infinite concatenation scenarios.
3. **Dynamic Programming:** For large strings and infinite concatenation, we may use a dynamic programming approach to handle the score calculation efficiently.

### Code

```python
def get_suffix_array(s):
    n = len(s)
    suffixes = sorted((s[i:], i) for i in range(n))
    suffix_array = [suffix[1] for suffix in suffixes]
    return suffix_array

def get_lcp_array(s, suffix_array):
    n = len(s)
    rank = [0] * n
    lcp = [0] * (n - 1)
    
    for i, suffix in enumerate(suffix_array):
        rank[suffix] = i
    
    h = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if rank[i] > 0:
            j = suffix_array[rank[i] - 1]
            while i + h < n and j + h < n and s[i + h] == s[j + h]:
                h += 1
            lcp[rank[i] - 1] = h
            if h > 0:
                h -= 1
    
    return lcp

def sum_scores_of_built_strings(s: str) -> int:
    n = len(s)
    s2 = s + s
    suffix_array = get_suffix_array(s2)
    lcp_array = get_lcp_array(s2, suffix_array)
    
    score_sum = 0
    max_len = 2 * n - 1

    for i in range(len(suffix_array)):
        if suffix_array[i] < n:
            max_prefix_len = min(n, max_len - suffix_array[i])
            score = max_prefix_len * (max_prefix_len + 1) // 2
            
            for j in range(i + 1, len(lcp_array)):
                if lcp_array[j] == 0 or suffix_array[j] >= n:
                    break
                lcp_val = lcp_array[j]
                score -= (lcp_val * (lcp_val + 1)) // 2
                
            score_sum += score
    
    return score_sum

# Example Usage:
s = "abc"
print(sum_scores_of_built_strings(s))  # Expected output example
```

### Time Complexity

- Constructing the suffix array has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string \(s\).
- Computing the LCP array also takes \(O(n)\).
- Calculating the scores involves processing the built strings, which will be within \(O(n^2)\) in the worst case due to the nature of possible overlaps.

Hence, the overall time complexity is dominated by the suffix array construction and LCP array computation, making it \(O(n \log n)\).
