Given the head of a linked list and a value `x`, partition it such that all nodes less than `x` come before nodes greater than or equal to `x`.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

For example:
```
Input: head = [1,4,3,2,5,2], x = 3
Output: [1,2,2,4,3,5]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should we do with equal values to `x`?**
   - We should place them in the part of the list that contains the nodes greater than or equal to `x`.
2. **Are there any constraints on the values in the list?**
   - The values are generally within the range of typical integer values.
3. **How do we handle an empty list?**
   - Simply return an empty list.

### Strategy
We will use two separate lists (or linked lists) to partition the given linked list: 
- One list (`before`) will store all nodes with values less than `x`.
- Another list (`after`) will store nodes with values greater than or equal to `x`.

We will maintain two pointers for each partitioned list (`before_head`, `before_tail` and `after_head`, `after_tail`) to facilitate efficient appending.

Steps:
1. Traverse the original list.
2. Append nodes to either the `before` list or the `after` list based on the node's value.
3. Combine the two lists by setting the `next` pointer of the last node of the `before` list to the first node of the `after` list.
4. The head of the `before` list will be the new head of the modified list.

### Code
```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def partition(head: ListNode, x: int) -> ListNode:
    if not head:
        return head
    
    before_head = ListNode(0)
    before_tail = before_head
    after_head = ListNode(0)
    after_tail = after_head

    current = head
    while current:
        if current.val < x:
            before_tail.next = current
            before_tail = before_tail.next
        else:
            after_tail.next = current
            after_tail = after_tail.next
        current = current.next

    # Terminate `after` list to prevent potential cycles
    after_tail.next = None

    # Combine partitioned lists
    before_tail.next = after_head.next
    
    return before_head.next
```

### Time Complexity
The solution traverses the list once to partition it, which results in a time complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list. The space complexity is `O(1)` excluding the space needed for the output linked list, since we are only using a fixed number of additional pointers.
