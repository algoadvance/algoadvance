title:  Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal-out
permalink: /s106
---

Given two integer arrays `inorder` and `postorder` where `inorder` is the inorder traversal of a binary tree and `postorder` is the postorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: inorder = [9,3,15,20,7], postorder = [9,15,7,20,3]
Output: [3,9,20,null,null,15,7]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: inorder = [-1], postorder = [-1]
Output: [-1]
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= inorder.length <= 3000`
- `postorder.length == inorder.length`
- `-3000 <= inorder[i], postorder[i] <= 3000`
- `inorder` and `postorder` consist of **unique** values.
- Each value of `postorder` also appears in `inorder`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are duplicates allowed in the input arrays?
   - **A:** No, both `inorder` and `postorder` consist of unique values.

2. **Q:** Should we assume that the input arrays are valid and represent a binary tree?
   - **A:** Yes, the input arrays are always valid and represent a binary tree.

3. **Q:** What should be returned?
   - **A:** We should return the root of the constructed binary tree.

### Strategy

To build the binary tree from inorder and postorder traversals, we can use the following strategy:

1. **Identify the root:** The last element in the `postorder` list is the root of the tree.
2. **Partition the inorder list:** Once the root is identified, partition the `inorder` list into left and right subtrees using the root's index.
3. **Recursively construct subtrees:** Use the partitions of the `inorder` list to recursively construct the left and right subtrees.

Steps:
1. Create a mapping from values to their indices in the `inorder` array to quickly locate the root and partition indices.
2. Recursively build the tree by popping elements from the end of the `postorder` list and partitioning the `inorder` array accordingly.

### Code

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def buildTree(inorder, postorder):
    if not inorder or not postorder:
        return None

    # Mapping of inorder values to their indices for quick lookup
    inorder_index_map = {value: idx for idx, value in enumerate(inorder)}
    
    def helper(in_left, in_right):
        if in_left > in_right:
            return None
        
        # The last element in postorder is the root of the current tree
        root_val = postorder.pop()
        root = TreeNode(root_val)
        
        # Split the inorder list into left and right subtrees
        index = inorder_index_map[root_val]
        
        # Recursively construct the right subtree
        root.right = helper(index + 1, in_right)
        # Recursively construct the left subtree
        root.left = helper(in_left, index - 1)
        
        return root

    # Start with the full range of the inorder list
    return helper(0, len(inorder) - 1)

# Example Usage
inorder = [9, 3, 15, 20, 7]
postorder = [9, 15, 7, 20, 3]
tree = buildTree(inorder, postorder)
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - Each node is processed exactly once.
  - Building the index map of the inorder array is O(n).
  - Recursively constructing the tree for each element is O(n).

- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - The space used for the index map is O(n).
  - The recursion stack could go as deep as the tree height which, in the worst case (like a skewed tree), is O(n).
