### 1593. Split a String Into the Max Number of Unique Substrings

Given a string `s`, you need to split it into the maximum number of unique substrings, and return the number of unique substrings.

### Example
1. Input: `s = "ababccc"`
   - Output: 5
   - Explanation: One way to split it into 5 unique substrings is "a", "b", "ab", "c", "cc". Another way is to split it into "a", "b", "c", "ab", "cc".

2. Input: `s = "aba"`
   - Output: 2
   - Explanation: One way to split it into 2 unique substrings is "a", "ba".

3. Input: `s = "aa"`
   - Output: 1
   - Explanation: The only way to split it is "a", "a".

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the substrings overlap? 
   - No, substrings must be non-overlapping.
2. Are there any constraints on the length of the string `s`?
   - The string length can be up to 16, thus our approach should handle reasonably small strings directly.

## Strategy

1. **Backtracking Approach**:
    - We will use backtracking to explore all possible ways to split the string.
    - Maintain a set to keep track of unique substrings.
    - At each step, try to partition the string at different points and check if the resulting substring is unique.

2. **Recursive Function**:
    - Use a helper function that takes the current starting index and a set of used substrings.
    - Try to add each possible substring (from the current index to the end of the string) to the set and backtrack.

3. **Find Maximum Count**:
    - During the backtracking process, keep track of the maximum number of unique substrings.

This method leverages the relatively small size of the string (max length 16), allowing us to use a backtracking approach efficiently.

## Time Complexity
- The worst-case time complexity will be `O(2^n)` due to the nature of checking every possible partition against the set of unique substrings, but the solution space is pruned due to early termination when a duplicate substring is found.

## Code

```python
def maxUniqueSplit(s: str) -> int:
    def backtrack(start, seen):
        if start == len(s):
            return 0
        
        max_splits = 0
        for end in range(start + 1, len(s) + 1):
            substr = s[start:end]
            if substr not in seen:
                seen.add(substr)
                max_splits = max(max_splits, 1 + backtrack(end, seen))
                seen.remove(substr)
        
        return max_splits
    
    return backtrack(0, set())
```

This code employs a recursive backtracking approach to explore all possible splits of the input string `s`, ensuring each substring in a split is unique and ultimately returning the maximum count of such substrings.
