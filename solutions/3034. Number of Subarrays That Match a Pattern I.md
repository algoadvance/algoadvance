title:  Number of Subarrays That Match a Pattern I-out
permalink: /s3034

### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `arr` and an integer pattern_length, count the number of subarrays in `arr` that contain exactly `pattern_length` unique integers.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is `pattern_length` guaranteed to be less than or equal to the length of `arr`?** 
   This affects whether we need to handle edge cases where `pattern_length` might be larger than the array itself.
2. **Are there any constraints on the values within `arr` and `pattern_length`?** 
   This helps us understand how efficient our solution needs to be.
3. **Should the subarrays be contiguous?** 
   Generally, subarrays are contiguous, but this should be confirmed.
4. **Can the integers in `arr` be negative or non-integer?** 
   This could impact how we handle the elements and ensure the solution's correctness.

Let's assume:
- `pattern_length` is always less than or equal to the length of `arr`.
- The values in `arr` are integers.
- Subarrays are contiguous.
- Integers can be negative or positive.

### Strategy
To solve this, we can use the sliding window approach with a hashmap to keep track of the unique integers in the current window. 

1. **Initialize two pointers**, `start` and `end`, both set to the beginning of the array.
2. **Use a hashmap** to keep count of the elements in the current window.
3. **Expand the window** by moving the `end` pointer, and update the hashmap.
4. When the window has exactly `pattern_length` unique integers, **count this subarray**, and then **move the `start` pointer** to try and find the next subarray while maintaining exactly `pattern_length` unique integers.

### Code
```python
from collections import defaultdict

def count_subarrays_with_pattern_length(arr, pattern_length):
    start = 0
    end = 0
    count = 0
    unique_count = 0
    freq = defaultdict(int)
    
    while end < len(arr):
        if freq[arr[end]] == 0:
            unique_count += 1
        freq[arr[end]] += 1
        end += 1
        
        while unique_count > pattern_length:
            freq[arr[start]] -= 1
            if freq[arr[start]] == 0:
                unique_count -= 1
            start += 1
        
        if unique_count == pattern_length:
            count += end - start
    
    return count

# Example usage
arr = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]
pattern_length = 2
print(count_subarrays_with_pattern_length(arr, pattern_length))  # Example output
``` 

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the array. 
- The `start` and `end` pointers each move at most N steps.
- In each step, updating the hashmap takes constant time O(1).

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: Two pointers (`start` and `end`) and a hashmap for frequency counts.
- **Expand window**: Increment the `end` pointer, update the hashmap, and increase `unique_count` when a new integer is encountered.
- **Shrink window**: While `unique_count` exceeds `pattern_length`, increment the `start` pointer and update the hashmap (decreasing `unique_count` when an integer's count drops to zero).
- **Count subarrays**: Whenever `unique_count` matches `pattern_length`, count the current subarray and continue checking.

This approach ensures we efficiently track and count subarrays while maintaining the constraint of exactly `pattern_length` unique integers.
