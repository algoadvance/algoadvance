title:  Minimum Operations to Make Binary Array Elements Equal to One I-out
permalink: /s3191
---

You need to find the minimum number of operations to make all elements in a binary array equal to one. You can perform the following operation any number of times: choose two adjacent elements and change them both to one if they are not already one.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the length of the binary array?
   - Are the operations free, or do they have some associated cost or limitation?
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - Are we guaranteed that the initial array will contain at least one `1`, or can it be entirely composed of `0`s?

Assuming the initial array contains a mix of `0`s and `1`s, we can proceed with the implementation.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to transform all the `0`s to `1`s by repeatedly applying the specified operation. Here’s the plan:
1. Traverse the array and find the segments of consecutive zeros.
2. Note down the length of each segment.
3. Calculate the minimum number of operations required to convert each segment of zeros to ones.
   - For a segment of length `n`, the minimum number of operations to convert it to ones is ⌈n/2⌉ (ceil of n divided by 2).

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this algorithm will be O(n) where n is the length of the array since we only need to traverse the array once to count the segments of zeros.

Now, let's write the code.

## Code

```python
import math

def min_operations_to_make_all_ones(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    
    operations = 0
    i = 0
    
    while i < n:
        if arr[i] == 0:
            # Start of a segment of zeros
            zero_segment_length = 0
            
            while i < n and arr[i] == 0:
                zero_segment_length += 1
                i += 1
                
            # Increment the operations by the number of operations required to convert this segment
            operations += math.ceil(zero_segment_length / 2)
        else:
            i += 1
    
    return operations

# Example usage
arr = [0, 0, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
print(min_operations_to_make_all_ones(arr))  # Output: Expected minimum operations to make all elements 1
```

By counting and computing the operations required for each segment of continuous `0`s, we efficiently determine the minimum number of operations needed to make all elements `1` in the binary array.
