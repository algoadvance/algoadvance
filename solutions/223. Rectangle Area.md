title:  Rectangle Area-out
permalink: /s223
---
You are given the coordinates of two **rectilinear** rectangles in a 2D plane. The first rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (A, B) and its top-right corner (C, D), while the second rectangle is defined by its bottom-left corner (E, F) and its top-right corner (G, H).

Write a function to compute the total area covered by both rectangles.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: A = -3, B = 0, C = 3, D = 4, E = 0, F = -1, G = 9, H = 2
Output: 45
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: A = -2, B = -2, C = 2, D = 2, E = -2, F = -2, G = 2, H = 2
Output: 16
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be done if the rectangles overlap?**
   - Subtract the area of the overlapping region from the sum of the areas of the two rectangles.

2. **Are the rectangle coordinates always integers?**
   - Yes.

3. **Can the rectangle be degenerate (line or point)?**
   - No. Assume valid rectangles with positive area.

## Strategy
1. **Calculate the Area of Each Rectangle Separately:**
   - Area1 = (C - A) * (D - B)
   - Area2 = (G - E) * (H - F)

2. **Calculate the Area of the Overlapping Rectangle, if any:**
   - The overlapping region, if it exists, will be a rectangle.
   - Determine the coordinates of this overlapping rectangle:
     - Left boundary: max(A, E)
     - Right boundary: min(C, G)
     - Bottom boundary: max(B, F)
     - Top boundary: min(D, H)

3. **Validate if These Boundaries Form a Valid Rectangle:**
   - If the right boundary is to the left of the left boundary (or equal), or the top boundary is below the bottom boundary (or equal), there is no overlap.

4. **Calculate the Total Area:**
   - Total area = Area1 + Area2 - Overlap Area (if there is an overlap).

## Code

```python
def compute_area(A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H):
    # Calculate area of the first rectangle
    area1 = (C - A) * (D - B)
    
    # Calculate area of the second rectangle
    area2 = (G - E) * (H - F)
    
    # Calculate the overlap boundaries
    overlap_left = max(A, E)
    overlap_right = min(C, G)
    overlap_bottom = max(B, F)
    overlap_top = min(D, H)
    
    # Initialize overlap area
    overlap_area = 0
    
    # Check if the overlap forms a valid rectangle
    if overlap_left < overlap_right and overlap_bottom < overlap_top:
        overlap_area = (overlap_right - overlap_left) * (overlap_top - overlap_bottom)
    
    # Calculate the total area
    total_area = area1 + area2 - overlap_area
    
    return total_area

# Example use cases
print(compute_area(-3, 0, 3, 4, 0, -1, 9, 2))  # Output: 45
print(compute_area(-2, -2, 2, 2, -2, -2, 2, 2))  # Output: 16
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(1) because it involves a constant number of arithmetic operations and comparisons regardless of the input values.
