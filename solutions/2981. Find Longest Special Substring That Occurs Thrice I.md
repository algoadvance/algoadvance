title:  Find Longest Special Substring That Occurs Thrice I-out
permalink: /s2981
---

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest special substring that occurs at least three times in `s`. A "special substring" is any non-empty substring that appears multiple times in `s`.

### Clarifying Questions

To ensure we understand the problem correctly:

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What are the constraints on the length of the string `s`?
   - What kind of characters can `s` contain?

2. **Output Details**:
   - If no such substring exists, what should be returned? (Assuming it should return `0` because there is no special substring that meets the condition.)

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can approach it using binary search combined with a hash-based technique to efficiently check for the occurrence of substrings.

**Steps:**

1. **Binary Search on Length**:
   - We'll use binary search to find the maximum length of the substring that appears at least three times.
   - The lower bound for the search will be 1, and the upper bound will be the length of the string.

2. **Rabin-Karp Algorithm**:
   - For each length of the substring determined by binary search, use the Rabin-Karp algorithm to find if any substring of this length appears at least thrice.
   - Rabin-Karp allows us to hash substrings efficiently and compare them.

3. **Hash Set for Substrings**:
   - Use a hash set to maintain and check the frequency of substrings of the current length efficiently.

### Code

```python
def longest_special_substring(s):
    from collections import defaultdict

    def search(L):
        """ A Rabin-Karp based function to find if there's any special substring 
            of length L that appears at least 3 times."""
        n = len(s)
        if L > n:
            return False

        # Base value for the rolling hash function
        a = 256
        # A large prime number to mod the hash value
        modulus = 2**63 - 1

        # Compute the hash of the first L-length substring
        curr_hash = 0
        for i in range(L):
            curr_hash = (curr_hash * a + ord(s[i])) % modulus

        # Store the hash and count of occurrence
        hashes = defaultdict(int)
        hashes[curr_hash] = 1

        # Precompute a**L % modulus for roll hash computation
        aL = pow(a, L, modulus)

        for start in range(1, n - L + 1):
            curr_hash = (curr_hash * a - ord(s[start - 1]) * aL + ord(s[start + L - 1])) % modulus
            if curr_hash in hashes:
                hashes[curr_hash] += 1
                if hashes[curr_hash] >= 3:
                    return True
            else:
                hashes[curr_hash] = 1

        return False

    # Binary search for the maximum length
    l, r = 1, len(s)
    res = 0
    
    while l <= r:
        mid = (l + r) // 2
        if search(mid):
            res = mid
            l = mid + 1
        else:
            r = mid - 1

    return res

# Example usage:
s = "banana"
print(longest_special_substring(s))  # Output: 0, assuming no substring occurs thrice in "banana"
```

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search**: `O(log n)`, where `n` is the length of the string.
- **Rabin-Karp Search**: For each length `L`, the hashing and checking take `O(n)` time.
- Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.

This solution is efficient and handles the problem within reasonable constraints for typical input sizes expected in coding interviews.
