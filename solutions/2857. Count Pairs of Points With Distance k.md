title:  Count Pairs of Points With Distance k-out
permalink: /s2857
---

You are given an integer `k` and a 2D integer array `points` where each `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the X-Y plane. Return the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and the Euclidean distance between `points[i]` and `points[j]` is equal to `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of `k`?
   - What are the constraints on the coordinates of the points and the number of points?

2. **Distance Calculation:**
   - Should the distance be an exact integer or can it be a floating-point number?
   - Are negative coordinates allowed?

3. **Output:**
   - Should the number of valid pairs be returned as an integer?

Assuming typical constraints:
- \( 0 \leq k \leq 10^4 \)
- Points have integer coordinates and are within the range that a common integer variable can store.
- Count pairs where Euclidean distance is exactly `k`.

## Strategy

1. **Euclidean Distance Formula:**
   - Euclidean distance \( d \) between two points \( (x1, y1) \) and \( (x2, y2) \) is given by:
     \[
     d = \sqrt{(x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2}
     \]
   - For this distance to be exactly `k`, the equation modifies to:
     \[
     (x2 - x1)^2 + (y2 - y1)^2 = k^2
     \]
   - This means we need to check all pairs of points and see if this condition is met.

2. **Brute Force Approach:**
   - Iterate through all pairs of points using two nested loops.
   - For each pair, check if they satisfy the distance condition.
   - Count and return the number of valid pairs.

## Code

```python
import math
from typing import List

def count_pairs(points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    k_squared = k * k
    n = len(points)
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            (x1, y1), (x2, y2) = points[i], points[j]
            distance_squared = (x2 - x1) ** 2 + (y2 - y1) ** 2
            if distance_squared == k_squared:
                count += 1
    
    return count
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this approach is \( O(n^2) \), where `n` is the number of points. This is due to the nested loops required to evaluate each pair of points.

- **Space Complexity:** \( O(1) \). We are only using a few extra variables for counting and distance calculation.

This approach should work efficiently within the typical constraints of competitive programming problems where `n` is around \( 10^4 \) or lower. For larger inputs, more optimized algorithms (such as spatial data structures) might be necessary.
