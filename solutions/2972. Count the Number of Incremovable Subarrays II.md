title:  Count the Number of Incremovable Subarrays II-out
permalink: /s2972
---
You are given an array `nums` of integers and an integer `k`. A subarray is defined as a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array. A subarray is called "incremovable" if the maximum number of `k` consecutive elements within the subarray is no more than the minimum number of `k` consecutive elements within the subarray. 

Your task is to count the number of incremovable subarrays in `nums`.

### Example
- Input: `nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2]`, `k = 2`
- Output: `3`

### Note
In this example, the incremovable subarrays of length `2` are `[1, 2]`, `[2, 1]`, and `[1, 3]`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the size of the array `nums` and the value of `k`?** 
   - The constraints typically determine which algorithms will be efficient enough.
 
2. **Can we assume `nums` and `k` are always valid (for example, `k` will always be â‰¤ length of `nums`)?** 
   - These assumptions can simplify the implementation details.
 
3. **Should the subarrays be of exactly `k` length?**
   - Seems like the problem requires checking subarrays of fixed length `k`.

### Strategy
1. **Brute Force Approach**:
   - We can use a brute force approach to calculate this by sliding a window of size `k` over the array and checking the conditions.
   
2. **Sliding Window For Efficiency**:
   - We scan through the array creating windows of length `k` and check the condition of the maximum and minimum values within each window. If within any window this condition holds true, we will count it as an incremovable subarray.

3. **Using Deques for Sliding Window Minimum and Maximum**:
   - To efficiently calculate the minimum and maximum in the sliding window of size `k`, we can use two deques (double-ended queues).

### Code
Here is the implementation of this strategy:

```python
from collections import deque

def count_incremovable_subarrays(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    if k > n:
        return 0

    incremovable_count = 0

    # Create two deques for finding min and max in sliding window
    min_deque = deque()
    max_deque = deque()

    for i in range(n):
        # Maintain deque for minimum in window
        while min_deque and min_deque[-1] > nums[i]:
            min_deque.pop()
        min_deque.append(nums[i])

        # Maintain deque for maximum in window
        while max_deque and max_deque[-1] < nums[i]:
            max_deque.pop()
        max_deque.append(nums[i])

        # Remove elements out of current window
        if i >= k:
            if min_deque[0] == nums[i - k]:
                min_deque.popleft()
            if max_deque[0] == nums[i - k]:
                max_deque.popleft()

        # Check the condition when we have a full window
        if i >= k - 1:
            if max_deque[0] <= min_deque[0]:
                incremovable_count += 1

    return incremovable_count

# Example usage
nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 2]
k = 2
print(count_incremovable_subarrays(nums, k))  # Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity
- **Deque operations**: Each element is added and removed from the deque at most once, so this results in O(n) operations.
- **Overall Complexity**: The overall complexity of this approach is O(n), making it efficient even for larger input sizes.

This solution uses a sliding window technique with the help of double-ended queues to keep track of the minimum and maximum values efficiently within each window of size `k`.
