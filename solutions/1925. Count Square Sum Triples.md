title:  Count Square Sum Triples-out

Given a positive integer `n`, return the number of triplets `(a, b, c)` such that `1 <= a, b, c <= n` and `a^2 + b^2 = c^2`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Range of `n`**: What is the typical or maximum value of `n` we can expect? This helps us optimize our code accordingly.
2. **Constraints**: Are there any specific constraints like time or space complexity limits?
3. **Triplets Order**: Should triplets be distinct (i.e., `(a, b, c)` is the same as `(b, a, c)`) or do we count both?
  
For this problem, the primary task is to clearly identify and count the Pythagorean triplets within the given range.

### Strategy:
1. **Iterate Over Possible Values**: Use three nested loops to iterate over all possible values of `a`, `b`, and `c` since the constraints average-case scenario involves a relatively small range of numbers.
2. **Check Pythagorean Triplets**: For each combination of `a`, `b`, and `c`, check if the condition `a^2 + b^2 == c^2` holds.
3. **Count Valid Triplets**: Increment a counter each time a valid triplet is found.

### Code:
```python
def countSquareSumTriples(n: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n+1):
        for b in range(1, n+1):
            c2 = a*a + b*b
            c = int(c2**0.5)
            if c*c == c2 and c <= n:
                count += 1
    return count
```

### Explanation:
1. **Variables**:
   - `count` is used to keep track of the number of valid triplets.
   
2. **Loops**:
   - The outer loop iterates over `a` from `1` to `n`.
   - The middle loop iterates over `b` from `1` to `n`.
   - The variable `c2` represents \( a^2 + b^2 \).
   - The variable `c` is the square root of `c2`.

3. **Checking Condition**:
   - Check if `c` squared equals `c2` (i.e., `c` is an integer).
   - Also, check if `c` is within the allowed range (`1 <= c <= n`).

4. **Counting Valid Triplets**:
   - Increment the counter if both conditions are satisfied.

### Time Complexity:
- The approach uses three nested loops, resulting in a time complexity of \( O(n^2) \).
- Specifically, because the innermost operation (finding \( c \) and checking conditions) is constant time, we simplify the complexity to \( O(n^2) \).

This solution is efficient given the constraints, and the use of Pythonâ€™s inherent mathematical operations makes it straightforward to implement and understand.
