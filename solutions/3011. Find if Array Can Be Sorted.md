title:  Find if Array Can Be Sorted-out
permalink: /s3011
---

You are given an array `nums` consisting of `n` distinct integers. You can perform the following operation exactly once:

Select two indices `i` and `j` (0 â‰¤ i < j < n), then swap the values at `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`.

Return `true` if there is a way to sort the array in non-decreasing order by performing this operation exactly once, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

To fully understand the problem, let's ask a few clarifying questions:

1. **Input Range and Constraints:**
   - What is the size of the array `n`?
   - Are there any constraints on the values of the integers in the array?

2. **Output:**
   - Should the function strictly return a boolean `true` or `false`?

Given the problem statement, it seems you have distinct integer elements, so there will be no duplicates, and the only operation allowed is a single swap between any two elements. 

### Strategy

Here's how we can approach solving this problem:

1. **Initial Check:** 
   - If the array is already sorted, return `true`.

2. **Find Unsorted Pairs:**
   - Identify all pairs `(i, j)` where `nums[i] > nums[j]`.

3. **Single Swap:**
   - If there is more than one such pair, try swapping each identified pair and check if the array can be sorted.

4. **Validation:**
   - After performing the swap, check if the array is sorted.
   - Return `true` if a successful swap is found, otherwise `false`.

### Code

Here is the solution implemented in Python:

```python
def can_sort_with_one_swap(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    
    # If the array is already sorted
    if nums == sorted(nums):
        return True

    # List to hold pairs of indices where elements are out of order
    out_of_order_pairs = []
    
    # Identify out of order pairs
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if nums[i] > nums[i + 1]:
            out_of_order_pairs.append((i, i + 1))
    
    # If the number of out of order pairs is zero, array is already sorted
    if not out_of_order_pairs:
        return True

    # If the number of out of order pairs is exactly one, try swapping
    if len(out_of_order_pairs) == 1:
        i, j = out_of_order_pairs[0]
        nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
        if nums == sorted(nums):
            return True
        else:
            return False

    # If there are more than one out of order pairs, we need a more
    # generalized approach to try swapping all combinations of elements.
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            # Swap i and j and check if the array is sorted
            nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
            if nums == sorted(nums):
                return True
            # Revert the swap
            nums[i], nums[j] = nums[j], nums[i]
    
    return False
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initial Check:** Checking if the array is already sorted takes `O(n log n)`.
- **Finding Unsorted Pairs:** Identifying out-of-order pairs takes `O(n)`.
- **Single Swap Check:** If there is only one pair, checking the sorted state after one swap takes `O(n log n)`.

In the worst-case scenario, we check all combinations of swaps, which takes `O(n^2)` swaps, each involving a check of `O(n log n)`. Therefore, the overall time complexity can be approximated as `O(n^3 log n)`.

If the constraints on `n` are not large (e.g., `n` is in the order of hundreds or low thousands), this approach should be efficient.
