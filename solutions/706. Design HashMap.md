Design a HashMap without using any built-in hash table libraries. Implement the following operations:

- `put(key: int, value: int) -> None`: Insert a `(key, value)` pair into the HashMap. If the `key` already exists, update the corresponding `value`.
- `get(key: int) -> int`: Return the `value` to which the specified `key` is mapped, or `-1` if the HashMap contains no mapping for the `key`.
- `remove(key: int) -> None`: Remove the mapping for the specified `key` if it exists.

**Example:**
```
MyHashMap hashMap = new MyHashMap();
hashMap.put(1, 1);         
hashMap.put(2, 2);         
hashMap.get(1);            // returns 1
hashMap.get(3);            // returns -1 (not found)
hashMap.put(2, 1);         // update the existing value
hashMap.get(2);            // returns 1 
hashMap.remove(2);         // remove the mapping for 2
hashMap.get(2);            // returns -1 (not found) 
```

**Constraints:**
- All keys and values will be in the range of `[0, 10^6]`.
- The number of operations will be in the range of `[1, 10^4]`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can I assume that all keys and values are non-negative integers?
2. Is there any particular constraint on the size of the underlying data structure?

## Strategy

1. **Data Structure**:
   - Use a fixed-size array (bucket array) as the primary container to store the key-value pairs. 
   - Each bucket will itself be a list to handle collisions using chaining.

2. **Hash Function**:
   - Use a simple modulo operation to assign keys to buckets.
   
3. **Operations**:
   - **Put**: Compute the hash index of the key, then iterate through the list in that bucket to check if the key exists. If it does, update the value. If not, append a new `(key, value)` pair.
   - **Get**: Compute the hash index of the key, then iterate through the list in that bucket to find the key. Return the value if found, otherwise return `-1`.
   - **Remove**: Compute the hash index of the key, then iterate through the list in that bucket to find the key. Remove the key-value pair if found.

## Code

```python
class MyHashMap:

    def __init__(self):
        # Define the number of buckets
        self.size = 1000
        self.buckets = [[] for _ in range(self.size)]

    def _hash(self, key: int) -> int:
        return key % self.size

    def put(self, key: int, value: int) -> None:
        hash_key = self._hash(key)
        for idx, (k, v) in enumerate(self.buckets[hash_key]):
            if k == key:
                self.buckets[hash_key][idx] = (key, value)
                return
        self.buckets[hash_key].append((key, value))

    def get(self, key: int) -> int:
        hash_key = self._hash(key)
        for k, v in self.buckets[hash_key]:
            if k == key:
                return v
        return -1

    def remove(self, key: int) -> None:
        hash_key = self._hash(key)
        bucket = self.buckets[hash_key]
        for idx, (k, v) in enumerate(bucket):
            if k == key:
                del bucket[idx]
                return
```

## Time Complexity

- **Put**: O(N/B) on average, where N is the number of keys inserted and B is the number of buckets. In the worst case, it could be O(N) if all keys hash to the same bucket.
- **Get**: O(N/B) on average. In the worst case, it could be O(N).
- **Remove**: O(N/B) on average. In the worst case, it could be O(N).

This design leverages an array of linked lists (or vectors) and provides average constant-time complexity for basic operations, assuming a good hash function and a large enough array.
