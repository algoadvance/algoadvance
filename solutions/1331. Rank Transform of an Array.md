title:  Rank Transform of an Array-out
permalink: /s1331
---
Given an array of integers `arr`, where each integer is not necessarily unique, perform a "rank transform" of the array. The rank of each element is its position in the list of unique values sorted in ascending order. The smallest element receives a rank of 1, the second smallest a rank of 2, and so on.

## Example
- Input: `arr = [40, 10, 20, 30]`
- Output: `[4, 1, 2, 3]`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the values of integers in the array?
   **A:** No, the integers can be any value within the range of typical 32-bit integers.
2. **Q:** If the array is empty, what should be the result?
   **A:** The result should be an empty array.
3. **Q:** Are negative integers allowed?
   **A:** Yes, negative integers are allowed.

## Strategy
1. **Create a sorted list of unique elements from `arr`**:
   - This allows us to determine the rank of each unique element.
2. **Create a mapping from element to its rank**:
   - Iterate through the sorted list and assign ranks starting from 1.
3. **Transform the original array using this mapping**:
   - Replace each element in the original array with its corresponding rank.

## Code

```python
def arrayRankTransform(arr):
    if not arr:
        return []

    # Step 1: Get the sorted list of unique elements
    sorted_unique = sorted(set(arr))

    # Step 2: Create a rank mapping
    rank_map = {val: rank + 1 for rank, val in enumerate(sorted_unique)}

    # Step 3: Transform the original array to its rank representation
    return [rank_map[val] for val in arr]

# Example usage
arr = [40, 10, 20, 30]
print(arrayRankTransform(arr))  # Output: [4, 1, 2, 3]
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is:
1. **O(n log n)** for sorting the unique elements, where `n` is the number of elements in the input array.
2. **O(n)** for creating the rank map and transforming the original array.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)** due to the sorting step. The space complexity is **O(n)** due to the storage of the `rank_map` and the unique sorted values.

If there are further specific constraints or requirements, please let me know!
