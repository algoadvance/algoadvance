LeetCode Problem 1512: **Number of Good Pairs**

Given an array of integers `nums`, a pair `(i, j)` is called good if `nums[i] == nums[j]` and `i < j`. Return the number of good pairs.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1,1,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 good pairs (0,3), (0,4), (3,4), (2,5) because nums[0] == nums[3] == nums[4] and nums[2] == nums[5].
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: Each pair in the array is good.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 0
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the array contain negative numbers or zeros?
    - Yes, as long as they are integers.

2. Is the array sorted?
    - No, the array is not necessarily sorted.

3. What is the maximum size of the input array?
    - The size of the input array can go up to 100.

### Strategy

1. **Count Frequency**: We can use a dictionary to count the frequency of each number in the array.
2. **Calculate Good Pairs**: For each count of a number greater than 1, the number of good pairs can be determined using the combination formula `C(n, 2) = n * (n - 1) / 2`, where `n` is the count of that number.

### Code

```python
def numIdenticalPairs(nums):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Dictionary to store the frequency of each number
    count_dict = defaultdict(int)
    
    # Count the frequency of each number in the array
    for num in nums:
        count_dict[num] += 1
    
    # Calculate the number of good pairs
    good_pairs = 0
    for count in count_dict.values():
        if count > 1:
            good_pairs += (count * (count - 1)) // 2
    
    return good_pairs

# Test Cases
print(numIdenticalPairs([1,2,3,1,1,3]))  # Output: 4
print(numIdenticalPairs([1,1,1,1]))      # Output: 6
print(numIdenticalPairs([1,2,3]))        # Output: 0
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the input array. This is because we traverse the array once to fill the dictionary and another traversal to compute the good pairs based on frequency counts.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the dictionary that stores the frequency of each number.

The provided algorithm effectively calculates the number of good pairs with optimal time and space complexity for the given constraints.
