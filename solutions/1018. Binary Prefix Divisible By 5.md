title:  Binary Prefix Divisible By 5-out
permalink: /s1018
---

You need to implement a function `prefixesDivBy5` that takes a list of binary digits `A` (i.e., a list of values that are either 0 or 1) and returns a list of boolean values. Each boolean value at index `i` indicates whether the binary number represented by the first `i+1` elements of `A` is divisible by 5.

For example, given a list `A = [0, 1, 1]`, the output should be `[True, False, False]` because:
- The binary number represented by the first element `0` is `0` which is divisible by 5.
- The binary number represented by the first two elements `01` is `1` which is not divisible by 5.
- The binary number represented by the first three elements `011` is `3` which is not divisible by 5.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What is the length range of the input list `A`?
   **A:** The input list `A` will have a length between `1` and `30000`.

2. **Q:** Are the elements of the list `A` guaranteed to be binary digits (0 or 1)?
   **A:** Yes, all elements in the list `A` are guaranteed to be either `0` or `1`.

3. **Q:** What should be returned in the case of an empty list?
   **A:** The problem guarantees that the list will have a length of at least 1, so this case does not need to be handled.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. Iterate through the list while constructing the binary number represented by the prefix.
2. Use modular arithmetic to check if the current prefix is divisible by 5.
3. Collect the results in a list and return it.

To avoid handling very large binary numbers directly, we can use the property `(a * 2 + b) % c == (a % c * 2 + b % c) % c` to keep the current number modulo 5. This allows us to manage the size of our intermediate calculations efficiently.

### Steps:
1. Initialize a variable `current_number` to 0.
2. Initialize the result list `result` to an empty list.
3. Iterate through each element of `A`:
   - Update `current_number` using `current_number = (current_number * 2 + digit) % 5`.
   - Append `True` to `result` if `current_number` is 0, otherwise append `False`.
4. Return the `result` list.

## Code
```python
from typing import List

def prefixesDivBy5(A: List[int]) -> List[bool]:
    result = []
    current_number = 0
    for digit in A:
        current_number = (current_number * 2 + digit) % 5
        result.append(current_number == 0)
    return result

# Example usage
A = [0, 1, 1]
print(prefixesDivBy5(A))  # Output: [True, False, False]
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the input list `A`. We only traverse the list once and perform constant time operations for each element.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), for storing the boolean results in the list.
