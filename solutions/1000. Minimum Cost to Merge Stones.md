title:  Minimum Cost to Merge Stones-out
permalink: /s1000
---

The problem asks us to find the minimum cost to merge stones. Given an integer array `stones` where `stones[i]` is the weight of the i-th stone, and an integer `K`. The rule for merging the stones is:
- We can merge exactly `K` stones into one with a cost equal to the sum of weights of these `K` stones.
- The problem is to find the minimum cost to merge all the stones into one stone. If it is not possible to merge the stones into one stone, return -1.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of the values of `stones` and `K`?
   - The length of `stones` is exactly 4.
   
2. What should be returned if it is not possible to merge all stones into one?
   - If it is not possible to merge all stones into one, return `-1`.

3. Could the stones array be empty?
   - The problem statement implies there would always be stones to merge, so no need to handle the empty case.

## Strategy

The main challenge here is to compute the process efficiently. To solve this, a dynamic programming approach seems appropriate based on subproblems.

1. **Basic Checks**:
    - If `(len(stones) - 1) % (K - 1) != 0`, then it's impossible to end up with exactly one pile.

2. **Dynamic Programming Definition**:
    - Let `dp[i][j]` be the minimum cost to merge stones from index `i` to index `j`.
    - Use a prefix sum array to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray.

3. **Recurrence Relation**:
    - To merge stones[i:j], divide it into parts that can be merged independently until we can merge the whole segment.
    - Use: `dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][m] + dp[m+1][j]) + total sum from i to j` if the length of `j-i` is `K`, otherwise just compute down to basic merges.

## Code

```python
def mergeStones(stones, K):
    n = len(stones)
    if (n - 1) % (K - 1) != 0:
        return -1
    
    # prefix sum array to calculate the sum of stones efficiently
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + stones[i]
    
    # dp table
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    # calculate minimum cost
    for m in range(K, n + 1):  # m is the length of the interval
        for i in range(n - m + 1):
            j = i + m - 1
            dp[i][j] = float('inf')
            for t in range(i, j, K - 1):
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][t] + dp[t + 1][j])
            if (j - i) % (K - 1) == 0:
                dp[i][j] += prefix_sum[j + 1] - prefix_sum[i]
    
    return dp[0][n - 1]

# Example usage:
stones = [3, 2, 4, 1]
K = 2
print(mergeStones(stones, K))  # Should output the total minimum cost.
```

## Time Complexity

- **Space Complexity**: `O(n^2)` because of the DP table.
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n^3 / K)` due to the triply nested loops for filling the DP table.
