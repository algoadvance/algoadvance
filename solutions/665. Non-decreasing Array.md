title:  Non-decreasing Array-out
permalink: /s665
---
Given an array `nums` with `n` integers, your task is to check if it could become non-decreasing by modifying at most one element.

We define an array as non-decreasing if `nums[i] <= nums[i + 1]` holds for every `i` (0-based) such that `0 <= i <= n - 2`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [4,2,3]
Output: true
Explanation: You could modify the first 4 to 1 to get a non-decreasing array.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [4,2,1]
Output: false
Explanation: You can't get a non-decreasing array by modifying at most one element.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [3,4,2,3]
Output: false
Explanation: You can't get a non-decreasing array by modifying at most one element.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the array be empty?**
   - Generally, the array has at least one element as per such problems.
2. **What should we return for an already non-decreasing array?**
   - We should return `true` since no modification is needed.
3. **Should the solution handle large input sizes effectively?**
   - Yes, the solution should be optimized for larger input sizes.

### Strategy
1. **Identify violations**: Traverse through the list and check for any positions where `nums[i] > nums[i + 1]`.
2. **Modification analysis**: If more than one violation is found, return `false`. If exactly one violation is found:
    - Check if modifying `nums[i]` to `nums[i + 1]` or modifying `nums[i + 1]` to `nums[i]` results in a non-decreasing array.
3. **Boundary cases**: 
   - Ensure that we consider boundary indexes correctly to avoid out-of-bound errors.
   - Ensure that changing one element doesn't violate any non-decreasing subarray property.

### Code
```python
def checkPossibility(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    if n <= 1:
        return True
    
    count = 0  # Count of modifications needed
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if nums[i] > nums[i + 1]:
            if count == 1:
                return False
            count += 1
            # Deciding whether to change nums[i] or nums[i + 1]
            if i == 0 or nums[i - 1] <= nums[i + 1]:
                nums[i] = nums[i + 1]  # Modify nums[i]
            else:
                nums[i + 1] = nums[i]  # Modify nums[i + 1]
    
    return True

# Example usage:
nums = [4, 2, 3]
print(checkPossibility(nums))  # Output: True
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this approach is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array. This is because we only traverse the array once to check for violations and possible fixes.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is `O(1)` since we only use a few auxiliary variables (`count`) and modify the array in-place without requiring extra space.
