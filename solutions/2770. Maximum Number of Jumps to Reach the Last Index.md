title:  Maximum Number of Jumps to Reach the Last Index-out
permalink: /s2770
---

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, you are required to find the maximum number of jumps to reach the last index from the first index. A jump from index `i` to index `j` is considered valid if:

- `0 <= i < j < len(nums)`
- The absolute difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is less than or equal to `target`

Return the maximum number of such jumps needed to reach the last index. If it is impossible to reach the last index from the first, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the array can have negative, zero, and positive numbers.
  
2. **What should be returned if the array length is 1?**
   - Since we start at the first index which is also the last, we should return 0.

3. **Is there any upper limit on the array size or the integer values in the array?**
   - The problem doesnâ€™t specify, but typical LeetCode constraints apply.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, a dynamic programming (DP) approach can be effective:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of jumps needed to reach index `i`.

2. **State Transition:**
   - The state transition will be derived from the condition of valid jumps. Traverse the array, and for each `i`, update `dp[j]` for all subsequent indices `j` such that `abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= target`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the DP value of the last index is `float('-inf')`, it means the last index is not reachable, and we should return -1.

4. **Result:**
   - The result will be the value `dp[n-1]` if reachable, otherwise -1.

### Code

Here's the Python implementation of the aforementioned strategy:

```python
def maximumJumps(nums, target):
    n = len(nums)
    
    # Edge case for single element array
    if n == 1:
        return 0

    # Initialize dp array
    dp = [-1] * n
    dp[0] = 0  # Start point has 0 jumps

    # Iterate over the array
    for i in range(n):
        if dp[i] == -1:
            # If current index is not reachable, skip it
            continue
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= target:
                dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[i] + 1)
    
    return dp[n - 1] if dp[n - 1] != -1 else -1
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization:** `O(n)` for initializing the `dp` array.
- **DP Updates:** The nested loop results in `O(n^2)` operations in the worst case.
 
Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n^2)`.

This approach leverages dynamic programming for an efficient and easy-to-understand solution.
