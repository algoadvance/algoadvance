You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

You are initially standing at index `0` and you can jump to any index `i` in the range `[1, k]` (i.e., `1 <= i <= k`).

You want to reach the final index in the array (i.e., `nums.length - 1`) with the maximum score. The score at each index `i` is `nums[i]`, and you can add these scores cumulatively when you jump to that index.

Return the maximum score you can get.

#### Example:
- **Input:**
  ``` 
  nums = [1,-1,-2,4,-7,3], k = 2
  ```
- **Output:**
  ```
  7
  ```
  **Explanation:**
  You can start at index 0 and jump to index 3:
  - Index 0 -> `1`
  - Index 3 -> `4` (current score is `1 + 4` = `5`)
  Then jump to index 5:
  - Index 5 -> `3` (current score is `5 + 3` = `8`)

- **Note:**
  The final output value should be `8`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `k` be larger than the length of `nums`?**
   - No, by problem constraints, `k` is usually less than or equal to the length of `nums`.
2. **Are there any constraints on the values within `nums`?**
   - The elements in `nums` can be positive or negative, allowing for different strategies involving risk and reward.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming with Deque:**
   - To efficiently solve this problem, use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum score to reach index `i`.
   - A deque (double-ended queue) will be useful to maintain a window of indices for the maximum scores within the last `k` jumps.
   - Initialize the `dp` array with `dp[0] = nums[0]` since you start at index 0.
   - Iterate over each index from `1` to `n-1` and update the `dp` array based on the maximum value available in the deque (which falls within the range `[i-k, i-1]`).

2. **Deque Operations:**
   - Remove indices from the front of the deque if they are no longer within the range.
   - Maintain decreasing order of values in the deque; remove indices from the back if their corresponding `dp` values are lesser than the current `dp` value being considered for insertion.

3. **Final Result:**
   - The value at `dp[n-1]` will give the maximum score to reach the last index.

### Code

```python
from collections import deque

def maxResult(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    dp = [0] * n
    dp[0] = nums[0]
    
    dq = deque([0])  # Store indexes not values
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        # remove indexes from the front if they are out of bound k
        if dq[0] < i - k:
            dq.popleft()
        
        # the current dp[i] will be the value of dp[dq[0]] + nums[i]
        dp[i] = dp[dq[0]] + nums[i]
        
        # maintain deque: remove indices from the back if their dp values are less than or equal to dp[i]
        while dq and dp[dq[-1]] <= dp[i]:
            dq.pop()
        
        dq.append(i)
    
    # The result will be at the last index
    return dp[-1]

# Example usage
nums = [1, -1, -2, 4, -7, 3]
k = 2
print(maxResult(nums, k))  # Output: 7
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) – Each element is processed at most once, and each deque operation runs in constant time.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\) – Space needed for the `dp` array and the deque.

This approach ensures optimal jumps and calculates the maximum score efficiently using dynamic programming combined with a deque.
