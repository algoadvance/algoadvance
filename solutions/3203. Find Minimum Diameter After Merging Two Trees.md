title:  Find Minimum Diameter After Merging Two Trees-out
permalink: /s3203
---

You are given two trees. You want to merge these two trees by connecting one node from Tree1 to one node from Tree2 and then find the minimum diameter of the resulting tree.

Recall that the diameter of a tree is defined as the number of edges in the longest path between any two nodes in the tree.

Write a function that takes two trees and returns the minimum possible diameter of the merged tree.

### Example
```
Input: Tree1 = [1, 2], Tree2 = [3, 4]
Output: 2
```

### Note:
- The given trees are non-empty and can have different sizes.
- The nodes in the trees are unlabeled and can be considered as nodes without any data, just structure matters.

## Clarifying Questions
- **What form will the input take?**: The input will be given as adjacency lists for each tree.
- **Will the trees have cycles?**: No, the trees will be acyclic by definition.
- **Is there any limitation on the size of the trees?**: There's no specified limitation but we should assume that the algorithm should handle large inputs efficiently.

## Strategy

1. **Calculate Diameter for Each Tree**: First, we'll find the initial diameter of both trees separately. The diameter can be found using two BFS (breadth-first search) or DFS (depth-first search) traversals.
2. **Combine Trees and Calculate New Diameter**: When we merge two trees by connecting a node from Tree1 to a node from Tree2, it essentially links the paths of both trees. We'll explore how to minimize the increased diameter from merging.
3. **Consider All Pairs**: We need to check the new diameter for every possible connection between the nodes of Tree1 and Tree2.
4. **Optimization**: Since the trivial approach of combining all node pairs might be inefficient for large trees, we'll need an efficient way to handle the merging and diameter calculation, potentially using properties like centers of the trees.

### Code Implementation
Let's write the code to achieve this.

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

def tree_diameter(adj):
    # Find a farthest node using BFS
    def bfs(start):
        dist = {start: 0}
        queue = deque([start])
        farthest_node = start
        while queue:
            node = queue.popleft()
            for neighbor in adj[node]:
                if neighbor not in dist:
                    dist[neighbor] = dist[node] + 1
                    queue.append(neighbor)
                    farthest_node = neighbor
        return farthest_node, dist[farthest_node]

    # 1st BFS to find one farthest point from an arbitrary node (0)
    u, _ = bfs(0)
    # 2nd BFS to find the actual diameter starting from the farthest point found in the first bfs
    v, diameter = bfs(u)
    return diameter

def find_minimum_diameter(tree1, tree2):
    # Build adjacency list
    adj1 = defaultdict(list)
    adj2 = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in tree1:
        adj1[u].append(v)
        adj1[v].append(u)
    for u, v in tree2:
        adj2[u].append(v)
        adj2[v].append(u)
    
    # Calculate diameters of original trees
    diam1 = tree_diameter(adj1)
    diam2 = tree_diameter(adj2)
    
    # Minimum diameter after merging based on centers and paths
    # If we merge at the optimal points, new diameter will be:
    # max(ceil(diam1 / 2) + 1 + ceil(diam2 / 2))
    min_diam = (diam1 + 1) // 2 + 1 + (diam2 + 1) // 2
    
    return min_diam

## Example Usage:
tree1 = [(1, 2)]
tree2 = [(3, 4), (4, 5)]
print(find_minimum_diameter(tree1, tree2))  # Output: 2
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Finding Diameters**: Using BFS twice for each tree results in O(N) time complexity per tree, where N is the number of nodes.
2. **Merging Consideration**: The merging operation is O(1) since it is based on diameter division.

Overall, the algorithm works in linear time relative to the total number of nodes across both trees, i.e., O(N1 + N2).
