1695. Maximum Erasure Value

You are given an array of positive integers `nums` and you want to erase a subarray containing unique elements. The score you get by erasing the subarray is equal to the sum of its elements.

Return the maximum score you can get by erasing exactly one subarray.

A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.

Example:

```
Input: nums = [4,2,4,5,6]
Output: 17
Explanation: The optimal subarray here is [2,4,5,6].
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input array `nums` be empty?**
   - No. Based on the problem statement, we can assume the array has at least one element.

2. **Are all elements of `nums` positive?**
   - Yes, the problem specifies that all elements are positive integers.

3. **Can we use additional data structures to help maintain the unique elements within the subarray?**
   - Yes, we can use data structures like sets or dictionaries to keep track of unique elements.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use the sliding window (or two-pointer) technique. The idea is to maintain a window that holds unique elements. We will expand the window by moving the right pointer and contract it by moving the left pointer whenever we encounter duplicate elements.

Steps:
1. Initialize two pointers `left` and `right` to the start of the array and a set `seen` to keep track of unique elements in the current window.
2. Initialize a variable `max_sum` to store the maximum sum of any subarray encountered.
3. Use a variable `current_sum` to maintain the sum of the current window.
4. Traverse the array with the right pointer. If the element at `right` is not in `seen`, add it to `seen` and update the `current_sum`. If it is in `seen`, shift the `left` pointer to the right until the window contains unique elements.
5. Update `max_sum` at each step.
6. Return `max_sum` as the result.

## Code

```python
def maximumUniqueSubarray(nums):
    seen = set()
    left = 0
    current_sum = 0
    max_sum = 0
    
    for right in range(len(nums)):
        while nums[right] in seen:
            seen.remove(nums[left])
            current_sum -= nums[left]
            left += 1
        seen.add(nums[right])
        current_sum += nums[right]
        max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    
    return max_sum

# Example Usage
nums = [4, 2, 4, 5, 6]
print(maximumUniqueSubarray(nums))  # Output: 17
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the array. Each element is processed at most twice (once by the right pointer and once by the left pointer).
- **Space Complexity:** O(min(n, m)), where n is the length of the array and m is the range of values in `nums`. In the worst case, the set `seen` might contain all unique elements of the array.
