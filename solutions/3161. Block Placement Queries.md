title:  Block Placement Queries-out

### Problem Statement

The problem provides you with a grid of size \( n \times n \) initially filled with zeros. You will receive a sequence of placement queries where each query consists of coordinates \((x, y)\) representing the top-left corner of an \( a \times b \) subgrid that should be filled with ones. After processing all the queries, you need to return the final grid.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum value of \( n \) (grid size)?
   - What is the maximum number of queries?
   - What are the ranges for \( a \) and \( b \) (subgrid dimensions)?

2. **Query Operations:**
   - Should invalid queries (i.e., where the subgrid extends outside the bounds of the main grid) be ignored or handled in a specific manner?

3. **Output Format:**
   - Should the final grid be printed or returned as a list of lists?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:

1. **Initialize the Grid:** Create an \( n \times n \) grid filled with zeros.
2. **Process Each Query:** Iterate through each query and update the subgrid area to 1. Make sure we handle bounds properly.
3. **Return the Updated Grid:** After processing all the queries, return the final grid.

### Code

Here is the Python code to implement the solution:

```python
def block_placement_queries(n, queries):
    # Initialize the grid with zeros
    grid = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]

    for x, y, a, b in queries:
        # Make sure we do not go out of bounds
        for i in range(a):
            for j in range(b):
                if x + i < n and y + j < n:
                    grid[x + i][y + j] = 1

    return grid

# Example usage
n = 5
queries = [
    (1, 1, 2, 2),
    (0, 0, 3, 3),
    (4, 4, 1, 1)
]

result = block_placement_queries(n, queries)
for row in result:
    print(row)
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity can be derived as follows:
- **Initializing the Grid:** \( O(n^2) \)
- **Processing Each Query:**
  - Let \( q \) be the number of queries.
  - For each query, we might need to update up to \( a \times b \) elements. In the worst case, updating an \( n \times n \) subgrid means \( O(n^2) \) operations per query.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity for processing all the queries would be \( O(q \times n^2) \) in the worst-case scenario.

### Conclusion

This solution initializes a grid and processes each block placement query by updating the relevant subgrid area while ensuring bounds are not violated. The time complexity should be reasonable for typical input sizes expected in interview scenarios.
