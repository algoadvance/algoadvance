title:  Binary Tree Cameras-out
permalink: /s968
---

You are given the `root` of a binary tree. We install cameras on the nodes of the tree. 

Each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.

Return the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range for the number of nodes in the tree?**
   - The number of nodes ranges from `1` to `1000`.

2. **What is the range for the value of the nodes?**
   - The value of the nodes is not specified as part of the problem; they are typically integers.

3. **What should be returned if the tree is empty?**
   - If the tree is empty (i.e., `root` is `None`), then the number of cameras needed is 0.

4. **What if there are no children in the tree, just the root?**
   - If there is only one node, then one camera is needed.

### Strategy

We can solve this problem using a Depth-First Search (DFS) strategy where we attempt to place cameras in such a way that every node is covered with the minimum number of cameras. We'll use a postorder DFS traversal (left-right-root) to decide the camera placement.

Each node in the tree can be in one of three states:

1. **Covered by a camera (`1`)**: This node is monitored by a camera from its child.
2. **Has a camera (`2`)**: A camera is placed at this node.
3. **No camera and not covered (`0`)**: This node is not covered by any camera.

The key intuition is:
- A leaf nodeâ€™s parent needs to have a camera if its child is not covered.
- A node places a camera if it observes that any of its children are not covered.

We'll define a function that returns the state of each node, and at each node, make a decision about the placement of cameras based on the states of its children.

### Code

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def minCameraCover(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        self.cameras = 0

        def dfs(node: TreeNode) -> int:
            if not node: 
                return 1

            left = dfs(node.left)
            right = dfs(node.right)

            if left == 0 or right == 0:
                self.cameras += 1
                return 2

            if left == 2 or right == 2:
                return 1

            return 0

        if dfs(root) == 0:
            self.cameras += 1

        return self.cameras
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N)
  - Each node is visited once during the DFS, so the total time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(H)
  - The space complexity due to the recursive stack is O(H), where H is the height of the tree. In the worst case (unbalanced tree), it can go up to O(N).

This approach ensures that we cover all nodes with the minimum number of cameras effectively using a bottom-up strategy in the DFS traversal.
