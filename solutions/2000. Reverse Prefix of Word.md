title:  Reverse Prefix of Word-out
permalink: /s2000
---

Given a 0-indexed string `word` and a character `ch`, reverse the segment of `word` that starts at the 0 index and ends at the index of the **first occurrence** of `ch` (inclusive). If the character `ch` does not exist in `word`, do nothing to the string.

- Return the resulting string after reversing the prefix.

Example 1:
```
Input: word = "abcdefd", ch = "d"
Output: "dcbaefd"
Explanation: The first occurrence of "d" is at index 3. 
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "dcbaefd".
```

Example 2:
```
Input: word = "xyxzxe", ch = "z"
Output: "zxyxxe"
Explanation: The first occurrence of "z" is at index 3.
Reverse the part of word from 0 to 3 (inclusive), the resulting string is "zxyxxe".
```

Example 3:
```
Input: word = "abcd", ch = "z"
Output: "abcd"
Explanation: "z" does not exist in word.
You should do nothing to the string.
```

Constraints:
- `1 <= word.length <= 250`
- `word` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `ch` is a lowercase English letter.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `word` contain duplicate characters?**
   - Yes, the string can contain duplicate characters.

2. **If the `ch` character is not in `word`, should we simply return the original `word`?**
   - Yes, if `ch` is not found in the string, return the string as is.

3. **Are all characters guaranteed to be lowercase English letters?**
   - Yes, `word` consists of lowercase English letters, and `ch` is a lowercase English letter.

## Strategy

1. **Find the first occurrence of `ch` in `word`**:
   - Use the string method `index` to find the position of `ch`. If `ch` is not found, handle the `ValueError` and return the original `word`.

2. **Reverse the substring from the start to the found index**:
   - Use slicing to segment the string into three parts: the part to reverse, the part after the reversed segment, and the segment to reverse itself. Concatenate these parts accordingly.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `ch` is not present in `word`.
   - If `word` only contains one character.
   - If `ch` is at the very start of `word`.

## Code

```python
def reversePrefix(word: str, ch: str) -> str:
    try:
        # Find index of first occurrence of ch
        idx = word.index(ch)
        # Slice the word into two parts and reverse the first part
        return word[:idx + 1][::-1] + word[idx + 1:]
    except ValueError:
        # If ch is not found, return word as is
        return word

# Test cases
print(reversePrefix("abcdefd", "d"))    # Output: "dcbaefd"
print(reversePrefix("xyxzxe", "z"))     # Output: "zxyxxe"
print(reversePrefix("abcd", "z"))       # Output: "abcd"
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `word`. This is primarily due to the slicing and reversing operations which each take O(k) time for the prefix of length `k`.
- The slicing and concatenation operations are efficient and run linearly with respect to the substring lengths.
