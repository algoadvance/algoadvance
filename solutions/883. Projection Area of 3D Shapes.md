title:  Projection Area of 3D Shapes-out
permalink: /s883
---
You are given an `n x n` grid represented by a 2D array `grid`. Each value `grid[i][j]` represents the height of a 3D shape placed on that `i-th` row and `j-th` column. We need to return the projection area of these 3D shapes. 

The projection area of a 3D shape on the xy-plane, yz-plane, and zx-plane is described as follows:

1. `xy-plane`: The number of cells in the grid that contain a positive integer.
2. `yz-plane`: The maximum value in each row.
3. `zx-plane`: The maximum value in each column.

The total projection area is the sum of the areas on the xy-plane, yz-plane, and zx-plane.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the input always a valid n x n grid?**
   - Yes, you can assume the input is always a valid n x n grid.
   
2. **What range of values can `grid[i][j]` take?**
   - Each value in the grid is a non-negative integer.

3. **How large can `n` be?**
   - Typically, `n` can be up to 50 in competitive programming scenarios on LeetCode.

## Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we will iterate through the grid once to compute the areas for the xy-plane, yz-plane, and zx-plane:
1. **xy-plane**: Count the number of positive integers in the grid.
2. **yz-plane**: For each row, find the maximum value.
3. **zx-plane**: For each column, find the maximum value.

## Code
```python
def projectionArea(grid):
    n = len(grid)
    xy_area = 0  # Projection on xy-plane
    yz_area = 0  # Projection on yz-plane (rows)
    zx_area = 0  # Projection on zx-plane (columns)
    
    # To compute zx_area, we need to store the max values for each column
    max_in_columns = [0] * n
    
    for i in range(n):
        max_in_row = 0
        for j in range(n):
            height = grid[i][j]
            
            if height > 0:
                xy_area += 1
            
            max_in_row = max(max_in_row, height)
            max_in_columns[j] = max(max_in_columns[j], height)
        
        yz_area += max_in_row
    
    zx_area = sum(max_in_columns)
    
    return xy_area + yz_area + zx_area
```

## Time Complexity
The overall time complexity of this solution is O(n^2) because we are iterating through each cell of the grid once (a total of n^2 cells).

## Explanation
1. **xy-plane area**: We count each grid cell with a positive integer.
2. **yz-plane area**: We find the maximum height in each row and accumulate these values.
3. **zx-plane area**: We find the maximum height in each column and sum them up.

By summing these three areas, we get the total projection area of the 3D shapes from all perspectives.
