title:  Insufficient Nodes in Root to Leaf Paths-out
permalink: /s1080
---
Given a binary tree root and an integer `limit`, delete all insufficient nodes in the tree. A node is insufficient if every root to leaf path intersecting this node has a sum strictly less than `limit`.

A node is defined as insufficient if all root to leaf paths going through this node have a sum less than `limit`. Any leaf node that is insufficient should also be removed along with any node that becomes a leaf node due to the removal process and which is also insufficient.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the input tree be empty?**
   - Yes, and in that case, the output should also be an empty tree.
2. **Are there any constraints on the values of the nodes?**
   - Node values can be any integer (both positive and negative).
3. **What should be returned?**
   - The root of the pruned binary tree.

### Strategy
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Use DFS to traverse the tree.
   - Calculate the sum from the root to each node.
   - For each leaf node, check if the sum so far is less than the limit. If it is, mark the node for deletion.
    
2. **Recursive Approach**:
   - A post-order traversal will be effective for this problem as decisions for deleting a node are made based on its children.
   - Recursively determine whether to delete each subtree by checking if it can meet the limit criteria when considered as part of any root to leaf path.

3. **Pruning Logic**:
   - For each node, recursively calculate the maximum path sum of its left and right subtrees.
   - If both subtrees (or leaves) do not meet the limit, prune (delete) those nodes.
   - Return the pruned node if it or its subtrees can meet the limit; otherwise, return `None`.

### Code
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def sufficientSubset(root, limit):
    def dfs(node, current_sum):
        if not node:
            return None
        
        # Update the current sum with the value of the current node
        current_sum += node.val
        
        # If it's a leaf node, return the node if its sum is >= limit
        if not node.left and not node.right:
            return node if current_sum >= limit else None
        
        # Recur for left and right subtrees
        node.left = dfs(node.left, current_sum)
        node.right = dfs(node.right, current_sum)
        
        # If both left and right are pruned away (None), prune this node as well
        if not node.left and not node.right:
            return None
        
        return node
    
    return dfs(root, 0)

# Helper function to print the tree for testing (Optional, not part of solution)
def print_tree(node, level=0, label='.'):
    if node is not None:
        print(' ' * (level*2) + label + ':', node.val)
        print_tree(node.left, level+1, 'L')
        print_tree(node.right, level+1, 'R')

# Example usage:
# Construct the tree
root = TreeNode(1)
root.left = TreeNode(2)
root.right = TreeNode(-3)
root.left.left = TreeNode(-5)
root.left.right = TreeNode(4)
root.right.left = TreeNode(-2)
root.right.right = TreeNode(-1)

# Given limit
limit = 2

# Sufficient subset
new_root = sufficientSubset(root, limit)
print_tree(new_root)

```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree, corresponding to the depth of the recursion stack in DFS. In the worst case, this could be O(n) for a skewed tree. For a balanced tree, it would be O(log n).
