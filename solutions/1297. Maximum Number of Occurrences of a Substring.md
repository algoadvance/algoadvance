title:  Maximum Number of Occurrences of a Substring-out
permalink: /s1297
---

### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return the maximum number of occurrences of any substring under the following constraints:

- The length of the substring must be between `minLength` and `maxLength` inclusive.
- The number of distinct characters in the substring must be less than or equal to `maxLetters`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints on input sizes?**
   - What is the maximum length of `s`?
   - Typical question to better understand the expected inputs.

2. **Examples and edge cases?**
   - What if `minLength` is greater than the length of `s`?
   - What if `maxLetters` is larger than the total possible distinct characters?

### Code

Now, let's move on to the strategy and code implementation.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, follow these steps:
1. **Generate All Valid Substrings:** Iterate through the string to extract all substrings of lengths between `minLength` to `maxLength`.
2. **Count Valid Substrings:** For each substring, check if it meets the `maxLetters` constraint (i.e., it has less than or equal to `maxLetters` distinct characters).
3. **Track Substring Frequencies:** Use a dictionary to count the frequency of valid substrings.
4. **Determine Maximum Frequency:** Return the maximum count from the frequency dictionary.

### Implementation

```python
def maxFreq(s: str, maxLetters: int, minLength: int, maxLength: int) -> int:
    from collections import defaultdict
    from collections import Counter
    
    def valid_substring(sub):
        return len(set(sub)) <= maxLetters

    n = len(s)
    substring_count = defaultdict(int)
    
    for length in range(minLength, maxLength + 1):
        for i in range(n - length + 1):
            substring = s[i:i + length]
            if valid_substring(substring):
                substring_count[substring] += 1
    
    return max(substring_count.values(), default=0)

# Example usage
s = "aababcaab"
maxLetters = 2
minLength = 2
maxLength = 3
print(maxFreq(s, maxLetters, minLength, maxLength))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity
Evaluating the time complexity can help us understand the performance:

- **Outer Loop:** Iterates from `minLength` to `maxLength` (let's denote this by `L`), thus running `O(L)` times.
- **Inner Loop:** For each length, iterate through all starting positions of substrings, which is approximately `O(n)` for each valid length.

Thus, the overall complexity is approximately `O(n * L)`, where `n` is the length of the string and `L` is the range from `minLength` to `maxLength`.

### Space Complexity

- The space needed for the `substring_count` dictionary can be as much as the number of unique substrings that meet the criteria, thus in the worst case, space could be `O(n * L)` if each substring is unique.
