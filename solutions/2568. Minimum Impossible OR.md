title:  Minimum Impossible OR-out
permalink: /s2568
---
You are given an integer array `nums`. You want to find the minimum non-negative integer that cannot be represented as the OR (bitwise OR) of any subset of `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions
- **Q:** What is the maximum length of the `nums` array?
  - **A:** According to the problem constraints, the length `n` of the array is bounded by the range `[1, 1000]`.
- **Q:** What is the range of the integers in `nums`?
  - **A:** Each integer in `nums` is within the range `[0, 10^9]`.
- **Q:** Can `nums` contain duplicate elements?
  - **A:** Yes, `nums` can have duplicates.

### Strategy
1. **Understanding the OR Operation:**
   - The OR operation between two bits results in a bit that is `1` if at least one of the corresponding bits of the operands is `1`. 
   - For example, `3 | 5` (in binary: `011 | 101 = 111`, which is `7` in decimal).

2. **Subsets and ORs:**
   - We need to evaluate all possible subset OR combinations. Directly evaluating OR combinations of all subsets would be computationally expensive given the constraints.
   - Instead, a more insightful approach is to recognize that we can simulate possible OR outcomes incrementally starting from `0`.

3. **Simulate Smallest Missing OR Outcome:**
   - If we track boolean reachable values using OR operations starting from `0`, the minimum OR result that we cannot construct with the given set is our answer.
   - Use a set to track all possible OR result values.

### Code
Let's implement this using a set to keep track of seen OR results.

```python
def minImpossibleOR(nums):
    # Initialize a set to keep track of reachable results
    seen = set()
    seen.add(0)
    
    # Iterate over each number in the input list
    for num in nums:
        # Create a list to capture new values to add to the set
        new_results = set()
        
        # Compute the OR with already seen values and add those results
        for existing in seen:
            new_results.add(existing | num)
        
        # Merge new_results into seen set
        seen.update(new_results)
    
    # Start checking from the smallest non-negative integer
    minimum_or = 0
    while minimum_or in seen:
        minimum_or += 1

    return minimum_or

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 2, 4]
print(minImpossibleOR(nums))  # Output will be 8
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:**
  - Worst-case scenario, we may iterate over all `nums` and consider their OR combinations. This leads to:
  - Initial while loop to check from 0 upwards is O(n), given the constraints.
  - The main loop's time complexity is effectively `O(n^2)` in the worst case due to updating the set `seen`. But given the constraints (n <= 1000), this is manageable.
- **Space Complexity:**
  - We are using a set to track intermediate results, which in the worst case can grow significantly based on varying OR combinations. However, it is still within acceptable limits (O(k) where k depends on the unique OR results formed).

This solution strikes a balance between optimal performance and maintaining readability and correctness.
