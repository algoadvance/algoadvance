title:  Minimum Processing Time-out
permalink: /s2895
---
Given `num_crates`, an integer representing the number of crates in a warehouse, and `k`, an integer representing the number of workers, determine the minimum processing time required to process all the crates if each worker can process at most one crate in a given minute. A worker can be assigned to another crate only after finishing their current crate.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the value range for `num_crates` and `k`?**  
   Typically, values for typical warehouse scenarios range from small numbers to potentially very large numbers.

2. **Can `num_crates` be less than `k`, and if so, should we assume that some workers will be idle?**  
   Yes, if `num_crates` is less than `k`, some workers will indeed be idle.

3. **Are there any constraints or specific considerations regarding the order in which crates are processed or priorities among workers?**  
   No, workers just take crates as they become available without any specific order or priority.

### Strategy
1. **Equal Distribution of Crates:**
   - If `num_crates` is less than or equal to `k`, then the minimum processing time will be 1 minute since each worker can process one crate simultaneously, and all crates can be processed immediately.
   - If `num_crates` is greater than `k`, the problem becomes one of distributing the crates among the workers as evenly as possible to minimize the maximum time any worker spends processing.

2. **Mathematical Approach:**
   - Use integer division and modulus operations:
     - Compute the `full_load` as `num_crates // k`, which represents the number of full workloads each worker would handle.
     - Compute the `remainder` as `num_crates % k`, which represents the extra crates that need to be distributed.
   
3. **Calculate the Minimum Time:**
   - Each worker will handle `full_load` crates.
   - Additionally, `remainder` workers will handle one extra crate.
   - Therefore, the minimum processing time will be `full_load + (1 if remainder > 0 else 0)`.

### Time Complexity
- The solution involves a few arithmetic operations, each of which uses constant time complexity \(O(1)\).

### Code
```python
def minimum_processing_time(num_crates: int, k: int) -> int:
    if num_crates <= k:
        return 1
    
    full_load = num_crates // k
    remainder = num_crates % k
    
    return full_load + (1 if remainder > 0 else 0)

# Example Usages
print(minimum_processing_time(10, 3))  # Output: 4
print(minimum_processing_time(5, 5))   # Output: 1
print(minimum_processing_time(7, 2))   # Output: 4
print(minimum_processing_time(1, 5))   # Output: 1
```

- **Explanation:**
  - In the first example, `10` crates and `3` workers distribute as `3 crates each + 1 extra`, leading to 4 minutes.
  - In the second example, `5` crates and `5` workers allow each worker to have 1 crate, meaning 1 minute is enough.
  - In the third example, `7` crates and `2` workers distribute as `3 crates each + 1 extra`, leading to 4 minutes.
  - In the last example, `1` crate and `5` workers mean processing takes only 1 minute since only one worker is utilized.

This approach ensures that we determine the minimum processing time required based on the given constraints and distribution logic.
