### Problem Statement

Given a positive integer `n`, return the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both `n` and 2.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints and Edge Cases**: 
   - What are the minimum and maximum values for `n`? 
   - Should we consider the performance for very large values of `n`?
2. **Inputs and Outputs**:
   - Input is a single integer `n`.
   - Output is a single integer which is the smallest multiple of both `n` and 2.

### Strategy

To find the smallest multiple of both `n` and 2:
1. We need to consider the properties of even and odd numbers:
   - If `n` is already even, then `n` itself is already a multiple of both `n` and 2.
   - If `n` is odd, then multiplying `n` by 2 will make it even.
   
Thus, the strategy is simple:
1. Check if `n` is even. If so, return `n`.
2. If `n` is odd, return `2 * n`.

### Code

```python
def smallest_even_multiple(n: int) -> int:
    if n % 2 == 0:
        return n
    else:
        return 2 * n
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(1)\) because it requires only a constant number of operations (a modulus operation and a conditional check).
- The space complexity is also \(O(1)\) since we are not using any additional data structures.

This solution should be efficient even for very large values of `n`.

Let's test the function with a few examples:

```python
# Test cases
print(smallest_even_multiple(5))  # Expected output: 10 (since 5 is odd, 5 * 2 = 10)
print(smallest_even_multiple(6))  # Expected output: 6 (since 6 is even)
print(smallest_even_multiple(1))  # Expected output: 2 (since 1 is odd, 1 * 2 = 2)
print(smallest_even_multiple(8))  # Expected output: 8 (since 8 is even)
```

This should cover the basic functionality of the solution. Feel free to provide additional test cases or any other specific requirements!
