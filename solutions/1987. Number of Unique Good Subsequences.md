title:  Number of Unique Good Subsequences-out
permalink: /s1987
---
You are given a binary string `binary` which consists only of '0's and '1's. A subsequence of this string is called **good** if it is **non-empty** and does not have any leading zeros (except for the string "0" itself). Return the number of **unique good subsequences** in the `binary` string.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Clarifying Questions
Before proceeding, it is helpful to clarify certain aspects of the problem:
1. **Q:** Can the string `binary` contain any other characters apart from '0' and '1'?
   **A:** No, the string `binary` consists only of '0's and '1's.
2. **Q:** Are we considering subsequences or substrings?
   **A:** We are considering subsequences, which means the characters are not required to be contiguous.
3. **Q:** Should the subsequences include the empty subsequence?
   **A:** No, the subsequence must be non-empty.
4. **Q:** Do we need to consider sequences like "000" or sequences starting with '0' to be good?
   **A:** Only the string "0" itself is considered good if it appears in the binary string, subsequences starting with '0' having more than one character such as "0001" or "001" are not good.

### Strategy
To solve the problem, we need to count all unique subsequences that satisfy the given conditions. The plan is as follows:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Use a set to track all unique good subsequences encountered so far.
   - Traverse the binary string and for each character, generate new subsequences by appending it to the subsequences found so far.
   - Avoid duplicates by using a set.
   - If '0' is present in the string, consider the single character '0' as a unique good subsequence.

2. **Tracking leading zeros**:
   - Special handling is needed for the string "0", which is considered a valid subsequence if it appears.

### Code
Hereâ€™s the Python code to solve this problem using the described approach:

```python
def number_of_unique_good_subsequences(binary: str) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    # Two sets to track subsequences - those starting with 1 and in general
    subsequences = set()
    has_zero = False
    
    for char in binary:
        new_subsequences = set()
        # Generate new subsequences by appending current character
        for seq in subsequences:
            new_subsequences.add(seq + char)
        # Add current character as a potential starting point
        new_subsequences.add(char)
        
        # Update the set of subsequences
        subsequences.update(new_subsequences)
        
        if char == '0':
            has_zero = True

    # Special case handling for the subsequence "0"
    if has_zero:
        result = (len(subsequences) % MOD) + 1  # Adding the "0" subsequence
    else:
        result = len(subsequences) % MOD
    
    return result

# Example usage
binary = "001"
print(number_of_unique_good_subsequences(binary))  # Expected output is 2 (since "0" and "1")
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this approach can be described roughly as:
- **O(n * 2^n)**: In the worst case, where every new character can form a new combination with existing subsequences (though practical constraints keep it in check).
However, since the space is managed with a set, it avoids exact duplicates and is efficient concerning forming unique entries.
  
For real use cases in constraint coding scenarios, practical implementation would be tested for smaller values or optimizations could be introduced.
