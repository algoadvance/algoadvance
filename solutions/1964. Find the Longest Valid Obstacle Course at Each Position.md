title:  Find the Longest Valid Obstacle Course at Each Position-out
permalink: /s1964
---

You are given an array `obstacles` where `obstacles[i]` is the height of the `i-th` obstacle.

For each position `i`, find the length of the longest obstacle course in obstacles such that:
- You choose any number of obstacles between `0` and `i` inclusive.
- You must include the `i-th` obstacle.
- You must put the obstacles in a sequence where the values of the obstacles are non-decreasing.

Return an array `ans` of the same length as `obstacles`, where `ans[i]` is the length of the longest obstacle course ending at `i`.

### Example
```python
Input: obstacles = [1,2,3,2,1,5,1]
Output: [1,2,3,3,2,4,3]
```

## Clarifying questions
1. Can the array `obstacles` be empty? (No, it will always contain at least one element.)
2. What are the limits on the values in the `obstacles` array? (The height of the obstacles will be positive integers.)
3. What is the maximum length of the `obstacles` array? (The length could be up to `10^5`. Hence, the solution should be efficient.)

## Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach with Binary Search**: We'll use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest valid obstacle course ending at position `i`.
2. **Binary Search for Efficiency**: To optimize the search for the longest non-decreasing subsequence, weâ€™ll use a binary search with a list `lis_lengths` which will store the lowest possible tail value of all increasing subsequences of all lengths.
3. **Implementation Details**:
   - Iterate through each obstacle.
   - For each obstacle, use binary search on `lis_lengths` to find its position in the sorted list.
   - Update the `lis_lengths` list with the current obstacle at the found position if needed.
   - The length of the longest obstacle course ending at the current index is the length of the `lis_lengths` list up to that point.

## Code

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
from bisect import bisect_right

def longestObstacleCourseAtEachPosition(obstacles):
    lis_lengths = []
    result = []
    
    for height in obstacles:
        insert_pos = bisect_right(lis_lengths, height)
        
        if insert_pos == len(lis_lengths):
            lis_lengths.append(height)
        else:
            lis_lengths[insert_pos] = height
        
        result.append(insert_pos + 1)
    
    return result

# Example usage:
obstacles = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 5, 1]
print(longestObstacleCourseAtEachPosition(obstacles))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 3, 2, 4, 3]
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The overall time complexity of this solution is `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the length of the `obstacles` array. This is because each insertion operation into `lis_lengths` takes `O(log n)` due to the binary search, and we do this for each of the `n` elements.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(n)`, considering the storage for `lis_lengths` and the result array.
