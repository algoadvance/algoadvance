title:  Decode XORed Permutation-out
permalink: /s1734
---
You are given an integer array `encoded` of length `n-1` where `n` is an odd integer. The array `encoded` is derived from an array `perm` of length `n` of permutations of the first `n` positive integers.

Specifically, for all `i` from `0` to `n-2`:
```
encoded[i] = perm[i] XOR perm[i + 1]
```
Your goal is to decode the array `perm` and return it. 

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the integers in the array `encoded`?**
    - They will be between 1 and n, where n is an odd integer.
2. **Can we assume that the `encoded` array is always valid and derived from a valid permutation?**
    - Yes, you can assume that.
3. **Are there any memory constraints?**
    - No specific constraints were mentioned, so you can use additional memory if needed.

## Strategy
To decode the permutation, let's break down the problem:
1. The `encoded` array is formed by `perm[i] XOR perm[i + 1]`.
2. The permutation array `perm` contains all integers from 1 to `n`.
3. We need to derive `perm[0]` first because knowing `perm[0]` would allow us to decode the rest of `perm` with the help of `encoded`.

### Finding `perm[0]`:
1. Compute the XOR of all numbers from 1 to `n`, let’s call it `total_xor`.
   ```python
   total_xor = 1 ^ 2 ^ ... ^ n
   ```
2. Compute the XOR of all elements at even indices in `encoded` (1-based index), let’s call it `even_xor`.
   ```python
   even_xor = encoded[1] ^ encoded[3] ^ ... ^ encoded[n - 2]
   ```
3. Note that `even_xor` equates to `perm[1] XOR perm[3] XOR ... XOR perm[n-2]`.
4. `perm[0]` can then be derived by `total_xor XOR even_xor`.

### Constructing `perm`:
After determining `perm[0]`:
1. Use the `encoded` array to decode each subsequent element:
   ```python
   perm[i + 1] = perm[i] XOR encoded[i]
   ```

## Code
Here's the implementation:

```python
def decode(encoded):
    n = len(encoded) + 1
    
    # Step 1: Calculate total XOR for numbers 1 to n
    total_xor = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total_xor ^= i
    
    # Step 2: Calculate XOR for even indices in encoded (1-based index)
    even_xor = 0
    for i in range(1, len(encoded), 2):
        even_xor ^= encoded[i]
    
    # Step 3: Calculate perm[0]
    perm_0 = total_xor ^ even_xor
    
    # Step 4: Construct the perm list using perm_0 and encoded
    perm = [perm_0]
    for i in range(len(encoded)):
        perm.append(perm[-1] ^ encoded[i])
    
    return perm

# Example usage
encoded = [6,5,4,6]
print(decode(encoded))  # Output: [2, 4, 1, 5, 3]
```

## Time Complexity
The above implementation has a time complexity of \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `perm` array. This is because:
1. Calculating `total_xor` takes \(O(n)\).
2. Calculating `even_xor` takes \(O(n)\).
3. Constructing the `perm` array takes \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is linear with respect to the length of the `perm` array.
