title:  Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree-out
permalink: /s1448
---

You are given a binary tree where each node has an integer value. A node X in the tree is named **good** if in the path from root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.

Return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Nodes in blue are ‘good’.
    3
   / \
  1   4
 /   / \
3   1   5
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Nodes in blue are ‘good’.
 Root 3 is always a good node.
 3 -> 3 -> 4 is the only qualifying path.
 3 -> 3 -> 2 does not qualify as 2 is not >= 3.
    3
   / 
  3   
 / \
4   2
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: Root is considered as good.
    1
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the binary tree is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
- Each node's value is between `[-10^4, 10^4]`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Tree structure and interpretation**: We are interpreting the input as levels in the binary tree with null values for absent nodes.
2. **Edge cases**: Consider edge cases like all nodes having the same value, only one node, all values in descending order, etc.

## Strategy

The problem can be solved using Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal of the binary tree. During the traversal, we keep track of the highest value encountered in the path from the root to the current node. If the current node's value is greater than or equal to this maximum value, the current node is deemed 'good.' We then update the maximum value and recursively visit child nodes.

## Code

Here is the implementation of the solution in Python:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def goodNodes(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        def dfs(node, max_val):
            if not node:
                return 0

            # Check if current node is a good node
            good = 1 if node.val >= max_val else 0

            # Update the max value seen so far in the path
            new_max = max(max_val, node.val)

            # Continue DFS traversal on left and right children
            good += dfs(node.left, new_max)
            good += dfs(node.right, new_max)

            return good

        # Start DFS with root and its value as the initial max value
        return dfs(root, root.val)

# Example Usage:
# root = TreeNode(3)
# root.left = TreeNode(1, TreeNode(3))
# root.right = TreeNode(4, TreeNode(1), TreeNode(5))
# solution = Solution()
# print(solution.goodNodes(root))  # Output: 4
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(N)**, where **N** is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once during the depth-first search.

The space complexity of the solution is **O(H)**, where **H** is the height of the tree. In the worst case, the height of the tree can be up to **N** (e.g., when the tree is a straight line), but on average (for a balanced tree), the height **H** would be around **log(N)**.
