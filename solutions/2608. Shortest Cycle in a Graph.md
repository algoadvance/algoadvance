title:  Shortest Cycle in a Graph-out
permalink: /s2608
---
You are given an undirected graph represented by `n` nodes indexed from `0` to `n - 1`, and edges where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there's an edge between node `ai` and node `bi`. Return the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. If no cycle exists, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Graph Connectivity**: Is the graph always connected, or can it be a set of disconnected components?
   - The graph may contain multiple disconnected components.
2. **Input Constraints**: What are the constraints on `n` and `edges`?
   - Typically for such problems, the constraints are \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\) and the size of edges array would generally be such that the graph can be sparse or dense.
3. **Edge Cases**: What should we return if the graph has no edges? 
   - Return `-1` for graphs without any edges or no cycle.

### Strategy
We need to find the shortest cycle in an undirected graph. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step breakdown of the strategy to solve this problem:

1. **Graph Representation**: Use an adjacency list to represent the graph.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: 
   - Use BFS to identify cycles in the graph and compute their lengths.
   - For each node, do a BFS to find the shortest cycle that includes this node. This is critical as each BFS can discover the shortest cycle involving the start node.
3. **Tracking State in BFS**: 
   - Track the parent of each node to ensure we don't consider the back edge to the parent as part of the cycle.
   - If a node is visited that is not the immediate parent of the current node, a cycle is found.
4. **Cycle Detection**: During the BFS, if a cycle is detected, calculate its length and compare it with the current shortest found cycle.

### Code Implementation

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

def shortestCycle(n, edges):
    # Create the graph representation
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for ai, bi in edges:
        graph[ai].append(bi)
        graph[bi].append(ai)

    shortest_cycle_length = float('inf')
    
    # Helper function to perform BFS and find the shortest cycle involving start node
    def bfs(start):
        nonlocal shortest_cycle_length
        distances = {start: 0}
        queue = deque([(start, -1)])  # (current_node, parent_node)
        
        while queue:
            current, parent = queue.popleft()
            
            for neighbor in graph[current]:
                if neighbor == parent:
                    continue
                if neighbor in distances:
                    # Cycle detected
                    cycle_length = distances[current] + distances[neighbor] + 1
                    shortest_cycle_length = min(shortest_cycle_length, cycle_length)
                else:
                    distances[neighbor] = distances[current] + 1
                    queue.append((neighbor, current))

    for node in range(n):
        bfs(node)
    
    return shortest_cycle_length if shortest_cycle_length != float('inf') else -1
```

### Time Complexity
- **Building the Graph**: \(O(V + E)\), where \(V\) is the number of vertices, and \(E\) is the number of edges.
- **BFS for Each Node**: Each BFS operation will explore the graph in \(O(V + E)\). Since we may perform BFS from each node:
  - Total Time Complexity: \(O(V \times (V + E))\)

This is relatively efficient given typical constraints in competitive programming context, and the BFS approach ensures accurate cycle detection and minimization of their lengths.
