title:  Maximum Score from Performing Multiplication Operations-out
permalink: /s1770
---

Given two integer arrays `nums` and `multipliers` of size `n` and `m` respectively, where `n >= m`, you have to perform exactly `m` operations. In the `i-th` (0-indexed) operation, you will:
- Choose exactly one integer `nums[left]` or `nums[right]` where `left + right = len(nums) - 1`, meaning you choose an element from either the start or the end of the `nums` array.
- Multiply the chosen element with `multipliers[i]`.
- Add the result to your score.
- Remove the element from the `nums` array.

Return the maximum score after performing `m` operations.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints on the values of the elements in `nums` and `multipliers`**: Can they contain negative numbers?
   - Yes, elements in `nums` and `multipliers` can be negative, adding complexity to the choice of maximizing the score.
2. **Size of `nums` and `multipliers`**: Do they affect the approach to choose (e.g., dynamic programming, greedy)?
   - Yes, but given constraints `n >= m`, dynamic programming can be an effective strategy since it can handle overlapping subproblems optimally.

## Strategy
To solve the problem optimally, we'll use dynamic programming (DP). The idea is to set up a `dp` table where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum score obtainable by taking `i` elements from the start (left) and `j` elements from the end (right) after considering the first `i + j` multipliers.

### Steps:
1. **Initialize a DP table**: A 2D list where `dp[i][j]` denotes the maximum score using `i` elements from the start and `j` elements from the end.
2. **Base Case**: `dp[0][0] = 0` because no elements have been taken yet.
3. **State Transition**:
   - If considering taking an element from the start: `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + nums[i-1] * multipliers[i+j-1]`
   - If considering taking an element from the end: `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + nums[n-j] * multipliers[i+j-1]`
4. Use the above transitions to fill up the DP table.
5. The result will be in `max(dp[i][m-i] for i in range(m+1))`.

### Code
```python
def maximumScore(nums, multipliers):
    m, n = len(multipliers), len(nums)
    # DP with dimensions (m+1) x (m+1), initialized to 0's
    dp = [[0] * (m + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    
    # Fill the dp table
    for total in range(1, m + 1):
        for left in range(total + 1):
            right = total - left
            if left > 0:
                dp[left][right] = max(dp[left][right], dp[left - 1][right] + nums[left - 1] * multipliers[total - 1])
            if right > 0:
                dp[left][right] = max(dp[left][right], dp[left][right - 1] + nums[n - right] * multipliers[total - 1])
    
    # The maximum score by considering m operations
    return max(dp[i][m - i] for i in range(m + 1))

# Example usage
nums = [1, 2, 3]
multipliers = [3, 2, 1]
print(maximumScore(nums, multipliers))  # Output: 14
```

### Time Complexity
- **Space Complexity**: `O(m^2)` due to the DP table of size `(m+1) x (m+1)`
- **Time Complexity**: `O(m^2)` due to filling every entry in the DP table.

This approach ensures that we consider all possible "left" and "right" element pickings efficiently using dynamic programming.
