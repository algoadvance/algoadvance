### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` representing coordinates with some format issues. The valid format for coordinates is `(x, y)`, where `x` and `y` are valid numbers. Your task is to return all possible valid coordinates obtained from the given string `s`.

The input string `s` will always be of the form `"(abc)"`, where `a`, `b`, and `c` are digits, and there are no commas, spaces, or additional parentheses.

### Example

```
Input: s = "(123)"
Output: ["(1, 23)", "(12, 3)", "(1.2, 3)", "(1, 2.3)"]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are the digits in the string always non-zero?
   **A:** No, the digits can include zero. The function needs to handle the correct placement of decimal points, especially considering leading zeros.

2. **Q:** How long can the input string be?
   **A:** The input string is always guaranteed to be enclosed within a single pair of parentheses and will contain at least two digits.

3. **Q:** Are floating point numbers allowed as coordinates, and how should they be formatted?
   **A:** Yes, floating point numbers are allowed. Decimal points should not appear at the start or end of the number and there shouldn't be any leading zeros unless the number is "0".

### Strategy

The strategy to solve this problem involves:

1. **Parsing the Input:** Remove the outer parentheses to extract the numeric string content.
2. **Generating Possible Coordinates:** For each possible split of the string into two parts, generate all valid representations for both the x and y parts.
3. **Validating Coordinates:**
   - For each part of the split, determine all valid ways to insert a decimal point (if applicable).
   - Ensure that numbers do not start or end with a decimal point and handle zeros correctly.
4. **Creating Pairs:** Combine valid representations of the x and y parts to generate the full coordinate pairs in the required format.

### Code

```python
def ambiguousCoordinates(s):
    def valid_with_decimal(s):
        res = []
        if s[0] != '0' or s == "0":  # can be "123" -> "123" or "0"
            res.append(s)
        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            left, right = s[:i], s[i:]
            if (left[0] != '0' or left == '0') and right[-1] != '0':
                res.append(left + '.' + right)
        return res

    s = s[1:-1]  # remove the parentheses
    result = []

    for i in range(1, len(s)):
        left, right = s[:i], s[i:]
        left_options = valid_with_decimal(left)
        right_options = valid_with_decimal(right)
        for l in left_options:
            for r in right_options:
                result.append(f"({l}, {r})")

    return result

# Example usage:
s = "(123)"
print(ambiguousCoordinates(s))  # ["(1, 23)", "(12, 3)", "(1.2, 3)", "(1, 2.3)"]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Parsing Input:** O(n) where n is the length of the string.
- **Generating Split and Decimal Validations:** For each of the n splits, validating each segment requires essentially linear scans for valid decimal placement.
  - Combined, this is O(n^2) considering all possible splits and valid placements.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n^2), which should be efficient for reasonable input sizes given coordinate problem constraints.

I hope this provides a clear and concise solution to the problem. Let me know if you have any further questions!
