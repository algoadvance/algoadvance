title:  Check if Bitwise OR Has Trailing Zeros-out
permalink: /s2980
---
You have been given an integer `x` and a non-negative integer `k`. Your task is to check if the bitwise OR of the integer `x` with `2^k - 1` has at least `k` trailing zeros in its binary representation. 

Write a function `hasTrailingZeros(x: int, k: int) -> bool` that returns `True` if the condition is met, otherwise `False`.

### Example:
- Input: `x = 8, k = 3`
- Output: `True`

The integer `8` in binary form is `1000`. The integer `2^3 - 1` is `7` which is `111` in binary. Bitwise OR of `1000` and `111` is `1111`, and it has `3` trailing zeros.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. What is the range of values for `x` and `k`?
   - Typically, these would be within the range of a typical 32-bit integer, but please confirm if there are specific constraints.
2. Should we handle any special input cases such as negative values for `x`?
   - Negative values should not be considered as per usual problem constraints unless specified otherwise.

## Strategy:
1. Calculate `2^k - 1`.
2. Perform a bitwise OR operation between `x` and `2^k - 1`.
3. Check if the resultant number has at least `k` trailing zeros.
4. Return `True` if it does, otherwise `False`.

To check for trailing zeros, the condition `res & (2^k - 1) == 0` can be used, where `res` is the result of the bitwise OR operation, as this will check if the last `k` bits are zero.

## Code:
```python
def hasTrailingZeros(x: int, k: int) -> bool:
    mask = (1 << k) - 1  # This creates a number with `k` trailing ones
    result = x | mask
    
    # Check if the result has at least `k` trailing zeros
    return (result & mask) == 0

# Example Usage
print(hasTrailingZeros(8, 3))  # Output: True, `1000 | 0111 = 1111`
```

## Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is O(1) because the operations involved (bitwise OR, AND, and shifts) are constant-time operations.

## Additional Test Cases:
```python
print(hasTrailingZeros(0, 2))  # Output: True
print(hasTrailingZeros(15, 4))  # Output: False
print(hasTrailingZeros(32, 5))  # Output: True
print(hasTrailingZeros(7, 3))  # Output: False
```

This function should now be efficient and handle the problem as described.
