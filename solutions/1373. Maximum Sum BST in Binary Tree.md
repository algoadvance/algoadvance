title:  Maximum Sum BST in Binary Tree-out
permalink: /s1373
---

Given a binary tree `root`, the task is to return the maximum sum of all keys of any sub-tree which is also a Binary Search Tree (BST). A Binary Search Tree is a tree where for every node, the left subtree contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key, and the right subtree contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints of the binary tree?**
   - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 4 * 10^4]`.
   - The value of each node is in the range `[-4 * 10^4, 4 * 10^4]`.

2. **Can the tree contain duplicate values?**
   - No, since it must adhere to the properties of a Binary Search Tree (BST).

3. **What is the expected output for an empty tree?**
   - The tree will always have at least one node, as per the constraints.

### Strategy

1. **Recursive Postorder Traversal:** 
   - We need to visit every node and consider whether the subtree rooted at that node forms a BST.
   - Traverse the tree using postorder traversal (left-right-root) to ensure that we process the children before the current node.

2. **Tracking Values:**
   - For each node, compute the following:
     - Whether the subtree rooted at this node is a BST.
     - The sum of values in this subtree if it is a BST.
     - The minimum and maximum values in this subtree to check the BST property with its parent node.
   
3. **Update Global Maximum Sum:**
   - Keep a global variable to store the maximum sum found for any BST subtree during the traversal.

4. **Combining Results:**
   - If both left and right subtrees are BSTs and the current node satisfies the BST properties concerning its left and right children, then the subtree rooted at the current node is a BST.
   - Update the global sum if the current subtree sum is greater than the existing maximum sum.

### Code

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def maxSumBST(self, root: TreeNode) -> int:
        def postorder(node):
            if not node:
                return True, 0, float('inf'), float('-inf')

            l_is_bst, l_sum, l_min, l_max = postorder(node.left)
            r_is_bst, r_sum, r_min, r_max = postorder(node.right)

            if l_is_bst and r_is_bst and l_max < node.val < r_min:
                subtree_sum = l_sum + r_sum + node.val
                self.max_sum = max(self.max_sum, subtree_sum)
                return True, subtree_sum, min(l_min, node.val), max(r_max, node.val)
            else:
                return False, 0, float('-inf'), float('inf')

        self.max_sum = 0
        postorder(root)
        return self.max_sum

# Usage example:
# root = TreeNode(1,
#                 left=TreeNode(4,
#                               left=TreeNode(2),
#                               right=TreeNode(4)),
#                 right=TreeNode(3,
#                                left=TreeNode(2),
#                                right=TreeNode(5,
#                                               right=TreeNode(6))))
# sol = Solution()
# print(sol.maxSumBST(root))  # output should be -> 20
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited exactly once during the post-order traversal.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(H)`, where `H` is the height of the binary tree. This is the space used by the call stack during recursion, which in the worst case (for an unbalanced tree) could be `O(N)` and in the best case (for a balanced tree) could be `O(log N)`.
