title:  Number of Dice Rolls With Target Sum-out
permalink: /s1155
---

You have `n` dice, and each die has `k` faces numbered from `1` to `k`.

Given three integers `n`, `k`, and `target`, return the number of possible ways (modulo 10^9 + 7) to roll the dice so the sum of the face-up numbers equals `target`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - `1 <= n <= 30`
   - `1 <= k <= 30`
   - `1 <= target <= 1000`
2. **Output Constraints:**
   - The solution should be returned modulo `10^9 + 7`.

3. **Examples:**
   - Example 1:
     ``` 
     Input: n = 1, k = 6, target = 3
     Output: 1 
     // Explanation: You can only get a sum of 3 with one die showing 3.
     ```
   - Example 2:
     ```
     Input: n = 2, k = 6, target = 7
     Output: 6
     // Explanation: There are six ways to get a sum of 7:
     // (1+6, 2+5, 3+4, 4+3, 5+2, 6+1)
     ```

### Strategy

We can solve this problem using Dynamic Programming (DP). Define `dp[i][j]` as the number of ways to roll `i` dice to get a sum of `j`. To form our DP transition:

1. **Base Case:**
   - `dp[0][0] = 1`: There is one way to get a sum of 0 with 0 dice.
   - `dp[0][j] = 0` for all `j > 0` because we cannot achieve a positive sum with 0 dice.

2. **Transition:**
   - For each dice `i`, we can sum the results of the previous dice's sums `j-x` where `1 <= x <= k` (i.e., any face value of the dice).
   - `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j-2] + ... + dp[i-1][j-k]`, ensuring we only consider valid sums `j-x >= 0`.

3. **Result:**
   - Our answer will be `dp[n][target]`.

### Code

```python
def numRollsToTarget(n, k, target):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    dp = [[0] * (target + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Base case
    dp[0][0] = 1
    
    # Fill the DP table
    for dice in range(1, n + 1):
        for t in range(1, target + 1):
            for face in range(1, k + 1):
                if t >= face:
                    dp[dice][t] = (dp[dice][t] + dp[dice - 1][t - face]) % MOD
    
    return dp[n][target]

# Example use cases
print(numRollsToTarget(1, 6, 3))       # Output: 1
print(numRollsToTarget(2, 6, 7))       # Output: 6
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n * target * k)`
  - The outer loops iterate over the number of dice `n` and the target sum range which is `target`.
  - The innermost loop iterates over each possible dice face value `k`.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(n * target)`
  - We use a 2D array `dp` to store results for subproblems.

This solution should efficiently handle the problem given constraints.
