title:  Distribute Elements Into Two Arrays II-out
permalink: /s3072
---
You are given a 2D integer array nums. You need to distribute the elements of nums into two 1D arrays arr1 and arr2 such that both arrays have the same number of elements. If one array has more elements than the other, you should return false.

The sum of the elements of arr1 should be equal to the sum of the elements of arr2. You may assume that it is always possible to form two such arrays if nums can be split into two equal-sized arrays.

The function to implement is:
```python
def canDistribute(nums: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
```

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Are the integers in `nums` always non-negative?**
   - Yes, for simplicity, assume all integers are non-negative.

2. **Is it guaranteed that `nums` will have an even number of elements?**
   - Yes, for the purpose of this problem, assume the 2D array `nums` contains an even number of integers.

3. **What are the constraints on the size of `nums`?**
   - The size of `nums` and the values of its elements should be reasonably small to facilitate computational feasibility.

## Strategy:
This is essentially a problem of dividing the elements of the 2D array `nums` into two subsets of equal size with equal sum. This can be approached via dynamic programming or backtracking:

1. **Flatten the 2D `nums` array into a 1D array.**
2. **Check the total sum of elements.** If it is odd, it's not possible to split into two equal-sum subsets; return False.
3. **Use dynamic programming to determine if there is a subset of half the elements that sums to half of the total sum.**

### Code:

```python
from typing import List

def canDistribute(nums: List[List[int]]) -> bool:
    # Flattening the 2D array to 1D array
    flat_nums = [num for sublist in nums for num in sublist]
    
    # Calculate total sum
    total_sum = sum(flat_nums)
    
    # If the sum is odd, return False
    if total_sum % 2 != 0:
        return False
    
    target = total_sum // 2
    n = len(flat_nums)
    
    # DP array where dp[i][j] represents whether we can achieve sum `j` with first `i` elements
    dp = [[False] * (target + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Initialize: ISum 0 can always be achieved with 0 elements
    for i in range(n + 1):
        dp[i][0] = True
    
    # Fill the DP table
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, target + 1):
            if j < flat_nums[i-1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]
            else:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] or dp[i-1][j - flat_nums[i-1]]
    
    return dp[n][target]

# Example usage
nums = [
    [1, 5, 11, 5],
    [1, 5, 11, 5]
]

print(canDistribute(nums))  # Output: True
```

## Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n * target), where `n` is the number of elements in the flattened array and `target` is half of the total sum.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n * target) due to the DP table used for computation.

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine if the array can be divided into two subsets with equal sum.
