title:  Recover Binary Search Tree-out
permalink: /s99
---

The problem "Recover Binary Search Tree" involves correcting a binary search tree (BST) in which two of the nodes had their values swapped by mistake. The goal is to identify the two nodes that were swapped and recover the BST by swapping their values back to their correct positions.

**Input:**
- The root of the BST where two nodes' values have been swapped.

**Output:**
- The BST after recovering it by swapping the two incorrect nodes.

For example:

    Input: [1,3,null,null,2]
    Tree structure: 
        1
       /
      3
       \
        2

    Output: [3,1,null,null,2]
    Tree structure corrected to:
        3
       /
      1
       \
        2

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can I assume that the given tree is always a valid BST except for the two swapped nodes?
2. Is it guaranteed that there are exactly two nodes that were swapped?
3. Can the tree contain duplicate values, or are all values unique?

### Strategy

1. **In-order Traversal**: Perform an in-order traversal of the tree. Since in-order traversal of a BST should produce a sorted sequence, any deviation from the sorted order indicates the swapped nodes.
2. **Identify Nodes**: Track the nodes which are out of order. There will be exactly two such nodes in a pair. The first occurrence of disorder will give the first node, and the second occurrence will give the second node (or the last correct node followed by the first incorrect one).
3. **Recover Tree**: Once we have identified the two nodes, swap their values to correct the BST.

### Code

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def recoverTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> None:
        # Variables to keep track of the two nodes to be swapped
        self.first = self.second = self.prev = None

        def inorder(node: TreeNode):
            if node is None:
                return
            
            # In-order traversal: left subtree
            inorder(node.left)
            
            # Identify the misplaced nodes
            if self.prev and self.prev.val > node.val:
                if not self.first:
                    self.first = self.prev
                self.second = node

            self.prev = node
            
            # In-order traversal: right subtree
            inorder(node.right)

        # Perform the in-order traversal
        inorder(root)

        # Swap the values of the two nodes to correct the tree
        if self.first and self.second:
            self.first.val, self.second.val = self.second.val, self.first.val

### Time Complexity
1. In-order Traversal: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
2. Space Complexity: O(h), where h is the height of the tree (due to recursion stack). For a balanced tree, h = O(log n). In the worst case (skewed tree), h = O(n).

Let's implement the provided code to solve this problem efficiently.
