title:  Distribute Elements Into Two Arrays I-out
permalink: /s3069
---

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. You have to distribute all the integers in the array into two arrays `array1` and `array2` while respecting the following conditions:

1. **Condition 1:** All elements of `nums` must be in either `array1` or `array2`.
2. **Condition 2:** The sum of elements in `array1` must be strictly greater than the sum of elements in `array2`.

Return the two arrays `array1` and `array2` such that the mentioned conditions are satisfied. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the size of `nums` and its elements?**
   - Typically, there are constraints in competitive programming problems, this helps in understanding if the given solution will perform efficiently within limits.
   
2. **Is there any preferred ordering for elements in the resultant arrays, or any other constraints?**
   - This helps us decide if we need to maintain some order while distributing the elements.

For now, we will assume general competitive programming constraints and no specific ordering required for results.

### Strategy

To tackle this problem I will:
1. **Sort** the array `nums` in descending order.
2. **Iterate** through the sorted array, and greedily distribute elements to `array1` until the sum of `array1` is greater than the remaining elements.
3. Place the rest of the elements into `array2`.

#### Steps:
1. Sort the array in descending order.
2. Initialize two lists: `array1` and `array2`, and their respective sums.
3. Traverse the sorted list and add elements to `array1` until its sum exceeds the remaining sum of elements.
4. Add remaining elements to `array2`.

This ensures we achieve a solution where `sum(array1)` is likely to be strictly greater than `sum(array2)`.

### Code

```python
def distribute_elements(nums):
    # Sort the array in descending order
    nums.sort(reverse=True)
    
    array1, array2 = [], []
    sum1, sum2 = 0, 0
    
    # Iterate over the array and distribute the elements
    for num in nums:
        if sum1 <= sum2:
            array1.append(num)
            sum1 += num
        else:
            array2.append(num)
            sum2 += num
            
    return array1, array2
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the array:** \( O(n \log n) \)
- **Iterating through the array:** \( O(n) \)

Thus, the overall time complexity is \( O(n \log n) \).

This approach ensures that we greedily achieve the required distribution while keeping the algorithm efficient in terms of both time and space complexity.
