title:  Remove Max Number of Edges to Keep Graph Fully Traversable-out
permalink: /s1579
---

Alice and Bob have an undirected graph of `n` nodes and `m` edges. Each edge is one of three types:

- Type 1: Can be traversed by Alice only.
- Type 2: Can be traversed by Bob only.
- Type 3: Can be traversed by both Alice and Bob.

Given an array `edges` of `m` edges where `edges[i] = [typei, ui, vi]` represents an edge of type `typei` between nodes `ui` and `vi`, your task is to remove the maximum number of edges such that the graph is still fully traversable by both Alice and Bob. The graph is fully traversable if starting from any node, Alice (or Bob) can reach all other nodes.

Return the maximum number of edges you can remove while still making sure the graph is fully traversable by both Alice and Bob. If it's impossible for the graph to be fully traversable by both, return -1.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Node Indexing**: Are nodes indexed starting from 1 or 0?
   - Nodes are indexed from 1 to `n`.

2. **Edge Consistency**: Can we assume that the edges list covers all node connections needed?
   - Yes, the edges list will include necessary connections, but not necessarily in a structured manner.

3. **Graph Connection Guarantee**: Is it guaranteed that the provided graph will initially be connected?
   - No, we need to check if it is possible to make the graph fully traversable for both Alice and Bob after removing some edges.

## Strategy

1. **Disjoint Set (Union-Find) Data Structure**: We will use the Union-Find data structure to manage connectivity.
2. **Edge Sorting**: Process edges of type 3 first because they are usable for both Alice and Bob and reduce the number of needed edges.
3. **Union Operations**: Perform union operations on the disjoint sets separately for Alice and Bob after processing the type-3 edges.
4. **Max Edges Removable**: Count the number of edges processed and infer the max removable edges as those that were not processed.

## Code

Here is the concrete implementation in Python:

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.parent = list(range(n))
        self.rank = [0] * n
        self.components = n
    
    def find(self, u):
        if self.parent[u] != u:
            self.parent[u] = self.find(self.parent[u])
        return self.parent[u]
    
    def union(self, u, v):
        root_u = self.find(u)
        root_v = self.find(v)
        if root_u != root_v:
            if self.rank[root_u] > self.rank[root_v]:
                self.parent[root_v] = root_u
            elif self.rank[root_u] < self.rank[root_v]:
                self.parent[root_u] = root_v
            else:
                self.parent[root_v] = root_u
                self.rank[root_u] += 1
            self.components -= 1
            return True
        return False

def maxNumEdgesToRemove(n, edges):
    uf_alice = UnionFind(n)
    uf_bob = UnionFind(n)
    
    edges.sort(key=lambda x: -x[0])  # Sort edges by type descending
    
    used_edges = 0
    
    # Process common edges (type 3) first
    for edge in edges:
        type, u, v = edge[0], edge[1] - 1, edge[2] - 1
        if type == 3:
            if uf_alice.union(u, v):
                uf_bob.union(u, v)
                used_edges += 1
                
    # Process Alice's edges (type 1)
    for edge in edges:
        type, u, v = edge[0], edge[1] - 1, edge[2] - 1
        if type == 1:
            if uf_alice.union(u, v):
                used_edges += 1
    
    # Process Bob's edges (type 2)
    for edge in edges:
        type, u, v = edge[0], edge[1] - 1, edge[2] - 1
        if type == 2:
            if uf_bob.union(u, v):
                used_edges += 1
    
    # Check if both graphs are fully traversable
    if uf_alice.components > 1 or uf_bob.components > 1:
        return -1

    return len(edges) - used_edges

```

## Time Complexity

- Sorting the edges takes O(m log m) where `m` is the number of edges.
- Each union-find operation is practically O(1) with path compression and union by rank.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(m log m) due to sorting being the dominant step.
