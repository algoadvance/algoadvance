title:  GCD Sort of an Array-out
permalink: /s1998
---

You are given an array of integers `nums`, and you want to sort it in non-decreasing order using a series of operations. In each operation, you can choose any two indices `i` and `j` such that `gcd(nums[i], nums[j]) > 1` and swap them. Return `true` if it is possible to sort the array, otherwise return `false`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints:**
   - What is the size range of the array `nums`?
   - What is the range of the elements in `nums`?

2. **Operations:**
   - Are we limited in the number of operations we can perform?

3. **Output:**
   - Are there any specific requirements on how the output should be presented (e.g., data type)?

## Strategy

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Each element of `nums` can be treated as a node in a graph.
   - An edge exists between two nodes `i` and `j` if `gcd(nums[i], nums[j]) > 1`.

2. **Connected Components:**
   - If two elements can be swapped, then they belong to the same connected component.
   - We need to check if, within each connected component, sorting the subarray formed by these elements will allow the array to be sorted globally.

3. **Union-Find Data Structure:**
   - Use Union-Find (or Disjoint Set Union, DSU) to manage the connected components.
   - Iterate through all pairs to build the connected components.

4. **Validation:**
   - Compare the connected components of the original array with those of the sorted array.
   - If, for each connected component in the sorted array, the component is the same as in the original array, then the array can be sorted.

## Time Complexity

- Building the graph with the gcd condition: \(O(n^2)\), but with optimization, it may be more efficient using a sieve-like approach.
- Union-Find operations are generally near \(O(1)\) due to path compression and union by rank.
- Sorting the array: \(O(n \log n)\).

## Code

```python
def gcd(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
    return a

def gcd_sortable(nums):
    from collections import defaultdict
    import math

    parent = {}

    def find(x):
        if parent[x] != x:
            parent[x] = find(parent[x])
        return parent[x]

    def union(x, y):
        rootX = find(x)
        rootY = find(y)
        if rootX != rootY:
            parent[rootX] = rootY

    # Initialize Union-Find
    for num in nums:
        parent[num] = num

    # Use gcd to union elements
    n = len(nums)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if gcd(nums[i], nums[j]) > 1:
                union(nums[i], nums[j])
    
    # Check if sorted array can be achievable by unioned components
    sorted_nums = sorted(nums)
    for num, sorted_num in zip(nums, sorted_nums):
        if find(num) != find(sorted_num):
            return False
    return True

# Test case
print(gcd_sortable([7, 21, 3]))  # Output should be True
print(gcd_sortable([10, 5, 9, 3, 15]))  # Output should be True
print(gcd_sortable([8, 4, 12, 2]))  # Output should be True
```

### Explanation

1. **GCD Calculation:**
   - Function `gcd(a, b)` computes the greatest common divisor.

2. **Union-Find Initialization:**
   - Initialize a `parent` dictionary where each number points to itself.

3. **Union Operation:**
   - Go through all pairs of numbers, if the `gcd(nums[i], nums[j]) > 1`, union their sets.

4. **Validation:**
   - Sort the array and check if each element in the sorted array belongs to the same connected component as in the original array.

This approach ensures that the array can be sorted using the given operations if the sorted version conforms to the same component structure.
