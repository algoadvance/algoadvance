title:  Minimize the Difference Between Target and Chosen Elements-out
permalink: /s1981
---

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `mat` and an integer `target`.

Choose one integer from each row in the matrix such that the absolute difference between `target` and the sum of the chosen elements is minimized.

Return the minimum absolute difference.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: mat = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], target = 13
Output: 0
Explanation: Choose 1 from the first row, 5 from the second row, and 7 from the third row.
The sum is 1 + 5 + 7 = 13, which equals the target, so the absolute difference is 0.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: mat = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], target = 30
Output: 9
Explanation: Choose 3 from the first row, 6 from the second row, and 9 from the third row.
The sum is 3 + 6 + 9 = 18, which is 12 less than 30 but no other method produces a sum closer to 30.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: mat = [[1,2,9],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], target = 20
Output: 1
Explanation: Choose 9 from the first row, 6 from the second row, and 5 from the third row.
The sum is 9 + 6 + 5 = 20, which equals the target, so the absolute difference is 1.
```

**Constraints:**

- `m == mat.length`
- `n == mat[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 70`
- `1 <= mat[i][j] <= 70`
- `1 <= target <= 800`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can elements in a given row be chosen more than once?
   - No, each element in a row can only be chosen once.

2. Should we consider the sum of all possible combinations of one element from each row?
   - Yes, we should minimize the absolute difference between the target and such sums.

3. Are the integers within the matrix guaranteed to be positive?
   - Yes, all integers are between 1 and 70 (inclusive).

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we will use a dynamic programming approach:

1. Use a Set to store the possible sums at each row to avoid redundant calculations.
2. Initialize the first set with the elements of the first row.
3. For each subsequent row, update the set by adding each element from the current row to each element in the set from the previous iteration.
4. After processing all rows, find the minimum absolute difference between any sum in the set and the target.
5. Return the minimum difference.

## Time Complexity
- The approach involves iterating over all elements of the matrix and combining sums, which is dependent on the matrix size and sums' range.
- Let \( m \) be the number of rows and \( n \) be the number of elements per row. The combined complexity of managing sums and updates will be relatively efficient within the constraints.

## Code

```python
def minimizeTheDifference(mat, target):
    # Initial possible sums set with elements from the first row
    current_sums = set(mat[0])
    
    # Process each row from the second row onwards
    for i in range(1, len(mat)):
        next_sums = set()
        for value in mat[i]:
            for current_sum in current_sums:
                next_sums.add(current_sum + value)
        current_sums = next_sums
    
    # Get the minimum absolute difference
    return min(abs(s - target) for s in current_sums)

# Example usage:
mat = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
target = 13
print(minimizeTheDifference(mat, target))  # Output: 0
```

This solution should account for all possible sums in a relatively efficient manner considering the constraints given.
