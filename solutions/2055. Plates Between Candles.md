title:  Plates Between Candles-out
permalink: /s2055
---

You are given a string `s` consisting of the characters `'*'` and `'|'`. Each `'*'` represents a plate and each `'|'` represents a candle. You are also given a list of pairs of integers `queries` where `queries[i] = [left_i, right_i]` represents an interval `[left_i, right_i]` (inclusive). For each query, you need to determine the number of plates between the candles that are within the query's interval.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the string and the query list?**
   - `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
   - `s` consists of `'*'` and `'|'` characters only.
   - `1 <= queries.length <= 10^5`
   - `0 <= left_i <= right_i < s.length`

2. **Is it guaranteed that there will always be at least one `'*'` or `'|'` in the string `s`?**
   - Yes, the string will always contain at least one character `'*'` or `'|'`.

3. **Are the queries overlapping or non-overlapping?**
   - The queries can be overlapping.

### Strategy

To efficiently solve this problem, we need to preprocess the string `s` in a few steps:

1. **Prefix Sum Array of Plates:**
   - Create a prefix sum array that counts the plates up to each index.

2. **Nearest Candle Arrays:**
   - Create two arrays to store the nearest candle to the left and the nearest candle to the right for each position in the string `s`.

3. **Query Processing:**
   - For each query, use the precomputed data to quickly find the number of plates between the nearest candles to the left and right within the specified interval.

### Detailed Steps

1. **Prefix Sum Array:**
   - Iterate through the string `s` and maintain a running count of `'*'` to create the prefix sum array.

2. **Nearest Candle Arrays:**
   - While iterating through the string, populate the nearest candle to the left and nearest candle to the right arrays.

3. **Answer Queries:**
   - For each query, use the nearest candle arrays to get the boundaries of the interval where candles enclose the segment. Use the prefix sum array to determine the number of plates between these candles.

### Implementation

```python
def platesBetweenCandles(s, queries):
    n = len(s)
    
    # Step 1: Prefix Sum of Plates
    prefix_sum = [0] * n
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '*':
            count += 1
        prefix_sum[i] = count

    # Step 2: Nearest Candle Arrays
    nearest_left_candle = [-1] * n
    nearest_right_candle = [-1] * n

    # Fill nearest_left_candle
    last_candle = -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == '|':
            last_candle = i
        nearest_left_candle[i] = last_candle

    # Fill nearest_right_candle
    last_candle = -1
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        if s[i] == '|':
            last_candle = i
        nearest_right_candle[i] = last_candle

    # Answer Queries
    result = []
    for left, right in queries:
        left_candle = nearest_right_candle[left]
        right_candle = nearest_left_candle[right]
        
        if left_candle == -1 or right_candle == -1 or left_candle >= right_candle:
            result.append(0)
        else:
            result.append(prefix_sum[right_candle] - prefix_sum[left_candle])

    return result
```

### Time Complexity

- Preprocessing (prefix sum, nearest left, nearest right): `O(n)`
- Query processing: Each query processed in `O(1)`
- Total time complexity: `O(n + q)`, where `n` is the length of the string and `q` is the number of queries.

This approach ensures that we efficiently handle even the largest inputs within allowable constraints.
