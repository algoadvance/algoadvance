title:  The Number of Beautiful Subsets-out
permalink: /s2597
---

### Problem Statement

Let's break down the original problem statement as it might be:

Given an array of positive integers `nums` and an integer `k`, find the number of "beautiful" subsets of `nums`.

A subset is defined as "beautiful" if the absolute difference between any two chosen elements in the subset is exactly `k`.

**Constraints**:
1. `1 <= nums.length <= 20`
2. `1 <= nums[i], k <= 1000`

A subset must have at least two elements to be considered beautiful.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Subsets without specific ordering**: Should we count permutations of subsets as the same single set?
2. **Minimum subset size**: Do subsets need to have at least two elements to be considered?
3. **Duplicate elements**: Are duplicate elements in `nums` allowed, and should different occurrences of the same number be treated uniquely?

### Code

```python
from itertools import combinations

def count_beautiful_subsets(nums, k):
    def is_beautiful(subset):
        # Check if all pairs in the subset have an absolute difference of exactly k
        for i in range(len(subset)):
            for j in range(i + 1, len(subset)):
                if abs(subset[i] - subset[j]) != k:
                    return False
        return True

    n = len(nums)
    count = 0
    
    # Generate all possible subsets
    for size in range(2, n + 1):  # start from size 2 to be a meaningful subset
        for subset in combinations(nums, size):
            if is_beautiful(subset):
                count += 1
    
    return count

# Sample Usage
nums = [2, 4, 6]
k = 2
print(count_beautiful_subsets(nums, k))
```

### Strategy

1. **Generate Subsets**: Use Python's `itertools.combinations` to generate all possible subsets of different sizes (at least 2 elements).
2. **Check Beautiful Condition**: For each subset, check if it's "beautiful" by ensuring that the absolute difference between any two elements equals `k`.
3. **Count Beautiful Subsets**: If a subset meets the condition, increment the count.

### Time Complexity

The solution involves:
1. Generating all possible subsets of the array `nums`.
   - The total number of subsets that can be generated from an array of size `n` is \(2^n\). However, since we are only interested in subsets of at least size 2, the combinations for us are \(\sum_{i=2}^{n} \binom{n}{i}\), which is still \(O(2^n)\) in terms of combinations generation since we have to consider a power set.
2. Checking each subset for the "beautiful" condition.
   - Checking involves comparing each pair of elements in a subset, and in the worst case would be \(O(n^2)\).

Together, the combined time complexity is approximately \(O(2^n \cdot n^2)\), dominated by the subset generation \(2^n\) aspect.

Remember to consider optimization should the constraints increase or if performance is critical for larger inputs.
