title:  Minimum Operations to Halve Array Sum-out
permalink: /s2208
---

The problem requires you to determine the minimum number of operations to reduce the sum of an array to at most half of its original value. In each operation, you can select any element from the array and halve it (reduce it to half its original value).

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - No, as per the problem description, the array consists of positive integers.

2. **In each operation, can we pick any element or is there a specific order?**
   - Any element can be picked in any operation.

3. **Is the output the exact count of operations needed or we need to return something else?**
   - The output should be the exact count of operations needed to achieve the condition.

## Strategy

1. **Initial Sum Calculation:** Calculate the initial sum of the array.
2. **Target Sum Calculation:** Compute the target sum which is half of the initial sum.
3. **Utilize a Max-Heap:** To effectively reduce the sum, use a max-heap (priority queue) to consistently halve the largest remaining elements because halving larger numbers will initially reduce the sum more significantly.
4. **Halving Elements:** Continuously extract the maximum element, halve it, and push it back into the max-heap while updating the reduced sum and counting operations.
5. **Check for Condition:** Repeat the above step until the total reduced sum is less than or equal to target sum.

## Code

```python
import heapq

def minOperations(nums):
    # Convert all elements to negative to use Python's min-heap as a max-heap
    max_heap = [-x for x in nums]
    heapq.heapify(max_heap)
    
    initial_sum = sum(nums)
    target_sum = initial_sum / 2
    
    reduced_sum = initial_sum
    operations = 0
    
    # Continue until the reduced sum is less than or equal to half the initial sum
    while reduced_sum > target_sum:
        # Extract max element (invert sign back to positive)
        largest = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)
        # Halve the max element
        half = largest / 2
        reduced_sum -= half
        
        # Push the half value back into the max-heap (invert to negative)
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, -half)
        
        # Increment the operation count
        operations += 1
    
    return operations

# Example Usage:
nums = [10,20,40]
print(minOperations(nums))  # Output will be the number of operations required
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Heap Operations:** In each iteration, we perform an extraction and insertion in the heap, both of which have a time complexity of \(O(\log n)\).
2. **Loop Execution Count:** The number of iterations depends on how the sum reduces but will roughly be proportional to the logarithm of the initial sum since we keep halving the largest values.

Thus, the **Overall Time Complexity** is \(O(n \log n) + O(m \log n)\), where \(m\) is the number of operations until the sum condition is satisfied. This will dominantly be \(O(m \log n)\) if \(m\) is large, but in practical scenarios, it will be efficient.
