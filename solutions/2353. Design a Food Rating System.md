title:  Design a Food Rating System-out
permalink: /s2353
---

Design a food rating system that allows for querying and updating food ratings efficiently. You need to implement a class `FoodRatings` with the following methods:

- `__init__(self, foods: List[str], cuisines: List[str], ratings: List[int])`: Initializes the system. Every food has a name, a cuisine, and a rating.
- `changeRating(self, food: str, newRating: int)`: Changes the rating of the specified food to the new rating.
- `highestRated(self, cuisine: str) -> str`: Returns the highest-rated food for the specified cuisine. If there is a tie, return the lexicographically smaller food name.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Will there be unique food names?
   - Yes, food names are unique.
2. Can we assume that each food belongs only to one cuisine?
   - Yes, every food belongs to exactly one cuisine.
3. Are the food ratings only positive integers?
   - Yes, ratings are positive integers.
4. Is it safe to assume that there will always be at least one food when querying `highestRated`?
   - Yes, you can assume there is always at least one food for any queried cuisine.

## Strategy

To achieve efficient changes and queries:
1. We'll maintain a dictionary with food items and their details.
2. We'll use a `SortedList` for each cuisine to maintain the highest-rated foods in sorted order efficiently.

Steps:
1. Initialize a dictionary `food_info` to store the food's rating and cuisine.
2. Initialize another dictionary `cuisine_ratings` where keys are cuisine names and values are `SortedList` instances containing tuples of `(-rating, food_name)` for the foods.
3. For `changeRating`, update the rating in `food_info`, remove the old entry from `SortedList`, and insert the new one.
4. For `highestRated`, simply return the first element of the `SortedList` for the given cuisine (after dealing with ties lexicographically).

## Code

```python
from sortedcontainers import SortedList
from collections import defaultdict

class FoodRatings:
    def __init__(self, foods, cuisines, ratings):
        self.food_info = {}
        self.cuisine_ratings = defaultdict(SortedList)
        
        for food, cuisine, rating in zip(foods, cuisines, ratings):
            self.food_info[food] = (cuisine, rating)
            self.cuisine_ratings[cuisine].add((-rating, food))

    def changeRating(self, food, newRating):
        cuisine, oldRating = self.food_info[food]
        self.cuisine_ratings[cuisine].remove((-oldRating, food))
        self.cuisine_ratings[cuisine].add((-newRating, food))
        self.food_info[food] = (cuisine, newRating)

    def highestRated(self, cuisine):
        return self.cuisine_ratings[cuisine][0][1]

# Example Usage
foods = ["kimchi", "miso", "sushi"]
cuisines = ["korean", "japanese", "japanese"]
ratings = [9, 12, 15]

food_ratings = FoodRatings(foods, cuisines, ratings)
print(food_ratings.highestRated("japanese"))  # Should return "sushi"
food_ratings.changeRating("sushi", 10)
print(food_ratings.highestRated("japanese"))  # Should return "miso"
```

## Time Complexity

- `__init__`: O(n log n), where n is the number of foods, primarily due to the insertion into the `SortedList`.
- `changeRating`: O(log n), where n is the number of foods in a specific cuisine due to removing and adding elements in the `SortedList`.
- `highestRated`: O(1), since we only access the first element in the `SortedList`.

This approach ensures that querying and updating the food ratings are efficient.
