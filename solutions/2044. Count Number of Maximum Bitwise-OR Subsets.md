title:  Count Number of Maximum Bitwise-OR Subsets-out
permalink: /s2044
---

In this problem, you are given an integer array `nums`. You need to find the number of non-empty subsets of `nums` such that the bitwise OR of all the elements in the subset is equal to the maximum possible bitwise OR value that can be obtained by OR-ing all elements of `nums`.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: The maximum possible bitwise OR is 3. There are 2 subsets with a bitwise OR equal to 3 ([3] and [3, 1]).
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - No, as the problem specifies an integer array and bitwise operations are typically done on non-negative integers.
   
2. **What is the maximum size of the array?**
   - This typically affects the feasibility of certain approaches, but we'll assume we can check larger sizes using constraints mentioned in the problem.

3. **Can elements be repeated in the array?**
   - Yes, the array may contain duplicates.

## Strategy

### Step-by-Step Solution:
1. **Calculate the Maximum Bitwise OR:**
   - Traverse the array to find the maximum bitwise OR value possible by OR-ing all elements.

2. **Backtracking to Find Valid Subsets:**
   - Use backtracking to explore all possible subsets of the array.
   - Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of subsets that match the maximum bitwise OR value.
   - Iterate through the array and keep OR-ing the current subset.
   - If the current subset's OR matches the maximum OR, increment the counter.

### Points to Consider:
- Ensure to generate only non-empty subsets.
- Use backtracking to generate all possible subsets and check their OR values.

## Code

Here is the Python implementation of the above strategy:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def countMaxOrSubsets(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        # Calculate the maximum possible bitwise OR value
        max_or = 0
        for num in nums:
            max_or |= num
        
        # Initialize the counter for subsets that match max_or
        count = 0
        
        def backtrack(index, current_or):
            nonlocal count
            if index == len(nums):
                if current_or == max_or:
                    count += 1
                return
            
            # Include nums[index] in the current subset
            backtrack(index + 1, current_or | nums[index])
            
            # Exclude nums[index] from the current subset
            backtrack(index + 1, current_or)
        
        # Start backtracking from the first element
        backtrack(0, 0)
        
        return count
```

## Time Complexity:
- **O(2^n)**: In the worst case, we are generating all possible subsets of the array, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. Each subset computation involves constant-time bitwise OR operations.
  
- **Space Complexity**: 
  - **O(n)** for the recursion stack in the backtracking process, where `n` is the length of the array.

This implementation uses a backtracking approach to find non-empty subsets and count the ones that match the maximum bitwise OR value.
