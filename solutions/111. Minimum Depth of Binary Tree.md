title:  Minimum Depth of Binary Tree-out
permalink: /s111
---
The problem requires us to find the minimum depth of a binary tree. The minimum depth is the number of nodes along the shortest path from the root node down to the nearest leaf node.

A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

```
Given binary tree [3,9,20,null,null,15,7],
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
Return its minimum depth = 2.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be the output if the tree is empty?**
   - If the tree is empty, the minimum depth should be `0`.

2. **What is the expected input format?**
   - The input will be the root of a binary tree node, where each node has properties `val`, `left`, and `right`.

3. **Can the binary tree contain duplicate values?**
   - Yes, the tree can contain duplicate values.

### Strategy
1. **Recursive Depth-First Search (DFS) Approach:**
   - The algorithm will traverse the tree to find the minimum depth.
   - Base Case: If the current node is `None`, return `0` as this does not contribute to the depth.
   - If the node is a leaf (both left and right children are `None`), return `1`.
   - Recursively find the minimum depth of the left subtree and the right subtree.
   - If one of the children is `None`, ignore it and return the depth of the non-`None` subtree.
   - Return the minimum of the left and right subtree depths plus `1` for the current node.

### Code
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def minDepth(root: TreeNode) -> int:
    if not root:
        return 0

    # If left subtree is None, then the minimum depth must be found in the right subtree
    if not root.left:
        return minDepth(root.right) + 1
    
    # If right subtree is None, then the minimum depth must be found in the left subtree
    if not root.right:
        return minDepth(root.left) + 1
    
    # If both subtree exists, find the minimal path from both subtrees
    return min(minDepth(root.left), minDepth(root.right)) + 1
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is **O(N)**, where `N` is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because in the worst case, the algorithm will visit each node once.
- The space complexity is **O(H)**, where `H` is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursion stack used during the depth-first traversal. In the worst-case scenario of a skewed tree, this could be `O(N)`.
