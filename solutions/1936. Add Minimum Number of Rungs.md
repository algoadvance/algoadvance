title:  Add Minimum Number of Rungs-out
permalink: /s1936
---

You are given a strictly increasing integer array `rungs` that represents the height of the rungs on a ladder. You are currently on the ground at height `0`, and you want to reach the top of the ladder, which is at the last rung in the list.

You can only climb to the next highest rung if the difference between the current height and the next rung is at most `k`. You are given a positive integer `k`.

Return the minimum number of rungs you need to add to this ladder in order for you to be able to climb to the last rung.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Input:**
   - What is the range of the lengths of the `rungs` array?
   - What are the possible values for the heights in `rungs` and for `k`?

2. **Constraints:**
   - Can the `rungs` array contain duplicate elements?
   - Is the input guaranteed to be sorted and strictly increasing?

Assuming standard constraints based on typical interview problems:
- The length of `rungs` is between 1 and 10^5.
- Each height in `rungs` is between 1 and 10^9.
- The integer `k` is between 1 and 10^9.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Current Height:**
   Begin at height `0`.

2. **Iterate Through Rungs:**
   Loop through the list of rungs and check the difference between the current height and the next rung's height.

3. **Determine Additional Rungs:**
   For each gap between the current height and the next rung that exceeds `k`, add enough rungs so that each rung-to-be-added is at most `k` apart.

4. **Update Current Height:**
   Move the current height to the next rung after handling any necessary additions.

5. **Count Additional Rungs:**
   Track the total number of rungs added.

### Time Complexity

- The algorithm iterates through the `rungs` array once, leading to a time complexity of \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in `rungs`.

### Code

```python
def addRungs(rungs, k):
    current_height = 0
    additional_rungs = 0
    
    for rung in rungs:
        if rung - current_height > k:
            distance = rung - current_height
            # Number of additional rungs needed to make each step <= k
            additional_rungs += (distance - 1) // k
        
        # Update current height to the current rung
        current_height = rung
    
    return additional_rungs

# Example usage:
rungs = [1, 3, 5, 10]
k = 2
print(addRungs(rungs, k))  # Output should be 2
```

### Explanation of Example

- Start at height `0`.
- The first rung is at height `1`. The difference is `1`, which is within the limit `k=2`. Move to height `1`.
- The next rung is at height `3`. The difference is `2`, which is exactly `k`. Move to height `3`.
- The next rung is at height `5`. The difference is again `2`. Move to height `5`.
- The next rung is at height `10`. The difference is `5`, which exceeds `k`. Calculate `additional_rungs` needed: `(5 - 1) // 2 = 2`.

So, a total of `2` additional rungs are needed.
