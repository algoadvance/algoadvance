title:  Valid Mountain Array-out
permalink: /s941
---

Given an array of integers `arr`, return `true` if and only if it is a valid mountain array.

Recall that arr is a mountain array if and only if:

1. `arr.length >= 3`
2. There exists some `i` with `0 < i < arr.length - 1` such that:
   - `arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]`
   - `arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array have duplicate elements?**
   - No, as per the problem definition, a valid mountain array must strictly increase and then strictly decrease, implying no duplicates that disrupt this pattern.
  
2. **Is the peak in the middle of the array?**
   - Yes, the peak must be somewhere in the array such that it splits the array into a strictly increasing part followed by a strictly decreasing part.

3. **Should the array be traversed more than once?**
   - Ideally, a single pass through the array would be optimal for checking the conditions.

## Strategy

1. **Initial Checks:**
   - If the array length is less than 3, return `false` as it cannot form a mountain array.

2. **Two-pointer Strategy:**
   - Use two pointers starting from 0 and the end of the array respectively, and move towards the center while checking the increasing and decreasing parts of the mountain array.
   - Move the left pointer until it no longer forms a strictly increasing sequence.
   - Move the right pointer until it no longer forms a strictly decreasing sequence.
   - A valid mountain array will have the left and right pointers meeting at the same peak index.

## Code

```python
def validMountainArray(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n < 3:
        return False

    left, right = 0, n - 1

    # Climb up from left
    while left + 1 < n and arr[left] < arr[left + 1]:
        left += 1

    # Climb up from right
    while right - 1 >= 0 and arr[right] < arr[right - 1]:
        right -= 1

    # left and right should point to the same peak index
    return left > 0 and right < n - 1 and left == right

# Example usage
arr = [2, 1]
print(validMountainArray(arr))  # Output: False

arr = [3, 5, 5]
print(validMountainArray(arr))  # Output: False

arr = [0, 3, 2, 1]
print(validMountainArray(arr))  # Output: True
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array. We traverse the array with two pointers in a single pass.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as we use a constant amount of additional memory regardless of the input size.
