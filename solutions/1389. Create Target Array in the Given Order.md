title:  Create Target Array in the Given Order-out
permalink: /s1389
---

We are given two arrays `nums` and `index`. We need to create a target array under the following conditions:

1. Initially, the target array is empty.
2. We process the `nums` array one element at a time along with the corresponding element in the `index` array.
3. For each element in `nums`, we insert it at the position specified in the corresponding element in `index`.

Finally, we need to return the target array.

**Example:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,2,3,4], index = [0,1,2,2,1]
Output: [0,4,1,3,2]
```

**Constraints:**

- `nums` is an array with distinct integers.
- `index` has the same length as `nums`.
- The elements in `index` are valid indices of the target array when elements are inserted progressively.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume that every element in `index` is within the valid range of the current target array's length?
    - Yes, the problem guarantees this.
2. Is it required to handle any special input cases (like empty `nums` and `index` arrays)?
    - No, we assume the inputs are always valid as per the problem constraints.

## Strategy

We can iterate over the elements of `nums` and `index`. For each element in `nums`, we use the corresponding `index` to determine where to insert the element in the target array. Python's list `insert` method will be used for this purpose, as it handles the insertion of an element at a specified position directly.

Here is the step-by-step strategy:
1. Initialize an empty target array.
2. Iterate through the elements of `nums` and `index` together.
3. For each pair `(num, idx)`, use the `insert` method to insert `num` at position `idx` in the target array.
4. Continue until all elements are processed.
5. Return the target array.

## Code

```python
def createTargetArray(nums, index):
    target = []
    for num, idx in zip(nums, index):
        target.insert(idx, num)
    return target
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the `insert` method in a list is O(n) in the worst case, because elements might need to be shifted to make room for the new element. Given this, if we are inserting `n` elements one by one, the overall time complexity will be:

- O(n^2) due to the repeated insertion operation.

This is acceptable within reason for smaller value ranges of `nums` and `index`, as typically posed in coding interview problems.

## Example Execution

Let's run through the provided example:

```python
# Test the function with the given example
nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
index = [0, 1, 2, 2, 1]

print(createTargetArray(nums, index))  # Output should be [0, 4, 1, 3, 2]
```

This completes the problem-solving process for the given task.
