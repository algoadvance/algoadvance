title:  Egg Drop With 2 Eggs and N Floors-out
permalink: /s1884
---

You are given `n` floors and `2` eggs. Your task is to determine the minimum number of attempts required in the worst case to find the highest floor from which an egg can be dropped without breaking. 

If an egg breaks upon dropping from a certain floor, it means it would also break from any floor above that. If an egg does not break, it means it would not break if dropped from any floor below that one. 

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= n <= 1000

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Does the egg drop problem obey the general rules?**
    - For instance, if an egg breaks on floor `k`, then it will also break on any floor above `k`.
    - If an egg does not break on floor `k`, it will not break on any floor below `k`.

   `Yes`

2. **Are we guaranteed to have exactly 2 eggs available for the entire problem?**
   
   `Yes`

## Strategy

This classic problem can be tackled effectively using dynamic programming. Let's use a 2D list `dp` where `dp[x][y]` represents the minimum number of attempts required with `x` eggs and `y` floors. 

**Step-by-Step Solution:**

1. **Base Cases:**
   - If we have `0` floors, then we need `0` attempts irrespective of the number of eggs.
   - If we have `1` floor, then we need `1` attempt irrespective of the number of eggs.
   - If we have only `1` egg, then we need `y` attempts for `y` floors (we have to do linear search).

2. **General Case:**
   For every combination of eggs and floors:
   - Drop the egg from every floor from `1` to `k` and take the maximum number of attempts needed.
   - Use the following state transition:
     \[
     dp[2][k] = 1 + \min \left( \max(dp[1][x-1], dp[2][k-x]) \right) \text{ for all } x \text{ from } 1 \text{ to } k
     \]
   Here, \( x \) represents the current floor we are testing:
   - `dp[1][x-1]` is the case when the egg breaks.
   - `dp[2][k-x]` is the case when the egg does not break.
   - We try all floors and take the minimum of these maximum values to ensure we are minimizing our worst-case scenario.

## Code

```python
def twoEggDrop(n: int) -> int:
    # Initialize dp array
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(3)]
    
    # Base cases initialization
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[1][i] = i
        dp[2][i] = float('inf')
    
    # Fill dp for 2 eggs
    for k in range(1, n + 1):
        for x in range(1, k + 1):
            dp[2][k] = min(dp[2][k], 1 + max(dp[1][x-1], dp[2][k-x]))
    
    return dp[2][n]
```

## Time Complexity

- The above solution has a time complexity of `O(n^2)` due to the double nested loop (for each floor, testing every possible drop floor).
- Space complexity is `O(n)` for storing the results in the dp table.

This approach ensures we efficiently solve the problem within the imposed constraints (1 <= n <= 1000).
