title:  Vowel Spellchecker-out
permalink: /s966
---

Given a wordlist, we want to implement a spellchecker that converts specific queries to their correct form as per certain rules. The spellchecker works based on the following rules, applied in order:

1. **Exact match:** If the query matches exactly a word in the wordlist, return the query.
2. **Case-insensitive match:** If there is an exact match with the case ignored, return the word from the wordlist.
3. **Vowel error match:** If there is a match ignoring vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' replaced by a wildcard character, say '*'), return the word from the wordlist.
4. If none of the previous rules match, return an empty string.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Case Sensitivity**: When handling case-insensitive matches, should the original form of the query be returned or the wordlist form?
   - *Return the word from the wordlist.*

2. **Vowel Handling**: When handling vowel replacement, should only specific characters be replaced, or should any vowels be taken as the same?
   - *Only specific vowels (a, e, i, o, u) should be treated as the same, regardless of their case.*

3. **Return Types**: Should the results be returned as a list of strings, where each entry corresponds to a query?
   - *Yes, return a list of corrected words corresponding to each query, or an empty string if no match is found.*

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we will:

1. **Preprocess** the wordlist to store structures that allow efficient query lookups:
   - An exact match dictionary.
   - A case-insensitive match dictionary.
   - A vowel-error match dictionary.

2. **Query Processing**:
   - For each query, check if it matches exactly.
   - If not, check for a case-insensitive match.
   - If still no match, check using the vowel error strategy.
   - Return results in a new list.

## Code

```python
def spellchecker(wordlist, queries):
    def devowel(word):
        return ''.join('*' if char in 'aeiouAEIOU' else char for char in word)

    exact_match = set(wordlist)
    case_insensitive_match = {}
    vowel_error_match = {}

    for word in wordlist:
        # Case insensitive dictionary
        lowercase_word = word.lower()
        if lowercase_word not in case_insensitive_match:
            case_insensitive_match[lowercase_word] = word
        
        # Vowel error dictionary
        devoweled_word = devowel(lowercase_word)
        if devoweled_word not in vowel_error_match:
            vowel_error_match[devoweled_word] = word

    results = []
    for query in queries:
        if query in exact_match:
            results.append(query)
        else:
            lowercase_query = query.lower()
            devoweled_query = devowel(lowercase_query)
            
            if lowercase_query in case_insensitive_match:
                results.append(case_insensitive_match[lowercase_query])
            elif devoweled_query in vowel_error_match:
                results.append(vowel_error_match[devoweled_query])
            else:
                results.append('')
    
    return results
```

## Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing the wordlist**: 
  - Exact match storage: `O(N)` where `N` is the number of words in the wordlist.
  - Case-insensitive matches: `O(N * M)` where `M` is the average length of the words.
  - Vowel error matches: `O(N * M)` for converting words by replacing vowels.

- **Query Processing**:
  - For each query, checking exact matches, case-insensitive matches, and vowel-error matches involve light operations: `O(Q * M)` where `Q` is the number of queries and `M` is the average length of the queries.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(N * M + Q * M)`, which is efficient given usual constraints.
