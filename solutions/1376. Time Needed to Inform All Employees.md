title:  Time Needed to Inform All Employees-out
permalink: /s1376
---

We have a company with `n` employees, each with a unique ID from `0` to `n-1`. The head of the company has an ID `headID`.

Each employee has a direct manager, and is represented by an array `manager` where `manager[i]` is the manager of the `i-th` employee. The head of the company has no manager; hence `manager[headID]` = -1.

Additionally, each employee needs a certain amount of time to inform all their subordinates (if any) about an urgent message. This is represented by an array `informTime` where `informTime[i]` is the time required for the `i-th` employee to inform all their direct subordinates. 

We need to find the minimum time required to inform all the employees.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Question:** Is it guaranteed that the structure of the company forms a tree?
   **Answer:** Yes, it's guaranteed in the problem's constraints.
   
2. **Question:** What is the range of values for `n`?
   **Answer:** The value of `n` is up to `10^4`.

3. **Question:** Are the array elements of `manager` and `informTime` non-negative integers?
   **Answer:** Yes, they are non-negative, with `manager` containing `-1` only for the `headID`.

4. **Question:** Is it possible for an employee to not have any subordinates?
   **Answer:** Yes, employees may not have any subordinates.

### Strategy

We'll use a Depth-First Search (DFS) algorithm to traverse the hierarchical tree of employees.

1. **Building the Adjacency List:** We need to build an adjacency list from the `manager` list to easily find subordinates for each employee.
2. **DFS Traversal:** Start the DFS traversal from the `headID` and accumulate the maximum time required to inform all employees down the hierarchy. For each employee, the total inform time will be their inform time plus the maximum time needed by their subordinates.

### Code

```python
def numOfMinutes(n, headID, manager, informTime):
    from collections import defaultdict

    # Build the adjacency list: a manager -> subordinates map
    subordinates = defaultdict(list)
    for emp_id, mgr_id in enumerate(manager):
        if mgr_id != -1:  # skip the head
            subordinates[mgr_id].append(emp_id)

    def dfs(emp_id):
        max_time = 0
        for sub_id in subordinates[emp_id]:
            max_time = max(max_time, dfs(sub_id))
        return informTime[emp_id] + max_time

    return dfs(headID)

# Example test case
n = 7
headID = 6
manager = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, -1]
informTime = [0, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]

print(numOfMinutes(n, headID, manager, informTime))  # Output should be 21
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Building the Adjacency List:** This takes O(n) time, where `n` is the number of employees.
2. **DFS Traversal:** Each employee and their subordinates are visited once in a depth-first manner, resulting in O(n) time complexity.

**Overall Time Complexity:** O(n)

This complexity is efficient given the constraints, and ensures that we process each employee exactly once making optimal use of resources.
