title:  Positions of Large Groups-out
permalink: /s830
---

The problem "Positions of Large Groups" on LeetCode (#830) can be stated as follows:

You are given a string `s` of lowercase English letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order. A "large group" is a group of 3 or more consecutive characters that are the same.

Your task is to return a list of the starting and ending positions of every large group. The answer should be in the form of a list of lists.

**Example:**
```python
Input: s = "abbxxxxzzy"
Output: [[3, 6]]
Explanation: "xxxx" is the only large group with starting index 3 and ending index 6.
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions

Before proceeding, letâ€™s ensure all details are cleared:
1. **Q:** Can the string `s` contain any characters other than lowercase English letters?
   - **A:** No, it only contains lowercase English letters.
2. **Q:** Should overlapping groups be considered distinctly?
   - **A:** Overlapping is not an issue since each character is part of at most one group.

## Strategy

1. **Initialization:** Initialize an empty result list to store the positions of all large groups.
2. **Iteration:** Use a pointer to traverse the string while keeping track of the start and end of the current group of characters.
3. **Check Group Size:** For each group of consecutive same characters, if the length is 3 or more, add the start and end indices to the result list.
4. **Edge Cases:** Make sure to handle the end of the string and any small lengths input.

## Code

```python
def largeGroupPositions(s: str):
    result = []
    i = 0
    n = len(s)
    
    while i < n:
        start = i
        while i < n and s[i] == s[start]:
            i += 1
        # Now s[start:i] is the large group we are checking
        if i - start >= 3:
            result.append([start, i - 1])
    return result
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because we only traverse the string once with a single loop. The space complexity is **O(1)** if we don't account for the space used to store the result list, and **O(k)** where `k` is the number of large groups when including the output space.

By following this approach, we ensure that all edge cases are covered efficiently while maintaining optimal time complexity.
