title:  Middle of the Linked List-out
permalink: /s876
---

You are given the head of a singly linked list. Return the middle node of the linked list.

If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: What are the constraints on the number of nodes in the linked list?
   - The number of nodes in the list is in the range `[1, 100]`.

2. **Node Structure**: What does a node of the linked list look like?
   - Each node has an `int` value and a `next` reference to the next node in the list, or `null` if it is the last node.

3. **Return Type**: Should the function return the entire list starting from the middle node or just the middle node's value?
   - The function should return the entire list starting from the middle node.

4. **Edge Cases**: How do we handle edge cases like a single-node list or an even number of nodes?
   - For a single-node list, the same node should be returned.
   - For an even number of nodes, the second middle node should be returned.

### Code

Here is the code to find the middle of the linked list:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def middleNode(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    slow = fast = head
    
    # Traverse the list with two pointers at different speeds
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        
    return slow
```

### Strategy

The strategy to solve this problem uses the **Two Pointers** approach:

1. **Two Pointers Initialization**:
   - Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both pointing to the start of the linked list.

2. **Traversal**:
   - Move the `slow` pointer one step at a time.
   - Move the `fast` pointer two steps at a time.

3. **Finding the Middle**:
   - By the time the `fast` pointer reaches the end of the list, the `slow` pointer will be at the middle of the list.
   - This works because the `fast` pointer moves twice as fast as the `slow` pointer, so when `fast` reaches the end, `slow` will have covered half the distance.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the list has only one node, `slow` will already be at the middle (and start).
   - If the list has an even number of nodes, `slow` will end up at the second middle node when `fast` reaches the end.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- **Reason**: Both `slow` and `fast` pointers traverse the list, but since `fast` moves twice as fast, the loop will terminate after `n/2` iterations, which is still **O(n)**.

The space complexity is **O(1)** because we are using only a fixed amount of extra space (i.e., the two pointers).

### Summary

- **Two Pointers** technique efficiently finds the middle node on a single pass through the list.
- It handles both odd and even sized lists correctly.
- The solution is optimal with **O(n)** time complexity and **O(1)** space complexity.
