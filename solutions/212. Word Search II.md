Given an `m x n` board of characters and a list of strings `words`, return all words on the board. Each word must be constructed from letters of sequentially adjacent cells, where "adjacent" cells are those horizontally or vertically neighboring. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

### Example:
```python
Input: board = [["o","a","a","n"],
                ["e","t","a","e"],
                ["i","h","k","r"],
                ["i","f","l","v"]],
       words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]
Output: ["eat","oath"]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can words overlap?**
   - Yes, they can overlap as long as the same letter cell is not reused in a single word's construction.
2. **Are the words case-sensitive?**
   - Yes, words are typically case-sensitive.
3. **Can the board contain duplicate characters?**
   - Yes, the board can have duplicate characters.

## Strategy

The problem is a combination of Trie (Prefix Tree) construction and Backtracking.

### Steps:

1. **Construct a Trie**: To facilitate quick prefix searching, build a Trie from the given list of words.
2. **Backtracking to search words**: For each cell in the board, initiate a backtracking search. If the cell matches the start of any word in the Trie, continue searching its neighbors (up, down, left, right).
3. **Track visited cells**: Use a set to keep track of visited cells to avoid reusing them in constructing a word.

### Code

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_end_of_word = False
        self.word = None

def build_trie(words):
    root = TrieNode()
    for word in words:
        node = root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                node.children[char] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[char]
        node.is_end_of_word = True
        node.word = word
    return root

def find_words(board, words):
    def backtrack(node, row, col):
        letter = board[row][col]
        curr_node = node.children[letter]
        
        if curr_node.is_end_of_word:
            result.add(curr_node.word)
        
        # Mark the cell as visited by changing the letter
        tmp, board[row][col] = board[row][col], '#'
        
        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            new_row, new_col = row + dx, col + dy
            
            if 0 <= new_row < len(board) and 0 <= new_col < len(board[0]) and board[new_row][new_col] != '#' and board[new_row][new_col] in curr_node.children:
                backtrack(curr_node, new_row, new_col)
        
        # Restore the cell's letter
        board[row][col] = tmp
    
    result = set()
    trie_root = build_trie(words)
    
    for row in range(len(board)):
        for col in range(len(board[0])):
            if board[row][col] in trie_root.children:
                backtrack(trie_root, row, col)
    
    return list(result)

# Example usage:
board = [["o","a","a","n"],
         ["e","t","a","e"],
         ["i","h","k","r"],
         ["i","f","l","v"]]
words = ["oath","pea","eat","rain"]

print(find_words(board, words))  # Output: ["oath", "eat"]
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Trie Construction**: \(O(W \times L)\), where \(W\) is the number of words and \(L\) is the length of the longest word.
2. **Backtracking**: The worst-case scenario involves traversing each cell in the board and exploring all possible paths: \(O(M \times N \times 4^L)\) where \(M\) is the number of rows, \(N\) is the number of columns, and \(L\) is the length of the longest word.

Overall time complexity is predominantly determined by the backtracking part, i.e., \(O(M \times N \times 4^L)\).

This combination of Trie and Backtracking ensures efficient prefix searching and word matching.
