title:  Number of Zero-Filled Subarrays-out
permalink: /s2348

Leetcode problem [2348. Number of Zero-Filled Subarrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-zero-filled-subarrays/) requires solving the following:

Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of subarrays filled with 0.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,3,0,0,2,0,0,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
There are 6 subarrays filled with 0: [0], [0], [0, 0], [0], [0], and [0, 0].
```

### Constraints
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- -10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9

---

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input constraints**: Can we guarantee that the input array contains at least one 0?
   - No, there's no such guarantee. The array may contain no zeroes at all.
2. **Element uniqueness**: Do the elements need to be unique?
   - No, there is no requirement for uniqueness of elements.
3. **Output format**: Should the result be a single integer?
   - Yes, the output is a single integer representing the count of zero-filled subarrays.

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we need to identify all the contiguous subarrays filled with 0's. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Iterate through the array**: Traverse the `nums` array.
2. **Count contiguous zeroes**: Whenever a sequence of zeroes is detected, compute the number of subarrays that can be formed with that sequence.
3. **Sum up subarrays**: Add the number of zero-filled subarrays for each contiguous zero sequence found.

**Counting zero-filled subarrays**:
   - For a segment of `n` consecutive zeroes, the number of subarrays can be calculated by the sum of the first `n` natural numbers: `n * (n + 1) // 2`.

### Pseudocode:
1. Initialize count variables to keep track of current zero segment length and total subarrays.
2. Traverse the array:
   - If a zero is encountered, increment the current zero segment count.
   - If a non-zero is encountered, add the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (where `k` is the current zero segment length) to the total subarrays count, then reset the current zero segment length.
3. After exiting the loop, ensure to add the remaining zero segment subarray count to the total.
4. Return the total subarrays count.

## Code

```python
def zero_filled_subarray(nums):
    total_subarrays = 0
    current_zero_count = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        if num == 0:
            current_zero_count += 1
        else:
            total_subarrays += current_zero_count * (current_zero_count + 1) // 2
            current_zero_count = 0
    
    # Add the last segment of zeros if there was one
    if current_zero_count > 0:
        total_subarrays += current_zero_count * (current_zero_count + 1) // 2
    
    return total_subarrays

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 3, 0, 0, 2, 0, 0, 4]
print(zero_filled_subarray(nums))  # Output: 6
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. Each element is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a fixed amount of extra space.

This solution ensures a linear pass through the array, leveraging simple arithmetic to count subarrays efficiently.
