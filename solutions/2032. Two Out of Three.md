Given three integer arrays `nums1`, `nums2`, and `nums3`, return a distinct array containing all the values that are present in at least two out of the three arrays. You may return the result in any order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input arrays contain duplicate values?**
   - Yes, the input arrays can contain duplicate values, but a value should only appear once in the output if it is present in at least two arrays.

2. **Is there a limit on the size of the input arrays?**
   - Although leetcode problems usually do not specify size limits for input arrays, let's assume they are within a reasonable size to fit into memory (usually up to 10^4 elements).

3. **Should the output array be sorted?**
   - The problem does not specify that the output needs to be sorted. Return the result in any order.

### Strategy

1. **Use Sets for Uniqueness**: Convert each of the input arrays into sets to remove duplicates within each individual array.
2. **Count Occurrences Across Arrays**: Use a dictionary to count how many of the given arrays each number appears in.
3. **Filter the Results**: Add numbers that appear in at least two of the three arrays to the result list.
4. **Return the Result**: Convert the resulting set back to a list and return it.

### Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def twoOutOfThree(nums1, nums2, nums3):
    # Convert each list to a set to remove duplicates
    set1, set2, set3 = set(nums1), set(nums2), set(nums3)
    
    # Dictionary to keep track of the appearance count
    appearance_count = defaultdict(int)
    
    # Function to update the count dictionary
    def update_count(num_set):
        for num in num_set:
            appearance_count[num] += 1
            
    update_count(set1)
    update_count(set2)
    update_count(set3)
    
    # Collect numbers that appear in at least two sets
    result = [num for num, count in appearance_count.items() if count > 1]
    
    return result
    
# Example usage:
nums1 = [1, 1, 3, 2]
nums2 = [2, 3]
nums3 = [3]
print(twoOutOfThree(nums1, nums2, nums3))  # Output: [2, 3]
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Set Conversion**: Converting each list of size `n` into a set takes O(n). Since we have three lists, this step takes O(n + m + o) where `n`, `m`, and `o` are lengths of `nums1`, `nums2`, and `nums3` respectively.
2. **Counting Occurrences**: Iterating over each of the sets takes O(n) for each set, so O(n + m + o) in total.
3. **Filtering Results**: This involves a single pass over the dictionary, which contains at most `n + m + o` entries, thus taking O(n + m + o).

Overall, the time complexity is O(n + m + o), which is efficient for this problem.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is mainly from:
- Storing the sets derived from the input arrays, which require O(n + m + o) extra space.
- The dictionary for counting occurrences which has at most O(n + m + o) entries.
- The result list.

So, the space complexity is O(n + m + o).
