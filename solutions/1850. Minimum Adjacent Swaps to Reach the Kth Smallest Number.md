title:  Minimum Adjacent Swaps to Reach the Kth Smallest Number-out
permalink: /s1850
---

Given a string `num` representing a large integer, you need to determine the minimum number of adjacent swaps required to transform the given number into the k-th smallest number obtained by permuting the digits of `num`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size and Constraints**:
   - How long can the string `num` be?
   - What are the constraints on `k`?
   
   *Note*: The constraints usually present in the problem will provide insight into what kind of optimizations are required.

2. **Digit Repetition**:
   - Are there repeated digits in `num`?

3. **Output Requirements**:
   - Should the result be the minimum number of adjacent swaps needed?

### Strategy

The main steps to solve this problem are:
1. **Generate the k-th permutation**: Use a systematic approach to generate the k-th smallest permutation of the given number.
2. **Calculate Minimum Swaps**: Once we have the target permutation, compute the minimum number of adjacent swaps required to convert the original string to the target permutation.

### Code

Here's how we can implement this step by step:

```python
def get_next_permutation(s):
    s = list(s)
    n = len(s)
    
    i = n - 2
    while i >= 0 and s[i] >= s[i + 1]:
        i -= 1
    if i == -1:
        return ''.join(s[::-1])
    
    j = n - 1
    while s[j] <= s[i]:
        j -= 1
    
    s[i], s[j] = s[j], s[i]
    s = s[:i + 1] + s[i + 1:][::-1]
    
    return ''.join(s)

def kth_permutation(num, k):
    for _ in range(k):
        num = get_next_permutation(num)
    return num

def min_adjacent_swaps(num, target):
    num = list(num)
    target = list(target)
    swaps = 0
    
    for i in range(len(num)):
        if num[i] == target[i]:
            continue
        
        j = i
        while num[j] != target[i]:
            j += 1
        
        while j > i:
            num[j], num[j - 1] = num[j - 1], num[j]
            j -= 1
            swaps += 1
            
    return swaps

def min_swaps_to_kth_permutation(num, k):
    target = kth_permutation(num, k)
    return min_adjacent_swaps(num, target)

# Example usage:
num = "5489355142"
k = 4
print(min_swaps_to_kth_permutation(num, k)) # Example output
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Generating k-th Permutation**:
   - The permutation generation step runs for `k` iterations, and each iteration computes the next permutation in O(n) time where `n` is the length of the string.

2. **Calculating Minimum Swaps**:
   - The minimum swaps calculation involves a nested loop where the outer loop runs for `O(n)` and the inner loop (in the worst case) also runs for `O(n)`, hence making it O(n^2).

Combining these, the total time complexity would be approximately:
- If `k` is quite large, controlling the number of permutations to be processed matters.
- **Overall Time Complexity**: O(k * n + n^3) in the worst scenario.

This balanced approach ensures we are correctly obtaining both the k-th permutation and the minimal swaps required.
