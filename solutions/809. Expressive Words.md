Before we dive into the solution, let's clarify the problem statement a bit:

1. **Input Clarification**:
   - You have a string `s`.
   - You have an array of words `words`.

2. **Output Requirement**:
   - You need to return the number of words that are "stretchy" relative to the string `s`.

3. **Definition of Stretchy**:
   - A word is considered stretchy if it can be made to match `s` by expanding some of its characters into a group of repeated characters.
   - This expansion must occur where a character in `s` already forms a group of repeated characters of length 3 or more.
   - For example, "heeellooo" is stretchy relative to "hello" because 'e' can be stretched to "ee" and 'o' can be stretched to "ooo".

### Strategy
1. **Character Grouping**:
   - Group characters together and note their counts for both `s` and each word in `words`. This helps in comparing the structure.

2. **Comparison**:
   - Compare each word's grouped characters with that of `s`.
   - Ensure that the words have the same character structure and follow the stipulation where characters in `s` can extend to at least 3 for "stretchiness" but not vice versa.

### Steps
1. Write a function to group characters and their counts.
2. Compare the character groups of `s` with each word to determine "stretchiness".
3. Count how many words are stretchy.

### Code

```python
def expressive_words(s: str, words: list) -> int:
    def get_char_groups(word):
        groups = []
        i, n = 0, len(word)
        while i < n:
            char = word[i]
            count = 0
            while i < n and word[i] == char:
                i += 1
                count += 1
            groups.append((char, count))
        return groups
    
    def is_stretchy(s_group, w_group):
        if len(s_group) != len(w_group):
            return False

        for (sc, sc_count), (wc, wc_count) in zip(s_group, w_group):
            if sc != wc:
                return False
            if sc_count < wc_count:
                return False
            if sc_count > wc_count and sc_count < 3:
                return False
        
        return True

    s_group = get_char_groups(s)
    count_stretchy_words = 0

    for word in words:
        w_group = get_char_groups(word)
        if is_stretchy(s_group, w_group):
            count_stretchy_words += 1

    return count_stretchy_words

# Example Usage
s = "heeellooo"
words = ["hello", "hi", "helo"]
print(expressive_words(s, words))  # Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity
- The `get_char_groups` function runs in O(n) where n is the length of the word involved, since it involves a single scan of the word.
- `is_stretchy` runs in O(k) where k is the number of groups in the word.
- The overall time complexity for `expressive_words` is O(n * m) where n is the length of `s` and m is the average length of words in the list since each word in `words` is processed individually.

This solution should efficiently determine the number of stretchy words relative to the string `s`.
