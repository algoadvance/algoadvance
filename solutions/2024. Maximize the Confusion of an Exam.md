title:  Maximize the Confusion of an Exam-out

You have a binary string `answerKey` of length `n` where `answerKey[i]` is either `'T'` (true) or `'F'` (false). In one operation, you can choose any index and flip the value of the answer key at that index (i.e., change 'T' to 'F' or 'F' to 'T').

Given an integer `k`, return the maximum number of consecutive 'T's or 'F's in the answer key that you can have after performing the operation at most `k` times.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `k` be larger than the length of the string `n`?**
   - No, `k` will be between 0 and `n`.

2. **Is the input string always a valid binary string (only 'T' and 'F')?**
   - Yes, the input string will only contain 'T' and 'F'.

3. **What do we return if both 'T' and 'F' can be maximized to the same length?**
   - Return the length, as we are only concerned with the maximum length.

## Strategy

1. **Sliding Window Approach**: The problem can be approached using the sliding window (or two-pointer) technique. We will use two pointers to maintain a window where the number of flips does not exceed `k`. We will then expand and contract this window to find the maximum length of consecutive characters ('T' or 'F').
   
2. **Two Scenarios**: We need to consider two scenarios: 
   - Maximize the sequence of 'T's by allowing at most `k` 'F's to be flipped.
   - Maximize the sequence of 'F's by allowing at most `k` 'T's to be flipped.
   
3. **Calculate Result**: We then find the maximum of these two scenarios' results to get the desired output.

## Code

```python
def maxConsecutiveAnswers(answerKey: str, k: int) -> int:
    def maxConsecutiveChar(ch: str) -> int:
        left, max_len, max_count = 0, 0, 0
        
        for right in range(len(answerKey)):
            if answerKey[right] == ch:
                max_count += 1
            
            while (right - left + 1) - max_count > k:
                if answerKey[left] == ch:
                    max_count -= 1
                left += 1
            
            max_len = max(max_len, right - left + 1)
        
        return max_len
    
    return max(maxConsecutiveChar('T'), maxConsecutiveChar('F'))

# Example usage
print(maxConsecutiveAnswers("TTFF", 2))  # Output: 4
print(maxConsecutiveAnswers("TFFT", 1))  # Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `answerKey`. This is because both the inner and outer loops combined traverse each character of the string at most twice.

**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(1)** since we are using a fixed amount of extra space irrespective of the input size.
