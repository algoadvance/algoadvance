title:  Construct the Lexicographically Largest Valid Sequence-out
permalink: /s1718
---
Given an integer `n`, find a sequence that satisfies all the following conditions:
1. The sequence has a length of `2n - 1`.
2. Each integer from 1 to `n` appears exactly twice in the sequence.
3. The distance between the two occurrences of the integer `i` is exactly `i` (formal definition: for every `i` from 1 to `n`, there exist indices `j` and `k` where `sequence[j] == sequence[k] == i` and `|j - k| == i`).

Your goal is to return the lexicographically largest such sequence.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints on `n`:** What is the maximum value of `n`?
   - This can help understand the limits related to time complexity.
2. **Uniqueness of the solution:** Is there always a unique lexicographically largest sequence for each valid `n`?
3. **Output Format:** Should the sequence be returned as a list, or string, or any other format?

Assuming `1 <= n <= 20` as per constraints typical of similar problems.

### Strategy
1. **Backtracking Approach:** Since the problem aims to find the lexicographically largest sequence, a backtracking approach will be effective, trying the largest number available at each step.
2. **Placement Condition:** For each number, try to place it at the current available position and then check if the sequence can still be completed by making recursive calls.
3. **Pruning:** If at any time placing a number does not lead to a valid sequence, backtrack immediately.
4. **Maintenance of State:** Use a list to maintain the sequence and a set to keep track of used numbers.

### Code Implementation

```python
def constructDistancedSequence(n):
    def backtrack(sequence, positions):
        if len(positions) == 0:
            return True
        for i in range(n, 0, -1):
            if i in positions:
                continue
            
            # Find a position for the first appearance of i
            for j in range(len(sequence) - i - 1):
                if sequence[j] == 0 and sequence[j + i + 1] == 0:
                    # Place 'i' at j and j + i + 1
                    sequence[j] = i
                    sequence[j + i + 1] = i
                    positions.add(i)
                    
                    if backtrack(sequence, positions):
                        return True
                    
                    # Backtrack
                    sequence[j] = 0
                    sequence[j + i + 1] = 0
                    positions.remove(i)

        return False

    # Initialize sequence with zeros
    sequence = [0] * (2 * n - 1)
    backtrack(sequence, set())
    return sequence

# Example usage
n = 3
print(constructDistancedSequence(n))  # Output: the lexicographically largest valid sequence for given n
```

### Time Complexity
- **Worst Case:** The algorithm explores potential placements through a backtracking approach. Given that the size of the sequence is `2n - 1`, the placements can be combinatorial in nature.
- The worst-case time complexity can be approximated to `O((2n-1)!)` in the extreme case but typically performs much faster due to the pruning of invalid branches early.

This solution is designed to handle the constraints efficiently and ensure the lexicographically largest sequence is found.
