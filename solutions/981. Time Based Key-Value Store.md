title:  Time Based Key-Value Store-out

Design a time-based key-value data structure that can store multiple values for the same key at different time stamps and retrieve the key's value at a certain timestamp.

Implement the `TimeMap` class:

- `TimeMap()`: Initializes the object of the data structure.
- `void set(String key, String value, int timestamp)`: Stores the key `key` with the value `value` at the given time `timestamp`.
- `String get(String key, int timestamp)`: Returns a value such that `set` was called previously, with `timestamp_prev <= timestamp`. If there are multiple such values, it returns the value associated with the largest `timestamp_prev`. If there are no values, it returns an empty string `""`.

**Example:**

```python
Input:
["TimeMap", "set", "get", "get", "set", "get", "get"]
[[], ["foo", "bar", 1], ["foo", 1], ["foo", 3], ["foo", "bar2", 4], ["foo", 4], ["foo", 5]]

Output:
[null, null, "bar", "bar", null, "bar2", "bar2"]
```

## Clarifying Questions

Before starting with the solution, let's clarify a few points:

1. **Timestamp Ordering:** Can we assume that the timestamps provided in the `set` method calls will be in non-decreasing order? 
   - No, the timestamps can be in any order.

2. **Duplicate Key & Timestamp:** Can there be multiple `set` calls with the same `key` and `timestamp`?
   - It's assumed that there would be no duplicate key and timestamp pairs.

3. **Timestamp Range:** What is the range of the timestamps?
   - The timestamp is a positive integer.

4. **Return Type of `get`:** Is it always guaranteed that the `get` method will provide a timestamp such that it has at least one value stored?
   - No, it should return an empty string if no such value exists.

## Strategy

1. **Data Storage:** Use a dictionary to store the key, where the value is a list of tuples. Each tuple consists of `(timestamp, value)`.

2. **Set Method:** Simply append the `(timestamp, value)` pair to the list corresponding to the key. Ensure the list remains sorted by timestamps.

3. **Get Method:**
   - If the key doesn't exist, return an empty string.
   - If the key exists, use binary search to find the largest timestamp less than or equal to the given timestamp to return the respective value.

## Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict
import bisect

class TimeMap:
    
    def __init__(self):
        self.store = defaultdict(list)

    def set(self, key: str, value: str, timestamp: int) -> None:
        self.store[key].append((timestamp, value))

    def get(self, key: str, timestamp: int) -> str:
        if key not in self.store:
            return ""
        
        values = self.store[key]
        idx = bisect.bisect_right(values, (timestamp, chr(127)))
        
        if idx == 0:
            return ""
        
        return values[idx - 1][1]

# Example use case
# kv = TimeMap()
# kv.set("foo", "bar", 1)
# print(kv.get("foo", 1))  # Output: "bar"
# print(kv.get("foo", 3))  # Output: "bar"
# kv.set("foo", "bar2", 4)
# print(kv.get("foo", 4))  # Output: "bar2"
# print(kv.get("foo", 5))  # Output: "bar2"
```

## Time Complexity

- `set` Operation:
  - Appending a value to the list: \( O(1) \)
  
- `get` Operation:
  - Binary search to find the appropriate value: \( O(\log N) \), where \( N \) is the number of timestamps for the key.

Overall, the data structure efficiently supports the required operations with optimal time complexity.
