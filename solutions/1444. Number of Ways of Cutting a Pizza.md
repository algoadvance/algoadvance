title:  Number of Ways of Cutting a Pizza-out
permalink: /s1444
---

You are given a rectangular pizza represented as a `rows x cols` matrix containing a set of `A (apple)` and `.` (empty cell). You need to cut the pizza into `k` pieces using `k-1` cuts. For each cut, you choose one axis (horizontal or vertical) and a position to make the cut. Each of the remaining pieces must contain at least one apple. Return the number of ways to cut the pizza such that all resulting pieces contain at least one apple. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format**: 
   - `pizza`: List of strings, where each string is a row of the pizza matrix.
   - `k`: An integer representing the number of pieces to cut the pizza into.

2. **Constraints**:
   - `1 <= rows, cols <= 50`
   - `1 <= k <= 10`
   - The pizza contains between `1` and `2500` characters.

3. **Output**:
   - The number of ways to cut the pizza modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming combined with prefix sums to determine the number of apples in sub-sections of the pizza efficiently. The general idea is as follows:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table**: 
   - Use a memoization table `dp[i][j][k]` where `dp[i][j][k]` represents the number of ways to cut the sub-pizza starting at cell `(i, j)` into `k` pieces.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - Calculate the number of apples in any rectangular sub-pizza efficiently using a 2D prefix sum array `prefix` where `prefix[i][j]` is the number of apples in the sub-pizza from the bottom-right corner to cell `(i, j)`.

3. **Recursive DP with Memoization**:
   - Use recursion with memoization to fill in the `dp` table leveraging both horizontal and vertical cuts. Check the number of apples in each resulting piece after a cut to ensure validity.

4. **Base Case**:
   - If `k == 1`, check if there is at least one apple in the remaining sub-pizza. If so, there's exactly one way to achieve this cut.

### Time Complexity

- Building the prefix sum array takes `O(rows * cols)`.
- The recursive function has at most `rows * cols * k` states and each state explores `O(rows + cols)` possible cuts.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(rows * cols * k * (rows + cols))`.

### Code

Here's the Python solution to the problem:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def numOfWays(pizza, k):
    rows, cols = len(pizza), len(pizza[0])
    
    # Prefix sum array to count apples
    prefix = [[0] * (cols + 1) for _ in range(rows + 1)]
    
    for i in range(rows - 1, -1, -1):
        for j in range(cols - 1, -1, -1):
            prefix[i][j] = (1 if pizza[i][j] == 'A' else 0) + prefix[i + 1][j] + prefix[i][j + 1] - prefix[i + 1][j + 1]

    # Memoization for DP
    dp = [[[-1] * k for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]
    
    def has_apples(x1, y1, x2, y2):
        return prefix[x1][y1] - prefix[x2][y1] - prefix[x1][y2] + prefix[x2][y2] > 0
    
    def find_ways(i, j, k):
        if k == 1:
            return 1 if has_apples(i, j, rows, cols) else 0
        
        if dp[i][j][k - 1] != -1:
            return dp[i][j][k - 1]
        
        ans = 0
        for x in range(i + 1, rows):
            if has_apples(i, j, x, cols):
                ans = (ans + find_ways(x, j, k - 1)) % MOD
        for y in range(j + 1, cols):
            if has_apples(i, j, rows, y):
                ans = (ans + find_ways(i, y, k - 1)) % MOD
        
        dp[i][j][k - 1] = ans
        return ans
    
    return find_ways(0, 0, k)

# Example use:
# pizza = ["A..", "AAA", "..."]
# k = 3
# print(numOfWays(pizza, k)) # Output: Number of ways to cut the pizza into 3 pieces
```

This solution correctly establishes the prefix sum, uses top-down dynamic programming with memoization, and ensures that all resulting pieces contain at least one apple.
