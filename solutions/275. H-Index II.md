Given an array of integers `citations` where `citations[i]` is the number of citations a researcher received for their `i-th` paper, and `citations` is sorted in an ascending order, return the researcher's h-index.

The h-index is defined as the maximum value `h` such that the researcher has published `h` papers that have each been cited at least `h` times.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is it guaranteed that the array `citations` is sorted in ascending order?**
   - Yes, the problem statement guarantees that the array is sorted in ascending order.

2. **What should be returned if the input array is empty?**
   - Return 0, as no papers imply an h-index of 0.

3. **What is the maximum size of the input array?**
   - The problem does not specify, but for the purpose of this problem, letâ€™s assume the array size can be large, potentially up to \(10^6\).

### Strategy

Given that the array is sorted, a binary search approach would work efficiently. The typical strategy for finding the h-index in a sorted array is:

1. Initialize two pointers: `left` at the start (0) and `right` at the end (`len(citations) - 1`) of the array.
2. Use binary search to find the maximum h-index:
   - Calculate `mid` as the average of `left` and `right`.
   - Determine the number of papers with citations `>= citations[mid]` by `n - mid` (where `n` is the total number of papers).
   - Check if `citations[mid]` is a valid h-index by comparing it to `n - mid`.
   - Adjust the binary search range accordingly until `left` exceeds `right`.

3. Return the point where the h-index condition was last met.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the binary search approach is \(O(\log n)\), where `n` is the number of papers.

### Code

```python
def hIndex(citations):
    n = len(citations)
    left, right = 0, n - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if citations[mid] == n - mid:
            return citations[mid]
        elif citations[mid] < n - mid:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return n - left

# Example usage:
citations = [0, 1, 3, 5, 6]
print(hIndex(citations))  # Output: 3
```

In this code, the binary search helps efficiently find the h-index by narrowing down the potential values based on the sorted order of the citations array.
