title:  Smallest Subarrays With Maximum Bitwise OR-out
permalink: /s2411
---

You are given a binary matrix `M` of size `m x n`, where each cell contains either a `0` or a `1`. You need to find the smallest submatrix that contains the maximum bitwise OR of all its elements. The function should return an array where each element corresponds to the smallest subarray for each starting index in the input list.

#### Example:
```plaintext
Input: 
matrix = [[1,0,0,1,1],
          [0,1,1,0,0],
          [1,0,0,1,0]],
target = [2,1,3]
Output: [3,2,3]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be the input/output format?**
   - The input will be a binary matrix and a list of starting indexes.
   - The output will be a list with the smallest sizes of subarrays starting at each index.

2. **What does the bitwise OR of rows mean?**
   - Given starting and ending indexes, calculating the bitwise OR for all elements in between and including these indexes.

3. **Can elements in the matrix be both 0 and 1?**
   - Yes, the matrix will contain only binary values.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize the matrix and target list.

2. **Bitwise OR Calculation:**
   - A helper function to determine the bitwise OR of a subset of rows from a starting index through a given boundary.
  
3. **Two-Pointer Technique:**
   - Use two pointers to find the minimum subarray size for each start index.

4. **Iterate Over Starting Points:**
   - For each starting index, use a nested loop to find the minimal subarray size achieving the maximum OR.

### Code Implementation

Here's a function implementing this approach:

```python
def smallest_subarrays(matrix, target):
    def bitwise_or(arr):
        result = 0
        for num in arr:
            result |= num
        return result

    rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    max_len = [0] * rows

    for r in range(rows):
        if target[r] in matrix[r]:
            max_len[r] = 1
        else:
            bit_or = 0
            for c in range(cols):
                bit_or |= matrix[r][c]
                if bit_or >= target[r]:
                    max_len[r] = c + 1                   
                    break
            if not max_len[r]:
                max_len[r] = cols  

    return max_len

# Example usage:
matrix = [
    [1, 0, 0, 1, 1],
    [0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 0, 1, 0]
]
target = [2, 1, 3]
print(smallest_subarrays(matrix, target))
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization:** Calculate number of rows and columns (`rows, cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])`).
2. **Bitwise OR Function:** `bitwise_or` function performs the bitwise OR for a given array.
3. **Target Loop:** For each index in the target list:
   - If the target is directly in the row, mark length as 1 because OR with itself is required.
   - For each column starting from the leftmost, progressively calculate the bitwise OR and check if it reaches or exceeds the target.
4. **Mandatory Return:** If no sufficient OR sum, assign the total length of the columns.
5. **Return:** The resultant list is returned.

### Time Complexity

1. **Initialization:** `O(1)`
2. **Bitwise OR Calculation:** `O(C)` for each row subset operation.
3. **Outer Loop:** `O(R * C)` for iterating over rows and columns.

- **Overall Complexity:** `O(R * C)` where `R` is the number of rows and `C` is the number of columns in the matrix.

This solution efficiently computes the subarray sizes to meet the constraints given by the target list.
