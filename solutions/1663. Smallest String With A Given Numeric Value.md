title:  Smallest String With A Given Numeric Value-out
permalink: /s1663
---
You are given two integers `n` and `k`. Return the lexicographically smallest string with length equal to `n` and numeric value equal to `k`.

The numeric value of a string consisting of lowercase English letters is defined as the sum of the positions of its characters in the alphabet starting from 1 (i.e., the position of 'a' is 1, the position of 'b' is 2, and so on, up to the position of 'z' being 26).

### Example
- Example 1:
    - Input: `n = 3`, `k = 27`
    - Output: `"aay"`
    - Explanation: The numeric value of the string is 1 + 1 + 25 = 27, and it is the smallest string possible.
  
- Example 2:
    - Input: `n = 5`, `k = 73`
    - Output: `"aaszz"`

### Clarifying Questions
1. Does the string need to contain only lowercase English letters?
   - Yes, the problem statement specifies only lowercase English letters.
2. What's the smallest and largest possible value for `n` and `k`?
   - Typically, constraints are provided within the problem prompt. For this example, we can assume reasonable constraints, but the strategy should generally work within typical bounds for Leetcode problems.

### Strategy
To find the lexicographically smallest string with a given length `n` and numeric value `k`, we can follow this approach:

1. Initialize an array with `n` characters, all set to 'a'. This gives us a string with a minimal numeric value of `n` (since 'a' contributes a value of 1).
2. Calculate the remaining value needed to reach the target `k`, which is initially `k - n` because we started with all 'a's.
3. Starting from the end of the string, increment characters to increase the total value. Replace 'a' with higher characters until the remaining value is exhausted.

### Code
Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
def getSmallestString(n: int, k: int) -> str:
    # Initialize the result array with 'a' which has a value of 1
    result = ['a'] * n
    
    # Calculate the initial value of the string
    current_value = n
    
    # Start from the end of the string
    index = n - 1
    
    # Modify the string until the total value is equal to k
    while current_value < k:
        # Calculate maximum value we can add at this position, maximum is 25 ('z' - 'a')
        add_value = min(25, k - current_value)
        
        # Update the character at the current index
        result[index] = chr(ord('a') + add_value)
        
        # Update the current total value
        current_value += add_value
        
        # Move to the previous position in the array
        index -= 1
    
    return ''.join(result)

# Example usage:
print(getSmallestString(3, 27))  # Output: "aay"
print(getSmallestString(5, 73))  # Output: "aaszz"
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) 
  - We traverse the string from end to start which is O(n).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - We use a list of size `n` to store the result.

This solution efficiently constructs the lexicographically smallest string with the given numeric value and length, leveraging the minimal initial value approach combined with incremental adjustments.
