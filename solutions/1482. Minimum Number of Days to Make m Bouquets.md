title:  Minimum Number of Days to Make m Bouquets-out
permalink: /s1482
---

You are given an integer array `bloomDay`, an integer `m` and an integer `k`.

You want to make `m` bouquets. To make a bouquet, you need to use `k` adjacent flowers from the garden.

The garden consists of `n` flowers, the `ith` flower will bloom in the `bloomDay[i]` and then can be used in exactly one bouquet.

Return the minimum number of days you need to wait to be able to make `m` bouquets from the garden. If it is impossible to make m bouquets return -1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the size of the array `bloomDay` and the values of `m` and `k`?**
   - Typical constraints for such problems. Usually `1 <= bloomDay.length <= 10^5` and `1 <= bloomDay[i] <= 10^9`, `1 <= m, k <= bloomDay.length`.

2. **Can the values in `bloomDay` be repeated?**
   - Yes, multiple flowers can bloom on the same day.

3. **What should be returned if it's impossible to create `m` bouquets?**
   - The function should return -1.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use Binary Search on the number of days. The reasoning behind using binary search is:
- If you can make `m` bouquets on day `x`, you can certainly make them on any day after `x`.
- Conversely, if you cannot make `m` bouquets on day `x`, you cannot make them on any earlier day either.

#### Steps:

1. **Determine the Search Space:**
   - The minimum possible day can be the minimum value in `bloomDay` because we need at least the first flower to bloom.
   - The maximum possible day can be the maximum value in `bloomDay` because if all flowers are blooming at the latest day, we need this day.

2. **Check Feasibility Function:**
   - Create a utility function to check if we can make `m` bouquets by day `x`.

3. **Apply Binary Search:**
   - Use binary search to find the minimum day for which the feasibility function returns true.

### Code

```python
def minDays(bloomDay, m, k):
    def canMakeBouquets(mid):
        bouquets = 0
        flowers = 0
        
        for bloom in bloomDay:
            if bloom <= mid:
                flowers += 1
                if flowers == k:
                    bouquets += 1
                    flowers = 0
            else:
                flowers = 0
                
            if bouquets >= m:
                return True
        
        return False
    
    if m * k > len(bloomDay):
        return -1
    
    left, right = min(bloomDay), max(bloomDay)
    
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if canMakeBouquets(mid):
            right = mid
        else:
            left = mid + 1
    
    return left

# Example usage:
bloomDay = [1, 10, 3, 10, 2]
m = 3
k = 1
print(minDays(bloomDay, m, k))  # Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search Complexity:** The binary search will run in `O(log N)` time where `N` is the range of possible days.
- **Feasibility Function Complexity:** For each mid value, we iterate through the bloomDay array which takes `O(n)` time.

Combining both, the overall time complexity is `O(n log D)`, where `n` is the length of `bloomDay` and `D` is the range between the maximum and minimum values in `bloomDay`.
