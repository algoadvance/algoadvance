title:  Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array-out
permalink: /s34
---
You are given an array of integers `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, and an integer `target`. Your task is to find the starting and ending position of a given `target` value in the array.

Return an array of length 2, where the first element is the starting position and the second element is the ending position of `target`. If `target` is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the array contain duplicate elements?
   - **A:** Yes, the array can contain duplicates.
   
2. **Q:** What should be returned if the target is not found in the array?
   - **A:** Return `[-1, -1]`.
   
3. **Q:** Should I handle any special cases, like an empty array?
   - **A:** Yes, if the array is empty, return `[-1, -1]`.

### Strategy
To achieve the required `O(log n)` time complexity, we can use a binary search approach. Hereâ€™s the plan:

1. **Find the First Position of `target`:**
    - Use binary search to locate the first occurrence of `target`. 
    - Initialize `left` to 0 and `right` to the length of the array minus one.
    - Narrow down the search space by comparing the midpoint value to the target. If the midpoint value is greater than or equal to `target`, eliminate the right half; otherwise, eliminate the left half.
    - When a match is found, continue searching in the left half to find the leftmost occurrence.

2. **Find the Last Position of `target`:**
    - Use a similar binary search approach to locate the last occurrence of `target`.
    - Again, initialize `left` to 0 and `right` to the length of the array minus one.
    - Narrow down the search space using the same comparison logic. If the midpoint value is less than or equal to `target`, eliminate the left half; otherwise, eliminate the right half.
    - When a match is found, continue searching in the right half to find the rightmost occurrence.

3. **Combine Results:**
    - Return the indices found from the two binary searches. If the target is not present, both searches will return `-1`.

### Code
```python
def searchRange(nums, target):
    def findFirst(nums, target):
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        first_pos = -1
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if nums[mid] == target:
                first_pos = mid
                right = mid - 1
            elif nums[mid] < target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        return first_pos

    def findLast(nums, target):
        left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
        last_pos = -1
        while left <= right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if nums[mid] == target:
                last_pos = mid
                left = mid + 1
            elif nums[mid] < target:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        return last_pos

    first_pos = findFirst(nums, target)
    last_pos = findLast(nums, target)

    return [first_pos, last_pos]

# Example Usage
nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10]
target = 8
print(searchRange(nums, target))  # Output: [3, 4]
```

### Time Complexity
- Finding the first position takes `O(log n)` because it uses a binary search.
- Finding the last position also takes `O(log n)` for the same reason.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(log n)`.
