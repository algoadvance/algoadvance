title:  Reduction Operations to Make the Array Elements Equal-out
permalink: /s1887
---

Given an array of integers `nums`, your goal is to make all the elements of the array equal by performing the following operation any number of times: 
- **Operation**: Choose any `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` (0 ≤ i, j < nums.length) and `nums[i] < nums[j]`, then `nums[j] = nums[i]`.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make all the elements of the array equal.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Are all the elements in `nums` positive integers?
   **A**: The problem statement doesn't specify. Let's assume they can be any integers.

2. **Q**: Can `nums` be empty or contain only one element?
   **A**: The problem statement doesn't handle this directly. If `nums` is empty or has one element, no operations are needed.

3. **Q**: Is there any constraint on the length of the array?
   **A**: According to the problem description on LeetCode, the length can be as large as 10⁵.

4. **Q**: Can `nums` have negative and zero values?
   **A**: Yes, since the problem does not mention any restrictions on the values of the elements.

### Strategy

1. **Sorting**: First, we sort the array.
2. **Operations Counting**: Iterate through the sorted array and count the minimum operations required.
   - Since we want to make all elements equal, the smallest element will be the target.
   - For every larger element, count how many distinct values have been changed to reach this larger element.
   
### Approach

1. Sort the array.
2. Iterate through the sorted array while maintaining a counter for operations.
3. Each time a new distinct element is encountered, increment the count of previously smaller distinct elements and add this count to the total operations.

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the array will cost \(O(N \log N)\).
- Iterating through the array will cost \(O(N)\).
- Combined, the time complexity is \(O(N \log N)\).

### Code Implementation

```python
def reductionOperations(nums):
    nums.sort()
    total_operations = 0
    previous_counts = 0
    
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        if nums[i] != nums[i - 1]:
            previous_counts += 1
        total_operations += previous_counts
    
    return total_operations

# Example Usage
nums = [5, 1, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3]
print(reductionOperations(nums))  # Output: 8
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Sorting**: First, the array `nums` is sorted.
2. **Initializing Counters**: Two counters are initialized, `total_operations` to keep track of the total operations and `previous_counts` to track the count of previous distinct elements.
3. **Iteration and Counting**: The array is iterated starting from the second element.
   - If the current element is different from the previous element, `previous_counts` is incremented.
   - The current value of `previous_counts` is added to `total_operations`.
4. **Return**: Finally, the total number of operations is returned.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count the minimum operations required to make all elements in the array equal.
