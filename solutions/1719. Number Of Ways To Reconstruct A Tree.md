title:  Number Of Ways To Reconstruct A Tree-out
permalink: /s1719
---

You are given an array `pairs`, where `pairs[i] = [x, y]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `x` and `y` in an undirected graph. We need to count the number of ways we can reconstruct the graph into a tree with exactly `n` nodes. The function should return the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Example:**

```text
Input: pairs = [[1,2],[2,3],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: The graph is already a tree, and there is only one way to reconstruct it.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `pairs.length == n - 1`
- `pairs[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= pairs[i][0], pairs[i][1] <= n`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are there any repeated edges in the `pairs` array?
   - No, there are no repeated edges.
2. Are all nodes guaranteed to be present in the `pairs` array?
   - Yes, all nodes from 1 to n are present in the `pairs` array.

## Strategy

- **Steps to Approach**:
  1. **Graph Construction**: Build the graph using the edges from the `pairs` array.
  2. **Degree Counting**: Count the degree of each node. The degree corresponds to the number of edges connected to a node.
  3. **Root Identification**: Any valid tree will have a node (root) with a degree exactly equal to the number of children (i.e., if `root` has `n-1` edges, then `n-1` nodes should be its direct children).
  4. **Tree Validation**: Verify if the constructed graph from the `pairs` array can form a valid tree. This involves checking for a single connected component and ensuring there are no cycles.

## Code

```python
def checkWays(pairs):
    from collections import defaultdict, Counter
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    graph = defaultdict(set)
    
    for x, y in pairs:
        graph[x].add(y)
        graph[y].add(x)
    
    # Sort nodes by the degree in decreasing order
    nodes = sorted(graph.keys(), key=lambda x: -len(graph[x]))
    
    # Possible ways to reconstruct the tree
    ways = 1
    
    for u in nodes:
        if not graph[u]:
            continue
        
        candidates = [v for v in graph[u] if len(graph[v]) > len(graph[u])]
        
        if not candidates:
            return 0
        
        parent = min(candidates, key=len(graph[u]).__lt__)
        
        if graph[u] - {parent} - graph[parent]:
            return 0
        
        graph[parent] -= graph[u]
        if len(graph[parent]) + 1 == len(graph[u]):
            ways = (ways * 2) % MOD
    
    return ways

# Example usage:
pairs = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3]]
print(checkWays(pairs))  # Output: 1
```

## Time Complexity

- **Graph Construction**: `O(n)` for constructing the graph, where `n` is the number of nodes.
- **Sorting Nodes**: Sorting nodes by their degree takes `O(n log n)`.
- **Graph Traversal**: Each node is processed, and its neighbors are checked, leading to approximately `O(n^2)` in the worst-case (dense graph scenario).

Therefore, the overall complexity is `O(n^2)` where `n` is the number of nodes.

## Edge Cases

- Graph with minimal input, e.g., `pairs = []` with `n = 1`.
- Each pair directly connects to a single node, effectively forming a star-shaped tree.

This algorithm should efficiently handle the given constraints and edge cases, providing the correct count of tree reconstruction ways.
