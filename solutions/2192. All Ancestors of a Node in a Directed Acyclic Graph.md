title:  All Ancestors of a Node in a Directed Acyclic Graph-out
permalink: /s2192
---

You are given a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. You are also given a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [fromi, toi]` indicates that there is a directed edge from node `fromi` to node `toi`.

Return a list of lists `ans`, where `ans[i]` is a list of all the ancestors of the `ith` node, sorted in ascending order.

A node `u` is an ancestor of `v` if there exists a directed path from `u` to `v`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - Typically, constraints indicate that `n` can be quite large, but for our purposes, we'll assume reasonable computational limits.
   
2. **Are there any duplicate edges or self-loops?**
   - Since it is a DAG, we should not have any self-loops or duplicate edges as these might violate the DAG property.

3. **Is the input graph guaranteed to be connected?**
   - No, it might not be fully connected.

### Strategy

1. **Represent the Graph:**
   - Create an adjacency list to represent the graph.

2. **Transpose of the Graph:**
   - Create a reversed adjacency list where edges point to their sources, aiding in a reverse traversal to find ancestors.

3. **Depth-First Search (DFS):**
   - Perform a DFS for each node to collect all reachable nodes (ancestors) using the reversed graph.

4. **Sorting:**
   - After collecting the ancestors, sort them in ascending order.

### Code

```python
def getAncestors(n, edges):
    from collections import defaultdict, deque

    # Build graph and its reverse
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    reversed_graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
        reversed_graph[v].append(u)

    def dfs(node, visited):
        if node in memo:
            return memo[node]
        ancestors = set()
        for neighbor in reversed_graph[node]:
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                ancestors.add(neighbor)
                ancestors.update(dfs(neighbor, visited))
        visited.remove(node)
        memo[node] = ancestors
        return ancestors

    memo = {}
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]

    # Collect all ancestors for each node
    for node in range(n):
        ancestors = list(dfs(node, set()))
        ancestors.sort()
        result[node] = ancestors

    return result

# Example use-case:
n = 8
edges = [[0,3],[0,4],[1,3],[2,4],[2,7],[3,5],[3,6],[3,7],[4,6]]
print(getAncestors(n, edges))
```

### Time Complexity

- **Graph Construction:** \(O(E)\), where \(E\) is the number of edges in the graph.
- **DFS Traversal:** \(O(N + E)\), for each node considering all its neighbors.
- **Sorting Ancestors:** \(O(N \cdot A \log A)\), where \(A\) is the average number of ancestors per node.

### Space Complexity

- \(O(N + E)\) for storing the graph.
- \(O(N)\) for the recursive call stack in worst case.
- \(O(N \cdot A)\) for storing the ancestors list.

This solution ensures that we efficiently find and sort ancestors for each node in a DAG.
