title:  Find in Mountain Array-out
permalink: /s1095

(This problem is an interactive problem.)

You may recall that an array `arr` is a *mountain array* if and only if:

- `arr.length >= 3`
- There exists some `i` with `0 < i < arr.length - 1` such that:
  - `arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]`
  - `arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]`

Given a mountain array `mountainArr`, return the minimum index such that `mountainArr.get(index) == target`. If such an index does not exist, return `-1`.

You can't directly access the array. You are allowed to call `MountainArray.get(k)` for obtaining the element of the array at index `k`.

Submissions making more than `100` calls to `MountainArray.get` will be judged as `Wrong Answer`. Also, any solution that attempts to circumvent the judge will result in disqualification.

You are given the interface `MountainArray` which has the following methods:
- `MountainArray.get(index: int) -> int`: Allows you to get an element at the given index.
- `MountainArray.length() -> int`: Returns the length of the array.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What range of values can the elements in the mountain array take?
   - This will help in understanding the constraints for elements.
2. Is it guaranteed that elements in the array are unique?
   - This helps in optimizing the search strategy.

## Code

```python
class Solution:
    def findInMountainArray(self, target: int, mountain_arr: 'MountainArray') -> int:
        def find_peak(mountain_arr):
            left, right = 0, mountain_arr.length() - 1
            while left < right:
                mid = (left + right) // 2
                if mountain_arr.get(mid) < mountain_arr.get(mid + 1):
                    left = mid + 1
                else:
                    right = mid
            return left
        
        def binary_search(mountain_arr, target, left, right, ascending=True):
            while left <= right:
                mid = (left + right) // 2
                mid_value = mountain_arr.get(mid)
                if mid_value == target:
                    return mid
                if ascending:
                    if mid_value < target:
                        left = mid + 1
                    else:
                        right = mid - 1
                else:
                    if mid_value > target:
                        left = mid + 1
                    else:
                        right = mid - 1
            return -1
        
        peak = find_peak(mountain_arr)
        
        # Try to find target on the ascending part
        index = binary_search(mountain_arr, target, 0, peak, True)
        if index != -1:
            return index
        
        # Try to find target on the descending part
        return binary_search(mountain_arr, target, peak + 1, mountain_arr.length() - 1, False)
```

## Strategy

1. **Finding the Peak:**
   - Use a modified binary search to find the peak of the mountain array. The peak is the point where the elements switch from increasing to decreasing.
   - If `arr[mid] < arr[mid + 1]`, then the peak is to the right, otherwise the peak is to the left.

2. **Binary Search on Ascending Part:**
   - Perform a binary search on the subarray from the start to the peak index.
   - During this search, if the target is found, return the index.

3. **Binary Search on Descending Part:**
   - Perform a binary search on the subarray from the peak index to the end, but consider that this part is sorted in descending order.
   - Adjust the conditions accordingly for the descending part.

## Time Complexity

- Finding the peak involves a binary search, which takes `O(log n)` time.
- The binary search on both parts can each take `O(log n)` time.
  
Overall, the algorithm runs in `O(log n)` time complexity.
