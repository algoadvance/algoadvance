title:  Restore The Array-out
permalink: /s1416
---
You are given a string `s` that contains only digits and an integer `k`. We need to find out the number of possible arrays that can be formed following these conditions:

1. Each number in the array must be at least 1 and at most `k`.
2. The length of each number is at least one, meaning no number starts with a '0' except for the single digit '0'.
3. The array should be concatenated to form the given string `s` exactly.

Because the answer may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Example:
- Input: `s = "1000", k = 10000`
- Output: `1`

- Input: `s = "1000", k = 10`
- Output: `0`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Is `s` always a valid string only containing digits 0-9?**
   - Yes.
2. **What are the length constraints for `s` and `k`?**
   - The length of `s` is between `1` and `10^5`.
   - `1 <= k <= 10^9`.

## Strategy
We'll use dynamic programming to solve this problem. The approach is to use a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to restore the array from the substring `s[i:]`.

Here's the detailed plan:
1. Initialize an array `dp` of length `len(s) + 1` with all zeros. The last element `dp[len(s)]` is `1` because there is one way to restore the array from an empty string.
2. Iterate backward through the string `s` from the last character to the first character.
3. For each position `i`, attempt to form all possible valid numbers `num` that start at `i` and are between `1` and `k`.
4. Update `dp[i]` by adding `dp[j]`, where `j` is the index immediately after the end of the valid number `num`.
5. Return `dp[0]` as it will contain the number of ways to restore the entire array.

## Code
Let's move on to the implementation:

```python
def numberOfArrays(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    n = len(s)
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp[n] = 1  # Base case: There's one way to restore the array from an empty string.

    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        if s[i] == '0':
            dp[i] = 0  # A number starting with '0' is invalid.
            continue

        num = 0
        for j in range(i, min(n, i + 10)):  # Limit to 10 digits to avoid overflow.
            num = num * 10 + int(s[j])
            if num > k:
                break
            dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[j + 1]) % MOD

    return dp[0]

# Example usage:
print(numberOfArrays("1000", 10000))  # Output: 1
print(numberOfArrays("1000", 10))      # Output: 0
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n \cdot \log_{10}(k))\) where \(n\) is the length of `s` and \(\log_{10}(k)\) is the maximum number of digits in `k`. This ensures that we efficiently iterate through the string while checking for valid numbers.

By following this strategy, we ensure that we check each possible valid number while leveraging dynamic programming to avoid unnecessary recalculations.
