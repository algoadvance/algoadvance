title:  Find the Maximum Length of Valid Subsequence I-out
permalink: /s3201
---

You are given a sequence or array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. A subsequence of `nums` is valid if the sum of the subsequence is less than or equal to `k`. You need to find the maximum length of such a valid subsequence.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Is the subsequence required to be contiguous?**
   - No, the subsequence does not have to be contiguous.
   
2. **Can the elements of the subsequence be taken in any order, or do they follow the original order?**
   - The elements must follow the original order of `nums`.

3. **What is the range of values for `nums`?**
   - The array `nums` can contain both positive and negative integers.
   
4. **What is the length range for `nums` and the value range for `k`?**
   - This should be specified in the problem constraints, but we'll assume reasonably large sizes.

### Strategy:

1. **Sort and Greedy Approach:**
   - First, we sort the array in non-decreasing order. This way, we can try to include the smallest elements first to maximize the length of the subsequence while keeping the sum within the limit.

2. **Iterate and Sum:**
   - Start from the beginning of the sorted array, add elements to our subsequence as long as the sum does not exceed `k`.

### Code:

Here is the Python code to implement the above strategy:

```python
def maxLengthSubsequence(nums, k):
    nums.sort()
    current_sum = 0
    max_length = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        if current_sum + num <= k:
            current_sum += num
            max_length += 1
        else:
            break
    
    return max_length

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
k = 10
print(maxLengthSubsequence(nums, k))  # Output: 4 (subsequence could be [1, 2, 3, 4])
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Sorting:** The time complexity of the sort operation is \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array.
- **Iteration:** After sorting the array, iterating through it takes \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity of this solution is \(O(n \log n)\).
