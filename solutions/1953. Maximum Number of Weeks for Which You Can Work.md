**1953. Maximum Number of Weeks for Which You Can Work**

You are given an integer array milestones where each `milestones[i]` represents a milestone to be completed at a specific event. You can work on completing the milestones in any order, but at most `milestones[i]` tasks for the same event milestone can be completed consecutively. You are working continuously and can pick different milestones in any order.

Return the maximum number of weeks you can work if you maintain this rule.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the elements of the milestones array always positive integers?**
   - Yes, milestones are positive integers.

2. **Is the array of milestones guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, the array is non-empty.

3. **Can all milestones be completed consecutively without switching?**
   - No, you cannot work on the same event milestone consecutively beyond its given count in `milestones[i]`.

### Strategy

The crux of the problem is ensuring that you do not get stuck with a scenario where the largest milestone forces you to stop work prematurely because there are no other milestones available to alternate.

To solve this:
1. Sort the milestones in descending order so that we always deal with the largest milestone first.
2. We will tally the sum of all milestones.
3. For the array `milestones`, if the sum of all milestones minus the largest milestone (`sum(milestones) - max_milestone`) is at least equal to or greater than the largest milestone, we can perform work equal to the sum of all milestones.
4. Otherwise, the maximum weeks we can schedule work is `2 * (sum(total milestones) - max_milestone) + 1`.

### Code

```python
def numberOfWeeks(milestones):
    total_milestones = sum(milestones)
    max_milestone = max(milestones)

    if total_milestones - max_milestone >= max_milestone:
        return total_milestones
    else:
        return 2 * (total_milestones - max_milestone) + 1

# Example usage
milestones = [1, 2, 3]
print(numberOfWeeks(milestones))  # Output should be 6

milestones = [5, 2, 1]
print(numberOfWeeks(milestones))  # Output should be 7
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the Milestones**: While we technically donâ€™t need an explicit sort operation, the calculations involve considering the extremes which is `O(n)` operation for finding the max and the sum.
- **Maximum Milestones Calculation**: It is `O(1)` since it involves simple arithmetic operations.

Total Time Complexity:

- **O(n)** - which is efficient for a simple pass through the list to find the total sum and maximum.

This ensures we handle the input in a scalable and efficient manner.
