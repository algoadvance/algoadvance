title:  Longest Common Subsequence-out
permalink: /s1143

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence. If there is no common subsequence, return 0.

A subsequence of a string is a new string generated from the original string with some characters (can be none) deleted without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of `text1` and `text2`?
     - Each string `text1` and `text2` can have a length up to 1000.
   
2. **Case Sensitivity:**
   - Should the comparison be case-sensitive?
     - Yes, the comparison should be case-sensitive.
   
3. **Empty Strings:**
   - How should we handle empty strings?
     - If either `text1` or `text2` is an empty string, the longest common subsequence should be 0.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use Dynamic Programming (DP). The idea is to use a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subsequence of `text1[0:i]` and `text2[0:j]`.

#### Steps:
1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a 2D array `dp` of size `(len(text1) + 1) x (len(text2) + 1)` and initialize all elements to 0.
   
2. **DP Transition:**
   - If `text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1` because the characters match and we add 1 to the length of the subsequence.
   - If `text1[i-1] != text2[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])` because we have to consider the maximum length by ignoring the current character from either `text1` or `text2`.

3. **Result:**
   - The value at `dp[len(text1)][len(text2)]` will be the length of the longest common subsequence.

### Code

```python
def longestCommonSubsequence(text1, text2):
    m, n = len(text1), len(text2)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]

    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if text1[i - 1] == text2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])

    return dp[m][n]

# Example usage:
# text1 = "abcde"
# text2 = "ace"
# Output: 3 (The longest common subsequence is "ace")
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(m \times n)\), where \(m\) is the length of `text1` and \(n\) is the length of `text2`, because we need to fill out the entire dp table.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(m \times n)\) for the `dp` table. We could optimize the space to \(O(\min(m, n))\) by using only two arrays of size \(n\) or \(m\), but the above solution uses the entire 2D array for simplicity.
