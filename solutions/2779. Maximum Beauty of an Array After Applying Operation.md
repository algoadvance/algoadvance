title:  Maximum Beauty of an Array After Applying Operation-out
permalink: /s2779
---
You are given an array `nums` and an integer `k`. You can perform the following operation on the array any number of times:
- Choose any index `i` and increment or decrement `nums[i]` by any integer value in the range `[0, k]` (both inclusive).

The "beauty" of an array is defined as the length of the longest contiguous subarray that contains no duplicate values.

Return the maximum beauty of the array you can achieve by applying the operation any number of times.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of input sizes**: What is the possible size range of the array `nums`?
2. **Value range**: What are the possible values in the `nums` array and the value of `k`?
3. **Edge cases**: Should we consider arrays with a single element or empty arrays?

Suppose the range of input sizes and values follows typical constraints in similar problems:
- `1 <= len(nums) <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= k <= 10^9`

## Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we need to consider transforming `nums` such that we maximize the length of the longest contiguous subarray with distinct elements. Here's a high-level approach:

1. **Identify Valid Intervals**: Determine the valid range `[nums[i] - k, nums[i] + k]` for each element `nums[i]` after applying the operation.
2. **Sliding Window Technique**: Use a sliding window to find the longest contiguous subarray where all elements fall within their valid transformed intervals and maintain distinct values.

### Steps:
1. **Transform Valid Ranges**: Construct an array where each element is replaced by a range `[lower, upper]` given by `[nums[i]-k, nums[i]+k]`.
2. **Sort Events**: Sort the start and end of the ranges. This helps in efficiently checking the valid positions using a sliding window.
3. **Sliding Window for Maximum Length**: Use a sliding window to determine the longest subarray that fits within the transformed valid range and has distinct elements.

## Code
Hereâ€™s the Python implementation:

```python
def maximumBeauty(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    events = []
    
    for num in nums:
        lower = num - k
        upper = num + k
        events.append((lower, 'start'))
        events.append((upper + 1, 'end'))
    
    events.sort()
    
    max_beauty = 0
    current_beauty = 0
    distinct_set = set()
    
    for val, typ in events:
        if typ == 'start':
            if val in distinct_set:
                continue
            current_beauty += 1
            distinct_set.add(val)
            max_beauty = max(max_beauty, current_beauty)
        elif typ == 'end':
            if val - 1 not in distinct_set:
                continue
            current_beauty -= 1
            distinct_set.remove(val - 1)
    
    return max_beauty

# Example usage
nums = [1, 3, 5, 8]
k = 2
print(maximumBeauty(nums, k))  # Output should be the maximum beauty of the array
```

## Time Complexity
- Sorting the events: \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array.
- Traversing the events: \(O(n)\) because we append every event type (start/end).
- Total complexity: \(O(n \log n)\). This is efficient enough given the constraints.

This approach ensures we calculate the maximum beauty by effectively managing the valid ranges using the sliding window technique.
