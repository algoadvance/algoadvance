title:  Closest Nodes Queries in a Binary Search Tree-out
permalink: /s2476
---

We are given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST) and an array of queries. For each query, the task is to find the value in the BST that is closest to the query value. If there are multiple values with the same distance, return the smallest one.

The problem can be accessed on LeetCode [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/closest-nodes-queries-in-a-binary-search-tree/).

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we return if the BST is empty?**
   - We will assume that the BST is not empty as per standard constraints given in the problem.
2. **What is the range of values in the tree nodes and queries?**
   - Typically, BST nodes and queries are constrained by the problem to be within certain large integer ranges.

## Strategy

1. **In-order traversal**:
   - Perform an in-order traversal of the BST to get the nodes in a sorted order.
2. **Binary search**:
   - For each query, perform binary search on the sorted list of nodes to find the position where the query would fit.
   - Compare the closest values to the left and right of that position to determine the closest node.
3. **Edge cases**:
   - If the query is smaller than the smallest node or larger than the largest node, handle these edge cases appropriately.

## Code

Here's the code implementation:

```python
from typing import List, Optional
import bisect

# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def closest_nodes_queries(root: Optional[TreeNode], queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    def in_order_traversal(node: Optional[TreeNode], sorted_vals: List[int]) -> None:
        if node:
            in_order_traversal(node.left, sorted_vals)
            sorted_vals.append(node.val)
            in_order_traversal(node.right, sorted_vals)
    
    # Perform in-order traversal to get sorted node values
    sorted_vals = []
    in_order_traversal(root, sorted_vals)
    
    result = []

    # Function to find the closest node using binary search
    for query in queries:
        pos = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_vals, query)
        
        closest_val = float('inf')
        if pos < len(sorted_vals) and abs(sorted_vals[pos] - query) < abs(closest_val - query):
            closest_val = sorted_vals[pos]
        if pos > 0 and abs(sorted_vals[pos - 1] - query) < abs(closest_val - query):
            closest_val = sorted_vals[pos - 1]

        result.append(closest_val)
    
    return result

# Example usage
# You can create a BST and test the function with sample queries to ensure correctness.
```

## Time Complexity

1. **In-order traversal**: 
   - O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the BST. This is required to generate the sorted list of node values.
   
2. **Binary search**:
   - Each query will be handled in O(log N) time using binary search to find the closest position.
   - Additionally, checking adjacent nodes is O(1) for each query.
   - Thus, for Q queries, it will be O(Q log N).

**Overall time complexity**: O(N + Q log N), where N is the number of nodes in the BST and Q is the number of queries.

This approach is efficient and leverages the BST properties effectively.
