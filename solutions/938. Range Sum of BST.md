title:  Range Sum of BST-out

---

Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST) and two integers `low` and `high`, return the sum of the values of all nodes with a value in the inclusive range `[low, high]`.

#### Example:
1. Input: `root = [10, 5, 15, 3, 7, null, 18]`, `low = 7`, `high = 15`
   - Output: `32`
   - Explanation: The nodes with values 7, 10, and 15 are in the range [7, 15]. They sum up to 32.

2. Input: `root = [10, 5, 15, 3, 7, 13, 18, 1, null, 6]`, `low = 6`, `high = 10`
   - Output: `23`
   - Explanation: The nodes with values 6, 7, and 10 are in the range [6, 10]. They sum up to 23.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the input tree always a valid BST?**
   - Yes, the problem guarantees that the tree is a valid BST.
  
2. **Are the values of the nodes always integers?**
   - Yes, the problem specifies the integer node values.
  
3. **Can the input tree include negative values?**
   - The problem does not specify, but typically, node values can be negative integers.

4. **Are `low` and `high` always within the range of node values?**
   - Yes, `low` and `high` are integers, and they are used to find nodes within a specified range.

### Strategy

Given that it's a BST, properties like the left subtree having smaller values and the right subtree having larger values can be leveraged to efficiently navigate the tree:

1. **Traversal Approach**: An In-Order DFS (Depth-First Search) will ensure visiting nodes in non-decreasing order.
   
2. **Optimization**:
   - If the current node's value is less than `low`, skip the left subtree because all values there will also be less than `low`.
   - If the current node's value is greater than `high`, skip the right subtree because all values there will also be greater than `high`.
   
3. **DFS Implementation**:
   - If the current node value is within `[low, high]`, add it to the sum.
   - Recursively check the left and right subtrees based on the comparison with `low` and `high`.

### Code

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def rangeSumBST(root: TreeNode, low: int, high: int) -> int:
    def dfs(node: TreeNode) -> int:
        if not node:
            return 0
        if node.val < low:
            # Only right subtree could have nodes in range
            return dfs(node.right)
        elif node.val > high:
            # Only left subtree could have nodes in range
            return dfs(node.left)
        else:
            # Current node is in range, check both subtrees
            return node.val + dfs(node.left) + dfs(node.right)
    
    return dfs(root)
```

### Time Complexity
- **Best-case**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the BST.
  - This happens in cases where all nodes' values are within the range `[low, high]`.
- **Average-case**: O(h), where h is the height of the BST.
  - In a balanced BST, h â‰ˆ log(n).
  
This time complexity is efficient given the properties of the BST and the constraints of the problem.
