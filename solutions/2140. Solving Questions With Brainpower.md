title:  Solving Questions With Brainpower-out
permalink: /s2140
---

You are given a 2D array `questions` where `questions[i] = [points_i, brainpower_i]`. 

- The array represents a sequence of questions, where `points_i` is the points you can earn by solving the i-th question, and `brainpower_i` indicates how many subsequent questions you need to skip if you solve this question.
  
Return the maximum points you can earn by solving the questions optimally.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can we skip questions even if we do not solve any?
   - Yes, you can skip any questions.
   
2. Are the values in `points_i` and `brainpower_i` guaranteed to be non-negative integers?
   - Yes, all values are non-negative integers.

3. Is there a minimum or maximum length for the input `questions`?
   - The length of the `questions` array can vary, but typically constraints are given in the problem's prompt.

### Strategy

This problem can be approached using dynamic programming (DP). Here's the breakdown of the strategy:

1. Define a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum points you can earn starting from the i-th question to the end.
2. Iterate from the end of the `questions` array towards the beginning:
   - For each question, calculate two scenarios:
     1. Skip the current question and get the same value as `dp[i + 1]`.
     2. Solve the current question, add the points of this question, and then look ahead by the brainpower value (if it goes out of bounds, take 0).
3. The value in `dp[0]` will be the result, which is the maximum points we can earn starting from the beginning.

### Code

```python
from typing import List

def mostPoints(questions: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    n = len(questions)
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)  # dp[i] will be the max points from question i to the end
    
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        points, brainpower = questions[i]
        skip = dp[i + 1]  # skip the current question
        solve = points + (dp[i + brainpower + 1] if i + brainpower + 1 < n else 0)  # solve the current question
        dp[i] = max(skip, solve)
    
    return dp[0]

# Example usage:
questions = [[3, 2], [4, 3], [4, 4], [2, 5]]
print(mostPoints(questions))  # Output: 5
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of questions. We iterate through the list once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, for the DP array.

This approach ensures we are efficiently computing the maximum points with a clear dynamic programming strategy.
