title:  Minimum Average Difference-out
permalink: /s2256
---

You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` of **n** integers.

The **average difference** of the index `i` is the **absolute difference** between the average of the first `i + 1` elements of `nums` and the average of the last `n - i - 1` elements. Both averages should be rounded down to the nearest integer.

Return the index with the **minimum average difference**. If there are multiple such indices, return the smallest one.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [2,0,1,5,6]
Output: 2

Explanation:
- The average difference for index 0 is |2 / 1 - (0 + 1 + 5 + 6) / 4| = |2 - 3| = 1.
- The average difference for index 1 is |(2 + 0) / 2 - (1 + 5 + 6 ) / 3| = |1 - 4| = 3.
- The average difference for index 2 is |(2 + 0 + 1) / 3 - (5 + 6) / 2| = |1 - 5| = 4.
- The average difference for index 3 is |(2 + 0 + 1 + 5) / 4 - 6 / 1| = |2 - 6| = 4.
- The average difference for index 4 is |(2 + 0 + 1 + 5 + 6) / 5 - 0| = |2 - 0| = 2.

The average difference for index 2 is the minimum so we return 2.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What are the size limits of the array `nums` (`n`)? 
      - The array size is between 1 and 100,000.
    - What are the value limits of the elements in `nums`?
      - Element values are between `0` and 10^5.

2. **Output Requirements**:
    - Return the smallest index if there are multiple indices with the same minimum average difference.

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - Single element arrays. 
    - Arrays where all elements are the same.

### Strategy

The task requires calculating average differences at multiple indexes efficiently. To optimize, we can use prefix sums to avoid recalculating sums repeatedly:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
    - Calculate prefix sums to quickly derive sums of array slices.

2. **Loop through the Indexes**:
    - For each index, calculate:
        - The average of the first `i + 1` elements.
        - The average of the last `n - i - 1` elements.
    - Calculate the absolute difference.

3. **Determine the Minimum Average Difference**:
    - Track the minimum difference and its index.

### Implementation

```python
def minimumAverageDifference(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    if n == 1:
        return 0
    
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Compute prefix sums
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + nums[i]
    
    min_diff = float('inf')
    min_index = -1
    
    for i in range(n):
        left_sum = prefix_sum[i + 1]
        left_avg = left_sum // (i + 1)
        
        if i == n - 1:
            right_avg = 0
        else:
            right_sum = prefix_sum[n] - prefix_sum[i + 1]
            right_avg = right_sum // (n - i - 1)
        
        abs_diff = abs(left_avg - right_avg)
        
        if abs_diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = abs_diff
            min_index = i
    
    return min_index

# Example Usage
nums = [2,0,1,5,6]
print(minimumAverageDifference(nums))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: `O(n)`
2. **Difference Calculation Loop**: `O(n)`

Overall time complexity is `O(n)`, making the solution efficient and scalable for large inputs.

### Additional Edge Case

The provided edge case examples should work well within the given approach:
- Single element arrays: the function should return `0` as there is only one index.
- Arrays where all elements are the same should also return `0` since the average difference will be `0` for any index.
