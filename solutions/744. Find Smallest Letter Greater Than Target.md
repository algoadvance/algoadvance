title:  Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target-out
permalink: /s744
---
Given an array of characters `letters` that is sorted in non-decreasing order and a character `target`, your task is to find the smallest character in the array that is lexicographically greater than `target`. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in the array.

You can assume that:
- `letters` has at least 2 characters.
- All the characters in `letters` are in lowercase and are sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `target` is a lowercase letter.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the `target` character be in the `letters` array?
   - Yes, it can be in the array.
   
2. What should be returned if all characters in `letters` are less than or equal to `target`?
   - If all characters in the `letters` array are less than or equal to `target`, return the first character in the array.
   
3. Are there any constraints on the size of the `letters` array?
   - The problem does not specify an explicit constraint, but it can be assumed to handle typical input sizes efficiently.

### Strategy
1. **Binary Search:** To efficiently find the smallest character greater than `target`, a binary search algorithm can be employed because the `letters` array is sorted.
2. **Circular Array Concept:** If the target is greater than or equal to the last character in the array, the function should wrap around to the beginning of the array and return the first character because it is the smallest character greater than `target` by circular array logic.

### Code

```python
def nextGreatestLetter(letters, target):
    left, right = 0, len(letters) - 1
    
    # Check if all characters are less than or equal to target
    if target >= letters[-1]:
        return letters[0]
    
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if letters[mid] <= target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid
    
    return letters[left]

# Example usage
letters = ["c", "f", "j"]
target = "a"
print(nextGreatestLetter(letters, target))  # Output: "c"
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial Check:** If `target` is greater than or equal to the last character in `letters`, return the first character in `letters`.
2. **Binary Search Logic:**
   - Initialize `left` and `right` pointers to the start and end of the array.
   - Use binary search to narrow down the indices:
     - If `letters[mid]` is less than or equal to `target`, search in the right half by setting `left = mid + 1`.
     - Else, search in the left half by setting `right = mid`.
   - The loop exits when `left` and `right` point to the same index, which will be the smallest character greater than `target`.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is **O(log n)** because it uses binary search.
- The space complexity is **O(1)** as no additional space is required apart from the input and variables.
