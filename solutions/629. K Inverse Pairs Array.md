title:  K Inverse Pairs Array-out
permalink: /s629
---
Given two integers `n` and `k`, return the number of different arrays consisting of numbers from 1 to `n` such that there are exactly `k` inverse pairs. The answer can be large, so return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

An inverse pair is a pair of indices `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and `nums[i] > nums[j]`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What are the constraints on `n` and `k`?**
   - `1 <= n <= 1000`
   - `0 <= k <= 1000`

2. **What should be returned if there are no possible arrays meeting the condition?**
   - If there are no arrays that meet the condition, the result should be 0.

3. **Should we consider arrays that contain repeated elements?**
   - No, the array should consist of distinct integers from 1 to `n`.

### Strategy:

The problem can be solved using a dynamic programming approach:

1. **Define a DP Array:**
   - Let `dp[n][k]` represent the number of arrays consisting of numbers `1` to `n` with exactly `k` inverse pairs.

2. **Base Case:**
   - For `n = 0` and `any k > 0`, `dp[0][k] = 0`. There's no array to form inverse pairs.
   - For any `n`, `dp[n][0] = 1` because an array with no inverse pairs is just a sorted sequence from 1 to `n`.

3. **Recursive Relation:**
   - When creating the `n`th element, one can place it in `i` different positions (`0` to `n-1`):
     - If the number `n` is placed at the end, no new inverse pairs are created.
     - If placed at the second-to-last position, one new inverse pair is created, and so on.
   - This gives the relation:
     - `dp[n][k] = dp[n-1][k] + dp[n-1][k-1] + ... + dp[n-1][k-(n-1)]` where valid indices are non-negative.
   - We can optimize this with prefix sum to avoid redundant calculations.

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Since the result can be very large, we take `mod = 10^9 + 7` to ensure values remain manageable.

### Code:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def kInversePairs(n: int, k: int) -> int:
    if k == 0: 
        return 1
    if n == 0: 
        return 0
    
    dp = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 1
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        dp[i][0] = 1  # 0 inverse pairs
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j-1] + dp[i-1][j]) % MOD
            if j >= i:
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] - dp[i-1][j-i] + MOD) % MOD
    
    return dp[n][k]

# Example Usage
n = 3
k = 1
print(kInversePairs(n, k))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n * k), since we have nested loops iterating over `n` and `k` with efficient prefix-sum utilization.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n * k), as we are using a 2D list to store the dynamic programming states.
