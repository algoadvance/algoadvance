title:  Minimum Time to Make Array Sum At Most x-out
permalink: /s2809
---

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `x`. In each operation, you can:

1. Remove the leftmost or the rightmost element from `nums`.
2. Subtract its value from `x`.

Return the minimum number of operations required to reduce `x` to at most 0. If itâ€™s not possible, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints:** What is the range of the values in `nums` and `x`?
   - Typically, these constraints can help define the feasibility of certain approaches.
   
2. **Array Properties:** Can the array contain negative numbers, or is it strictly non-negative?
   - Negative numbers might complicate the solution approach.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Smallest case where `nums` has only one element.
   - Case where `x` is 0 to begin with.

### Strategy

1. **Total Sum Check:** First, compute the total sum of the array. If the total sum is less than `x`, it's impossible to achieve the required reduction, so we return `-1`.

2. **Sliding Window Technique:**
   - Compute the target sum to be achieved from a subarray such that the sum of the remaining elements outside this subarray is closest to `x`.
   - Use a sliding window to find the largest subarray with a sum equal to `tot_sum - x`.
   - Calculate the number of remaining operations as `len(nums) - len(subarray_with_target_sum)`.

### Code

Let's write the code based on the strategy described:

```python
def minOperations(nums, x):
    total_sum = sum(nums)
    if total_sum < x:
        return -1
    
    target = total_sum - x
    n = len(nums)
    max_length_subarray = -1
    current_sum = 0
    left = 0
    
    for right in range(n):
        current_sum += nums[right]
        
        while current_sum > target and left <= right:
            current_sum -= nums[left]
            left += 1
            
        if current_sum == target:
            max_length_subarray = max(max_length_subarray, right - left + 1)
    
    return -1 if max_length_subarray == -1 else n - max_length_subarray

# Example Usage
nums = [1, 1, 4, 2, 3]
x = 5
print(minOperations(nums, x))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The sliding window passes through the array at most twice (once with the `right` pointer and at most once with the `left` pointer in total), leading to an O(n) complexity.
- **Space Complexity:** We use a constant amount of extra space, hence O(1) space complexity.

This solution efficiently handles the problem within the constraints typically expected in coding interviews.
