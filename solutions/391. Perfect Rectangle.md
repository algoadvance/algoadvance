title:  Perfect Rectangle-out
permalink: /s391
---
Given a collection of `n` axis-aligned rectangles where `rectangles[i] = [x1, y1, x2, y2]` represents the coordinates of the bottom-left and top-right corners of the `i-th` rectangle, find out if they all together form an exact cover of a rectangular region.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Disjoint Rectangles**: Are all rectangles guaranteed to be disjoint?
   - No, rectangles might overlap and the goal is to check if they form a perfect rectangle without gaps or overlaps.

2. **Coordinates**: What is the range of coordinates for the rectangles?
   - The problem doesn't specify constraints explicitly, but it can be assumed they fit within the typical input sizes used in competitive programming.

3. **Input Size**: What is the maximum number of rectangles (`n`)?
   - This detail is important for understanding performance constraints, but let's assume it fits typical competitive programming limits (0 < n â‰¤ 1000).

### Strategy
To determine if the given set of rectangles forms a perfect rectangle covering a rectangular region:
1. **Boundary Check**: Calculate the boundaries (minimum x and y, and maximum x and y) of the complete area formed by all rectangles.
2. **Area Check**: Sum the areas of all rectangles and verify if it matches the area of the boundary rectangle formed by the above coordinates.
3. **Corner Points Check**: For a perfect rectangle to form, we should have specific corners appearing once. We will use a set to track the corners appearing an odd number of times.

### Implementation
```python
def isRectangleCover(rectangles):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Points dictionary to store the count of each point
    points = defaultdict(int)
    area = 0
    min_x = min_y = float('inf')
    max_x = max_y = float('-inf')
    
    for rect in rectangles:
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = rect
        
        # Update boundaries of the overall covering rectangle
        min_x, min_y = min(min_x, x1), min(min_y, y1)
        max_x, max_y = max(max_x, x2), max(max_y, y2)
        
        # Add up the area of each small rectangle
        area += (x2 - x1) * (y2 - y1)
        
        # Update the points counts
        points[(x1, y1)] += 1
        points[(x2, y2)] += 1
        points[(x1, y2)] += 1
        points[(x2, y1)] += 1
    
    # The total area if it's a perfect cover
    expected_area = (max_x - min_x) * (max_y - min_y)
    if area != expected_area:
        return False
    
    # Four corners of the large rectangle must appear exactly once
    corners = {(min_x, min_y), (min_x, max_y), (max_x, min_y), (max_x, max_y)}
    
    for point, count in points.items():
        if count % 2 != 0:
            if point not in corners:
                return False
            corners.remove(point)
    
    return len(corners) == 0

# Example usage:
rectangles = [
   [1, 1, 3, 3],
   [3, 1, 4, 2],
   [3, 2, 4, 4],
   [1, 3, 2, 4],
   [2, 3, 3, 4]
]

print(isRectangleCover(rectangles))  # Output: True
```

### Time Complexity
- **Boundary Calculation**: O(n)
- **Area Calculation**: O(n)
- **Corner Points Check**: O(n)
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n)** where n is the number of rectangles. This is efficient given the typical constraints of the problem.
