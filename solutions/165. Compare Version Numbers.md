title:  Compare Version Numbers-out
permalink: /s165
---

You are given two version numbers, `version1` and `version2`, represented as strings. A version number consists of one or more revisions joined by a dot `'.'`. Each revision consists of digits and may contain leading zeros. Every revision contains at least one character. Revisions are **0-indexed** from left to right, with the leftmost revision being the highest significance. For example, `2.5.33` and `0.1` are valid version numbers.

To compare version numbers, compare their revisions in left-to-right order. Revisions are compared using their **integer value ignoring any leading zeros**. This means that `1.0` is considered the same as `1`, and `1.0.0` is considered the same as `1`.

Return the following:
- If `version1` < `version2`, return `-1`.
- If `version1` > `version2`, return `1`.
- Otherwise, return `0`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can we assume that the input strings are always valid version numbers?
   - Yes, you can assume the input strings are valid version strings.
2. Are there any constraints on the length of the version strings?
   - No, you can assume the length of the version strings is reasonable and fits within the problem constraints.

### Strategy
1. Split both `version1` and `version2` by the `'.'` delimiter to extract individual revisions as strings.
2. Convert these revisions to integers to handle the comparison correctly.
3. Compare corresponding revisions in a loop:
   - If one version has fewer revisions, treat the missing revisions as `0`.
4. Use a loop to compare the revisions.
5. Return `-1`, `1`, or `0` based on the comparison results.

### Code

```python
def compareVersion(version1: str, version2: str) -> int:
    # Split the version strings into lists of integers
    v1 = list(map(int, version1.split('.')))
    v2 = list(map(int, version2.split('.')))

    # Determine the maximum length of the version lists
    max_length = max(len(v1), len(v2))

    # Compare corresponding revisions
    for i in range(max_length):
        revision1 = v1[i] if i < len(v1) else 0
        revision2 = v2[i] if i < len(v2) else 0

        if revision1 < revision2:
            return -1
        elif revision1 > revision2:
            return 1

    # If all corresponding revisions are equal
    return 0
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m)
  - where `n` is the number of revisions in `version1` and `m` is the number of revisions in `version2`. We split both version strings and then iterate through the maximum length of the two lists of revisions.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n + m)
  - Space is used to store the lists of revisions for both version strings.

This implementation efficiently compares version numbers by parsing and comparing each revision numerically.
