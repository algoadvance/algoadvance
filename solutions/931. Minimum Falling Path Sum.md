title:  Minimum Falling Path Sum-out
permalink: /s931
---

The problem is: 

Given an `n x n` array of integers `matrix`, return the **minimum sum** of any falling path through `matrix`.

A falling path starts at any element in the first row and chooses one element from each row. The next row's choice must be in a column that is either the same, or immediately to the left or right of the previous row's column.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the elements of the matrix?**
   - Elements can range from `-100 <= matrix[i][j] <= 100`.

2. **What is the size range of the matrix?**
   - It is an `n x n` matrix, where `1 <= n <= 100`.

3. **Are there any constraints or specifications if `n` is 1?**
   - If `n` is 1, the minimum falling path sum would just be the value of the single element in the matrix.

### Strategy

The idea here is to use a dynamic programming approach where we construct a DP table that stores the minimum sum to reach each cell in the current row from any cell in the previous row.

1. **Define DP Table**: Let `dp[i][j]` be the minimum falling path sum to reach element `(i, j)`.

2. **Initialization**: Initialize the first row of `dp` to be the first row of the matrix itself, as there are no previous rows.

3. **Recurrence Relation**: For each subsequent row, calculate the minimum path sum for each element `(i, j)` as:
   ``` 
   dp[i][j] = matrix[i][j] + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i-1][j-1] if j > 0, dp[i-1][j+1] if j < n-1)
   ```
   
4. **Result**: The minimum value in the last row of the `dp` table gives us the minimum falling path sum.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) where `n` is the number of rows (or columns) in the matrix, as we need to traverse each element in the matrix and check three possible previous positions.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n^2) for the DP table, but it can be optimized to O(n) by re-using rows to save space.

### Code

```python
def minFallingPathSum(matrix):
    n = len(matrix)
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Initialize the first row of dp array
    for j in range(n):
        dp[0][j] = matrix[0][j]
    
    # Fill the dp table
    for i in range(1, n):
        for j in range(n):
            min_above = dp[i-1][j]
            if j > 0:
                min_above = min(min_above, dp[i-1][j-1])
            if j < n - 1:
                min_above = min(min_above, dp[i-1][j+1])
            dp[i][j] = matrix[i][j] + min_above
    
    # The minimum path sum will be the minimum value in the last row of dp
    return min(dp[-1])

# Example usage
matrix = [
  [2,1,3],
  [6,5,4],
  [7,8,9]
]
print(minFallingPathSum(matrix))  # Output should be 13
```

This code initializes a DP table and fills it row-wise, computing the minimum path sum to each element using the mentioned recurrence relation. Finally, it returns the smallest value from the last row of the DP table, which represents the minimum falling path sum through the entire matrix.
