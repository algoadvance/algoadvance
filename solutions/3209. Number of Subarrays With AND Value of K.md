title:  Number of Subarrays With AND Value of K-out
permalink: /s3209
---
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of non-empty subarrays such that the bitwise AND of all the elements in the subarray is exactly equal to `k`.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the array size and element values?**
   - This helps to understand if a brute force solution is feasible or if we need an optimized approach.

2. **Is the output expected to be the number of subarrays or their actual content?**
   - Given the typical problem description, it will be the number of subarrays.

3. **Are there any constraints on the values of `k`?**
   - If `k` is extremely large relative to possible values in `nums`, it can invalidate the possibility of certain subarrays.

4. **Can the subarrays consist of a single element?**
   - This helps to determine the necessity to check single-element subarrays.

### Strategy
1. **Initial Observation**
   - Since AND operation with `k` needs to equal `k`, this means every number in the subarray must have the bit in all places where `k` has bit 1. If any element in the subarray has a 0 in a position where `k` has a 1, it will invalidate the subarray.

2. **Brute Force Approach**
   - Generate all possible subarrays and check if their bitwise AND matches `k`.

3. **Optimized Approach**
   - Use a sliding window or two-pointer approach where we maintain a current AND for a subarray and expand/contract the window to maintain the AND condition.

### Code
Below is a Python implementation of the optimized approach:

```python
def subarrayAND(vals, k):
    count = 0
    n = len(vals)
    for start in range(n):
        current_and = vals[start]
        for end in range(start, n):
            current_and &= vals[end]
            if current_and == k:
                count += 1
            elif current_and < k:
                break  # If the AND falls below k, no further extension will work
    return count

# Example Usage
nums = [1, 2, 4, 8]
k = 2
print(subarrayAND(nums, k))  # Expected Output: number of subarrays with AND = k
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initial Analysis**
   - The brute-force method: Generate all O(n^2) subarrays and compute the AND for each, leading to O(n^3) time complexity.

- **Optimized Analysis**
   - The outer loop runs `n` times, and in the worst case, the inner loop also runs `n` times resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2). However, the inner loop often breaks early due to the condition `current_and < k`.

### Conclusion
This approach efficiently counts the number of subarrays with AND value exactly `k` by leveraging early termination when the AND condition falls below `k`.
