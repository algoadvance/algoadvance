### Problem Statement

**2925. Maximum Score After Applying Operations on a Tree-out**

Given a tree (an undirected, connected acyclic graph) with `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n-1`, you are given the `n-1` edges of the tree. Each node has a corresponding value in the list `values`, and you're allowed to perform the following operation on each node any number of times:
- Choose a node `i` and add the value of `values[i]` to all of its direct children.

Design a function to find the maximum possible score you can achieve on the tree.

**Clarifying Questions:**
1. Can values inside the list `values` be negative?
2. Can we assume all nodes are connected correctly as a tree (no cycles, and there's exactly `n-1` edges for `n` nodes)?
3. Do we need to consider the impact of potentially adding the same value multiple times on more deeply nested children?

### Strategy

1. **Tree Representation:** First, we'll represent the tree using an adjacency list.
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** We'll use DFS to traverse and compute the maximum score possible for each subtree.
3. **Dynamic Programming on Trees:** We'll use a recursive function with memoization to efficiently calculate the maximum possible score for each node.

The main idea is to propagate the values from each node to its children and calculate the cumulative effects to get the maximum score.

### Time Complexity

- **Building the Adjacency List:** \(O(n)\)
- **DFS Traversal and Computation:** \(O(n)\)

So, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\).

### Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from functools import lru_cache

def max_score_after_operations(n, edges, values):
    # Build the adjacency list for the tree
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        tree[u].append(v)
        tree[v].append(u)
        
    # Cache for memoization
    @lru_cache(None)
    def dfs(node, parent):
        # Directly consider the node value
        score = values[node]

        # Traverse children
        for child in tree[node]:
            if child != parent:
                # Add the child's value after performing the operation
                score += max(0, dfs(child, node))
        
        return score
        
    # Perform DFS from the root (0 or any arbitrary node as root)
    return dfs(0, -1)

# Example Usage:
n = 5
edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]]
values = [1, 2, -4, -2, 3]
print(max_score_after_operations(n, edges, values))  # Output: Expected maximum score
```

### Explanation

1. **Adjacency List Construction:** We iterate over the edges and build the tree using a dictionary where each node points to its list of children.
2. **DFS with Memoization:** We define a DFS function with memoization to avoid redundant calculations. The function `dfs(node, parent)` calculates the maximum score starting from `node`, excluding the `parent` to avoid traversing back up the tree.
3. **Score Calculation:** For each node, the score starts with its value, and we add the maximum score calculated for each child (if benefiting from the operation) to it.

This approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the maximum possible score by leveraging tree traversal combined with dynamic programming principles.
