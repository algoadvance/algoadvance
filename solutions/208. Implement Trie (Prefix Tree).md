title:  Implement Trie (Prefix Tree)-out
permalink: /s208
---

A **Trie** (pronounced as "try") or **prefix tree** is a tree data structure used to efficiently store and retrieve keys in a dataset of strings. There are various applications of this data structure, such as autocomplete and spell checker.

Implement a Trie with the following methods:
- `Trie()`: Initializes the trie object.
- `void insert(String word)`: Inserts the string `word` into the trie.
- `boolean search(String word)`: Returns true if the string `word` is in the trie (i.e., was inserted before), and false otherwise.
- `boolean startsWith(String prefix)`: Returns true if there is a previously inserted string that has the prefix `prefix`, and false otherwise.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Case Sensitivity**: Should the trie treat "Apple" and "apple" as different strings?
   - Let's assume case-sensitivity is respected (this needs to be confirmed if in a real scenario).
  
2. **Characters Allowed**: Should we only consider lowercase English letters for simplicity?
   - Yes, for simplicity we will only consider lowercase English letters.

3. **Consecutive Inserts and Searches**: Can we assume that the methods will be called multiple times and independently?
   - Yes, the methods can be called in any sequence.

## Strategy

### Trie Node
- Each node in the Trie will contain:
  - A dictionary `children` where each key is a character and the value is another Trie node.
  - A boolean `is_word` to mark the end of a word.

### Trie
- Initialize: Create the root node (an empty Trie node).
- Insert: Traverse the Trie based on characters of the word; create new nodes as necessary and mark the end of the word.
- Search: Traverse the Trie based on characters of the word; ensure all characters exist and the final node is marked as a word.
- StartsWith: Like search, but only verify the existence of the characters without needing to check the `is_word` flag.

## Code

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.is_word = False

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, word: str) -> None:
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                node.children[char] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[char]
        node.is_word = True

    def search(self, word: str) -> bool:
        node = self.root
        for char in word:
            if char not in node.children:
                return False
            node = node.children[char]
        return node.is_word

    def startsWith(self, prefix: str) -> bool:
        node = self.root
        for char in prefix:
            if char not in node.children:
                return False
            node = node.children[char]
        return True
```

## Time Complexity

- **Insert**: O(n) where n is the length of the word to insert.
- **Search**: O(n) where n is the length of the word to search.
- **StartsWith**: O(n) where n is the length of the prefix.

Here, creating/traversing nodes takes linear time with respect to the length of the word or prefix being processed.
