title:  Find The First Player to win K Games in a Row-out
permalink: /s3175
---

You are given a list of game results where each element in the list represents a player (either 'A' or 'B') who won that specific game. Your task is to find the first player who wins `K` consecutive games. If no player wins `K` games in a row, return an empty string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the game results always valid and contain only 'A' or 'B'?
   - Yes, assume the input list only contains 'A' or 'B'.

2. What should be returned if `K` is greater than the length of the list?
   - Return an empty string, as it's not possible for any player to win `K` games in a row.

3. Can we assume that `K` is always greater than 0?
   - Yes, you can assume that `K` is always a positive integer.

### Strategy

1. Initialize two counters: `count_A` and `count_B` to track the consecutive wins for player 'A' and player 'B' respectively.
2. Loop through the list of game results:
   - If the current game result is 'A', increment `count_A` and reset `count_B`.
   - If the current game result is 'B', increment `count_B` and reset `count_A`.
   - After updating the counters, check if either `count_A` or `count_B` reached `K`. If so, return the corresponding player.
3. If the loop completes without finding any player with `K` consecutive wins, return an empty string.

### Code

```python
def find_first_winner_k_games(game_results, K):
    count_A = 0
    count_B = 0
    
    for result in game_results:
        if result == 'A':
            count_A += 1
            count_B = 0
        elif result == 'B':
            count_B += 1
            count_A = 0
        
        if count_A == K:
            return 'A'
        if count_B == K:
            return 'B'
    
    return ""

# Example usage:
game_results = ['A', 'A', 'B', 'B', 'B', 'A', 'A', 'A']
K = 3
print(find_first_winner_k_games(game_results, K))  # Output: "B"
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the `game_results` list. This is because we only loop through the list once, making comparisons and updates in constant time.
