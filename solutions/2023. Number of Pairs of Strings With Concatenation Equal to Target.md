title:  Number of Pairs of Strings With Concatenation Equal to Target-out
permalink: /s2023
---

Given an array of digit strings `nums` and a digit string `target`, return the number of pairs of indices `(i, j)` (where `i != j`) such that the concatenation of `nums[i] + nums[j]` equals `target`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input and Output Types:**
   - Can `nums` contain empty strings?
   - What is the expected output if no such pairs exist?
   - Are the digit strings guaranteed to be non-negative?

2. **Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the `nums` list?
   - What is the maximum length of each string inside `nums` and the `target` string?

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we can follow the steps below:
1. Initialize a counter to track the number of pairs.
2. Iterate through each pair of indices `(i, j)` in the `nums` list.
3. For each pair, concatenate `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`.
4. Check if the concatenated string equals `target`.
5. If it matches, increment the counter.
6. Return the counter after finishing the iteration.

To optimize the solution, notice that for each string in `nums`:
- We can check if the prefix matches part of the `target` and if the remaining part exists in the list.

### Code

```python
def numOfPairs(nums, target):
    count = 0
    n = len(nums)
    
    # Use a nested loop to check each pair of indices
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(n):
            if i != j and nums[i] + nums[j] == target:
                count += 1
    
    return count
```

### Strategy Explanation

1. **Initialization:** 
   - We start by initializing `count` to zero which will hold the number of valid pairs we find.

2. **Nested Loops:**
   - The outer loop runs from `0` to `n-1`. The inner loop also runs from `0` to `n-1`.
   - We need both `i` and `j` indices to explore all pairs in the list.

3. **Concatenation Check:**
   - For each pair `(i, j)`, we check if `i != j` to ensure the indices are not the same.
   - We concatenate `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` and check if the result matches `target`.

4. **Counting Matches:**
   - If the concatenated string matches `target`, we increment the counter.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n^2)`
  - We check every pair of strings, leading to a double loop through `nums`. Each concatenation operation and comparison is `O(1)` assuming average string lengths are constant.
  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
  - We use a constant amount of extra space aside from the input data.

This brute-force approach provides a clear and direct solution but could be optimized further. If performance is a concern, further optimizations involving hashing or prefix analysis could be explored.
