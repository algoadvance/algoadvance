Given a positive integer `n`, return the sum of all integers in the range `[1, n]` inclusive that are divisible by `3`, `5`, or `7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: What should the function return if `n` is less than `1`?**
   - A: Since `n` is defined as a positive integer, this scenario should not occur.

2. **Q: Are there any constraints on the size of `n`?**
   - A: The problem statement doesnâ€™t specify constraints, but understanding the typical range can inform our approach. If `n` is reasonably large, we should ensure our implementation efficiently handles it.

Assuming these points hold, let's proceed to the strategy and code.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate through the range**:
   - We'll iterate through the numbers from `1` to `n`.
  
2. **Check divisibility**:
   - For each number in this range, check if it's divisible by `3`, `5`, or `7`.

3. **Accumulate the sum**:
   - If a number is divisible by any of these, add it to a running total.

4. **Edge cases**:
   - Given `n` starts from `1`, an edge case might be where `n` is just `1` or slightly higher. The code should correctly handle these minimal edge cases.

### Code

```python
def sum_of_multiples(n: int) -> int:
    total_sum = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i % 3 == 0 or i % 5 == 0 or i % 7 == 0:
            total_sum += i
    return total_sum
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`
  - We iterate over each number from `1` to `n` once, making this a linear time operation.
  
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
  - We use a constant amount of extra space regardless of input size, primarily for the sum accumulator.
  
This approach should efficiently handle typical constraints by leveraging a straightforward iteration and conditional checks.
