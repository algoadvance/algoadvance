title:  Design Parking System-out
permalink: /s1603

You are tasked with designing a `ParkingSystem` class for a parking lot. The parking lot has three kinds of parking spaces: big, medium, and small. The number of each type of parking space is provided during the initialization of the `ParkingSystem` object. A method `addCar` is needed to check if there is a parking space available for a car of specified type, and park the car if there's a spot. The method should return `true` if the car is successfully parked, and `false` otherwise.

Here's the class definition:

```python
class ParkingSystem:

    def __init__(self, big: int, medium: int, small: int):
        pass

    def addCar(self, carType: int) -> bool:
        pass
```

- `carType`: 1 represents a big car, 2 represents a medium car, and 3 represents a small car.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can we assume that the given number of parking spaces (big, medium, small) are non-negative integers?
2. Should we consider thread safety in our implementation?
3. Is the parking system initialized once and used multiple times for querying, or do we need to reset it during the use case?

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: 
   - During the initialization, store the number of big, medium, and small parking spaces.
   
2. **Adding a Car**:
   - Based on the `carType` provided, check if there are available spaces in the respective parking category.
   - If space is available, decrement the space count for that category and return `true`.
   - If no space is available, return `false`.

### Code

Here's the complete implementation of the `ParkingSystem` class:

```python
class ParkingSystem:

    def __init__(self, big: int, medium: int, small: int):
        self.big = big
        self.medium = medium
        self.small = small

    def addCar(self, carType: int) -> bool:
        if carType == 1:
            if self.big > 0:
                self.big -= 1
                return True
            else:
                return False
        elif carType == 2:
            if self.medium > 0:
                self.medium -= 1
                return True
            else:
                return False
        elif carType == 3:
            if self.small > 0:
                self.small -= 1
                return True
            else:
                return False
        else:
            return False  # Invalid car type
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: The `__init__` method runs in constant time, O(1), since it only sets up initial state variables.
- **addCar Method**: The `addCar` method also runs in constant time, O(1), as it only performs a few conditional checks and updates.

This solution ensures that adding a car to the parking system is efficient and quick, with a guaranteed O(1) time complexity per operation.
