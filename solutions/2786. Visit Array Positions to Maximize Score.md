title:  Visit Array Positions to Maximize Score-out
permalink: /s2786
---

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and a positive integer `x`.

You are initially **at** `nums[0]` and you can move to any position in the array `every second` with the following conditions:
1. You can move from the position `i` to the position `j` (where `i != j`) given that `|i - j| <= x`.

You can make `multiple movements` between any two positions as long as the conditions are satisfied.

Your goal is to maximize your total score where score is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between the values in `nums` at the positions you visit.

Return the **maximum score** you can achieve by visiting the elements in `nums`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Is `x` always guaranteed to be less than the length of `nums`? 
    - This ensures that we can always make at least one move if given the freedom to move within `x` distance.
2. Are there any constraints on the values within `nums`? 
    - This can help us understand the distribution of numbers for optimization.
3. Can we revisit any positions in `nums`?
    - If revisiting is allowed, it should be clear since revisiting could affect the score calculation.

Assuming:
1. `x` is strictly positive and fits within the problem constraints.
2. The values within `nums` can vary significantly and revisiting is not allowed unless explicitly mentioned. 

## Code

Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def maxScore(nums, x):
    n = len(nums)
    dp = [-float('inf')] * n
    dp[0] = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(max(0, i-x), i):
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + abs(nums[i] - nums[j]))
    
    return max(dp)

# Example usage
nums = [1, 5, 10, 4, 7]
x = 2
print(maxScore(nums, x))  # Expected output (example of how to use the function)
```

## Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming**: We can utilize a dynamic programming (DP) approach where `dp[i]` keeps track of the maximum score achievable to reach index `i`. 
2. **Initialization**: Initialize `dp[0]` as 0 as starting from `nums[0]` does not contribute any absolute difference.
3. **DP Transition**:
    - For each position `i`, check all positions `j` that lie within the range of `i-x` to `i-1`. This ensures we only move within the allowed distance.
    - Update `dp[i]` as the maximum of its current value and the possible score if moving from `j` to `i`.
4. **Result**: The maximum value in `dp` array gives the desired maximum score.

## Time Complexity

- The outer loop runs for `n` iterations.
- The inner loop can run up to `x` iterations for each outer loop iteration.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n * x)`, where `n` is the length of the `nums` array and `x` is the allowed movement distance.

This approach should handle typical constraint sizes effectively.
