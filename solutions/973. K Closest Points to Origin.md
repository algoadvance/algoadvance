title:  K Closest Points to Origin-out
permalink: /s973
---

Given an array of `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the X-Y plane and an integer `k`, return the `k` closest points to the origin (0, 0).

The distance between two points on the X-Y plane is the Euclidean distance (i.e., `sqrt((xi - 0)^2 + (yi - 0)^2)`). You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique (except for the order that it is in).

**Example 1:**
```
Input: points = [[1,3],[-2,2]], k = 1
Output: [[-2,2]]
Explanation: 
The distance between (1, 3) and the origin is sqrt(10).
The distance between (-2, 2) and the origin is sqrt(8).
Since sqrt(8) < sqrt(10), (-2, 2) is closer to the origin.
We only want the closest k = 1 points from the origin, so the answer is just [[-2, 2]].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]], k = 2
Output: [[3,3],[-2,4]]
Explanation: 
The distance between (3, 3) and the origin is sqrt(18).
The distance between (5, -1) and the origin is sqrt(26).
The distance between (-2, 4) and the origin is sqrt(20).
The closest two points are (3, 3) and (-2, 4).
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Should the function always return the points in increasing order of distance?**
   - No, it can return the closest points in any order.
   
2. **Can there be duplicate points in the input?**
   - Yes, it is possible but won't impact since only distance matters.

3. **Are there constraints on the values `xi` or `yi` can take?**
   - Typically, for competitive programming: \(|xi|, |yi| \leq 10^4\).

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will:
1. Calculate the Euclidean distance from each point to the origin.
2. Use a max-heap to store the distances and related points. By maintaining a heap of size `k`, we can efficiently keep track of the `k` smallest distances.
3. Once we've processed all points, the heap will contain the `k` closest points.

### Code

```python
import heapq
from typing import List

def kClosest(points: List[List[int]], k: int) -> List[List[int]]:
    # Using a max-heap, we can maintain the closest K points efficiently
    max_heap = []
    
    for (x, y) in points:
        dist = -(x**2 + y**2) # negative distance for max-heap
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, (dist, (x, y)))
        
        # Ensure that we have at most k points in the heap
        if len(max_heap) > k:
            heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    
    return [point for (_, point) in max_heap]

# Sample Usage
points = [[3,3],[5,-1],[-2,4]]
k = 2
print(kClosest(points, k))
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Heap Operations**: Inserting and popping from the heap are \(O(\log k)\) operations.
2. **Total Operations**: We iterate over all `n` points and perform heap operations for each, making it \(O(n \log k)\).
3. **Space Complexity**: We maintain a heap of size `k`, so \(O(k)\).

In summary, our approach ensures we find the `k` closest points in efficient time and space, even for larger inputs.
