title:  Longest Unequal Adjacent Groups Subsequence I-out
permalink: /s2900
---

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. An adjacent group of characters is a group of consecutive characters that are all the same in the string. For example, in the string "abaaaacc", the groups are 'a', 'b', 'aaaa', 'cc'. The function `longestUnequalGroupsSubsequence(s)` should return the longest subsequence where no two adjacent groups are equal.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input string be empty?** 
    - No, an input string `s` with at least one character will be provided.

2. **What should the function return?** 
    - The length of the longest subsequence of groups where no two adjacent groups in the sequence are equal.

3. **Are there any constraints on the length of the string?**
    - The string's length will be between 1 and \(10^5\), inclusive.

4. **What characters does the string contain?**
    - The string contains only lowercase English letters ('a' to 'z').

## Strategy

1. **Identify Groups:** First, identify all the groups of consecutive identical characters.
2. **Track Adjacent Groups:** Traverse the identified groups and track the longest subsequence where no two adjacent groups are the same.
3. **Return Result:** Count the length of this longest subsequence and return it.

## Code

```python
def longestUnequalGroupsSubsequence(s: str) -> int:
    if not s:
        return 0

    n = len(s)
    prev_char = s[0]
    groups = []
    count = 1

    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] == prev_char:
            count += 1
        else:
            groups.append(prev_char * count)
            prev_char = s[i]
            count = 1
    
    # Add the last group
    groups.append(prev_char * count)

    # Initialize the longest subsequence count
    longest_length = 1
    current_length = 1

    for i in range(1, len(groups)):
        if groups[i] != groups[i - 1]:
            current_length += 1
            longest_length = max(longest_length, current_length)
        else:
            current_length = 1

    return longest_length

# Example usage:
print(longestUnequalGroupsSubsequence("abaaaacc"))  # Expected output: 4
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Identify Groups:** Takes O(n) time to traverse through the string once to identify all groups.
2. **Track Adjacent Groups:** Takes O(m) time where `m` is the number of groups, which in the worst case can be O(n).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n), where `n` is the length of the string, which is efficient for the input size constraints.
