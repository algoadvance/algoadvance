title:  Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String-out
permalink: /s28
---

## Problem Statement:
You need to implement a function `strStr(haystack: str, needle: str) -> int` that finds the first occurrence of the substring `needle` in the string `haystack`. If `needle` is an empty string, return 0. If `needle` is not present in `haystack`, return -1.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. What should be returned if both `haystack` and `needle` are empty?
   - As per the problem, return 0 if `needle` is an empty string.
2. Should the function consider case sensitivity?
   - Yes, typically this type of function considers case sensitivity.

## Strategy:
We'll start with a straightforward approach known as the "Sliding Window" or "Two-pointer" technique.

### Steps:
1. If `needle` is empty, return 0.
2. Iterate through `haystack` with a window size equal to the length of `needle`.
3. During iteration, check if the current window in `haystack` matches `needle`.
4. If a match is found, return the starting index of that window.
5. If no match is found after the iteration, return -1.

Using this approach ensures we check each possible starting position in the `haystack` string, verifying if `needle` begins there.

## Time Complexity:
- Let `n` be the length of `haystack` and `m` be the length of `needle`.
- We will examine up to `n - m + 1` starting positions in `haystack`, and each comparison takes `O(m)` time.
- The overall time complexity is `O(n * m)`.

Now, let's implement this in Python.

## Code:
```python
def strStr(haystack: str, needle: str) -> int:
    # If needle is an empty string
    if not needle:
        return 0
    
    # Lengths of haystack and needle
    n = len(haystack)
    m = len(needle)
    
    # Loop through haystack with a window of size m
    for i in range(n - m + 1):
        # Check if the substring of length m starting at i matches needle
        if haystack[i:i + m] == needle:
            return i
    
    # If no match is found, return -1
    return -1
```

### Explanation:
1. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If `needle` is empty, return 0 immediately.
   
2. **Iteration**:
   - The loop `for i in range(n - m + 1)` ensures we don't go out of bounds while checking substrings of length `m` in `haystack`.
   
3. **SubString Check**:
   - We use slicing `haystack[i:i + m]` to extract the current window and compare it directly with `needle`.
   
4. **Return the Index**:
   - If a match is found, return the starting index `i`.
   - If the loop completes without finding a match, return -1.

This solution is straightforward and adheres closely to the problem's requirements. Let me know if you need any further explanations or optimizations!
