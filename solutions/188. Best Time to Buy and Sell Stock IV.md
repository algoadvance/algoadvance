title:  Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV-out
permalink: /s188

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i-th` day, and an integer `k`.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most `k` transactions.

**Note:**
- You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**
```
Input: k = 2, prices = [2,4,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 2) and sell on day 2 (price = 4), profit = 4-2 = 2.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: k = 2, prices = [3,2,6,5,0,3]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 2) and sell on day 3 (price = 6), profit = 6-2 = 4. Then buy on day 5 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. What if `k` is 0? 
   - In this case, the maximum profit is `0` since no transactions can be made.
2. Can `prices` be empty?
   - Yes, and in that case, the maximum profit is also `0`.
3. Are there any constraints on the values within `prices`?
   - All values in `prices` would be non-negative integers.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use Dynamic Programming (DP). We can define `dp[i][j]` as the maximum profit on day `j` with at most `i` transactions.

The steps to set up the solution include:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a 2D DP array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` is the maximum profit obtainable at day `j` with at most `i` transactions.
   - If there are no transactions allowed, or no days, the maximum profit is `0`.

2. **DP Transition:**
   - For each transaction `i` from `1` to `k`, and for each day `j` from `1` to `n-1`:
     - We calculate `dp[i][j]` as the maximum of:
       - Not doing any transaction on day `j` (`dp[i][j-1]`).
       - Performing a transaction, which requires looping over all previous days `m` to find the maximum value of `prices[j] - prices[m] + dp[i-1][m]`.

3. **Optimization Insight:**
   - Instead of re-calculating the maximum profit for each day `m`, we can use a variable to keep track of the maximum profit up to day `j` using a clever relation that can be derived from the problem constraints. This reduces the need for a full nested loop, leading to an O(n^2 * k) complexity.

## Code

```python
def maxProfit(k: int, prices: List[int]) -> int:
    if not prices:
        return 0

    n = len(prices)
    if k >= n // 2:
        # If we can complete more transactions than really needed
        profit = 0
        for i in range(1, n):
            if prices[i] > prices[i - 1]:
                profit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1]
        return profit

    # Initialize dp array
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(k + 1)]

    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        max_diff = -prices[0]
        for j in range(1, n):
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j - 1], prices[j] + max_diff)
            max_diff = max(max_diff, dp[i - 1][j] - prices[j])
    
    return dp[k][n - 1]
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this approach is `O(k * n)`, where `k` is the number of allowed transactions, and `n` is the number of days in the `prices` array. This is efficient given the constraints and optimizes the nested loop strategy by keeping track of the maximum difference efficiently.

- The space complexity is `O(k * n)` due to the creation of the DP array.
