title:  Count Pairs of Connectable Servers in a Weighted Tree Network-out
permalink: /s3067
---

You are given a tree (an undirected, connected, acyclic graph) with `n` nodes, where each node is numbered from 1 to `n`. The `i-th` edge connects nodes `u[i]` and `v[i]` with weight `w[i]`. A pair of servers (nodes) is connectable if there's a path between them that has weights of all edges within a given range `[L, R]`. Your task is to count the number of connectable pairs of servers.

**Input:**
- `n`: an integer representing the number of nodes.
- `edges`: a list of tuples `(u, v, w)` where `u` and `v` are nodes and `w` is the weight of the edge between them.
- `L`: an integer representing the lower bound of the edge weights.
- `R`: an integer representing the upper bound of the edge weights.

**Output:**
- Return the number of connectable pairs of servers.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. Are L and R inclusive for the range of acceptable weights?
2. What are the constraints on `n` and the weights `w` of the edges?
3. Are the edges guaranteed to be in the given range `[1, n-1]`?

Let's assume the following constraints:
- \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
- \(1 \leq w[i], L, R \leq 10^9\)

### Strategy:

1. **Filter Edges:** Extract edges whose weights fall within the range `[L, R]` as other edges are irrelevant for this problem.
   
2. **Union-Find Algorithm:** Use Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union - DSU) to dynamically track the connectivity of the nodes within the acceptable weight range.
   
3. **Count Pairs Using Union-Find:**
   - Initialize Union-Find data structure to manage the nodes.
   - For each edge within the range, union its endpoints and keep track of how the components are merging.
   - Use a size array to keep the size of each component; the number of connectable pairs in each component of size `s` is given by \(C(s, 2) = \frac{s(s-1)}{2}\).

4. **Sum Connectable Pairs:** Sum the connectable pairs for all components to get the result.

### Time Complexity:

- Filtering edges: \(O(n)\)
- Union-Find Operations: Nearly \(O(n \cdot \alpha(n))\) where \(\alpha\) is the inverse Ackermann function, which is very small (essentially near constant).

### Code:

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.parent = list(range(size))
        self.rank = [1] * size
        self.size = [1] * size  # Keep track of the size of each set

    def find(self, node):
        if self.parent[node] != node:
            self.parent[node] = self.find(self.parent[node])
        return self.parent[node]

    def union(self, node1, node2):
        root1 = self.find(node1)
        root2 = self.find(node2)

        if root1 != root2:
            if self.rank[root1] > self.rank[root2]:
                self.parent[root2] = root1
                self.size[root1] += self.size[root2]
            elif self.rank[root1] < self.rank[root2]:
                self.parent[root1] = root2
                self.size[root2] += self.size[root1]
            else:
                self.parent[root2] = root1
                self.size[root1] += self.size[root2]
                self.rank[root1] += 1
            return self.size[root1] if self.rank[root1] >= self.rank[root2] else self.size[root2]
        else:
            return self.size[root1]

def countPairsInWeightedTree(n, edges, L, R):
    # Filter edges within the weight range [L, R]
    filtered_edges = [edge for edge in edges if L <= edge[2] <= R]
    
    # Initialize Union-Find structure
    uf = UnionFind(n)
    
    # Process each edge and count the pairs by tracking component sizes
    component_sizes = {}
    
    for u, v, w in filtered_edges:
        new_size = uf.union(u - 1, v - 1)
        root = uf.find(u - 1)
        component_sizes[root] = new_size

    # Sum the number of pairs in each component
    total_pairs = sum(size * (size - 1) // 2 for size in component_sizes.values())

    return total_pairs

# Example Usage:
n = 4
edges = [(1, 2, 3), (2, 3, 4), (3, 4, 5)]
L, R = 3, 5
print(countPairsInWeightedTree(n, edges, L, R))  # Example output could be the number of connectable pairs
```

This implementation ensures an efficient solution leveraging Union-Find to dynamically manage connectivity and count pairs within the acceptable weight range.
