title:  Knight Probability in Chessboard-out
permalink: /s688
---

You are given an `n x n` chessboard and a knight. Initially, the knight is positioned at coordinates `(row, column)`. You need to find the probability that the knight remains on the chessboard after making exactly `k` moves.

The knight moves in an L-shape: it can move two squares in one direction (horizontal or vertical) and then one square in the perpendicular direction. Given the initial position of the knight, determine the probability that after `k` moves, the knight will still be on the chessboard.

The movements can be in any of the following directions:
- (2, 1) 
- (1, 2) 
- (-1, 2) 
- (-2, 1) 
- (-2, -1) 
- (-1, -2) 
- (1, -2) 
- (2, -1) 

## Clarifying Questions

1. What are the constraints on `n`, `k`, `row`, and `column`?
   - Constraints: 
     * `1 <= n <= 25`
     * `0 <= k <= 100`
     * `0 <= row, column < n`
2. Are there any constraints on the type of input (all integers)?
   - Yes, all inputs are integers.
3. Are we supposed to consider the chessboard as 0-indexed or 1-indexed?
   - The chessboard is considered 0-indexed.

## Strategy

1. **Define Movement**: All possible moves of a knight can be captured in a list of tuples.
2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - We'll use a DP table where `dp[i][j][m]` defines the probability of the knight being at position `(i, j)` after `m` moves.
   - Initialize `dp[row][column][0] = 1` because the knight starts at the initial position with probability 1.
   - For each move from `1` to `k`, update the possible positions based on previous moves while ensuring the new positions are within the board.
3. **Sum Probabilities**: After `k` moves, sum up the probabilities of all positions to get the result.

## Code

```python
def knightProbability(n: int, k: int, row: int, column: int) -> float:
    # Directions a knight can move
    directions = [(2, 1), (1, 2), (-1, 2), (-2, 1), (-2, -1), (-1, -2), (1, -2), (2, -1)]
    
    # DP table initialized with zeros
    dp = [[[0 for _ in range(k + 1)] for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(n)]
    
    # The initial position with 0 moves: probability is 1
    dp[row][column][0] = 1
    
    # Iterate over number of moves
    for move in range(1, k + 1):
        for r in range(n):
            for c in range(n):
                # If there's a probability to be at (r, c) with move-1
                if dp[r][c][move - 1] > 0:
                    for dr, dc in directions:
                        new_r, new_c = r + dr, c + dc
                        # Check if the new position is within bounds
                        if 0 <= new_r < n and 0 <= new_c < n:
                            dp[new_r][new_c][move] += dp[r][c][move - 1] / 8.0
    
    # Calculate the total probability of the knight being on the board after k moves.
    result = 0
    for r in range(n):
        for c in range(n):
            result += dp[r][c][k]
    
    return result

# Example Usage
n = 3
k = 2
row = 0
column = 0
print(knightProbability(n, k, row, column))  # Output: The probability the knight is on the board after 2 moves
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n^2 \cdot k \cdot 8) \approx O(n^2 \cdot k)\), where `n` is the size of the chessboard and `k` is the number of moves.
- The space complexity is also \(O(n^2 \cdot k)\) due to the DP table size.
