title:  Binary Search Tree to Greater Sum Tree-out
permalink: /s1038
---
Given the `root` of a Binary Search Tree (BST), transform it into a Greater Sum Tree (GST) where every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST. 

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can we assume that the BST has at least one node?
   - Yes, assume the BST has at least one node.
2. Is the tree node values range small enough to avoid integer overflow?
   - Yes, assume the values are within a safe range for Python integers.
3. Should we modify the tree in-place?
   - Yes, the problem intends for an in-place transformation of the tree.
4. Can there be duplicate values in the BST?
   - Typically, a standard BST does not contain duplicate values, assume no duplicates.

### Strategy:
A key insight is that a BST’s in-order traversal yields values in ascending order. To transform it into a Greater Sum Tree, we can do a reverse in-order traversal (right -> node -> left) so we can accumulate the sum of all nodes processed so far and update each node’s value accordingly.

### Steps:
1. Perform a reverse in-order traversal of the BST.
2. Maintain a running sum of all node values processed so far.
3. For each node, update its value to the current value plus the running sum.
4. Update the running sum to include the current node’s original value.
5. Continue the traversal.

### Code:
```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        
def bstToGst(root: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
    def reverse_in_order_traversal(node, acc_sum):
        if not node:
            return acc_sum
        # Process the right subtree
        acc_sum = reverse_in_order_traversal(node.right, acc_sum)
        # Update the current node's value
        node.val += acc_sum
        # Update the accumulated sum
        acc_sum = node.val
        # Process the left subtree
        acc_sum = reverse_in_order_traversal(node.left, acc_sum)
        return acc_sum

    reverse_in_order_traversal(root, 0)
    return root
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Every node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This space is used for the call stack in recursion. In the worst case, the height of the tree can be n (skewed tree) and in the best case, the space complexity will be log(n) (balanced tree). 

### Summary:
The provided solution efficiently transforms the BST into a GST by performing a reverse in-order traversal, maintaining an accumulated sum of processed nodes, and updating each node in-place.
