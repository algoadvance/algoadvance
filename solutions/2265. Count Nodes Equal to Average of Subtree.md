title:  Count Nodes Equal to Average of Subtree-out
permalink: /s2265
---

You are given the root of a binary tree.

For each node in the tree, find the average value of the nodes in the sub-tree rooted at that node. Return the number of nodes where the node's value is equal to the average of the values in its sub-tree.

A sub-tree of a node is the tree consisting of that node and all its descendants.

#### Example:
```
Input: root = [4,8,5,0,1,null,6]
Output: 5
Explanation:
For the node with value 4 -> The average of its subtree is (4+8+5+0+1+6) / 6 = 4.
For the node with value 8 -> The average of its subtree is (8+0+1) / 3 = 3.
For the node with value 5 -> The average of its subtree is (5+6) / 2 = 5.5.
For the node with value 0 -> The average of its subtree is 0 / 1 = 0.
For the node with value 1 -> The average of its subtree is 1 / 1 = 1.
For the node with value 6 -> The average of its subtree is 6 / 1 = 6.
Thus, the number of nodes where the node's value is equal to the average of the values in its subtree is 5.
```
Note:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
- The value of the nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 1000]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What kind of tree is this?**
   This is a binary tree.

2. **What is the expected output?**
   The number of nodes where the node’s value is equal to the average of its subtree.

### Strategy

1. **Traverse the Tree**: Use a post-order traversal to process each node after its children.
2. **Calculate Sum and Count**: For each subtree, calculate the sum of values and the count of nodes.
3. **Compare Node Value to Average**: After calculating the sum and node count of the subtree, compute the average and compare it to the node’s value.
4. **Count Matching Nodes**: Keep a counter for nodes whose value equals the computed average.

### Code

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def averageOfSubtree(root: TreeNode) -> int:
    def post_order(node: TreeNode) -> (int, int):
        if not node:
            return (0, 0)
        
        left_sum, left_count = post_order(node.left)
        right_sum, right_count = post_order(node.right)
        
        total_sum = left_sum + right_sum + node.val
        total_count = left_count + right_count + 1
        
        if node.val == total_sum // total_count:
            self.count += 1
        
        return (total_sum, total_count)

    self.count = 0
    post_order(root)
    return self.count
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The algorithm visits each node once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h) where h is the height of the tree due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (skewed tree), h can be n. In the best case (balanced tree), h is log(n).

This approach and solution should efficiently solve the problem within the constraints provided.
