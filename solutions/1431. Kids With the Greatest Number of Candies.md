title:  Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies-out
permalink: /s1431
---
You are given an integer array `candies`, where each `candies[i]` represents the number of candies the `i-th` kid has, and an integer `extraCandies`, denoting the number of extra candies you have. 

Return a boolean array `result` where `result[i]` is `True` if, after giving the `i-th` kid all the `extraCandies`, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or `False` otherwise.

### Example
```python
Input: candies = [2, 3, 5, 1, 3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [True, True, True, False, True]
Explanation: 
Kid 1: 2 + 3 = 5, greatest number of candies.
Kid 2: 3 + 3 = 6, greatest number of candies.
Kid 3: 5 + 3 = 8, greatest number of candies.
Kid 4: 1 + 3 = 4, not greatest number of candies.
Kid 5: 3 + 3 = 6, greatest number of candies.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the number of candies be negative?
   - No, the number of candies is always a non-negative integer.
   
2. What is the maximum length of the `candies` array?
   - Constraints are generally such that `1 <= candies.length <= 100` and `0 <= candies[i] <= 100`.

3. Are there any constraints on the value of `extraCandies`?
   - `1 <= extraCandies <= 50`.

### Strategy
1. Identify the maximum number of candies one kid currently has.
2. For each kid, calculate their total number of candies if they received all the `extraCandies`.
3. Check if the new total is greater than or equal to the maximum number of candies found in step 1.
4. Record `True` if it is, otherwise record `False`.

### Time Complexity
- Finding the initial maximum candy count is O(n).
- Checking each kid's total candies count is O(n).
- Overall time complexity: O(n).

### Code

```python
def kids_with_candies(candies, extraCandies):
    max_candies = max(candies)  # Find the maximum number of candies any kid currently has
    result = []
    
    for candy in candies:
        # Check if giving current kid all the extraCandies makes their total >= max_candies
        if candy + extraCandies >= max_candies:
            result.append(True)
        else:
            result.append(False)
    
    return result

# Example usage
candies = [2, 3, 5, 1, 3]
extraCandies = 3
print(kids_with_candies(candies, extraCandies))  # Output: [True, True, True, False, True]
```

### Explanation
1. First, we determine the maximum number of candies that any kid currently has, which is 5.
2. For each kid, we check if their candies plus the `extraCandies` is greater than or equal to 5.
3. We construct a result list based on this check.

This approach ensures we efficiently determine which kids can have the greatest number of candies by distributing the extra candies.
