title:  Fibonacci Number-out
permalink: /s509
---
The problem at hand is about calculating the Fibonacci numbers, which is a classic problem. Given an integer `n`, we need to compute the `n-th` Fibonacci number. The Fibonacci sequence is defined by the following recurrence relation:
- F(0) = 0
- F(1) = 1
- F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2) for n > 1

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Should we consider very large values of `n`?
   **A:** The constraints typically ensure that `n` is a manageable size; for LeetCode, it's usually within the range [0, 30].
2. **Q:** Are negative values of `n` possible in the input?
   **A:** No, `n` is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

### Strategy
1. **Iterative Approach:** Use a bottom-up approach to compute the Fibonacci number iteratively. This helps in reducing the space complexity significantly.
2. **Dynamic Programming (DP):** Store the previously computed Fibonacci numbers to avoid redundant calculations.

### Code
Here is an implementation using the iterative approach:

```python
def fib(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    
    # Initial base values for the sequence
    a, b = 0, 1
    
    # Iteratively compute the nth Fibonacci number
    for _ in range(2, n + 1):
        a, b = b, a + b
    
    return b

# Example Usage
print(fib(0))  # Output: 0
print(fib(1))  # Output: 1
print(fib(2))  # Output: 1
print(fib(3))  # Output: 2
print(fib(10))  # Output: 55
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
  - We iterate from 2 to `n`, so the time complexity is linear with respect to `n`.

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\)
  - We only use a constant amount of extra space (variables `a` and `b`) regardless of the input size.

This approach ensures that we compute the Fibonacci number efficiently with minimal space usage.
