title:  Minimize Result by Adding Parentheses to Expression-out
permalink: /s2232
---

You are given a numeric string `expression` representing a simple expression of the form "a+b". Your goal is to add a pair of parentheses to the expression such that after the addition, the resulting expression evaluates to the smallest possible value.

The input expression will be a string of the form "a+b":
- `a` and `b` are positive integers without leading zeros.
- The expression contains exactly one plus sign.

Return the resulting expression that has the parentheses added in the optimal position.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the maximum length of `a` and `b`?
    - Are there any constraints on the values of `a` and `b` such as maximum length or value?

    *Response: The constraints are typically manageable within standard integer ranges in competition-style problems.*

2. **Output**:
    - Should the output include any spaces or should it be a continuous string?
    
    *Response: The output should be a continuous string without spaces.*

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - What should the output be if the length of `a` or `b` is 1?

    *Response: The solution should still return the minimized result considering all possible parentheses placement.*

### Strategy

To determine the optimal placement of parentheses, the algorithm can follow these steps:

1. Parse the input string to extract `a` and `b`.
2. Iterate through all possible positions to add parentheses around the sum part of the expression:
    - For each position, calculate the value of the resulting expression.
    - Track the position that yields the minimum result.
3. Generate the new expression string with parentheses in the position that gives the minimum evaluated result.

This involves iterating over each possible way to split and insert parentheses and evaluating the expression to find the minimum value.

### Code

```python
def minimizeResult(expression: str) -> str:
    # Splitting the input into a and b
    a, b = expression.split('+')
    
    min_value = float('inf')
    min_expression = ""
    
    for i in range(len(a)):
        for j in range(1, len(b) + 1):
            # form new expressions with parentheses
            left = a[:i] if i > 0 else "1"
            right = b[j:] if j < len(b) else "1"
            middle = a[i:] + '+' + b[:j]
            # Calculate value of the expression
            current_value = eval(left + '*' + '(' + middle + ')' + '*' + right)
            
            if current_value < min_value:
                min_value = current_value
                min_expression = a[:i] + '(' + middle + ')' + b[j:]
    
    return min_expression

# Example usage:
expression = "12+34"
print(minimizeResult(expression))  # Output should be something like "1(2+3)4"
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution can be analyzed as follows:
- Splitting the expression into `a` and `b` takes `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input string.
- We then have nested loops iterating over all possible splits of `a` and `b`. In the worst case, this requires `O(n^2)` iterations.
- Each iteration involves forming a string and evaluating an expression, both of which are `O(1)` operations concerning the length of `a` and `b`.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n^2)` where `n` is the length of the input string. This is efficient given the constraint that `a` and `b` are reasonably small.
