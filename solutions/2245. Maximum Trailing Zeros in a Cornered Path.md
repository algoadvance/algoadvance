title:  Maximum Trailing Zeros in a Cornered Path-out
permalink: /s2245
---

Given a `m x n` matrix of integers `grid`, you have to find a path through the grid starting from the top-left cell `(0, 0)` and going to the bottom-right cell `(m-1, n-1)`. The path should only move right or down at each step. 

A "cornered path" is defined as a path that moves either only right for a while or only down for a while and then switches to only moving down or right. 

Your task is to return the maximum number of trailing zeroes in any path from `(0, 0)` to `(m-1, n-1)`.

A trailing zero in an integer is any zero at the end of the integer's decimal representation.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Can the grid contain negative numbers? (Assuming only positive integers for simplicity)
   - What is the maximum size of the grid `m` x `n`? 

2. **Expected Output**:
   - Should we return the integer value of the maximum number of trailing zeros?

For the current purpose, we'll assume:
- The grid contains only positive integers.
- The size of the grid is reasonably large, such as `1 <= m, n <= 1000`.

### Strategy

To solve the problem effectively, consider the following steps:

1. **Count Factors**:
   - Trailing zeros are contributed by factors of 2 and 5. Hence, along the path, keep track of the number of `2`s and `5`s separately in a prefix sum grid.
   
2. **Build Prefix Count Grids**:
   - Construct two prefix sum grids that record counts of `2`s and `5`s from `(0,0)` to any `(i,j)` in all directions.

3. **Path Formation**:
   - For each position in the grid, you can form paths by switching once between right and down:
     - Move right then down
     - Move down then right

4. **Calculate Trailing Zeros**:
   - From the prefix counts, determine the maximum trailing zeros possible by checking minimum of counts of `2`s and `5`s.

### Code

Here is the Python code to implement that strategy:

```python
from typing import List

def count_factors(x, factor):
    count = 0
    while x % factor == 0 and x > 0:
        x //= factor
        count += 1
    return count

def maxTrailingZeros(grid: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    
    # Initialize prefix sum arrays for factor 2 and factor 5
    prefix_2 = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    prefix_5 = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            val = grid[i][j]
            count2 = count_factors(val, 2)
            count5 = count_factors(val, 5)
            
            prefix_2[i+1][j+1] = count2 + prefix_2[i+1][j] + prefix_2[i][j+1] - prefix_2[i][j]
            prefix_5[i+1][j+1] = count5 + prefix_5[i+1][j] + prefix_5[i][j+1] - prefix_5[i][j]
    
    max_trailing_zeros = 0
    
    # Examine all paths
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            total_2_right_down = prefix_2[i+1][n] - prefix_2[i+1][j] + prefix_2[m][j+1] - prefix_2[i][j+1]
            total_5_right_down = prefix_5[i+1][n] - prefix_5[i+1][j] + prefix_5[m][j+1] - prefix_5[i][j+1]
            
            total_2_down_right = prefix_2[m][j+1] - prefix_2[i][j+1] + prefix_2[i+1][n] - prefix_2[i+1][j]
            total_5_down_right = prefix_5[m][j+1] - prefix_5[i][j+1] + prefix_5[i+1][n] - prefix_5[i+1][j]
            
            max_trailing_zeros = max(max_trailing_zeros, 
                                     min(total_2_right_down, total_5_right_down),
                                     min(total_2_down_right, total_5_down_right))
    
    return max_trailing_zeros
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity for counting factors within each element is `O(logV)` where `V` is the maximum value in the grid.
- Constructing the prefix sums for `2`s and `5`s takes `O(m * n)` operations.
- Evaluating all possible paths takes `O(m * n)` operations.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(m * n * logV)`.
