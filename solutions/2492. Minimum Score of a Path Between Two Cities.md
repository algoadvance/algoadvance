title:  Minimum Score of a Path Between Two Cities-out
permalink: /s2492
---

You are given a positive integer `n` representing n cities numbered from 1 to n. You are also given a 2D array `roads` where `roads[i] = [a_i, b_i, distance_i]` indicates that the city `a_i` and city `b_i` are connected by a direct road of length `distance_i`. The goal is to find the minimum score (minimum distance of any road in the path) of a path between city 1 and city n.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What does the "path" refer to?**
   - The path refers to any sequence of roads connecting city 1 to city n.
   
2. **What does the "score" refer to?**
   - The score of a path is the smallest edge (road) distance on that path.

3. **Can roads have negative distances?**
   - No, roads have positive integer distances as described in the problem statement.

4. **Does every city have at least one road connected to it?**
   - The problem doesn't specify, but we can assume the input will ensure that there is at least one valid path between city 1 and city n.

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation:** We can represent the cities and roads using an adjacency list.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Algorithm:** We can use BFS to explore all possible paths from city 1 to city n. During the BFS process, we can track the minimum edge distance encountered.
3. **Tracking Minimum Score:** While traversing the paths, we continuously update a variable to hold the smallest road length encountered.

### Code


```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

def minScore(n: int, roads: List[List[int]]) -> int:
    # Build the graph
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for a, b, distance in roads:
        graph[a].append((b, distance))
        graph[b].append((a, distance))
    
    # BFS Initialization
    queue = deque([1])
    visited = set([1])
    min_score = float('inf')
    
    while queue:
        current_city = queue.popleft()
        
        for neighbor, distance in graph[current_city]:
            # Update minimum score
            min_score = min(min_score, distance)
            
            if neighbor not in visited:
                visited.add(neighbor)
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    return min_score

# Example Usage
n = 4
roads = [[1, 2, 9], [2, 3, 6], [2, 4, 5], [1, 4, 7]]
print(minScore(n, roads))  # Output should be 5
```

### Explanation

1. **Graph Construction:** We use a dictionary to store an adjacency list, where each key is a city, and the value is a list of tuples (neighbor city, distance).
2. **BFS Initialization:** Start BFS from city 1, using a queue initialized with city 1 and a set to keep track of visited cities. Initialize `min_score` to a very large number.
3. **BFS Execution:** For each city in the queue, visit all its neighbors. During the visit, update the `min_score` with the smallest encountered distance. If a neighbor hasnâ€™t been visited, add it to the queue and mark it as visited.
4. **Return Result:** The smallest distance encountered during the BFS traversal is returned as the result.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The BFS algorithm in this context runs in O(E), where E is the number of roads, because in the worst case, each road is traversed once.
- **Space Complexity:** The space used is O(V + E), where V is the number of cities and E is the number of roads for the adjacency list representation and the various auxiliary data structures (queue and visited set).
