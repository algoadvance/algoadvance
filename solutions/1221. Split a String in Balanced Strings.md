The problem is taken from LeetCode, and it states:

**1221. Split a String in Balanced Strings**

Balanced strings are those that have an equal quantity of 'L' and 'R' characters.

Given a balanced string `s`, split it into the maximum number of balanced strings.

Return the maximum number of balanced strings.

**Example:**

- Example 1:
  ```
  Input: s = "RLRRLLRLRL"
  Output: 4
  Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "RRLL", "RL", "RL", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
  ```
  
- Example 2:
  ```
  Input: s = "RLLLLRRRLR"
  Output: 3
  Explanation: s can be split into "RL", "LLLRRR", "LR", each substring contains same number of 'L' and 'R'.
  ```
  
- Example 3:
  ```
  Input: s = "LLLLRRRR"
  Output: 1
  Explanation: s can be split into "LLLLRRRR".
  ```
  
**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s[i]` is either 'L' or 'R'.
- `s` is a balanced string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the string contain characters other than 'L' and 'R'?
   - No, the string will only contain 'L' and 'R'.
2. Is the input guaranteed to be a balanced string?
   - Yes, the input string `s` is guaranteed to be balanced.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Counters**: 
   - Use a counter to track the balance of 'L' and 'R'. Initialize it to `0`.
   - Use another counter to keep track of the number of balanced strings.

2. **Iterate Through String**:
   - For each character in the string:
     - Increment the balance counter if the character is 'R'.
     - Decrement the balance counter if the character is 'L'.
   - Whenever the balance counter reaches `0`, increment the count of balanced strings.

3. **Return Result**:
   - Return the count of balanced strings.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we iterate through the string once. The space complexity is **O(1)** since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

### Code

```python
def balancedStringSplit(s: str) -> int:
    balance = 0
    max_splits = 0
    
    for char in s:
        if char == 'R':
            balance += 1
        elif char == 'L':
            balance -= 1
        
        if balance == 0:
            max_splits += 1
    
    return max_splits

# Example usage
example_input_1 = "RLRRLLRLRL"
print(balancedStringSplit(example_input_1))  # Output: 4

example_input_2 = "RLLLLRRRLR"
print(balancedStringSplit(example_input_2))  # Output: 3

example_input_3 = "LLLLRRRR"
print(balancedStringSplit(example_input_3))  # Output: 1
```

This code effectively splits the given string into the maximum number of balanced substrings by maintaining a running balance of 'L' and 'R' characters and incrementing the split count every time this balance reaches zero.
