title:  Split Message Based on Limit-out
permalink: /s2468
---

You are given a message `message` with length `n` and an integer `limit`. You need to split the `message` into multiple parts, each of which does not exceed the given `limit`.

When splitting the message:

1. Every part should be in the format "part#<part_index>/<total_parts>" where:
    - `<part_index>` starts from 1.
    - `<total_parts>` is the total number of parts.
2. The message could be split at any position.

Return a list of strings representing the parts. If it is impossible to split the message within the given limit, return an empty list.

### Example
```python
message = "Thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog"
limit = 10
# Expected Output: ["part#1/4: Thequi", "part#2/4: ckbro", "part#3/4: wnfox", "part#4/4: jumpsoverthelazydog"]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we assume the input message contains only printable ASCII characters?**
   - Yes.

2. **Is whitespace allowed in the message and should it be preserved?**
   - Yes, whitespace should be preserved.

3. **Is there any specific format we need to follow for the message parts?**
   - Yes, each part should begin with "part#<part_index>/<total_parts>: " following the constraints.

4. **What happens if it's impossible to split the message according to the given limit?**
   - We return an empty list.

5. **Is there a constraint on the lengths of the message and the limit?**
   - It's not specified but assume typical constraints as in most interview problems.

## Strategy

1. Start by determining how many parts we might need. The main estimation comes from trying to fit as much content in each part accounting for the part identifiers (e.g., "part#1/4: ").
2. Deduct the length of part identifier from the limit to find the actual length available for the message in each part.
3. Estimate the required number of parts.
4. If the estimated length per part fits within the limit, split the message accordingly.
5. Construct the final list of message parts in the required format.

## Strategy Outline

1. Calculate the length constraint of the part identifiers.
2. Iterate with different values for the total number of parts until a valid split is found or you determine that splitting is impossible.
3. Construct the resultant list of parts.

## Time Complexity
- Constructing the split has a time complexity of O(n).

## Actual Implementation

```python
from typing import List

def split_message(message: str, limit: int) -> List[str]:
    n = len(message)
    
    for total_parts in range(1, n + 1):
        length_of_part_prefix = len(f"part#{total_parts}/{total_parts}: ")
        remaining_length = limit - length_of_part_prefix

        if remaining_length <= 0:
            continue
        
        est_message_length = remaining_length * total_parts
        
        if est_message_length >= n:
            parts = []
            current_index = 0
            
            for part_index in range(1, total_parts + 1):
                length_of_part_prefix = len(f"part#{part_index}/{total_parts}: ")
                remaining_length = limit - length_of_part_prefix
                
                if remaining_length <= 0:
                    break
                
                part_message = message[current_index:current_index + remaining_length]
                parts.append(f"part#{part_index}/{total_parts}: {part_message}")
                
                current_index += remaining_length
                if current_index >= n:
                    break
            
            if current_index >= n:
                return parts
    
    return []

# Example usage
message = "Thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog"
limit = 10
print(split_message(message, limit))
```

In this solution, we have implemented an iterative approach to determine how to split the input message. The function calculates the required parts by checking the viable part combinations, ensuring each part adheres to the limit constraint including the prefix format. If successful, it returns the appropriately formatted list, otherwise, it returns an empty list.
