title:  The Latest Time to Catch a Bus-out
permalink: /s2332
---
You are given the following inputs:
- `buses`: a list of integers where each integer represents the arrival time of a bus.
- `passengers`: a list of integers where each integer represents the arrival time of a passenger.
- `capacity`: an integer representing the maximum number of passengers that can board each bus.

Your task is to find the latest time you can arrive at the bus stop to catch a bus such that:
1. You end up catching a bus.
2. The time you choose to arrive is not the same as any of the given passengers' arrival times.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the arrival times for buses and passengers sorted?**
   - No, they could be in any order.
2. **Can multiple passengers arrive at the same time?**
   - Yes.
3. **Can multiple buses arrive at the same time?**
   - Yes.
4. **What if all buses are full and no bus can accommodate an additional passenger?**
   - In this case, you should consider the time just before the first bus arrival or an empty bus.
5. **What are the constraints on the values of the buses and passengers list and the capacity?**
   - Both lists and the capacity can have a maximum length of 10^5, and the times are between 1 and 10^9.

### Strategy
1. **Sort the Arrays**: Sort the `buses` and `passengers` lists.
2. **Initial Variables**:
   - `passenger_index` to keep track of which passenger we're considering next.
   - `last_valid_time` to store the last valid time a bus can be caught.
3. **Iterate Over Buses**:
   - For each bus, check its arrival time and see how many passengers can board it without exceeding capacity.
   - Update `last_valid_time` while ensuring no passenger has already taken that time and you can still catch the bus.
4. **Find Latest Time**:
   - After processing all buses, start from the `last_valid_time` and move backward to find the latest time that can be chosen, avoiding passenger times.

### Code
```python
def latest_time_to_catch_the_bus(buses, passengers, capacity):
    # Sort both buses and passengers
    buses.sort()
    passengers.sort()
    
    passenger_index = 0
    last_valid_time = 0
    
    for bus in buses:
        curr_capacity = 0
        
        # Fill the current bus with as many passengers as possible
        while (passenger_index < len(passengers) and 
               passengers[passenger_index] <= bus and 
               curr_capacity < capacity):
            last_valid_time = passengers[passenger_index]
            curr_capacity += 1
            passenger_index += 1
        
        # If we still have capacity on the bus, and no passenger arrives at the bus time, 
        # the last valid time could be the time right when the bus leaves.
        if curr_capacity < capacity:
            last_valid_time = bus
    
    # We have the last possible valid time but we need to make sure 
    # it's not one of the passenger's arrival time
    latest_arrival_time = last_valid_time
    while latest_arrival_time in set(passengers):
        latest_arrival_time -= 1
    
    return latest_arrival_time

# Example Usage:
buses = [10, 20]
passengers = [2, 17, 18, 19]
capacity = 2
print(latest_time_to_catch_the_bus(buses, passengers, capacity))  # Output should be 16
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Sorting**: O(N log N) for both `buses` and `passengers`.
2. **Iteration over buses and passengers**: O(N), where N is the number of passengers.
3. **Finding latest time**: O(P), where P is the number of passengers (in the worst case).

- **Overall Time Complexity**: This is O(N log N) due to the sorting operations.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the latest time we can arrive to catch a bus without conflicting with any passenger's arrival time.
