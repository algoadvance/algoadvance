title:  Evaluate Boolean Binary Tree-out
permalink: /s2331
---

You are given the root of a **full binary tree** with the following properties:

- **Leaf nodes** have either the value `0` or `1`, where:
  - `0` represents `False`
  - `1` represents `True`
- **Non-leaf nodes** have either the value `2` or `3`, where:
  - `2` represents the boolean `OR` operation
  - `3` represents the boolean `AND` operation

The value of a node in the boolean tree is calculated recursively. Leaf nodes do not have any children, while non-leaf nodes will have exactly two children, left and right.

Write a function to evaluate the boolean value of the root node, considering the children and the operations as described.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format**: What is the format of the input tree provided?
   - The tree will be given via the `TreeNode` class definition as described in Leetcode.

2. **Output**: What should be the output?
   - The output should be a boolean value `True` or `False` after evaluating the tree.

## Code

```python
# Definition for TreeNode.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def evaluateTree(self, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
        if not root:
            return False
        
        # If the node is a leaf node
        if root.left is None and root.right is None:
            return root.val == 1
        
        left_val = self.evaluateTree(root.left)
        right_val = self.evaluateTree(root.right)
        
        if root.val == 2:
            return left_val or right_val
        
        if root.val == 3:
            return left_val and right_val

# Example Usage:
# Let's build a tree to test the function
# Example Tree: [3,2,1,1]
#      3
#     / \
#    2   1
#   / \
#  1   1

root = TreeNode(3, TreeNode(2, TreeNode(1), TreeNode(1)), TreeNode(1))
sol = Solution()
print(sol.evaluateTree(root))  # Expected output: True
```

## Strategy

1. **Base case for leaf nodes**:
   - If the node is a leaf node (both left and right children are `None`), return whether the node value is `1` (i.e., `True`).

2. **Recursive evaluation**:
   - Recursively evaluate the left and right children.
   - If the current node value is `2`, perform the logical OR operation on the results of the left and right children.
   - If the current node value is `3`, perform the logical AND operation on the results of the left and right children.

3. **Return the result**:
   - The final result of the tree evaluation will be returned.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we need to visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(H)`, where `H` is the height of the tree. This space is used by the recursion stack.
