title:  Kth Smallest Amount With Single Denomination Combination-out
permalink: /s3116
---

You are given an integer `k` and an array `denominations` where each element represents a type of coin with a specific value. Your task is to determine the `k`th smallest amount of money that can be formed using an arbitrary number of coins from the `denominations` array. The coins can be used any number of times, including zero.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: k = 3, denominations = [1, 10, 25]
Output: 3
Explanation: The possible amounts are [1, 2, 3, 4, ...].
The third smallest amount is 3.
```

### Constraints
- The denominations array will have distinct integers.
- The array can contain up to 10^3 elements.
- The values in the array will be less than 10^5.
- The value of `k` is within the valid range of the sums that can be generated with the given denominations.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the denominations contain duplicate values? 
   - No, they are distinct.
2. Can `k` be 1? 
   - Yes, k can be any valid positive integer.
3. Are the denominations sorted?
   - No, not necessarily.
4. Can denominations contain zero or negative values?
   - The problem statement implies all values are positive integers.

## Strategy

1. **Priority Queue (Min-Heap):** 
    - Use a min-heap to continuously fetch the smallest amount formed and generate the next possible amounts by adding each of the denominations.
    - Use a set to keep track of amounts already visited to avoid processing the same amount multiple times.

2. **Algorithm:**
    - Initialize a min-heap with a starting value of 0.
    - Initialize a set to store visited amounts.
    - Extract the smallest amount from the heap `k` times, each time adding new possible amounts formed by adding each denomination to the current smallest amount.
    - Once we have taken the smallest amount `k` times, the current value is our answer.

## Time Complexity
- Extracting an element from the heap takes `O(log n)`.
- We might potentially go through several combinations, but since we only need the k-th smallest, we are more concerned with heap operations.

Let's proceed with the code implementation.

## Code

```python
import heapq

def kth_smallest_amount(k, denominations):
    # Using a min heap to track the smallest amounts
    min_heap = []
    visited = set()
    
    # Insert the initial value of 0 into the heap
    heapq.heappush(min_heap, 0)
    visited.add(0)
    
    current_amount = 0
    
    for _ in range(k):
        # Pop the smallest amount
        current_amount = heapq.heappop(min_heap)
        
        # Generate and push new amounts by adding each denomination
        for denom in denominations:
            new_amount = current_amount + denom
            if new_amount not in visited:
                visited.add(new_amount)
                heapq.heappush(min_heap, new_amount)
    
    return current_amount

# Example usage
k = 3
denominations = [1, 10, 25]
print(kth_smallest_amount(k, denominations)) # Output: 3
```

This code uses a min-heap to maintain the smallest possible sum at every step and efficiently retrieves the `k`th smallest amount by repeating the process `k` times.
