title:  Number of Sub-arrays of Size K and Average Greater than or Equal to Threshold-out
permalink: /s1343
---

Given an array of integers `arr` and two integers `k` and `threshold`, return the number of subarrays of size `k` and average greater than or equal to `threshold`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Clarifications:**
    - Can `arr` contain negative numbers?
    - What is the allowed range for `k` and `threshold`?
2. **Output Clarifications:**
    - Should the function return an integer representing the count of subarrays?

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
    - Calculate the target sum as `k * threshold`.

2. **Sliding Window Method:**
    - Use a sliding window approach to find subarrays of size `k`.
    - Calculate the sum of the initial window.
    - Slide the window across the array and adjust the sum by subtracting the element that is left out of the window and adding the new element.
    - Count the windows where the sum is greater than or equal to the target sum.

3. **Edge Cases:**
    - If `k` is larger than the length of the array, immediately return 0.
    - If there are negative numbers, ensure the logic holds for calculating the average.

### Code

```python
def numOfSubarrays(arr, k, threshold):
    if len(arr) < k:
        return 0
    
    target_sum = k * threshold
    current_sum = sum(arr[:k])
    count = 0
    
    if current_sum >= target_sum:
        count += 1
    
    for i in range(k, len(arr)):
        current_sum += arr[i] - arr[i - k]
        if current_sum >= target_sum:
            count += 1
    
    return count
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**
    - The initial window sum calculation takes `O(k)`.
    - Sliding the window across the array takes `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of `arr`.
    - Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.

- **Space Complexity:**
    - The space complexity is `O(1)` as we are only using a fixed amount of extra space for variables.

This solution ensures we efficiently count the number of subarrays of size `k` with an average greater than or equal to the given `threshold` using a sliding window technique.
