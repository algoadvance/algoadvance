title:  Reaching Points-out
permalink: /s780
---
Given four integers `sx`, `sy`, `tx`, and `ty`, return `true` if it is possible to reach the point `(tx, ty)` from `(sx, sy)` by repeatedly performing the following operation:

- If `sx < tx`, then `sx = sx + sy`.
- If `sy < ty`, then `sy = sy + sx`.

Otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `sx` and `sy` be equal to `tx` and `ty` initially?**
    - Yes, if `sx == tx` and `sy == ty` initially, we should return `true`.
2. **Are `sx`, `sy`, `tx`, and `ty` guaranteed to be positive integers?**
    - Yes, the problem guarantees that all inputs are positive integers.
3. **Are there any constraints on the size of `sx`, `sy`, `tx`, and `ty`?**
    - There are no explicit constraints on the sizes provided in the problem, but they should be within the typical range of integer values for computational feasibility.

### Strategy
The operations `sx = sx + sy` and `sy = sy + sx` give us insight into the problem. Rather than trying to reach `(tx, ty)` from `(sx, sy)` by addition, we can think about the problem in reverse by subtracting:

- If `tx > ty` then the previous state would have been `(tx - ty, ty)` instead of `(tx, ty)`.
- If `ty > tx` then the previous state would have been `(tx, ty - tx)` instead of `(tx, ty)`.

We continue this process until one of the following conditions is met:
1. `(sx == tx and sy == ty)`: If we meet the initial points, return `true`.
2. `(tx < sx or ty < sy)`: If target points go below the initial points, return `false`.

### Code

```python
def reachingPoints(sx: int, sy: int, tx: int, ty: int) -> bool:
    while tx >= sx and ty >= sy:
        if tx == sx and ty == sy:
            return True
        if tx > ty:
            if ty > sy:
                tx %= ty
            else:
                return (tx - sx) % ty == 0
        else:
            if tx > sx:
                ty %= tx
            else:
                return (ty - sy) % tx == 0
    return False
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach can be roughly considered as `O(log(max(tx, ty)))`:

- The modulo operation `%` effectively reduces `tx` or `ty` towards `sx` or `sy` by large steps.
- Each operation brings `tx` or `ty` significantly closer to `sx` or `sy`, akin to a logarithmic reduction, thus making the algorithm efficient for large values.

This approach ensures that the problem is solved efficiently with minimal redundant calculations.
