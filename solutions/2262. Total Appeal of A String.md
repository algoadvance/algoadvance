title:  Total Appeal of A String-out
permalink: /s2262

Given a string s, return the total appeal of all of its substrings.

The appeal of a string is defined as the number of distinct characters found in the string. For example, the appeal of "abbca" is 3 because it has 3 distinct characters: 'a', 'b', and 'c'.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: What are the constraints on the input string `s` (length, characters)?
   - **Constraints**: The length of `s` is in the range [1, 10^5]. `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

2. **Output**: Are we supposed to return the appeal of all substrings summed together?
   - **Yes, the task is to sum up the appeal of every possible substring of `s`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - A single character string should return 1.
   - All characters being same: the appeal value of each substring would be 1.

## Strategy

### Brute Force Approach

1. **Generate all substrings**: Generate all possible substrings of the given string `s`.
2. **Calculate distinct characters**: For each substring, calculate the number of distinct characters.
3. **Sum the appeals**: Sum up the appeal values for all substrings.

However, this brute force approach is not feasible due to O(N^3) time complexity, given the constraints.

### Optimized Approach

1. **Use a running total array**: Maintain an array `last_pos` to keep track of the last position seen for each character.
2. **Calculate Contribution**: As we iterate over the string, for each character `s[i]` at index `i`, calculate its contribution to the appeal of all substrings ending at `i`:
   - For character `s[i]`, count the substrings that include it and donâ€™t include its previous occurrence.
   - Sum up influences, update `last_pos`, and maintain a running total of the sum of appeals.

### Time Complexity

We will achieve an O(N) solution by iterating through the string only once.

## Code

```python
def total_appeal(s: str) -> int:
    last_pos = [-1] * 26
    total_appeal = 0
    current_appeal = 0
    
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        idx = ord(char) - ord('a')
        
        current_appeal += (i - last_pos[idx])
        total_appeal += current_appeal
        
        last_pos[idx] = i
    
    return total_appeal

# Test the function with an example input
print(total_appeal("abbca")) # Output: 28
```

## Explanation

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `last_pos` is a list of size 26 (for each lowercase letter), initialized to -1.
   - `total_appeal` keeps track of the total appeal of all substrings.
   - `current_appeal` keeps track of appeal values as we iterate.

2. **Iteration**:
   - For each character `s[i]`, determine its index `idx` in `last_pos`.
   - Update `current_appeal` by counting new substrings `s[k:i+1]` where `k = last_pos[idx] + 1`.
   - Add `current_appeal` to `total_appeal`.
   - Update `last_pos` for the current character.

This approach ensures a linear pass through `s` while leveraging the last seen positions for constant-time calculations.
