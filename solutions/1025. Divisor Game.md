**1025. Divisor Game**

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there is a number `N` on the chalkboard. On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:

1. Choosing any `x` with `0 < x < N` and `N % x == 0`.
2. Replacing the number `N` on the chalkboard with `N - x`.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.

Return `true` if and only if Alice wins the game, assuming both players play optimally.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Clarification on `N`**: 
    - Can `N` be any positive integer within a specific range?
        - Yes, `N` is a positive integer, and the constraints generally imply `1 <= N <= 1000`.

2. **Game Rules**:
    - For every move, a player reduces `N` by some divisor of `N` less than `N` itself?
        - Correct.

### Strategy

The game exhibits a pattern based on whether `N` is even or odd.

- If `N` is even, Alice can force a win by playing optimally.
- If `N` is odd, Alice cannot force a win if Bob also plays optimally.

**Reasoning**:
1. If `N = 1`, Alice loses because she cannot make any valid moves.
2. If `N = 2`, Alice wins by subtracting 1 (the only valid move).
3. If `N = 3`, Alice loses because she subtracts 1, making it `N = 2` for Bob's turn, and Bob will win.
4. If `N = 4`, Alice can subtract 1, leaving `N = 3` for Bob's turn. Bob loses at `N = 3`, so Alice wins.

From this, we observe that:
- For even `N`, the opponent always faces an odd `N` after Aliceâ€™s turn.
- For odd `N`, Alice faces an even `N` on the opponent's turn after subtracting an odd divisor less than `N`.

This pattern holds up through larger values of `N`.

### Code

```python
def divisorGame(N: int) -> bool:
    return N % 2 == 0
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(1)` (constant time) since it only involves determining whether `N` is even or odd, which is a single operation. No iterations or recursive calls are required.

### Explanation

1. If `N` is even, `N % 2 == 0` returns `True`, and Alice wins.
2. If `N` is odd, `N % 2 != 0` returns `False`, and Alice loses.

This optimal strategy is derived from patterns observed through mathematical reasoning and ensures both players are playing optimally.
