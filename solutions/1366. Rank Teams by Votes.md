title:  Rank Teams by Votes-out
permalink: /s1366
---

In a special ranking system, each voter gives a rank from highest to lowest to all teams participated in the competition. The ordering of teams is decided by who received the most position-one votes. If two or more teams tie in the first position, we consider the second position to resolve the conflict, and so on. 

You are given an array of strings `votes` which is the votes of all voters in the ranking systems. Sort all teams according to the ranking system described above.

Return a string of all teams sorted by the ranking system.

### Example:
#### Input:
```python
votes = ["ABC","ACB","ABC","ACB","ACB"]
```
#### Output:
```python
"ACB"
```

### Constraints:
1. `1 <= votes.length <= 1000`
2. `1 <= votes[i].length <= 26`
3. `votes[i].length == votes[j].length` for `0 <= i, j < votes.length`
4. `votes[i][j]` is an uppercase English letter.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are there any ties possible, and if so, how are they resolved?
   - We resolve ties by looking at subsequent positions as stated.
2. Is the input always valid (i.e., each string in `votes` contains a unique permutation of teams)?
   - Yes, we assume all inputs are valid and consistent with the constraints.

## Strategy
1. Initialize a dictionary to count the votes for each position for each team.
2. Process each vote to update the count dictionary.
3. Sort the teams based on the counted votes for each position.
4. Convert the sorted result to a string and return it.

The steps in detail:
- Use a dictionary where the key is the team and the value is a list of counts of its positions.
- Iterate over each vote and update the positions' counts for each team.
- Create a sorted list of teams based on their counts, resolving ties by lexicographical order if necessary.
- Convert the sorted list to a string and return that string.

## Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def rankTeams(votes):
    if not votes:
        return ""
    
    # Initialize the vote count dictionary
    length = len(votes[0])
    vote_counts = defaultdict(lambda: [0] * length)
    
    # Count the votes
    for vote in votes:
        for i, team in enumerate(vote):
            vote_counts[team][i] += 1
    
    # Sort the teams
    sorted_teams = sorted(vote_counts.keys(), key=lambda team: (vote_counts[team], -ord(team)), reverse=True)
    
    # Return the sorted teams as a single string
    return ''.join(sorted_teams)
```

## Time Complexity
- **Counting Votes:** O(N * M) where N is the number of votes and M is the length of each vote string.
- **Sorting Teams:** O(T log T) where T is the number of teams (at most 26).
- **Total Complexity:** O(N * M + T log T) which is efficient for the given constraints (N, M ≤ 1000 and T ≤ 26).

The solution should efficiently handle the given constraints and return the correct ranking string for the teams based on the votes.
