The problem "818. Race Car" from LeetCode is as follows:

Your car starts at position 0 and speed +1 on an infinite number line. Your car can go into two possible states:
- "A": Accelerate, which increments your position by the speed of the car, and doubles the speed (i.e., position += speed, speed *= 2).
- "R": Reverse, which reverses the direction of your car, so the speed becomes the negated speed of the car (i.e., speed = -speed).

Given a target position, return the length of the shortest sequence of instructions to get there.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the target position?**
   - The target position is 1 ≤ target ≤ 10000.

2. **Can the car move into negative positions?**
   - Yes, the car can move into negative positions, but the goal is to reach the target position.

3. **Do we need to return the actual sequence of instructions?**
   - No, only the length of the shortest sequence.

### Strategy
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: We model the problem as a graph traversal problem where each state of the car (position, speed) represents a node in the graph. BFS is suitable because we are looking for the shortest path to the target.

2. **Set for Visited States**: To keep track of visited states and avoid processing the same state multiple times.

3. **Queue for BFS**: Each element in the queue represents the current state `(position, speed)` and the number of instructions taken to reach this state.

### Code
```python
import collections

def racecar(target):
    # BFS queue - (position, speed, steps)
    queue = collections.deque([(0, 1, 0)])
    # Visited set to keep track of visited states to prevent reprocessing
    visited = set([(0, 1)])
    
    while queue:
        position, speed, steps = queue.popleft()
        
        # Check if we've reached the target position
        if position == target:
            return steps
        
        # Consider the next state if we accelerate
        next_position, next_speed = position + speed, speed * 2
        if (next_position, next_speed) not in visited and 0 < next_position < 2 * target:
            visited.add((next_position, next_speed))
            queue.append((next_position, next_speed, steps + 1))
        
        # Consider the next state if we reverse
        reverse_speed = -1 if speed > 0 else 1
        if (position, reverse_speed) not in visited:
            visited.add((position, reverse_speed))
            queue.append((position, reverse_speed, steps + 1))

# Example Usage:
print(racecar(3))  # Output: 2
print(racecar(6))  # Output: 5
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(T * log T)`, where `T` is the target. This is due to the potentially exponential number of states considering speed doubling, but limited by the checks on valid ranges.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(T * log T)`, which arises from storing the visited states and maintaining the BFS queue.

This approach effectively uses BFS to ensure the shortest path is found and employs a set to avoid revisiting states, optimizing the search process.
