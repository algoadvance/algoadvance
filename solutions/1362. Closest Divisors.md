title:  Closest Divisors-out
permalink: /s1362
---
You are given an integer `num` and you need to find the closest two divisors such that either of `num + 1` or `num + 2` can be expressed as the product of these two integers. If there are multiple pairs with the same closest distance, return the pair whose smaller value is the smallest.

**Example:**

```
Input: num = 8
Output: [3, 3]
Explanation: For num + 1 = 9, the divisors are 3 and 3.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the input always guaranteed to be a positive integer?**
   - Yes, as per the problem description.

2. **Do we have any constraints on the size of the input number?**
   - The constraints are generally according to the accepted range of integers in Python, which can handle large values gracefully.

3. **What should be returned if there are multiple pairs with the same distance?**
   - Return the pair whose smaller value is the smallest.

## Strategy

To solve the problem, we need to find divisors of `num + 1` and `num + 2` and return the pair that is closest to each other. Here's the detailed strategy:
1. Compute `num + 1` and `num + 2`.
2. For each of these values, find the pair of divisors whose product equals the number.
3. We optimize this by searching for divisors from the square root of the number down to 1 because it minimizes the distance between possible pairs. The closer the divisor is to the square root, the smaller the distance between the pair.
4. While iterating, track the closest pair of divisors found.
5. Return the pair whose product is closest to each other.

## Code

Here's how we can implement this in Python:

```python
def closestDivisors(num):
    def find_closest_pair(target):
        import math
        for i in range(int(math.sqrt(target)), 0, -1):
            if target % i == 0:
                # i and target // i are the pair
                return (i, target // i)
        return None
    
    num1, num2 = num + 1, num + 2
    pair1 = find_closest_pair(num1)
    pair2 = find_closest_pair(num2)
    
    if abs(pair1[0] - pair1[1]) < abs(pair2[0] - pair2[1]):
        return pair1
    else:
        return pair2

# Example usage
print(closestDivisors(8))  # Output: [3, 3]
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is:
- The `find_closest_pair` function runs in O(√n) because it iterates from √n to 1 to find a divisor.
- Since we call this function twice (for `num + 1` and `num + 2`), the overall time complexity remains O(√n).

This is efficient given the problem constraints and ensures that we get the desired result quickly.
