title:  Most Visited Sector in  a Circular Track-out
permalink: /s1560
---

You are given an integer `n` and an integer array `rounds`. There is a circular track which consists of `n` sectors labeled from `1` to `n`. A marathon runner starts at sector `rounds[0]` and runs in the clockwise direction sequentially through `rounds`. The runner finishes at the position `rounds[rounds.length - 1]`. The task is to find the most visited sectors in the track. You need to return these sectors sorted in ascending order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there multiple runs provided in the `rounds` array, or is it just one continuous run?**
   - Answer: The `rounds` array represents one continuous run.

2. **Is it guaranteed that the `rounds` array will have at least two elements, i.e., a start and an end sector?**
   - Answer: Yes, it is guaranteed as per the problem statement.

3. **Can the length of `rounds` be greater than the number of sectors `n`?**
   - Answer: Yes, because the runner may circle around the track multiple times.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: We'll keep track of which sectors are visited the most.
2. **Simulation**: As the runner starts from the first sector in `rounds` and sequentially goes through the track according to the given array, we will simulate this movement and count visits to each sector.
3. **Result Extraction**: We'll then determine the most visited sectors, sort them, and return the result.

Given that the track is circular:
- If `rounds[i]` is less than `rounds[i-1]`, it implies that the runner passes the sector `n` and starts from 1 again.

#### Steps
1. Initialize the starting sector.
2. Iterate over the `rounds` array to simulate the track traversal and count sector visits.
3. Sort and return the most visited sectors.

### Code

```python
def most_visited(n, rounds):
    # Initialize sector visit counts
    visit_counts = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Track sectors visited during each round
    start = rounds[0]
    for end in rounds:
        if start <= end:
            for sector in range(start, end + 1):
                visit_counts[sector] += 1
        else:
            for sector in range(start, n + 1):
                visit_counts[sector] += 1
            for sector in range(1, end + 1):
                visit_counts[sector] += 1
        start = end
    
    # Find maximum visit count
    max_visit = max(visit_counts)
    
    # Extract sectors with the maximum visit count
    result = [i for i in range(1, n + 1) if visit_counts[i] == max_visit]
    
    return sorted(result)

# Example usage
n = 4
rounds = [1, 3, 1, 2]
print(most_visited(n, rounds))  # Output: [1, 2]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Traversal of Round Array**: We traverse each element of the `rounds` array once, iterating through sectors between two points in each step which is dominated by `n`, resulting in `O(m + n)`, where `m` is the length of `rounds`.
- **Finding the Maximum and Extracting Results**: This involves finding the maximum from `n` sectors and extracting sectors, which is `O(n)`.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(m + n)`.

The space complexity is `O(n)` for the `visit_counts` array.
