title:  Maximum Length of Repeated Subarray-out
permalink: /s718
---

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`. You need to return the maximum length of a subarray that appears in both arrays.

#### Example:
```
Input:
nums1 = [1,2,3,2,1], 
nums2 = [3,2,1,4,7]
Output: 3
Explanation: The repeated subarray with maximum length is [3, 2, 1].
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length of the arrays?**
   - The lengths of the arrays can be up to 1000 elements.

2. **Are the arrays always non-empty?**
   - Yes, you can assume that nums1 and nums2 will always have at least one element.

3. **Can the elements be negative or non-integer?**
   - The elements will always be integers and could be negative as well.

### Strategy

The problem of finding the maximum length of a subarray that appears in both arrays can be efficiently solved using dynamic programming (DP).

#### Dynamic Programming Approach:

1. **Create a DP table**:
   - Let `dp[i][j]` represent the length of the longest common subarray ending at `nums1[i-1]` and `nums2[j-1]`.
   - A table `dp` of size `(len(nums1) + 1) x (len(nums2) + 1)` will be used where `dp[0][*]` and `dp[*][0]` are initialized to 0.

2. **Update the DP table**:
   - For each pair `(i, j)`, if `nums1[i-1] == nums2[j-1]`, set `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`.
   - Otherwise, set `dp[i][j] = 0` because the subarrays ending at those points do not match.

3. **Track the maximum length**:
   - During the process, keep track of the maximum value found in `dp[i][j]`.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is `O(m * n)` where `m` is the length of `nums1` and `n` is the length of `nums2`.
- The space complexity is also `O(m * n)` for the DP table.

### Code

```python
def findLength(nums1, nums2):
    m, n = len(nums1), len(nums2)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    max_len = 0
    
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if nums1[i - 1] == nums2[j - 1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1
                max_len = max(max_len, dp[i][j])
    
    return max_len

# Example usage:
nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]
nums2 = [3, 2, 1, 4, 7]
print(findLength(nums1, nums2))  # Output: 3
```

This solution fills out the DP table based on the rules and efficiently keeps track of the maximum length of the repeated subarray.
