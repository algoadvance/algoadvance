title:  Dinner Plate Stacks-out

### Problem Statement
Design a system that manages dinner plates using multiple stacks. Implement the `DinnerPlates` class:

* `DinnerPlates(int capacity)` stacks should have a maximum capacity of `capacity`.
* `void push(int val)` pushes the given integer `val` onto the leftmost stack with room for another element.
* `int pop()` returns the value at the top of the rightmost non-empty stack and removes it from that stack. If all stacks are empty, return -1.
* `int popAtStack(int index)` returns the value at the top of the stack with the given index and removes it from that stack. If the stack with the given index is empty, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Capacity Constraints**: What are the expected ranges for the number of plates or stacks?
2. **Edge Cases**: Should we handle operations for indexes that are out of range?
3. **Performance**: Any specific performance constraints or target time complexity for pop and push operations?

### Strategy
To implement this system, our approach should involve a list of stacks with the following logic:

1. **Push Method**:
   - Find the leftmost stack with available space.
   - If all the stacks are full, create a new stack.
   - Use a heap to track the leftmost available stack with space for improved efficiency.

2. **Pop Method**:
   - Identify the rightmost non-empty stack for the pop operation.
   - If that stack becomes empty after the pop, we need to remove it from our list or mark it accordingly.

3. **PopAtStack**:
   - Directly access the stack by index and perform the pop operation.
   - We need to handle the case where the stack is already empty.

### Code
Below is the python implementation of the `DinnerPlates` class:

```python
import heapq

class DinnerPlates:

    def __init__(self, capacity: int):
        self.capacity = capacity
        self.stacks = []
        self.available = []  # Min-Heap to track available stacks

    def push(self, val: int) -> None:
        # Remove all invalid (full) indexes from heap
        while self.available and self.available[0] < len(self.stacks) and len(self.stacks[self.available[0]]) == self.capacity:
            heapq.heappop(self.available)
        
        if not self.available:
            heapq.heappush(self.available, len(self.stacks))
            self.stacks.append([])

        # Push to the leftmost available stack
        idx = heapq.heappop(self.available)
        self.stacks[idx].append(val)
        # If the stack has space after push, put it back to the heap
        if len(self.stacks[idx]) < self.capacity:
            heapq.heappush(self.available, idx)

    def pop(self) -> int:
        while self.stacks and not self.stacks[-1]:
            self.stacks.pop()

        if not self.stacks:
            return -1

        return self.stacks[-1].pop()

    def popAtStack(self, index: int) -> int:
        if index < 0 or index >= len(self.stacks) or not self.stacks[index]:
            return -1
        
        result = self.stacks[index].pop()
        heapq.heappush(self.available, index)
        return result
```

### Time Complexity
- **Push Operation**: O(log n) due to heap operations.
- **Pop Operation**: O(m) where `m` is the number of stacks, in the worst case, we may need to check and remove empty stacks.
- **PopAtStack**: O(log n) for heap operation to re-add the stack index.

This provides an efficient system to manage multiple stacks with specific operations. If you have any specific edge cases or constraints, do let me know!
