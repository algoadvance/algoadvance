title:  Minimum Insertions to Balance a Parentheses String-out
permalink: /s1541
---
Given a parentheses string `s` containing only the characters `'('` and `')'`, you may insert parentheses at any position of the string to balance it. A balanced parentheses string is defined as:
1. An empty string is balanced.
2. A string like `"(( ... ))"` where every `'('` has a matching `')'` is balanced.
3. A string `s` is balanced if `A+B` is balanced where both `A` and `B` are balanced strings.

Balanced parentheses string can have uneven pairs of opening and closing, but every `')'` after an opening `'('` completes the element as long as there are no loose parentheses.

Return the minimum number of insertions to make the string balanced.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Is there any restriction on the length of the string `s`?
   - No particular restriction, assume it can be any reasonable length within usual constraints for coding problems.
2. Can `s` be empty?
   - Yes, if `s` is empty, it is trivially balanced, needing `0` insertions.

### Strategy
1. We need to ensure that there are enough closing parentheses `')'` for every opening parenthesis `'('`.
2. We can traverse the string and keep track of any unbalanced parentheses.
3. Since an individual `')'` can be inserted for balance, it may need a single insertion (`(` missing a `)`), ignore when closed pair as `))` are counted correctly to make sure all are balanced.

**Steps**:
1. Initialize counters `open_needed` for unbalanced opening parentheses and `insertions` for the number of insertions required.
2. Iterate over the string `s`:
   - If encountering `'('`, increment `open_needed`.
   - If encountering `')'`:
     - Check if it balances an existing `'('` by checking `open_needed`. If it doesn't find (`pairing issue`), increment necessary `insertions`.
3. By the end, we must also balance any outstanding `open_needed`.

### Plan
- Traverse the string to match parentheses.
- Count necessary insertions while iterating.
- Ensure all `open_needed` are properly balanced.

### Code
```python
def minInsertions(s: str) -> int:
    open_needed = 0
    insertions = 0

    i = 0
    while i < len(s):
        if s[i] == '(':
            open_needed += 1
        elif s[i] == ')':
            if i + 1 < len(s) and s[i + 1] == ')':
                i += 1  # This counts for the double `))` encountered
                if open_needed > 0:
                    open_needed -= 1
                else:
                    insertions += 1  # handle no previous ( for this pair of ))
            else:
                if open_needed > 0:
                    open_needed -= 1
                    insertions += 1  # need an additional ) to balance current solo )
                else:
                    insertions += 2  # need two insertions, one to balance ) and one more )
        i += 1
    insertions += open_needed * 2
    return insertions

# Example
print(minInsertions("())")) # Output: 1
print(minInsertions("(((")) # Output: 6
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string, as we only need a single pass to determine the required insertions.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as we are using a fixed amount of extra space irrespective of the input size.
