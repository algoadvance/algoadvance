title:  Find the Count of Monotonic Pairs II-out
permalink: /s3251
---

You are given an array `arr` consisting of `n` integers, and an integer `k`. A monotonic pair is a pair `(i, j)` such that `1 ≤ i < j ≤ n` and `(arr[j] - arr[i]) ≤ k`. Your task is to write a function to count the number of monotonic pairs in the array.

#### Example:
```python
arr = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]
k = 2
```
Output: `7`

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What are the constraints on the size of the array `n`?
    - What is the range for the elements in the array?
    - Is `k` guaranteed to be a non-negative integer?

2. **Output**:
    - Should the function return the count of monotonic pairs as an integer?
    - Is there a specific format or requirement for the output?

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - How should the function handle arrays with less than 2 elements?
    - Do we need to handle arrays with all elements being the same?

Based on common practices and typical problems, the answers to the clarifying questions might be:
- The size of the array `n` could be in the range `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`.
- The elements in the array could range from `-10^9` to `10^9`.
- `k` is a non-negative integer (`0 ≤ k ≤ 10^9`).
- The function should return the count of monotonic pairs as an integer.
- Arrays with less than 2 elements should return a count of `0`.

### Strategy:

To solve this problem efficiently, given the constraints, we need to consider an approach better than brute force, which would be `O(n^2)` in the worst case. A more efficient method would be beneficial, possibly `O(n log n)`.

#### Approach:

1. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
    - First, sort `arr` along with the original indices to keep track of valid pairs.
    - Use two pointers to iterate through the array and count valid pairs.

### Code:

```python
def count_monotonic_pairs(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    if n < 2:
        return 0

    # Create a list of tuples - (value, original_index)
    indexed_arr = sorted((value, i) for i, value in enumerate(arr))
    
    count = 0
    j = 1
    
    # Iterate with two-pointers
    for i in range(n):
        while j < n and (indexed_arr[j][0] - indexed_arr[i][0]) <= k:
            if indexed_arr[j][1] > indexed_arr[i][1]:
                j += 1
            else:
                break
        count += (j - i - 1)
        
    return count

# Test example
arr = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]
k = 2
print(count_monotonic_pairs(arr, k))  # Output: 7
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Sorting** the array: `O(n log n)`
- **Two-pointer pass**: `O(n)`
- The overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.

### Explanation:

The code sorts the array while maintaining the original indices. Using two pointers `i` and `j`, it counts valid pairs by ensuring `(arr[j] - arr[i]) <= k` and `i < j`. This method ensures optimal performance for larger input sizes, avoiding the `O(n^2)` complexity of a naive approach.
