title:  Smallest String Starting From Leaf-out
permalink: /s988
---

Given the root of a binary tree, each node has a value from `0` to `25` representing the letters 'a' to 'z': a value of `0` represents 'a', a value of `1` represents 'b', and so on.

Find the lexicographically smallest string that starts at a leaf of this tree and ends at the root.

### Example
```
Input: root = [0,1,2,3,4,3,4]
Output: "dba"
Explanation:
The leaf to root paths are:
- 3->1->0: "dba"
- 4->1->0: "eba"
- 3->2->0: "dca"
- 4->2->0: "eca"
The lexicographically smallest string starting at a leaf is "dba".
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the size of the tree?**
   - This helps to understand the constraints and optimize the solution.
   
2. **Can there be null nodes?**
   - To confirm if nodes can have null values and how to handle them.

3. **Should we consider only leaf nodes?**
   - Yes, we consider paths that start from leaf nodes only.

### Strategy

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS):**
   - We'll use DFS to traverse the tree since we need to explore the nodes to their depth (i.e., leaf nodes).

2. **Character Conversion:**
   - Given a node value, convert it to the corresponding character by using `chr(node.val + ord('a'))`.

3. **Track Paths:**
   - As we apply DFS, keep track of the string forming from the current node to the root.

4. **Lexicographical Comparison:**
   - Compare strings formed from different leaf nodes and keep the lexicographically smallest one.

### Code

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class Solution:
    def smallestFromLeaf(self, root: TreeNode) -> str:
        def dfs(node, path):
            if node is None:
                return
            # Convert current node value to character and prepend to path
            path = chr(node.val + ord('a')) + path
            if node.left is None and node.right is None:
                # At leaf node, check if it's the smallest path
                smallest_paths.append(path)
            else:
                dfs(node.left, path)
                dfs(node.right, path)
        
        smallest_paths = []
        dfs(root, "")
        return min(smallest_paths)

# Example Usage
# Define the tree [0,1,2,3,4,3,4]
root = TreeNode(0)
root.left = TreeNode(1)
root.right = TreeNode(2)
root.left.left = TreeNode(3)
root.left.right = TreeNode(4)
root.right.left = TreeNode(3)
root.right.right = TreeNode(4)

sol = Solution()
print(sol.smallestFromLeaf(root))  # Output: "dba"
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Since we traverse all nodes in the tree once, the time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is also `O(n)` due to the recursive stack used in the depth-first traversal and the storage for `smallest_paths`.

This solution ensures we effectively find the smallest string from any leaf to the root by converting and comparing paths lexicographically.
