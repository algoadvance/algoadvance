title:  Maximum Difference by Remapping a Digit-out
permalink: /s2566
---

You are given an integer `num`. The `num` is represented in the form of a string. Your task is to find the maximum possible difference you can get by changing one single digit of `num` to any other digit (0-9). You must ensure the number remains valid after the change (i.e., it must not have any leading zeros unless the number itself is zero).

### Clarifying Questions

1. Should the result be always a positive difference?
   - Yes, you're aiming to maximize the absolute difference between the original and the modified number.

2. Is `num` guaranteed to not have leading zeros (except for when `num` itself is zero)?
   - Yes, except for the case where `num` itself is zero.

3. What should be returned if `num` itself is zero?
   - If `num` is zero, then any remapping would lead to the same result as no other number is smaller than zero but zero itself; hence the maximum difference will be zero.

4. Can the number be negative?
   - No, the problem constraints indicate that `num` is always a positive integer.

### Strategy

1. **Identify the Maximum and Minimum Possible Numbers:**
   - To maximize the difference, we should look at changing the digits in two ways:
     1. Change any digit to 9.
     2. Change any digit to 0 or 1 (depending on its position).
 
2. **Generate Potential Numbers:**
   - For the highest possible value:
     - Find the first non-9 digit and change all identical digits to 9.
    
   - For the lowest possible value:
     - If the first digit is not already 1, change the first digit to 1.
     - Otherwise, find the first non-0, non-1 digit and change all identical digits to 0.

3. **Compute the Difference:**
   - Compute the difference between the modified values and return the maximum difference.

### Code

```python
def maxDifferenceByRemappingDigit(num: str) -> int:
    # Calculate highest possible number by changing some digit to 9
    highest_num = list(num)
    for i in range(len(num)):
        if num[i] != '9':
            high_digit = num[i]
            break
    highest_num = "".join(['9' if x == high_digit else x for x in num])
    
    # Calculate lowest possible number by changing some digit to 0 or 1
    lowest_num = list(num)
    if num[0] != '1':
        for i in range(len(num)):
            if num[i] != '1':
                low_digit = num[i]
                break
        lowest_num = num[0] + "".join(['0' if x == low_digit else x for x in num[1:]])
    else:
        for i in range(1, len(num)):
            if num[i] != '0' and num[i] != '1':
                low_digit = num[i]
                break
        lowest_num = "".join(['0' if x == low_digit else x for x in num])
        
    # Convert strings back to integers
    highest_num = int(highest_num)
    lowest_num = int(lowest_num)

    # Return the maximum difference
    return highest_num - lowest_num

# Example usage:
num = "123456"
print(maxDifferenceByRemappingDigit(num))  # Output will be the maximum difference
```

### Time Complexity

- **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the number string. The primary operations such as finding the first non-9 digit and replacing digits in the string take linear time relative to the number of digits.
