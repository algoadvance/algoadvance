title:  Subarray Product Less Than K-out
permalink: /s713
---
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is strictly less than `k`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be returned if no subarrays meet the requirement?**
   - Return `0`.
2. **Can the elements in `nums` be negative or zero?**
   - The elements will be positive integers as products involving zero or negative numbers can significantly complicate the problem constraints.
3. **What is the length range of the `nums` array?**
   - The length of `nums` can vary, but typically it can be assumed to be reasonably large (e.g., up to \(10^4\)).
4. **What should we return if `k` is less than or equal to 1?**
   - If `k` is less than or equal to 1, it's impossible to have any product less than `k` since all elements are positive integers. Thus, return `0`.

### Strategy
1. **Sliding Window Technique:**
   - We will use a two-pointer approach to maintain a sliding window and expand or shrink this window to satisfy the condition of the product being less than `k`.
   - Initialize two pointers, `start` and `end`, both at the beginning of the array.
   - Maintain a variable `prod` to keep track of the product of elements in the current window.
   - Iterate `end` from `0` to the end of the array:
     - Multiply `prod` by the value at `nums[end]`.
     - If `prod` becomes greater than or equal to `k`, increment `start` until `prod` is less than `k`, adjusting `prod` accordingly.
   - Count the number of valid subarrays that end at position `end` by adding `(end - start + 1)` to the result.

### Code
```python
def numSubarrayProductLessThanK(nums, k):
    if k <= 1:
        return 0
    
    start = 0
    prod = 1
    count = 0
    
    for end in range(len(nums)):
        prod *= nums[end]
        
        while prod >= k and start <= end:
            prod //= nums[start]
            start += 1
        
        count += (end - start + 1)
    
    return count
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of elements in `nums`.
  - In the worst case, each element is processed twice (once by `end` and potentially once by `start`).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

### Conclusion
This solution efficiently counts the number of valid subarrays with a product less than `k` using a sliding window approach. The algorithm runs in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes.
