title:  Special Array II-out
permalink: /s3152

You are given a non-negative integer array `nums`. A special array is a permutation of `nums` such that there are `k` integers greater than or equal to `k` in the array, for all valid values of `k`. How many permutations of `nums` can form a special array?

For example, if `nums = [0, 4, 3, 0, 4]`, the possible permutations that can form a special array are `[0, 4, 4]`, `[4, 4, 3]`, `[3, 4, 4]`. Each of these arrays has a property that there are `k` integers that are greater than or equal to `k` in the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input size and constraints:**
   - What is the size range of `nums`?
   - Will there be any negative integers in the array?
   
2. **Output Specification:** 
   - Should the function return the count of valid permutations?

### Given
Let's assume:
- The length of `nums` is up to 1000.
- `nums` contains non-negative integers.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the array:**
   - It's simpler to analyze the array in sorted order, as we can easily count values greater than or equal to any integer.
   
2. **Binary Search for the Valid k:**
   - We can use binary search to find the value of `k` that satisfies the special array property. This is because for a given k, we can determine the count of numbers greater than or equal to `k` in logarithmic time.
   
3. **Count Valid Permutations:**
   - Upon determining valid indices for `k`, we use combinatorial mathematics to count permutations.

### Code

Hereâ€™s the implementation:

```python
from itertools import permutations

def numSpecialArrayPerm(nums):
    nums.sort()

    def count_geq_k(k):
        # Find the number of elements >= k using binary search
        l, r = 0, len(nums) - 1
        while l <= r:
            mid = l + (r - l) // 2
            if nums[mid] >= k:
                r = mid - 1
            else:
                l = mid + 1
        return len(nums) - l

    res = []
    for k in range(1, len(nums) + 1):
        if count_geq_k(k) == k:
            res.append(k)

    # Now calculate the permutations
    if not res:
        return 0

    # Generating the permutations and counting the valid ones
    permuted = permutations(nums)
    count = 0

    for perm in permuted:
        valid = True
        for val in res:
            if sum(1 for x in perm if x >= val) != val:
                valid = False
                break
        if valid:
            count += 1

    return count

# Test Cases
print(numSpecialArrayPerm([0, 4, 3, 0, 4]))  # Example test case
print(numSpecialArrayPerm([1, 2, 2, 3]))  # Additional test cases
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting the Array:** O(n log n)
- **Binary Search for Each k:** O(log n) for each k
- **Counting Permutations:** O(n!), which makes this approach feasible for small `n`

Be mindful that the factorial of a number grows exponentially, making it impractical for large lists. For large arrays, an optimization or different strategy will be required to make the problem solvable.
