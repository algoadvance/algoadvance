title:  Longest Arithmetic Subsequence-out
permalink: /s1027

Given an array `nums` of integers, return the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in `nums`.

A sequence of numbers is called an arithmetic sequence if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Input Values:** What are the minimum and maximum possible values for the elements in the array?
2. **Array Length:** What is the minimum and maximum length of the input array?
3. **Negative Elements:** Can the array contain negative integers?

### Code

```python
def longest_arith_seq_length(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0

    n = len(nums)
    dp = [{} for _ in range(n)]
    max_length = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            diff = nums[i] - nums[j]
            if diff in dp[j]:
                dp[i][diff] = dp[j][diff] + 1
            else:
                dp[i][diff] = 2
            max_length = max(max_length, dp[i][diff])
    
    return max_length

# Example usage:
nums = [3, 6, 9, 12]
print(longest_arith_seq_length(nums))  # Output: 4
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Create an array `dp` where each element is a dictionary to store the longest arithmetic subsequence ending at that index with various differences.
2. **Iterate Over Pairs**: For each pair `(i, j)` where `i > j`, compute the difference `diff = nums[i] - nums[j]`.
3. **Update DP Table**: 
   - If this difference `diff` already exists in `dp[j]`, then we can extend that subsequence by including `nums[i]`. So, `dp[i][diff] = dp[j][diff] + 1`.
   - If this difference `diff` does not exist, it means this is the start of a new arithmetic subsequence with two elements, so `dp[i][diff] = 2`.
4. **Track Maximum Length**: Update `max_length` after processing each pair to track the longest arithmetic subsequence found.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2)
  - We are using a nested loop to traverse each pair of elements in the array.
  - For each pair, we are performing constant time operations to update the `dp` table.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n^2)
  - The `dp` array potentially contains dictionaries with up to `n` entries (though typically much less), leading to quadratic space usage in worst-case scenarios.

This solution efficiently finds the longest arithmetic subsequence in a given array while maintaining a manageable time and space complexity for large input sizes.
