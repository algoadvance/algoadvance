title:  Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence-out

 ## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format**:
    - Is the input always a list of integers?
    - Can the list contain negative numbers?
    - What is the minimum and maximum length of the list?
2. **Output Format**:
    - Should the result be a single integer representing the count of the longest increasing subsequences?
3. **Edge Cases**:
    - What should be returned if the list is empty?
    - How do we handle cases where all elements are the same?

Assuming the input is a list of integers with standard constraints (like the length can be up to 2000), we can proceed.

## Strategy
1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
    - Use two arrays, `lengths` and `counts`:
        - `lengths[i]` will store the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with the element at index `i`.
        - `counts[i]` will store the number of LIS that end with the element at index `i`.
    - Initialize both arrays with `1`s because each element by itself is an increasing subsequence of length 1.
2. **Update Arrays**:
    - Iterate through the array. For each element at index `i`, check the elements before it (from index `0` to `i-1`).
    - If `nums[j] < nums[i]`, it means that `nums[i]` can be appended to the increasing subsequence ending at `j`.
        - Update the `lengths` and `counts` arrays accordingly.
3. **Count the LIS**:
    - The length of the longest increasing subsequences is the maximum value in the `lengths` array.
    - To find the number of such subsequences, sum the values in the `counts` array where the corresponding value in `lengths` array is equal to the maximum length.

## Code

```python
def findNumberOfLIS(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    
    n = len(nums)
    lengths = [1] * n
    counts = [1] * n
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[j] < nums[i]:
                if lengths[j] + 1 > lengths[i]:
                    lengths[i] = lengths[j] + 1
                    counts[i] = counts[j]
                elif lengths[j] + 1 == lengths[i]:
                    counts[i] += counts[j]
    
    max_length = max(lengths)
    return sum(c for l, c in zip(lengths, counts) if l == max_length)

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 3, 5, 4, 7]
print(findNumberOfLIS(nums))  # Output: 2
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\) because we have a nested loop: the outer loop iterates over each element, and the inner loop iterates over all previous elements.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) for the `lengths` and `counts` arrays.

This solution efficiently calculates and counts the longest increasing subsequences in a given list.
