title:  Max Consecutive Ones III-out
permalink: /s1004
---

You are given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`. A binary array is an array that consists only of `0`s and `1`s. You can flip at most `k` `0`s to `1`s in the array. Return the maximum number of consecutive `1`s in the array that you can get by flipping at most `k` `0`s.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,1,0,0], k = 0
Output: 3
Explanation: [1,1,1,1,1,0,0]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume that the array `nums` and integer `k` will always be provided within valid constraints?
2. Is the output expected to be just the length of the maximum consecutive `1`s or should we also output the modified array?

### Strategy

The problem can be efficiently solved using the sliding window technique. Here's how:

1. **Initialize two pointers** `left` and `right` to the beginning of the array. `left` will signify the start of the window and `right` will signify the end of the window.
2. Traverse the array using the `right` pointer:
   - If `nums[right]` is `0`, increment a count of zeros within the current window.
   - While this count exceeds `k`, increment the `left` pointer to reduce the zeros in the window until the count is `k` or less.
3. At each step, calculate the window length (`right - left + 1`) and track the maximum length encountered.

### Code

```python
def longestOnes(nums, k):
    left = 0
    max_length = 0
    zeros_count = 0
    
    for right in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[right] == 0:
            zeros_count += 1
        
        while zeros_count > k:
            if nums[left] == 0:
                zeros_count -= 1
            left += 1
            
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)
    
    return max_length
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. This is because each element is visited at most twice, once by the `right` pointer and once by the `left` pointer.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), because we are using only a few extra variables and their space requirement does not grow with input size.

This approach handles the problem efficiently, leveraging the sliding window technique to maintain a balance between the maximum consecutive 1's and the allowed flips of 0's.
