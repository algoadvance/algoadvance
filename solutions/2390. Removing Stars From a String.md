**LeetCode 2390: Removing Stars From a String**

You are given a string `s`, which contains stars `'*'`.

In one operation, you can:

- Choose a star in `s`.
- Remove the closest non-star character to its left, as well as remove the star itself.

Return the string after all stars have been removed.

**Example:**

Input: `s = "ab*cd*ef*g"`
Output: `"a"`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Is the input string guaranteed to contain at least one star?
   **A:** The problem statement does not specify, so we should handle the case where there are no stars.

2. **Q:** Can there be consecutive stars, e.g., `"abc**d"`?
   **A:** Yes, the problem does not restrict this, so we must handle multiple stars appropriately.

3. **Q:** What should be returned if all characters are removed?
   **A:** An empty string should be returned.

### Strategy

We can use a stack-based approach to solve this problem efficiently:

1. **Initialize a stack** to keep track of valid characters.
2. **Iterate through the string**:
    - If the character is a `*`, **pop the top of the stack** (removing the closest non-star character).
    - Otherwise, **push the character** onto the stack.
3. At the end of the iteration, the **stack will contain** the final string with all stars and corresponding characters removed.
4. Convert the stack to a string and return it.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`. Each character is pushed onto and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`, as we might have all characters in the stack in the worst-case scenario where there are no stars.

### Code

```python
def removeStars(s: str) -> str:
    stack = []

    for char in s:
        if char == '*':
            if stack:
                stack.pop()  # Remove the closest non-star character
        else:
            stack.append(char)  # Add current character to stack

    # Join the stack elements to form the resultant string
    return ''.join(stack)

# Test the function with the given example
s = "ab*cd*ef*g"
print(removeStars(s))  # Output: "a"
```

This solution correctly handles removing stars and the closest characters to them while maintaining a linear time complexity and space efficiency.
