title:  Maximum Subarray Min-Product-out
permalink: /s1856
---
Given an array of positive integers `nums`, the *min-product* of a subarray is defined as the product of the minimum value in the subarray and the sum of the subarray. Return the maximum *min-product* of any non-empty subarray of `nums`. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

### Example
**Input:**
```python
nums = [1,2,3,2]
```
**Output:**
```python
14
```
**Explanation:**
Subarray `[2, 3, 2]` has min-product `2 * (2 + 3 + 2) = 2 * 7 = 14`, which is the maximum.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are all elements in `nums` positive integers?**
   - Yes, the problem states that `nums` contains positive integers.

2. **Is the array `nums` guaranteed to have at least one element?**
   - Yes, the problem implies non-empty subarrays, so `nums` must be non-empty.

3. **What is the largest possible length of `nums`?**
   - This can affect the efficiency of the solution, so it would be helpful to know the constraints.

### Strategy
1. **Monotonic Stack**:
   - Use a monotonic stack to find the next and previous smaller elements for each element in `nums`. This helps in efficiently determining the range of subarrays where the current element is the minimum.

2. **Prefix Sum Array**:
   - Build a prefix sum array to quickly calculate the sum of elements in any subarray.

3. **Calculate Min-Product**:
   - For each element, use the range derived from the stack and the prefix sum array to calculate the min-product.
   
4. **Keep Track of Maximum Min-Product**:
   - Iterate through each element and update the maximum min-product found.

### Time Complexity
- Constructing the prefix sum array: O(n).
- Monotonic stack operations: O(n) for finding previous and next smaller elements.
- Calculating min-products: O(n).

Overall time complexity: O(n).

### Code

```python
def maxSumMinProduct(nums):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    n = len(nums)
    
    # Construct prefix sum array
    prefix_sums = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sums[i + 1] = prefix_sums[i] + nums[i]
    
    # Monotonic stack to find previous and next smaller elements
    prev_smaller = [-1] * n
    next_smaller = [n] * n
    stack = []
    
    # Find next smaller elements
    for i in range(n):
        while stack and nums[stack[-1]] >= nums[i]:
            next_smaller[stack.pop()] = i
        stack.append(i)
        
    # Clear stack to reuse
    stack.clear()
    
    # Find previous smaller elements
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        while stack and nums[stack[-1]] >= nums[i]:
            prev_smaller[stack.pop()] = i
        stack.append(i)
        
    # Calculate max min-product
    max_min_product = 0
    for i in range(n):
        left = prev_smaller[i] + 1
        right = next_smaller[i] - 1
        subarray_sum = prefix_sums[right + 1] - prefix_sums[left]
        min_product = nums[i] * subarray_sum
        max_min_product = max(max_min_product, min_product)
    
    return max_min_product % MOD

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 2, 3, 2]
print(maxSumMinProduct(nums))  # Output: 14
```

The provided function `maxSumMinProduct` calculates the maximum min-product of any subarray using the strategies discussed. The complexity is efficient for a typical range of `nums` sizes commonly seen in coding problems.
