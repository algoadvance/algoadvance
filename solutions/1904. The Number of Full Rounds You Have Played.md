title:  The Number of Full Rounds You Have Played-out
permalink: /s1904
---
You are given two strings `startTime` and `finishTime` (in the format of `HH:MM`) representing the start and finish times of a game. The game is divided into 15-minute intervals known as "full rounds." Calculate how many full rounds you've played between `startTime` and `finishTime`.

- A full round starts at times like `00:00`, `00:15`, `00:30`, `00:45`, `01:00`, and so on.
- If the game finishes exactly at a full round start time, it does not count as a completed round.
- Assume the `startTime` can be on one day and `finishTime` could be the next day.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the `finishTime` be earlier than `startTime` indicating the game crossed over midnight?
    - **A:** Yes, the game can cross over to the next day.
2. **Q:** Should we count the very first interval if `startTime` falls exactly on a boundary like `00:00`, `00:15`, etc.?
    - **A:** No, start time should not be counted.

### Strategy
1. Parse the time strings `startTime` and `finishTime` into minutes since midnight.
2. Adjust for cases where the `finishTime` occurs on the next day.
3. Compute the first possible full round start after `startTime` and the last possible full round start before `finishTime`.
4. Calculate the number of full rounds between these two times.

### Code
Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
def countFullRounds(startTime: str, endTime: str) -> int:
    def timeToMinutes(t: str) -> int:
        h, m = map(int, t.split(':'))
        return h * 60 + m

    startMinutes = timeToMinutes(startTime)
    endMinutes = timeToMinutes(endTime)
    
    # If endMinutes is less than startMinutes, it means the game ended the next day.
    if endMinutes < startMinutes:
        endMinutes += 24 * 60  # add 24 hours in minutes

    # Find the first full round after startMinutes
    firstFullRoundStart = (startMinutes + 14) // 15 * 15
    
    # Find the last full round before endMinutes
    lastFullRoundStart = endMinutes // 15 * 15
    
    # Calculate the number of full rounds
    if firstFullRoundStart < lastFullRoundStart:
        return (lastFullRoundStart - firstFullRoundStart) // 15
    return 0

# Example usage
print(countFullRounds("21:30", "03:00"))  # Outputs: 22
print(countFullRounds("12:01", "12:44"))  # Outputs: 1
print(countFullRounds("00:00", "23:59"))  # Outputs: 95
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(1) because we are performing a constant number of arithmetic operations and comparisons, independent of the input size.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) for the same reason, as we use a fixed amount of space.
