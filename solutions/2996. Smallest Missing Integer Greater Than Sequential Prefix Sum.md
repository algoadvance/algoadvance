title:  Smallest Missing Integer Greater Than Sequential Prefix Sum-out
permalink: /s2996
---

You are given an array `nums` of length `n` consisting of positive integers. The goal is to find the smallest missing integer greater than the sequential prefix sum of the array.

The "sequential prefix sum" of the array is a new array where each element at index `i` is the sum of all previous elements in `nums` plus the current element `nums[i]`.

For example, the sequential prefix sum of `[1,2,3]` is `[1, 1+2, 1+2+3]` which is `[1, 3, 6]`.

Given this, find the smallest integer greater than the maximum element in this sequential prefix sum array that does not appear in the array `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the given integers always positive?**
    - Yes, the problem statement specifies that the array `nums` consists of positive integers.
    
2. **Should we consider only integers greater than the maximum sequential prefix sum, or all integers?**
    - We are looking for the smallest integer greater than the sequential prefix sum array and which is not present in `nums`.

3. **Is the array sorted?**
    - No, the given array `nums` is not necessarily sorted.

### Strategy

1. **Compute Sequential Prefix Sum:** 
    - Iterate through the `nums` array and compute the sequential prefix sum.
    
2. **Find the Maximum of Prefix Sum:** 
    - Identify the maximum value from the computed prefix sums.
    
3. **Identify the Missing Integer:**
    - Initialize a candidate integer and check if it's present in `nums`. Increment the candidate until we find a missing integer.

### Code

```python
def smallest_missing_integer(nums):
    # Step 1: Compute Sequential Prefix Sum
    seq_prefix_sums = []
    current_sum = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        current_sum += num
        seq_prefix_sums.append(current_sum)
    
    # Step 2: Find the maximum value in the prefix sums
    max_prefix_sum = max(seq_prefix_sums)
    
    # Step 3: Find the smallest missing integer greater than max_prefix_sum
    candidate = max_prefix_sum + 1
    
    while candidate in nums:
        candidate += 1
    
    return candidate

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 2, 3]
print(smallest_missing_integer(nums))  # Output should be the smallest missing integer > 6 not in [1, 2, 3]
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity can be broken down as follows:
1. **Computing Prefix Sums:** This takes O(n) time because we iterate through the `nums` array once.
2. **Finding the Maximum Prefix Sum:** This also takes O(n) time because we iterate through the prefix sums.
3. **Finding the Missing Integer:** In the worst case, this could take O(n) time if the missing integer is a bit greater than the maximum prefix sum but close to any known large gaps in `nums`.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.
