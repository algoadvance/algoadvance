title:  Swap For Longest Repeated Character Substring-out
permalink: /s1156
---
Given a string `text`, we are allowed to swap two characters within the string. Find the length of the longest substring with repeated characters that can be achieved after one swap.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: text = "ababa"
Output: 3

Input: text = "aaabaaa"
Output: 6

Input: text = "aaaaa"
Output: 5

Input: text = "abcdef"
Output: 1
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can `text` be empty?
   - For this problem, let's assume that `text` will have at least one character.
2. Are there any constraints on the characters present in `text`?
   - `text` will consist of lowercase English letters only.

## Strategy
1. **Identify the Character Groups**:
   - Traverse the string to identify groups of the same character.
   - Keep a track of these groups along with their lengths and their start indices.

2. **Determine Possible Swaps**:
   - Evaluate the effect of each possible swap on the length of the longest repeated character substring.
   - Specifically consider merging two groups of the same character separated by one different character, as well as extending the edges of groups by swapping an out-group character in.

3. **Check Merge Potential**:
   - When two groups of the same character are separated by a single different character (i.e., pattern like `aaaXaaa`), check if they can be merged by swapping one character `X`.

4. **Track Maximum Length**:
   - Use a variable to constantly track the maximum length of a repeated character substring obtainable by these swaps.

## Code

```python
def maxRepOpt1(text: str) -> int:
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Step 1: Collect indices for each character
    char_indices = defaultdict(list)
    for index, char in enumerate(text):
        char_indices[char].append(index)
    
    # Step 2: Track the maximum length of repeated characters substring
    max_length = 0
    
    for char, indices in char_indices.items():
        # Step 3: Calculate the initial length of segments of the current character
        n = len(indices)
        count_segment = 1
        segment_lengths = []
        for i in range(1, n):
            if indices[i] == indices[i-1] + 1:
                count_segment += 1
            else:
                segment_lengths.append(count_segment)
                count_segment = 1
        # Append the last counted segment
        segment_lengths.append(count_segment)

        # Step 4: Check the potential max length for current character segments
        m = len(segment_lengths)
        for i in range(m):
            # Without any swap
            max_length = max(max_length, segment_lengths[i])
            
            # Consider swapping if there are more than one indices of this character
            if n > segment_lengths[i]:
                # One swap can extend this segment by one
                max_length = max(max_length, segment_lengths[i] + 1)
            
            # Merge adjacent segments if separated by exactly one character
            if i < m - 1 and indices[sum(segment_lengths[:i+1])] == indices[sum(segment_lengths[:i])] + segment_lengths[i] + 1:
                if n > segment_lengths[i] + segment_lengths[i+1]:
                    # Merging part
                    max_length = max(max_length, segment_lengths[i] + segment_lengths[i+1] + 1)
                else:
                    max_length = max(max_length, segment_lengths[i] + segment_lengths[i+1])
    
    return max_length

# Test the function with example inputs
print(maxRepOpt1("ababa"))    # Output: 3
print(maxRepOpt1("aaabaaa"))  # Output: 6
print(maxRepOpt1("aaaaa"))    # Output: 5
print(maxRepOpt1("abcdef"))   # Output: 1
```

## Time Complexity
- **O(n)**: As we traverse the string multiple times (for index collection and segment calculation) but still in linear bounds.

The code leverages a linear scan and dictionary lookups to compute the longest possible substring of repeated characters after one swap efficiently.
