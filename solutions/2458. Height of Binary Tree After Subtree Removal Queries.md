title:  Height of Binary Tree After Subtree Removal Queries-out
permalink: /s2458
---

You are given the root of a binary tree and an array `queries` of integer values. For each query in `queries`, remove the subtree rooted at that value, and return the height of the tree after each removal.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the definition of the height of a binary tree?**
   - The height of a binary tree is the number of edges in the longest path from the root node to a leaf node.

2. **What should be done if the queried value does not exist in the tree?**
   - It should be assumed that the query value always exists in the tree.

3. **What constraints are we working under?**
   - The number of nodes in the tree: \( n \) where \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^5 \).
   - Node values are unique integers in the range \([1, n]\) for simplicity.

## Strategy

1. **Calculate Initial Tree Height:** 
   - Find the height of the initial tree before performing any removals.

2. **Perform Queries:** 
   - For each query, we need to remove the subtree starting at the node matching the query value.
   - Recalculate the height of the remaining tree.

3. **Recompute Height Efficiently:**
   - One naive way to do this might be to reconstruct the tree and recompute the height after each removal.
   - To optimize, we can precompute subtree heights and simulate the effect of removals without reconstructing the tree.

### Approach

1. **Precompute Heights:** 
   - Traverse the tree to compute and store the height of each subtree.
  
2. **Simulate Removal:**
   - For each query, use the precomputed data to determine the new height without actually removing nodes.

3. **Post-Order Traversal:**
   - Use post-order traversal to compute subtree heights efficiently.

### Computational Complexity

The algorithm is likely to involve:
- A single traversal of the tree (O(n)) to precompute the heights.
- Constant-time lookups for each query due to precomputation (O(1)).
- Thus, the overall complexity is \( O(n + k) \), where \( k \) is the number of queries.

## Code

Here is the code implementing the strategy:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def height_of_tree(root):
    if not root:
        return -1  # Height of empty tree is -1
    return 1 + max(height_of_tree(root.left), height_of_tree(root.right))

def precompute_subtree_heights(root, subtree_heights):
    if not root:
        return -1
    left_height = precompute_subtree_heights(root.left, subtree_heights)
    right_height = precompute_subtree_heights(root.right, subtree_heights)
    height = 1 + max(left_height, right_height)
    subtree_heights[root.val] = height
    return height

def subtree_height_after_removal(root, queries):
    if not root:
        return []
    
    subtree_heights = {}
    total_height = precompute_subtree_heights(root, subtree_heights)
    
    results = []
    for query in queries:
        result_height = total_height
        # Adjust the height by "simulating" the removal of the subtree
        if query in subtree_heights:
            result_height -= (subtree_heights[query] + 1)
        results.append(result_height)
    
    return results

# Example usage:
# Construct the tree
#      1
#     / \
#    2   3
#   /|   |\
#  4 5   6 7
root = TreeNode(1)
root.left = TreeNode(2)
root.right = TreeNode(3)
root.left.left = TreeNode(4)
root.left.right = TreeNode(5)
root.right.left = TreeNode(6)
root.right.right = TreeNode(7)

queries = [3, 2]
print(subtree_height_after_removal(root, queries))  # Output: Expected height changes
```

This approach uses precomputation to efficiently calculate the height of the tree after each query.
