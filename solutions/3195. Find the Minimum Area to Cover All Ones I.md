title:  Find the Minimum Area to Cover All Ones I-out
permalink: /s3195
---

You are given a binary matrix of size `n x m` that contains only 0s and 1s. You need to find the minimum area of a rectangle that covers all the '1's in the matrix. The sides of the rectangle should be parallel to the axes.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the constraints on `n` and `m`?
   - Are there any guarantees that there will be at least one '1' in the matrix?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the matrix contains no '1's, should we return 0 or is it guaranteed that there is at least one '1'?

3. **Output:**
   - Should the area be returned as an integer?

### Assumptions based on standard constraints:
- `n` and `m` can be reasonably large but will fit in memory.
- There will be at least one '1' in the matrix.

Would you like me to proceed with these assumptions?

### Strategy

To find the minimum area of a rectangle that covers all '1's in the matrix, we can follow these steps:

1. **Find Boundary Indices**:
   - Find the `topmost`, `bottommost`, `leftmost`, and `rightmost` positions of '1's in the matrix.
   - These indices can be found in a single pass by iterating through the matrix.

2. **Calculate Area**:
   - Calculate the area of the rectangle determined by these boundary indices.

### Code

Here is the Python code to achieve the required solution:

```python
def min_area_to_cover_ones(matrix):
    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
        return 0
    
    n = len(matrix)
    m = len(matrix[0])
    
    top, bottom, left, right = float('inf'), float('-inf'), float('inf'), float('-inf')
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if matrix[i][j] == 1:
                top = min(top, i)
                bottom = max(bottom, i)
                left = min(left, j)
                right = max(right, j)
    
    # If no '1' found, return 0
    if top == float('inf'):
        return 0
    
    # Calculate the area of the rectangle
    width = right - left + 1
    height = bottom - top + 1
    
    return width * height

# Example Usage
matrix = [
    [0, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0]
]

print(min_area_to_cover_ones(matrix))  # Output: 4
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize `top` to `infinity` and `bottom` to `-infinity` for row tracking.
   - Initialize `left` to `infinity` and `right` to `-infinity` for column tracking.

2. **Iterate through the matrix**:
   - For each cell that contains a '1', update `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` accordingly.

3. **Calculate the Area**:
   - The width of the rectangle is `right - left + 1`.
   - The height of the rectangle is `bottom - top + 1`.
   - The area is given by `width * height`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \times m)\) because we scan through the entire matrix once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) as we use a fixed amount of extra space regardless of input size.
