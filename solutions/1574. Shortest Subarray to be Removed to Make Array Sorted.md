title:  Shortest Subarray to be Removed to Make Array Sorted-out
permalink: /s1574
---

Given an integer array `arr` of size `n`, find the length of the shortest subarray, that if removed, will make `arr` sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Example:
- Input: `arr = [1,2,3,10,4,2,3,5]`
- Output: `3`
- Explanation: Removing the subarray `[10,4,2]` (at indices 3 to 5) makes the array sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Should the solution consider both removing and keeping contiguous subarrays from both ends?
2. Are there any specific requirements for the method of removing subarrays?

Assuming we proceed with these constraints and the problem statement as it stands.

## Strategy

1. **Identify Prefix and Suffix Sorted Arrays**: 
   - Compute the longest sorted prefix from the beginning of the array.
   - Compute the longest sorted suffix from the end of the array.
   
2. **Merge the Prefix and Suffix**:
   - Traverse from the end of the prefix and the start of the suffix to find the shortest subarray which, when removed, results in a sorted array.
   
3. **Overall Approach**:
   - Find the point where the unsorted section begins and ends.
   - Calculate possible sections to remove and determine the minimum length for the solution.

### Key Steps:
1. Traverse to find the longest prefix and suffix.
2. Check intermediate ranges to find the minimum subarray to remove.
3. Efficiently merge the sorted prefix and suffix to minimize the length.

### Time Complexity
- **O(n)** for traversing and finding the maximum it can merge.

## Code

```python
def findLengthOfShortestSubarray(arr):
    n = arr.length
    # Step 1: Identify the longest sorted prefix
    left = 0
    while left < n - 1 and arr[left] <= arr[left + 1]:
        left += 1
    
    # If the whole array is already sorted
    if left == n - 1:
        return 0
    
    # Step 2: Identify the longest sorted suffix
    right = n - 1
    while right > 0 and arr[right] >= arr[right - 1]:
        right -= 1
    
    # Step 3: Calculate minimum subarray to remove:
    # Two cases: 
    # 1. Remove middle part entirely
    # 2. Align left and right properly
    min_len = min(n - left - 1, right)
    
    i, j = 0, right
    while i <= left and j < n:
        if arr[i] <= arr[j]:
            min_len = min(min_len, j - i - 1)
            i += 1
        else:
            j += 1
    
    return min_len

# Example usage:
arr = [1, 2, 3, 10, 4, 2, 3, 5]
result = findLengthOfShortestSubarray(arr)
print(result)  # Output should be 3
```

### Explanation
1. **Identify Prefix and Suffix**: The prefix `1, 2, 3` and suffix `3, 5` are already sorted.
2. **Calculate Potential Removal**: Both from the start to the beginning of suffix `10, 4, 2` and end of prefix to right `10, 4, 2`, gives us our minimal point to remove which is `3`.

### Time Complexity
The overall process is linear, making it **O(n)**. This is efficient for the input size constraints.
