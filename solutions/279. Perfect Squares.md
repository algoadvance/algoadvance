Given an integer `n`, return the least number of perfect square numbers that sum to `n`.

A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of some integer with itself. For example, `1`, `4`, `9`, and `16` are perfect squares while `3` and `8` are not.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 12
Output: 3
Explanation: 12 = 4 + 4 + 4.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 13
Output: 2
Explanation: 13 = 4 + 9.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of `n`**: What is the range of the integer `n`? (The typical constraint in such problems is to ensure optimization concerns are clear.)
2. **Input Validity**: Can `n` be a negative number or zero? Usually, `n` is assumed positive.
3. **Single Output**: Should we only consider the minimum number of perfect squares, or are there cases where multiple solutions exist?

Let's proceed with the assumption that `n` is a positive integer, and we need to find the least number of perfect squares summing to `n`.

## Strategy

To solve the problem, a common approach is to use dynamic programming (DP). Here's the strategy in brief:

1. **DP Array Initialization**:
   - Create a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` will store the least number of perfect squares that sum up to `i`.
   - Initialize the DP array with infinity for all `i`, except `dp[0]` which is `0` (because zero numbers are needed to sum up to zero).

2. **Building the DP Array**:
   - For each number `i` from `1` to `n`, consider all perfect squares `j^2` (where `j^2 <= i`).
   - Update the DP array using the recurrence relation: `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - j^2] + 1)`

3. **Result**:
   - The answer to the problem will be `dp[n]`.

## Dynamic Programming Code

```python
def numSquares(n: int) -> int:
    import math
    
    # Create DP array with initially infinite values
    dp = [float('inf')] * (n + 1)
    dp[0] = 0  # Base case
    
    # List of all perfect squares less than or equal to `n`
    max_square_index = int(math.isqrt(n)) + 1
    squares = [i * i for i in range(1, max_square_index)]
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for square in squares:
            if i < square:
                break
            dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - square] + 1)
    
    return dp[n]
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n * sqrt(n))
  - We iterate through all integers from `1` to `n` (O(n)) and for each integer, we iterate through all perfect squares less than or equal to `i` (O(sqrt(n))).

- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - We use a DP array of size `n + 1`.

This solution efficiently finds the least number of perfect squares that sum to a given integer `n` using dynamic programming.
