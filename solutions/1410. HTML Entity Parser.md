Leetcode Problem 1410: HTML Entity Parser

Given a string `text`, you are to implement an HTML entity parser, which will replace the following predefined entities with their corresponding characters:

1. `&quot;` -> `" (double quote)`
2. `&apos;` -> `' (single quote)`
3. `&amp;` -> `& (ampersand)`
4. `&gt;` -> `> (greater than)`
5. `&lt;` -> `< (less than)`
6. `&frasl;` -> `/ (slash)`

The parser should return the resulting string.

#### Example:
```plaintext
Input: "and I quote: &quot;...&quot;"
Output: "and I quote: \"...\""
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the maximum length of the input string?
   - Assume the input string length does not exceed 10^6 characters.

2. **Edge Cases**: Are there any edge cases we should consider, such as strings without any entities or malformed entities?
   - Assume the input string will be valid and contain zero or more predefined HTML entities as specified.

3. **Output**: Should the output string be exactly the same as the input if no entities are found?
   - Yes, if there are no entities, the output should match the input exactly.

4. **Performance Constraints**: Is there a specific time complexity requirement?
   - Aim for an efficient solution that processes the input in linear time.

### Strategy

1. **Mapping**: Create a dictionary mapping each HTML entity to its corresponding character.
2. **Parsing**: Traverse the input string character by character while identifying any entities. 
3. **Replacement**: Replace identified entities using the dictionary.
4. **Edge Handling**: Account for edge cases such as incomplete entities overlapping with characters.

### Code

Here's a Python solution implementing the above strategy:

```python
def entity_parser(text: str) -> str:
    # Dictionary of HTML entities and their corresponding characters
    entity_to_char = {
        "&quot;": '"',
        "&apos;": "'",
        "&amp;": "&",
        "&gt;": ">",
        "&lt;": "<",
        "&frasl;": "/"
    }
    
    # Result array to collect characters and transformed entities
    result = []
    i = 0
    length = len(text)
    
    while i < length:
        if text[i] == '&':
            entity_found = False
            # Try to find the matching entity in predefined lengths
            for entity in entity_to_char.keys():
                if text[i:i+len(entity)] == entity:
                    result.append(entity_to_char[entity])
                    i += len(entity)
                    entity_found = True
                    break
            if not entity_found:
                result.append('&')
                i += 1
        else:
            result.append(text[i])
            i += 1
    
    return ''.join(result)

# Example usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    example_input = "and I quote: &quot;...&quot;"
    print(entity_parser(example_input))  # Output: 'and I quote: "..."'
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. Each character is processed exactly once.
  - The nested loop over entity lengths is performant since the total number of entities is small and the max length of any entity in the predefined list is 7.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the result array which stores the converted characters and entities.

This solution effectively handles the problem within the provided constraints, aiming for clarity and efficiency.
