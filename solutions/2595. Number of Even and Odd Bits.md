title:  Number of Even and Odd Bits-out
permalink: /s2595
---

You are given a positive integer `n`. You need to return an array `answer` of size 2 where `answer[0]` is the number of even-indexed bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n` (index starts from 0), and `answer[1]` is the number of odd-indexed bits set to 1 in the binary representation of `n`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:** Are there any specific constraints on the value of `n`?
   - Assume `1 <= n <= 10^9`.
   
2. **Bit Indexing:** Should the indexing start from the least significant bit (rightmost bit)?
   - Yes, indexing starts from the least significant bit (rightmost bit at index 0).

### Strategy

1. **Binary Representation and Indexing:** Convert the integer `n` to its binary representation. Traverse through each bit while keeping track of the indices to determine whether the bit is at an even or odd index.

2. **Counting the 1's:** As we traverse through the binary string, increment the corresponding counter when a bit set to `1` is found at either an even or odd index.

3. **Return Results:** Return the results in an array where the first element is the count of bits set to 1 at even indices, and the second element is the count of bits set to 1 at odd indices.

### Code Implementation

```python
def count_even_odd_bits(n: int) -> [int, int]:
    # Initialize counters for even-indexed and odd-indexed bits
    even_count = 0
    odd_count = 0

    # Convert n to its binary representation
    binary_n = bin(n)[2:]  # Remove the '0b' prefix
    
    # Traverse the binary string
    for idx, bit in enumerate(reversed(binary_n)):
        if bit == '1':
            if idx % 2 == 0:
                even_count += 1
            else:
                odd_count += 1
                
    return [even_count, odd_count]

# Example usage:
print(count_even_odd_bits(10))  # Output should be [2, 0] since binary 10 is '1010'
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(log n)**, which corresponds to the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`. Given that `n` can be up to \(10^9\), the number of bits is at most 30 (since \(2^{30}\) is slightly above \(10^9\)). This makes the solution efficient. 

- **Space Complexity:** **O(log n)** as well, due to the space used to store the binary string.
