title:  Find Edges in Shortest Paths-out
permalink: /s3123
---

You are given a graph represented by an adjacency list where each node has a list of its neighbors. Each edge in the graph has weight 1. You are required to find all the edges that are part of at least one shortest path from the start node to the target node.

Return the list of such edges in any order. Each edge should be represented by a tuple `(u, v)` indicating an edge from node `u` to node `v`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the graph directed or undirected?**
   - The problem can be solved for both cases, but we need to clarify the type to handle the graph properly.

2. **Can there be multiple edges between two nodes?**
   - This typically influences the approach to edge storage and path calculations.

3. **Is it guaranteed that there is a path from the start node to the target node?**
   - Important to know whether we need to handle cases where no path exists.

Assuming we are dealing with a simple directed graph and there is always a path from the start node to the target node.

### Strategy

1. **Use Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - Since each edge has the same weight, BFS is the optimal choice for finding the shortest paths.
  
2. **Track the Distances:**
   - Maintain a dictionary to store the minimum distance from the start node to each node
  
3. **Identify Shortest Paths:**
   - During the BFS, keep track of the predecessors for each node. By maintaining these relationships, we can backtrack from the target to find all edges involved in any shortest path.

4. **Extract the Edges:**
   - Using the predecessors, iterate from the target node back to the start node, collecting all relevant edges.

### Code

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

def find_shortest_path_edges(adj_list, start, target):
    # Step 1: Perform BFS to find the shortest path distances and predecessors
    distances = {start: 0}
    predecessors = defaultdict(list)
    queue = deque([start])
    
    while queue:
        current = queue.popleft()
        current_distance = distances[current]
        
        for neighbor in adj_list[current]:
            # When a shorter path to the neighbor is found
            if neighbor not in distances:
                distances[neighbor] = current_distance + 1
                queue.append(neighbor)
                predecessors[neighbor].append(current)
            elif distances[neighbor] == current_distance + 1:
                predecessors[neighbor].append(current)
    
    # Step 2: Extract edges
    def collect_edges(node):
        edges = []
        if node == start:
            return edges
        for pred in predecessors[node]:
            edges.append((pred, node))
            edges.extend(collect_edges(pred))
        return edges
    
    edges_in_paths = set(collect_edges(target))
    
    return list(edges_in_paths)

# Example Usage
adj_list = {
    1: [2, 3, 4],
    2: [3],
    3: [4],
    4: []
}

start = 1
target = 4

print(find_shortest_path_edges(adj_list, start, target))
```

### Time Complexity

1. **BFS Traversal:**
   - The BFS visits each node and each edge exactly once. Thus, the time complexity for BFS is \(O(V + E)\), where \(V\) is the number of vertices and \(E\) is the number of edges.

2. **Collecting Edges:**
   - In the worst case, each node can have a predecessor list as long as the number of nodes, making this another \(O(V + E)\) operation in the worst-case scenario.

Combining the steps, the overall time complexity remains \(O(V + E)\).

This approach ensures that we cover all possible shortest paths and identify all edges that participate in any shortest path from the start node to the target node.
