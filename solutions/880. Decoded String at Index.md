title:  Decoded String at Index-out
permalink: /s880
---
You are given an encoded string `s`. To decode the string to a tape, the encoded string is read one character at a time and the following steps are taken:

- If the character is a letter, that letter is written onto the tape.
- If the character is a digit (between `2` and `9`), the entire current tape is repeatedly written `d`-1 more times, where `d` is the digit.

Given an integer `k`, return the `k`-th letter (1-indexed) in the decoded string.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: s = "leet2code3", k = 10
Output: "o"

Input: s = "ha22", k = 5
Output: "h"
```

**Constraints:**
- `2 <= s.length <= 100`
- `1 <= k <= 10^9`
- `s` contains only lowercase English letters and digits `2` through `9`.
- It's guaranteed that `k` is less than or equal to the length of the decoded string.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Is it guaranteed that the encoded string `s` will be well-formed without any invalid characters?
2. Does the string always contain only lowercase letters and digits `2` through `9`?
3. Can `k` be larger than the length of the string `s`?

## Strategy
1. **Reverse Analysis:** Instead of decoding the string fully (which is impractical due to potential size), start analyzing the structure in reverse.
2. **Identify Loops and Characters:** By walking backward from the end of the string:
   - If it's a digit, adjust the `size` of the 'decoded' part accordingly.
   - If it's a letter, check if the current size includes the kth position.
3. **Calculating Effective Size:** Use tracking of the overall size of the decoded string during backward traversal to determine the exact point.
4. **Modulo Operation:** Utilize modular arithmetic to effectively reduce `k` as decoding progresses backward.

## Code
```python
def decodeAtIndex(s: str, k: int) -> str:
    size = 0
    # Find size of the decoded string
    for c in s:
        if c.isdigit():
            size *= int(c)
        else:
            size += 1
    
    for c in reversed(s):
        k %= size
        if k == 0 and c.isalpha():
            return c
        
        if c.isdigit():
            size //= int(c)
        else:
            size -= 1

# Example usage
print(decodeAtIndex("leet2code3", 10))  # Output: "o"
print(decodeAtIndex("ha22", 5))  # Output: "h"
```

## Explanation
1. **Initialize `size` to 0:** This keeps track of the size of the decoded string.
2. **Calculate Decoded Size:**
   - Traverse `s` and update `size`. For digits, multiply `size` by the digit value.
   - For letters, increment `size` by one.
3. **Traverse in Reverse:**
   - By reducing `k` using modular arithmetic (`k % size`), shrink the problem size.
   - When encountering a letter check if it's the kth position.
   - Adjust `size` backward for both digits and letters.
4. **Returning Result:** When `k == 0` for a letter, it means the current letter is the result.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`, since we're traversing the string a couple of times. This is efficient given the constraints.
