title:  Equal Sum Arrays With Minimum Number of Operations-out
permalink: /s1775
---

You are given two arrays of integers `nums1` and `nums2`, possibly of different lengths, and are tasked with equalizing the sum of the elements in the two arrays through a series of operations. An operation consists of incrementing or decrementing an element from one of the arrays by 1.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make the sums of the two arrays equal.

If it is not possible to make the sums equal, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

To ensure I correctly understand the problem, I'd like to ask a few clarifying questions:

1. What is the range of values that can be present in `nums1` and `nums2`?
2. Is there a limit on the length of the arrays `nums1` and `nums2`?
3. Can we assume that the arrays `nums1` and `nums2` are not empty?

### Strategy

Here's a step-by-step strategy to solve the problem:

1. **Calculate Initial Sums**: Compute the sums `sum1` and `sum2` of the arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively.
  
2. **Determine the Target Difference**: Compute the absolute difference between `sum1` and `sum2`, denoted as `diff`.

3. **Immediate Check for Quick Solutions**:
   - If `diff == 0`, then the sums are already equal and you can return `0` immediately.

4. **Sortable Opportunity List**:
   - To minimize operations, identify the maximum change that can be made to any element in `nums1` or `nums2`. For each element in `nums1`, the maximum change is `element - 1`. For each element in `nums2`, the maximum change is `6 - element`.
   - Collect these possible changes in a list and sort it in descending order.

5. **Greedy Reduction**:
   - Iterate through the sorted list of changes and apply them greedily to reduce the `diff` as much as possible with each operation.
   - Keep a count of the number of operations used.
   - If at any point during this iteration `diff` is reduced to `0`, return the count of operations.

6. **Check for Impossibility**:
   - After exhausting all possible changes, if `diff` is still not `0`, it is impossible to equalize the sums and we should return `-1`.

### Code

```python
def minOperations(nums1, nums2):
    sum1, sum2 = sum(nums1), sum(nums2)
    if sum1 == sum2:
        return 0
    
    # Make sure sum1 is always the larger sum
    if sum1 < sum2:
        nums1, nums2 = nums2, nums1
        sum1, sum2 = sum2, sum1
    
    diff = sum1 - sum2

    # Max gain for each number in nums1 is num - 1 (because max number is 6)
    # and for nums2 is 6 - num
    changes = []
    
    for num in nums1:
        changes.append(num - 1)  # potential decrease from nums1 elements
    for num in nums2:
        changes.append(6 - num)  # potential increase from nums2 elements

    # Sort changes in descending order to maximize each operation
    changes.sort(reverse=True)
    
    operations = 0
    for change in changes:
        if diff <= 0:
            break
        diff -= change
        operations += 1
    
    return operations if diff <= 0 else -1
```

### Time Complexity

- **Calculating Initial Sums**: \( O(n + m) \) where \( n \) and \( m \) are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.
- **Generating Changes List**: \( O(n + m) \).
- **Sorting Changes List**: \( O((n + m) \log(n + m)) \).
- **Iterating Over Changes**: \( O(n + m) \).

Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which makes it \( O((n + m) \log(n + m)) \). The space complexity is \( O(n + m) \) for the storage of the changes list.
