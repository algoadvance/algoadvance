title:  Minimum Absolute Sum Difference-out
permalink: /s1818
---

We are given two arrays of integers `nums1` and `nums2` of the same length `n`. The *absolute sum difference* of these two arrays is defined as the sum of `|nums1[i] - nums2[i]|` for each `0 <= i < n`.

We can replace at most one element from `nums1` with any other element from `nums1` to minimize this absolute sum difference and return the minimum possible absolute sum difference.

Since the absolute sum difference can be quite large, we will return the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

* Example 1:
  ```
  Input: nums1 = [1,7,5], nums2 = [2,3,5]
  Output: 3
  Explanation: There are two possible optimal solutions:
  - Replace the second element with any element of nums1; the array becomes [1,1,5], [1,5,5], [1,3,5], etc. and the sum difference is 3.
  ```

* Example 2:
  ```
  Input: nums1 = [2,4,6,8,10], nums2 = [2,4,6,8,10]
  Output: 0
  Explanation: The array [2,4,6,8,10] is already optimal.
  ```

* Example 3:
  ```
  Input: nums1 = [1,10,4,4,2,7], nums2 = [9,3,5,1,7,4]
  Output: 20
  Explanation: Replace the first element with any element of nums1; the array becomes [7,10,4,4,2,7] and the sum difference is 20.
  ```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the arrays always the same length?
   - Yes, the arrays `nums1` and `nums2` will always be of the same length `n`.

2. What is the range of the elements in the arrays?
   - The range is guaranteed to be within the bounds of typical integer values for computational problems.

3. Do the elements in `nums1` have any constraints in terms of uniqueness?
   - No, elements in `nums1` can have duplicates.

4. Are there any constraints that guarantee the elements of `nums2` to be within a certain range or unique?
   - No specific constraints on `nums2` elements were provided regarding their values or uniqueness.

## Strategy

1. **Initial Abs Difference Sum Calculation**: Calculate the initial absolute sum difference without making any replacements.
2. **Binary Search for Optimal Replacement**: To find the optimal replacement quickly, we can use binary search on a sorted copy of `nums1`. This allows us to find the closest value to `nums2[i]` in `nums1`, thus minimizing the difference.
3. **Update the Minimum Sum**: Calculate the new sum difference if we replace `nums1[i]` with this closest value. Track the minimum sum difference encountered.

### Steps

1. Initialize the initial absolute sum difference.
2. Sort `nums1` to facilitate binary search.
3. For each element in `nums2`, determine the current difference and use binary search in the sorted `nums1` to find the closest replacement to minimize the new difference.
4. Return the minimum possible sum difference modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Code

```python
import bisect

def minAbsoluteSumDiff(nums1, nums2):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    n = len(nums1)
    
    # Calculate the initial absolute sum difference
    initial_sum = sum(abs(nums1[i] - nums2[i]) for i in range(n))
    
    # Clone and sort nums1 for binary search
    sorted_nums1 = sorted(nums1)

    max_improvement = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        original_diff = abs(nums1[i] - nums2[i])
        # Binary search for the closest value to nums2[i]
        pos = bisect.bisect_left(sorted_nums1, nums2[i])
        
        if pos < n:
            max_improvement = max(max_improvement, original_diff - abs(sorted_nums1[pos] - nums2[i]))
        
        if pos > 0:
            max_improvement = max(max_improvement, original_diff - abs(sorted_nums1[pos - 1] - nums2[i]))

    return (initial_sum - max_improvement) % MOD

# Example use case
nums1 = [1, 7, 5]
nums2 = [2, 3, 5]
print(minAbsoluteSumDiff(nums1, nums2))  # Output should be 3
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Sorting**: Sorting `nums1` takes `O(n log n)`.
2. **Binary Search**: For each element in `nums2`, the binary search in `sorted_nums1` takes `O(log n)`. Thus, for `n` elements, it takes `O(n log n)`.

Therefore, the overall complexity is `O(n log n)` primarily due to the sorting and binary search steps.
