title:  Random Point in Non-overlapping Rectangles-out
permalink: /s497
---

You are given an array of non-overlapping axis-aligned rectangles `rects`, where rects[i] = [ai, bi, xi, yi] indicates that (ai, bi) is the coordinate of the bottom-left corner, and (xi, yi) is the coordinate of the top-right corner of the ith rectangle. Design an algorithm to pick a random integer point inside one of the given rectangles. A point on the perimeter of a rectangle is considered to be inside it.

Implement the `Solution` class:

- `Solution(int[][] rects)` Initializes the object with the given rectangles rects.
- `int[] pick()` Returns a random integer point `[u, v]` inside one of the given rectangles.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What kind of distribution should the random point follow?**
   - The random point should be uniformly distributed across all the rectangles.

2. **Can the rectangles be degenerate (zero area)?**
   - The description implies that all rectangles have non-zero area as they are explicitly called out as non-overlapping.

3. **Will I need to handle any invalid inputs, such as malformed rectangles?**
   - No, assume the input is always valid as per the problem statement constraints.

## Strategy

1. **Precompute Areas:**
   - Calculate the area (number of points) of each rectangle.
   - Maintain a cumulative distribution of areas to facilitate weighted random selection of a rectangle.

2. **Selecting a Rectangle:**
   - Using the cumulative distribution, pick a rectangle based on the weight of its area. This ensures the probability of selecting any point is uniform across all points in all rectangles.

3. **Selecting a Point Inside a Rectangle:**
   - Once a rectangle is selected, pick a random point within the bounds of the rectangle.

## Code

Here's the code to implement this strategy:

```python
import random
import itertools

class Solution:
    def __init__(self, rects: List[List[int]]):
        self.rects = rects
        # Compute cumulative weights for the areas of the rectangles
        self.weights = []
        current_area = 0
        
        for rect in rects:
            # Calculate number of points in this rectangle
            x1, y1, x2, y2 = rect
            area = (x2 - x1 + 1) * (y2 - y1 + 1)
            current_area += area
            self.weights.append(current_area)
    
    def pick(self) -> List[int]:
        # Pick a random point choosing rectangle based on area-weighted distribution
        target = random.randint(1, self.weights[-1])
        
        # Binary search to find the correct rectangle
        left, right = 0, len(self.weights) - 1
        while left < right:
            mid = left + (right - left) // 2
            if target > self.weights[mid]:
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid
        
        # 'left' should now indicate the selected rectangle
        x1, y1, x2, y2 = self.rects[left]
        
        # Pick a random point within this rectangle
        random_x = random.randint(x1, x2)
        random_y = random.randint(y1, y2)
        
        return [random_x, random_y]
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization (`__init__` method):** O(n), where n is the number of rectangles since we need to compute the cumulative distribution of areas.
- **Selection (`pick` method):** O(log n) to select the rectangle using binary search, and O(1) to pick a point inside the rectangle.

This solution is efficient and well-suited for the problem constraints.
