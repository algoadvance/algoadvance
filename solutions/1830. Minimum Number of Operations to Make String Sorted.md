title:  Minimum Number of Operations to Make String Sorted-out
permalink: /s1830
---

You are given a string `s` (1-indexed). You can perform the following operation on `s` any number of times:

- Choose any non-empty substring of `s`, sort it in-place so the characters inside the substring are in lexicographically non-decreasing order.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make `s` sorted in lexicographically non-decreasing order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What constitutes an operation?**
   Choosing any non-empty substring of the given string and sorting it in-place.
   
2. **What should we consider in the input string?**
   The input is a simple string of lowercase English letters.

3. **Is the string mutable?**
   For the purpose of performing operations, we will assume the string can be modified as needed.

### Code
```python
class Solution:
    def makeStringSorted(self, s: str) -> int:
        MOD = 10**9 + 7

        # Function to compute factorial % MOD
        def factorial(n):
            fact = [1] * (n + 1)
            for i in range(2, n + 1):
                fact[i] = fact[i - 1] * i % MOD
            return fact
        
        # Function to compute modular inverse using Fermat's Little Theorem
        def mod_inverse(x, mod):
            return pow(x, mod - 2, mod)
        
        n = len(s)
        fact = factorial(n)
        
        # Frequency of each character in the remaining suffix
        freq = [0] * 26
        for c in s:
            freq[ord(c) - ord('a')] += 1
        
        res = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            curr = ord(s[i]) - ord('a')
            for j in range(curr):
                if freq[j] > 0:
                    # Calculate the permutations count of the suffix
                    perm = fact[n - i - 1]
                    for k in range(26):
                        perm = perm * mod_inverse(fact[freq[k]], MOD) % MOD
                    res = (res + perm) % MOD
            freq[curr] -= 1
        
        return res

# Example usage:
s = "cba"
solution = Solution()
print(solution.makeStringSorted(s))  # Output: 5
```

### Strategy

1. **Count Frequencies:** Calculate the frequency of each character in the string.

2. **Factorials and Inverses:** Precompute the factorials and modular inverses of the factorials using Fermat's Little Theorem for combinatorial calculations.

3. **Iterate Through String:** For each character in the string, calculate the number of operations needed to move the character to the right place using the permutations of the remaining characters.

4. **Permutations Calculation:** To calculate how many different permutations of remaining characters can be made where a smaller character is in front, use the precomputed factorials and modular inverses.

5. **Modulo Operation:** Use modulo `10^9 + 7` to keep numbers manageable.

### Time Complexity

- **Factorial Precomputation:** \(O(n)\) for computing the factorials and modular inverses.
- **Main Loop:** \(O(n \cdot 26) = O(n)\) â€” where \(n\) is the length of the string, iterating and calculating based on fixed number of characters (constant 26).
  
Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is \(O(n)\).
