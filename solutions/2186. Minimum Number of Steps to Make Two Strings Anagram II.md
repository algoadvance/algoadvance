title:  Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram II-out
permalink: /s2186
---

We are given two strings `s` and `t`. We have to return the minimum number of steps to make `s` and `t` anagrams. In one step, we can delete exactly one character in either string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the definition of an anagram in this context?**
   - Two strings are anagrams if they contain the same characters the same number of times.

2. **What should be returned as a result?**
   - The function should return an integer representing the minimum number of steps required.

3. **Are the inputs guaranteed to be lowercase English letters?**
   - Typically, in problems like this, yes. Let's assume `s` and `t` contain only lowercase English letters.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we need to determine how many characters we need to delete from each string to make the remaining characters' counts match in both strings.

1. **Frequency Count:**
   - Compute the frequency of each character in both `s` and `t`.

2. **Calculate Necessary Deletions:**
   - For each character that appears in either string, determine the absolute difference in the frequency counts. This difference represents the number of deletions needed for that character.

3. **Sum the Deletions:**
   - Sum the deletions for all characters to get the total number of steps required.

### Code

```python
from collections import Counter

def minSteps(s: str, t: str) -> int:
    # Count the frequency of each character in both strings
    count_s = Counter(s)
    count_t = Counter(t)
    
    # Set of all unique characters in both strings
    unique_chars = set(count_s.keys()).union(set(count_t.keys()))
    
    total_steps = 0
    
    # Calculate total deletions needed
    for char in unique_chars:
        total_steps += abs(count_s.get(char, 0) - count_t.get(char, 0))
    
    return total_steps

# Example usage:
s = "leetcode"
t = "coats"
print(minSteps(s, t))  # Output should be 7
```

### Walkthrough of Example

For `s = "leetcode"` and `t = "coats"`:

- Character counts for `s`: {'l': 1, 'e': 3, 't': 1, 'c': 1, 'o': 1, 'd': 1}
- Character counts for `t`: {'c': 1, 'o': 1, 'a': 1, 't': 1, 's': 1}

Unique characters: `{'l', 'e', 't', 'c', 'o', 'd', 'a', 's'}`
- 'l': 1 in `s`, 0 in `t` -> 1 deletion
- 'e': 3 in `s`, 0 in `t` -> 3 deletions
- 't': 1 in `s`, 1 in `t` -> 0 deletions
- 'c': 1 in `s`, 1 in `t` -> 0 deletions
- 'o': 1 in `s`, 1 in `t` -> 0 deletions
- 'd': 1 in `s`, 0 in `t` -> 1 deletion
- 'a': 0 in `s`, 1 in `t` -> 1 deletion
- 's': 0 in `s`, 1 in `t` -> 1 deletion

Total deletions required: 1 + 3 + 1 + 1 + 1 = 7

### Time Complexity

- Constructing frequency counts takes O(n + m) where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `s` and `t`.
- Iterating through combined unique characters in both strings takes O(1) because there are at most 26 characters.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n + m).
