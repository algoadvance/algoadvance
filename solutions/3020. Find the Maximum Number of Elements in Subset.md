title:  Find the Maximum Number of Elements in Subset-out
permalink: /s3020
---

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `m`. Your task is to find the maximum number of elements in a subset of the array such that the sum of the subset is divisible by `m`.

### Input:
- An integer array `nums` of size `n`.
- An integer `m`.

### Output:
- Return the maximum number of elements in a subset of `nums` such that the sum of the subset is divisible by `m`.

### Example:
```python
Input: nums = [3, 1, 4, 2, 2], m = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The subset [3, 4, 2] has a sum of 9, which is divisible by 3.
```

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Constraints on Inputs**: Are there any constraints on the size of the array `n` or on the values of the elements in `nums` and `m`?
2. **Negative Numbers**: Can `nums` contain negative numbers?
3. **Edge Cases**: What should be returned if `nums` is empty or if no valid subset exists?

## Strategy:
1. **Modulo Operation**:
   - First, compute the remainder of each element in `nums` when divided by `m`.
   - Use a frequency array to count these remainders.

2. **Subset Sum DP**:
   - Use dynamic programming to keep track of possible subset sums that are divisible by `m`.
   - `dp[i]` will represent the maximum number of elements in a subset with sum `i % m`.

3. **Update Rule**:
   - Iterate through the elements of `nums` and update the `dp` array based on the current element's remainder.

### Steps:
1. Initialize a DP array with size `m` to keep track of the maximum number of elements for each possible remainder.
2. Iterate through `nums` and update the DP array accordingly.

## Time Complexity:
- The time complexity will be O(n * m) because, for each element in `nums`, we need to update the DP array which takes O(m) time.

## Code:

```python
def maxNumElementsDivisibleByM(nums, m):
    if not nums:
        return 0

    # Initialize the dp array to store the max number of elements for each remainder state
    dp = [float('-inf')] * m
    dp[0] = 0

    for num in nums:
        remainder = num % m
        
        # Create a temporary copy of dp to update the new state values
        new_dp = dp[:]
        
        for r in range(m):
            if dp[r] != float('-inf'):
                new_r = (r + remainder) % m
                new_dp[new_r] = max(new_dp[new_r], dp[r] + 1)
        
        dp = new_dp
    
    return dp[0] if dp[0] != float('-inf') else 0


# Example use case
nums = [3, 1, 4, 2, 2]
m = 3
print(maxNumElementsDivisibleByM(nums, m))  # Output: 3
```

## Explanation:
1. We initialize the DP array `dp` with size `m`, where `dp[i]` will hold the maximum number of elements forming a subset whose sum leaves a remainder of `i` when divided by `m`.
2. For each number in `nums`, calculate its remainder when divided by `m`.
3. For each possible remainder `r` in the DP array, compute the new possible remainder when adding the current number.
4. Update the DP array with the maximum subset size achievable with this new remainder.
5. Finally, return `dp[0]`, which will have the maximum subset size whose sum is divisible by `m`.

Iterate on this solution to handle additional edge cases based on constraints given during problem clarification.
