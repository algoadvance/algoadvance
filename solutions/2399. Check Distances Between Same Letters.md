title:  Check Distances Between Same Letters-out
permalink: /s2399
---
Given a string `s` of lowercase English letters and an array of integers `distance` of length 26, where `distance[i]` represents the desired distance between the two occurrences of the i-th letter in the alphabet (0-indexed), return true if for every letter in `s`, the distance between the two occurrences of the letter is equal to the respective value in the `distance` array. Otherwise, return false.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What happens if a letter appears more than twice in the string?
   - **A:** The problem statement assumes each letter will appear exactly twice if it appears in the string.
   
2. **Q:** Can the string or distance array be empty?
   - **A:** The problem assumes that `s` and `distance` will have appropriate lengths as described in the problem constraints.

### Strategy
1. Iterate over the string `s` and keep track of the first occurrence of each letter with the help of a dictionary.
2. Calculate the actual distance between two occurrences of each letter.
3. Compare this actual distance with the pre-specified distance in the `distance` array.

### Code
Here's the code implementing the strategy:

```python
def checkDistances(s: str, distance: list[int]) -> bool:
    letter_pos = {}
    
    for idx, char in enumerate(s):
        if char in letter_pos:
            actual_distance = idx - letter_pos[char] - 1
            expected_distance = distance[ord(char) - ord('a')]
            if actual_distance != expected_distance:
                return False
        else:
            letter_pos[char] = idx
    
    return True

# Example usage:
s = "abaccb"
distance = [1, 2, 0, ...]  # for simplicity in this example
print(checkDistances(s, distance))  # Output should be True or False based on the distance array
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. We scan through the string once and perform constant-time dictionary operations.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), because the size of the dictionary is bounded by the number of lowercase English letters which is 26, so it's constant space.
