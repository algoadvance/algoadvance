Leetcode Problem 1652: **Defuse the Bomb**

You have a bomb to defuse, and your time is running out! Your informer will provide you with a circular array `code` of length `n` and a key `k`.

To deactivate the bomb, you must replace every number in the `code` array with a new number. The new number at position `i` will be obtained by summing the next `k` numbers in the `code` (if `k` is positive) or the previous `k` numbers (if `k` is negative). If `k` is zero, the new numbers will be all zeros.

Since the array is circular, if `k` is positive, the sum of the next `k` numbers will wrap around to the beginning of the array; if `k` is negative, the sum of the previous `k` numbers will wrap around to the end of the array.

You need to return the transformed array to stop the bomb from exploding.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: code = [5,7,1,4], k = 3
Output: [12,10,16,13]
Explanation: Each element in the output array is obtained by summing the next 3 elements in the circular array.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: code = [1,2,3,4], k = 0
Output: [0,0,0,0]
Explanation: When k is 0, all elements in the output array are 0.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: code = [2,4,9,3], k = -2
Output: [12,5,6,13]
Explanation: When k is negative, the sum of the previous 2 elements is returned.
```

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Is the input array always non-empty?**
   - Yes, according to the problem constraints.
2. **Is the value of `k` guaranteed to be within a specific range?**
   - Yes, `k` is within the range `[-n, n]` where `n` is the length of the `code` array.
3. **Should we consider `k = 0` as a special case?**
   - Yes, if `k = 0`, we return an array of the same length with all zeros.

### Strategy:

1. **Handling `k = 0`**:
   - Directly return an array of zeros of the same length as `code`.
2. **Handling positive `k`**:
   - For each index `i`, sum the next `k` elements wrapping around the array using modulo arithmetic.
3. **Handling negative `k`**:
   - For each index `i`, sum the previous `k` elements wrapping around the array using modulo arithmetic.

### Code:

```python
def decrypt(code, k):
    n = len(code)
    result = [0] * n
    
    if k == 0:
        return result
    
    for i in range(n):
        if k > 0:
            result[i] = sum(code[(i+j+1) % n] for j in range(k))
        else:
            result[i] = sum(code[(i+j) % n] for j in range(k, 0))
    
    return result

# Example Usage
print(decrypt([5, 7, 1, 4], 3)) # Output: [12, 10, 16, 13]
print(decrypt([1, 2, 3, 4], 0)) # Output: [0, 0, 0, 0]
print(decrypt([2, 4, 9, 3], -2)) # Output: [12, 5, 6, 13]
```

### Time Complexity:

- The solution iterates over each element of the array once and performs a sum operation over at most `k` elements:
  - **Time complexity is O(n * |k|)** where `n` is the length of the `code` array and `|k|` is the absolute value of `k`.
  
Given that `k` is within the range `[-n, n]`, this is an efficient approach consistent with the problem constraints.
