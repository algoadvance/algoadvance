title:  Sum of k-Mirror Numbers-out
permalink: /s2081
---

A k-mirror number is an integer that, when written in base `k`, reads the same forwards and backwards. A `k-mirror` number retains this symmetric property regardless of the number's base conversion. The task is to find the sum of the first `n` k-mirror numbers. We need to implement a function:

```python
def kMirror(k: int, n: int) -> int
```

Here's the input/output format:
- `k`: a base (integer >= 2).
- `n`: number of k-mirror numbers to find.

The function should return the sum of the first `n` numbers that are `k-mirror` numbers.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Base Constraints**:
    - What is the maximum value for `k` and `n`?
    - Are the numbers guaranteed to fit within standard integer ranges?

2. **Output**:
    - Should the function return just the sum, or should it also output the `n` k-mirror numbers?

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - How should the function handle cases where `k` is the same as the default number base of integers (base 10)?

## Strategy

1. **Helper Function**:
    - Write a helper function `is_palindrome` to check if a number is a palindrome in base `k`.

2. **Base Conversion**:
    - Convert numbers to base `k` format using a conversion helper function.

3. **Iterative Search**:
    - Iterate through natural numbers, convert them to base `k`, and check if they are palindromes.
    - Maintain a count of `k-mirror` numbers found and stop when `n` numbers are found.

4. **Sum Calculation**:
    - Keep a running sum of the `k-mirror` numbers found.

## Code

```python
def is_palindrome(s: str) -> bool:
    return s == s[::-1]

def to_base_k(num: int, k: int) -> str:
    if num == 0:
        return "0"
    digits = []
    while num:
        digits.append(int(num % k))
        num = num // k
    return ''.join(str(x) for x in digits[::-1])

def kMirror(k: int, n: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    current_num = 1
    total_sum = 0
    
    while count < n:
        base_k_rep = to_base_k(current_num, k)
        if is_palindrome(base_k_rep):
            if is_palindrome(str(current_num)):  # Also check in base 10
                total_sum += current_num
                count += 1
        current_num += 1
    
    return total_sum
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Time Complexity Analysis**:
    - Converting a number `num` to base `k` takes \(O(\log_k{num})\) time.
    - Checking if a string is a palindrome takes \(O(m)\) time, where `m` is the length of the string.
    - This results in a rough estimate of \(O(n \cdot \log(num_{max}) \cdot m)\), where `num_{max}` is the largest number needed to find our `n` k-mirror numbers.

2. **Space Complexity Analysis**:
    - The space complexity is mainly due to storing the string representation of the number in base `k`, which should be \(O(\log_k{num})\). 

Be sure to test the code with various inputs to ensure correctness and efficiency.
