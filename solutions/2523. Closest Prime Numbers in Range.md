title:  Closest Prime Numbers in Range-out
permalink: /s2523
---

You are asked to find the two prime numbers that are closest to each other in a given inclusive range `[left, right]`. The function signature is:

```python
def closestPrimes(left: int, right: int) -> List[int]:
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**:
    - What is the valid range for `left` and `right`? Are they limited to any specific domain (e.g., both are positive integers)?
2. **Output**:
    - Should the function return a list of two integers representing the closest prime numbers in the range? If no prime numbers or only one exists within the range, what should the function return?
3. **Edge Cases**:
    - What should the function do if `left` equals `right`?
    - What should be done if there are no prime numbers in the given range?

Once these clarifications are answered, we can proceed with the solution.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can take the following steps:

1. **Generate Primes Using Sieve of Eratosthenes**: We can generate prime numbers up to `right` using the Sieve of Eratosthenes. This is efficient for finding all prime numbers up to a specified limit.
2. **Filter Primes in the Range**: Once we have the prime numbers, we filter out those that lie within the `[left, right]` range.
3. **Find Closest Primes**: Iterate through the list of primes in the given range and find the pair with the minimum difference.

### Time Complexity

- **Sieve of Eratosthenes**: \(O(n \log \log n)\), where \(n = \text{right}\).
- **Filtering and Finding Closest Primes**: \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the number of primes in the range `[left, right]`.

### Code

Here is the implementation of the solution:

```python
from typing import List

def closestPrimes(left: int, right: int) -> List[int]:
    def sieve(n: int) -> List[bool]:
        is_prime = [True] * (n + 1)
        is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False  # 0 and 1 are not prime numbers
        p = 2
        while (p * p <= n):
            if is_prime[p]:
                for i in range(p * p, n + 1, p):
                    is_prime[i] = False
            p += 1
        return is_prime
    
    if right < 2:
        # No primes are less than 2
        return [-1, -1]

    # Step 1: Generate primes up to right using Sieve of Eratosthenes
    is_prime = sieve(right)
    
    # Step 2: Filter primes within the range [left, right]
    primes = [i for i in range(left, right + 1) if is_prime[i]]
    
    # Step 3: Find the closest pair of primes
    if len(primes) < 2:
        return [-1, -1]
    
    min_diff = float('inf')
    closest_pair = [-1, -1]
    
    for i in range(1, len(primes)):
        diff = primes[i] - primes[i - 1]
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
            closest_pair = [primes[i - 1], primes[i]]
    
    return closest_pair

# Example usage:
print(closestPrimes(10, 50))  # Output: [11, 13]
```

### Explanation

1. **Sieve Function**: The `sieve` function generates a boolean array `is_prime` where `is_prime[i]` is `True` if `i` is a prime number.
2. **Filter Primes**: We filter out only those primes that fall within the given range `[left, right]`.
3. **Find Closest Primes**: We iterate through the filtered primes and keep track of the pair with the smallest difference.

This solution ensures efficiency and correctness for finding the closest prime numbers within a given range.
