title:  Flip Equivalent Binary Trees-out
permalink: /s951
---

Given two binary trees, `root1` and `root2`, the task is to determine if they are flip equivalent. Two binary trees are flip equivalent if they are the same when both tree structures and node values are considered, except that some children of both trees have been swapped by flipping the parent node.

### Example

```
Input: root1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8], root2 = [1,3,2,null,6,4,5,null,null,null,null,8,7]
Output: True
Explanation: We flipped at nodes with values 1, 3, and 5.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. How do we represent an empty tree in the input? 
   - An empty tree can be represented with `None`.
2. Is there any specific range for the values of the nodes?
   - The problem does not specify a value range. Assume the values of nodes can be any integer.

## Strategy

1. **Base Cases**: 
   - Both nodes are None -> Trees are equivalent.
   - One node is None -> Trees are not equivalent.
   - Node values are different -> Trees are not equivalent.

2. **Recursive Case**:
   - Recursively check if children are equivalent without flipping.
   - Recursively check if children are equivalent with flipping.

We use a recursive function to traverse both trees simultaneously and apply the above conditions to determine if they are flip equivalent.

## Code

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def flip_equiv(root1: TreeNode, root2: TreeNode) -> bool:
    # Base cases
    if root1 is None and root2 is None:
        return True
    if root1 is None or root2 is None:
        return False
    if root1.val != root2.val:
        return False
    
    # Recursive case
    no_flip = flip_equiv(root1.left, root2.left) and flip_equiv(root1.right, root2.right)
    flip = flip_equiv(root1.left, root2.right) and flip_equiv(root1.right, root2.left)
    
    return no_flip or flip
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in either tree. This is because each node in both trees is visited once during the traversal.

The space complexity is \(O(H)\), where \(H\) is the height of the tree, due to the recursive call stack. In the worst case (completely unbalanced tree), this can be \(O(N)\), but in the best case (completely balanced tree), it will be \(O(\log N)\).
