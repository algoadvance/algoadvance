Given a `m x n` matrix `mat` and an integer `K`, return a matrix `answer` where each `answer[i][j]` is the sum of all elements `mat[r][c]` for which `i - K <= r <= i + K` and `j - K <= c <= j + K`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What are the minimum and maximum values for `m`, `n`, and `K`?
   
     **Answer:** 1 <= m, n, K <= 100.
   
2. **Element Constraints**:
   - What values can the elements of `mat` take?
   
     **Answer:** Elements of `mat` can be any integer (both positive and negative).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - How should the algorithm handle elements outside the boundaries of the matrix when summing for cells near the edges?
   
     **Answer:** Assume out-of-bound elements are treated as zero.

### Strategy:

To solve the problem efficiently, we can use the concept of "prefix sum" which allows us to compute the sum of any submatrix in constant time after a preprocessing step.

#### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Compute Prefix Sum Matrix**:
   - Create an auxiliary matrix `prefix_sum` where `prefix_sum[i][j]` contains the sum of all matrix elements before `(i, j)` inclusive.
   
2. **Fill in the Answer Matrix**:
   - For each cell `(i, j)` in the matrix `mat`, use the prefix sum matrix to compute the sum of all elements in the block centered at `(i, j)` and extending `K` units in all directions.
   
3. **Handle Boundaries**:
   - Ensure that when computing the sum for regions near the edges of the matrix, indices extending outside are handled correctly (treated as 0).

### Code:

```python
def matrixBlockSum(mat, K):
    m, n = len(mat), len(mat[0])
    
    # Step 1: Create and populate the prefix sum matrix
    prefix_sum = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            prefix_sum[i][j] = (mat[i-1][j-1] 
                                + prefix_sum[i-1][j] 
                                + prefix_sum[i][j-1] 
                                - prefix_sum[i-1][j-1])
    
    # Step 2: Compute the answer matrix using the prefix sum matrix
    answer = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            r1, c1 = max(0, i - K), max(0, j - K)
            r2, c2 = min(m, i + K + 1), min(n, j + K + 1)
            
            answer[i][j] = (prefix_sum[r2][c2] 
                            - prefix_sum[r1][c2] 
                            - prefix_sum[r2][c1] 
                            + prefix_sum[r1][c1])
    
    return answer

# Example usage:
mat = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
K = 1

print(matrixBlockSum(mat, K))
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Prefix Sum Matrix Construction:** \(O(m \cdot n)\)
- **Computing Answer Matrix:** \(O(m \cdot n)\)
- Total: \(O(m \cdot n)\)

**This is efficient for the given constraints and ensures that even large matrices are processed in a reasonable amount of time.**

### Test Cases:

1. **Basic Small Case**:
   ```python
   assert matrixBlockSum([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], 1) == [[12,21,16],[27,45,33],[24,39,28]]
   ```
2. **Single Element Matrix**:
   ```python
   assert matrixBlockSum([[5]], 1) == [[5]]
   ```
3. **Edge Case with K Larger than Matrix Dimensions**:
   ```python
   assert matrixBlockSum([[1,2],[3,4]], 3) == [[10,10],[10,10]]
   ```

These test cases should effectively validate the correctness of the implementation.
