title:  Divisible and Non-divisible Sums Difference-out
permalink: /s2894
---

Given a list of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the difference between the sum of elements in the list that are divisible by `k` and the sum of elements that are not divisible by `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the size of the list?**
    - No specific constraints are mentioned; assume it fits in memory.

2. **What should be returned if the list is empty?**
    - Return `0` since the sums of both divisible and non-divisible elements would be `0`.

3. **Can the numbers in the list be negative?**
    - Yes, integers can be both positive and negative.

4. **Is `k` guaranteed to be non-zero?**
    - Yes, assume `k` is always non-zero to avoid division by zero.

### Strategy

1. Initialize two sums: `sum_divisible` and `sum_non_divisible`.
2. Iterate through each number in `nums`.
3. If the number is divisible by `k`, add it to `sum_divisible`.
4. Otherwise, add it to `sum_non_divisible`.
5. Return the difference between `sum_divisible` and `sum_non_divisible`.

```python
def difference_of_sums(nums, k):
    sum_divisible = 0
    sum_non_divisible = 0

    for num in nums:
        if num % k == 0:
            sum_divisible += num
        else:
            sum_non_divisible += num

    return sum_divisible - sum_non_divisible

# Example usage
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
k = 3
print(difference_of_sums(nums, k))  # Output: -9 (0 because (3+6)-(sum(1, 2, 4, 5, 7)) equals -17)
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the list `nums`. This is because we iterate through the list exactly once, performing a constant amount of work for each element. 

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since we use only a fixed amount of additional space regardless of the input size.
