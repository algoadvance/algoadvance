title:  Categorize Box According to Criteria-out
permalink: /s2525
---

You are given a box with four parameters: length, width, height, and mass. Your task is to categorize the box based on the given criteria:

1. **Bulky**: A box is considered bulky if any of the dimensions (length, width, or height) of the box is greater than or equal to \(10^4\) or if the volume of the box is greater than or equal to \(10^9\).

2. **Heavy**: A box is considered heavy if its mass is greater than or equal to 100.

3. **Categories**:
   - The box can belong to multiple categories.
   - It can be categorized as:
     - "Bulky" (if the box is bulky but not heavy)
     - "Heavy" (if the box is heavy but not bulky)
     - "Both" (if the box is both bulky and heavy)
     - "Neither" (if the box is neither bulky nor heavy)

You need to implement a function `categorizeBox(length, width, height, mass)` that returns the appropriate category of the box.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Should the values for dimensions always be positive numbers?
2. Will the mass always be a positive number?
3. Are we allowed to assume the inputs are integers?

### Code

We'll use simple conditional checks to determine the category of the box.

### Strategy

1. Check if the box is "Bulky":
    - This can be done by comparing each dimension against \(10^4\) and calculating the volume.
2. Check if the box is "Heavy":
    - This can be done by directly comparing the mass to 100.
3. Use the results of the above checks to determine and return the category:
    - If both "Bulky" and "Heavy" are true, return "Both"
    - If only "Bulky" is true, return "Bulky"
    - If only "Heavy" is true, return "Heavy"
    - If neither is true, return "Neither"

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(1)\) since it involves a few constant-time comparisons and arithmetic operations.

```python
def categorizeBox(length, width, height, mass):
    bulky = length >= 10**4 or width >= 10**4 or height >= 10**4 or (length * width * height) >= 10**9
    heavy = mass >= 100

    if bulky and heavy:
        return "Both"
    elif bulky:
        return "Bulky"
    elif heavy:
        return "Heavy"
    else:
        return "Neither"
```

### Example

```python
# Example test cases
print(categorizeBox(10000, 2, 2, 50))    # Output: Bulky
print(categorizeBox(100, 100, 100, 150)) # Output: Heavy
print(categorizeBox(10000, 10000, 1, 200)) # Output: Both
print(categorizeBox(1, 1, 1, 1))         # Output: Neither
```

This code efficiently categorizes the box according to the given criteria using simple conditional checks.
