title:  Count the Number of Complete Components-out
permalink: /s2685

You are given a graph (possibly disconnected) that consists of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n-1`. A graph is a complete component if every pair of its nodes is connected by a direct edge. Count the number of complete components within the given graph.

The graph is given as an adjacency matrix represented as follows:

- `isConnected[i][j] = 1` if there's an edge between the nodes `i` and `j`.
- `isConnected[i][j] = 0` if there's no edge between nodes `i` and `j`.

**Input:**
- `isConnected`: a 2D list `n x n` where `n` is the number of nodes in the graph.

**Output:**
- An integer representing the number of complete components in the given graph.

## Clarifying Questions

To fully understand the problem, here are some clarifying questions and assumptions:

1. **Is the graph undirected?**
   - Yes, since `isConnected[i][j]` and `isConnected[j][i]` will both be `1` if there's an edge, the graph is undirected.

2. **Are there any constraints on the graph (like no self-loops)?**
   - There typically shouldn't be self-loops in a standard complete component.

3. **Can there be isolated nodes?**
   - Yes, isolated nodes aren't part of any component but are technically a complete component without any edges.

## Strategy

1. **DFS/BFS Traversal**: Use Depth First Search (DFS) or Breadth First Search (BFS) to identify all connected components in the graph.

2. **Check for Completeness**: For each connected component found, check if it is complete:
    - In a complete component of `k` nodes, there should be exactly `k*(k-1)/2` edges.

3. **Count Complete Components**: Keep a count of all complete components while traversing the entire graph.

## Code

Here is how we can implement the solution:

```python
def countCompleteComponents(isConnected):
    def dfs(node, visited, component):
        stack = [node]
        while stack:
            current = stack.pop()
            if current not in visited:
                visited.add(current)
                component.append(current)
                for neighbor in range(len(isConnected)):
                    if isConnected[current][neighbor] == 1 and neighbor not in visited:
                        stack.append(neighbor)
    
    n = len(isConnected)
    visited = set()
    completeComponentsCount = 0
    
    for node in range(n):
        if node not in visited:
            component = []
            dfs(node, visited, component)
            
            # Check for completeness
            isComplete = True
            for i in component:
                for j in component:
                    if i != j and isConnected[i][j] == 0:
                        isComplete = False
                        break
                if not isComplete:
                    break
            
            if isComplete:
                completeComponentsCount += 1
    
    return completeComponentsCount

# Example of usage
isConnected = [
    [1, 1, 0],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1]
]
print(countCompleteComponents(isConnected))
```

## Time Complexity

- **DFS/BFS Traversal**: O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
- **Checking for Completeness**: In the worst case, we might need to check all pairs within a component. If the component has k nodes, we need to check k*(k-1) pairs. Since there can be O(n) such nodes, this step is bounded by O(n^2).

Thus the overall time complexity can be approximated as **O(n^3)** in the worst case due to nested checking within the components and the DFS itself.

## Conclusion

This ensures we correctly identify and count all complete components in a given graph based on the adjacency matrix representation.
