title:  Recover a Tree From Preorder Traversal-out
permalink: /s1028
---

We are given a string representing a preorder traversal of a binary tree where:
- Nodes are represented by integers.
- Depth is indicated by the number of dashes before the integer indicating the node value.

For example, the input `'1-2--3--4-5--6--7'` represents a binary tree structured as follows:
```
    1
   / \
  2   5
 / \  / \
3   4 6  7
```

The task is to recover the tree from this preorder traversal and return the root of the tree.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints:** 
    - What is the depth limit of the tree?
    - Is the input guaranteed to be valid?

2. **Output constraints:** 
    - Should the tree nodes contain any specific properties other than the value?
    - In what format should the output (the root of the tree) be returned?

### Strategy

1. **Parsing the String:**
   - Read the input string and parse it into node values and their corresponding depths.
   - We can iterate through the string to determine how many dashes precede each integer to find out its depth level.

2. **Constructing the Tree:**
   - Use a stack to keep track of the nodes at each depth.
   - For each new node, adjust the stack to maintain the correct parent-child relationships based on depth.

3. **Helper Class Definition:**
   - Define a `TreeNode` class to create nodes for the binary tree.

4. **Preorder Construction:**
   - Given that preorder traversal is `root -> left -> right`, process nodes by depth, adding as children to the current parent when appropriate.

### Code

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def recoverFromPreorder(S: str) -> TreeNode:
    stack = []
    i = 0
    while i < len(S):
        level = 0
        # Count the dashes to determine the depth of the current node
        while i < len(S) and S[i] == '-':
            level += 1
            i += 1
        
        # Read the next number (node value)
        value = 0
        while i < len(S) and S[i].isdigit():
            value = value * 10 + int(S[i])
            i += 1
        
        # Create a new TreeNode with the value
        node = TreeNode(value)
        
        # Adjust the stack to the current level, which removes nodes not in the current depth's hierarchy
        while len(stack) > level:
            stack.pop()
        
        # Add the new node to the tree at the correct position
        if stack:
            if not stack[-1].left:
                stack[-1].left = node
            else:
                stack[-1].right = node
        
        # Push this node into the stack
        stack.append(node)
    
    # The root of the tree is the first element of the stack
    return stack[0]

```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the length of the input string.
  - We make a single pass through the input string.
  - Operations involving the stack (push and pop) are O(1).

- **Space Complexity:** O(N)
  - The stack will contain at most the number of nodes at the maximum depth of the tree, which in the worst case is proportional to the number of characters in the string.

This solution efficiently reconstructs the tree based on its preorder traversal with depth indications, producing the desired binary tree structure.
