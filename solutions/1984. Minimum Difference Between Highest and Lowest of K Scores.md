title:  Minimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest of K Scores-out
permalink: /s1984
---

You are given a list of scores of different students, `scores`, where `scores[i]` represents the score of the `i-th` student. You are also given an integer `k`, which represents the number of students to consider. Your task is to pick `k` scores from the list `scores` such that the difference between the highest and lowest scores in this subset is minimized. Return the minimum difference.

**Example:**

- Input: `scores = [90, 100, 78, 89, 67, 85]`, `k = 3`
- Output: 3
- Explanation: Pick scores [85, 89, 90], the difference between the highest and lowest scores is 90 - 85 = 5, which is the smallest possible difference.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we assume that `k` is always a valid integer (1 ≤ k ≤ len(scores))?**
   - Yes, you can assume that `k` is always valid.

2. **Is the list of scores always non-empty?**
   - Yes, the list of scores is always non-empty.

3. **Can the scores have duplicate values?**
   - Yes, scores can have duplicate values.

4. **How large can the input list `scores` be?**
   - The length of `scores` can be up to `10^5`.

## Strategy

The strategy to solve this problem involves sorting the list of scores and then using a sliding window of size `k` to find the minimum difference between the highest and lowest scores within any subset of `k` consecutive scores.

1. **Sort the list of scores.**
2. **Initialize the minimum difference to a large number (e.g., infinity).**
3. **Slide a window of size `k` over the sorted list:**
   - For each window, compute the difference between the highest and lowest scores (i.e., the difference between the first and the last element in the window).
   - Update the minimum difference.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum possible difference.

## Code

```python
from typing import List

def minimumDifference(scores: List[int], k: int) -> int:
    # Step 1: Sort the scores
    scores.sort()
    
    # Step 2: Initialize the minimum difference with a large value
    min_diff = float('inf')
    
    # Step 3: Slide a window of size k
    for i in range(len(scores) - k + 1):
        # Compute the difference between the current window's highest and lowest scores
        current_diff = scores[i + k - 1] - scores[i]
        # Update the minimum difference
        min_diff = min(min_diff, current_diff)
    
    return min_diff

# Example usage:
scores = [90, 100, 78, 89, 67, 85]
k = 3
print(minimumDifference(scores, k))  # Output: 5
```

## Time Complexity

- Sorting the list of scores takes **O(n log n)** where **n** is the length of the `scores`.
- The sliding window approach takes **O(n)** to find the minimum difference.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)**.

This solution is efficient and should work within the problem constraints.
