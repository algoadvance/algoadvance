LeetCode Problem 552: **Student Attendance Record II**

Given a positive integer `n`, return the number of possible attendance records of length `n` that do not contain more than one 'A' (absent) and do not contain three consecutive 'L' (late). The result may be large, so return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the valid characters that can appear in the attendance record?**
   - The characters are 'P' (present), 'L' (late), and 'A' (absent).

2. **What constraints should we keep in mind?**
   - A record cannot contain more than one 'A'.
   - A record cannot contain three consecutive 'L's.

3. **What is the maximum value of `n`?**
   - This isn't explicitly stated in the problem description, but typically, it could be as large as 10^4 based on common problem constraints in such problems.

### Strategy

The problem can be approached using Dynamic Programming. Let's define DP states to represent the number of valid sequences of length `i`:

- Let `P[i]` represent the number of sequences of length `i` that end with "P".
- Let `L[i]` represent the number of sequences of length `i` that end with "L" but not "LL".
- Let `LL[i]` represent the number of sequences of length `i` that end with "LL".

Combining these, we can easily derive the total number of sequences `S[i]`:
\[ S[i] = P[i] + L[i] + LL[i] \]

To account for the presence of 'A', we need to consider its position in the sequence, which can be anywhere from the start to the end. This significantly increases the number of valid sequences.

The recurrence relations are:
1. `P[i] = S[i-1]` (Any sequence of length `i-1` can be extended by 'P').
2. `L[i] = P[i-1]` (Because sequences ending in 'L' can't have more than one 'L' and must have previously ended in 'P').
3. `LL[i] = L[i-1]` (Similarly, sequences ending in 'LL' must have previously ended in exactly one 'L').

Using these relations, let's build the DP solution and handle the modulo operation as required.

### Code

Here is the Python code implementing the above strategy:

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def checkRecord(n: int) -> int:
    if n == 0:
        return 1
    
    dp_no_A = [0] * (n + 1)
    dp_no_A[0], dp_no_A[1] = 1, 2
    
    if n > 1:
        dp_no_A[2] = 4
        
    for i in range(3, n + 1):
        dp_no_A[i] = (dp_no_A[i - 1] + dp_no_A[i - 2] + dp_no_A[i - 3]) % MOD
    
    total = dp_no_A[n]
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        total += (dp_no_A[i - 1] * dp_no_A[n - i]) % MOD
        total %= MOD
    
    return total

# Sample Usage
print(checkRecord(2)) # Example input
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n)\) because we are using dynamic programming to populate our arrays up to `n` and then perform a sum over a subset of combinations which is managed within the same loop.

- Space Complexity: \(O(n)\) due to the storage of the DP array.
