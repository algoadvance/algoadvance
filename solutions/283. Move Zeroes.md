LeetCode Problem 283: Move Zeroes

Given an integer array `nums`, move all `0`s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size**:
    - What is the size range of the input array?
2. **Element Size**:
    - Can the array contain negative numbers, or is it only non-negative numbers?
3. **In-Place Requirement**:
    - Should the operation be performed in place?
4. **Return Value**:
    - Is the function supposed to return the modified array or should it modify the array in place without returning it?

### Code
```python
def moveZeroes(nums):
    """
    Move all 0's to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of non-zero elements.
    
    Args:
    nums (List[int]): List of integers.
    
    Returns:
    None: The function modifies the input list in place.
    """
    # Initialize the index for the place to move the next non-zero number
    last_non_zero_found_at = 0

    # First pass: move all non-zero elements to the 'last_non_zero_found_at' index
    for current in range(len(nums)):
        if nums[current] != 0:
            nums[last_non_zero_found_at] = nums[current]
            last_non_zero_found_at += 1

    # Second pass: fill the remaining positions with zeroes
    for current in range(last_non_zero_found_at, len(nums)):
        nums[current] = 0
```

### Strategy
1. **Initial Setup**:
    - We first initialize the `last_non_zero_found_at` index to 0. This will keep track of the position to place the next non-zero number.
2. **First Pass (Move Non-Zeroes)**:
    - We iterate through the array using an index `current`.
    - For every non-zero element encountered, we place it at the `last_non_zero_found_at` position and then increment `last_non_zero_found_at`.
3. **Second Pass (Fill Zeroes)**:
    - After placing all non-zero elements correctly, `last_non_zero_found_at` will be the index of the first position to fill with `0`.
    - We fill all remaining positions with `0` from `last_non_zero_found_at` to the end of the array.

### Time Complexity
- **First Pass**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. We traverse the array once to move non-zero elements to the front.
- **Second Pass**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. We traverse the array again to fill the remaining positions with zeros.
- **Overall**: O(n), as both passes involve traversing the array linearly.

This solution efficiently uses the in-place replacement strategy, ensuring minimal space usage and maintaining optimal time complexity.
