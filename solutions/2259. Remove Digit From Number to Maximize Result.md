title:  Remove Digit From Number to Maximize Result-out
permalink: /s2259
---

You are given a string `number` representing a **positive integer** and a character `digit`. You need to remove **exactly one occurrence** of the digit from the `number` so that the resulting string represents the **largest possible integer.** Return the resulting string.

#### Example
```
Input: number = "1231", digit = '1'
Output: "231"

Input: number = "551", digit = '5'
Output: "51"
```

#### Constraints
- `2 <= number.length <= 100`
- `number` consists of digits from '1' to '9'.
- `digit` is a digit from '1' to '9'.
- `digit` occurs at least once in `number`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are there any leading zeros in the number?
   **A:** No, since the number is always a positive integer, it will not have leading zeros.
   
2. **Q:** Are there multiple occurrences of `digit` in the number?
   **A:** Yes, there can be multiple occurrences and you need to find which occurrence to remove to maximize the resultant integer.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate Through the Number:**
   - We will iterate through each character in the `number`.
   
2. **Generate Possible Numbers:**
   - At each occurrence of `digit`, we will create a new string that omits that occurrence.
   - Keep track of these generated numbers.
   
3. **Find the Maximum:**
   - Compare the generated numbers and return the largest one.

### Code

Here is a Python solution for the problem:

```python
def removeDigit(number: str, digit: str) -> str:
    possible_results = []

    for i, num in enumerate(number):
        if num == digit:
            # Create a new number by omitting the current occurrence of the digit
            new_number = number[:i] + number[i+1:]
            possible_results.append(new_number)
    
    # Return the maximum of the possible results lexicographically
    return max(possible_results)

# Example Usage
print(removeDigit("1231", '1'))  # Output: "231"
print(removeDigit("551", '5'))   # Output: "51"
```

### Time Complexity

- **Iteration Through the Number:** O(n) where `n` is the length of the number.
- **Creating New Strings:** Each string creation is O(n) due to slicing.
  
The time complexity is **O(n^2)** in the worst case, where you have to slice strings multiple times. However, since the length of `number` is constrained to be at most 100, this is manageable.
