title:  Maximum Nesting Depth of Two Valid Parentheses Strings-out
permalink: /s1111
---

Given two strings `seq1` and `seq2`, both of which are valid parentheses sequences, your task is to return a pair of integers `(depth1, depth2)`, where `depth1` is the maximum nesting depth of subsequence of `seq1` and `depth2` is the maximum nesting depth of subsequence of `seq2`. The subsequence can be derived by deleting some characters of the original string without changing the relative order of the remaining characters.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the definition of the depth of valid parentheses?**
   - The depth of a valid parentheses string is the maximum number of 'open' operations minus the number of 'close' operations you encounter at any point in the string. For example, the depth of the string `"((()))"` is 3.

2. **Are we guaranteed that both `seq1` and `seq2` are valid parentheses sequences?**
   - Yes, both `seq1` and `seq2` are valid parentheses sequences.

3. **Is there a limit to the length of `seq1` and `seq2`?**
   - There are usually constraints in the problem that specify the maximum length of the strings, but in absence of such constraints, you can typically assume a reasonable limit, like 10^5 for most problems.

### Strategy

1. **Calculate the maximum nesting depth for the given sequence**:
   - Initialize a counter to zero. 
   - Iterate through each character in the sequence:
     - Increment the counter for an opening parenthesis `'('`.
     - Decrement the counter for a closing parenthesis `')'`.
     - Track the maximum value of the counter during the iteration.
   - The maximum value of the counter at any point gives the maximum depth of the sequence.

2. **Apply this process to both `seq1` and `seq2`**:
   - By iterating over `seq1`, calculate `depth1`.
   - By iterating over `seq2`, calculate `depth2`.

### Code

```python
def maxDepth(seq1: str, seq2: str) -> tuple:
    def calculate_depth(seq: str) -> int:
        depth = 0
        max_depth = 0
        for char in seq:
            if char == '(':
                depth += 1
                max_depth = max(max_depth, depth)
            elif char == ')':
                depth -= 1
        return max_depth
    
    depth1 = calculate_depth(seq1)
    depth2 = calculate_depth(seq2)
    
    return (depth1, depth2)

# Example usage:
seq1 = "(()(())())"
seq2 = "((())())"
print(maxDepth(seq1, seq2))  # Output: (3, 3)
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n + m)**, where:
- `n` is the length of `seq1`.
- `m` is the length of `seq2`.

This is because each sequence is traversed once, making the solution linear with respect to the total length of the input strings.
