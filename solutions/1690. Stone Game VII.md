title:  Stone Game VII-out

---
Alice and Bob take turns playing a game with Alice starting first. There are `n` stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, they can remove either the leftmost or rightmost stone from the row and receive points equal to the sum of the remaining stones' values.

The game's objective for Alice and Bob is to maximize their score difference, which is calculated as (Total points collected by Alice) - (Total points collected by Bob).

Assume that both players play optimally.

Write a function `stoneGameVII(stones: List[int]) -> int` that returns the maximum score difference Alice can achieve if both play optimally.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What is the range of values for `n`?
   **A:** The length `n` can range from 1 to 1000.

2. **Q:** What about the values of the stones?
   **A:** Each value in the stones array can range from 1 to 1000.

3. **Q:** Is the score difference always non-negative?
   **A:** Yes, since we are calculating the maximum score difference Alice can achieve and assuming both players play optimally.

### Strategy
1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:** Use a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum score difference starting from the `i`-th to the `j`-th stone.
    - `prefix_sum[i]` can be used to compute the sum of any subarray of stones in constant time.
    - For `i <= j`, Alice can choose either the leftmost or rightmost stone. The resultant game state will then depend on Bob's optimal move, which should minimize Alice's advantage.

2. Initialization:
    - When `i == j`, there's no move possible, so `dp[i][i] = 0`.

3. State Transition:
    - `dp[i][j] = max(sum(i+1, j) - dp[i+1][j], sum(i, j-1) - dp[i][j-1])`
    - Here `sum(i, j)` is the sum of stones from index `i` to `j`.

### Code

```python
def stoneGameVII(stones):
    n = len(stones)
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Compute prefix sums to quickly get range sums
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + stones[i]
    
    # Create and initialize the DP table
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Fill the table
    for length in range(2, n + 1):   # length of the subarray
        for i in range(n - length + 1):
            j = i + length - 1
            # Get the sum of stones from index i to index j
            current_sum = prefix_sum[j + 1] - prefix_sum[i]
            # Calculate dp[i][j]
            dp[i][j] = max(current_sum - stones[i] - dp[i + 1][j],
                           current_sum - stones[j] - dp[i][j - 1])
                           
    return dp[0][n - 1]

# Example usage
stones = [5, 3, 1, 4, 2]
print(stoneGameVII(stones))  # Output: 6
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2) due to the nested loops filling the DP table.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n^2) for storing the DP table and prefix sum array.
