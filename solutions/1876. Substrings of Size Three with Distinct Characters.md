title:  Substrings of Size Three with Distinct Characters-out
permalink: /s1876
---

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within the string. We want to count the number of substrings of size three with distinct characters.

**Example:**
- Input: `s = "xyzzaz"`
- Output: 1
- Explanation: The only valid substring is "xyz".

**Example:**
- Input: `s = "aababcabc"`
- Output: 4
- Explanation: Valid substrings are "abc", "bca", "cab", and "abc".

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Length:** What is the maximum length of the input string `s`?
2. **Character Set:** Are the characters only lowercase English letters?
3. **Edge Cases:** What should be the output if the string length is less than 3?
   
## Strategy
1. **Iterate through Substrings:** Loop through the string and extract substrings of length 3.
2. **Check Distinct Characters:** For each substring, check if all characters are distinct.
3. **Count Valid Substrings:** Maintain a count of substrings that meet the criteria.

### Implementation Steps
1. Initialize a counter to 0.
2. Use a loop to extract substrings of length 3 starting from each index except the last two.
3. Use a set to check if all characters in the substring are unique.
4. Increment the counter if the characters are unique.
5. Return the counter.

## Code
Hereâ€™s how you can implement the solution in Python:

```python
def countGoodSubstrings(s: str) -> int:
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s) - 2):
        substr = s[i:i+3]
        if len(set(substr)) == 3:
            count += 1
    return count
```

## Time Complexity
- The loop runs `n - 2` times (where `n` is the length of the string), and on each iteration, creating the substring and checking its characters for uniqueness takes a constant time (since we are handling substrings of a fixed length, 3).
- **Overall Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of valid substrings of length 3 with distinct characters.
