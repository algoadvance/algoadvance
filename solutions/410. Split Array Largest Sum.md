title:  Split Array Largest Sum-out
permalink: /s410
---

Given an array `nums` consisting of `n` non-negative integers and an integer `m`, you need to split the array into `m` non-empty continuous subarrays. Write an algorithm to minimize the largest sum among these `m` subarrays.

### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [7,2,5,10,8], m = 2
Output: 18
Explanation:
There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8],
where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], m = 2
Output: 9
Explanation:
There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
The best way is to split it into [1,2,3] and [4,5],
where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 9.
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`
- `1 <= m <= min(50, nums.length)`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the elements of `nums` always non-negative?
2. Can the subarrays be of different lengths?
3. Can the minimum possible largest sum exceed the sum of all elements in the array?

---

## Strategy

The problem can be treated using a binary search combined with a greedy approach:

1. **Binary Search for the Answer:**
   The minimum possible value for the largest sum is the maximum element in the array (`max(nums)`), as this would be the minimum "largest sum" if we had `m` subarrays available for each element.
   
   The maximum possible value for the largest sum would be the sum of all elements in `nums` (`sum(nums)`), as this would be the situation if we only had one subarray (i.e., `m = 1`).

2. **Binary Search Boundaries:**
   - Set `low` to `max(nums)`.
   - Set `high` to `sum(nums)`.

3. **Greedy Validation:**
   For a candidate largest sum `mid` (the midpoint in the current binary search range), check if it's feasible to split `nums` such that the largest subarray sum is less than or equal to `mid`:
   - Traverse through the array while summing the elements.
   - When the current sum exceeds `mid`, increment the subarray count and reset the current sum to the current element.
   - Ensure you don't exceed `m` subarrays.

4. **Adjust Binary Search Range:**
   - If the subarray count exceeds `m`, increase `low` to `mid + 1` as we need a larger possible largest sum.
   - Otherwise, adjust `high` to `mid`.

5. Continue until `low` equals `high`, which will be the minimized largest sum.

## Code

```python
def splitArray(nums, m):
    def is_valid(mid):
        subarray_count = 1
        current_sum = 0
        for num in nums:
            current_sum += num
            if current_sum > mid:
                subarray_count += 1
                current_sum = num
                if subarray_count > m:
                    return False
        return True

    low, high = max(nums), sum(nums)
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if is_valid(mid):
            high = mid
        else:
            low = mid + 1
    
    return low

# Example usage:
nums = [7, 2, 5, 10, 8]
m = 2
print(splitArray(nums, m))  # Output: 18
```

## Time Complexity

- **Binary Search Range Setup:** `O(n)` to calculate `low` and `high`.
- **Binary Search Steps:** `O(log(sum(nums) - max(nums)))`.
- **Greedy Validation per Binary Search Step:** `O(n)`.

Hence, the total time complexity is `O(n * log(sum(nums) - max(nums)))`. This is efficient given the constraints.
