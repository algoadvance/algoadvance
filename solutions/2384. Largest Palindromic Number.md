title:  Largest Palindromic Number-out
permalink: /s2384
---

You are given a string `num` consisting of digits only. You need to construct the largest palindromic number (which is also a string) that can be formed using the digits of `num`. The digits can be rearranged, and leading zeros are not allowed unless the computed palindromic number is `0` itself.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input string `num` be empty?**
   - No, the problem typically assumes that `num` is a non-empty string.

2. **How do we handle cases where no palindromic number can be formed?**
   - It is always possible to form a palindromic number with at least one digit.

3. **Are there any constraints on the length of the input string `num`?**
   - The length of `num` will be within known constraints suitable for typical leetcode problems.

## Strategy

To form the largest palindromic number, we need to:
1. Count the frequency of each digit.
2. Determine the largest possible palindromic structure:
   - Use the most frequent digits for symmetric halves.
   - Optionally use a digit with an odd count of occurrences in the center (if applicable).

### Steps:
1. Count the frequency of each digit in the given string.
2. Determine the largest possible string for the first half of the palindrome by arranging digits from highest to lowest.
3. Create the second half by reversing the first half.
4. If there's a digit with an odd frequency that can be placed in the middle, insert it.
5. Avoid leading zeros unless the palindrome is zero.

## Code

```python
def largestPalindromic(num: str) -> str:
    from collections import Counter
    
    # Step 1: Count the frequency of each digit
    digit_count = Counter(num)
    
    # Step 2: Initialize variables
    first_half = []
    middle_digit = ''
    
    # Step 3: Construct the first half of the palindrome
    for digit in '9876543210':
        if digit not in digit_count:
            continue
        freq = digit_count[digit]
        if freq % 2 == 1:
            middle_digit = max(middle_digit, digit)
        first_half.append(digit * (freq // 2))
    
    # Step 4: Merge the first half parts and form the complete string
    first_half = ''.join(first_half)
    second_half = first_half[::-1]
    if first_half == '' and middle_digit == '':  # No digits could be used
        return '0'

    largest_palindrome = first_half + middle_digit + second_half
    
    # Handle leading zero, ensure largest palindrome
    if largest_palindrome[0] == '0': 
        return '0'
    
    return largest_palindrome

# Example usage:
print(largestPalindromic("9876543210"))
```

## Time Complexity

- **Step 1 (Counting frequency):** O(n) where n is the length of the input string `num`.
- **Step 2 (Initialize variables):** O(1) as it is setting up structures.
- **Step 3 (Construct the first half):** O(1) since the digit range is fixed (0-9).
- **Step 4 (Merge parts and final checks):** O(n).

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, which is efficient and suitable for the given problem constraints.
