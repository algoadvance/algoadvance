title:  Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length-out
permalink: /s1456
---

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, return the maximum number of vowel letters in any substring of `s` with length `k`.

**Vowels** in English are `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, and `'u'`.

You need to implement a function `maxVowels(s: str, k: int) -> int`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Will the string `s` always contain at least `k` characters?
   - Is `s` guaranteed to only contain lowercase English letters?

2. **Output Specifications:**
   - Should the function return an integer representing the maximum number of vowels?

Assuming standard problem constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= k <= s.length`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the sliding window technique:

1. **Sliding Window Approach**:
   - Initialize a window of size `k` on the string `s`.
   - Count the number of vowels in this initial window.
   - Slide the window one character to the right at a time.
   - As you slide, subtract the impact of the character that is left out of the window and add the impact of the new character that enters the window.
   - Keep track of the maximum number of vowels seen as you slide the window across `s`.

This method ensures that we only traverse the string once, making it efficient.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because each character is processed a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are only using a fixed amount of extra space (for the vowel set and counters).

### Code

```python
def maxVowels(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    # Set of vowels
    vowels = {'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'}
    
    # Initial vowel count in the first window of size `k`
    vowel_count = sum(1 for char in s[:k] if char in vowels)
    max_vowel_count = vowel_count
    
    # Using the sliding window technique
    for i in range(k, len(s)):
        if s[i] in vowels:
            vowel_count += 1
        if s[i - k] in vowels:
            vowel_count -= 1
        max_vowel_count = max(max_vowel_count, vowel_count)
    
    return max_vowel_count
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a set of vowels for quick lookup.
   - Compute the number of vowels in the initial window of size `k`.

2. **Sliding the Window**:
   - Loop from the `k`-th character to the end of the string.
   - Adjust the `vowel_count` by removing the impact of the character that is no longer in the window and adding the impact of the new character.
   - Keep track of the maximum number of vowels seen during this process.

This approach ensures an efficient and clean solution to the problem.
