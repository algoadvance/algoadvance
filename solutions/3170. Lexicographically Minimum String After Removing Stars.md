title:  Lexicographically Minimum String After Removing Stars-out
permalink: /s3170
---

Given a string `s` containing only lowercase letters and stars (`*`). In one operation, you can remove any star from `s` and the letter immediately before it. You must remove all the stars and the letters that precede them, and return the lexicographically smallest string you can obtain after doing this.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input string contain consecutive stars?**
    - Yes, consecutive stars are possible and each star removes its immediately preceding character.

2. **Is the input guaranteed to have a valid configuration where every star has a preceding letter to remove?**
    - Yes, every star will always have a preceding letter according to the problem statement.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can utilize a stack data structure:

1. **Use a Stack**: 
    - Traverse through each character in the string.
    - If the character is a letter, push it onto the stack.
    - If the character is a star (`*`), pop the top element from the stack (which would be the letter to be removed).
2. **Construct the Result String**:
    - After processing all characters, the stack will contain the letters that have not been removed.
    - Convert the stack to a string to get the final result.

## Time Complexity

- The solution involves a single pass over the string and operations on the stack, which are both O(1) for push and pop operations. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`.

## Code

```python
def removeStars(s: str) -> str:
    stack = []
    
    for char in s:
        if char == '*':
            if stack:
                stack.pop()  # Remove the preceding character
        else:
            stack.append(char)  # Add the letter to the stack
    
    # The remaining stack contains the answer
    return ''.join(stack)

# Example usage:
s = "leet**cod*e"
result = removeStars(s)
print(result)  # Output should be "lecoe"
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: Create an empty stack.
2. **Traversal**:
    - For each character:
        - If it's a letter, push it onto the stack.
        - If itâ€™s a star (`*`), pop the top of the stack (remove the most recent letter).
3. **Result Construction**: Convert the stack to a string by joining the characters.

This approach ensures that we handle each character in the string efficiently and obtain the lexicographically smallest string after removing all stars and their preceding letters.
