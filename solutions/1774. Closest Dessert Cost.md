title:  Closest Dessert Cost-out
permalink: /s1774
---

You would like to make dessert and are preparing to buy the ingredients. You have `n` ice cream base costs, represented by an array `baseCosts` and at most `m` topping costs, represented by an array `toppingCosts`.

You want to make dessert with a total cost as close as possible to the `target` cost. It is possible to use one, no, or two of each topping. You want to find the total cost of the dessert closest to `target`.

Return the closest possible cost of the dessert.

Example:
```
Input: baseCosts = [1, 7], toppingCosts = [3, 4], target = 10
Output: 10
Explanation: You can use baseCost 7 and toppingCost 3 to get 7 + 3 = 10.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the base cost be zero or negative?**
   - No, base costs are all positive integers.
2. **Can the topping costs be zero or negative?**
   - No, topping costs are all non-negative integers.
3. **How do we handle ties?**
   - If there is a tie, choose the lower total cost.
4. **What are the constraints or limits on the lengths of baseCosts and toppingCosts?**
   - Typically, lengths of `baseCosts` and `toppingCosts` can be up to 10 each, keeping the overall time complexity manageable.

## Strategy

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Start with the base cost.
   - For each topping, we can use it 0, 1, or 2 times.

2. **Recursive Approach:**
   - Explore all combinations using Depth-First Search (DFS) to either add 0, 1, or 2 units of each topping.
   - Keep track of the closest sum during the exploration.

3. **Backtracking:**
   - Use backtracking to efficiently explore all possible topping combinations starting from each base cost.

4. **Early Termination:**
   - If we find an exact match to the target, return immediately.

## Code

```python
def closestCost(baseCosts, toppingCosts, target):
    from functools import lru_cache

    @lru_cache(None)
    def dfs(i, current_cost):
        nonlocal closest
        if abs(closest - target) > abs(current_cost - target):
            closest = current_cost
        elif abs(closest - target) == abs(current_cost - target) and current_cost < closest:
            closest = current_cost
        
        if i == len(toppingCosts):
            return
        
        # Recurse by choosing 0, 1, or 2 of the current topping
        for add in (0, 1, 2):
            new_cost = current_cost + add * toppingCosts[i]
            if new_cost <= target + abs(target - closest):
                dfs(i + 1, new_cost)
    
    closest = float('inf')
    for base in baseCosts:
        dfs(0, base)
    
    return closest

# Example Usage
print(closestCost([1, 7], [3, 4], 10))  # Output: 10
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity is determined by the number of choices at each step. For each topping, we have 3 choices (0, 1, or 2 times). If there are `m` toppings, the possible combinations are `3^m`.
- Since we are using DFS with memoization, the worst case is `O(n * 3^m)`, where `n` is the number of base costs and `m` is the number of toppings.
- Given that both `n` and `m` are typically small (< 10), this complexity is manageable within these constraints.

This solution efficiently explores all possible combinations to find the closest possible dessert cost.
