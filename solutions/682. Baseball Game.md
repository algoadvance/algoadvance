You are keeping score for a baseball game with strange rules. The game consists of several rounds, where the scores of past rounds may affect future scores.

At the start of the game, you are given an empty record. You are given a list of strings `ops`, where `ops[i]` is the `i-th` operation you must apply to the record and is one of the following:

1. An integer `x` - Record a new score of `x`.
2. `"+"` - Record a new score that is the sum of the previous two scores.
3. `"D"` - Record a new score that is double the previous score.
4. `"C"` - Invalidate the previous score, removing it from the record.

Return the sum of all scores on the record after applying all the operations.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Q:** What should we do if the input list `ops` is empty?
   **A:** If the input list `ops` is empty, the sum of scores should be 0 as there are no operations to perform.
   
2. **Q:** Can we assume the input list `ops` will always be valid and contain valid operations?
   **A:** Yes, we can assume that the input list will always be valid according to the given rules.

### Strategy:
1. Initialize an empty list `record` to keep track of the scores.
2. Iterate through each operation in the list `ops`.
   - If the operation is an integer `x`, append `x` to `record`.
   - If the operation is `"+"`, append the sum of the last two scores in `record`.
   - If the operation is `"D"`, append double the last score in `record`.
   - If the operation is `"C"`, remove the last score from `record`.
3. Finally, return the sum of all scores in `record`.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of operations, because we process each operation once.
- The space complexity is also **O(n)** for storing the scores in the list `record`.

### Code:
Here's a Python function for the solution:

```python
def calPoints(ops):
    record = []
    for op in ops:
        if op == "+":
            record.append(record[-1] + record[-2])
        elif op == "D":
            record.append(2 * record[-1])
        elif op == "C":
            record.pop()
        else:
            record.append(int(op))
    return sum(record)

# Test cases
print(calPoints(["5", "2", "C", "D", "+"]))  # Output: 30
print(calPoints(["5", "-2", "4", "C", "D", "9", "+", "+"]))  # Output: 27
print(calPoints(["1"]))  # Output: 1
```

In these test cases:
- For `["5", "2", "C", "D", "+"]`, the expected output is `30`.
- For `["5", "-2", "4", "C", "D", "9", "+", "+"]`, the expected output is `27`.
- For `["1"]`, the expected output is `1`.
