title:  Count of Smaller Numbers After Self-out
permalink: /s315
---
You are given an integer array `nums` and you have to return a new counts array where `counts[i]` is the number of smaller elements to the right of `nums[i]`.

```python
def countSmaller(nums):
    # Your implementation here
    pass
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Range**: What is the size of the array? Can it be empty? 
   - Yes, the array size can range from 0 to 100,000.
2. **Element Range**: What is the range of values within the array?
   - The values within the array can range from `-10^4` to `10^4`.
3. **Output Format**: What should be the format of the output?
   - The output should be a list of integers representing the counts of smaller numbers to the right.

### Strategy:
To solve this problem efficiently, we cannot use a simple nested loop as it would lead to an O(nÂ²) time complexity, which is not feasible for large arrays. Instead, we can use a modified version of merge sort to count the smaller elements more efficiently.

**Merge Sort Strategy**:
1. **Modification**: Modify the merge sort to count the number of smaller elements for each element as it gets merged.
2. **Divide & Conquer**: Split the array into two halves and sort each half recursively while counting the inversions.
3. **Merge**: During the merge process, count how many elements in the right half are smaller than the current element of the left half.

### Code:

```python
def countSmaller(nums):
    if not nums:
        return []
    
    def sort(enum):
        mid = len(enum) // 2
        if mid:
            left, right = sort(enum[:mid]), sort(enum[mid:])
            for i in range(len(enum)-1, -1, -1):
                if not right or left and left[-1][1] > right[-1][1]:
                    smaller[left[-1][0]] += len(right)
                    enum[i] = left.pop()
                else:
                    enum[i] = right.pop()
        return enum

    smaller = [0] * len(nums)
    sort(list(enumerate(nums)))
    return smaller

# Test the function with an example input
print(countSmaller([5, 2, 6, 1]))  # Expected output: [2, 1, 1, 0]
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Base Case**: If `nums` is empty, return an empty list.
2. **Sort Function - Enumerate**: Use enumerate to keep track of the original indices of the elements as we need to place the counts in their original positions.
3. **Recursive Sort**: Perform a modified merge sort on the enumerated array.
4. **Counting**: During the merging process, count how many elements from the right side are smaller than the current element from the left side. Keep accumulating these counts in the `smaller` array.
5. **Join Left and Right**: Merge the sorted left and right arrays appropriately.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n)
  - The merge sort algorithm operates with a time complexity of O(n log n), and the additional operations for counting smaller elements do not exceed this complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - We use additional space for the `smaller` array and the enumerated list.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count the smaller elements on the right for each element, even for larger input sizes.
