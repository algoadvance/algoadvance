title:  Snakes and Ladders-out
permalink: /s909
---

You are given a `n x n` integer matrix `board` where the cells are filled with either numbers or `-1`. The numbers in the cells represent ladders and snakes, such that:

- A positive number `board[i][j] = k` indicates there's a ladder from cell `(i, j)` to cell `k`.
- A `-1` means there is neither a snake nor a ladder at `(i, j)`.

Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to reach the last cell, i.e., `n*n` starting from cell `1`. You can only move forward from your current cell `x` to `x + i` where `1 <= i <= 6` (like rolling a 6-faced die). If you encounter a snake or ladder, you must move to the destination cell as represented on the board.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Format of Input and Output**:
    - Input: `board` (list of lists of integers)
    - Output: Integer representing the minimum number of moves to reach the last cell

2. **Board Layout**:
    - The board cells are numbered from `1` to `n^2`, starting from the bottom-left corner and alternating directions row by row.

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - Ensure the board can handle n x n where n can vary.
    - Some cells may not have snakes or ladders.

## Strategy

1. **Transform the Board**: Convert the 2D board representation into a 1D array to simplify access to cells. The mapping is non-trivial since row directions alternate.
   
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
    - Initialize a queue with the starting cell (cell 1).
    - At each step, simulate rolling a die (explore the next 6 possible moves).
    - Check if the destination cell is beyond the board's maximum cell.
    - Use a visited set to avoid re-visiting cells.
    - Continue until the last cell is reached.

## Code

```python
from collections import deque

def snakes_and_ladders(board):
    n = len(board)
    
    def get_position(square):
        """Convert the square number to board coordinates"""
        quot, rem = divmod(square - 1, n)
        row = n - 1 - quot
        col = rem if row % 2 != n % 2 else n - 1 - rem
        return row, col
    
    visited = set()
    queue = deque([(1, 0)])  # (current cell, moves)
    
    while queue:
        current, moves = queue.popleft()
        for dice in range(1, 7):
            next_square = current + dice
            if next_square > n*n:
                continue
            row, col = get_position(next_square)
            if board[row][col] != -1:
                next_square = board[row][col]
            if next_square == n*n:
                return moves + 1
            if next_square not in visited:
                visited.add(next_square)
                queue.append((next_square, moves + 1))
    
    return -1

# Example Usage:
# board = [
#     [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1],
#     [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1],
#     [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1],
#     [-1, 35, -1, -1, 13, -1],
#     [-1, -1, -1, -1, -1, -1],
#     [-1, 15, -1, -1, -1, -1]
# ]
# print(snakes_and_ladders(board))  # Output: 4
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n^2) \) 
  - Each cell is processed at most once, given that we keep track of visited cells.
  - There are \( n \times n \) cells, thus the algorithm will run in proportional time.

- **Space Complexity**: \( O(n^2) \) 
  - Space required for the queue and the visited set.
