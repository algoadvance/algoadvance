You are given a `rows x cols` matrix `grid` representing a field of cherries where `grid[r][c]` represents the number of cherries that you can collect from the cell `(r, c)`.

You have two robots that start at `(0, 0)` and `(0, cols-1)` on the first row. Return the maximum number of cherries collection using both robots by following the rules below:

- From a cell `(r, c)`, robots can move to `(r + 1, c - 1)`, `(r + 1, c)`, or `(r + 1, c + 1)`.
- When any robot is visiting a cell `(r, c)`, it collects all cherries, and any cell can be visited by at most one robot.
- Both robots should reach the bottom row of the grid.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Can the grid contain negative numbers or obstacles?**
   - No, the grid contains only non-negative integers representing the number of cherries.

2. **Is the grid guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, according to the problem constraints, the grid is guaranteed to be non-empty.

3. **What should be returned if the grid has only one row?**
   - If there's only one row, the robots can only collect cherries from their starting positions.

### Strategy:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:** We need to optimize the robot movements to maximize cherry pickup using dynamic programming.
  
2. **State Definition:** Define `dp[r][c1][c2]` as the maximum cherries both robots can collect starting from position `(r, c1)` for Robot 1 and `(r, c2)` for Robot 2 until the bottom of the grid.
   
3. **State Transition:**
   - From `dp[r][c1][c2]`, we can move to `dp[r+1][new_c1][new_c2]` where `new_c1` and `new_c2` are the new column positions for the robots and can be from their current positions +/- 1 and within the grid bounds.

4. **Implementation Steps:**
   - We iterate from the bottom of the grid to the top.
   - Initialize the DP array for the bottom row.
   - For each cell, compute the possible moves for both robots and update the DP values accordingly.

5. **Result Extraction:** The result will be found in `dp[0][0][cols - 1]` which represents starting from the first row with given starting positions of the robots.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity is \(O(rows \times cols^2 \times 3^2)\) since for every cell and positions, we have 9 possible moves combinations to consider. The space complexity can be optimized to \(O(cols^2)\) due to the use of rolling arrays.

### Code:

```python
def cherryPickup(grid):
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    dp = [[[0] * cols for _ in range(cols)] for _ in range(rows)]
    
    # Initialize the dp array for the bottom row
    for c1 in range(cols):
        for c2 in range(cols):
            if c1 == c2:
                dp[rows - 1][c1][c2] = grid[rows - 1][c1]
            else:
                dp[rows - 1][c1][c2] = grid[rows - 1][c1] + grid[rows - 1][c2]
    
    # Bottom-up DP
    for r in range(rows - 2, -1, -1):
        for c1 in range(cols):
            for c2 in range(cols):
                max_cherries = 0
                for new_c1 in [c1 - 1, c1, c1 + 1]:
                    for new_c2 in [c2 - 1, c2, c2 + 1]:
                        if 0 <= new_c1 < cols and 0 <= new_c2 < cols:
                            max_cherries = max(
                                max_cherries, dp[r + 1][new_c1][new_c2]
                            )
                if c1 == c2:
                    dp[r][c1][c2] = grid[r][c1] + max_cherries
                else:
                    dp[r][c1][c2] = grid[r][c1] + grid[r][c2] + max_cherries

    # The result will be the starting position (0, 0) and (0, cols-1)
    return dp[0][0][cols - 1]

# Example usage
grid = [
    [3, 1, 1],
    [2, 5, 1],
    [1, 5, 5],
    [2, 1, 1]
]
print(cherryPickup(grid))  # Output should be 24
```
This implementation ensures that both robots collect the maximum cherries by considering all possible moves efficiently using dynamic programming.
