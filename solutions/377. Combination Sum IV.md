title:  Combination Sum IV-out
permalink: /s377
---
Given an array of distinct integers `nums` and a target integer `target`, return the number of possible combinations that add up to `target`.

The order of the numbers in the combination matters.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the numbers in `nums` be negative?**
   No, all numbers in `nums` are positive integers.

2. **Can we use the same number multiple times in a combination?**
   Yes, numbers from `nums` can be reused any number of times.

3. **What is the range of the length of `nums` and the value of `target`?**
   - `1 <= nums.length <= 200`
   - `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
   - `1 <= target <= 1000`

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to define a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the number of combinations that sum up to `i`.

1. Initialize `dp[0]` to 1, because there is one way to get a sum of 0, which is to choose nothing.
2. For each number `i` from 1 to `target`, compute `dp[i]` by iterating through each number in `nums`. If `i - num >= 0`, then add `dp[i - num]` to `dp[i]`.
3. The result will be in `dp[target]`.

### Code
```python
def combinationSum4(nums, target):
    dp = [0] * (target + 1)
    dp[0] = 1  # There's one way to make a target sum of 0.
    
    for i in range(1, target + 1):
        for num in nums:
            if i - num >= 0:
                dp[i] += dp[i - num]
    
    return dp[target]

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 2, 3]
target = 4
print(combinationSum4(nums, target))  # Output: 7
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n \times \text{target})\), where \(n\) is the length of `nums`. This is because we have two nested loops: one iterating over each value from 1 to `target`, and another iterating over each integer in `nums`.

### Summary
By using dynamic programming, we are able to store the number of combinations for each possible target sum up to the given `target`, allowing us to efficiently compute the result.
