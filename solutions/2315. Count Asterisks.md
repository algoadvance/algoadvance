title:  Count Asterisks-out
permalink: /s2315
---
You are given a string `s` that contains some characters and/or asterisks (`'*'`). You are required to count the number of asterisks (`'*'`) that are not enclosed between pairs of pipe (`'|'`) characters.

More formally, the asterisks to be counted are not:

- Between a pair of pipe characters `|` that contains zero or more pipe characters.

Example:

- Input: `s = "l|*e*et|c**o|*de|"`
- Output: `2`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What characters can the string `s` contain?** 
   - The string can contain any ASCII character.
2. **Can the string contain an odd number of pipe characters?**
   - Yes, the string can contain an odd number of pipe characters, which means all characters after the last `|` should be taken into account.
3. **Is it guaranteed that the input string will be non-empty?**
   - Yes, we can assume the input string `s` is non-empty.

## Strategy
1. Use a flag to track whether we are currently between a pair of pipe characters.
2. Initialize a counter to count the valid asterisks (i.e., asterisks not between `|` pairs).
3. Traverse through the string character by character:
   - Toggle the flag whenever a pipe character is encountered.
   - Increment the counter when an asterisk is encountered if the flag is not set.
4. Return the counter.

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`, as we need to traverse the entire string once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we are using only a few extra variables regardless of the input size.

## Code

Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def countAsterisks(s: str) -> int:
    inside_pipes = False
    asterisk_count = 0
    
    for char in s:
        if char == '|':
            inside_pipes = not inside_pipes
        elif char == '*' and not inside_pipes:
            asterisk_count += 1
            
    return asterisk_count

# Example usage:
s = "l|*e*et|c**o|*de|"
print(countAsterisks(s))  # Output: 2
```

This implementation correctly counts the number of asterisks that are not enclosed between any pairs of pipe characters.
