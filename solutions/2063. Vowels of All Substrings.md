title:  Vowels of All Substrings-out
permalink: /s2063
---

Given a string `word`, return the sum of the number of vowels (`'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, `'u'`) in every substring of `word`.

**Example:**
```
Input: word = "aba"
Output: 6
Explanation: 
The substrings of "aba" are:
"a", "b", "a", "ab", "ba", and "aba".
- "a" has 1 vowel.
- "b" has 0 vowels.
- "a" has 1 vowel.
- "ab" has 1 vowel.
- "ba" has 1 vowel.
- "aba" has 2 vowels.
Therefore, 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What will be the maximum length of the input string `word`?**
   - Assuming it can go up to \( n \) where \( n \leq 10^5 \).

2. **Are substrings considered as continuous sequences of characters from the original string?**
   - Yes, substrings are continuous sequences.

3. **Are there any special characters or is it just lowercase letters?**
   - The problem statement implies it is just lowercase English letters.

### Strategy

1. **Counting Vowels Efficiently:**
    - We need to count the number of vowels in all possible substrings.
    - We can directly see that iterating over all substrings and counting vowels would be highly inefficient \((O(n^3))\).

2. **Mathematical Insight:**
    - For each vowel at position `i` (0-based index), it contributes to multiple substrings. Specifically:
        - From positions `(0, i)`, `(i+1, n-1)`.
        - Each vowel at position `i` appears in \( i + 1 \) substrings starting before it and \( n - i \) substrings ending after it.
        - Thus, the total contribution of the vowel at position `i` is \((i+1) \times (n-i)\).

3. **Sum of Contributions:**
    - We iterate through the string, for each vowel, calculate its total contribution, and sum these contributions.

### Code

```python
def countVowels(word: str) -> int:
    n = len(word)
    vowels = set('aeiou')
    total_vowels = 0

    for i in range(n):
        if word[i] in vowels:
            total_vowels += (i + 1) * (n - i)

    return total_vowels

# Example usage:
print(countVowels("aba")) # Output: 6
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \).
  - We make a single pass through the string, checking if each character is a vowel and then calculating its contribution.
  
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(1) \).
  - Only a few extra variables are used for calculations.

This ensures we have a highly efficient solution that handles the worst-case scenario efficiently.
