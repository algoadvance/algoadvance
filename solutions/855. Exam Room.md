An exam room is a linear array of seats numbered from `0` to `N-1` (inclusive). Students enter the room one at a time and choose seats based on the following logic:
- A student tries to sit as far away from any other student as possible.
- If there are multiple such seats, the student sits in the lowest-numbered one.

Implement the `ExamRoom` class:
- `ExamRoom(int N)` initializes the object with `N` seats.
- `int seat()` returns the seat index at which the next student will sit.
- `void leave(int p)` indicates that the student in seat `p` leaves the room. It is guaranteed that the given seat `p` will be occupied.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What constraints on the number of students and seats should I be aware of?**
   - The number of seats, `N`, is positive and at most 10^9.
   - `seat()` and `leave()` methods will be called at most 10^4 times.

2. **Is real-time performance a concern for this problem?**
   - Yes, methods need to be efficient given the constraints.

3. **Can we assume that seat and leave operations are interleaved correctly?**
   - Yes, a student will not leave if there are no students, and the student in seat `p` will always be present if `leave(p)` is called.

## Strategy

1. **Data Structures**:
   - We'll maintain a sorted list to keep track of occupied seats (`seats`). Sorting allows easier calculation of maximum distance.

2. **Algorithm for `seat()`**:
   - If the room is empty, the first student sits at seat 0.
   - For subsequent students, find the maximum distance between adjacent students and consider distances from the first seat to the first student and the last student to the last seat.
   - Insert the student in the determined seat and keep the list sorted.

3. **Algorithm for `leave(p)`**:
   - Simply remove `p` from the sorted list of occupied seats.

## Code

```python
class ExamRoom:

    def __init__(self, N: int):
        self.N = N
        self.seats = []

    def seat(self) -> int:
        if not self.seats:
            seat = 0
        else:
            # Consider the distance to the start and end
            max_distance = self.seats[0]
            prev_seat = -1
            seat = 0
            
            # Check the distances between the occupied seats
            for i in range(1, len(self.seats)):
                d = (self.seats[i] - self.seats[i - 1]) // 2
                if d > max_distance:
                    max_distance = d
                    seat = self.seats[i - 1] + d
            
            # Consider the distance to the last seat
            if self.N - 1 - self.seats[-1] > max_distance:
                seat = self.N - 1
            
        # Insert the new seat in the list and keep it sorted
        bisect.insort(self.seats, seat)
        return seat

    def leave(self, p: int) -> None:
        self.seats.remove(p)
```

## Time Complexity

1. **seat() Method**:
   - Finding the max distance costs O(K) where K is the number of occupied seats.
   - Inserting into the sorted list costs O(K).

2. **leave() Method**:
   - Removing from the sorted list costs O(K).

Given that `seat()` and `leave()` may be called 10^4 times, where K will be proportional to 10^4 at maximum, these operations are efficient.
