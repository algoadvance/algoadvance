title:  Execution of All Suffix Instructions Staying in a Grid-out
permalink: /s2120
---

You are given an `n x n` grid, and you start at the position `(startRow, startCol)` which represents your initial position in the grid.

You are given a string `s` that consists of movements:

- `'L'` means move left,
- `'R'` means move right,
- `'U'` means move up, and
- `'D'` means move down.

Return an array of integers `ans` each of length `|s|` where `ans[i]` is the number of instructions you can execute starting from the `i-th` instruction in the string `s` without leaving the grid.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the instructions string `s` be empty?
   - Yes, in that case, the result would be an empty list.

2. What should be returned if all instructions lead to positions within the grid?
   - The answer at each position should be the length of the remaining string starting from that position.

3. Are we limited to any specific range of `n` values?
   - Generally, `1 <= n <= 100`.

4. What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
   - Typically, `1 <= |s| <= 500`.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Create an empty list `ans` to store results.
2. **Iterate Over Instructions**: For each starting index `i` in the string `s`, do the following:
   - Initialize position `(r, c)` to `(startRow, startCol)`.
   - Initialize a counter `count` to 0 to count the number of valid instructions executed.
   - From the current starting index `i` to the end of the string `s`, for each instruction:
     - Update the position `(r, c)` according to the instruction.
     - Check if the new position is within the grid boundaries; if it is, increment the counter.
     - If it is not, break out of the loop as further instructions would also be invalid.
3. **Store Result**: Store the counter value in the list `ans`.
4. **Return Result**: After processing all starting indices, return the list `ans`.

### Code

```python
def execute_instructions(n, startPos, s):
    directions = {
        'L': (0, -1),
        'R': (0, 1),
        'U': (-1, 0),
        'D': (1, 0)
    }
    
    result = []
    
    for i in range(len(s)):
        r, c = startPos
        count = 0
        for j in range(i, len(s)):
            dr, dc = directions[s[j]]
            r += dr
            c += dc
            if 0 <= r < n and 0 <= c < n:
                count += 1
            else:
                break
        result.append(count)
    
    return result
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: Creating the directions dictionary is `O(1)`.
- **Outer Loop**: There are `len(s)` iterations.
- **Inner Loop**: For each starting point `i`, the inner loop might iterate up to `len(s) - i` times, on average `O(len(s)/2)` in the worst case.
  
Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(len(s)^2)`. Given the constraints, this quadratic time complexity is feasible.

### Example Test Case

```python
n = 3
startPos = [0, 1]
s = "RRDDLU"

print(execute_instructions(n, startPos, s))
# Expected Output: [1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 0]
```
