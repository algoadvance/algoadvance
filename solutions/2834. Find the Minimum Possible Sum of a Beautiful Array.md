title:  Find the Minimum Possible Sum of a Beautiful Array-out
permalink: /s2834
---

You are given a positive integer `n`. Construct a **beautiful array** with length `n` and return the minimum possible **sum** of this array. A beautiful array is an array where for every pair of integers `(i, j)` such that `0 <= i, j < n` and `i != j`, the following condition holds:

\[ \text{gcd}(\text{nums}[i], \text{nums}[j]) = 1 \]

where `gcd` denotes the greatest common divisor.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of `n`?
     - The range is \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\).

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Should we return just the sum, or do we need to construct and return the array?
     - We need to return the sum only.

## Strategy

1. **Understanding the Problem:** 
   - We need an array of length `n` such that every pair of elements in the array are co-prime i.e., their gcd is 1.
   - The main challenge lies in constructing such an array efficiently and ensuring the minimum possible sum.

2. **Algorithm Insight:**
   - One straightforward method is to use the first `n` prime numbers since any two different prime numbers have a gcd of 1.
   - However, prime number generation and summation need to be efficient.

3. **Steps to Solution:**
   - We will use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to generate prime numbers up to a reasonable limit.
   - We'll then take the first `n` prime numbers and compute their sum.

4. **Implementation Details:**
   - Use a sieve to generate prime numbers up to a range such that we cover at least `n` prime numbers.
   - Sum the first `n` primes to get the result.

## Code

Here's the Python implementation for the solution:

```python
def min_sum_beautiful_array(n):
    def sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit):
        is_prime = [True] * (limit + 1)
        p = 2
        while (p * p <= limit):
            if (is_prime[p] == True):
                for i in range(p * p, limit + 1, p):
                    is_prime[i] = False
            p += 1
        primes = []
        for p in range(2, limit + 1):
            if is_prime[p]:
                primes.append(p)
        return primes

    # Estimation of upper limit for n primes generation
    if n >= 10000:
        limit = n * 12  # Heuristic derived upper bound for range of sieve
    else:
        limit = n * 15

    # Generate primes
    primes = sieve_of_eratosthenes(limit)

    # Sum the first n primes
    result = sum(primes[:n])
    
    return result

# Example usage:
print(min_sum_beautiful_array(4))  # Output for testing
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sieve of Eratosthenes:** \(O(1)\) (amortized over large ranges due to the linear time prime number generation).
- **Summation:** \(O(n)\).
- **Total Complexity:** Dominated by the sieve and summation, leading to approximately \(O(n)\).

Given the constraints, this approach efficiently computes the minimum possible sum of a beautiful array.
