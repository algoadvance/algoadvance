Leetcode Problem 810: Chalkboard XOR Game

You are given an array of integers `nums`, representing the integers written on a chalkboard.

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

In each turn, a player selects and erases one number from `nums`, updating it to the XOR of all the remaining numbers.

If a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.

Assuming both Alice and Bob play optimally, return `True` if Alice wins the game, otherwise return `False`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What is the optimal strategy for Alice and Bob?**
   - Optimal strategy means that each player makes the move that maximizes their chances of winning.

2. **Are Alice and Bob aware of all previous moves?**
   - Yes, they are both fully aware of all the moves played so far and play optimally.

3. **Is Alice always the first player?**
   - Yes, Alice always starts first.

4. **What is the range of the length of `nums` and the integer values within `nums`?**
   - The problem statement does not specify, but we can assume reasonable size constraints typically used in competitive programming.

### Strategy:

1. **Initial Observation**:
   - If the XOR of all elements in `nums` is 0 at the beginning, Alice wins immediately as any further moves would keep the XOR results within Alice's favor.

2. **Game Length**:
   - If the number of elements in `nums` is even, Alice can always make the last move (since she starts first).

3. **Mathematical Insight**:
   - We need to consider the parity of the game length:
     - If the length of `nums` is even, Alice has a winning strategy because she starts first and will always be the one making the last move.
     - If the length of `nums` is odd, the final move will be made by Bob, so Alice can lose.

### Code:
Let's implement the solution based on the described strategy.

```python
def xorGame(nums):
    xor_sum = 0

    # Compute XOR of all elements
    for num in nums:
        xor_sum ^= num

    # Check if the XOR of the entire array is zero or the length of array is even
    # If either is true, Alice wins
    return xor_sum == 0 or len(nums) % 2 == 0
```

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity for computing the XOR of all elements is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the array `nums`.
- The space complexity is \( O(1) \) since no extra space is used apart from a few variables.

### Complete Solution:
```python
def xorGame(nums):
    xor_sum = 0

    # Compute XOR of all elements
    for num in nums:
        xor_sum ^= num

    # Check if the XOR of the entire array is zero or the length of array is even
    # If either is true, Alice wins
    return xor_sum == 0 or len(nums) % 2 == 0
```

This function will return `True` if Alice has a winning strategy based on the initial arrangement of `nums` and `False` otherwise.
