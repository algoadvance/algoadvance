title:  Maximum Average Pass Ratio-out
permalink: /s1792
---

You are given an integer `n` and an array `classes` where `classes[i] = [passi, totali]` indicating there are `passi` students that have passed out of `totali` students in the `ith` class. You are also given an integer `extraStudents` indicating that `extraStudents` new students can be added to any class.

The **pass ratio** of a class is defined as the number of students who pass divided by the number of students in the class. The **average pass ratio** is the sum of the pass ratios of all the classes divided by the number of classes.

Return the **maximum** possible average pass ratio after assigning `extraStudents` to classes optimally.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Clarification on constraints**: Are there any limitations on the size of `n`, the number of `classes`, or the value of `extraStudents`? 

2. **Decimal Values**: Should the final average pass ratio be rounded or truncated to any specific precision?

## Strategy

1. **Priority Queue (Max-Heap)**: To maximize the average pass ratio, we need to determine which class benefits the most from having an extra student added. This can be efficient with a max heap where we prioritize classes that will yield the highest marginal increase in pass ratio.

2. **Calculate Marginal Gain**: We need to calculate the gain in pass ratio when a student is added to a class. For each class, this is given by:
   \[
   \text{gain} = \left(\frac{passi + 1}{totali + 1}\right) - \left(\frac{passi}{totali}\right)
   \]

3. **Add Extra Students**: We repeatedly assign an extra student to the class with the highest gain, updating the heap each time.

## Code

```python
import heapq

class Solution:
    def maxAverageRatio(self, classes: List[List[int]], extraStudents: int) -> float:
        
        # Function to calculate the gain in pass ratio when a student is added
        def calculateGain(passi, totali):
            return (passi + 1) / (totali + 1) - passi / totali
        
        # Create a max-heap based on the gain (negate the gain for max-heap in Python)
        max_heap = []
        for passi, totali in classes:
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-calculateGain(passi, totali), passi, totali))
        
        # Assign all extra students to the classes with the highest gain
        for _ in range(extraStudents):
            gain, passi, totali = heapq.heappop(max_heap)
            passi += 1
            totali += 1
            heapq.heappush(max_heap, (-calculateGain(passi, totali), passi, totali))
        
        # Compute the final average pass ratio
        total_pass_ratio = 0
        for gain, passi, totali in max_heap:
            total_pass_ratio += passi / totali
        
        return total_pass_ratio / len(classes)
```

## Time Complexity

- **Building the Initial Heap**: \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of classes.
- **Iterating Extra Students**: For each of the `extraStudents`, we pop and push into the heap making it \(O(\text{extraStudents} \log n)\).
- **Final Calculation**: \(O(n)\), iterating through the heap to calculate the total pass ratio.

The total time complexity is \(O((n + \text{extraStudents}) \log n + n)\). This is efficient given typical constraints.

This solution effectively uses a max-heap to optimally distribute extra students to maximize the overall pass ratio.
