title:  Smallest Missing Genetic Value in Each Subtree-out
permalink: /s2003
---
Given an array `parents` representing a tree rooted at node 0. The parent of node `i` is `parent[i]`. The tree is guaranteed to have exactly one root, and the `parent` array has a length of `n`, where `n` is the total number of nodes in the tree.

Each node has a genetic value, given in an array `nums`. Therefore, `nums[i]` represents the genetic value of node `i`.

You are tasked with finding the smallest missing genetic value in each subtree of the tree. Formally, for each node `i`, you need to determine the smallest positive integer mSSGV (Minimum Smallest Subtree Genetic Value) that is missing from the genetic values in the subtree rooted at node `i`.

Return an array `result` where `result[i]` is the mSSGV for the subtree rooted at node `i`.

### Example
- Input:
  - `parents = [-1,0,0,2]`
  - `nums = [1,2,3,4]`
- Output:
  - `[5, 1, 1, 1]`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Is there any restriction on the values within `nums` other than they are positive integers?
2. For any node `i`, what happens if the subtree only contains high values (e.g., all values start from 2)?
3. Can we assume that the input arrays will always be valid and represent a tree structure as described?

## Strategy
1. **Tree Representation**: Read the `parents` array to reconstruct the tree using adjacency lists.
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Use DFS to traverse the tree for subtree extraction.
3. **Tracking Present Values**: Use a set to track all values found in the current subtree.
4. **Finding the Missing Value**: For each node, after collecting its subtree values, find the smallest missing positive integer by iterating through increasing integers starting from 1.

## Code
```python
from collections import defaultdict

def smallestMissingValueSubtree(parents, nums):
    n = len(parents)
    tree = defaultdict(list)
    for i in range(n):
        if parents[i] != -1:
            tree[parents[i]].append(i)
    
    def dfs(node):
        subtree_vals = set()
        stack = [node]
        while stack:
            curr = stack.pop()
            subtree_vals.add(nums[curr])
            for child in tree[curr]:
                stack.append(child)
        return subtree_vals
    
    result = []
    for i in range(n):
        subtree_vals = dfs(i)
        missing_value = 1
        while missing_value in subtree_vals:
            missing_value += 1
        result.append(missing_value)
    
    return result

# Example Usage
parents = [-1, 0, 0, 2]
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
print(smallestMissingValueSubtree(parents, nums))  # Output: [5, 1, 1, 1]
```

## Time Complexity
- **Tree Construction**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes (length of the `parents` array).
- **DFS Traversal**: O(n^2), since we perform DFS for each node, leading to a potential O(n) operation for each node.
- **Overall**: The algorithm has a time complexity of O(n^2), which might be suboptimal for large trees. Further optimizations could involve more efficient handling of subtree values.

This approach traverses each subtree in its entirety for each node, collecting the genetic values and checking them for the smallest missing integer. While this is straightforward, it is not the most efficient and improvements can be made, particularly for larger data sets.
