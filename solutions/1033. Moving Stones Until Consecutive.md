title:  Moving Stones Until Consecutive-out
permalink: /s1033
---
You are given three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` in ascending order, representing the positions of three stones on a number line. We want to make these stones consecutive, i.e., the difference between the positions of any two adjacent stones is exactly `1`.

To achieve this, you can move a stone from one position to another. The moves are allowed in two ways:
1. You can pick up any stone and move it to any other available position.
2. You need to calculate:
   - the minimum number of moves required to make the stones consecutive, and
   - the maximum number of moves required to make the stones consecutive.

Return an array `answer` of length 2 where:
- `answer[0]` is the minimum number of moves,
- `answer[1]` is the maximum number of moves.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
    - Are `a`, `b`, and `c` guaranteed to be distinct integers?
    - Are there constraints on the range of these integers?

2. **Position Order**:
    - Is the order of `a`, `b`, and `c` guaranteed to be in ascending order?
    - How should we handle cases where `a`, `b`, and `c` might be equal or very close to each other?

### Assumptions
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are distinct integers.
- `a`, `b`, and `c` are given in ascending order such that `a < b < c`.
- The range for `a`, `b`, and `c` is reasonably large but within typical integer bounds.

### Strategy
1. **Identifying Gaps**:
    - Calculate the gaps between the stones: `gap1 = b - a - 1` and `gap2 = c - b - 1`.

2. **Minimum Moves**:
    - If either `gap1` or `gap2` is 0 (i.e., two stones are already adjacent), only one move is needed.
    - If either of the gaps is 1 (e.g., the sequence is like `1, 2, 4`), only one move is needed to make them consecutive.
    - Otherwise, it requires 2 moves.

3. **Maximum Moves**:
    - The maximum number of moves would be to bring both non-adjacent stones close to the middle stone. This is simply the sum of the two gaps: `gap1 + gap2`.

### Code
```python
def numMovesStones(a, b, c):
    # Sorted ensures a <= b <= c if not already in order
    stones = sorted([a, b, c])
    a, b, c = stones[0], stones[1], stones[2]

    # Calculate the gaps
    gap1 = b - a - 1
    gap2 = c - b - 1

    # Calculate minimum moves
    if gap1 == 0 and gap2 == 0:
        min_moves = 0
    elif gap1 <= 1 or gap2 <= 1:
        min_moves = 1
    else:
        min_moves = 2

    # Calculate maximum moves
    max_moves = gap1 + gap2

    return [min_moves, max_moves]

# Example usage
print(numMovesStones(1, 2, 5))  # Output: [1, 2]
print(numMovesStones(4, 3, 2))  # Output: [0, 0]
print(numMovesStones(3, 5, 1))  # Output: [1, 2]
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(1)` because it involves a constant amount of arithmetic operations and comparisons which do not depend on the size of the input. 

The space complexity is also `O(1)` because we are using a constant amount of extra space.

### Summary
- The problem has been broken down into checking gaps between the stones.
- The minimum moves depend on whether there are stones adjacent or one move away.
- The maximum moves are simply the sum of the gaps between the stones.
- The approach ensures the solution is optimal in constant time.
