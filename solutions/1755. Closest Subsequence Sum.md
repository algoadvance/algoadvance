Leetcode 1755: Closest Subsequence Sum

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `goal`, return the absolute difference between the sum of the subsequence of `nums` and `goal` that is the smallest possible.

A subsequence is an array derived from the original array by deleting some or none elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for the elements in `nums` and the `goal`?**
   - This will help in assessing potential optimizations.
2. **What is the length of the `nums` array?**
   - This will help in determining the feasibility of different algorithmic approaches.
3. **Can the `nums` array contain negative numbers?**
   - This affects the possible range of subsequence sums.
4. **Can we assume the input to be valid (i.e., non-empty array, valid integers)?**
   - Normally a valid input is given, but it's always good to confirm.

Assuming:
- The length of `nums` is manageable within usual competition ranges, say up to 40.
- `nums` can contain both positive and negative values.
- Goal is any integer.

### Strategy

1. **Divide and Conquer + Meet in the Middle Approach:**
   - Split the array `nums` into two halves.
   - Generate all possible subsequence sums for both halves.
   - For each sum in one half, look for the closest sum in the other half that together approximate the `goal`.

2. **Steps to Implement:**
   - Split `nums` into two parts.
   - Generate all possible sums of subsequences for both parts.
   - Sort the sums of one part.
   - For each sum in the other part, use binary search to find the closest sum in the sorted sums of the first part.
   - Track the minimum absolute difference to `goal`.

### Code

```python
from bisect import bisect_left
from itertools import chain, combinations

def closestSubsequenceSum(nums, goal):
    # Function to generate all subset sums of an array
    def subset_sums(arr):
        return list(map(sum, chain.from_iterable(combinations(arr, r) for r in range(len(arr) + 1))))
    
    n = len(nums)
    if n == 0: return abs(goal)
    
    left, right = nums[:n//2], nums[n//2:]
    
    left_sums = subset_sums(left)
    right_sums = subset_sums(right)
    
    right_sums.sort()
    
    # Initialize the minimum difference
    min_diff = float('inf')
    
    for sumL in left_sums:
        # Binary search for closest value to (goal - sumL) in right_sums
        remaining = goal - sumL
        pos = bisect_left(right_sums, remaining)
        
        if pos < len(right_sums):
            min_diff = min(min_diff, abs(remaining - right_sums[pos]))
            
        if pos > 0:
            min_diff = min(min_diff, abs(remaining - right_sums[pos - 1]))
    
    return min_diff

# Example
nums = [5, -7, 3, 5]
goal = 6
print(closestSubsequenceSum(nums, goal))  # Output: 0
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Subset Sum Generation:**
   - For each of the two halves, we generate all possible subset sums. This will take `O(2^(n/2))` time.
   
2. **Sorting:**
   - Sorting one of the lists of subset sums will take `O(2^(n/2) * log(2^(n/2))) = O(2^(n/2) * (n/2)) = O(n * 2^(n/2))`.

3. **Binary Search:**
   - For each sum in the subset sums of the first half, we perform a binary search in the second half. This will take `O(2^(n/2) * log(2^(n/2))) = O(n * 2^(n/2))`.

Overall time complexity would be dominated by `O(n * 2^(n/2))`, which is feasible for `n` up to 40.
