You are given a string `s`. There is a strange printer with the following two special properties:

1. The printer can only print a sequence of the same character each time.
2. At each turn, the printer can print a new sequence of characters or continue printing the same sequence it started in the previous turn.

Given the string `s`, your task is to compute the minimum number of turns the printer needs to print the entire string.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "aaabbb"
Output: 2
Explanation: Print "aaa" first, then "bbb".
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "aba"
Output: 2
Explanation: Print "aaa" first, then change to "b" and print again "a".
```

Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the printer stop printing in the middle of a turn, or must it finish printing the entire sequence it started in that turn?
   - The printer must print the entire sequence of the same character once it starts.

2. Are there any constraints on the types of characters in the string?
   - The string consists of only lowercase English letters.

## Strategy

The problem can be approached using Dynamic Programming (DP). Let's define a DP table `dp[i][j]` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of turns needed to print the substring `s[i:j+1]`.

### Steps:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize `dp[i][i] = 1` for all `i`, because printing a single character always takes one turn.
   - Initialize `dp[i][j] = 0` for all `i > j` (invalid ranges).

2. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - For substrings of increasing length, compute `dp[i][j]`.
   - If characters `s[i]` and `s[j]` are the same, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1]`.
   - Otherwise, try to split the substring into two parts at different positions `k` (`i <= k < j`), and compute the minimum turns needed as:
     ```python
     dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][k] + dp[k+1][j])
     ```

3. **Result**:
   - The result for the entire string `s` will be found in `dp[0][n-1]`, where `n` is the length of the string.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this approach is `O(n^3)`, where `n` is the length of the string. This is due to the nested loops for filling the DP table.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(n^2)` due to the DP table usage.

## Code

```python
def strangePrinter(s: str) -> int:
    n = len(s)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize DP table
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Base case for single character substrings
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i][i] = 1
    
    # Fill the DP table
    for length in range(2, n + 1): # length of the substring
        for i in range(n - length + 1):
            j = i + length - 1
            dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + 1 # Maximum turns if we assume all different characters
            for k in range(i, j):
                if s[k] == s[j]:
                    dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + (dp[k+1][j-1] if j-1 >= k+1 else 0))
    
    return dp[0][n-1]

# Example usage
s = "aba"
print(strangePrinter(s))  # Output: 2
```

In the example usage above, the function returns `2`, meaning the printer needs 2 turns to print the string "aba".
