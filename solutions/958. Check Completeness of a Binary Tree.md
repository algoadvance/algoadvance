title:  Check Completeness of a Binary Tree-out
permalink: /s958

Given the `root` of a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.

In a complete binary tree, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be returned?**  
   Return `True` if the tree is complete, otherwise return `False`.

2. **What are the constraints?**  
   The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 100]`. 
   The tree nodes have values in the range `[1, 1000]`.

### Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**  
   We can use a BFS (level order traversal) to check the completeness of the binary tree.
   
2. **Queue Mechanism:**
   - Use a queue to facilitate level order traversal.
   - If we encounter `None` in the queue, it signifies that all nodes following the `None` must also be `None` for the tree to be complete.
   
3. **Check Validity:**
   - While we traverse the tree, we need to check if after encountering the first `None`, all subsequent nodes are also `None`. If at any point this condition fails, the tree is not complete.

### Code

```python
from collections import deque

def isCompleteTree(root):
    if not root:
        return True
    
    queue = deque([root])
    end_flag = False
    
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        
        if node is None:
            end_flag = True
        else:
            if end_flag:
                return False
            queue.append(node.left)
            queue.append(node.right)
    
    return True
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization:**  
   - A queue is initialized with the root node.
   - The `end_flag` is used to signify that a `None` has been encountered.

2. **BFS Traversal:**
   - We dequeue a node. If it's `None`, we set the `end_flag` to `True`.
   - If we encounter a non-`None` node after setting `end_flag` to `True`, it means the tree is not complete.

3. **Appending Children:**
   - For each node, append its left and right children to the queue.
   - Continue this process until the queue is emptied.

4. **Return Result:**  
   - If we successfully traverse the tree without violating the completeness conditions, return `True`.
   - Otherwise, return `False`.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`. In the worst case (a full binary tree), we will have at most `n`/2 nodes in the queue at the same time.

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine if the binary tree is complete using BFS traversal.
