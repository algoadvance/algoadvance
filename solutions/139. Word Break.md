Given a string `s` and a dictionary of strings `wordDict`, determine if `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

**Example:**
```
Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet", "code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
```

**Example:**
```
Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple", "pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
Note that you are allowed to reuse dictionary words.
```

**Example:**
```
Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]
Output: false
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the dictionary contain repeated words?**
   - The dictionary typically does not contain repeated words, as they won't affect the solution.

2. **Is the dictionary case-sensitive?**
   - Yes, assume that the dictionary is case-sensitive.

3. **Are there any limits on the length of the string or the dictionary?**
   - Typically, constraints will be such that a reasonable algorithm can solve it in time.

4. **Can the string `s` be empty? What should be the output for an empty string with any dictionary?**
   - Yes, the string `s` can be empty. If `s` is empty, the output should be `true` since it trivially satisfies the condition.

### Strategy

We can use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Letâ€™s define a boolean array `dp` where `dp[i]` will be `True` if the substring `s[:i]` can be segmented into words from the dictionary and `False` otherwise.

The steps are:
1. **Initialization:** Set `dp[0] = True`, meaning that an empty string can always be segmented.
2. **Filling the dp array:** For every position `i` in the string from 1 to `len(s)`, check every possible substring `s[j:i]` where `0 <= j < i`. If `dp[j]` is `True` and the substring `s[j:i]` is in `wordDict`, then set `dp[i]` to `True`.

Finally, return `dp[-1]`, which tells if the entire string can be segmented.

### Code

```python
def wordBreak(s: str, wordDict: list) -> bool:
    word_set = set(wordDict)  # Convert list to set for O(1) lookups
    dp = [False] * (len(s) + 1)
    dp[0] = True  # Base case: empty string

    for i in range(1, len(s) + 1):
        for j in range(i):
            if dp[j] and s[j:i] in word_set:
                dp[i] = True
                break

    return dp[-1]

# Example test cases
print(wordBreak("leetcode", ["leet", "code"]))  # Output: True
print(wordBreak("applepenapple", ["apple", "pen"]))  # Output: True
print(wordBreak("catsandog", ["cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat"]))  # Output: False
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is `O(n^2 * m)`:
- `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `m` is the maximum length of a single word in `wordDict`.

- There are `n` iterations for the outer loop.
- For each `i`, the inner loop runs `i` times, resulting in `O(n^2)` iterations.
- Checking if a substring is in the set `wordDict` takes `O(m)` in the worst case. 

So overall, the complexity is `O(n^2 * m)`. The space complexity is `O(n)` due to the `dp` array.
