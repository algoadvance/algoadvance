title:  Find the Largest Palindrome Divisible by K-out
permalink: /s3260
---

You are given an integer \( k \). Your task is to find the largest palindrome number less than or equal to \( 10^9 \) that is divisible by \( k \). If no such number exists, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of \( k \)?**
   - \( k \) is a positive integer where \( 1 \leq k \leq 10^6 \).
2. **What is the largest number we should consider for palindrome checking?**
   - The largest number we consider is \( 10^9 \).

### Strategy

1. **Understanding Palindromes**:
   - A palindrome is a number that reads the same forward and backward, such as 121 or 12321.

2. **Generating Palindromes**:
   - To efficiently find the largest palindrome, we can create palindromes starting from \( 10^9 \) and go downwards.

3. **Check for Divisibility**:
   - For every palindrome, check if it is divisible by \( k \).
   - If it is, return the palindrome.
   - If none are found by the time we check down to a smaller threshold, return -1.

### Code

```python
def is_palindrome(x):
    return str(x) == str(x)[::-1]

def largest_palindrome_divisible_by_k(k):
    for num in range(10**9, 0, -1):
        if is_palindrome(num) and num % k == 0:
            return num
    return -1
```

### Time Complexity

- **Palindrome Check**: The time complexity for checking if a number is a palindrome is \( O(d) \), where \( d \) is the number of digits.
- **Main Loop**:
  - The maximum number of iterations would be \( 10^9 \), but in practice, we will exit early upon finding the largest palindrome divisible by \( k \).
  - In the worst case, navigating all the way from \( 10^9 \) to 1 will involve checking approximately \( 10^9 \) numbers.

### Optimized Strategy for Efficiency

1. **Generating palindromes directly to avoid looping from \( 10^9 \)**:
   - Generate palindromes in descending order starting from upper limits such as \( 999999999 \) or \( 987654321 \), etc.
   - Efficiently check each generated palindrome for divisibility by \( k \).

Here is the optimized version of the code:

```python
def largest_palindrome_divisible_by_k(k):
    def generate_palindromes(n):
        str_n = str(n)
        half = (len(str_n) + 1) // 2
        for i in range(n // 10, 0, -1):
            for j in (str(i) + str(i)[-1:(-half - 1):-1], str(i) + str(i)[-2:(-half - 1):-1]):
                yield int(j)
    
    for p in generate_palindromes(10**9):
        if p % k == 0:
            return p
    return -1

# Example usage
k = 123456
print(largest_palindrome_divisible_by_k(k))
```

### Summary

- The initial approach of checking from \( 10^9 \) downwards is direct but inefficient.
- The optimized approach involves generating and checking palindromes directly, which significantly reduces the number of checks.
- This ensures finding the largest palindrome efficiently.
