title:  Decode the Message-out

Leetcode Problem 2325, "Decode the Message," requires you to decode a message using a substitution cipher. A substitution cipher replaces each letter in the alphabet with another letter, mapping each letter to a different one.

Given two strings, `key` and `message`, where `key` defines the substitution rule and `message` is the encoded message, you must decode the message.

- `key` is a string containing lowercase English letters and spaces, and each letter appears only once.
- The encoded message `message` only contains lowercase English letters and spaces.

You need to decode the message and return it.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are there any constraints on the length of `key` or `message`?
2. Are spaces in the message and key to be ignored or mapped directly?

For the sake of clarity, letâ€™s assume:
- `key` is of length exactly 26 (one for each letter of the alphabet).
- `message` can be of any length but will contain only lowercase letters and spaces.

### Strategy
1. **Create a Mapping Dictionary**: Use the `key` to create a mapping from each letter to another letter in the alphabet.
2. **Decode the Message**: Iterate through the `message`, replacing each letter according to the created mapping.
3. **Handle Spaces**: Ensure spaces remain unchanged in the decoded message.

### Steps
1. Create a dictionary using the `key` to map each character to an actual letter ('a' to 'z').
2. Traverse through the `message` and substitute each letter using this dictionary. For spaces, keep them as is.
3. Construct the decoded message from the substitutions.

### Code

```python
def decodeMessage(key: str, message: str) -> str:
    # Remove duplicates from key while maintaining order
    seen = set()
    key = ''.join([x for x in key if not (x in seen or seen.add(x))])
    
    # Create the mapping dictionary
    substitution = dict()
    for i, char in enumerate(key):
        if char != ' ':
            substitution[char] = chr(ord('a') + i)
    
    # Decode the message
    decoded_message = []
    for char in message:
        if char == ' ':
            decoded_message.append(' ')
        else:
            decoded_message.append(substitution[char])
    
    return ''.join(decoded_message)

# Example usage:
key = "the quick brown fox jumps over a lazy dog"
message = "vkbs bs t suepuv"
print(decodeMessage(key, message))  # Output: "this is a secret"
```

### Time Complexity
- **O(N)** where N is the length of the `message`. Creating the substitution dictionary takes constant time (since we process a fixed 26 characters from `key`), and decoding involves a linear scan of the `message`.

By constructing the mapping once and reusing it to decode the message, this solution ensures efficiency.
