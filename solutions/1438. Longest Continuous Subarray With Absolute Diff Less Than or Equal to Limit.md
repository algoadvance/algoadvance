title:  Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff Less Than or Equal to Limit-out
permalink: /s1438
---
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `limit`, return the size of the longest continuous subarray such that the absolute difference between any two elements in this subarray is less than or equal to `limit`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Q**: Can `nums` contain negative numbers?
   **A**: Yes, `nums` can have negative numbers as well.
   
2. **Q**: What is the range of values for `nums` and `limit`?
   **A**: `nums` can have lengths up to `10^5` and the values of each element in `nums` can range from `-10^9` to `10^9`. The `limit` will also be a non-negative integer.

3. **Q**: Do we need to return the subarray itself?
   **A**: No, we only need to return the size of the longest continuous subarray.

### Strategy:
To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach along with two deques to keep track of the maximum and minimum values of the current window. Hereâ€™s the detailed strategy:

1. Use two deques:
   - One deque (`max_deque`) to keep track of the maximum values in the current window.
   - One deque (`min_deque`) to keep track of the minimum values in the current window.
   
2. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, both set to 0. `right` is the end of the window and `left` is the start.
   
3. Iterate through the array with `right` pointer:
   - For each `right`, add `nums[right]` to both deques while maintaining the decreasing order in `max_deque` and increasing order in `min_deque`.
   - Check the absolute difference between the maximum and minimum values of the current window (i.e., the elements at the front of both deques). If the difference is greater than `limit`, increment `left` to reduce the window size until the condition is satisfied.
   
4. Keep track of the maximum size of the window during the iteration.

### Time Complexity:
- Adding and removing from deques are O(1) operations.
- Each element is added and removed at most once to/from the deques.
- The overall time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`.

### Code:

```python
from collections import deque

def longestSubarray(nums, limit):
    max_deque = deque()
    min_deque = deque()
    left = 0
    max_length = 0

    for right in range(len(nums)):
        while max_deque and nums[right] > max_deque[-1]:
            max_deque.pop()
        while min_deque and nums[right] < min_deque[-1]:
            min_deque.pop()
        
        max_deque.append(nums[right])
        min_deque.append(nums[right])
        
        while max_deque[0] - min_deque[0] > limit:
            if max_deque[0] == nums[left]:
                max_deque.popleft()
            if min_deque[0] == nums[left]:
                min_deque.popleft()
            left += 1
        
        max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)

    return max_length
```

This code efficiently finds the length of the longest subarray where the absolute difference between the largest and smallest values in the subarray does not exceed the given limit.
