You are given an integer array `destination = [x, y]` representing your location on an `x-y` grid. You are also given an integer `k`. You are standing at the origin `(0, 0)` and you want to reach the destination. The only movements allowed are:

- `'H'` for moving one step to the right (horizontally)
- `'V'` for moving one step upwards (vertically)

You need to find the k-th lexicographically smallest sequence of moves that will take you to your destination.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the values of `x` and `y` be zero?
   - Response: No, both `x` and `y` are guaranteed to be positive integers since we are moving `x` steps horizontally and `y` steps vertically to reach the destination.
2. Are there any constraints on the value of `k`?
   - Response: Yes, `1 <= k <= (x + y)C(y)`, where (x + y)C(y) is the binomial coefficient representing the total number of valid sequences.
3. Are the moves guaranteed to always take us to the destination `(x, y)`?
   - Response: Yes, the destination is always reached using exactly `x` horizontal moves and `y` vertical moves.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we can use combinatorial mathematics and a greedy approach:

1. **Combinatorial Counting:**
   - We need to count how many sequences start with `'H'` and how many start with `'V'`.

2. **Recursive Construction:**
   - We start with an empty sequence and at each step decide whether the next move should be an `'H'` or `'V'`.
   - Use the binomial coefficient to determine how many sequences start with `'H'` if the remaining sequence still meets the destination.

3. **Selection:**
   - If the number of sequences starting with `'H'` is greater than or equal to `k`, prepend `'H'` and reduce the necessary horizontal moves by one.
   - Otherwise, subtract the number of sequences starting with `'H'` from `k`, prepend `'V'`, and reduce the necessary vertical moves by one.

### Code

```python
from math import comb

def kthSmallestPath(destination, k):
    x, y = destination
    result = []
    
    while x > 0 and y > 0:
        # Number of sequences starting with 'H'
        H_sequences = comb(x + y - 1, y)
        
        if k <= H_sequences:
            result.append('H')
            x -= 1
        else:
            result.append('V')
            k -= H_sequences
            y -= 1
    
    # Append the remaining 'H's or 'V's
    result.extend(['H'] * x)
    result.extend(['V'] * y)
    
    return ''.join(result)

# Example usage
destination = [2, 3]
k = 3
print(kthSmallestPath(destination, k))  # Output: "HVVHV"
```

### Time Complexity

- **Computational Complexity:**
  - Calculating the binomial coefficient can be done in `O(min(x, y))` time using a dynamic programming approach or efficiently in constant time if Python's `math.comb` is used.

- **Overall Complexity:**
  - Given that each step involves checking the binomial coefficient and making a decision, the overall complexity is `O(x + y)`, which is efficient for reasonable input sizes.

This code will correctly generate the k-th lexicographically smallest sequence reaching from `(0, 0)` to `(x, y)` using the allowed movements `'H'` and `'V'`.
