title:  Find Polygon With the Largest Perimeter-out
permalink: /s2971
---

You are given an array of integers `nums` representing the lengths of sides of polygons. Your task is to find the polygon (a polygon with at least 3 sides) with the largest perimeter that can be formed using sides from the given array. If no polygon can be formed, return 0.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the range of the length of the array `nums`?
   - **Answer**: The array `nums` can have up to 10^4 elements.

2. **Side Length Values**: What are the valid ranges for the side lengths in `nums`?
   - **Answer**: Each side length in `nums` can be any positive integer.

3. **Output**: Should the function return just the largest perimeter, or also the sides forming the polygon?
   - **Answer**: The function should return just the largest perimeter.

4. **Multiple Possible Polygons**: If there are multiple valid polygons with the same largest perimeter, is only one required as the result?
   - **Answer**: Yes, we just need to return the value of the largest perimeter.

### Strategy

1. **Sorting**: Sort the array `nums` in descending order. Sorting helps in quickly finding the largest perimeter as the largest sides appear first.

2. **Triangle Inequality Theorem**: To form a valid polygon (triangle in this case since the minimum polygon to consider is with 3 sides), any three sides a, b, and c must satisfy the triangle inequality theorem:
   - \( a + b > c \)
   - \( a + c > b \)
   - \( b + c > a \)

   After sorting, since \( a \geq b \geq c \):
   - We only need to check if \( a < b + c \).

3. **Iterate and Check**: Iterate through the sorted array and for each triplet of sides, check if they form a valid triangle. The first valid triplet will give the largest possible perimeter.

### Code

```python
def largestPerimeter(nums):
    # Sort the sides in descending order
    nums.sort(reverse=True)
    
    # Iterate through the sorted list to find the first valid triplet
    for i in range(len(nums) - 2):
        if nums[i] < nums[i + 1] + nums[i + 2]:
            # The first valid triplet found
            return nums[i] + nums[i + 1] + nums[i + 2]
    
    # If no valid polygon is found, return 0
    return 0
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: Sorting the array takes \( O(n \log n) \).
- **Iteration**: Iterating through the sorted array has a linear time complexity, \( O(n) \).

Hence, the overall time complexity of this solution is \( O(n \log n) \).
