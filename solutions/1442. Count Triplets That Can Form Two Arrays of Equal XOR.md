title:  Count Triplets That Can Form Two Arrays of Equal XOR-out
permalink: /s1442
---

### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `arr`, you need to find the number of triplets `(i, j, k)` such that:

1. `0 <= i < j <= k < len(arr)`
2. The XOR of the subarray `arr[i] ^ arr[i+1] ^ ... ^ arr[j-1]` is equal to the XOR of the subarray `arr[j] ^ arr[j+1] ^ ... ^ arr[k]`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the array be empty or contain only one element?
   - According to the constraints, the length of the array is between 1 and 300, so we won't handle the empty case as invalid input.
   
2. Should the elements be non-negative?
   - The problem does not restrict the values, so elements can be positive or negative integers.

### Strategy
To solve the problem, we can use the properties of XOR:
- `a ^ a = 0`
- `a ^ 0 = a`
- XOR is both associative and commutative.

Given the requirement:
- `arr[i] ^ arr[i+1] ^ ... ^ arr[j-1] == arr[j] ^ arr[j+1] ^ ... ^ arr[k]`

We can denote the XOR from the start to any index `n` as `xor(0, n)`, shorthand as `prefix_xor[n]`.

For the triplet `(i, j, k)`, we want:
- `prefix_xor(i-1) ^ prefix_xor(j-1) = prefix_xor(j-1) ^ prefix_xor(k)`

Which simplifies to:
- `prefix_xor(i-1) = prefix_xor(k)`

Thus, we just need to find all indices `i` that can combine to form the same `prefix_xor` value.

### Code
Here is the Python implementation of the solution:

```python
def countTriplets(arr):
    count = 0
    n = len(arr)
    prefix_xor = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    # Compute prefix_xor array
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        prefix_xor[i] = prefix_xor[i - 1] ^ arr[i - 1]
    
    # Find all triplets
    for j in range(n):
        for k in range(j + 1, n):
            if prefix_xor[j] == prefix_xor[k + 1]:
                count += k - j
    
    return count

# Example usage:
arr = [2, 3, 1, 6, 7]
print(countTriplets(arr))  # Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity
- Calculating the `prefix_xor` array requires O(n) time.
- Finding all triplets requires O(n^2) time due to the nested loop structure.

Thus, the overall time complexity of this approach is O(n^2).

This should be efficient enough for the constraints given (n up to 300).
