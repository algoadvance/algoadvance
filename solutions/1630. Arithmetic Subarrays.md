title:  Arithmetic Subarrays-out
permalink: /s1630
---

You are given an array of `nums` and an array of `queries`, where `queries[i] = [l_i, r_i]`. For each query `i`, compute whether the subarray from `l_i` to `r_i` (inclusive) can be rearranged to form an arithmetic sequence. Return a list of boolean values corresponding to the answer of each query.

An array is said to be an arithmetic sequence if the differences between consecutive elements are the same.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**: What is the size range of `nums` and `queries`? This will help in optimizing the solution.
    - `nums`: Up to 500 elements.
    - `queries`: Up to 500 queries.

2. **Element Values**: What are the possible values for the elements in the `nums` array?
    - `-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`.

3. **Subarray Details**: Should the subarray be a deep copy or just a reference?
    - A deep copy (so the original array remains unchanged).

4. **Function Signature**: How would you like the function to be defined?
    - Suggested function signature: `def checkArithmeticSubarrays(nums: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[bool]`.

### Code

```python
from typing import List

def checkArithmeticSubarrays(nums: List[int], queries: List[List[int]]) -> List[bool]:
    def is_arithmetic(arr: List[int]) -> bool:
        if len(arr) <= 2:
            return True
        arr.sort()
        diff = arr[1] - arr[0]
        for i in range(2, len(arr)):
            if arr[i] - arr[i - 1] != diff:
                return False
        return True

    result = []
    for l, r in queries:
        subarray = nums[l:r + 1]
        result.append(is_arithmetic(subarray))
    
    return result
```

### Strategy

1. **Function Definition and Utility Function**:
   - Define a helper function `is_arithmetic` that determines if a given list can be arranged to be an arithmetic sequence.
   - This involves sorting the subarray and then checking if the differences between consecutive elements are the same.
2. **Processing Queries**:
   - For each query `[l_i, r_i]`, extract the subarray from `nums[l_i]` to `nums[r_i]`.
   - Use the helper function to determine if the subarray is an arithmetic sequence.
   - Collect results for each query and return the list of boolean values.

### Time Complexity

1. **Subarray Extraction**: Extracting the subarray has a time complexity of `O(r - l)` for each query.
2. **Sorting**: Sorting the subarray has a time complexity of `O(k log k)` where `k` is the length of the subarray.
3. **Checking Arithmetic Sequence**: This is `O(k)` for each subarray.

For each query overall time complexity is `O((r-l) + k log k + k)`. In the worst case, this could get close to `O(n log n)` for each query, leading to an overall complexity of `O(q * n log n)` where `q` is the number of queries. Given the constraints, this approach should be efficient enough.

### Edge Cases
1. **Subarrays of size 2 or less**: Any subarray of size 2 or less is trivially an arithmetic sequence.
2. **Negative and large numbers**: Handled naturally by Python's sorting and arithmetic comparison operations.

This should provide a clear and efficient approach to solving the problem.
