title:  Minimum Cost of Buying Candies With Discount-out
permalink: /s2144
---

You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of the `i-th` candy.

Return the minimum cost of buying all the candies. In order to get the discount, you will follow these steps:

1. Pick the 2 most expensive candies.
2. Out of those 2 picked candies, pay the cost of the most expensive candy and get the other candy for free.
3. Repeat this process until all candies are consumed.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the candy costs in the array always positive integers?
   - Yes, you can assume each candy has a positive integer cost.
   
2. What if the number of candies is odd?
   - If there's an odd number of candies, the last remaining candy will be paid for at full price.

3. Are there any constraints on the size of the array?
   - Yes, the size of the array could be large, so the solution should be efficient.

### Strategy

To minimize the total cost:
1. **Sort the `cost` array in descending order.**
2. **Process the sorted array in chunks of three candies each.** In each chunk, you pay for the two most expensive candies, and the third candy (which is the cheapest in the chunk) is free.
3. **Sum up the costs of the paid candies.**

### Code

Here's a Python code solution that follows the above strategy:

```python
def minimumCost(cost):
    # Sort the list in descending order
    cost.sort(reverse=True)
    
    total_cost = 0
    n = len(cost)
    
    # Process the candies in chunks of three
    for i in range(n):
        # Add the cost of the candy if it's not the third one in a group of three
        if i % 3 != 2:
            total_cost += cost[i]
    
    return total_cost

# Example usage:
print(minimumCost([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 5
print(minimumCost([6, 5, 7, 9, 2, 2]))  # Output: 23
print(minimumCost([5, 5]))  # Output: 10
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the array**: \(O(n \log n)\) where `n` is the number of candies.
- **Iterating and calculating total cost**: \(O(n)\)

Hence, the overall time complexity is **\(O(n \log n)\)** due to the sorting step.

This approach ensures that we are minimizing the cost by taking the optimal discount repeatedly.
