title:  Kth Largest Sum in a Binary Tree-out
permalink: /s2583
---

Given a binary tree, you need to find the kth largest sum of the levels of the binary tree. The level sum is simply the sum of all node values at a given level. Return the kth largest sum among all levels of the binary tree. If there are fewer than k levels in the tree, return -1.

### Example:
Input: root = [5,8,3,1,2,7,4], k = 2

```
        5
      /   \
     8     3
    / \   / \
   1   2 7   4
```

Output: 13

Explanation:
- The sums of the levels are: 
    - Level 0: 5
    - Level 1: 11 (8 + 3)
    - Level 2: 14 (1 + 2 + 7 + 4)
    - The 2nd largest sum is 13 (Level 2 has the largest sum 14, Level 1 has the second largest sum 13).

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the binary tree be empty, and if yes, what should be returned?
   - If the tree is empty, there are no levels, so return -1.
   
2. Can multiple nodes on the same level have the same values?
   - Yes, nodes can have any integer value, including duplicates.
   
3. What if the given value of `k` is larger than the number of levels in the binary tree?
   - If `k` is larger than the number of levels, return -1.

## Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: We'll use BFS to traverse the tree level by level.
2. **Track Level Sums**: During the BFS traversal, we'll calculate the sum of node values for each level.
3. **Store Level Sums**: Store the sums in a list.
4. **Sort and Find kth Largest**: Sort the list of sums in descending order and return the kth largest sum if it exists; otherwise, return -1.

## Code

```python
from collections import deque

def kth_largest_sum(root, k):
    if not root:
        return -1
    
    # BFS to compute level sums
    level_sums = []
    queue = deque([(root, 0)])
    
    current_level = 0
    current_sum = 0
    
    while queue:
        node, level = queue.popleft()
        if level == current_level:
            current_sum += node.val
        else:
            level_sums.append(current_sum)
            current_sum = node.val
            current_level = level
        
        if node.left:
            queue.append((node.left, level + 1))
        if node.right:
            queue.append((node.right, level + 1))
    
    # Append the last level sum
    level_sums.append(current_sum)
    
    # If there are fewer than k levels, return -1
    if len(level_sums) < k:
        return -1
    
    # Sort sums and find the kth largest
    level_sums.sort(reverse=True)
    return level_sums[k - 1]

# Helper function to build the tree based on level fast input
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

# Example usage:
# root = TreeNode(5)
# root.left = TreeNode(8)
# root.right = TreeNode(3)
# root.left.left = TreeNode(1)
# root.left.right = TreeNode(2)
# root.right.left = TreeNode(7)
# root.right.right = TreeNode(4)
# k = 2
# print(kth_largest_sum(root, k)) # Output should be 13
```

## Time Complexity

1. **BFS Traversal**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree, since each node is visited once.
2. **Sort Level Sums**: O(L log L), where L is the number of levels.
3. **Overall Complexity**: The dominant term is O(N), but sorting may add some additional time. If we assume the number of levels (L) is typically much smaller than the number of nodes (N), the overall complexity can still be approximated as O(N).
