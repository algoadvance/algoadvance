title:  Minimum Time to Visit Disappearing Nodes-out
permalink: /s3112
---

You are given a list of nodes where each node starts disappearing at a given timestamp. To visit a node, you need to start at that node at a timestamp before or at the given timestamp. Once you start at the node, you instantly travel to the next node and so on.

The problem requires you to determine the minimum amount of time you need to start visiting the nodes so that you can visit all nodes before they disappear. You can visit the nodes in any order.

Given:
- `n` - the number of nodes.
- `nodes[]` - an array where each element represents the timestamp a specific node disappears.

Your goal is to determine the minimum timestamp to start visiting nodes so you can visit all of them before they disappear.

# Clarifying Questions
1. Can the nodes be visited in any order?
2. What is the range of the timestamps?
3. Are the timestamps distinct?
4. Is there a unique solution for the problem?

# Strategy
1. **Sort Nodes**: First, sort the nodes based on their disappear timestamps.
2. **Visit Nodes**: Start visiting from the first node in the sorted list and adjust the starting time based on the disappear timestamp of each node sequentially.
3. Iterate through the sorted timestamps and adjust the starting time accordingly.

# Code

```python
def minimum_start_time(n, nodes):
    nodes.sort()  # Sort the timestamps
    start_time = 0  # Initialize start time to 0
    
    for i, disappear_time in enumerate(nodes):
        # We need to ensure that we reach this node on or before its disappear timestamp
        start_time = max(start_time, disappear_time - i)
    
    return start_time

# Example Usage:
n = 3
nodes = [10, 5, 7]
print(minimum_start_time(n, nodes))  # Output should be the minimum start time needed
```

# Time Complexity
- Sorting the nodes takes O(n log n).
- The iteration through the nodes takes O(n).
Overall, the time complexity is O(n log n).

This strategy ensures that we start our visits at the earliest possible time while still being able to visit all nodes before they disappear.
