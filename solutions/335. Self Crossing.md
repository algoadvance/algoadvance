You are given an array of positive integers `distance`. You start at `(0,0)` and move `distance[0]` units north, then `distance[1]` units west, `distance[2]` units south, `distance[3]` units east, and so on. In other words, always after the `i-th` move, your direction changes to (i % 4):
- 0: north,
- 1: west,
- 2: south,
- 3: east

Return `true` if your path crosses itself at any point, and `false` if it does not.

### Strategy
To determine if the given path crosses itself:
1. Iterate through the distances array.
2. Keep track of the path and the direction of movement.
3. Check various conditions where the path could cross itself based on the pattern of movement.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: Can we assume that the input list will always have at least one element?**
   - A: Yes, there's always at least one element in the `distance` array.
2. **Q: Are all distances positive integers?**
   - A: Yes, all elements in the `distance` array are positive integers.

### Code
```python
def isSelfCrossing(distance):
    n = len(distance)
    if n < 4:
        return False
    
    for i in range(3, n):
        # Case 1: Fourth line crosses first line
        if distance[i] >= distance[i - 2] and distance[i - 1] <= distance[i - 3]:
            return True
        # Case 2: Fifth line meets first line
        if i >= 4 and distance[i - 1] == distance[i - 3] and distance[i] + distance[i - 4] >= distance[i - 2]:
            return True
        # Case 3: Sixth line crosses first line
        if i >= 5 and distance[i - 2] >= distance[i - 4] and distance[i] + distance[i - 4] >= distance[i - 2] and distance[i - 1] <= distance[i - 3] and distance[i - 1] >= distance[i - 3] - distance[i - 5]:
            return True
    
    return False
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `distance` array. This is because we only pass through the array once and perform constant-time checks during each iteration.
