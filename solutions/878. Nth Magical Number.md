## Problem Statement
A positive integer is magical if it is divisible by either `a` or `b`.

Given three integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, return the `n`-th magical number. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Example:
- **Input:** `n = 1, a = 2, b = 3`
- **Output:** `2`
- **Explanation:** The first magical number is `2` as it is divisible by either `2` or `3`.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 10^9`
- `2 <= a, b <= 4 * 10^4`

## Clarifying Questions
1. How large can the numerical outputs be?
   - Since the answer can be very large, we need to return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
2. Can `a` and `b` be equal?
   - No specific constraints against it. If they are equal, it simplifies the problem since every multiple of `a` (or `b`) is a magical number.

## Strategy
The key insight here is to use a binary search approach along with some number theory:
1. **Binary Search:** We will use binary search to find the n-th magical number.
2. **LCM (Least Common Multiple) Calculation:** Since a number needs to be divisible by `a` or `b`, we should also consider multiples of their least common multiple (LCM). The LCM of `a` and `b` helps avoid over-counting numbers divisible by both `a` and `b`.

### Steps:
1. Define the search range for the binary search. The lower bound can be `1`, and the upper bound can be `n * min(a, b)`.
2. Use the binary search to find the smallest number `x` such that there are at least `n` magical numbers â‰¤ `x`.
3. Calculate the number of magical numbers <= `x` using the inclusion-exclusion principle:
   - Count numbers divisible by `a`, `b`, and their LCM.
4. Adjust the bounds of the binary search based on whether the count is greater than or less than `n`.

## Code
Here's the Python implementation of the solution:

```python
def nthMagicalNumber(n: int, a: int, b: int) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    
    # Helper to calculate gcd
    def gcd(x, y):
        while y:
            x, y = y, x % y
        return x

    # Least common multiple
    def lcm(x, y):
        return x * y // gcd(x, y)
    
    L = lcm(a, b)

    # Binary search for the nth magical number
    lo, hi = 1, n * min(a, b)
    while lo < hi:
        mid = (lo + hi) // 2
        # Count of magical numbers <= mid
        if (mid // a) + (mid // b) - (mid // L) < n:
            lo = mid + 1
        else:
            hi = mid
    
    return lo % MOD

# Example usage:
print(nthMagicalNumber(1, 2, 3))  # Output: 2
print(nthMagicalNumber(4, 2, 3))  # Output: 6
```

### Time Complexity
- **Binary Search Complexity:** \(O(\log(n \times \min(a, b)))\)
- **Inclusion-Exclusion Counting:** \(O(1)\)
Thus, the overall time complexity is primarily dominated by the binary search, leading to \(O(\log(n \times \min(a, b)))\). This is efficient given the constraints.
