title:  Find Subarrays With Equal Sum-out
permalink: /s2395
---

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. Determine whether there exist **two** subarrays of length `2` with equal sum. Note that `subarrays` must not overlap.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [4,2,4]
Output: true
Explanation: The subarrays (4,2) and (2,4) have the same sum of 6.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: false
Explanation: There are no two subarrays of length 2 that have the same sum.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [0,0,0]
Output: true
Explanation: The subarrays (0,0) and (0,0) have the same sum of 0.
```

**Constraints:**
- `2 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the subarrays overlap?
   - No, the subarrays must not overlap.

2. Do we need to find and return the subarrays or just determine if such subarrays exist?
   - We only need to determine if such subarrays exist and return `True` or `False`.

3. What should we return if the array length is less than 2?
   - This constraint is not needed as per the problem constraints. The minimum length for `nums` is 2.

## Strategy

1. Iterate through the list `nums` to calculate the sums of all subarrays of length 2.
2. Use a set to store these sums.
3. As we compute the sum of each subarray of length 2, check if the sum already exists in the set.
4. If it does, return `True`.
5. If not, add the sum to the set.
6. If we finish the iteration without finding any duplicate sums, return `False`.

This approach ensures we check for equal subarray sums efficiently, leveraging the properties of a set for O(1) average time complexity for lookups and insertions.

## Code

```python
def findSubarrays(nums):
    seen_sums = set()
    
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
        current_sum = nums[i] + nums[i + 1]
        if current_sum in seen_sums:
            return True
        seen_sums.add(current_sum)
    
    return False

# Test cases
print(findSubarrays([4, 2, 4]))    # Should return True
print(findSubarrays([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]))  # Should return False
print(findSubarrays([0, 0, 0]))   # Should return True
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`. We iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), in the worst case, if all subarray sums are unique, we will store them in the `seen_sums` set.

This ensures the solution is efficient and scales well within the problem's constraints.
