title:  Minimum Path Sum-out
permalink: /s64
---

You are given an `m x n` grid filled with non-negative numbers, representing a cost grid where you need to find a path that minimizes the cost from the top-left cell (0, 0) to the bottom-right cell (m-1, n-1). You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

The task is to determine the minimum path sum.

**Example:**

```
Input: grid = [[1,3,1],[1,5,1],[4,2,1]]
Output: 7
Explanation: Because the path 1 → 3 → 1 → 1 → 1 minimizes the sum.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the values in the grid be zero?
   - **A:** Yes, the values can be zero but they are non-negative.
   
2. **Q:** Are we guaranteed that the grid has at least one row and one column?
   - **A:** Yes, the input will be a non-empty grid.

### Strategy

This is a classic dynamic programming problem where we need to find the minimum cost path from the top-left to the bottom-right cell. The approach will be as follows:

1. **Initialization:** 
   - Create a 2D list `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum path sum to reach cell `(i, j)`.
   
2. **Base Case:**
   - The cost to reach the starting cell `(0, 0)` is just the value of that cell: `dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]`.
   
3. **DP Transition:**
   - For the first row and the first column, the only way to reach these cells is from their left (for row) or top (for column).
   - For all other cells `(i, j)`, we can arrive either from the left `(i, j-1)` or from above `(i-1, j)`.
   - Thus, `dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.

4. **Result:**
   - The value at `dp[m-1][n-1]` will give us the minimum path sum from the top-left to the bottom-right cell.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n)` where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(m * n)` for the `dp` array. This can be optimized to `O(n)` if we just use a single row for updates.

### Code

```python
def minPathSum(grid):
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0
    
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    
    dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]
    
    # Initialize first column
    for i in range(1, m):
        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][0]
    
    # Initialize first row
    for j in range(1, n):
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + grid[0][j]
    
    # Fill the dp table
    for i in range(1, m):
        for j in range(1, n):
            dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])
    
    return dp[m-1][n-1]
```

In this implementation, we fill out a dynamic programming table that records the minimum path sum to each cell `(i, j)`. By the time we process all cells, we can return the value at the last cell for the final minimum path sum.
