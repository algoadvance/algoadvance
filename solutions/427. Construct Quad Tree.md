title:  Construct Quad Tree-out
permalink: /s427
---

The problem is to construct a Quad-Tree representation of a given 2D matrix grid. A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. The Quad-Tree is used to represent a two-dimensional spatial hierarchy.

The class QuadTreeNode should be defined as follows:

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, isLeaf, topLeft, topRight, bottomLeft, bottomRight):
        self.val = val  # represents whether the node is a leaf and the value 0/1 if it is a leaf
        self.isLeaf = isLeaf  # boolean value to indicate whether it's a leaf node
        self.topLeft = topLeft  # top left child
        self.topRight = topRight  # top right child
        self.bottomLeft = bottomLeft  # bottom left child
        self.bottomRight = bottomRight  # bottom right child
```

The `construct` function should be defined as follows:

```python
def construct(grid: List[List[int]]) -> 'Node':
```

The function constructs a Quad-Tree for the given 2D matrix grid and returns the root of the Quad-Tree.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Grid Dimensions:**
   - Can the grid be non-square? (Assuming it is always a power of 2 square for forming a balanced Quad-Tree)
   
2. **Values in Grid:**
   - Are the values in the grid always either `0` or `1`? (Assuming so)

3. **Empty Grid:**
   - What should be the output if the grid is empty? (Assuming it won't be empty given the constraints)

If these assumptions hold, we can proceed with solving the problem.

### Strategy

1. **Base Case:**
   - If the grid has only one element, create a leaf node with that element.

2. **Recursive Divide and Conquer:**
   - For larger grids, divide the grid into four quadrants:
     - Top-left
     - Top-right
     - Bottom-left
     - Bottom-right
   - Recursively construct Quad-Trees for each quadrant.
   - If all four children are leaf nodes and have the same value, merge them into a single leaf node.
   - Otherwise, create a parent node with the four children.

3. **Helper Function:**
   - Write a helper function to check if all elements in a given subgrid are the same. This helps in determining if a node should be a leaf.

### Code

```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, isLeaf, topLeft=None, topRight=None, bottomLeft=None, bottomRight=None):
        self.val = val
        self.isLeaf = isLeaf
        self.topLeft = topLeft
        self.topRight = topRight
        self.bottomLeft = bottomLeft
        self.bottomRight = bottomRight

def construct(grid):
    def isUniform(x, y, length):
        value = grid[x][y]
        for i in range(x, x + length):
            for j in range(y, y + length):
                if grid[i][j] != value:
                    return False, None
        return True, value

    def constructRecursively(x, y, length):
        is_uni, value = isUniform(x, y, length)
        if is_uni:
            return Node(value == 1, True)
        
        half = length // 2
        topLeft = constructRecursively(x, y, half)
        topRight = constructRecursively(x, y + half, half)
        bottomLeft = constructRecursively(x + half, y, half)
        bottomRight = constructRecursively(x + half, y + half, half)

        if (topLeft.isLeaf and topRight.isLeaf and bottomLeft.isLeaf and bottomRight.isLeaf and
            topLeft.val == topRight.val == bottomLeft.val == bottomRight.val):
            return Node(topLeft.val, True)
        else:
            return Node(True, False, topLeft, topRight, bottomLeft, bottomRight)

    n = len(grid)
    if n == 0:
        return None
    return constructRecursively(0, 0, n)

```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is `O(n^2 log n)`:
  - `O(n^2)` for checking uniformity and copying sub-grids.
  - The division and recursive construction contribute the `log n` factor due to the binary splitting of the grid size.
