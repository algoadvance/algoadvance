Implement the function `double myPow(double x, int n)` that calculates `x` raised to the power `n` (i.e., `x^n`). Be careful of overflow for large values of `n`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Can `n` be negative?
   **A**: Yes, `n` can be negative, and in such cases, we need to return \(1 / x^{-n}\).
   
2. **Q**: What is the range for `x` and `n`?
   **A**: `x` is a double, and `n` is a 32-bit signed integer.

3. **Q**: How should we handle edge cases, like \( x = 0 \) or \( n = 0 \)?
   **A**: Any number raised to 0 is 1. \(0^0 \text{ is traditionally considered to be 1}\).

### Strategy

1. **Base Cases**:
   - If \( n == 0 \): Return 1 (since any number raised to the power 0 is 1).
   - If \( n < 0 \): Compute the positive power and take the reciprocal.
   
2. **Recursive or Iterative Approach**:
   - For efficient calculation, use the method of **Exponentiation by Squaring**.
   - This reduces the time complexity significantly by breaking the count into halves recursively or iteratively.

### Code

Let's write the code using an iterative approach with Exponentiation by Squaring for better efficiency.

```python
def myPow(x: float, n: int) -> float:
    if n == 0:
        return 1.0
    if n < 0:
        x = 1 / x
        n = -n

    result = 1.0
    current_product = x

    while n > 0:
        if n % 2 == 1:
            result *= current_product
        current_product *= current_product
        n //= 2

    return result
```
### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n), because we are reducing the power by half at each step due to the divide-by-2 operation.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), because we are not using recursive calls, thus no extra space on the call stack.

This approach ensures that the function efficiently handles large values of `n`, including negative powers.
