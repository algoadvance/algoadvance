title:  Maximum Tastiness of Candy Basket-out
permalink: /s2517
---

You have an array of candy's tastiness values, `candies`, and an integer `k`, representing the number of candies to pick. The goal is to maximize the minimum tastiness difference between any two selected candies.

Here's the problem statement from LeetCode:

You are given an array `candies` where `candies[i]` represents the tastiness of the i-th candy and an integer `k`. You need to select `k` candies in such a way that the minimum difference between any two selected candies' tastiness is maximized.

Return the maximum possible minimum difference.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Will there always be at least `k` candies?**
   - Yes, you can assume `k` will always be less than or equal to the length of the `candies` array.
   
2. **What should we return if we cannot find a valid selection?**
   - The constraints ensure that a valid selection is always possible.

3. **What is the range of values for tastiness and `k`?**
   - You can assume the tastiness values are within the integer limit and that `2 <= k <= len(candies)`.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can perform a **binary search** on the answer. Here's a step-by-step strategy:

1. **Sort the candies by their tastiness values:** The sorted order will help us easily compute potential differences.
  
2. **Binary search on the difference:** 
   - Define the range for the binary search: the minimum possible difference (`low`) is 0, and the maximum possible difference (`high`) is the difference between the maximum and minimum tastiness in the `candies` array.
   
3. **Verify if a given difference is achievable:**
   - For a mid value in binary search, check if it's possible to pick `k` candies such that the minimum difference between any two picked candies is at least `mid`.
   - This can be done using a greedy approach: traverse the sorted list and try to pick candies ensuring the current selected candyâ€™s minimum difference from the last picked candy is at least `mid`.

4. **Update the binary search range based on feasibility:**
   - If the mid difference is feasible, it implies we can try for a larger difference (`low = mid + 1`).
   - If not, reduce the difference (`high = mid - 1`).

## Code

```python
def maximumTastiness(candies, k):
    candies.sort()
    
    def canPickWithMinDiff(min_diff):
        count = 1
        last_picked = candies[0]
        
        for i in range(1, len(candies)):
            if candies[i] - last_picked >= min_diff:
                count += 1
                last_picked = candies[i]
                if count == k:
                    return True
        return False

    low, high = 0, candies[-1] - candies[0]
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if canPickWithMinDiff(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1

    return high

# Example usage
candies = [1, 3, 6, 13, 20]
k = 3
print(maximumTastiness(candies, k))  # Output will depend on the given candies and k.
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Sorting the `candies` array:** This takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of candies.
2. **Binary search:** This takes \(O(\log D)\), where \(D\) is the range of the difference (i.e., `candies[-1] - candies[0]`).
3. **Greedy check for each mid in binary search:** This takes \(O(n)\).

Hence, the total time complexity is \(O(n \log n + n \log D)\), which effectively simplifies to \(O(n \log n)\) since \(\log D\) is small compared to \(n \log n\).

This approach ensures that we maximize the minimum tastiness difference while being efficient for practical input sizes.
