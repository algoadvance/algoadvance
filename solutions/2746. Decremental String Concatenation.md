title:  Decremental String Concatenation-out
permalink: /s2746
---

The task is to implement a function `minimize_concatenated_length` to minimize the length of the string obtained by concatenating all strings in a given list in an optimal order. The concatenation operation can be represented by the `+` operator. The order of concatenation can affect the resulting string length due to overlapping substrings.

### Function Signature

```python
def minimize_concatenated_length(words: List[str]) -> int:
    pass
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the list of words guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Typically, yes, but should be clarified if handling an empty list is necessary.

2. **Can the list contain duplicate strings?**
   - Yes, duplicate strings are allowed.

3. **Is there any upper limit to the length of each word or the size of the list?**
   - Usually, constraints around length or size could exist to frame efficient algorithms.

4. **Can words have spaces or special characters?**
   - Assume only lowercase alphabets unless specified otherwise.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need a strategy that essentially tries to minimize the lengths of the intermediate concatenated strings, often leveraging overlapping characters between the ends and starts of concatenated words.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:

1. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Use a dynamic programming (DP) approach where `dp[i]` represents the minimal length of the string formed by concatenating the first `i` words optimally.

2. **Recursive Choice**:
   - For each word, decide the optimal next word to concatenate based on the overlap.

3. **Memoization**:
   - Use memoization to store results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

### Pseudocode

1. Define a helper function to compute the overlap of two strings.
2. Define the main function using dynamic programming and memoization to compute the result.

### Code

```python
from typing import List

def minimize_concatenated_length(words: List[str]) -> int:
    n = len(words)
    
    # Memoization table to store the minimal length for each subset
    memo = {}
    
    def overlap(s1, s2):
        # function to get the length of the overlap between end of s1 and start of s2
        max_overlap = 0
        l1, l2 = len(s1), len(s2)
        max_overlap = min(l1, l2)
        
        # Find the maximum overlap
        for i in range(1, max_overlap + 1):
            if s1[-i:] == s2[:i]:
                return i
        return 0

    def dp(mask, last):
        if mask == (1 << n) - 1:
            # If all words are used, we are done
            return len(words[last])
        
        if (mask, last) in memo:
            return memo[(mask, last)]
        
        # Initialize the answer to a large value
        answer = float('inf')
        
        for i in range(n):
            if not mask & (1 << i):
                # If the i-th word is not used yet
                overl = overlap(words[last], words[i])
                answer = min(answer, len(words[last]) + dp(mask | (1 << i), i) - overl)
        
        # Save result in memo table and return
        memo[(mask, last)] = answer
        return answer
    
    # Try all words as the starting word
    min_length = float('inf')
    for i in range(n):
        min_length = min(min_length, dp(1 << i, i))

    return min_length

# Example usage:
words = ["abc", "bcd", "cde"]
print(minimize_concatenated_length(words))  # Expected output is optimal concatenated length
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2 * 2^n), considering we are exploring each possible subset of words with each possible previous word using bitmask DP. However, practical performance might be better due to memoization, especially if there is considerable overlap in common subproblems.
