title:  Find Missing Observations-out

You are given an integer array `rolls` of length `n` and an integer `mean`. The array `rolls` contains the result of rolling a fair 6-sided die `n` times.

Return an array of length `m` (with `0 <= m`), that contains the missing rolls completing the `rolls` such that the average value of the `n + m` rolls is `mean`. If there are multiple valid answers, return any of them. If it is impossible to obtain such an array, return an empty array.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: rolls = [3, 2, 4, 3], mean = 4, n = 4, m = 2
Output: [6, 6]
Explanation: The sum of rolls is 12, and their mean is 3. The two missing rolls have a total sum of 8 (since mean * (n + m) = 4 * 6 = 24). Since 8 is a valid sum that can be achieved with two dice rolls, we return [6, 2] or any other valid answer.

Input: rolls = [1, 5, 6], mean = 3, n = 3, m = 4
Output: [2, 3, 2, 2]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can `n` be equal to 0 or `m` be equal to 0?
    - No, it must be a valid array summing up to a non-trivial mean.
2. Can the array return in any order?
    - Yes, any valid answer is acceptable.
3. Will the input array only contain integers from 1 to 6?
    - Yes, because it must simulate a fair 6-sided die result.

### Strategy
1. Calculate the total sum required for `n + m` rolls: `total_sum = mean * (n + m)`.
2. Calculate the sum of the given `rolls`: `current_sum = sum(rolls)`.
3. The sum of the missing `m` rolls should equal `missing_sum = total_sum - current_sum`.
4. Verify that it's possible to achieve `missing_sum` with `m` rolls, where each roll is between 1 and 6.
    - The minimum sum achievable by `m` rolls is `m * 1`.
    - The maximum sum achievable by `m` rolls is `m * 6`.
5. If `missing_sum` is within the achievable range, distribute the `missing_sum` across the `m` rolls as evenly as possible, ensuring no roll is below 1 or above 6.
6. If not possible, return an empty array.

### Code
```python
def missingRolls(rolls, mean, m):
    n = len(rolls)
    total_sum = mean * (n + m)
    current_sum = sum(rolls)
    missing_sum = total_sum - current_sum
    
    # Check if missing_sum can be distributed evenly among m rolls
    if missing_sum < m * 1 or missing_sum > m * 6:
        return []
    
    # Initialize the result array with 1s
    result = [1] * m
    remaining_sum = missing_sum - m  # We have already added m ones
    
    # Distribute the remaining sum
    for i in range(m):
        if remaining_sum == 0:
            break
        add_val = min(5, remaining_sum)  # max we can add is 5 to each roll as it already has 1
        result[i] += add_val
        remaining_sum -= add_val
    
    return result

# Example Usage
print(missingRolls([3, 2, 4, 3], 4, 2))  # Should output any valid array like [6, 6]
print(missingRolls([1, 5, 6], 3, 4))    # Should output any valid array like [2, 3, 2, 2]
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(m)` where `m` is the number of missing rolls. Since the operations involve iterating over the `m` rolls to distribute the missing sum, it is dependent on `m`. The initialization of the list and subsequent updates are linear operations. The additional arithmetic and comparisons are `O(1)`.
