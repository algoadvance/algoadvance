title:  Insert Greatest Common Divisors in Linked List-out
permalink: /s2807
---

Given a linked list, you need to insert nodes with values representing the greatest common divisor (GCD) of consecutive nodes in the list. Specifically, for each consecutive node pair `(a, b)` in the list, insert a new node with the value of `gcd(a, b)` between these nodes. The function should return the modified linked list head.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the linked list have duplicate values?**
   - Yes, the linked list can have duplicate values.
   
2. **What should be returned if the list is empty or has only one node?**
   - If the list is empty or has only one node, return the head as is, since no GCD can be calculated.

3. **Are there any constraints on the values of the nodes?**
   - Typically, the values will be positive integers. We assume this here unless specified otherwise.

4. **What is the expected output format?**
   - The modified linked list should be returned.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Traverse the entire linked list.
2. For each pair of consecutive nodes, compute the GCD of their values.
3. Insert a new node with the computed GCD value between the two nodes.
4. Continue this process until all pairs have been processed.

### Code

Here's how we can implement the described strategy in Python:

```python
from math import gcd

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def insertGreatestCommonDivisors(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    if not head or not head.next:
        return head
    
    current = head
    
    while current and current.next:
        a = current.val
        b = current.next.val
        gcd_value = gcd(a, b)
        
        new_node = ListNode(gcd_value)
        new_node.next = current.next
        current.next = new_node
        
        # Move to the next original node (skipping the newly created node)
        current = new_node.next
    
    return head

# Helper functions to create and print the linked list (for testing purposes)
def create_linked_list(arr):
    if not arr:
        return None
    head = ListNode(arr[0])
    current = head
    for val in arr[1:]:
        current.next = ListNode(val)
        current = current.next
    return head

def print_linked_list(head):
    elems = []
    while head:
        elems.append(head.val)
        head = head.next
    print(elems)

# Example usage
arr = [2, 3, 4, 6]
head = create_linked_list(arr)
print("Original list:")
print_linked_list(head)
print("Updated list with GCDs inserted:")
updated_head = insertGreatestCommonDivisors(head)
print_linked_list(updated_head)
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because we traverse the list once and perform constant-time operations (GCD calculation and node insertion) for each pair of consecutive nodes.

The space complexity is \(O(1)\) additional space (ignoring the space required for the new nodes which hold the GCD values). The additional nodes created are part of the output linked list.
