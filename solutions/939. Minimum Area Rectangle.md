title:  Minimum Area Rectangle-out
permalink: /s939
---

Given a set of points in the plane, determine the minimum area of a rectangle formed from these points, with sides parallel to the x and y axes. If there isn't any rectangle possible, return 0.

### Example:
```
Input: points = [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3],[2,2]]
Output: 4
```

Note that the coordinates are all integers and can have negative values. 

### Constraints:
- 1 <= points.length <= 40000
- 0 <= points[i][0], points[i][1] <= 40000

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all the points unique?**
   - Yes, the problem specifies that all provided points are unique.

2. **Is it possible that there are no rectangles?**
   - Yes, in such cases, we should return 0 as the output.

3. **Are the rectangle sides always parallel to the x and y axes?**
   - Yes, the sides of the rectangle are always parallel to the axes.

## Strategy

1. Use a set to store all the points for quick lookup.
2. Iterate through each pair of points and check if they can form the diagonal of a rectangle.
3. For each pair of points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)`, ensure `x1 != x2` and `y1 != y2` to form a valid diagonal.
4. Check if both `(x1, y2)` and `(x2, y1)` exist in the point set.
5. Calculate the area and update the minimum area.
6. Return the minimum area found or 0 if no rectangle is possible.

## Code

```python
def minAreaRect(points):
    point_set = set(map(tuple, points))
    min_area = float('inf')
    n = len(points)
    
    for i in range(n):
        x1, y1 = points[i]
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            x2, y2 = points[j]
            if x1 != x2 and y1 != y2:
                if (x1, y2) in point_set and (x2, y1) in point_set:
                    area = abs(x1 - x2) * abs(y1 - y2)
                    min_area = min(min_area, area)
    
    return 0 if min_area == float('inf') else min_area

# Example usage
points = [[1,1],[1,3],[3,1],[3,3],[2,2]]
print(minAreaRect(points))  # Output: 4
```

## Time Complexity

Given `n` as the number of points:
- Converting list to set: \( O(n) \)
- Checking pairs of points and potential rectangles: \( O(n^2) \)
- The nested loops iterate over all pairs of points which makes the algorithm \( O(n^2) \).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \( O(n^2) \), which should be efficient enough given the constraints.

In practice, this approach efficiently identifies the smallest rectangle area or determines if no rectangle exists by taking advantage of the hash set for quick point lookups.
