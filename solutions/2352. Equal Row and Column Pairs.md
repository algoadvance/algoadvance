title:  Equal Row and Column Pairs-out
permalink: /s2352
---
Given a 0-indexed n x n integer matrix `grid`, return the number of pairs `(r, c)` such that row `r` and column `c` are equal.

A row and a column pair are considered equal if they contain the same elements in the same order.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the size of the matrix `n`?**
   - Typically, these constraints are provided to judge the feasible approach. E.g., `1 <= n <= 200`.

2. **Can the matrix contain negative numbers or zeros?**
   - Establishing the range of matrix values could help in deciding if there are any special cases to handle.

3. **Is the order of elements within the row and the column important?**
   - Based on the problem statement, order is important.

### Strategy
1. **Iterate Through Rows and Columns**
   - Extract each row and column from the matrix and compare them.

2. **Tuple Comparison**
   - Convert lists to tuples for O(1) comparison instead of list comparison which might be costly.

3. **Dictionary for Storage**
   - Store rows in a dictionary with counts to efficiently check and compare with columns.

### Code

```python
def equalPairs(grid):
    row_count = {}
    n = len(grid)
    
    # Store row occurrences in dictionary
    for row in grid:
        row_tuple = tuple(row)
        if row_tuple in row_count:
            row_count[row_tuple] += 1
        else:
            row_count[row_tuple] = 1
    
    # Compare with columns
    count = 0
    for c in range(n):
        col_tuple = tuple(grid[r][c] for r in range(n))
        if col_tuple in row_count:
            count += row_count[col_tuple]
    
    return count

# Example usage
grid = [
    [3, 2, 1],
    [1, 7, 6],
    [2, 7, 7]
]
print(equalPairs(grid))  # Output: 1
```

### Explanation
1. **count occurrence of tuples for each row**: This helps in comparing the rows efficiently with columns. Tuples are hashable and can be keys in a dictionary.
2. **map rows** in a dictionary with their counts.
3. **generate columns as tuples** and compare it to the stored rows in the dictionary.
4. Aggregate the counts from the dictionary for matches.

### Time Complexity
- **Storing Rows in Dictionary**: O(n^2) for n rows of length n.
- **Comparing Columns with Rows**: O(n^2) (constructing each column is O(n) and further checking in dictionary is O(1)).

Total time complexity is `O(n^2)`. This is efficient enough for the given constraint of `n <= 200`.
