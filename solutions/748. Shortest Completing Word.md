The problem statement for LeetCode 748: Shortest Completing Word is as follows:

Given a string licensePlate and an array of strings words, find the shortest completing word in words. A completing word is a word that contains all the letters in licensePlate (ignoring numbers and case). If multiple completing words are found, return the shortest one. If there is a tie, return the first one that appears in the given array 'words'.

### Example:
```text
Input: licensePlate = "1s3 PSt", words = ["step", "steps", "stripe", "stepple"]
Output: "steps"
```

### Note:
- A license plate consists of digits, spaces, and letters.
- Completing words are case-insensitive and should ignore non-letter characters in the license plate.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Should we consider digits in the `licensePlate` for forming the completing words?
   - No, we ignore digits and special characters in `licensePlate`.
2. How do we handle case sensitivity for the `licensePlate`?
   - Case should be ignored, meaning both 'A' and 'a' should be considered the same.
3. What should we do if there are multiple words that are the shortest and completing?
   - Return the first one that appears in the given array `words`.

## Strategy

1. **Extract Letters**: Extract only alphabetic characters from the `licensePlate` and convert them to lowercase.
2. **Count Frequencies**: Count the frequency of each character in the filtered `licensePlate`.
3. **Check Completeness**: For each word in the `words` array:
   - Convert the word to lowercase.
   - Count the frequency of each character.
   - Check if the word contains at least the counts specified by the `licensePlate` frequency.
4. **Find Shortest**: Keep track of the shortest completing word.

## Code

Below is the Python solution to solve the problem:

```python
from collections import Counter

def shortestCompletingWord(licensePlate, words):
    # Filter and count letters from the license plate
    license_count = Counter(char.lower() for char in licensePlate if char.isalpha())
    
    def is_completing(word):
        word_count = Counter(word)
        for char, count in license_count.items():
            if word_count[char] < count:
                return False
        return True
    
    shortest_word = None
    for word in words:
        lower_word = word.lower()
        if is_completing(lower_word):
            if shortest_word is None or len(word) < len(shortest_word):
                shortest_word = word
    
    return shortest_word

# Example usage
licensePlate = "1s3 PSt"
words = ["step", "steps", "stripe", "stepple"]
print(shortestCompletingWord(licensePlate, words)) # Output: "steps"
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Extract Letters**: O(n) where n is the length of `licensePlate`.
2. **Count Frequencies**: O(m) where m is the total number of characters in the words list.
3. **Check Completeness**: For each word (assuming there are `w` words each of maximum length `l`), it takes O(l) to check frequency completeness.
4. **Find Shortest**: O(w * l) due to iterating through all words and comparing lengths.

Overall, the complexity is `O(n + m + w*l)`, which can be approximated as `O(w*l)` in scenarios where the length of `licensePlate` and the number of words is significantly smaller compared to the total characters in all words combined.
