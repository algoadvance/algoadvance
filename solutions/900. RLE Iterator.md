(From LeetCode #900 "RLE Iterator")

Write an iterator that iterates through a run-length encoded sequence.

The iterator is initialized by `RLEIterator(int[] A)`, where `A` is a run-length encoded array of even length. Specifically, for all even indices `i`, `A[i]` tells us the number of times that the non-negative integer value `A[i + 1]` is repeated in the sequence.

The iterator supports one function: `next(int n)`, which exhausts the next `n` elements (`n` >= 1) and returns the last element exhausted in this way. If there is no element left to exhaust, `next` returns `-1` instead.

In other words, `next`(n)`` returns the last `element` of the next `n` elements. 
Note that `n` is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: ["RLEIterator","next","next","next","next"], 
       [[[3,8,0,9,2,5]], [2], [1], [1], [2]]
Output: [null,8,8,5,-1]
Explanation:
RLEIterator rle = new RLEIterator([3,8,0,9,2,5]);
rle.next(2); // exhausts 2 terms of the sequence, returns 8.
rle.next(1); // exhausts the next 1 term of the sequence, returns 8.
rle.next(1); // exhausts the next 1 term of the sequence, returns 5.
rle.next(2); // pass returns -1 because there are only 1 term left in the sequence.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What constraints are placed on the size of the array `A` and the values it contains?**

   - The length of `A` is guaranteed to be even, representing pairs of [frequency, value].
   - Frequency values (`A[i]`) and the integers (`A[i + 1]`) are non-negative.

2. **Can the frequency of elements be zero?**

   - Yes, frequencies can be zero, which means those elements do not appear in the sequence.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization (`__init__` method)**
   - Initialize by storing the input array `A` and setting an index pointer to track the current position in `A`.

2. **Next method (`next` method)**
   - Process elements from `A` based on the frequency.
   - Decrement the frequency while advancing the iterator.
   - If the frequency for a given value is exhausted, move to the next value.
   - Return the last value reached or `-1` if there are not enough elements left in the sequence.

### Code

```python
class RLEIterator:
    
    def __init__(self, A):
        self.data = A
        self.index = 0   # This will keep track of the current position in the encoded array
    
    def next(self, n):
        while self.index < len(self.data):
            if self.data[self.index] >= n:  # sufficient elements in the current run
                self.data[self.index] -= n
                return self.data[self.index + 1]
            else:
                n -= self.data[self.index]  # exhaust all elements in the current run
                self.index += 2  # move to the next pair
        
        return -1

# Example usage:
rle = RLEIterator([3,8,0,9,2,5])
print(rle.next(2))  # returns 8
print(rle.next(1))  # returns 8
print(rle.next(1))  # returns 5
print(rle.next(2))  # returns -1
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization (`__init__`)**: O(1) – Simply setting up the initial state, which takes constant time.
  
- **Next method (`next`)**: O(n) – In the worst-case, we might need to scan through each element in the array if `n` is large and there are many runs with zero or small counts. Here `n` refers to the number of elements to pick, not the size of the input array.

The approach ensures that each call to `next` efficiently manages the run-length encoded sequence by leveraging the inherent structure of the data (frequency-value pairs).
