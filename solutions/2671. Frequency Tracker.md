LeetCode Problem 2671: **Frequency Tracker**

Design a data structure that keeps track of the frequencies of elements in a list and allows querying of the number of elements that have a specific frequency.

Implement the `FrequencyTracker` class:

- `FrequencyTracker()` Initializes the FrequencyTracker object.
- `add(num: int) -> None` Adds `num` to the data structure.
- `deleteOne(num: int) -> None` Deletes one occurrence of `num` from the data structure. If `num` is not present in the data structure, do nothing.
- `hasFrequency(frequency: int) -> bool` Returns `True` if there is at least one element in the data structure that has the exact `frequency`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Should the `deleteOne` method handle decrementing the count appropriately even if the number’s count becomes 0?
   - Yes, once a counter for a number reaches zero, it should be removed from the records.
   
2. Can we assume that the input numbers for `add` and `deleteOne` are integers?
   - Yes, you can assume that the input numbers will be integers.

3. Should the `hasFrequency` method handle cases where the frequency is negative or non-integer?
   - No, you can assume all frequency queries will be non-negative integers.

### Code

Let's proceed to the implementation of the `FrequencyTracker` class:

```python
class FrequencyTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.num_count = {}  # Dictionary to track the count of each number.
        self.freq_count = {} # Dictionary to track how many numbers have a specific frequency.
    
    def _update_freq_count(self, frequency, increment):
        # Update the freq_count dictionary.
        if frequency in self.freq_count:
            self.freq_count[frequency] += increment
            if self.freq_count[frequency] == 0:
                del self.freq_count[frequency]
        elif increment > 0:
            self.freq_count[frequency] = increment
    
    def add(self, num: int) -> None:
        if num in self.num_count:
            current_count = self.num_count[num]
            self._update_freq_count(current_count, -1)
            self.num_count[num] += 1
            self._update_freq_count(current_count + 1, 1)
        else:
            self.num_count[num] = 1
            self._update_freq_count(1, 1)
    
    def deleteOne(self, num: int) -> None:
        if num in self.num_count:
            current_count = self.num_count[num]
            self._update_freq_count(current_count, -1)
            if current_count == 1:
                del self.num_count[num]
            else:
                self.num_count[num] -= 1
                self._update_freq_count(current_count - 1, 1)
    
    def hasFrequency(self, frequency: int) -> bool:
        return frequency in self.freq_count

```

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Create two dictionaries:
   - `num_count` to keep track of the count of each number.
   - `freq_count` to keep track of how many numbers have a specific frequency.
   
2. **Updating Frequency Counts**: Helper method `_update_freq_count` to safely update `freq_count` with increment/decrement operations, ensuring we don’t maintain zero-value keys.

3. **Add Operation**: When adding a number:
   - Increment the count in `num_count`.
   - Adjust `freq_count` based on old and new counts.
   
4. **Delete Operation**: When deleting a number:
   - Decrement the count in `num_count` if the number exists.
   - Adjust `freq_count` accordingly and remove the number if its count drops to zero.
   
5. **Check Frequency**: Simply checking if the frequency exists in `freq_count`.

### Time Complexity

- **add**: O(1) - Dictionary operations are average O(1).
- **deleteOne**: O(1) - Same as add, adjusts counts in dictionaries.
- **hasFrequency**: O(1) - Simple dictionary lookup.

This approach ensures efficient updates and lookups for the expected operations.
