title:  Minimum Number of Operations to Satisfy Conditions-out
permalink: /s3122
---

You are given an array of `n` integers. You need to perform a series of operations to convert the array into a "Good Array". An array is called "Good" if the array satisfies the following conditions:

1. The array consists of only two distinct elements.
2. These two distinct elements alternate in the array.

You need to determine the minimum number of operations required to make the array a "Good Array". In one operation, you can change any element in the array to any other element.

### Example:
- Input: [1, 2, 2, 1, 2]
- Output: 1
- Explanation: Change the last element to `1`, resulting in [1, 2, 2, 1, 1].

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the array be empty?
   - No, the problem implies that the array has at least one element.
2. What are the constraints on the values of the elements in the array?
   - The problem doesn't specify, so assume they are integers.
3. Are there any constraints on the length of the array?
   - The problem doesn't specify, so assume it can be as long as necessary.
4. Can there be negative numbers in the array?
   - Yes, since there are no constraints to suggest otherwise.

## Strategy

1. Identify two potential pairs of alternating elements:
   - Pair 1: (first_element, second_element)
   - Pair 2: (second_element, first_element)
2. For each of these pairs, calculate the number of changes required to achieve the alternating pattern.
3. The result will be the minimum number of changes required between the two pairs.

### Steps:
1. Identify the first and second elements in the array.
2. Compute the required changes for two potential alternating patterns.
3. Return the minimum of these changes.

## Code

```python
def minOperations(arr):
    if not arr:
        return 0
    
    n = len(arr)
    
    first_elem = arr[0]
    second_elem = None
    
    # Finding the second element
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] != first_elem:
            second_elem = arr[i]
            break
            
    if second_elem is None:
        return n  # If all elements are same, we need n changes

    # Count changes needed for two alternating patterns
    changes1 = 0
    changes2 = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            if arr[i] != first_elem:
                changes1 += 1
            if arr[i] != second_elem:
                changes2 += 1
        else:
            if arr[i] != second_elem:
                changes1 += 1
            if arr[i] != first_elem:
                changes2 += 1
    
    return min(changes1, changes2)

# Example
print(minOperations([1, 2, 2, 1, 2]))  # Output: 1
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array. This is because we go through the array a couple of times to find the second distinct element and then to count the necessary changes.
- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since we are only using a fixed amount of additional space.

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum number of operations required to satisfy the conditions of making the array a "Good Array".
