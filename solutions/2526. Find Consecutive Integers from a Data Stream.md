title:  Find Consecutive Integers from a Data Stream-out
permalink: /s2526
---

You are given a data stream input of integers, and you need to determine if there are any instances where a number and its immediate previous numbers are all consecutive. Specifically, write a class `DataStream` which contains the following methods:

1. `__init__(k: int)` - Initializes the stream with a parameter k which denotes the number of previous integers (inclusive of the current one) to check if they are consecutive.
2. `add(num: int) -> bool` - Adds `num` to the stream and returns whether the last `k` added integers are consecutive.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the integers in the stream strictly increasing?**
   - No, the integers can be in any order.

2. **What is the expected range and length of input integers?**
   - The exact range and length aren't specified, but it should be handled efficiently.

3. **What should we do if fewer than `k` numbers have been added to the stream?**
   - If there are fewer than `k` integers in the stream, `add` should return `False`.

Given this understanding, let's proceed with a solution.

### Strategy

1. **Data Storage**: Use a list to store the integers in the stream.
2. **Add method logic**:
    - Append the integer to the list.
    - If the listâ€™s length is less than `k`, return `False`.
    - Sort the last `k` elements and check if they are consecutive:
        - Consecutive elements should have differences of `1`.
3. **Optimize Check**:
    - Instead of sorting every time, we can keep track of the last `k` elements to minimize the overhead.

### Time Complexity

- **Adding a number**: O(1)
- **Checking consecutive**: O(k log k) for sorting or O(k) if we use a more efficient method.

### Code

Here is the implementation:

```python
class DataStream:
    def __init__(self, k: int):
        # Initialize with k and a list to store the stream data
        self.k = k
        self.stream = []
    
    def add(self, num: int) -> bool:
        # Add the number to the stream
        self.stream.append(num)
        
        # If less than k elements, return False
        if len(self.stream) < self.k:
            return False
        
        # Get the last k elements
        last_k_elements = self.stream[-self.k:]
        
        # Sort the last k elements
        last_k_elements.sort()
        
        # Check for consecutive numbers
        for i in range(1, self.k):
            if last_k_elements[i] != last_k_elements[i - 1] + 1:
                return False
        
        return True

# Example usage:
k = 3
data_stream = DataStream(k)
print(data_stream.add(1))  # False
print(data_stream.add(2))  # False
print(data_stream.add(3))  # True
print(data_stream.add(4))  # True
print(data_stream.add(5))  # True
print(data_stream.add(7))  # False
```

In this code:
- We initialize the `DataStream` with a given `k`.
- Each time we add a number, we check if the last `k` numbers are consecutive by sorting them and then checking the conditions.
- The method `add` ensures that it returns `True` if the last `k` numbers are consecutive; otherwise, it returns `False`. The approach is O(k log k) due to the sort, but this can be optimized further if needed.
