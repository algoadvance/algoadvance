title:  Find Two Non-overlapping Sub-arrays Each With Target Sum-out
permalink: /s1477
---
Given an array of integers `arr` and an integer target, return the minimum sum of the lengths of two non-overlapping sub-arrays such that the sum of each sub-array is equal to target. If there is no such sub-array, return -1.

A sub-array is a contiguous part of the array.

Example 1:
```
Input: arr = [3,2,2,4,3], target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: Only two sub-arrays have sum equal to 3: [3] and [3]. The minimum sum of their lengths is 2.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: arr = [7,3,4,7], target = 7
Output: 2
Explanation: Although we have multiple ways to get sub-arrays of sum 7, only the first way gives the minimum sum of lengths: [7] and [7].
```

Example 3:
```
Input: arr = [4,3,2,6,2,3,4], target = 6
Output: -1
Explanation: We have only one sub-array of sum 6.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can elements in the array be negative? 
   - This can potentially alter the solution approach.
2. Are there constraints on the size of the array `arr` and the value of `target`?
3. Should the solution return the smallest possible combination of lengths if multiple pairs of sub-arrays exist?

### Strategy
We can use a sliding window technique along with two passes to determine the shortest sub-arrays that meet the target sum. We'll store these sub-arrays and their lengths, and then try to find combinations of non-overlapping sub-arrays to return the minimum total length. Follow these steps:

1. **Sliding Window Approach:** 
   - Utilize a dictionary to store the cumulative sums and their indices for quick reference.
   - Use sliding windows to find valid sub-arrays that achieve the target sum.

2. **Track Minimum Lengths:** 
   - Use arrays to store the minimum lengths ending at or starting from each index to help identify non-overlapping sub-arrays.

3. **Determine Non-overlapping Pairs:**
   - Iterate through the array to find and keep track of the two shortest non-overlapping sub-arrays that together achieve the target sum.

4. **Return the Result:** 
   - Combine the tracked lengths to find the smallest possible combination, returning that value.

### Code
```python
def minSumOfLengths(arr, target):
    n = len(arr)
    prefix_sum = 0
    min_len = float('inf')  # The minimum sum of lengths found
    best_till_now = [float('inf')] * n  # Minimum sub-array length till the current index
    
    # Dictionary to store the latest index of each prefix sum
    prefix_dict = {0: -1}
    
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum += arr[i]
        if prefix_sum - target in prefix_dict:
            start_index = prefix_dict[prefix_sum - target] + 1
            current_len = i - start_index + 1
            
            # If there's a sub-array before this with sum to target
            if start_index > 0 and best_till_now[start_index - 1] != float('inf'):
                min_len = min(min_len, best_till_now[start_index - 1] + current_len)
                
            best_till_now[i] = min(current_len, best_till_now[start_index - 1] if start_index > 0 else float('inf'))
        else:
            best_till_now[i] = best_till_now[i - 1] if i > 0 else float('inf')
        prefix_dict[prefix_sum] = i
        
    return -1 if min_len == float('inf') else min_len

# Example usage:
arr = [3, 2, 2, 4, 3]
target = 3
print(minSumOfLengths(arr, target))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because we are traversing the array at most twice:
1. Once for the sliding window to keep track of prefix sums and potential sub-array lengths.
2. And simultaneously to determine the minimum sum of lengths for non-overlapping sub-arrays.

The space complexity is O(n) due to the dictionary to store prefix sums and the array to store minimum lengths up to each index.
