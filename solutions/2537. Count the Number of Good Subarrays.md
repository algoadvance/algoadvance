title:  Count the Number of Good Subarrays-out
permalink: /s2537

### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, you need to return the number of good subarrays of `nums`. A subarray is defined as a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements in the array. A subarray is considered good if it has exactly `k` different integers.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What are the constraints on the array `nums`? For example, what is the maximum length of the array?
2. Are there any constraints on the values of the integers in `nums`?
3. Should the solution handle negative integers as well?
4. What is the expected time complexity for an optimal solution?

Assuming standard constraints on array length and integer values (e.g., array length up to 10^5), we can proceed with our approach.

### Strategy
1. **Sliding Window Approach with Hash Map**: 
   - We use a sliding window technique to find all subarrays with at most `k` distinct integers.
   - The number of subarrays with exactly `k` distinct integers can be derived from the count of subarrays with at most `k` distinct integers and the count of subarrays with at most `k-1` distinct integers.
   - Specifically: `num_good_subarrays = subarrays_at_most_k(nums, k) - subarrays_at_most_k(nums, k-1)`

2. **Helper Function**:
   - Define a helper function `subarrays_at_most_k(nums, k)` which will count the number of subarrays with at most `k` distinct integers using a sliding window and a dictionary to keep track of the frequency of elements.

### Code
Here's the Python implementation:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def subarrays_at_most_k(nums, k):
    count = 0
    left = 0
    freq = defaultdict(int)
    distinct_count = 0

    for right in range(len(nums)):
        if freq[nums[right]] == 0:
            distinct_count += 1
        freq[nums[right]] += 1

        while distinct_count > k:
            freq[nums[left]] -= 1
            if freq[nums[left]] == 0:
                distinct_count -= 1
            left += 1
        
        count += (right - left + 1)
    
    return count

def count_good_subarrays(nums, k):
    return subarrays_at_most_k(nums, k) - subarrays_at_most_k(nums, k-1)

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3]
k = 2
print(count_good_subarrays(nums, k))  # Output should be the number of good subarrays
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sliding Window** operation in helper function `subarrays_at_most_k` is O(n) because each element is added and removed from the window exactly once.
- **Overall Complexity** is O(n) because we perform two sliding window operations, which both individually run in O(n).

This approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of "good" subarrays by leveraging the properties of subarrays with at most `k` distinct integers.
