title:  The Number of Weak Characters in the Game-out
permalink: /s1996
---
You are playing a game that contains multiple characters, and each character has two main properties: attack and defense. You are given a 2D integer array `properties` where `properties[i] = [attack_i, defense_i]` represents the properties of the `i-th` character in the game.

A character is said to be weak if there exists another character who has both attack and defense levels strictly greater than this character's attack and defense levels. More formally, a character `i` is weak if there exists another character `j` such that `attack_j > attack_i` and `defense_j > defense_i`.

Return the number of weak characters in the game.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the size of the `properties` array?
   * **A:** Yes, the size of the array can be up to \(10^5\), and each attack and defense value is between 1 and \(10^5\).

2. **Q:** Is it possible for multiple characters to have the same attack and defense values?
   * **A:** Yes, characters can have the same attack and defense values.

3. **Q:** What should be returned if no character is weak?
   * **A:** If no character is weak, the function should return 0.

### Strategy
To determine if a character is weak, we need to compare it with other characters to check if there's another character with both higher attack and defense values. A straightforward comparison approach would be too slow given the constraints.

Let's break down an efficient solution in steps:
1. **Sort the characters**: 
   - Sort by attack in ascending order.
   - For characters with the same attack, sort by defense in descending order.
   
   This helps us manage scenarios where lower attack but potentially higher defense points come later in the sorted array.

2. **Track the highest defense**:
   - Traverse the sorted list in reverse order.
   - Keep track of the maximum defense encountered so far.
   - Compare each character’s defense with this maximum to determine if it’s weak.

3. **Count weak characters**:
   - For each character in the sorted list, if its defense is less than the maximum defense encountered so far, it is considered weak.

### Code
```python
def numberOfWeakCharacters(properties):
    # Step 1: Sort characters. First by attack ascending, then by defense descending.
    properties.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], -x[1]))

    # Step 2: Traverse the list in reverse to track the maximum defense encountered.
    max_defense = 0
    weak_characters = 0
    
    for attack, defense in reversed(properties):
        if defense < max_defense:
            weak_characters += 1
        max_defense = max(max_defense, defense)
    
    return weak_characters
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Traversal**: \(O(n)\)

The overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, resulting in \(O(n \log n)\). This is efficient given the problem constraints.

### Summary
This approach optimizes the comparison by sorting characters and then traversing them in such a way that enables us to keep track of the maximum defense level seen so far, which helps in quickly identifying and counting weak characters.
