title:  Count Ways To Build Good Strings-out
permalink: /s2466
---

You are given integers `zero`, `one`, `low`, and `high`. You have two types of strings: 

1. A string consisting of exactly `zero` consecutive '0's.
2. A string consisting of exactly `one` consecutive '1's.

Return the number of "good" strings that can be generated. A "good" string is defined as a string whose length is between `low` and `high` inclusive.

Since the answer can be large, return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we assume the inputs are always valid?**
   - Yes, we assume `zero`, `one`, `low`, and `high` are non-negative integers.
   
2. **Is it guaranteed that `low <= high`?**
   - Yes, that is the problem's constraint.

3. **Can the strings be concatenations of both '0' and '1' strings?**
   - Yes, the strings can be concatenations of both types.

4. **Is there any constraint on the order of '0' and '1' strings?**
   - No, there is no constraint. They can appear in any order as long as the length condition is met.

### Strategy

We can use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. We will define a function `dp[length]` that represents the number of ways to build a good string of exactly `length`.

1. **Initialization**: Start with `dp[0] = 1` because there is exactly one way to create a string of length 0, which is doing nothing.

2. **State Transition**:
   - For each position from `0` to `high`, decide if we can append a string of length `zero` or `one`:
     - If the current length is greater than or equal to `zero`, then we can add `dp[length - zero]` ways.
     - If the current length is greater than or equal to `one`, then we can add `dp[length - one]` ways.

3. **Final Step**:
   - Sum the values of `dp[length]` for all lengths from `low` to `high`.

### Code

Let's implement this strategy in Python:

```python
def countGoodStrings(low, high, zero, one):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    # Initialize the dp array with zeros. +1 to include 'high' as well.
    dp = [0] * (high + 1)
    # Base case
    dp[0] = 1
    
    # Fill dp array
    for length in range(1, high + 1):
        if length >= zero:
            dp[length] = (dp[length] + dp[length - zero]) % MOD
        if length >= one:
            dp[length] = (dp[length] + dp[length - one]) % MOD
    
    # Sum up all dp values from `low` to `high`
    result = 0
    for length in range(low, high + 1):
        result = (result + dp[length]) % MOD
    
    return result

# Example usage
low = 3
high = 3
zero = 1
one = 1
print(countGoodStrings(low, high, zero, one))  # Output: Expected number of good strings
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: \(O(high)\) for setting up the `dp` array.
- **DP Calculation**: Iterating over `high` and updating based on `zero` and `one` values, so \(O(high)\).
- **Final Summation**: Summing up values from `low` to `high`, which in the worst case is \(O(high)\).

So, the overall time complexity is \(O(high)\).

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is \(O(high)\) for storing the `dp` array.
