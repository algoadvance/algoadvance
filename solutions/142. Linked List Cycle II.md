### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Clarification:**
   - Are the values in the linked list nodes unique?
   - What should be returned if the linked list is empty?
   
2. **Cycle Details:**
   - Should the solution contain advanced cycle detection techniques like Floyd’s Tortoise and Hare algorithm?
   
3. **Constraints:**
   - Maximum length of the linked list?
   - Expected time and space complexity?

Assuming standard inputs and constraints as per typical LeetCode problems:

### Strategy
We can use Floyd’s Tortoise and Hare Algorithm to detect the start of the cycle in the linked list. The main idea is as follows:
1. Use two pointers, `slow` and `fast`. `slow` moves one step at a time while `fast` moves two steps at a time.
2. If there is a cycle, `slow` and `fast` will eventually meet inside the cycle.
3. Once they meet, to find the start of the cycle:
   1. Move `slow` to the head of the list.
   2. Move both `slow` and `fast` one step at a time; the node where they meet now is the start of the cycle.

### Code
Let's implement this in Python:

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list node.
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.next = None

def detectCycle(head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
    if not head or not head.next:
        return None

    slow, fast = head, head

    # Phase 1: Determine whether a cycle is present.
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow == fast:
            # Cycle detected
            break
    else:
        # No cycle detected
        return None

    # Phase 2: Find the start of the cycle.
    slow = head
    while slow != fast:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next
    
    return slow
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list:
1. Phase 1 (Cycle Detection): Both pointers traverse at most `O(n)` steps combined.
2. Phase 2 (Find Cycle Start): Both pointers traverse at most `O(n)` steps.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is `O(1)` because we only use a fixed amount of additional space (pointers).

By following this strategy and implementation, we ensure an efficient and clear solution to the problem.
