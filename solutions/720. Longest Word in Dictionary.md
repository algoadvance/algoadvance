title:  Longest Word in Dictionary-out
permalink: /s720
---

Given an array of strings `words` representing an English Dictionary, return the longest word in the dictionary that can be built one character at a time by other words in `words`.

If there is more than one possible answer, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["w","wo","wor","worl","world"]
Output: "world"
Explanation: The word "world" can be built one character at a time by "w", "wo", "wor", and "worl".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["a","banana","app","appl","ap","apply","apple"]
Output: "apple"
Explanation: Both "apply" and "apple" can be built from other words in the dictionary, but "apple" is lexicographically smaller.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 30`
- `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are there any duplicate words in the input array `words`?
2. Should we consider any specific conditions regarding the order of words?

## Strategy

1. **Sort the Words:**
   - First, sort the `words` array. This automatically ensures that if two words have the same length, they will be ordered lexicographically.
   
2. **Set for Fast Lookup:**
   - Use a set to store and quickly check if a word can be built from other words one character at a time.

3. **Iterate and Build:**
   - Initialize an empty string for the result.
   - Iterate through each word in the sorted list:
     - For each word that has all its prefixes in the set, check if it can become the new longest word.
     - Update the result accordingly.
     - Add the current word to the set for further checks.

4. **Output the Longest Word.**

## Code

```python
def longestWord(words):
    words.sort()
    word_set = set([""])
    longest_word = ""
    
    for word in words:
        if word[:-1] in word_set:
            word_set.add(word)
            if len(word) > len(longest_word):
                longest_word = word
    
    return longest_word

# Example usage:
words1 = ["w", "wo", "wor", "worl", "world"]
words2 = ["a", "banana", "app", "appl", "ap", "apply", "apple"]

print(longestWord(words1))  # Output: "world"
print(longestWord(words2))  # Output: "apple"
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Sorting:** `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of words in the `words` list.
2. **Iteration:** `O(n * k)` where `k` is the average length of the words (inserting and checking in a set operates on average O(1) time).

The total time complexity is `O(n log n + n * k)` which is efficient given the constraints.
