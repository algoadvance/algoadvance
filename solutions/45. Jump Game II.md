---

You are given an array of non-negative integers representing the maximum jump length from that position. Your goal is to reach the last index in the minimum number of jumps.

Write a function `jump(nums: List[int]) -> int` that takes an array `nums` and returns the minimum number of jumps required to reach the last index. 

**Example:**

```python
Input: nums = [2, 3, 1, 1, 4]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum number of jumps to reach the last index is 2. Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

**Note:**

- The length of the array will be at least 1.
- You can always reach the last index.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain a single element?**
   Yes, in such case, no jump is needed and the output should be 0.

2. **Does the input array guarantee that the last index is reachable from the first index?**
   Yes, we can assume that we can always reach the last index.

## Strategy

The idea is to use a greedy approach to solve this problem. We maintain a current end which tells us the farthest point that can be reached with the current number of jumps, and a farthest point which tells us the farthest point that can be reached with the next jump.

1. Initialize `jumps` to 0, `current_end` to 0, and `farthest` to 0.
2. Iterate over each index `i` of the array except the last one:
   - Update `farthest` to be the maximum of `farthest` and `i + nums[i]`.
   - If we have reached the `current_end`, increment `jumps` and update `current_end` to `farthest`.
3. Return the number of jumps.

By the end of the iteration, `jumps` will hold the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the last index.

## Code

```python
from typing import List

def jump(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    if len(nums) == 1:
        return 0
    
    jumps = 0
    current_end = 0
    farthest = 0
    
    for i in range(len(nums) - 1):
        farthest = max(farthest, i + nums[i])
        
        # if we have come to the end of our possible current jump
        if i == current_end:
            jumps += 1
            current_end = farthest
            
            # if the farthest we can currently reach includes the last element
            if current_end >= len(nums) - 1:
                break
    
    return jumps

# Example usage:
print(jump([2, 3, 1, 1, 4]))  # Output: 2
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because we make a single pass through the array to determine the number of jumps. The space complexity is O(1) since we are only using a constant amount of extra space.
