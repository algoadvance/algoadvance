title:  Print Binary Tree-out
permalink: /s655
---

Given the `root` of a binary tree, you need to construct a 2D list that contains the values of the tree nodes in a specific format. The format for constructing the 2D list is as follows:
- The height of the binary tree is `height`.
- The width of the 2D list is `2^height - 1`.
- The nodes are to be printed in a manner such that the root is centered in the top row, and each child node is centered below its parent. Empty cells are represented by `""`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**
   - What is the range of the number of nodes in the tree?
   - Can the tree be empty?
   
2. **Output Constraints**
   - Should the nodes be directly translated into strings?
   - How precisely should the empty cells be represented?

### Strategy

1. **Determine the Height** 
   - Traverse the tree to compute its height.

2. **Initialize the 2D List**
   - Use the height to calculate the width of the 2D list and initialize each cell to `""`.

3. **Fill the List**
   - Use a recursive function to place each node in its correct position. The position of the node is determined by the properties of the tree and the specific format required.

4. **Return the List**
   - After filling the 2D list as per the specification, return it.

### Code

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def printTree(root: TreeNode):
    # Function to compute the height of the tree
    def getHeight(node):
        if not node:
            return 0
        return 1 + max(getHeight(node.left), getHeight(node.right))

    # Function to fill the 2D list
    def fill(res, node, row, left, right):
        if not node:
            return
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        res[row][mid] = str(node.val)
        fill(res, node.left, row + 1, left, mid - 1)
        fill(res, node.right, row + 1, mid + 1, right)

    # Step 1: Compute the height of the tree
    height = getHeight(root)

    # Step 2: Initialize the 2D list
    width = (2 ** height) - 1
    res = [["" for _ in range(width)] for _ in range(height)]

    # Step 3: Fill the 2D list with tree nodes
    fill(res, root, 0, 0, width - 1)

    return res
```

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Calculate the Height**:
   - The `getHeight` function computes the height of the tree by recursively finding the maximum height between the left and right subtrees and adding 1 for the current node.

2. **Initialize the 2D List**:
   - The height (`height`) is used to determine the number of rows.
   - The width of the 2D list is calculated as `2^height - 1`.
   - The 2D list `res` is initialized with `""` in all cells.

3. **Fill the List**:
   - The `fill` function places each node value in the correct position.
   - The middle index between `left` and `right` is where the current node's value should be placed.
   - The function calls itself recursively to place the left and right children.

4. **Return the List**:
   - Finally, return the populated 2D list.

### Time Complexity

- **Height Calculation**: `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree.
- **Filling 2D List**: Each node is placed in the list once, resulting in `O(N)`.
- **Overall Complexity**: The overall time complexity is `O(N)`.

This approach ensures that each node is correctly positioned within the constraints of the specified 2D list format.
