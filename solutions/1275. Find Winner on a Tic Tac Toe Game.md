title:  Find Winner on a Tic Tac Toe Game-out
permalink: /s1275
---

You are given an array `moves` where each element represents a move made by players in a game of Tic Tac Toe on a 3x3 board. The moves array contains elements in the form `[row, col]`:

- There are two players: Player A and Player B. Player A always plays first.
- Player A and B take turns making moves.
- The board initially is empty.
- The winner is the first player who places three of their marks ('A' or 'B') in a row, column, or diagonal.
- If all cells of the board are filled and no player has won, the game is declared a draw.
- If there are still moves to be played, return "Pending".

The output should be "A" if Player A wins, "B" if Player B wins, "Draw" if no one wins and all cells are filled, and "Pending" if the game is still ongoing.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can a move be duplicated in the input array?
   - No, each move in the input array is unique and valid.

2. Is the input always a valid sequence of moves for a Tic Tac Toe game?
   - Yes, the input array always represents a valid sequence of moves in a Tic Tac Toe game.

3. Should we consider the order of the moves to determine the correct player making each move?
   - Yes, Player A goes first and players alternate turns.

### Code

```python
def tictactoe(moves):
    # Initialize the board as a 3x3 grid
    board = [["" for _ in range(3)] for _ in range(3)]
    
    # Fill the board based on the moves
    for i, (r, c) in enumerate(moves):
        if i % 2 == 0:  # Player A's move
            board[r][c] = 'A'
        else:  # Player B's move
            board[r][c] = 'B'
    
    # Function to check for a winning condition
    def check_winner(player):
        # Check rows, columns, and both diagonals
        for row in board:
            if all(cell == player for cell in row):
                return True
        for col in range(3):
            if all(board[row][col] == player for row in range(3)):
                return True
        if all(board[i][i] == player for i in range(3)):
            return True
        if all(board[i][2 - i] == player for i in range(3)):
            return True
        return False
    
    # Check if A or B has won
    if check_winner('A'):
        return "A"
    if check_winner('B'):
        return "B"
    
    # If no one has won, check if the board is full
    if len(moves) == 9:
        return "Draw"
    
    # If there are remaining moves, return pending
    return "Pending"
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialize the Board**:
   - Create a 3x3 board initialized with empty strings where each cell represents a possible move.

2. **Simulate the Moves**:
   - Iterate over the moves and mark the board using 'A' for Player A and 'B' for Player B based on the move index.

3. **Check for Win Condition**:
   - Implement a helper function `check_winner` to determine if a player has three marks in any row, column, or diagonal.
   
4. **Determine the Result**:
   - If Player A wins, return "A".
   - If Player B wins, return "B".
   - If all moves are exhausted and no winner is found, return "Draw".
   - If there are still potential moves left, return "Pending".

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: Creating the board takes O(1), as it's a fixed 3x3 grid.
- **Simulate Moves**: Processing each move is O(1), and for N moves, it is O(N).
- **Check Winner**: Checking rows, columns, and diagonals involves constant-time checks, as the board size is fixed at 3x3, leading to O(1) operations.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \( O(N) \), where \( N \) is the number of moves.
