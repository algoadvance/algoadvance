title:  Count Number of Bad Pairs-out
permalink: /s2364
---

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. A pair `(i, j)` is called a **bad pair** if:

- `i < j`, and
- `j - i != nums[j] - nums[i]`

Return the total number of bad pairs in the array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of values for array elements?**
   - The values are arbitrary within the bounds of standard integer ranges.
  
2. **What is the size range of the array `nums`?**
   - The size of the array can be as large as 10^5 elements.

3. **Should we consider time and space complexity trade-offs?**
   - Yes, given the potentially large array size, an efficient solution is preferred.


### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can utilize a combination of mathematical reasoning and hash maps to count the bad pairs.

1. **Transform the condition**: 
   - The condition `j - i != nums[j] - nums[i]` can be rearranged. If we define a new list `diff[]` where `diff[i] = nums[i] - i`, then a pair `(i, j)` is considered bad if `diff[i] != diff[j]`.

2. **Count Pairs Efficiently**:
   - We can use a hash map to keep track of the frequency of each value in the `diff` array as we iterate through `nums`.
   - For each element `nums[j]`, calculate `diff[j] = nums[j] - j`.
   - Check how many previous indices `i` have the same `diff` value. All such `i < j` pairs are **not bad pairs**.
   - Calculate the total number of pairs `(i, j)` and subtract the count of good pairs to get the number of bad pairs.

3. **Counting Good Pairs**:
   - For each index `j`, the number of good pairs up to that point can be found using the hash map.

Here is the step-by-step implementation:

### Code

```python
def count_bad_pairs(nums):
    from collections import defaultdict

    diff_counts = defaultdict(int)
    good_pairs = 0
    total_pairs = 0
    n = len(nums)
    
    for i, num in enumerate(nums):
        diff = num - i
        
        # Number of good pairs encountered so far with the same 'diff' value.
        good_pairs += diff_counts[diff]
        
        # Count this index as part of the total processed pairs so far.
        total_pairs += i
        
        # Update frequency of the current 'diff' value.
        diff_counts[diff] += 1

    # Bad pairs are total pairs minus good pairs.
    bad_pairs = total_pairs - good_pairs
    return bad_pairs

# Example Usage:
nums = [4, 1, 3, 3]
print(count_bad_pairs(nums))  # Output: 5
```

### Time Complexity

The solution operates in O(n) time complexity:

- We traverse through the list once to calculate the `diff` values and update the hash map, making a single pass over `nums` which takes O(n).
- Hash map operations for insertion and lookup are average case O(1).

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n), making this approach efficient for large input sizes.
