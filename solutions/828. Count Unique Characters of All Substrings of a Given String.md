title:  Count Unique Characters of All Substrings of a Given String-out
permalink: /s828
---

The task is to count the unique characters of all the substrings of a given string. Specifically, given a string `s`, you need to return the sum of the count of unique characters of every substring of `s`.

For example:
- Given `s = "ABC"`, the substrings are `"A"`, `"B"`, `"C"`, `"AB"`, `"BC"`, and `"ABC"`.
- The unique characters in each substring: `1 (A)`, `1 (B)`, `1 (C)`, `2 (AB)`, `2 (BC)`, `3 (ABC)`.
- The total is `1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 10`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:** Can the input string contain special characters?
2. **Length of the String:** What is the maximum length of the input string?
3. **Output Data Type:** Is the output required to be an integer?

### Strategy

1. **Concept:** For each character in the string, count how many substrings include the character as a unique character.
2. **Contribution Calculation:** The trick is to efficiently calculate the contribution of each character to the substring it belongs to by counting the number of substrings where it acts uniquely.
3. **Previous and Next Occurrences:** Create two arrays `prev` and `next` to store the previous and next occurrences of each character.

### Detailed Steps

1. Initialize arrays to store the previous and next occurrences.
2. Traverse the string to fill these arrays.
3. Calculate the contribution of each character: 
   - Contribution of `s[i]` = `(i - prev[i]) * (next[i] - i)`.

```python
def uniqueLetterString(s: str) -> int:
    n = len(s)
    
    # Initialize arrays to store the previous and next occurrences
    prev = [-1] * n
    next = [n] * n
    
    # Dictionary to store the last seen index of each character for 'prev'
    last_seen = {}
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] in last_seen:
            prev[i] = last_seen[s[i]]
        last_seen[s[i] = i
    
    # Dictionary to store the next seen index of each character for 'next'
    last_seen.clear()
    for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
        if s[i] in last_seen:
            next[i] = last_seen[s[i]]
        last_seen[s[i]] = i
    
    # Calculate the total contribution of each character being unique
    result = 0
    for i in range(n):
        result += (i - prev[i]) * (next[i] - i)
    
    return result
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The solution involves traversing the string a fixed number of times, resulting in a linear time complexity of O(n), where `n` is the length of the string.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(1) for the dictionaries and O(n) for the array storage.

This approach reduces the amount of redundant calculations by directly calculating the contribution of each character in a more efficient manner.
