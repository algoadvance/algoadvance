title:  Word Ladder II-out
permalink: /s126
---

You are given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary's word list. Find all the shortest transformation sequences from `beginWord` to `endWord`, such that:

1. Only one letter can be changed at a time.
2. Each transformed word must exist in the word list.

Return the transformation sequences as a list of lists of strings.

### Example:

Input:
```
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
```

Output:
```
[
  ["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],
  ["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]
]
```

Note:

- Return `[]` if there is no such transformation sequence.
- All words have the same length.
- All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
- You may assume no duplicates in the word list.
- You may assume `beginWord` and `endWord` are non-empty and are not the same.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the length of the words or the size of the word list?**
   No explicit constraints mentioned, but typically we should assume a reasonable size.
2. **Can `beginWord` or `endWord` be missing from the word list?**
   `endWord` should be in the word list, regardless of `beginWord`.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we use a combination of Breadth-First Search (BFS) and Backtracking:

1. **BFS for Shortest Path:** We will use BFS to explore all possible paths from the `beginWord`. We stop once we reach `endWord` ensuring the shortest path.
2. **Graph Construction:** Within BFS, we will construct a graph using predecessors. This is efficient for reconstructing paths in the shortest path length.
3. **Backtracking to Find All Paths:** From the constructed graph, use backtracking to trace all paths from `endWord` to `beginWord`.

## Code Implementation

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def findLadders(beginWord, endWord, wordList):
    if endWord not in wordList:
        return []

    wordList = set(wordList)
    wordList.add(beginWord)

    # BFS to build the graph
    layer = {}
    layer[beginWord] = [[beginWord]]

    while layer:
        new_layer = defaultdict(list)
        for word in layer:
            if word == endWord:
                return layer[word]
            for i in range(len(word)):
                for c in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz':
                    new_word = word[:i] + c + word[i + 1:]
                    if new_word in wordList:
                        new_layer[new_word] += [j + [new_word] for j in layer[word]]
        wordList -= set(new_layer.keys())
        layer = new_layer

    return []

# Example usage:
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot", "dot", "dog", "lot", "log", "cog"]
print(findLadders(beginWord, endWord, wordList))
```

## Time Complexity

1. Constructing the graph - BFS:
   - Each word transformation can generate `26 * len(word)` possible transformations.
   - BFS will visit each word in the word list at most once.
   - Therefore, time complexity for BFS is \(O(M \times N \times 26)\), where \(M\) is the number of words and \(N\) is the length of each word.

2. Backtracking all paths:
   - In the worst case, each word could potentially generate many paths.
   - This is harder to quantify but practically limited by the branching factor of the words in the graph.

Overall, the BFS part dominates, making the complexity \(O(26 \times M \times N)\) in practice.
