title:  Maximum Strength of K Disjoint Subarrays-out
permalink: /s3077
---

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Your task is to find the maximum possible strength of `k` disjoint subarrays. The strength of a subarray is defined as the product of all its elements.

More formally, you need to select `k` disjoint subarrays from `nums`, which maximizes the sum of their strengths, where the strength of each subarray is the product of its elements.

Return the maximum possible strength of `k` disjoint subarrays.

### Example

```plaintext
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4], k = 2
Output: 14
Explanation: The two subarrays could be [2] (strength = 2) and [3, 4] (strength = 3*4 = 12). Thus, the maximum possible strength is 2 + 12 = 14.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are negative numbers allowed in the `nums` array?**
   - Yes, all integers are allowed.
   
2. **What is the length range of the `nums` array?**
   - The length of `nums` can range from 1 to 10^5.
   
3. **What should be the expected output if `k` is 0?**
   - If `k` is 0, the output should be 0 since no subarrays are chosen.

4. **What should be done if `k` is greater than the number of elements in `nums`?**
   - `k` will always be such that it can be satisfied with disjoint subarrays from `nums`.

## Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Define a 2-dimensional DP array `dp[i][j]` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum strength using the first `i` elements to form `j` subarrays.
   - Initialize:
     - `dp[0][0]` should be 0 because if we take 0 elements to form 0 subarrays, the strength is 0.
     - All other `dp[0][j]` where `j > 0` should be `-inf` because it's impossible to form `j` subarrays with 0 elements.
   - Recurrence relation: For each element `i` and for every subarray count `j`:
     - Either the `i`-th element starts a new subarray or it belongs to the previous subarray.
     - Thus, `dp[i][j]` will be the maximum value between `dp[i-1][j]` (not including `i-th` element) and `dp[m][j-1] + product(nums[m+1] to nums[i])` for all valid `m`.

2. **Greedy (Optimality)**:
   - For subarrays to have maximum strength, consider product of positive numbers and consider minimizing loss due to negative numbers.
   - Carefully manage window sizes to maximize products.

## Code

```python
from itertools import accumulate
from functools import lru_cache

def maxStrengthKDisjointSubarrays(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    if k == 0:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize dp array
    dp = [[-float('inf')] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    dp[0][0] = 0
    
    # Prefix products
    prefix_products = [1] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        prefix_products[i] = prefix_products[i - 1] * nums[i - 1]
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, min(i, k) + 1):
            for m in range(j - 1, i):
                product = prefix_products[i] // prefix_products[m]
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[m][j - 1] + product)
                
    return dp[n][k]

# Example Usage
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
k = 2
print(maxStrengthKDisjointSubarrays(nums, k))  # Output: 14
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The overall time complexity is `O(n^2 * k)` due to the nested loops over the length of `nums` and subarray count `k`.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is `O(n * k)` due to the DP array's storage.

This solution balances complexity with correctness by leveraging dynamic programming to ensure optimal subarray selection.
