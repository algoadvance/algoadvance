title:  Maximum Consecutive Floors Without Special Floors-out
permalink: /s2274
---

You are given two integers `bottom` and `top`, which represent the range of floors in a building. Additionally, you are given a list `special`, which contains the floor numbers that are designated as "special" floors. You need to determine the maximum number of consecutive floors in this range that do not include any special floors.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the `bottom` and `top` inclusive?**
   - Yes, both `bottom` and `top` are inclusive.
   
2. **Can the list `special` contain duplicates or be empty?**
   - The list can be empty, but it is guaranteed that it will not contain duplicates.
   
3. **What is the range of the numbers in the input?**
   - The values for `bottom`, `top`, and elements in `special` are in the range of 1 to 10^9, and the size of the list `special` is up to 10^5.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the `special` list:**
   - Sort the list of special floors to ease the process of finding gaps between consecutive special floors.
   
2. **Calculate the gaps:**
   - Compute the number of floors between each consecutive pair of special floors.
   - Also, calculate gaps from `bottom` to the first special floor, and from the last special floor to `top`.
   
3. **Determine the maximum gap:**
   - Keep track of the maximum number of consecutive non-special floors identified in the previous step.

### Code

```python
def maxConsecutive(bottom: int, top: int, special: List[int]) -> int:
    # Sort the given special floors
    special.sort()
    
    # Initialize maximum gap
    max_gap = 0

    # If there are no special floors, the entire range is free
    if not special:
        return top - bottom + 1
    
    # Check the gap before the first special floor
    max_gap = special[0] - bottom
    
    # Calculate the gaps between each pair of consecutive special floors
    for i in range(1, len(special)):
        current_gap = special[i] - special[i - 1] - 1
        max_gap = max(max_gap, current_gap)
    
    # Check the gap after the last special floor
    max_gap = max(max_gap, top - special[-1])
    
    return max_gap
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of special floors.
- **Iterating through the list:** `O(n)` because we iterate through the list of special floors to calculate the gaps.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.

### Explanation

1. **Sort the special floors** to facilitate the calculation of gaps.
2. **Calculate the initial gap** from the `bottom` to the first special floor.
3. **Iterate through** the sorted special floors to calculate gaps between each consecutive special floor.
4. **Update the maximum gap** if a larger gap is found.
5. **Calculate the last gap** from the last special floor to the `top`.
6. **Return the maximum gap** identified through these steps.
