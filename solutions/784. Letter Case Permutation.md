Given a string `s`, you can transform every letter individually to be lowercase or uppercase to create another string. Return a list of all possible strings we could create. You can return the output in any order.

#### Examples:
1. Input: s = "a1b2"
   Output: ["a1b2", "a1B2", "A1b2", "A1B2"]

2. Input: s = "3z4"
   Output: ["3z4", "3Z4"]

3. Input: s = "12345"
   Output: ["12345"]

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Does the string contain only alphanumeric characters?
   **A**: Yes, the string `s` contains only letters and digits.
   
2. **Q**: Is there a specific order required for the output strings?
   **A**: No, the output strings can be in any order.

3. **Q**: Can the input string be empty?
   **A**: The prompt does not mention it explicitly, but typically for an empty string the output would be a list containing an empty string: `[""]`.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a backtracking approach:
1. Iterate through each character in the string.
2. If the character is a digit, it remains the same.
3. If the character is a letter, explore both possibilities: it being lowercase and uppercase.
4. Use recursion to build permutations for subsequent characters and combine them to form the complete list of permutations.

### Code
```python
def letterCasePermutation(s):
    def backtrack(sub_s, index):
        if index == len(s):
            result.append(sub_s)
            return
            
        if s[index].isdigit():
            backtrack(sub_s + s[index], index + 1)
        else:
            backtrack(sub_s + s[index].lower(), index + 1)
            backtrack(sub_s + s[index].upper(), index + 1)
    
    result = []
    backtrack("", 0)  # Initially start with an empty substring and index 0
    return result

# Example usage:
print(letterCasePermutation("a1b2"))  # ["a1b2", "a1B2", "A1b2", "A1B2"]
print(letterCasePermutation("3z4"))   # ["3z4", "3Z4"]
print(letterCasePermutation("12345")) # ["12345"]
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(2^N) where N is the number of letters in the input string `s`. Each letter can have 2 states (lowercase or uppercase), leading to 2^N combinations. Digits do not contribute to the exponential increase.
- **Space Complexity**: O(2^N) to store the result list as we may generate up to 2^N permutations. Additionally, the recursion call stack will use O(N) space.
