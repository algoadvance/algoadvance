title:  Smallest String With Swaps-out
permalink: /s1202

## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and an array of pairs of indices in `s`, you are allowed to swap the characters at any pair of indices. You need to return the lexicographically smallest string that can be formed by applying those swaps in the given pairs any number of times.

### Example:
1. Input: `s = "dcab", pairs = [[0,3],[1,2]]`
   Output: `"bacd"`
   
2. Input: `s = "dcab", pairs = [[0,3],[1,2],[0,2]]`
   Output: `"abcd"`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the input string `s` always non-empty?**
   - Yes.
2. **Can pairs contain duplicate entries?**
   - Generally, no. However, if they do, they would still represent valid swaps and should not affect the answer.
3. **Is the input string and pairs array always valid and within acceptable constraints?**
   - Yes, constraints are typically consistent with LeetCode problems e.g., `1 <= len(s) <= 10^5`.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to find connected components of indices. Characters in the same connected component can be freely swapped among each other, and hence should be lexicographically arranged to get the smallest possible string.

### Steps:

1. **Union-Find Data Structure:**
   We'll use Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union - DSU) to dynamically connect indices based on the provided pairs.

2. **Identify Connected Components:**
   Using the Union-Find structure, identify all the connected components (sets of indices).

3. **Sort Each Component:**
   For each connected component formed, extract the characters, sort them, and place them back into the string in their respective positions.

4. **Construct Result:**
   Construct the final result using the sorted characters in connected components.

### Code:

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.root = list(range(size))
        self.rank = [1] * size

    def find(self, u):
        if self.root[u] != u:
            self.root[u] = self.find(self.root[u])  # Path compression
        return self.root[u]

    def union(self, u, v):
        root_u = self.find(u)
        root_v = self.find(v)
        if root_u != root_v:
            if self.rank[root_u] > self.rank[root_v]:
                self.root[root_v] = root_u
            elif self.rank[root_u] < self.rank[root_v]:
                self.root[root_u] = root_v
            else:
                self.root[root_v] = root_u
                self.rank[root_u] += 1

def smallestStringWithSwaps(s, pairs):
    n = len(s)
    uf = UnionFind(n)
    
    for u, v in pairs:
        uf.union(u, v)
    
    from collections import defaultdict
    components = defaultdict(list)
    
    for i in range(n):
        root = uf.find(i)
        components[root].append(i)
    
    res = list(s)
    
    for indices in components.values():
        chars = [s[i] for i in indices]
        chars.sort()
        for i, char in zip(sorted(indices), chars):
            res[i] = char
    
    return ''.join(res)

# Here are the example test cases:
print(smallestStringWithSwaps("dcab", [[0, 3], [1, 2]]))  # Output: "bacd"
print(smallestStringWithSwaps("dcab", [[0, 3], [1, 2], [0, 2]]))  # Output: "abcd"
```

## Time Complexity

- **Union-Find Operations:** Each union/find operation is nearly constant time, O(α(N)), where α is the Inverse Ackermann function, which grows very slowly.
- **Sorting Characters in Components:** Sorting each component's characters takes O(N log N) in the worst case where every character belongs to the same component.
- **Overall Time Complexity:** O(N log N) mainly due to the sorting step.

This solution is efficient and works within acceptable limits for typical input sizes.
