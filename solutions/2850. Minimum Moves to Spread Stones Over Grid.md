title:  Minimum Moves to Spread Stones Over Grid-out
permalink: /s2850
---
You are given an `m x n` grid where each cell contains a certain number of stones. You can perform the following operation any number of times:
1. Choose any two cells (r1, c1) and (r2, c2) such that they are either in the same row or the same column.
2. Move one stone from cell (r1, c1) to cell (r2, c2).

In one move, you can only transfer one stone. The goal is to redistribute the stones such that each cell ends up with exactly one stone. You need to determine the minimum number of moves required to achieve this configuration.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can we assume that the grid initially contains more stones than or equal to the number of cells?
2. Are all cells guaranteed to contain at least one stone, or can some cells start with zero stones?

### Example
Given the grid:
```
[[1, 3],
 [2, 0]]
```

You can move 1 stone from (1,0) to (1,1), the grid becomes:
```
[[1, 3],
 [1, 1]]
```

Then move 2 stones from (0,1) to (0,0) and (1,1), so it finally becomes:
```
[[1, 1],
 [1, 1]]
```

So, the minimum number of moves for this grid is 3.

### Strategy
1. Calculate the total number of stones and the total number of cells.
2. Compute the target number of stones each cell should have, which is 1 in this problem since each cell should end up with exactly one stone.
3. Calculate the excess/deficit of stones for each cell.
4. Use that information to compute the minimum number of moves required:
    - Excess stones need to be moved to cells with a deficit.
    - Greedily determine the optimal path to transfer excess stones to deficit cells, ensuring minimal moves (since moves are only valid within the same row or column).

### Code
Here is a Python solution for the described problem:

```python
def minMovesToSpreadStones(grid):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    total_stones = sum(sum(row) for row in grid)
    target = m * n  # Since each cell should end up with 1 stone
    
    if total_stones != target:
        return -1  # Impossible to balance stones

    # Creating excess and deficit arrays
    rows_excess = [0] * m
    cols_excess = [0] * n
    
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if grid[i][j] > 1:
                rows_excess[i] += grid[i][j] - 1
                cols_excess[j] += grid[i][j] - 1
            elif grid[i][j] < 1:
                rows_excess[i] -= 1 - grid[i][j]
                cols_excess[j] -= 1 - grid[i][j]

    moves = 0
    row_moves = 0
    col_moves = 0
    
    # Sum all positive and absolute negative values in rows_excess and cols_excess
    for excess in rows_excess:
        if excess > 0:
            row_moves += excess

    for excess in cols_excess:
        if excess > 0:
            col_moves += excess
            
    # Moves made in rows and columns will overlap, we need to consider only the larger one
    moves = max(row_moves, col_moves)
    
    return moves

# Example usage
grid = [[1, 3],
        [2, 0]]
print(minMovesToSpreadStones(grid))  # Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(m * n) because we need to traverse the entire grid to calculate the total stones and then to compute the excess or deficit.

This approach ensures an efficient way to balance stones across the grid within the minimum number of steps required.
