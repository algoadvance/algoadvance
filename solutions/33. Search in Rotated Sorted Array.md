title:  Search in Rotated Sorted Array-out
permalink: /s33
---
You are given an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with distinct values), and an integer `target`. Suppose `nums` is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand (i.e., `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`). You must search for `target` in `nums` and if you find it, return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the array contain duplicate values?
   - No, the problem specifies that all values in the array are distinct.
2. Is the array always rotated, or could it be a regular sorted array sometimes?
   - The array may or may not be rotated. It could be a regular sorted array.
3. Can the array be empty?
   - Yes, if the array is empty, simply return `-1`.

### Strategy
We can leverage a modified binary search to achieve the desired O(log n) runtime. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the approach:
1. **Initialize pointers**: Start (`low`) at the beginning of the array and end (`high`) at the end of the array.
2. **Find mid-point**: Calculate the mid-point of the current segment.
3. **Check if mid-point is target**: If the mid-point element is the target, return its index.
4. **Determine sorted half**:
    - If the left half is sorted (`nums[low] <= nums[mid]`):
        - Check if the target lies within the left half (`nums[low] <= target < nums[mid]`). If so, move the high pointer to `mid - 1`.
        - Otherwise, move the low pointer to `mid + 1`.
    - If the right half is sorted (`nums[mid] <= nums[high]`):
        - Check if the target lies within the right half (`nums[mid] < target <= nums[high]`). If so, move the low pointer to `mid + 1`.
        - Otherwise, move the high pointer to `mid - 1`.
5. **Repeat**: Continue this until the pointers overlap or the target is found.

### Code
```python
def search(nums, target):
    low, high = 0, nums.length - 1

    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid

        # Left half is sorted
        if nums[low] <= nums[mid]:
            if nums[low] <= target < nums[mid]:
                high = mid - 1
            else:
                low = mid + 1
        # Right half is sorted
        else:
            if nums[mid] < target <= nums[high]:
                low = mid + 1
            else:
                high = mid - 1

    return -1
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is \( O(\log n) \) because it uses binary search, continuously dividing the search range by half.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is \( O(1) \) because it only uses a constant amount of additional space for the pointers and the mid index.
