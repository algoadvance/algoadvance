title:  Maximum XOR With an Element From Array-out
permalink: /s1707
---
You are given an array `nums` with n elements and a query array `queries` with m elements. For the ith query, you want to find the maximum `xi XOR y` with `y` being any element of `nums` such that `y <= ai`. 

Formally, the ith query is represented as `(xi, ai)` where you need to maximize `xi XOR y` for any `y` in `nums` such that `y <= ai`.

Return an array `answer` where `answer[i]` is the answer to the ith query.

#### Example
```
Input: nums = [0,1,2,3,4], queries = [[3,1],[1,3],[5,6]]
Output: [3, 3, 7]

Explanation:
1. For query (3,1), the maximum XOR will be 3∧1 = 2, and as `nums` contains 1 and 0 less than or equal to 1, the max XOR result is 3.
2. For query (1,3), the maximum XOR will be 1∧2 = 3, and as `nums` contains 0, 1, 2 and 3, the max XOR result is 3.
3. For query (5,6), the maximum XOR will be 5∧2 = 7, and nums <= 6 are [0,1,2,3,4], thus 7.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are we allowed to sort the input array `nums`?
2. Are the elements of `nums` and `queries` bounded by a certain value?
3. Are there any constraints on the size of `nums` or `queries`?

### Strategy
1. **Sorting and Input Preparation**:
    - Sort `nums` to facilitate checking the condition `y <= ai`.
    - Pair each query with its original index to sort and use later for output.

2. **Trie Data Structure**:
    - Use a Trie to efficiently compute the maximum XOR. Insert elements from `nums` into the Trie.

3. **Process Each Query**:
    - For each query `(xi, ai)`, insert only elements of `nums` that are `<= ai` into the Trie while processing the query.
    - Find the maximum XOR of `xi` with any element in the Trie.

### Solution Code
Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
class TrieNode:
    def __init__(self):
        self.children = {}
        self.value = None

class Trie:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = TrieNode()

    def insert(self, number):
        node = self.root
        for bit in reversed(range(32)):  # Using 32 bits for representation
            bit_val = (number >> bit) & 1
            if bit_val not in node.children:
                node.children[bit_val] = TrieNode()
            node = node.children[bit_val]
        node.value = number

    def get_max_xor(self, number):
        node = self.root
        max_xor = 0
        for bit in reversed(range(32)):
            bit_val = (number >> bit) & 1
            desired_bit = 1 - bit_val
            if desired_bit in node.children:
                max_xor = (max_xor << 1) | 1
                node = node.children[desired_bit]
            else:
                max_xor = (max_xor << 1) | 0
                node = node.children[bit_val]
        return max_xor

def maximizeXor(nums, queries):
    nums.sort()
    indexed_queries = [(xi, ai, idx) for idx, (xi, ai) in enumerate(queries)]
    indexed_queries.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    answer = [0] * len(queries)
    trie = Trie()
    i = 0
    
    for xi, ai, qi_index in indexed_queries:
        while i < len(nums) and nums[i] <= ai:
            trie.insert(nums[i])
            i += 1
        
        if i == 0:
            answer[qi_index] = -1
        else:
            answer[qi_index] = trie.get_max_xor(xi)
    
    return answer

# Example Usage
nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
queries = [[3, 1], [1, 3], [5, 6]]
print(maximizeXor(nums, queries))  # Output: [3, 3, 7]
```

### Time Complexity
- Sorting `nums` takes O(n log n).
- Sorting `queries` takes O(m log m).
- Inserting in Trie takes O(32) per insertion, with a max of `n` insertions.
- Querying Trie is O(32) for each query.

Combining, the overall time complexity is O(n log n + m log m + 32(n + m)), which simplifies to O((n + m) log (n + m)).
