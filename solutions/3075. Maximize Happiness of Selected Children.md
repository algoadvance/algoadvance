title:  Maximize Happiness of Selected Children-out
permalink: /s3075

You are given an integer array `sweets` where `sweets[i]` represents the number of sweets the i-th child wants. You have to distribute the sweets among the children such that the total number of sweets does not exceed `totalSweets`. The objective is to maximize the number of children who will be totally happy, meaning each of the children selected should get exactly the number of sweets they want.

Implement a function `maximizeHappiness(sweets: List[int], totalSweets: int) -> int` to calculate the maximum number of children who can be made fully happy.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Boundaries:**
   - What are the potential lengths of the `sweets` array?
   - What are the potential values of `totalSweets`?

2. **Sorting:**
   - Can we reorder the `sweets` array or do we need to maintain the initial order?
   
3. **Constraints:**
   - Are there any specific constraints on the values within the `sweets` array?

Assuming:
- `sweets` can be an array of integers with a length up to 1000.
- `totalSweets` can be an integer up to 10^5.

## Strategy

1. **Sorting:**
   - First, understand that to maximize the happiness (maximize the number of children), it makes sense to start by giving sweets to children who want the least number of sweets. This will allow us to potentially make more children happy before exhausting the `totalSweets`.
   
2. **Greedy Approach:**
   - Sort the `sweets` array in ascending order.
   - Initialize a counter `happy_children` to 0.
   - Iterate through the sorted array and allot sweets to each child. If the current child's sweets demand can be met without exceeding the `totalSweets`, increment the counter and decrease `totalSweets` by the number of sweets given to the child.
   - Stop when you can no longer satisfy the next child's sweets demand with the remaining `totalSweets`.

3. **Implementation:**

```python
from typing import List

def maximizeHappiness(sweets: List[int], totalSweets: int) -> int:
    # Sort the array to prioritize children with fewer sweets demand
    sweets.sort()

    happy_children = 0
    
    for sweet in sweets:
        if totalSweets >= sweet:
            totalSweets -= sweet
            happy_children += 1
        else:
            break

    return happy_children
```

## Time Complexity

- Sorting the `sweets` array will take \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `sweets` array.
- Iterating through the array will take \(O(n)\).
- Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is \(O(n \log n)\).

This approach maximizes the number of children that can be made happy within the given constraint of total available sweets.
