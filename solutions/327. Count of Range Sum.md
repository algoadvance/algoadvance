title:  Count of Range Sum-out
permalink: /s327
---

You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `lower` and `upper`. Return the number of range sums that lie in the inclusive range [lower, upper].

Range sum `S(i, j)` is defined as the sum of the elements in `nums` between indices `i` and `j` (i.e., `nums[i] + nums[i + 1] + ... + nums[j]`).

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the input array be empty?
   - Yes, it can be.
2. Is the range sum [lower, upper] inclusive?
   - Yes.
3. What is the size range of the input array?
   - The size of the input array can be up to `10^5`.

## Strategy

A brute-force approach would involve computing the range sums for all possible subarrays and checking how many of them lie within the specified range [lower, upper]. However, this would result in an O(n^2) time complexity which is not optimal for large input sizes.

Instead, a more efficient approach involves the use of a modified merge sort algorithm to count the range sums in O(n log n) time. The idea is to use the prefix sums of the array and count the valid ranges while merging arrays in the merge sort process:

1. **Prefix Sum Array:** Calculate the prefix sum array where `prefix_sum[i]` is the sum of elements from the start of the array up to index `i`.
2. **Merge Sort with Counting:** Use a modified merge sort on the prefix sums. During the merge step, count the number of range sums that lie in [lower, upper].

## Code

Here is the implementation of the above strategy:

```python
def countRangeSum(nums, lower, upper):
    # Helper function to perform the merge sort and count range sums
    def merge_sort_and_count(start, end):
        if end - start <= 1: 
            return 0
        mid = (start + end) // 2
        count = merge_sort_and_count(start, mid) + merge_sort_and_count(mid, end)
        j = k = t = mid
        temp = []
        for i in range(start, mid):
            while k < end and prefix_sums[k] - prefix_sums[i] < lower:
                k += 1
            while j < end and prefix_sums[j] - prefix_sums[i] <= upper:
                j += 1
            count += j - k
            while t < end and prefix_sums[t] < prefix_sums[i]:
                temp.append(prefix_sums[t])
                t += 1
            temp.append(prefix_sums[i])
        prefix_sums[start:start+len(temp)] = temp
        return count

    prefix_sums = [0]
    for num in nums:
        prefix_sums.append(prefix_sums[-1] + num)
    return merge_sort_and_count(0, len(prefix_sums))


# Example usage:
nums = [-2, 5, -1]
lower = -2
upper = 2
print(countRangeSum(nums, lower, upper))  # Output: 3
```

## Explanation

1. **Prefix Sums Calculation:** A prefix sum array `prefix_sums` is constructed. The element at index `i` in this array represents the sum of the elements from `nums[0]` to `nums[i-1]`.
2. **Merge Sort with Counting:** 
    - The `merge_sort_and_count` function performs the merge sort on the `prefix_sums`.
    - It counts the number of valid range sums during the merge process by iterating over the possible prefix sums pairs and checking if their differences fit in the range [lower, upper].
3. **Result Return:** The function returns the total count of valid range sums.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(n log n) due to the divide and conquer method used in the merge sort. This is efficient enough for the given constraints of the problem.
