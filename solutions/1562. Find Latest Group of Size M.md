title:  Find Latest Group of Size M-out
permalink: /s1562

You are given an array `arr` that represents the position where a person puts a ball in a lawn with `n` positions. The `i-th` position in `arr` indicates the position where the ball is placed in the `i-th` step. Initially, all positions are empty. You need to find the latest step at which there exists a group of exactly `m` consecutive balls. If no such group exists, return `-1`.

**Example:**
- Input: `arr = [3,5,1,2,4]`, `m = 1`
- Output: `4`

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `arr.length == n`
- `1 <= arr[i] <= n`
- All integers in `arr` are distinct.
- `1 <= m <= n`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Should I be considering the array to start from index `0` or `1`?
   - The problem typically assumes positions start from `1` given the context.
2. What should be returned if no sequence of size `m` is ever formed?
   - The return should be `-1`.

## Strategy
1. Use a list to represent the lawn, where each position can be either empty (`0`) or filled (`1`).
2. Maintain two dictionaries to keep track of the lengths of contiguous blocks of `1s` and their frequency.
3. Process each position in `arr` one at a time:
   a. For each new ball position, check its neighboring positions to update the lengths of contiguous blocks.
   b. Update the dictionaries with the new lengths.
   c. After each step, check if any block of length `m` exists.
4. Return the latest step at which a block of length `m` exists or `-1` if no such block is ever found.

## Code
```python
def findLatestStep(arr, m):
    if m == len(arr):  # special case
        return m
    
    length_count = {}
    groups = [0] * (len(arr) + 2)  # using a list to track groups

    result = -1

    for i, pos in enumerate(arr):
        left = groups[pos - 1]
        right = groups[pos + 1]
        current_length = left + right + 1

        groups[pos - left] = current_length
        groups[pos + right] = current_length

        length_count[left] = length_count.get(left, 0) - 1
        length_count[right] = length_count.get(right, 0) - 1
        length_count[current_length] = length_count.get(current_length, 0) + 1

        if length_count.get(m, 0) > 0:
            result = i + 1
    
    return result
```

This code implements a solution that processes the positions using a list to keep track of the segments of consecutive `1s` and dictionaries to keep track of segment lengths and their frequencies.

## Time Complexity
- Each position is processed in constant time O(1) due to efficient list and dictionary operations.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n), where `n` is the size of the input array `arr`.

This efficient approach ensures that the solution is suitable for the constraint of up to `10^5` positions.
