title:  Insert Delete GetRandom O(1) - Duplicates allowed-out
permalink: /s381
---

Design a data structure that supports all following operations in average **O(1)** time complexity:

1. **insert(val)**: Inserts an item `val` to the collection.
2. **remove(val)**: Removes an item `val` from the collection, if present.
3. **getRandom()**: Returns a random element from the current collection of elements. The probability of each element being returned is linearly related to the number of the same value present in the collection.

**Note**: You must allow duplicate elements.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Are there constraints on the values that can be inserted (e.g., size of integers)?**
   - **A: No specific constraints are mentioned, so assume general integer values.**

2. **Q: Are there constraints on the number of elements the data structure needs to handle?**
   - **A: No specific size constraints are mentioned, but the operations need to remain O(1) on average regardless of number of elements.**

3. **Q: Can we assume the `getRandom` function should pick a value uniformly at random from all values added so far?**
   - **A: Yes, the probability of each element being returned is linearly related to the number of times it has been added, so `getRandom` should return any one of the existing values in the collection with equal probability based on their occurrences.**

### Strategy

To meet the requirements of supporting operations in O(1) average time, we can use:
1. A list to store elements.
2. A dictionary that maps each value to a set of indices where the value is located in the list.

**Insert Operation**: 
- Append the value to the end of the list.
- Update the dictionary with the index of the newly inserted value.

**Remove Operation**: 
- Locate an index of the value to be removed using the dictionary.
- Swap the value with the last element in the list.
- Remove the value from the list.
- Update the dictionary to reflect the new index of the swapped element and remove the old index.

**GetRandom Operation**: 
- Randomly pick an index from the list and return the element at that index.

### Code

```python
import random
import collections

class RandomizedCollection:

    def __init__(self):
        self.elements = []
        self.indices = collections.defaultdict(set)

    def insert(self, val: int) -> bool:
        self.elements.append(val)
        self.indices[val].add(len(self.elements) - 1)
        return len(self.indices[val]) == 1

    def remove(self, val: int) -> bool:
        if not self.indices[val]:
            return False
        remove_index = self.indices[val].pop()
        last_element = self.elements[-1]
        self.elements[remove_index] = last_element
        
        if self.indices[last_element]:
            self.indices[last_element].add(remove_index)
            self.indices[last_element].discard(len(self.elements) - 1)
        
        self.elements.pop()
        return True

    def getRandom(self) -> int:
        return random.choice(self.elements)
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Insert Operation**: O(1) on average.
2. **Remove Operation**: O(1) on average.
3. **GetRandom Operation**: O(1).

### Explanation

- **Dictionary (`indices`)**: Helps to locate and update indices of values in O(1).
- **List (`elements`)**: Allows for efficient appending and swapping of elements.

The provided implementation ensures that all operations required by the problem are executed in average O(1) time complexity.
