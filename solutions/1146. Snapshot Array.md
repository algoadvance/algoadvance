**1146. Snapshot Array**

Implement a `SnapshotArray` that supports the following functionalities:

1. `SnapshotArray(int length)`: Initializes an array-like data structure with the given length. Initially, each element equals 0.
2. `void set(index, val)`: Sets the element at the given index to be equal to val.
3. `int snap()`: Takes a snapshot of the array and returns the snap_id: the total number of times `snap()` has been called minus 1.
4. `int get(index, snap_id)`: Returns the value at the given index, at the time we took the snapshot with the given snap_id.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of possible values for `length`, `index`, and `val`?**
   - The constraints will typically be detailed in the problem description on LeetCode, but they are generally within the limits of typical array and integer ranges.

2. **How frequently are `snap()`, `set()`, and `get()` functions called?**
   - Understanding the frequency can help optimize the solution. For this problem, we assume a mixed usage pattern.

3. **Can we assume that `get()` will only be called with a valid `snap_id`?**
   - Yes, usually it is guaranteed that `snap_id` will be valid based on the constraints provided.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a list where each element keeps a dictionary, with keys as `snap_id` and values as the latest value of the element at the respective snapshot.

2. **Set Operation:**
   - Update the current value of the specified index.

3. **Snap Operation:**
   - Store the current values of all indices and return the current `snap_id`, then increment the `snap_id` for the next snapshot.

4. **Get Operation:**
   - Retrieve the value from the dictionary that is closest to and less than or equal to the given `snap_id`.

The main advantage of this approach is to minimize space usage by storing only changes rather than entire snapshots.

### Code

```python
class SnapshotArray:

    def __init__(self, length: int):
        self.current_array = [0] * length
        self.snapshots = [{} for _ in range(length)]
        self.snap_id = 0

    def set(self, index: int, val: int) -> None:
        self.current_array[index] = val

    def snap(self) -> int:
        for i in range(len(self.current_array)):
            self.snapshots[i][self.snap_id] = self.current_array[i]
        self.snap_id += 1
        return self.snap_id - 1

    def get(self, index: int, snap_id: int) -> int:
        if snap_id in self.snapshots[index]:
            return self.snapshots[index][snap_id]
        else:
            # Find the latest snapshot before or equal to the requested snap_id
            for sid in range(snap_id, -1, -1):
                if sid in self.snapshots[index]:
                    return self.snapshots[index][sid]
        return 0  # Default value if not found

# Example usage:
# snapshotArr = SnapshotArray(3);
# snapshotArr.set(0, 5);
# snapshotArr.snap();
# snapshotArr.set(0, 6);
# print(snapshotArr.get(0, 0));
```


### Time Complexity

1. **Initialization:** `O(N)` where `N` is the length of the array.
2. **Set operation:** `O(1)` since it is a direct value assignment.
3. **Snap operation:** `O(N)` where `N` is the length of the array, as it requires iterating through the array to store the current state.
4. **Get operation:** In the worst case (if we need to backtrack through snap_ids), this could be `O(S)`, where `S` is the number of snapshots. If the snap_ids are evenly distributed, it can be optimized further.

Overall, this strategy efficiently handles the snapshot functionality with a balanced approach between space complexity (by storing only changes) and time complexity for operations.
