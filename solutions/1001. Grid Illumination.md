title:  Grid Illumination-out
permalink: /s1001
---
You are given an `n x n` grid, each cell in the grid has a unique coordinate `(r, c)`, where `0 <= r, c < n`. Initially, some cells are illuminated by lamps. You are asked to perform a series of queries. During each query, you are to determine if the cell `(r, c)` is illuminated, and, after that, turn off the lamps in cells adjacent (at most distance 1) to `(r, c)`; this includes turning off the lamp at `(r, c)` itself.

A cell `(r, c)` is illuminated if there is at least one lamp in the same row, column, or diagonal as `(r, c)`.

Write a function to perform these queries. 

## Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 10^9`
- `0 <= lamps.length <= 20000`
- `0 <= queries.length <= 20000`
- `queries[i].length == 2`
- `lamps[i].length == 2`

### Input
- `n`: an integer representing the dimension of the grid.
- `lamps`: a list of lamp positions where each position is a list of two integers `[r, c]`.
- `queries`: a list of query positions where each position is a list of two integers `[r, c]`.

### Output
- Return a list of integers representing the results of the queries. `1` if the cell is illuminated, `0` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can multiple lamps be placed at the same position in the grid?
2. When a lamp is turned off due to a query, does it affect subsequent queries?
3. Can we assume that there will always be a valid query/lamp input range?

### Strategy
1. Use dictionaries to keep track of the number of lamps affecting a given row, column, and both diagonals.
2. Use a set to store the positions of currently active lamps.
3. For each query, check if the queried cell is illuminated by examining the dictionaries.
4. Turn off the lamp at the queried cell and the adjacent cells by decrementing counts in the dictionaries and updating the set.

### Code
Here's the Python solution:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def gridIllumination(n, lamps, queries):
    def add_lamp(r, c):
        rows[r] += 1
        cols[c] += 1
        diag1[r - c] += 1
        diag2[r + c] += 1
        lamps_set.add((r, c))
    
    def remove_lamp(r, c):
        if (r, c) in lamps_set:
            rows[r] -= 1
            cols[c] -= 1
            diag1[r - c] -= 1
            diag2[r + c] -= 1
            lamps_set.remove((r, c))

    rows = defaultdict(int)
    cols = defaultdict(int)
    diag1 = defaultdict(int)
    diag2 = defaultdict(int)
    lamps_set = set()

    for lamp in lamps:
        add_lamp(lamp[0], lamp[1])

    res = []
    directions = [(-1, -1), (-1, 0), (-1, 1), (0, -1), (0, 0), (0, 1), (1, -1), (1, 0), (1, 1)]

    for query in queries:
        r, c = query
        if rows[r] > 0 or cols[c] > 0 or diag1[r - c] > 0 or diag2[r + c] > 0:
            res.append(1)
        else:
            res.append(0)
        
        for dr, dc in directions:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if 0 <= nr < n and 0 <= nc < n:
                remove_lamp(nr, nc)
    
    return res

# Example Usage
n = 5
lamps = [[0, 0], [4, 4]]
queries = [[1, 1], [1, 0]]
print(gridIllumination(n, lamps, queries))  # Expected output: [1, 0]
```

### Time Complexity
- Adding all lamps' positions to the dictionaries: O(lamps.length)
- For each query, checking illumination and updating the dictionaries: O(queries.length * 9)
- Overall complexity: O(lamps.length + queries.length * 9)

Given the constraints specified, this approach ensures we remain efficient and within reasonable computation limits for the input sizes.
