title:  Self Dividing Numbers-out
permalink: /s728
---
A self-dividing number is a number that is divisible by every digit it contains.

- For example, 128 is a self-dividing number because 128 % 1 == 0, 128 % 2 == 0, and 128 % 8 == 0.
- Also, a self-dividing number does not contain any 0 digits.

Given a lower and upper number bound, output a list of every possible self-dividing number, including the bounds if possible.

You can assume that the input boundaries are always valid.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range Inclusion:** Should the range include the lower and upper bounds?
   - Yes, include the lower and upper bounds.
2. **Zero Handling:** How to handle numbers with zero in their digits?
   - Numbers containing any zero digit are not self-dividing numbers.
3. **Output Order:** Should the output list be in any specific order?
   - The output list should be in ascending order since we will be iterating through the range in increasing order.

### Strategy
1. **Helper Function:** Create a helper function `is_self_dividing` to check if a number is self-dividing.
    - Convert the number to its digit representation.
    - If any digit is `0` or the number is not divisible by any of its digits, return `False`.
    - Otherwise, return `True`.
2. **Iterate Range:** Iterate through the given range (inclusive) and collect all numbers that satisfy the self-dividing property using the helper function.
3. **Collect Results:** Return the list of self-dividing numbers.

### Code
Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def is_self_dividing(number):
    original = number
    while number > 0:
        digit = number % 10
        if digit == 0 or original % digit != 0:
            return False
        number //= 10
    return True

def selfDividingNumbers(left, right):
    result = []
    for num in range(left, right + 1):
        if is_self_dividing(num):
            result.append(num)
    return result

# Test the function
left = 1
right = 22
print(selfDividingNumbers(left, right))
```

### Time Complexity
- **Helper Function:** For each number, the `is_self_dividing` function checks each digit, resulting in O(d) where d is the number of digits.
- **Overall Iteration:** The `selfDividingNumbers` function iterates through all numbers in the range [left, right], calling the helper function.
    - Let n be the count of numbers in the range, and assuming the average number of digits is log10(right), the overall time complexity becomes O(n * log10(right)).

In summary:
- Creating a helper function to check the self-dividing condition.
- Iterating through the range and gathering all self-dividing numbers.
- Complexity is O(n * log10(right)) which is efficient for typical input ranges allowed in common problems.
