title:  Erect the Fence-out
permalink: /s587
---

You are given an array `trees` where `trees[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the location of a tree in the 2D garden. You are asked to fence the entire garden using the minimum length of rope as it is expensive. The fence should form a convex polygon which encloses all the trees.

Return the coordinates of the trees that are on the perimeter of the fence (in clockwise order). 

You may assume all the given points are unique. The order of the output is not required to be unique.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can we have the points returned in any order as long as they form the perimeter of the fence?
   - Yes, the order doesn't matter as long as they are on the perimeter.

2. Is it guaranteed that there will be at least three points in the input?
   - Yes, based on typical problem constraints for this type of problem.

3. Are there any constraints on the values of the coordinates?
   - Typically, the coordinates would fit within reasonable bounds for calculation.

### Strategy

The problem can be approached using the **Convex Hull** algorithms. The two main algorithms for finding a convex hull are Graham's scan and Jarvis's march (often called the Gift wrapping algorithm). Given the constraints and typical coding problems, we will use the **Graham scan algorithm** for its efficiency:

Steps:
1. Find the point with the lowest y-coordinate, called `start`. If there are ties, choose the point with the lowest x-coordinate.
2. Sort the points by the polar angle they make with the `start` point. If multiple points have the same angle, the one that is farther from the `start` should come first.
3. Iterate through the sorted points and use a stack to build the hull. For each point, ensure that it makes a left turn with the preceding points.

### Code

Here is the Python implementation:

```python
import math

def outerTrees(trees):
    # Find the bottom-most point (or the left-most point in case of a tie)
    start = min(trees, key=lambda p: (p[1], p[0]))
    
    # Function to calculate the polar angle
    def polar_angle(p):
        return math.atan2(p[1] - start[1], p[0] - start[0])
    
    def distance(p):
        return (p[0] - start[0]) ** 2 + (p[1] - start[1]) ** 2
    
    # Sort points by polar angle with the start point
    sorted_points = sorted(trees, key=lambda p: (polar_angle(p), -distance(p)))
    
    # Graham scan algorithm
    hull = []
    
    def cross_product(o, a, b):
        return (a[0] - o[0]) * (b[1] - o[1]) - (a[1] - o[1]) * (b[0] - o[0])
    
    for point in sorted_points:
        # While the turn is not counter-clockwise, pop the last point from hull
        while len(hull) >= 2 and cross_product(hull[-2], hull[-1], point) < 0:
            hull.pop()
        hull.append(point)
    
    return list(hull)

# Example usage:
trees = [[1,1],[2,2],[2,0],[2,4],[3,3],[4,2]]
print(outerTrees(trees))
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is mainly determined by the sorting step and the linear scan:

- Sorting the points takes \(O(N \log N)\), where \(N\) is the number of points.
- The scan through the sorted points is \(O(N)\).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(N \log N)\).
