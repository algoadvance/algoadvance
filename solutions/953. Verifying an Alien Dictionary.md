title:  Verifying an Alien Dictionary-out
permalink: /s953
---

In an alien language, surprisingly, they also use English lowercase letters, but possibly in a different order. The order of the alphabet is some permutation of lowercase letters.

Given a sequence of words written in the alien language and the order of the alphabet, return `true` if and only if the given words are sorted lexicographically in this alien language.

#### Example:

**Example 1:**

- Input: words = ["hello","leetcode"], order = "hlabcdefgijkmnopqrstuvwxyz"
- Output: true
- Explanation: As 'h' comes before 'l' in this language, the sequence is sorted.

**Example 2:**

- Input: words = ["word","world","row"], order = "worldabcefghijkmnpqstuvxyz"
- Output: false
- Explanation: As 'd' comes after 'l' in this language, the sequence is not sorted.

**Example 3:**

- Input: words = ["apple","app"], order = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
- Output: false
- Explanation: The first three characters "app" match, and the second string is shorter (in size). According to lexicographical order "apple" should come after "app".

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= words.length <= 100`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 20`
- `order.length == 26`
- All characters in `words[i]` and `order` are English lowercase letters.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Will the input words always contain only lowercase English letters?**
   - Yes, the problem constraints ensure that only lowercase English letters are used in the words and the order.

2. **Will there be any duplicate words or characters in the words list?**
   - There can be duplicate words in the list, but it does not affect the lexicographical ordering check.

### Strategy

1. **Mapping the Order:**
   - Create a dictionary to map each character in the `order` string to its positional index (0 to 25).

2. **Compare Words:**
   - Iterate through each pair of adjacent words and compare them using the alien dictionary order.
   - For each pair of words, compare character by character.
     - If characters are different, use the order dictionary to determine which word should come first.
     - If one word is a prefix of the other, ensure that the shorter word comes first.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Handle cases where words are exactly the same or one is a prefix of the other.

### Code

```python
def isAlienSorted(words, order):
    order_index = {char: i for i, char in enumerate(order)}

    def compare_words(word1, word2):
        for c1, c2 in zip(word1, word2):
            if c1 != c2:
                return order_index[c1] < order_index[c2]
        return len(word1) <= len(word2)

    for i in range(len(words) - 1):
        if not compare_words(words[i], words[i + 1]):
            return False
    return True
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(N * M)**, where:
- **N** is the number of words.
- **M** is the maximum length of a word in the list.

#### Explanation:
- Creating the order index dictionary takes O(26) = O(1) since the length of the alphabet is constant.
- Comparing each pair of words takes O(M).
- We compare N-1 pairs of words in total.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(N * M).
