title:  Remove Nth Node From End of List-out
permalink: /s19
---

Given the head of a linked list, remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

**Example:**
```
Input: head = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], n = 2
Output: [1, 2, 3, 5]
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the list is `sz`.
- `1 <= sz <= 30`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
- `1 <= n <= sz`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is it guaranteed that `n` is always valid, i.e., `1 <= n <= sz`?**
    - Yes, based on the constraints.

2. **Should the function return the new head of the list or just modify the list in place?**
    - The function should return the new head of the list.

3. **Can I assume that the list contains only integers?**
    - Yes, based on the problem statement.

### Code

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def removeNthFromEnd(head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
    # Create a dummy node to handle edge cases more easily
    dummy = ListNode(0, head)
    first = dummy
    second = dummy
    
    # Move first pointer so that there is a gap of n nodes between first and second
    for _ in range(n + 1):
        first = first.next

    # Move both pointers until first reaches the end
    while first is not None:
        first = first.next
        second = second.next
    
    # Remove the nth node from end
    second.next = second.next.next
    
    # Return the new head
    return dummy.next
```

### Strategy

1. **Use a Dummy Node:**
    - Introduce a dummy node that points to the head of the list. This helps in handling edge cases where the head might be removed.
    
2. **Two Pointers Technique:**
    - Utilize two pointers (`first` and `second`).
    - First, advance the `first` pointer by `n + 1` steps from the dummy node. This ensures that the gap between `first` and `second` is `n` nodes.
    - Move both pointers one step at a time until `first` pointer reaches the end.
    - Now, `second` pointer is at the node right before the node to be removed.
    
3. **Remove the Node:**
    - Change the `next` pointer of the `second` node to skip the node to be removed.

4. **Return the New Head:**
    - Return `dummy.next` which points to the updated head of the list.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(L)` where `L` is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the list once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` because we only use a fixed amount of extra space (pointers).

This approach ensures that we efficiently remove the nth node from the end of the list with a single pass through the list.
