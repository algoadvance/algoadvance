title:  Find And Replace in String-out
permalink: /s833
---
You are given a string `s` and an array of `indexes`, an array of `sources`, and an array of `targets`, all of the same length. The `indexes` array contains the positions in `s` where the substrings in `sources` are to be found. You must check if the substring in `s` starting from the position given in `indexes` matches the `sources` string. If it matches, you should replace that substring in `s` with the corresponding `targets` string. If it doesn't match, do nothing.

Finally, return the modified string after all replacements are done.

**Example:**
```
Input: s = "abcd", indexes = [0, 2], sources = ["a", "cd"], targets = ["eee", "ffff"]
Output: "eeebffff"
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `indexes.length == sources.length == targets.length <= 100`
- `0 <= indexes[i] < s.length`
- `sources[i]` and `targets[i]` consist of only lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the indices overlap in such a way that they would affect each other's replacements?
   - Typically, replacements should be distinct, but we will consider non-overlapping replacements for simplicity until explicitly stated otherwise.
2. Should we continue processing if a source string at a given index does not match?
   - Yes, if the source does not match, we do not replace and continue with others.

## Strategy
1. Create a list to hold the parts of the new string.
2. Iterate through the given indexes, sources, and targets sorted by the indexes.
   - For each pair (index, source), if the substring of `s` starting at `index` matches `source`, it will be replaced by the corresponding target.
3. Construct the final string by concatenating parts of `s` with the appropriate replacements.

## Code

```python
def findReplaceString(s, indexes, sources, targets):
    # Create a list to store changes and iterate in sorted order of indexes
    changes = sorted(zip(indexes, sources, targets))

    # Initialize the final output and the last index processed
    result = []
    last_idx = 0

    # Process each change
    for index, source, target in changes:
        # Append the unmodified part of the string
        result.append(s[last_idx:index])
        
        # If the substring matches the source, replace it with the target
        if s[index:index+len(source)] == source:
            result.append(target)
            last_idx = index + len(source)
        else:
            last_idx = index

    # Include any remaining part of the string
    result.append(s[last_idx:])

    # Join the list into a final string and return
    return ''.join(result)

# Test example
s = "abcd"
indexes = [0, 2]
sources = ["a", "cd"]
targets = ["eee", "ffff"]
print(findReplaceString(s, indexes, sources, targets))   # Output: "eeebffff"
```

## Time Complexity
- Sorting the `indexes` array will take \(O(n \log n)\), where `n` is the length of the `indexes` array.
- Constructing the result string will be \(O(m)\), where `m` is the length of the string `s`.
- Overall, the time complexity of this approach is \(O(n \log n + m)\).

This solution efficiently handles the requirements by processing replacements in the correct order while ensuring non-overlapping and correct application of replacements.
