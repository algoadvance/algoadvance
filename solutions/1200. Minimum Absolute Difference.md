title:  Minimum Absolute Difference-out
permalink: /s1200
---

You are given a list of distinct integers `arr` and you want to find all pairs of elements with the minimum absolute difference of any two elements. The output should be a list of pairs sorted in ascending order.

Given a list of `n` distinct integers, find all pairs of elements with the minimum absolute difference.

**Example:**  
Input: `arr = [4, 2, 1, 3]`  
Output: `[[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Duplicates**: Are there any duplicates in the array?
   - No, the problem specifies that the integers are distinct.
2. **Order**: Should the pairs in the output be sorted?
   - Yes, pairs should be sorted in ascending order and also the individual pairs themselves should be in ascending order.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting the array will allow us to easily find the minimum absolute difference by comparing adjacent elements.
2. **Find Minimum Absolute Difference**: Traverse the sorted array to find the minimum absolute difference between any two consecutive elements.
3. **Collect Pairs**: Traverse the sorted array again to collect all pairs of elements that have the minimum absolute difference.
4. **Sorting Pairs**: Since the pairs are formed from a sorted array and the problem specifies sorting, we will naturally get sorted pairs.

### Code

```python
def minimumAbsDifference(arr):
    arr.sort()
    min_diff = float('inf')
    result = []
    
    # Find the minimum absolute difference
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        diff = arr[i] - arr[i-1]
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    
    # Collect all pairs with the minimum absolute difference
    for i in range(1, len(arr)):
        if arr[i] - arr[i-1] == min_diff:
            result.append([arr[i-1], arr[i]])
    
    return result

# Example usage:
arr = [4, 2, 1, 3]
print(minimumAbsDifference(arr))  # Output: [[1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: The time complexity of sorting the array is \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Finding Minimum Difference**: Traversing the sorted array to find the minimum difference takes \(O(n)\).
- **Collecting Pairs**: Traversing the array again to collect pairs also takes \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is 
\[ O(n \log n) + O(n) + O(n) = O(n \log n) \]
