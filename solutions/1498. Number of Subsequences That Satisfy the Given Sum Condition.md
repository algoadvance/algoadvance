title:  Number of Subsequences That Satisfy the Given Sum Condition-out
permalink: /s1498
---

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the number of non-empty subsequences of `nums` such that the sum of the minimum and maximum element on it is less or equal to `target`. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of numbers in the input array?** 
   - The constraint typically ensures that the elements in the `nums` are between 1 and 10^6.
2. **What are the constraints on the size of the array `nums`?**
   - The length of `nums` is between 1 and 10^5.
3. **Are there any negative numbers in the array `nums`?**
   - No, all elements are non-negative integers as per typical constraints.
4. **Should the result only include non-empty subsequences?**
   - Yes, the task specifies non-empty subsequences.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Array:** 
   Begin by sorting the array. This helps in efficiently determining the minimum and maximum elements of subsequences.
   
2. **Two-Pointer Technique:** 
   Use two pointers, one starting from the beginning (`left`) and one starting from the end (`right`) of the sorted array. This allows us to explore the possible subsequences with the smallest and largest elements efficiently.

3. **Count Valid Subsequences:** 
   For each `left` pointer position, find the maximum position `right` where the sum of the smallest and largest elements (i.e., `nums[left] + nums[right]`) is less than or equal to `target`. If valid, all subsequences formed by elements in the range `left` to `right` are considered.

4. **Calculate the Number of Subsequences:**
   The number of valid subsequences between `left` and `right` can be determined using the power of two. Specifically, for every difference (`right - left`) there are `2^(right - left)` subsequences.

5. **Modulo Operation:**
   Since the result can be very large, use modulo `10^9 + 7` to keep the number manageable.

### Code

```python
def numSubseq(nums, target):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    nums.sort()
    n = len(nums)
    left, right = 0, n - 1
    result = 0

    # Precompute the powers of 2 up to n, modulo MOD
    power_of_2 = [1]
    for i in range(1, n):
        power_of_2.append((power_of_2[-1] * 2) % MOD)
    
    while left <= right:
        if nums[left] + nums[right] > target:
            right -= 1
        else:
            # The number of subarrays which have the smallest `nums[left]`
            # and can include any subset of elements from `left+1` to `right`
            result += power_of_2[right - left]
            result %= MOD  # Ensure we stay within MOD
            left += 1
    
    return result

# Example usage:
nums = [3, 5, 6, 7]
target = 9
print(numSubseq(nums, target))  # Output should be 4
```

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the array takes `O(n log n)`.
- The two-pointer traversal of the array takes `O(n)`.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`, primarily dominated by the sorting step.

This strategy ensures we can handle the constraints efficiently and gives the correct number of valid subsequences modulo `10^9 + 7`.
