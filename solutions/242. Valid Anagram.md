title:  Valid Anagram-out

Given two strings `s` and `t`, write a function to determine if `t` is an anagram of `s`.

An anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Are the inputs always valid strings?
   - **A**: Yes.
2. **Q**: Is the comparison case-sensitive?
   - **A**: Yes, the comparison is case-sensitive.
3. **Q**: Can the strings contain spaces or special characters?
   - **A**: Yes, they can contain any characters.

### Strategy

To determine if `t` is an anagram of `s`:
1. Both strings must have the same length.
2. Both strings must contain the exact same characters with the same frequencies.

We can implement this using two strategies:

1. **Sorting**: Sort both strings and compare them. If they are identical after sorting, one is an anagram of the other.
2. **Hash Map (Dictionary)**: Use a dictionary to count the frequency of each character in both strings. Then compare the two dictionaries.

The hash map strategy is more efficient because sorting has a time complexity of `O(n log n)`, while using a hash map has a linear time complexity of `O(n)`.

We'll implement the hash map strategy.

### Code

```python
def isAnagram(s: str, t: str) -> bool:
    # Early return if lengths differ
    if len(s) != len(t):
        return False
    
    # Create frequency dictionaries for both strings
    count_s = {}
    count_t = {}
    
    for char in s:
        count_s[char] = count_s.get(char, 0) + 1
    
    for char in t:
        count_t[char] = count_t.get(char, 0) + 1
    
    # Compare frequency dictionaries
    return count_s == count_t
```

### Explanation

1. **Early Return**: If the lengths of `s` and `t` are different, immediately return `False`.
2. **Frequency Dictionaries**: Create dictionaries to count the occurrences of each character in both `s` and `t`.
3. **Comparison**: Compare the two dictionaries. If they are equal, then `t` is an anagram of `s`; otherwise, it is not.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the strings. We iterate over each string once to build the frequency dictionaries and then perform a comparison of the dictionaries, which is also linear in time.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` assuming the character set is fixed (e.g., ASCII or Unicode). The dictionaries will have a space complexity proportional to the number of unique characters in the strings.
