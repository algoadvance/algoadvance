title:  Intersection of Two Arrays-out
permalink: /s349
---

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must be unique, and you may return the result in any order.

### Example

```python
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2]

Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [9,4]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the arrays be empty?**
   - Yes, the arrays can be empty. The intersection of two empty arrays is an empty array.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the values within the arrays?**
   - The arrays contain integers, and we generally need only to concern ourselves with typical integer values dealt with in standard computational tasks.
   
3. **Do we need to preserve the order of elements in the result?**
   - No, the order of elements in the result does not matter according to the problem description.

### Strategy

1. **Convert `nums1` to a Set**: Using a set will automatically handle the uniqueness requirement.
2. **Iterate Through `nums2`**: Check if the current element exists in the set created from `nums1`.
3. **Add to Result Set**: If the element from `nums2` exists in the set from `nums1`, add it to a result set (this ensures uniqueness in results).
4. **Convert Result Set to List**: Since the final result is required to be a list, convert the resultant set to a list.

### Time Complexity

- Converting a list into a set takes \(O(n)\) time where \(n\) is the length of `nums1`.
- Iterating through `nums2` and performing set operations for each element takes \(O(m)\) time where \(m\) is the length of `nums2`.
- Overall time complexity is \(O(n + m)\).

### Python Code

```python
def intersection(nums1, nums2):
    # Convert nums1 to a set
    set1 = set(nums1)
    # Create an empty set for the result
    result_set = set()
    
    # Iterate through nums2 and check for intersections
    for num in nums2:
        if num in set1:
            result_set.add(num)
    
    # Convert the result set to a list and return
    return list(result_set)
```

### Example Execution

```python
nums1 = [4,9,5]
nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
print(intersection(nums1, nums2))  # Output: [9, 4]

nums1 = [1,2,2,1]
nums2 = [2,2]
print(intersection(nums1, nums2))  # Output: [2]
```

This solution effectively and efficiently captures the intersection of two arrays while ensuring that the result contains unique elements.
