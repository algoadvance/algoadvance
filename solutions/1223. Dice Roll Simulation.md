title:  Dice Roll Simulation-out

You have a dice with `faces` faces, and each face has a different number of dots (from 1 to `faces`). Return how many possible distinct sequences of dice rolls of length `n` you can obtain such that there is no consecutive permutation of the same number more than `rollMax[i]` times, where `rollMax[i]` is the maximum number of consecutive times that a given face can be rolled.

Given:
- `faces`: an integer representing the number of faces on the dice.
- `n`: an integer representing the length of the sequence to roll the dice.
- `rollMax`: a list of integers of length `faces`, where `rollMax[i]` is the maximum number of consecutive times that face `(i+1)` can be rolled (rollMax[0] corresponds to face 1, rollMax[1] corresponds to face 2, and so on).

Return the number of distinct sequences modulo 10^9 + 7.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. Can the sequence contain different faces with different `rollMax` at the same time?
   - Yes, the constraints apply to each face separately.
   
2. What is the maximum value for `n` and `faces`?
   - Typically these constraints will be mentioned in the problem prompt. Assume them to be reasonably large but manageable within typical computational limits, n <= 5000 and faces <= 6 in common problem constraints.

3. Are all faces guaranteed to have a non-zero `rollMax`?
   - Yes, `rollMax` is given for each face and each value is assumed to be at least greater than zero.

## Strategy:

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**:
   - Define a DP table `dp[i][j]` where `i` is the length of the sequence and `j` is the face of the dice.
   - Use additional states to keep track of consecutive counts.
   - Transitions will consider extending sequences of length `i-1` with one more roll given the `rollMax` constraints.
   
2. **Modulo Operation**: Since the results can be very large, apply modulo \(10^9 + 7\) at each step.

3. Iterate through lengths from `1` to `n` and calculate the possible sequences adhering to the constraints.

## Code:

```python
def dieSimulator(n: int, faces: int, rollMax: List[int]) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    dp = [[[0]*(15) for _ in range(faces)] for _ in range(n+1)]
    
    for j in range(faces):
        dp[1][j][1] = 1
    
    for i in range(2, n+1):
        for j in range(faces):
            for k in range(faces):
                if j != k:
                    for m in range(1, rollMax[k] + 1):
                        dp[i][j][1] = (dp[i][j][1] + dp[i-1][k][m]) % MOD
                else:
                    for m in range(1, rollMax[k]):
                        dp[i][j][m+1] = (dp[i][j][m+1] + dp[i-1][k][m]) % MOD

    result = 0
    for j in range(faces):
        for m in range(1, rollMax[j] + 1):
            result = (result + dp[n][j][m]) % MOD
            
    return result
```

## Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n * faces^2 * max(rollMax))
  - We iterate through states of length n, faces, and consecutive counts which can go up to `max(rollMax)`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n * faces * max(rollMax))
  - We maintain a DP table that holds the state for each combination of length, face, and consecutive count.

This should solve the problem within the constraints while considering modular arithmetic for large numbers.
