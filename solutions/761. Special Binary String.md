title:  Special Binary String-out
permalink: /s761
---

The problem requires us to reorder the characters of a given binary string such that after concatenation the result is the lexicographically largest string possible and is still a special binary string.

A "special" binary string can be defined recursively as follows:

1. The string is empty, or
2. The string can be written as "1" + special_binary_string + "0", or
3. The string is the concatenation of two or more special binary strings.

### Clarifying Questions

Before proceeding, let's clarify a few things:

1. **Input Constraints**: What is the maximum length of the binary string?
2. **Output Format**: Should the output be a string?
3. **Edge Cases**: How do we handle edge cases such as an empty string or a string with only '0's or '1's (though the latter shouldn't be "special")?

Assuming standard problem constraints as generally provided by Leetcode:
- Input is a binary string where the number of '1's equals the number of '0's.
- The string will only contain '0's and '1's.
- The string length will be up to a reasonable number.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to take advantage of the recursive structure of special binary strings:

1. **Partitioning**: Identify concatenatable special binary substrings.
2. **Optimization**: Sort these special binary substrings in descending lexicographical order.
3. **Recursion**: Apply the same logic recursively to each identified substring.

To break down how to partition the string into special binary substrings:
- We traverse the string, maintaining a balance count where `balance += 1` for '1' and `balance -= 1` for '0'. When `balance == 0`, we have identified a valid special binary substring.

### Code

Here's how you can implement this strategy in Python:

```python
def makeLargestSpecial(s: str) -> str:
    # Helper function to split and sort the special substrings
    def split_special(s):
        count = 0
        i = 0
        specials = []
        start = 0
        for i in range(len(s)):
            if s[i] == '1':
                count += 1
            else:
                count -= 1
            if count == 0:
                # Found a valid special substring
                specials.append('1' + split_special(s[start + 1: i]) + '0')
                start = i + 1
        # Sort in descending lexicographical order
        specials.sort(reverse=True)
        return ''.join(specials)

    return split_special(s)

# Example Usage
print(makeLargestSpecial("11011000"))  # Expected Output: "11100100"
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this approach is O(n log n) where `n` is the length of the string. The reason is:
  - Each substring creation step is O(n).
  - Sorting the substrings within each partition step is O((n/log(n)) * log(n)) which simplifies to O(n log n).
  - The recurrence tree depth, corresponding to each recursive partition, is bounded by O(log n) at maximum due to the binary nature of the problem.

Thus, recursive combination and sorting of substrings contribute mainly to O(n log n).

### Conclusion

In solving this problem, we utilized the recursive property of special binary strings to partition and sort them into the lexicographically largest form. This approach ensures that we satisfy both the problem constraints and optimize for larger inputs effectively.
