title:  Sum of Distances in Tree-out
permalink: /s834
---
You are given an integer `n` representing the number of nodes in a tree, and an array edges where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree.

Return an array `answer` of length `n` where `answer[i]` is the sum of the distances between the i-th node and all other nodes in the tree.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input constraints**:
    - What are the ranges for `n`?
    - Are the node values from 0 to n-1?
    - Is the given input always a tree (i.e., connected and acyclic)?

2. **Output requirements**:
    - Should the result be an array with distances from each node to all other nodes?

With these clarifications, it is confirmed that the input is always a tree, nodes range from 0 to n-1, and `n` can be as large as 30,000. We need to compute the sum of distances for each node efficiently given the constraints.

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we leverage a two-pass Depth-First Search (DFS):
1. **First DFS**:
    - Calculate the subtree sizes and the sum of distances for a root node (say 0).
    - This helps us get the total distance of the root from all other nodes and the size of the subtree rooted at each node.
    
2. **Second DFS**:
    - Propagate the distances from the root to all other nodes using the already computed values.
    - For a node `u` and its child `v`, if we know the sum of distances for `u`, the sum of distances for `v` can be computed using a simple relationship derived from the properties of the tree.

### Code
```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def sumOfDistancesInTree(self, n: int, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        tree = defaultdict(list)
        for u, v in edges:
            tree[u].append(v)
            tree[v].append(u)

        count = [1] * n
        res = [0] * n

        def dfs(node, parent):
            for neighbor in tree[node]:
                if neighbor != parent:
                    dfs(neighbor, node)
                    count[node] += count[neighbor]
                    res[node] += res[neighbor] + count[neighbor]

        def dfs2(node, parent):
            for neighbor in tree[node]:
                if neighbor != parent:
                    res[neighbor] = res[node] - count[neighbor] + (n - count[neighbor])
                    dfs2(neighbor, node)

        dfs(0, -1)
        dfs2(0, -1)
        return res
```

### Time Complexity
- **First DFS**: O(n), as we visit each node once and process its neighbors.
- **Second DFS**: O(n), as we again visit each node once.
Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n), which is efficient given the constraints.
