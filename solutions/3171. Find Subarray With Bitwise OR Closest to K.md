title:  Find Subarray With Bitwise OR Closest to K-out
permalink: /s3171
---

Given an array `nums` of size `n` and an integer `k`, find the subarray with the Bitwise OR result closest to `k`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the subarray be of any length from 0 to n?**
   - Yes, subarrays can range from a single element up to the entire array.
   
2. **What do we return if there are multiple subarrays equidistant to `k` in terms of the OR operation?**
   - Return the one that appears first in terms of starting index; if there are still ties, return the shortest one.

3. **What is the range of the integer values within the `nums` array and the integer `k`?**
   - The elements of `nums` and `k` are integers typically within the range of values that can be represented in 32-bit signed integers.

4. **What is the expected length of the array `nums` (n)?**
   - This can affect the algorithm's efficiency. Typical constraints need to be defined, but let's assume `n` can go up to 100,000 for a robust solution.

5. **Is the array guaranteed to have non-negative integers only?**
   - Assuming there can be non-negative integers only for simplicity unless specified otherwise.

## Strategy

1. **Bitwise OR Property**: A bitwise OR operation is cumulative; i.e., it will always lead to a number greater than or equal to the original. This could be incrementally calculated. 
2. **Choosing Subarray**: Iterate over all possible subarrays, compute their bitwise OR and track the subarray with OR value closest to `k`.
3. **Maintaining Closest Value**: Keep track of the minimum difference between the bitwise OR value and `k`. 

## Code

```python
def findSubarrayClosestToK(nums, k):
    n = nums.length
    closest_val = float('inf')
    closest_subarray = (0, 0)

    for i in range(n):
        or_result = 0
        for j in range(i, n):
            or_result |= nums[j]
            
            current_diff = abs(or_result - k)
            best_diff = abs(closest_val - k)
            
            if current_diff < best_diff:
                closest_val = or_result
                closest_subarray = (i, j)
            elif current_diff == best_diff:
                if (j - i) < (closest_subarray[1] - closest_subarray[0]):
                    closest_val = or_result
                    closest_subarray = (i, j)
    
    return closest_subarray

# Testing the function with an example:
nums = [1, 2, 4, 7]
k = 5
print(findSubarrayClosestToK(nums, k))  # Example output might be (0, 3)
```

## Time Complexity

- **Outer Loop**: runs `n` times (for each start index).
- **Inner Loop**: runs `n-i` times in the worst case for each `i`.
- **Bitwise Operations**: each operation is O(1), but they are nested in loops.

This results in an overall time complexity of `O(n^2)` in the worst-case scenario. Given a large input size (up to 100,000), an `O(n^2)` solution might be computationally expensive, suggesting the need for additional optimizations or different approaches for significantly large inputs.
