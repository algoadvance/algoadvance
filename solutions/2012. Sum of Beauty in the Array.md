title:  Sum of Beauty in the Array-out
permalink: /s2012

The problem "2012. Sum of Beauty in the Array" from LeetCode can be stated as follows:

**Given an integer array `nums`, the beauty of a number `nums[i]` is defined as:**

- 2, if `nums[i]` is strictly greater than all elements to its left and strictly smaller than all elements to its right.
- 1, if `nums[i]` is strictly greater than all elements to its left, but not strictly smaller than all elements to its right.
- 0, if neither of the above conditions is met.

The beauty of the array is the sum of the beauty of all `nums[i]` where `1 <= i <= n - 2` (i.e., we skip the first and last elements of the array).

Write a function that computes the beauty of the array.

**Example:**
```python
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation:
For nums[1]=2: all elements to the left of nums[1]: [1], all elements to the right of nums[1]: [3].
nums[1] is strictly greater than all elements to the left and strictly smaller than all elements to the right, so beauty(nums[1]) = 2.
For nums[2]=3: all elements to the left of nums[2]: [1,2], all elements to the right of nums[2]: [].
There are no elements to the right, so beauty(nums[2]) = 0.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input array contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the array can contain negative numbers.
2. **What is the length of the input array?**
   - The problem is valid for arrays of length `n` where `n >= 3`.
3. **Are there any constraints on the values within the array?**
   - No specific constraints are mentioned beyond typical integer range constraints.

## Code

Here is the implementation of the solution in Python:

```python
def sumOfBeauties(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    if n < 3:
        return 0

    # Create prefix maximum array
    max_left = [0] * n
    max_left[0] = nums[0]
    for i in range(1, n):
        max_left[i] = max(max_left[i - 1], nums[i])

    # Create suffix minimum array
    min_right = [0] * n
    min_right[-1] = nums[-1]
    for i in range(n - 2, -1, -1):
        min_right[i] = min(min_right[i + 1], nums[i])

    beauty_sum = 0

    for i in range(1, n - 1):
        if max_left[i - 1] < nums[i] < min_right[i + 1]:
            beauty_sum += 2
        elif nums[i] > nums[i - 1] and nums[i] < nums[i + 1]:
            beauty_sum += 1

    return beauty_sum
```

## Strategy

1. **Initialize Arrays for Maximums and Minimums**:
   - Construct `max_left` where `max_left[i]` holds the maximum value from the start of the array up to index `i`.
   - Construct `min_right` where `min_right[i]` holds the minimum value from index `i` to the end of the array.

2. **Calculate Beauty**:
   - For each element `nums[i]` where `1 <= i <= n-2`:
     - Check if it is greater than all elements to its left (`max_left[i-1]`) and less than all elements to its right (`min_right[i+1]`).
     - Otherwise, check if it is strictly greater than nums[i-1] and strictly smaller than nums[i+1].

3. **Sum the Beauties**:
   - Sum all computed beauties and return the total.

## Time Complexity

- **Creating prefix maximum and suffix minimum arrays**: `O(n)`
- **Iterating through the array to compute beauty**: `O(n)`

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n)`. This is efficient and suitable for typical input sizes in competitive programming. The space complexity is also `O(n)` due to the additional arrays used for maximum and minimum computations.
