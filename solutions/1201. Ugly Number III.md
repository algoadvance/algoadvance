permalink: /s1201
---
Given four integers `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, return the `n`th ugly number. Ugly numbers are positive integers which are divisible by `a`, `b`, or `c`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 3, a = 2, b = 3, c = 5
Output: 4
Explanation: The first 3 ugly numbers are 2, 3, and 4.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 4, a = 2, b = 3, c = 4
Output: 6
Explanation: The first 4 ugly numbers are 2, 3, 4, and 6.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: n = 5, a = 2, b = 11, c = 13
Output: 10
Explanation: The first 5 ugly numbers are 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10.
```

### Example 4:
```
Input: n = 1000000000, a = 2, b = 217983653, c = 336916467
Output: 1999999984
```

## Clarifying Questions:
1. How large can the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` be?
   - The constraints are: `1 <= n, a, b, c <= 10^9`.
   
2. Are all inputs guaranteed to be positive integers?
   - Yes.

3. Is there any specific order required in the output sequence of ugly numbers?
   - No, we only need to find the `n`th ugly number. The sequence order isn't relevant.

## Strategy:
1. The goal is to find the `n`th ugly number divisible by `a`, `b`, or `c`. Since direct computation would be inefficient due to large constraints, we can utilize a binary search approach.
2. Define `L = 1` and `R = 2 * 10^9`. We continue adjusting `L` and `R` until `L < R`.
3. For a middle value `mid`, compute how many numbers are divisible by `a`, `b`, or `c` up to `mid` using the Inclusion-Exclusion Principle:
   - `num_ugly = mid // a + mid // b + mid // c - mid // lcm(a, b) - mid // lcm(b, c) - mid // lcm(c, a) + mid // lcm(a, b, c)`.
4. Adjust `L` and `R` based on the value of `num_ugly` compared to `n`.

## Code:

```python
import math

def lcm(x, y):
    return (x * y) // math.gcd(x, y)

def ugly_number(n, a, b, c):
    left, right = 1, 2 * 10**9

    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        
        # Calculate how many numbers <= mid are divisible by a, b, or c
        ab = lcm(a, b)
        bc = lcm(b, c)
        ca = lcm(c, a)
        abc = lcm(a, bc)
        
        num_ugly = (mid // a) + (mid // b) + (mid // c) - (mid // ab) - (mid // bc) - (mid // ca) + (mid // abc)

        if num_ugly < n:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid
    
    return left

# Example test case:
print(ugly_number(3, 2, 3, 5))  # Output: 4
print(ugly_number(4, 2, 3, 4))  # Output: 6
```


## Time Complexity:
1. **Binary Search:** The binary search is performed over the range `[1, 2*10^9]`, which results in approximately `log2(2*10^9) ~ 31` iterations.
2. **GCD and LCM computations:** Each iteration involves a constant number of GCD/LCM calculations and simple arithmetic, which are all O(log(min(a, b, c))).

Thus, **Overall Time Complexity:** `O(log(n))`, where `n` is the high limit 2 * 10^9.

This approach is efficient and adheres to the constraints provided in the problem statement.
