title:  Partition Array for Maximum Sum-out
permalink: /s1043
---
Given an integer array `arr`, you will partition the array into (possibly zero) subarrays of at most length `k`. After partitioning, each subarray has their values changed to become the maximum value of that subarray.

Return the largest sum of the given array after partitioning.

#### Example:
- **Input**: `arr = [1,15,7,9,2,5,10]`, `k = 3`
- **Output**: `84`
  
#### Explanation:
- The array `[1,15,7,9,2,5,10]` can be partitioned into `[1,15,15,15,15,15,15]` for a sum of 1 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 15 + 8 = 84.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: Can the array be empty?**
   - A: No, the array will have at least one element.
2. **Q: What are the maximum values for the elements in the array and `k`?**
   - A: The elements in the array can be up to 10^4 and the length `k` can be up to 500.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, a dynamic programming approach can be employed:
- Define `dp[i]` as the maximum sum we can achieve for the subarray `arr[0:i]`.
- Iterate through each position `i` in the array and consider all possible subarray lengths `1` to `k` ending at `i`.
- For each length `j`, calculate the maximum value in the subarray `arr[i-j:i]` and update `dp[i]` based on the subarray's contribution to the total sum.

### Code
Here is a Python implementation using the described strategy:

```python
def maxSumAfterPartitioning(arr, k):
    n = len(arr)
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        current_max = 0
        for j in range(1, min(k, i) + 1):
            current_max = max(current_max, arr[i - j])
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i - j] + current_max * j)
    
    return dp[n]

# Example usage:
arr = [1, 15, 7, 9, 2, 5, 10]
k = 3
print(maxSumAfterPartitioning(arr, k))  # Output: 84
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * k)
  - We iteratively calculate `dp[i]` for each `i` from 1 to `n`. For each `i`, we can have up to `k` iterations finding the maximum value in the range and updating dp, leading to an overall complexity of O(n * k).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - We use an array `dp` of size `n + 1` to store the maximum sums for each subarray length.

This approach efficiently partitions the array while ensuring the maximum possible sum is achieved using dynamic programming.
