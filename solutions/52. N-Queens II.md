The N-Queens puzzle is the problem of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard so that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer n, return the number of distinct solutions to the N-Queens puzzle.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input & Output:**
    - **Input:** An integer `n` representing the size of the chessboard and the number of queens.
    - **Output:** An integer representing the number of distinct solutions.

2. **Constraints:**
    - `1 <= n <= 9` (as per typical constraints for problems relating to N-Queens).

3. **Assumptions:**
    - A solution should ensure that no two queens attack each other horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we will use a recursive backtracking approach:

1. **Backtracking:** We will attempt to place a queen in each row one by one and use recursion to solve subsequent rows.
2. **Safety Check:** For every placement of a queen, ensure that it does not clash with previously placed queens. This can be done using three sets:
    - `columns`: to track columns being occupied by queens.
    - `diagonals1`: to track diagonals from top-left to bottom-right.
    - `diagonals2`: to track diagonals from top-right to bottom-left.

### Implementation Steps

1. Define a recursive function to place queens.
2. For each row, try placing a queen in each column:
    - If a cell is safe (i.e., not under attack by any previously placed queen), place the queen and mark the column and diagonals as occupied.
    - Move to the next row recursively.
    - If we've placed queens in all rows (base case), increment the solution count.
3. Backtrack by removing the queen and unmarking the column and diagonals.
4. Start with the first row and an initial count of 0 solutions.

## Code

```python
def totalNQueens(n: int) -> int:
    def backtrack(row: int) -> None:
        nonlocal count
        if row == n:  # All queens are placed successfully
            count += 1
            return
        
        for col in range(n):
            if col not in columns and (row - col) not in diagonals1 and (row + col) not in diagonals2:
                # Place the queen
                columns.add(col)
                diagonals1.add(row - col)
                diagonals2.add(row + col)
                
                # Move to the next row
                backtrack(row + 1)
                
                # Remove the queen (backtracking)
                columns.remove(col)
                diagonals1.remove(row - col)
                diagonals2.remove(row + col)
    
    columns = set()
    diagonals1 = set()
    diagonals2 = set()
    count = 0
    
    backtrack(0)  # Start with the first row
    return count
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this backtracking solution is generally considered to be O(N!), as we try to place a queen in N possible positions in each row and backtrack accordingly. Each successful placement leads to a reduction in possibilities as the problem size reduces, thus giving the factorial-like complexity behavior. However, there are optimizations that prevent this from being a straightforward factorial growth.
