title:  Minimum Seconds to Equalize a Circular Array-out
permalink: /s2808
---

You are given a circular array `nums` of size `n`. In one second, you can rotate the circular array by one position to the right where the last element of the array becomes the first element of the array.

You need to find the minimum number of such rotations required so that all elements in the array become equal. 

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of the values in the `nums` array?
   - The values are integers and there may be a wide range, but this doesn't affect the logic.
  
2. Is there a specific position in the array that we start rotating from?
   - No, any position can be the start point for calculating the rotations.

3. Can the array be already equal?
   - Yes, if all elements are already equal, the number of required rotations would be 0.

4. What is the value of `n` (the length of the array)?
   - `n` can be any size within the computational constraints of the problem.

Given these points, let's proceed with the solution.

## Strategy

1. **Identify Unique Elements**:
   - First, identify the unique elements in the array since we want all elements to be equal eventually.

2. **Count Rotations**:
   - For each unique element, use two pointers to check how many rotations are needed to make all elements the same as this unique element.
   
3. **Calculate Minimum Rotations**:
   - Keep track of the minimum number of rotations required for any of the unique elements to make the entire array equal.

## Code

```python
def min_seconds_to_equalize_circular_array(nums):
    n = len(nums)
    unique_elements = set(nums)
    res = float('inf')
    
    for target in unique_elements:
        max_gap = 0
        last_seen = -1
        
        for i in range(2 * n):
            current_idx = i % n
            if nums[current_idx] == target:
                if last_seen != -1:
                    max_gap = max(max_gap, i - last_seen - 1)
                last_seen = i
        
        res = min(res, (max_gap + 1) // 2)
    
    return res

# Example usage
print(min_seconds_to_equalize_circular_array([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 1]))
```

## Explanation

1. **Identify Unique Elements**:
   - We extract the unique elements from the array.

2. **Double the Array for Circularity**:
   - We double the array conceptually by checking twice the length, but still use modulo to achieve the circular array effect without explicitly creating a new array.

3. **Track Gaps**:
   - For each unique element, we track the maximum gap between consecutive identical elements in their positions as it defines the number of rotations needed.

4. **Compute Minimum**:
   - The result is minimized across all possible values.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
  - The outer loop runs over unique elements, which in the worst case could be `O(n)`.
  - The inner for-loop runs `O(2n)`, where we simulate the circular structure.
  - Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(n^2)` in the worst case due to the unique elements' potential count being `n`.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity mainly includes the `unique_elements` set and additional variables, making it `O(n)`.

This approach efficiently navigates through the constraints provided in the problem statement.
