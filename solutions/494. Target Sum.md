You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `target`.

You want to build an expression out of `nums` by adding one of the symbols `'+'` and `'-'` before each integer in `nums` and then concatenate all the integers.

- For example, if `nums = [2, 1]`, you can add a `'+'` before `2` and a `'-'` before `1` and concatenate them to build the expression `"+2-1"`.

Return the number of different expressions that you can build, which evaluates to `target`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Are the elements of `nums` always integers?**
   - Yes.
   
2. **Can `nums` contain negative numbers?**
   - No, based on the problem constraints, `nums` contains only non-negative numbers.
   
3. **Is there any constraint on the size of `nums`?**
   - Yes, the size can be up to `20`.
   
4. **What is the maximum absolute value of `target`?**
   - The maximum absolute value of `target` can be up to `1000`.

### Strategy:

We need to determine how many ways we can use `+` and `-` operators in front of the numbers in the `nums` array such that the resultant expression evaluates to `target`. The strategy I'll use to solve this problem is Depth-First Search (DFS) in combination with memoization to avoid recomputation of results.

1. **Define a DFS function:**
   - This will recursively try both adding and subtracting the current number.
   
2. **Memoization:**
   - Use a dictionary to store and reuse intermediate results (tuples representing current index and current cumulative sum).

### Code:

```python
def findTargetSumWays(nums, target):
    memo = {}
    
    def dfs(i, total):
        if i == len(nums):
            return 1 if total == target else 0
        if (i, total) in memo:
            return memo[(i, total)]
        
        # Calculate result by adding and subtracting the current number
        add = dfs(i + 1, total + nums[i])
        subtract = dfs(i + 1, total - nums[i])
        
        memo[(i, total)] = add + subtract
        return memo[(i, total)]
    
    return dfs(0, 0)
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:**
  - `O(n * s)` where `n` is the length of `nums` and `s` is the sum of elements in `nums`.
  - This is because each subproblem is defined by an index and a sum `total`, leading to at most `n * 2s` subproblems.
  
- **Space Complexity:**
  - `O(n * s)` for the memo dictionary and the call stack in worst case scenario.
