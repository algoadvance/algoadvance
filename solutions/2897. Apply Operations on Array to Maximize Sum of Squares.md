title:  Apply Operations on Array to Maximize Sum of Squares-out
permalink: /s2897
---

You are given an array `nums` and an integer `k`. You need to apply the following operation exactly `k` times:

1. Choose an element from `nums` and increment it by 1.
2. The goal is to maximize the sum of squares of the elements in the array after performing the operations.

Return the maximum possible sum of the squares of the elements in the array.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Can elements in `nums` be negative?**
   - Yes, elements can be negative.
2. **Can `k` be larger than the length of `nums`?**
   - Yes, `k` can be larger, but you'll apply the increment operations `k` times no matter what.
3. **Is the order of the elements in `nums` important?**
   - No, the order does not matter. We are just interested in maximizing the sum of squares.

### Strategy:

To maximize the sum of squares after `k` operations, we should always increment the smallest element in the array `nums`. Incrementing the smallest element gives the largest marginal increase in the sum of squares.

Here's the step-by-step strategy:
1. Use a min-heap to efficiently keep track of the smallest elements. Python's `heapq` can be used for this purpose.
2. Extract the smallest element, increment it, and push it back into the heap.
3. Repeat step 2 for `k` times.
4. After k operations, calculate the sum of squares.

### Code:

```python
import heapq

def maximizeSumOfSquares(nums, k):
    # Convert nums into a min-heap.
    heapq.heapify(nums)
    
    # Perform the operation k times.
    for _ in range(k):
        # Extract the smallest element.
        smallest = heapq.heappop(nums)
        # Increment it.
        smallest += 1
        # Push it back into the heap.
        heapq.heappush(nums, smallest)
    
    # Compute the sum of squares.
    sum_of_squares = sum(x * x for x in nums)
    
    return sum_of_squares

# Example usage
nums = [1, 2, 3]
k = 3
print(maximizeSumOfSquares(nums, k))  # Output should be 19
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Heap Construction**: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the array.
- **K Operations**: Each `heappop` and `heappush` operation is `O(log n)`, and we do this `k` times, so this part is `O(k log n)`.
- **Sum of Squares Calculation**: `O(n)` for calculating the sum of squares.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n + k log n)`, which is efficient given typical constraints.

### Note:

This approach efficiently handles the requirement to apply the operation exactly `k` times while ensuring that we always increment the smallest element, thus maximizing the marginal increase in the sum of squares.
