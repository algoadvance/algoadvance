title:  Alternating Digit Sum-out
permalink: /s2544
---

Given a positive integer `n`, return the **alternating sum** of its digits starting from the leftmost digit. The alternating sum of a number is defined as:

- Add the first digit.
- Subtract the second digit.
- Add the third digit.
- Subtract the fourth digit.
- And so on...

### Example

1. Input: `n = 521`
   Output: `5 - 2 + 1 = 4`
2. Input: `n = 111`
   Output: `1 - 1 + 1 = 1`
   
### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of n**:
   - What is the range of the integer `n`? (Assuming it is a positive integer and fits within standard integer limits.)
   
2. **Edge cases**:
   - How should the algorithm handle single-digit numbers or numbers with leading zeros?

For the sake of simplicity, let’s assume `n` is a positive integer with no leading zeros.

### Strategy

1. **Convert the Integer to String**:
   - Convert the integer `n` to its string representation to easily access each digit.

2. **Initialize the Sum**:
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the sum (`alternating_sum = 0`).

3. **Iterate Over Digits**:
   - Loop through each digit, convert it back to an integer, and apply the alternating sum logic:
     - For even indexed digits (0-based), add the digit.
     - For odd indexed digits, subtract the digit.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - After processing all digits, return the value of `alternating_sum`.

### Code

```python
def alternatingDigitSum(n: int) -> int:
    n_str = str(n)
    alternating_sum = 0
    
    # Iterate over the digits and apply the alternating sum logic
    for idx, digit in enumerate(n_str):
        digit = int(digit)
        if idx % 2 == 0:
            alternating_sum += digit
        else:
            alternating_sum -= digit
    
    return alternating_sum

# Example usage
print(alternatingDigitSum(521))  # Output: 4
print(alternatingDigitSum(111))  # Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(d)**, where `d` is the number of digits in the integer `n`. This is because we are iterating over each digit exactly once. The conversion from integer to string and integer parsing operations inside the loop are all `O(1)` operations for each digit.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is **O(1)**, as we are using a constant amount of space irrespective of the input size. The string representation of `n` and the integer sum variable don’t scale with input size in a way that affects asymptotic complexity.
