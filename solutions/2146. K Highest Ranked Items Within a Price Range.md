title:  K Highest Ranked Items Within a Price Range-out
permalink: /s2146
---

You are given a 2D grid containing items represented by integers. The integers are:
- `0` indicates an empty cell,
- `1` indicates an obstacle (cannot move through or place an item on),
- positive integers greater than 1 represent items with a price.

Additionally, you are given:
- A 2-tuple `start` representing the starting point in the grid,
- Two integers `price_a` and `price_b` representing the inclusive price range [price_a, price_b],
- An integer `k` representing the number of items to return.

Your task is to return a list of the k highest ranked items within the given price range sorted by:
1. The shortest distance from the starting point,
2. Price (lower prices come first if distances are the same),
3. Location (row first, then column) if both distance and price are the same.

If there are fewer than k items within the range, return all those items. If no items are found, return an empty list.

## Clarifying Questions
1. How should the distance be calculated?
   - Distance is calculated using Manhattan distance.
2. Can we move diagonally?
   - No, you can only move up, down, left, and right.
3. Should we consider boundaries while moving?
   - Yes, the movements must be within the grid boundaries.
4. Are there any edge cases we need to consider?
   - Yes, consider edge cases where the grid is empty, or the start position itself is an obstacle, or there are no items within the given price range.

## Strategy
1. Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore the grid starting from the 'start' position.
2. Collect items that fall within the price range [price_a, price_b].
3. Priority queue (min-heap) will be used to keep the items sorted according to:
   - Distance from the start,
   - Price,
   - Row and column locations.
4. Extract `k` items from the priority queue and return them.

### Code

```python
from heapq import heappush, heappop
from collections import deque

def highestRankedKItems(grid, pricing, start, k):
    ROWS, COLS = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    price_a, price_b = pricing
    start_row, start_col = start
    
    # Directions for moving in the grid.
    DIRECTIONS = [(0, 1), (1, 0), (0, -1), (-1, 0)]
    
    # Function to determine if a point is within bounds and not an obstacle.
    def is_valid(r, c):
        return 0 <= r < ROWS and 0 <= c < COLS and grid[r][c] != 1
    
    # BFS initialization
    queue = deque([(start_row, start_col, 0)])  # (row, col, distance)
    visited = set((start_row, start_col))
    result = []
    
    # Perform BFS
    while queue:
        r, c, dist = queue.popleft()
        
        # If it's an item within the price range, add to the heap.
        if price_a <= grid[r][c] <= price_b:
            heappush(result, (dist, grid[r][c], r, c))
        
        # Explore neighbors
        for dr, dc in DIRECTIONS:
            nr, nc = r + dr, c + dc
            if is_valid(nr, nc) and (nr, nc) not in visited:
                visited.add((nr, nc))
                queue.append((nr, nc, dist + 1))
    
    # Extract the top k items
    final_items = []
    while k > 0 and result:
        _, _, r, c = heappop(result)
        final_items.append([r, c])
        k -= 1
    
    return final_items

# Example usage:
grid = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [0, 3, 4],
    [7, 6, 5]
]
pricing = [2, 5]
start = [0, 0]
k = 3
print(highestRankedKItems(grid, pricing, start, k))  # Expected output: [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2]]
```

### Time Complexity
1. **BFS Traversal:** O(R * C) where R is the number of rows and C is the number of columns.
2. **Heap Operations:** In the worst case, all cells can be pushed to the heap, so each push/pop operation would take O(log(R * C)).

Combining both, the overall time complexity is **O(R * C log(R * C))**.
