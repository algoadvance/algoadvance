title:  Count Array Pairs Divisible by K-out
permalink: /s2183
---

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Return the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that:

- `0 <= i < j < nums.length`
- `nums[i] * nums[j]` is divisible by `k`

## Clarifying questions

1. Can the elements in `nums` be negative?
2. Can `k` be zero (though that might not be meaningful for division)?
3. Is there a limit on the size of `nums` or the range of its elements?

For simplicity, let's assume:
- The elements in `nums` are non-negative.
- `k` is a positive integer.
- The size of `nums` and the values within are within reasonable constraints for standard computational limits.

Let's proceed with the solution.

## Strategy

1. **Factor Decomposition**: We need to analyze the factors of each number in `nums` relative to `k`.
2. **Counting Pairs**: We will count the pairs `(i, j)` where the product `nums[i] * nums[j]` is divisible by `k`.
3. **Use of Dictionary**: Utilize a dictionary to track the frequency of elements in `nums` that leave specific remainders when divided by `k`.

### Steps

1. Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of each element in `nums` with `k`. This helps in reducing the problem complexity.
2. Use a dictionary to store the counts of these GCD values.
3. Iterate through the elements and use the stored counts to determine valid pairs.

## Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict
from math import gcd

def countPairs(nums, k):
    # Count the frequency of gcd(nums[i], k)
    gcd_count = defaultdict(int)
    
    for num in nums:
        g = gcd(num, k)
        gcd_count[g] += 1
    
    result = 0
    keys = list(gcd_count.keys())
    
    # Loop through the gcd keys
    for i in range(len(keys)):
        for j in range(i, len(keys)):
            if (keys[i] * keys[j]) % k == 0:
                if i == j:
                    # If both indexes are same (self-pairs), choose 2 out of count
                    result += gcd_count[keys[i]] * (gcd_count[keys[i]] - 1) // 2
                else:
                    # Pairs from different elements
                    result += gcd_count[keys[i]] * gcd_count[keys[j]]
    
    return result

# Example Usage
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
k = 2
print(countPairs(nums, k))  # Output should be the number of valid pairs
```

## Time Complexity

- **Pre-processing**: Calculating GCD for each element in `nums` has a complexity of O(n log k), where n is the length of nums.
- **Counting pairs**: The nested loops for computing valid pairs in the worst case would be around `O(m^2)`, where `m` is the number of distinct gcd values, which in the worst scenario is âˆšn.

Thus, overall complexity is dominated by O(n log k + m^2).

This approach is efficient for typical constraints seen in competitive programming and interview scenarios.
