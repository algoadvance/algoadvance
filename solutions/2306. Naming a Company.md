title:  Naming a Company-out
permalink: /s2306
---
You are given an array of strings `ideas` that represents a list of the potential names for your company. The process for naming a company involves the following steps:

1. Choose 2 distinct names from `ideas`, call them `ideaA` and `ideaB`.
2. Swap the first letters of `ideaA` and `ideaB`.
3. If both of the new names are not present in the `ideas` list, then they are valid company names.

Return the number of distinct and valid company names.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: ideas = ["coffee","donuts","time","toffee"]
Output: 6
Explanation: The following pairs of names are valid:
- ("coffee", "donuts"): swap to get ("doffee", "conuts") which are both not in the list.
- ("coffee", "time"): swap to get ("toffee", "cime") which are both not in the list.
- ("coffee", "toffee"): swap to get ("toffee", "coffee") which are both not in the list.
- ("donuts", "time"): swap to get ("timuts", "done") which are both not in the list.
- ("donuts", "toffee"): swap to get ("tonuts", "doffee") which are both not in the list.
- ("time", "toffee"): swap to get ("toime", "tiffee") which are both not in the list.
```

### Constraints
- `2 <= ideas.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `1 <= ideas[i].length <= 10`
- `ideas[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
- All the strings in ideas are unique.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Clarification on Valid Company Names:** Are we to consider company names that are the same as the original input list once swapped? No, they must both not exist in the `ideas` list.
2. **Constraints on uniqueness:** Can there be duplicate names within the list? No, all names are guaranteed to be unique.
3. **Name characters:** All names consist of lowercase English letters only?

## Strategy
1. **Data Structure:** Utilize a set to store the original ideas for O(1) look-up times.
2. **Grouping by Suffixes:** Group the ideas by their prefixes. This helps find swap-potential names.
3. **First Letter Buckets:** Create a list of sets where each index represents a letter from 'a' to 'z' containing the suffixes associated with that initial letter.
4. **Counting Valid Pairs:** Iterate over pairs of different letters to count valid swaps.

## Code
```python
def distinctNames(ideas):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Group ideas by their initial character
    suffix_groups = defaultdict(set)
    
    for idea in ideas:
        suffix_groups[idea[0]].add(idea[1:])
    
    total_pairs = 0
    
    # Convert suffix groups dict to a list of items
    suffix_lists = list(suffix_groups.items())
    
    # Iterate over pairs of different initial characters
    for i in range(len(suffix_lists)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(suffix_lists)):
            char_a, suffixes_a = suffix_lists[i]
            char_b, suffixes_b = suffix_lists[j]
            
            # Find intersection&difference of suffixes to determine valid swaps
            common_suffixes = suffixes_a & suffixes_b
            valid_a_to_b = len(suffixes_a - common_suffixes)
            valid_b_to_a = len(suffixes_b - common_suffixes)
            
            total_pairs += valid_a_to_b * valid_b_to_a
    
    return total_pairs
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Group ideas by prefix:** O(N) where N is the length of the `ideas` list.
2. **Nested loops over distinct letters**: O(25^2) = O(625), which is constant.
3. **Set operations within nested loops:** The intersections and difference operations average O(L), where L is the length of the idea.
4. Thus, overall time complexity approximates to **O(N)** making it efficient for the given constraints.
