title:  Number of Subarrays with Bounded Maximum-out
permalink: /s795
---

You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `left` and `right`. Return the number of contiguous subarrays where the value of the maximum array element in that subarray is in the range `[left, right]`.

#### Example:
- Input: `nums = [2, 1, 4, 3]`, `left = 2`, `right = 3`
- Output: `3`
- Explanation: There are three subarrays that meet the criteria: `[2]`, `[2, 1]`, and `[3]`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the conditions for the elements of `nums`?**
   - Elements of `nums` are integers.
   
2. **What is the range for the values of `nums` and the bounds `left` and `right`?**
   - The values of `nums`, `left`, and `right` are all integers, where: 
     - `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
     - `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
     - `0 <= left <= right <= 10^9`

3. **Are the subarrays contiguous?**
   - Yes, the problem specifically requires contiguous subarrays.

### Strategy

We'll utilize a two-pointer approach to solve this problem efficiently:
1. We'll iterate through the array using a single pass.
2. Use two variables:
   - `start`: to track the beginning of the current subarray.
   - `count`: to count valid subarrays ending at the current index.
3. If the current element is within the bounds `[left, right]`, it extends the number of valid subarrays ending at the current index.
4. If it exceeds `right`, reset the count of valid subarrays as it breaks the subarray constraint.
5. If itâ€™s less than `left`, continue and add previous valid subarrays to the result.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because we iterate through the array once.

### Code Implementation

Here is the Python implementation following the above strategy:

```python
def numSubarrayBoundedMax(nums, left, right):
    start = 0
    count = 0
    result = 0
    prev_count = 0
    
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if left <= nums[i] <= right:
            count = i - start + 1
            prev_count = count
        elif nums[i] < left:
            # This subarray can be part of a valid subarray if previous elements were valid
            count = prev_count
        else: # nums[i] > right
            start = i + 1
            count = 0
            prev_count = 0
        
        result += count
        
    return result

# Example usage:
nums = [2, 1, 4, 3]
left = 2
right = 3
print(numSubarrayBoundedMax(nums, left, right))  # Output: 3
```

This solution ensures we efficiently count the valid subarrays by only iterating through the list once and keeping track of the count of valid subarrays incrementally.
