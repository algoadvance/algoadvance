### Problem Statement:

Tag Validator: Given a string representing a code snippet, you need to validate whether it is a valid code snippet according to the following rules:

1. **Tags**: 
    - Code must use valid closed tags. 
    - A valid closed tag must be in the form of `<TAG_NAME>TAG_CONTENT</TAG_NAME>`. A `TAG_NAME` consists of upper-case letters, and `TAG_CONTENT` can be another valid closed tag, cdata, or anything.

2. **CDATA**:
    - CDATA is a special version of content that does not need to be validated within enclosed tags. CDATA can appear anywhere.
    - A CDATA is defined as `<![CDATA[CDATA_CONTENT]]>`. The `CDATA_CONTENT` can be any characters.

3. **Tag Rules**:
    - A starting tag should be closed with the exact matching closing tag.
    - It is not allowed to open a tag inside the CDATA section.

4. **Nested rules**:
    - Nested tags are allowed, but they must be nested correctly.
    - `<A><B></B></A>` is valid but `<A><B></A></B>` is invalid.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. Can we assume that the input will not be empty, or do we need to handle empty inputs?
2. Are there any other constraints that need to be considered (e.g., maximum length of the string)?
3. Should the solution handle only well-formed strings (e.g., strings with only valid characters and patterns)?

### Code:

Here's a Python solution to validate the tags given the rules above:

```python
def isValid(code: str) -> bool:
    def is_valid_tag_name(tag):
        return 1 <= len(tag) <= 9 and tag.isalpha() and tag.isupper()
    
    i, n = 0, len(code)
    stack = []

    while i < n:
        if code.startswith('<![CDATA[', i):
            j = i + 9
            i = code.find(']]>', j)
            if i == -1:
                return False
            i += 3
        elif code.startswith('</', i):
            j = i + 2
            i = code.find('>', j)
            if i == -1:
                return False
            tag = code[j:i]
            if len(stack) == 0 or stack[-1] != tag:
                return False
            stack.pop()
            i += 1
            if len(stack) == 0 and i != n:
                return False
        elif code.startswith('<', i):
            j = i + 1
            i = code.find('>', j)
            if i == -1:
                return False
            tag = code[j:i]
            if not is_valid_tag_name(tag):
                return False
            stack.append(tag)
            i += 1
        else:
            if len(stack) == 0:
                return False
            i += 1
    
    return len(stack) == 0

# Example usage:
code = "<A><B>good_content</B></A>"
print(isValid(code))  # Output: True

code = "<A></A><B></B>"
print(isValid(code))  # Output: False
```

### Strategy:

1. **Tag Handling**:
    - Use a stack to manage opening and closing tags. Push onto the stack when encountering an opening tag and pop from the stack when encountering the corresponding closing tag.
    - Validate that the tag name is between 1-9 characters and all upper case.

2. **CDATA Handling**:
    - When encountering CDATA, simply skip over the entire section as CDATA content does not need validation.

3. **Validation**:
    - Ensure the opening and closing tags match up correctly.
    - Check for improperly placed content outside of tags and manage nested tags appropriately.

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this approach is O(N), where N is the length of the string. This is because we iterate through the string once, with operations such as checking substrings or pushing/popping from the stack being O(1). The space complexity is also O(N) due to the stack used to keep track of the open tags.
