title:  Satisfiability of Equality Equations-out
permalink: /s990
---
Given an array of strings `equations` representing relationships between variables, each string `equations[i]` is of the form `"a==b"` or `"a!=b"`, where `a` and `b` are lowercase letters. You need to determine if it is possible to assign integers to the variables such that all the given equations are satisfied. If it is possible, return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Q:** Can the input contain invalid equations (e.g., "a==a", "a!=a")?
   **A:** No, the input will be valid.
2. **Q:** What is the maximum length of the `equations` array?
   **A:** Each string in `equations` will have a length of exactly 4. The total number of equations will not exceed 500.

### Strategy:
1. **Union-Find Data Structure:** 
   - Use the Union-Find (also known as Disjoint Set Union, DSU) to manage the equivalence classes of variables.
   - Process equality equations (`==`) first to group variables together.
   - Then, process inequality equations (`!=`) to check for any conflicts.

2. **Steps:**
   - Initialize Union-Find data structure for 26 possible lowercase variables (`a` to `z`).
   - For each equation of the form `a==b`, unite the sets containing `a` and `b`.
   - For each equation of the form `a!=b`, check if `a` and `b` belong to the same set. If they do, return `False`.
   - If all constraints are satisfied, return `True`.

### Code Implementation:

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.parent = list(range(size))
        self.rank = [1] * size

    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])  # Path compression
        return self.parent[x]

    def union(self, x, y):
        rootX = self.find(x)
        rootY = self.find(y)

        if rootX != rootY:
            if self.rank[rootX] > self.rank[rootY]:
                self.parent[rootY] = rootX
            elif self.rank[rootX] < self.rank[rootY]:
                self.parent[rootX] = rootY
            else:
                self.parent[rootY] = rootX
                self.rank[rootX] += 1


def equationsPossible(equations):
    union_find = UnionFind(26)
    
    # First pass: Process all equality equations
    for eq in equations:
        if eq[1:3] == '==':
            x = ord(eq[0]) - ord('a')
            y = ord(eq[3]) - ord('a')
            union_find.union(x, y)
    
    # Second pass: Process all inequality equations
    for eq in equations:
        if eq[1:3] == '!=':
            x = ord(eq[0]) - ord('a')
            y = ord(eq[3]) - ord('a')
            if union_find.find(x) == union_find.find(y):
                return False
    
    return True
```

### Time Complexity:
The Union-Find operations (`find` and `union`) have nearly constant time complexity, especially with path compression and union by rank.
- **Union Operations:** Almost `O(1)` due to path compression.
- **Find Operations:** Almost `O(1)` due to path compression.
- **Overall Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of equations.

This efficient approach ensures that we handle up to 500 equations swiftly while ensuring correctness by leveraging the properties of the Union-Find data structure.
