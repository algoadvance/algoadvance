title:  Minimum Cost to Cut a Stick-out
permalink: /s1547
---

Given a wooden stick of length `n` units and an array `cuts` where `cuts[i]` represents a position at which you should perform a cut, find the minimum total cost to perform all cuts. You can assume that the initial stick has a length of `n` units and all the positions in the `cuts` array are unique integers between `1` and `n-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can cuts be performed in any order?**
   - Yes, the cuts can be performed in any order.

2. **What is the cost of performing a cut?**
   - The cost of performing a cut is equal to the length of the stick being cut at that time.

3. **Is the array `cuts` sorted?**
   - No, the array `cuts` is not necessarily sorted.

4. **Are there any constraints on the values of `n` and the length of cuts?**
   - Yes, typically constraints are `1 <= n <= 10^6` and `1 <= cuts.length <= min(n-1, 100)`.

### Strategy

1. **Problem Insight:**
   - This is a classic dynamic programming problem where you need to minimize the cost of multiple operations on subproblems.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Introduce an auxiliary array `cuts_with_ends` which includes the start and end points of the stick `[0]` and `[n]`.
   - Sort the `cuts_with_ends` array.
   - Define `dp[i][j]` as the minimum cost to cut the stick between cuts at indices `i` and `j` in `cuts_with_ends`.
   - The cost to cut a segment of the stick is given by the difference between the boundaries of the segment.
   - Use a bottom-up approach to fill the `dp` table.

3. **Recurrence Relation:**
   - For each segment defined by `(i, j)`, you need to try making a cut at every possible cut point `k` within `(i, j)` and take the minimum of those.

### Code

```python
def minCost(n, cuts):
    # Add the two ends and sort the cuts array
    cuts = sorted(cuts + [0, n])
    length = len(cuts)
    
    # Initialize dp table
    dp = [[0] * length for _ in range(length)]
    
    # Iterate over the lengths of the segments
    for l in range(2, length):  # no cuts
        # l is the distance between i and j
        for i in range(length - l):
            j = i + l
            dp[i][j] = float('inf')
            for k in range(i + 1, j):
                dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + cuts[j] - cuts[i])
    
    return dp[0][length - 1]

# Example usage
n = 7
cuts = [1, 3, 4, 5]
print(minCost(n, cuts))  # Output: 16
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(k^3)\) where \(k\) is the number of cuts. This is due to the three nested loops over \(i\), \(j\), and \(k\).
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(k^2)\) for the DP table.

Given the constraints, this approach should work efficiently within the given limits.
