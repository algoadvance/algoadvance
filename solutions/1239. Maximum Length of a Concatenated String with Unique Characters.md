title:  Maximum Length of a Concatenated String with Unique Characters-out
permalink: /s1239
---
Given an array of strings `arr`, you need to find the maximum possible length of a concatenated string such that all the characters of the concatenated string are unique.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Is it guaranteed that `arr` will not be empty?
   - What is the maximum length of individual strings in `arr`?
   - Are strings in `arr` composed of lowercase English letters only?

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - If no valid concatenation is possible (i.e., no strings with all unique characters can be formed), should the function return 0?

### Strategy
1. **Filtering**: First, filter out any string from the input array `arr` that contains duplicate characters because such strings can never be part of the final concatenation.
   
2. **Backtracking**: Use a backtracking approach to explore all possible concatenations of the filtered strings. At each step:
   - Choose a string.
   - If it doesn't have any characters in common with the currently formed concatenated string, add it to the concatenation.
   - Move on to the next string and repeat the process until no more strings can be added.

3. **State Representation**: 
   - Use a bitmask (binary representation) to efficiently keep track of which characters are in the current concatenation.

### Code
Here's the code implementing the above strategy:

```python
def maxLength(arr):
    def valid(s):
        return len(s) == len(set(s))
    
    def backtrack(pos, mask):
        nonlocal max_len
        max_len = max(max_len, bin(mask).count('1'))
        
        for i in range(pos, len(masks)):
            if not (mask & masks[i]):  # No common characters
                backtrack(i + 1, mask | masks[i])
    
    masks = []
    max_len = 0
    
    # Convert each string to a bitmask
    for s in arr:
        if valid(s):
            bitmask = 0
            for char in s:
                bitmask |= (1 << (ord(char) - ord('a')))
            masks.append(bitmask)
    
    # Start backtracking
    backtrack(0, 0)
    return max_len

# Example usage:
arr = ["un", "iq", "ue"]
print(maxLength(arr))  # Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity
- **Filtering Step**: Checking if the string has unique characters takes \(O(n \cdot k)\) where \(n\) is the number of strings in `arr` and \(k\) is the average length of a string.
- **Backtracking Step**: In the worst case, we explore \(2^n\) possible states (where \(n\) is the number of valid strings). Within each state, we perform bitwise operations which are \(O(1)\).
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is approximately \(O(n \cdot 2^n)\) in the worst case, where \(n\) is the number of strings in `arr`.

This approach ensures we find the maximum length of a concatenated string with unique characters by exploring all possible valid combinations efficiently using bit masks.
