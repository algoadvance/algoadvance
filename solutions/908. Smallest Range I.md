You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. For each element in the `nums` array, you can increase or decrease it by `k` at most once.

The objective is to minimize the difference between the maximum and minimum values of the array after performing at most one operation (+k or -k) on each element.

Return the smallest possible difference between the maximum and minimum values of the array after performing the mentioned operation.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the elements in the `nums` array distinct?**
   - Not necessarily. The elements in the array can be duplicate values.
2. **What are the constraints on `nums` and `k`?**
   - `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
   - `0 <= k <= 10^4`
   - `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
3. **Can `k` be zero?**
   - Yes, and if `k` is zero, the difference will naturally be the difference between the maximum and minimum of the original array.

### Strategy
1. **Observation**:
   - Increasing or decreasing each element by `k` will shift the possible range of values the elements can take.
   - Therefore, the new minimum value in the array can be `min(nums) - k` and the new maximum value can be `max(nums) + k`.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - To minimize the difference, we observe that by decreasing the highest value by `k` and increasing the lowest value by `k`, the potential range of the array can be tightened around the original mean.

### Formula:
- Original minimum = `min(nums)`
- Original maximum = `max(nums)`
- Possible new minimum = `min(nums) + k`
- Possible new maximum = `max(nums) - k`
- The smallest range after operations = `max(0, (max(nums) - k) - (min(nums) + k))`

### Code
Here's the implementation of the above strategy in Python.

```python
def smallestRangeI(nums, k):
    min_num = min(nums)
    max_num = max(nums)
    return max(0, (max_num - k) - (min_num + k))

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 3, 6]
k = 3
print(smallestRangeI(nums, k))  # Output: 0
```

### Time Complexity
- Calculating the minimum and maximum of the array takes `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`.
- The rest of the operations (subtraction and max calculations) take constant time `O(1)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is `O(n)`.
