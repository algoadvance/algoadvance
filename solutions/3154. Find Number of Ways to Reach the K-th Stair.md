title:  Find Number of Ways to Reach the K-th Stair-out
permalink: /s3154
---

You are given a staircase with `n` steps, and you are initially standing at the bottom step (step 0). Each time you can either climb 1 step, 2 steps, or 3 steps. Your task is to determine the number of distinct ways you can reach the `k`-th step (0-based index).

For instance, if `k = 3`, the ways to reach the 3rd step are:

1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
4. 3 steps

So, the answer should be 4 for `k = 3`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: What should be the value of the number of ways to reach the `0`-th step?
   - **A**: If you are standing already at the 0-th step, there is exactly 1 way (doing nothing).

2. **Q**: Are there any limitations on `k` or `n` values we need to consider for performance?
   - **A**: The solution should be efficient even for large values of `k`, potentially up to thousands.

3. **Q**: Can the number of steps at each move be customized or does it has to be 1, 2, or 3 steps?
   - **A**: According to the problem statement, you can only use 1, 2, or 3 steps at each move.

## Strategy

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. We create an array `dp` where `dp[i]` holds the number of ways to reach step `i`.

### Steps for Solution

1. **Base Cases**:
   - `dp[0] = 1`: There is one way to stay on the 0-th step (do nothing).

2. **Transition Relation**: 
   - For `i >= 1`: 
     - `dp[i] += dp[i - 1]` (coming from step `i-1`).
   - For `i >= 2`:
     - `dp[i] += dp[i - 2]` (coming from step `i-2`).
   - For `i >= 3`:
     - `dp[i] += dp[i - 3]` (coming from step `i-3`).

### Time Complexity

- **Time complexity**: O(k) - We need to compute the values for each step from 0 to k.
- **Space complexity**: O(k) - We need an array of size k+1 to store the intermediate results.

## Code

```python
def number_of_ways(k):
    # Base case check
    if k == 0:
        return 1
    
    # Initializing dp array
    dp = [0] * (k + 1)
    
    # Base case initialization
    dp[0] = 1  # only one way to stay at the ground step
    
    # Populate the dp array using the state transition
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        if i >= 1:
            dp[i] += dp[i - 1]
        if i >= 2:
            dp[i] += dp[i - 2]
        if i >= 3:
            dp[i] += dp[i - 3]
    
    # Result is stored in dp[k]
    return dp[k]

# Example Usage
k = 3
print(number_of_ways(k))  # Output: 4
```

This code reads well and follows the dynamic programming paradigm to solve the problem efficiently.
