title:  Maximize Area of Square Hole in Grid-out
permalink: /s2943

You are given a 2D grid of integers representing a matrix containing 0's and 1's. You are asked to find the side length of the largest square hole (a square sub-matrix consisting entirely of 0's) that can be carved out of this grid.

For example, given the following grid:
```
[
  [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
  [1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
  [1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
  [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
  [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]
]
```
The largest square hole would have a side length of 2.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Should the square hole be aligned with the grid or can it be rotated?
   - The square hole should be aligned with the grid.
2. Are there any constraints on the dimensions of the grid?
   - The grid can be of any size, but we can assume it fits within typical input constraints for a LeetCode problem.
3. Can I assume the input will always be valid (i.e., the grid only contains 0's and 1's)?
   - Yes, you can assume the input is always valid.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, a dynamic programming approach can be used. We will create a 2D `dp` array where `dp[i][j]` represents the side length of the largest square whose bottom-right corner is at cell `(i, j)`.

1. Initialize the `dp` array with the same dimensions as the grid, filled with zeros.
2. For each cell `(i, j)` in the grid:
   - If the cell contains a `0`, we calculate `dp[i][j]` as:
     ```python
     dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1])
     ```
     This formula works because if there's a `0` at `(i, j)`, the maximum square sub-matrix ending at that cell depends on the minimum size of squares ending at `(i-1, j)`, `(i, j-1)`, and `(i-1, j-1)`.
3. Track the maximum value in the `dp` array, which represents the side length of the largest square hole.
4. Return the side length of the largest square hole.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid.
- The space complexity is also `O(m * n)` due to the additional `dp` array.

## Code

```python
def largestSquareHole(grid):
    if not grid:
        return 0
    
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    dp = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    max_side_length = 0
    
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            if grid[i][j] == 0:
                if i == 0 or j == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = 1 + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1])
                max_side_length = max(max_side_length, dp[i][j])
    
    return max_side_length

# Example usage:
grid = [
    [1, 0, 1, 0, 0],
    [1, 0, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 1, 0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]
]
print(largestSquareHole(grid))  # Output: 2
```

This solution leverages dynamic programming to compute the size of the largest square hole efficiently, ensuring that each cell is processed exactly once.
