title:  Construct the Longest New String-out
permalink: /s2745
---

You are tasked with constructing the longest possible new string using three types of characters: 'a', 'b', and 'c' with certain constraints. You are given three integer inputs: 
- `a_count`, `b_count`, and `c_count` which denote the number of each character you can use.

The new string should follow these rules:
1. The string can only contain the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
2. You can use at most `a_count` of the character 'a', `b_count` of the character 'b', and `c_count` of the character 'c'.
3. The string should be maximized in length under the constraints given.

Your task is to calculate the longest length of the new string you can produce under these constraints.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is there any specific ordering required for the characters in the string?**
   - There are no constraints on the ordering of characters in the final string.

2. **Can characters be repeated consecutively without limits?**
   - No additional constraints on the repetition of characters is given.

3. **Are there any special characters or only lowercase 'a', 'b', and 'c'?**
   - Only lowercase 'a', 'b', and 'c' as specified.

With the given conditions, the objective is straightforward: construct the longest possible string using the maximum available characters.

## Strategy

1. **Initialize the string length to 0.**
2. **Iterate over the number of available characters and sum them up to compute the total length.**

This problem does not require complex algorithms since the constraints are straightforward. The goal is to simply sum up the available characters.

## Code

Here's a Python implementation to solve this problem:

```python
def longestString(a_count, b_count, c_count):
    # Sum all counts since there are no additional constraints on ordering
    return a_count + b_count + c_count

# Example usage
a_count = 5
b_count = 10
c_count = 15

print(longestString(a_count, b_count, c_count))  # Output should be 30
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(1)` because it involves a constant-time summation of three integers. The space complexity is also `O(1)` since no additional space is used beyond a few variables.

This solution achieves the objective efficiently given the constraints provided.
