title:  Random Pick with Weight-out
permalink: /s528
---
You are given an array `w` of positive integers, where `w[i]` describes the weight of index `i`.

Write a function `pickIndex` which randomly picks an index in proportion to its weight.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the weights guaranteed to be positive integers?**
   - Yes, each weight is a positive integer.
2. **Can weights be zero?**
   - No, weights are positive integers as specified.
3. **Are we going to have multiple `pickIndex` calls after initializing with the array `w`?**
   - Yes, the function `pickIndex` may be called multiple times.

## Strategy
The problem can be broken down into two main parts:
1. **Preprocessing**: Before we start picking indices, we will preprocess the weights to accumulate the probabilities.
2. **Random Picking**: For each pick, we will use the accumulated weights to determine which index to pick in proportion to its weight.

### Preprocessing
We'll calculate a prefix sum of the weights. This will allow us to use binary search to quickly determine the correct index for a given pick.

### Random Picking
To pick an index, we:
1. Generate a random number between 1 and the total sum of the weights.
2. Use binary search to find the target index in the prefix sum array.

### Steps:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a prefix sum array from the input weights.
   
2. **Picking an Index**:
   - Generate a random integer in the range from 1 to the total sum of weights.
   - Use binary search (`bisect` in Python) to find the first prefix sum that is greater than or equal to the random number.

### Time Complexity
- **Preprocessing**: O(N), where N is the number of weights.
- **Picking**: O(log N) due to the binary search.

## Code

```python
import random
import bisect

class Solution:
    def __init__(self, w):
        self.prefix_sums = []
        self.total_sum = 0
        
        for weight in w:
            self.total_sum += weight
            self.prefix_sums.append(self.total_sum)

    def pickIndex(self):
        target = random.randint(1, self.total_sum)
        index = bisect.bisect_left(self.prefix_sums, target)
        return index
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization (`__init__` method)**:
  - `self.prefix_sums` stores the accumulated sums of weights. For example, if `w = [1, 3, 2]`, the `prefix_sums` will be `[1, 4, 6]`.
  - `self.total_sum` is the total of all weights; here it would be `6`.
  
- **Pick an Index (`pickIndex` method)**:
  - Generate a random integer between `1` and `self.total_sum`. This corresponds to randomly selecting a point on the cumulative weight scale.
  - Use `bisect.bisect_left` to find the first index in the `prefix_sums` where the cumulative sum is greater than or equal to the random number.

This approach ensures that indices with larger weights have a proportionally higher chance of being picked, as required by the problem statement.
