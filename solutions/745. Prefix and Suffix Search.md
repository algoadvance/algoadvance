title:  Prefix and Suffix Search-out

Design a special dictionary with some words that searches the words in it by a prefix and a suffix.

Implement the `WordFilter` class:

- `WordFilter(string[] words)` Initializes the object with the words in the dictionary.
- `f(string prefix, string suffix) string` Returns the index of the word in the dictionary that has the prefix `prefix` and the suffix `suffix`. If there is more than one valid index, return the largest of them. If there is no such index, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - How long can the words in the dictionary be?
    - How many words can be in the dictionary?
    - Are the words expected to be lowercase?

2. **Output:**
    - Should we return the index as a string or an integer?

### Strategy

To efficiently find the word with the given prefix and suffix, we need a strategy that avoids scanning the entire list of words for each query. 

1. **Create a Combined Key for Quick Lookup:**
    - Store each word in a dictionary in such a way that keys are combinations of possible prefixes and suffixes.
    - This would allow us to quickly check for any prefix-suffix combination.

2. **Dictionary Construction:**
    - For each word, generate all possible prefix and suffix combinations and store them in a dictionary along with their indices.
    - Example: for the word "apple", store entries for "a..e", "ap..le", and so on.

3. **Searching:**
    - Use the combined key approach for searching, which directly points to the precomputed list of possible indices.

### Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class WordFilter:
    def __init__(self, words):
        self.prefix_suffix_map = defaultdict(list)
        
        # Iterate through each word and its index
        for index, word in enumerate(words):
            length = len(word)
            # Create all possible prefix and suffix combinations
            for i in range(length + 1):
                prefix = word[:i]
                for j in range(length + 1):
                    suffix = word[j:]
                    # Store both prefix and suffix as combined key
                    self.prefix_suffix_map[(prefix, suffix)].append(index)

    def f(self, prefix, suffix):
        if (prefix, suffix) in self.prefix_suffix_map:
            # Return the largest index for prefix-suffix combination
            return max(self.prefix_suffix_map[(prefix, suffix)])
        return -1

# Example Usage:
words = ["apple"]
word_filter = WordFilter(words)
print(word_filter.f("a", "e"))  # Output: 0
print(word_filter.f("b", ""))   # Output: -1
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization (`__init__`):**
    - Generating all prefix-suffix pairs for each word is `O(L^2)` where `L` is the length of the word. Doing this for `N` words results in `O(N * L^2)`.
- **Query (`f`):**
    - Looking up the prefix-suffix pair in the dictionary is `O(1)` on average due to hash map lookups.

Thus, the overall complexity is:

- **Space Complexity:**
    - O(N * L^2) for storing all combinations in the dictionary.
- **Time Complexity:**
    - `O(N * L^2)` for initialization.
    - `O(1)` for each query.
