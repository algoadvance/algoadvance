title:  Number of Ways to Arrive at Destination-out
permalink: /s1976
---

You are in a city with `n` intersections numbered from `0` to `n-1` and `m` roads labeled from `0` to `m-1`. You are given an integer `n` and a 2D array `roads` where `roads[i] = [u_i, v_i, time_i]` indicates that there is a directed road from intersection `u_i` to intersection `v_i` that takes `time_i` minutes to travel. You are also given two intersections `start` and `end`, and you are to find the number of ways to arrive at `end` from `start` in the shortest amount of time.

Return the number of ways to arrive at the destination modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the graph directed or undirected?**  
   The given problem statement implies undirected roads.

2. **Can the roads contain cycles?**  
   Yes, the graph can contain cycles.

3. **Can there be multiple roads between the same intersections?**  
   Consider the roads unique between pairs of intersections for this problem.

4. **What should we return if there is no valid path?**
   In such a case, the number of ways to arrive at the destination would be `0`.

### Strategy

We can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the `start` intersection to the `end` intersection. While doing so, we will keep track of the number of ways to reach each node using the shortest path.

1. **Data Structures:**  
   - Use a priority queue (min-heap) to store nodes and their corresponding shortest path times.
   - Use an array `dist` to store the shortest known distance from the `start` to each node.
   - Use an array `ways` to store the number of ways to reach each node using the shortest known path.

2. **Algorithm:**
   - Initialize `dist[start]` to 0 and `ways[start]` to 1, as there's only one way to stay at the starting point.
   - Use a priority queue to process nodes based on their current shortest known distance.
   - For each node, explore its neighbors and update their shortest path and number of ways accordingly.
   - If a shorter path to a neighbor is found, update its distance and reset ways count.
   - If another shortest path to a neighbor is found (same distance), add the count of ways to the neighbor.

3. **Termination:**
   - The process continues until the priority queue is empty.
   - The result will be available in `ways[end]`.

### Code

```python
import heapq
from collections import defaultdict
from sys import maxsize

def countPaths(n, roads, start, end):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7

    # Build the graph
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v, time in roads:
        graph[u].append((v, time))
        graph[v].append((u, time))
    
    # Min-heap priority queue
    pq = [(0, start)]  # (distance, node)
    
    # Distance and ways arrays
    dist = [maxsize] * n
    ways = [0] * n
    dist[start] = 0
    ways[start] = 1
    
    while pq:
        time, node = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        if time > dist[node]:
            continue
        
        for neighbor, travel_time in graph[node]:
            new_time = time + travel_time
            
            if new_time < dist[neighbor]:
                dist[neighbor] = new_time
                ways[neighbor] = ways[node]
                heapq.heappush(pq, (new_time, neighbor))
            elif new_time == dist[neighbor]:
                ways[neighbor] = (ways[neighbor] + ways[node]) % MOD
    
    return ways[end]

# Example usage:
n = 7
roads = [[0, 6, 7], [0, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 3], [6, 3, 3], 
         [3, 5, 1], [6, 5, 1], [2, 5, 1], [0, 4, 5], [4, 6, 2]]
start = 0
end = 6
print(countPaths(n, roads, start, end))  # Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the algorithm is `O((n + m) log n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes and `m` is the number of edges. This is because we process each node and each edge in the graph, and the heap operations take `O(log n)` time.

The space complexity is `O(n + m)` due to storing the graph, distances, and ways arrays.
