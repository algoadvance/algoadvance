title:  Find the Student that Will Replace the Chalk-out
permalink: /s1894

You are given an array `chalk` and an integer `k`. The array `chalk` represents the amount of chalk each student will use in order. The students will replace the chalk once the chalk runs out. The problem is to find the index of the student who will replace the chalk after they cannot satisfactorily use the remaining pieces of chalk for depicting their usage.

### Function Signature
```python
def chalkReplacer(chalk: List[int], k: int) -> int:
```

### Example

- Example 1:
    ```python
    chalk = [5,1,5]
    k = 22
    Output: 0
    ```
    Explanation: The students go through the chalk array for a total of 22 units. By the time they run out of chalk at 22 units, the index is 0 since the first student will not have enough chalk to use on their next turn.

- Example 2:
    ```python
    chalk = [3,4,1,2]
    k = 25
    Output: 1
    ```
    Explanation: The students go through the chalk array for a total of 25 units. By the time they run out of chalk at 25 units, the index is 1 since the second student will not have enough chalk to depict their usage on their subsequent turn.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can `chalk` array be empty?
2. Will `k` always be a positive integer?
3. Can we assume that the array `chalk` will always contain positive integers?

## Strategy

To find the student who will replace the chalk, we can use the following approach:

1. **Calculate the total sum of chalk usage**:
    - Find the sum of all elements in the `chalk` array (`total_chalk`).

2. **Reduce k using mod operation**:
    - Since the students repeat their chalk usage in a cyclic manner, we can reduce `k` by taking it modulo the total chalk usage. This simplifies the problem by reducing the number of cycles.

3. **Find the student who will replace the chalk**:
    - Iterate through the `chalk` array and decrement `k` by the chalk used by each student. If at any point `k` becomes less than the chalk needed by a student, return that student's index.

### Code

```python
from typing import List

def chalkReplacer(chalk: List[int], k: int) -> int:
    # Calculate the total chalk usage
    total_chalk = sum(chalk)
    
    # Reduce k by the total chalk usage modulo
    k %= total_chalk
    
    # Find the student who runs out of chalk
    for i in range(len(chalk)):
        if k < chalk[i]:
            return i
        k -= chalk[i]
    
    # This point should never be reached due to the problem constraints
    return -1
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The overall time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `chalk` array. This is because we calculate the sum of the array and also iterate through the array at most twice.
  
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the student who will replace the chalk with linear time complexity.
