title:  Minimum Number of Increments on Subarrays to Form a Target Array-out
permalink: /s1526
---

You are given an integer array `target`. You start with an integer array `arr` of the same length with all elements set to 0, and you can perform the following operation as many times as you want:

- Choose any subarray from `arr` and increment each value in the subarray by 1.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to form `target` array from `arr`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints**:
   - Is the length of `target` constrained?
   - What are the value ranges for elements within `target`?
   - Can `target` contain negative numbers?
   - Are there any performance constraints we should be mindful of?

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - What should be returned if `target` is already all zeros?
   - How should single element arrays be handled?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, the goal is to determine the minimum number of increment operations needed. Here is an effective approach:

1. **Observation**:
    - To transform `arr` (initially all zeros) to `target`, we must perform increments on subarrays.
    - To convert `arr` to `target`, the minimum number of increments required is driven by the diff `target[i] - target[i-1]` whenever `target[i] > target[i-1]`.

2. **Detailed Steps**:
    - Iterate through the `target` array.
    - Count the number of increments needed when transitioning from `target[i-1]` to `target[i]` when `target[i]` is greater than `target[i-1]`.

3. **Key Insight**:
    - The number of operations required to achieve the target is the sum of all positive differences between consecutive elements in the `target` array.

### Time Complexity

This algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the `target` array since we need to check each element once.

### Code

```python
def minNumberOperations(target):
    operations = 0
    prev = 0
    
    for num in target:
        if num > prev:
            operations += (num - prev)
        prev = num
        
    return operations

# Example Usage
target = [1,2,3,2,1]
print(minNumberOperations(target))  # Output: 3
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: 
    - Start with `operations` set to 0, which will accumulate the required operations.
    - `prev` is initialized to 0, representing the value before the first element.

2. **Iteration**:
    - For each number in `target`, check if it is greater than `prev`.
    - If it is, the difference `(num - prev)` is added to `operations`.
    - Update `prev` to be the current `num`.

3. **Result**:
    - The variable `operations` will then contain the minimum number of increments needed to form the `target` array.

This approach efficiently computes the desired output using a simple traversal and difference calculation.
