title:  Binary Subarrays With Sum-out
permalink: /s930
---

Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `goal`, return the number of non-empty subarrays with a sum equal to `goal`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,0,1], goal = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: The 4 subarrays are bolded and underlined below:
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
[1,0,1,0,1]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [0,0,0,0,0], goal = 0
Output: 15
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.
- `0 <= goal <= nums.length`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can we assume that `nums` is always a valid binary array?  
   **A:** Yes, `nums` will be a valid binary array as per the problem statement.

2. **Q:** What should be returned if no subarrays meet the requirement?  
   **A:** The function should return `0`.

3. **Q:** Are there potential performance concerns given a large input size?  
   **A:** Yes, and we need to optimize our solution to handle arrays up to \(3 \times 10^4\) elements efficiently.

### Strategy

To efficiently solve this problem, we can use the "prefix sum + hashmap" approach:

1. **Prefix Sum:** This technique helps to compute the sum of subarrays more efficiently. 
2. **Hashmap:** We will use a hashmap (or dictionary) to store the frequency of prefix sums that we have encountered so far.

**Steps:**

1. Initialize a hashmap (`prefix_sums`) to store the count of prefix sums, and initialize the count for prefix sum `0` as 1.
2. Initialize variables for the current sum (`current_sum`) and the count of subarrays (`count`).
3. Traverse through the `nums` array.
   - For each element, update the `current_sum`.
   - Check if `current_sum - goal` exists in the hashmap. If it exists, increment the `count` by the frequency of `current_sum - goal`.
   - Update the hashmap with the `current_sum`.
4. Return the `count`.

### Code

```python
def numSubarraysWithSum(nums, goal):
    from collections import defaultdict

    prefix_sums = defaultdict(int)
    prefix_sums[0] = 1
    current_sum = 0
    count = 0
    
    for num in nums:
        current_sum += num
        
        if current_sum - goal in prefix_sums:
            count += prefix_sums[current_sum - goal]
        
        prefix_sums[current_sum] += 1
    
    return count
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array. This is because we are traversing through the array once.
2. **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is \(O(n)\) in the worst case, due to the storage in the hashmap.

This solution ensures efficient handling of large input sizes with optimal performance.
