title:  Minimum Time Visiting All Points-out
permalink: /s1266
---

Given an array of `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the 2D plane, return the minimum time in seconds to visit all the points in the order given by `points`.

You can move one unit distance in either the x-direction, y-direction, or diagonally (in both x and y direction).

### Example
1. **Input:** `points = [[1,1],[3,4],[-1,0]]`
   **Output:** 7
   **Explanation:** 
    - From (1,1) to (3,4), we can move 2 units diagonally to (3,3) and 1 unit to (3,4). Total = 3.
    - From (3,4) to (-1,0) we can move 4 units left to (-1,4) and 4 units down to (-1,0). Total = 4.
    - Therefore total time = 3 + 4 = 7.

2. **Input:** `points = [[3,2],[-2,2]]`
   **Output:** 5
   **Explanation:** 
    - From (3,2) to (-2,2), we need to move 5 units left.

### Constraints:
- `points.length` >= 1
- `points[i].length` == 2
- `-1000 <= xi, yi <= 1000`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can we assume that the points are distinct?
   **A:** Yes, you can assume that each point is unique.
2. **Q:** Can the points array be empty?
   **A:** No, `points.length` >= 1 as per the constraints.

## Strategy
1. Calculate the distance to travel between two consecutive points.
2. The distance is determined by the max of the absolute difference of x-coordinates and y-coordinates because you can move diagonally.
   - For example, to move from `(xi, yi)` to `(xf, yf)`, the minimum time would be `max(abs(xf - xi), abs(yf - yi))`.

## Code
```python
def minTimeToVisitAllPoints(points):
    total_time = 0
    
    for i in range(1, len(points)):
        x0, y0 = points[i - 1]
        x1, y1 = points[i]
        
        time_to_next_point = max(abs(x1 - x0), abs(y1 - y0))
        total_time += time_to_next_point
    
    return total_time

# Test cases
print(minTimeToVisitAllPoints([[1, 1], [3, 4], [-1, 0]]))  # Output: 7
print(minTimeToVisitAllPoints([[3, 2], [-2, 2]]))  # Output: 5
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity for this solution is O(n), where `n` is the number of points in the input list. This is because we iterate through the points exactly once.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
