title:  Kth Ancestor of a Tree Node-out
permalink: /s1483
---

Given a tree with `n` nodes, each node is labeled from `0` to `n-1`. The tree is represented as follows:
- There is a parent array where `parent[i]` is the parent of node `i`.
- `parent[0] = -1` since node `0` is the root of the tree.

You are asked to complete a function to find the k-th ancestor of a given node. Specifically, you need to implement a `TreeAncestor` class:

- `TreeAncestor(int n, int[] parent)` Initializes the object with a tree consisting of `n` nodes and the parent array.
- `int getKthAncestor(int node, int k)` Returns the k-th ancestor of the given node. If there is no such ancestor, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the values of `n` and `k`?**
   - Yes, typically `n` will not exceed `10^5` and `k` will also stay within this range or the tree height.

2. **Do we need to handle any edge cases, such as non-existent nodes or negative `k` values?**
   - Assuming `k` and `node` will always be valid within the bounds specified in the prompt.

3. **Is the tree guaranteed to be connected and acyclic?**
   - Yes, it is a valid tree structure.

### Strategy

The problem involves moving up the ancestor chain efficiently. Since repeated traversal for each query could be inefficient, we can use dynamic programming (binary lifting) to preprocess the tree ancestors and allow quick lookups.

**Steps:**
1. **Preprocessing using Binary Lifting:**
   - Precompute a `dp` table where `dp[i][j]` represents the (2^j)-th ancestor of node `i`.
   
2. **Binary Lifting Table Construction:**
   - Initialize `dp[node][j]` for each node and jump.
   - If `dp[node][j-1]` is valid, set `dp[node][j]` to `dp[dp[node][j-1]][j-1]`.
   
3. **Querying k-th Ancestor:**
   - To find the k-th ancestor of a node, decompose `k` into powers of 2 and use the `dp` table to jump accordingly.

**Time Complexity:**
1. Preprocessing takes `O(n log n)` time.
2. Each query takes `O(log k)` time.
3. Space complexity is `O(n log n)` due to the dp table.

### Code

```python
class TreeAncestor:

    def __init__(self, n: int, parent: List[int]):
        self.LOG = 17  # As n <= 10^5, log2(10^5) is approximately 17
        self.dp = [[-1] * self.LOG for _ in range(n)]
        
        # Initialize the 1st ancestor
        for i in range(n):
            self.dp[i][0] = parent[i]
        
        # Populate the DP table
        for j in range(1, self.LOG):
            for i in range(n):
                if self.dp[i][j-1] != -1:
                    self.dp[i][j] = self.dp[self.dp[i][j-1]][j-1]
                else:
                    self.dp[i][j] = -1

    def getKthAncestor(self, node: int, k: int) -> int:
        # Move up the ancestor tree until k becomes 0 or node becomes -1
        for j in range(self.LOG):
            if k & (1 << j):
                node = self.dp[node][j]
                if node == -1:
                    break
        return node

# Example usage:
# parent = [-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2, 2]
# tree = TreeAncestor(7, parent)
# print(tree.getKthAncestor(3, 1))  # Output: 1
# print(tree.getKthAncestor(5, 2))  # Output: 0
# print(tree.getKthAncestor(6, 3))  # Output: -1
```

This approach ensures efficient preprocessing and query handling to find k-th ancestors effectively.
