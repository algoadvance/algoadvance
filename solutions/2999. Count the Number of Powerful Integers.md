title:  Count the Number of Powerful Integers-out
permalink: /s2999

Given three integers `x`, `y`, and `bound`, return a list of all powerful integers that have a value less than or equal to `bound`.

A powerful integer is an integer that can be expressed as `x^i + y^j` for some integers `i >= 0` and `j >= 0`.

You may return the answer in any order. The answer is guaranteed to be unique.

### Example:

```python
Input: x = 3, y = 5, bound = 15
Output: [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 14]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of x, y, and bound**: What are the possible ranges for the integers x, y, and bound?
   - Typically: x >= 1, y >= 1, bound >= 1.

2. **Handling large powers**: Should we consider integers for i and j such that x^i or y^j are within bound, or should we handle overflow differently?
   - We can limit the computation to cases where x^i and y^j <= bound.

3. **Return format**: Do we need to return the output in a specific order?
   - No, the answer can be in any order as stated in the problem.

## Strategy

1. **Iterate over all possible powers**:
   - We'll iterate `i` such that `x^i <= bound`.
   - For each `i`, iterate `j` such that `y^j <= bound`.
  
2. **Calculate the sum**: Calculate `x^i + y^j` and check if it is within the bound.
   - If yes, add to the set of powerful integers.

3. **Stop Condition**: We should stop the iterations when powers of `x` or `y` exceed bound to avoid unnecessary computations.
   - If `x` or `y` equals 1, limit the loop to ensure we do not run into an infinite loop.

4. **Use a set**: To maintain uniqueness, store results in a set.

5. **Convert to List**: Finally, convert the set to a list and return.

## Code

```python
def powerfulIntegers(x, y, bound):
    powerful_set = set()
    
    i = 0
    while x**i <= bound:
        j = 0
        while y**j <= bound:
            value = x**i + y**j
            if value <= bound:
                powerful_set.add(value)
            else:
                break

            if y == 1:  # To prevent infinite loop if y is 1
                break
            j += 1
        
        if x == 1: # To prevent infinite loop if x is 1
            break
        i += 1

    return list(powerful_set)

# Example Usage
x = 3
y = 5
bound = 15
print(powerfulIntegers(x, y, bound))
```

## Time Complexity

- The total number of computations is `O((log bound) * (log bound))`, where `log bound` is the number of iterations needed for both x and y powers to be less than or equal to bound.
- In practice, this works efficiently due to the finite upper bound on realistic inputs provided by constraints.

This solution ensures efficiency while covering all possible edge cases like handling `x` or `y` as 1 to avoid infinite loops and ensuring all powerful integers within the given bound are considered.
