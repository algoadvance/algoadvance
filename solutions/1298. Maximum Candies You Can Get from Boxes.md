title:  Maximum Candies You Can Get from Boxes-out
permalink: /s1298
---
You have `n` boxes in a warehouse, and you are given four arrays: `status`, `candies`, `keys`, and `containedBoxes`. 
- `status[i]` is 1 if the `i-th` box is open and 0 if it is closed.
- `candies[i]` is the number of candies in the `i-th` box.
- `keys[i]` is an array containing the indices of the boxes that the `i-th` box can unlock.
- `containedBoxes[i]` is an array containing the indices of the boxes that are contained in the `i-th` box.

You start with some initial boxes given in the initial list `initialBoxes`. You can take above operations as long as there are boxes to be opened:
1. If the box is open, collect all the candies in it.
2. If the box is closed, and you have the key for it, open it.

Return the maximum number of candies you can collect.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be done if a box has already been opened?**
    - Collect the candies only once and keep track of opened boxes to avoid duplicate actions.
2. **What should be the behavior if a box appears in both `initialBoxes` and `containedBoxes`?**
    - Process it based on the sequence of operations: start from initial boxes, open and collect candies if possible, and then process contained boxes if found.

## Strategy
1. Use a queue for breadth-first traversal of the boxes.
2. Use sets to track opened boxes, collected candies, and obtained keys for efficient lookups.
3. Start with `initialBoxes` and process each box:
   - If the box is open and not yet processed, collect the candies and add any contained boxes and keys to the respective sets.
   - Open any newly available boxes when the corresponding keys are found.
4. Continue until there are no more boxes to process in the queue.
5. Sum up and return the collected candies.

## Code

```python
from collections import deque

def maxCandies(status, candies, keys, containedBoxes, initialBoxes):
    # Use a deque for BFS
    queue = deque(initialBoxes)
    
    # Sets to track opened boxes, obtained keys, and collected candies
    collected = set()
    obtained_keys = set()
    visited = set()
    
    total_candies = 0
    
    while queue:
        current_box = queue.popleft()
        
        if current_box in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(current_box)
        
        # If the box is open or if we have the key for the box
        if status[current_box] == 1 or current_box in obtained_keys:
            # Collect the candies from the current box
            total_candies += candies[current_box]
            
            # Mark the box as processed
            collected.add(current_box)
            
            # Add contained boxes to the queue
            for box in containedBoxes[current_box]:
                if box not in visited:
                    queue.append(box)
                    
            # Add any keys found in the current box to obtained_keys
            for key in keys[current_box]:
                if key not in obtained_keys:
                    obtained_keys.add(key)
                    
                    # If we have a key for a box that hasn't been processed yet, add it to the queue
                    if key not in collected:
                        queue.append(key)
    
    return total_candies

# Example usage:
status = [1,0,1,0]
candies = [7,5,4,100]
keys = [[],[],[1],[]]
containedBoxes = [[1,2],[3],[],[]]
initialBoxes = [0]

print(maxCandies(status, candies, keys, containedBoxes, initialBoxes))  # Output: 16
```

## Time Complexity
- **Initialization:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of boxes.
- **BFS Traversal:** Each box is processed once, yielding \(O(n)\) operations.
- **Total:** \(O(n)\), efficient for large input sizes.

This ensures that we handle each box operation exactly once and avoid redundant processing by using sets and a queue effectively.
