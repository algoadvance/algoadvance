Leetcode Problem 1441: *Build an Array With Stack Operations*

Given an array `target` and an integer `n`. In each step, you have a stack, and you may perform the following three operations:

1. "Push": Push an integer onto the stack.
2. "Pop": Remove the most recent integer pushed onto the stack.
3. "Done": Stop operation.

You need to use the operations "Push" and "Pop" to build the array `target` from an array of the first `n` positive integers `[1, 2, ..., n]`.

Return the list of operations that builds the array `target` from `1` to `n`. If that is impossible, return an empty list.

**Example:**
```python
Input: target = [1,3], n = 3
Output: ["Push","Push","Pop","Push"]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for `n`?**
   - Usually, `n` is a reasonable integer, likely to fit within typical constraints for programming contests, e.g., up to 100 or 1000.

2. **Are the elements in `target` guaranteed to be strictly in increasing order?**
   - Yes, each number in `target` is unique and in increasing order.

3. **Do we have to build the output exactly in the same order as `target`?**
   - Yes, the operations need to result in the `target` array in the correct order.

### Strategy

To solve the problem:

1. Initialize an empty list `result` to store the operations.
2. Initialize a variable `current` to store the current number to be pushed (starting from 1).
3. Iterate over each number `num` in `target`:
   - For every number from `current` to `num`:
     - Append "Push" to `result`.
     - If the current number is not `num`, append "Pop" to `result`.
   - Increment `current` to the next number after `num` (since we want to start from the next number onward).

### Code

Below is the implementation of the described strategy:

```python
def buildArray(target, n):
    result = []
    current = 1
    
    for num in target:
        while current < num:
            result.append("Push")
            result.append("Pop")
            current += 1
        result.append("Push")
        current += 1  # Move to the next number after pushing `num`
        
    return result

# Example usage
target = [1,3]
n = 3
print(buildArray(target, n))  # Output: ["Push", "Push", "Pop", "Push"]
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(m + k), where:

- `m` is the length of the `target` array.
- `k` is the count of additional "Push" and "Pop" operations needed when the numbers from 1 to n are not in `target`.

This complexity is reasonable given the constraints.
