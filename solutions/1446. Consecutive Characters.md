Given a string `s`, the task is to find the length of the longest contiguous substring of the same character.

**Example:**
- Input: `s = "abbcccddddeeeeedcba"`
- Output: `5`

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 500`
- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Is the string guaranteed to contain only lowercase English letters?
   - Yes, as per constraints.
2. Is the input string allowed to be empty?
   - No, the minimum length is 1.

No further clarifications needed. Let's proceed to the solution strategy.

## Strategy
To find the length of the longest contiguous substring of the same character, we can maintain a counter that tracks the length of the current contiguous substring and another counter for the maximum length found so far:

1. Initialize `max_length` to 1 (since the minimum length is 1).
2. Initialize `current_length` to 1 for the first character.
3. Iterate over the string starting from the second character:
   - If the current character is the same as the previous one, increment `current_length`.
   - If it is different, compare `current_length` with `max_length` and update `max_length` if necessary, then reset `current_length` to 1.
4. After the loop ends, compare `current_length` one last time with `max_length`.
5. Return `max_length`.

## Code

```python
def maxPower(s: str) -> int:
    if not s:
        return 0

    max_length = 1
    current_length = 1

    for i in range(1, s.length):
        if s[i] == s[i - 1]:
            current_length += 1
        else:
            max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
            current_length = 1

    max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
    return max_length

# Example usage
s = "abbcccddddeeeeedcba"
print(maxPower(s))  # Output is 5
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. We iterate through the string once, making the solution efficient. The space complexity is O(1) as we use a constant amount of extra space.
