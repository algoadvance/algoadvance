title:  Subarray Sum Equals K-out
permalink: /s560
---

You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. Your task is to find the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals to `k`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1], k = 2
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], k = 3
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`
- `-10^7 <= k <= 10^7`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input array contain negative numbers?**
   Yes, the array can contain negative numbers.
  
2. **Can the input array be empty?**
   No, the length of `nums` is at least 1 according to the constraints.

3. **Is there a maximum length to the input array?**
   Yes, the maximum length is `2 * 10^4`.
   
4. **Should the subarrays be contiguous?**
   Yes, the subarrays must be continuous.

### Strategy

To efficiently solve this problem, we can use a hashmap (dictionary) to store the cumulative sums (prefix sums) and their frequencies as we iterate through the array. The key idea is:
1. `current_sum` is the cumulative sum up to the current index.
2. If `current_sum - k` exists in the hashmap, it means there is a subarray ending at the current index which sums to `k`.

Here is the step-by-step approach:
1. Initialize `current_sum` to 0.
2. Initialize a hashmap `prefix_sums` to store the frequencies of cumulative sums. Initially, set `prefix_sums[0] = 1` because a sum of 0 means there's a subarray from the start that sums to `k`.
3. Iterate through the array, updating the `current_sum`.
4. For each element, check if `current_sum - k` is in `prefix_sums`. If it is, it means there are `prefix_sums[current_sum - k]` subarrays ending at this index which sum to `k`.
5. Update the hashmap with the new `current_sum`.

### Code

```python
def subarraySum(nums, k):
    count = 0
    current_sum = 0
    prefix_sums = {0: 1}
    
    for num in nums:
        current_sum += num
        
        # Check if there is a prefix sum that, when removed from current_sum, equals k
        if current_sum - k in prefix_sums:
            count += prefix_sums[current_sum - k]
        
        # Update the hashmap with the current sum
        if current_sum in prefix_sums:
            prefix_sums[current_sum] += 1
        else:
            prefix_sums[current_sum] = 1
    
    return count
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - We use a single pass to iterate through the `nums` array, and each operation (updating and checking in the hashmap) is O(1).
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - In the worst case, we store a cumulative sum for each element in the hashmap.

The above solution efficiently computes the total number of continuous subarrays whose sum equals `k` within optimal time and space constraints.
