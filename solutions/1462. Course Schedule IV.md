You are given a very large directed graph, represented as a list of `n` courses labeled from `0` to `n-1`, and a list of `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that course `ai` depends on course `bi` (bi must be taken before ai). Additionally, you are given a list of queries where `queries[i] = [ui, vi]` checks if you can take course `ui` after taking course `vi`.

You need to determine for each query if course `ui` can be taken after course `vi`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can there be multiple duplicate prerequisite entries?**
   - Assume no duplicates in the `prerequisites` list.

2. **Do we need to consider cycles in the graph?**
   - Assume there are no cycles in the graph (no prerequisites that make it impossible to complete the courses).

3. **What's the size of `n`, `prerequisites`, and `queries`?**
   - Assume `n` can be large (up to 1000), and `prerequisites` and `queries` lists can have up to `n * (n-1)` elements.

### Strategy

We can use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to compute the transitive closure of the graph. The algorithm efficiently checks if there's a path between any two nodes in a directed graph:

1. **Initialize a reachability matrix** `reachable` where `reachable[i][j]` is `True` if there is a direct or indirect path from course `i` to course `j`.
2. **Iterate** over each pair of nodes and update the reachability matrix according to the prerequisites.
3. **Use Floyd-Warshall** to update the reachability matrix for transitive closure.
4. **Answer each query** by looking up the reachability matrix.

### Code

```python
def checkIfPrerequisite(n, prerequisites, queries):
    # Initialize reachability matrix
    reachable = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Set direct prerequisites
    for u, v in prerequisites:
        reachable[u][v] = True
    
    # Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find transitive closure
    for k in range(n):
        for i in range(n):
            for j in range(n):
                if reachable[i][k] and reachable[k][j]:
                    reachable[i][j] = True
    
    # Answer queries using the reachability matrix
    result = []
    for u, v in queries:
        result.append(reachable[u][v])
    
    return result

# Example usage:
n = 4
prerequisites = [[0,1], [1,2], [2,3]]
queries = [[0,3], [3,0], [1,3], [3,1]]
print(checkIfPrerequisite(n, prerequisites, queries))  # Output: [True, False, True, False]
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution has three parts:
1. **Initialization:** Creating the reachability matrix is O(n^2).
2. **Setting prerequisites:** Populating it for direct prerequisites is O(p) where p is the number of prerequisites.
3. **Floyd-Warshall algorithm:** Running it is O(n^3) due to triple nested loops.
4. **Querying:** Each query lookup is O(1); thus, for `q` queries, it's O(q).

Overall, the dominant term is O(n^3), which makes this algorithm suitable for `n` up to around 1000.
