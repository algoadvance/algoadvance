title:  Maximize Palindrome Length From Subsequences-out
permalink: /s1771
---
You are given two strings, `word1` and `word2`. You want to construct a string in which either `word1` or `word2` is a subsequence. From the constructed string, you need to find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence. You can only reorder the characters in `word1` and `word2`.

Write a function:
```python
def longestPalindrome(word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are `word1` and `word2` non-empty strings?**
   Yes, both `word1` and `word2` are non-empty strings.

2. **What is the expected length of the strings?**
   The length of each string can go up to 1000 characters.

3. **Can the strings contain any characters other than lowercase alphabets?**
   No, the strings will contain only lowercase alphabets.

4. **Should the solution handle edge cases such as completely disjoint strings or strings that are already palindromes?**
   Yes, the solution should handle any valid input strings as per the problem constraints.

## Strategy
1. **Construct Palindromes**: We need to construct a palindrome by combining subsequences from `word1` and `word2`.
2. **Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**: Using Dynamic Programming (DP) to compute the length of the longest common subsequence which could help in finding the longest palindrome.
3. **DP Table for Longest Palindromic Subsequence**: Define a DP table to compute the longest palindromic subsequence that spans both `word1` and `word2`. 

Hereâ€™s the broad approach for the problem:
1. **Dynamic Programming Definitions**:
   - `dp[i][j]` will represent the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the string `word1 + word2`.
   - We'll build this DP table by considering substrings of increasing lengths and checking if the end characters can form a palindrome by checking previous results stored in the table.
2. **Combining Strings**: Concatenate `word1` and `word2` into a single string and use DP to find the longest palindromic subsequence within this combined string.

## Code

```python
def longestPalindrome(word1: str, word2: str) -> int:
    word = word1 + word2
    n = len(word)
    
    # Create a DP table
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    # Populate the DP table for single character palindromes
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i][i] = 1
    
    # Final result to return
    result = 0
    
    # Fill the DP table
    for length in range(2, n + 1):  # length of the substring
        for i in range(n - length + 1):
            j = i + length - 1
            if word[i] == word[j]:
                if i < len(word1) and j >= len(word1):
                    result = max(result, dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 2)
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 2
            else:
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])
    
    return result

# Example usage
word1 = "cacb"
word2 = "cbba"
print(longestPalindrome(word1, word2))  # Output should be the length of the longest palindromic subsequence
```

## Time Complexity
- **Space Complexity**: O(n^2) because of the DP table.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2) as we are filling an n x n DP table.

This solution should efficiently handle the input constraints as described in the problem.
