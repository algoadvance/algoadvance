title:  Palindrome Partitioning III-out
permalink: /s1278
---
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, find the minimum number of changes needed to divide the string into `k` non-empty palindromic substrings.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What are the length boundaries for the string `s`? (For example, is `1 <= len(s) <= 100`?)
    - What are the boundaries for `k`? (For example, is `1 <= k <= len(s)`?)

2. **Output Requirements**:
    - Should the function always return an integer, even if `k > len(s)`? Normally, this should return some invalidity signal.

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - How to handle cases when `s` is already a palindrome, or when `k = 1`?
    - Should we consider both uppercase and lowercase letters?

### Strategy
To solve this problem, follow these steps:

1. **Palindrome Cost Calculation**:
    - Create a helper function to compute the number of changes required to convert any substring `s[i:j+1]` into a palindrome.

2. **Dynamic Programming**:
    - Use a 2D DP array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of changes needed to divide the substring `s[0:i+1]` into `j` palindromic substrings.
    - Initialize: `dp[0][j] = 0` for all valid `j`, representing a single-character string (already a palindrome).
    - Transition: For each position `i` and partition count `j`, try to find the minimum changes by partitioning at different possible positions `p`.

3. **Optimize**:
    - Pre-compute the palindrome cost for every possible substring to avoid recalculating multiple times.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity mainly depends on the dynamic programming approach which might be O(n^3). However, sophisticated optimizations may reduce it. Letâ€™s see the implementation for clarity.

### Implementation

```python
def minChangesForPalindromeSubstring(s: str) -> list:
    n = len(s)
    cost = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    for length in range(2, n + 1):  # Substring lengths from 2 to n
        for i in range(n - length + 1):
            j = i + length - 1
            cost[i][j] = cost[i + 1][j - 1] + (0 if s[i] == s[j] else 1)
            
    return cost

def palindromePartition(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    n = len(s)
    if k == n:
        return 0  # each character is its own palindrome
    if k > n:
        return -1  # cannot partition into more parts than characters
    
    cost = minChangesForPalindromeSubstring(s)
    dp = [[float('inf')] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for i in range(n + 1):
        dp[i][0] = 0  # 0 partitions of empty string is 0 cost
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for part in range(1, k + 1):
            for p in range(i):
                dp[i][part] = min(dp[i][part], dp[p][part - 1] + cost[p][i - 1])
    
    return dp[n][k]

# Example usage:
s = "abc"
k = 2
print(palindromePartition(s, k))  # Expected output: 1
```

### Explanation:
1. **Cost Calculation**: `minChangesForPalindromeSubstring` calculates the required changes for each substring to become a palindrome.

2. **Dynamic Programming**: `dp` array is used to store the minimum changes required to partition the string `s[0:i+1]` into `j` palindromic parts.

3. **Initialization and Transition**: Proper initialization and state transitions ensure that we capture the minimum changes needed for every partition count up to `k`.

This approach ensures that all substrings and partition options are considered efficiently.
