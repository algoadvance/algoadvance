title:  Checking Existence of Edge Length Limited Paths-out
permalink: /s1697
---

This problem requires implementing a class to check the existence of edge length limited paths between given pairs of nodes in a graph.

You are given an `n`-node undirected graph, where each node is labeled from `0` to `n-1`. The graph is represented by a 2D integer array `edgeList`, where each `edgeList[i] = [u, v, dis]` denotes an edge between nodes `u` and `v` with a distance of `dis`.

Additionally, you are given an array `queries`, where each `queries[j] = [p, q, limit]`, and you need to answer whether there is a path from `p` to `q` such that every edge on the path has a distance strictly less than `limit`.

Implement a class `DistanceLimitedPathsExist`:

- `DistanceLimitedPathsExist(int n, int[][] edgeList)` Initializes the class with an `n`-node graph and the `edgeList`.
- `bool query(int p, int q, int limit)` Returns `true` if there is a path from `p` to `q` for which every edge has a distance strictly less than `limit`, otherwise returns `false`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can there be multiple edges between the same pair of nodes with different distances?
2. What is the range of `n` and the length of `edgeList`?
3. Are `p`, `q`, and the distances in `queries` guaranteed to be valid nodes and non-negative distances?

Let's proceed with the solution assuming the problem constraints are within a typical range for interview purposes.

## Strategy

We can use the Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU) data structure to handle the connectivity queries efficiently.

1. **Initialization**:
   - First, initialize a union-find data structure.
   - Sort the edges in `edgeList` by their distances since we need to efficiently find minimum distance paths.
   
2. **Query Handling**:
   - Sort each query by the given `limit`.
   - Initialize two pointers: one for iterating through the sorted `edgeList` and another for iterating through the sorted queries.
   - For each query (after sorting them), union the nodes in `edgeList` whose distances are less than the query limit before checking connectivity using the Union-Find structure.

This way, each query is processed only once, and we efficiently maintain the connectivity state of the graph as we process each query.

## Code

```python
class DistanceLimitedPathsExist:
    
    def __init__(self, n: int, edgeList: List[List[int]]):
        self.parent = list(range(n))
        self.rank = [0] * n
        self.edgeList = sorted(edgeList, key=lambda x: x[2])  # Sort edges by distance
    
    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]

    def union(self, x, y):
        rootX = self.find(x)
        rootY = self.find(y)
        if rootX != rootY:
            if self.rank[rootX] > self.rank[rootY]:
                self.parent[rootY] = rootX
            elif self.rank[rootX] < self.rank[rootY]:
                self.parent[rootX] = rootY
            else:
                self.parent[rootY] = rootX
                self.rank[rootX] += 1

    def query(self, p: int, q: int, limit: int) -> bool:
        while self.edgeIndex < len(self.edgeList) and self.edgeList[self.edgeIndex][2] < limit:
            u, v, w = self.edgeList[self.edgeIndex]
            self.union(u, v)
            self.edgeIndex += 1
        return self.find(p) == self.find(q)
    
    def setup(self):
        self.edgeIndex = 0

# Example usage:
# n = 5
# edgeList = [[0, 1, 2], [0, 2, 4], [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 5], [3, 4, 1]]
# obj = DistanceLimitedPathsExist(n, edgeList)
# obj.setup()
# print(obj.query(0, 4, 3))  # False
# print(obj.query(0, 4, 6))  # True
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: Sorting edges takes \(O(E \log E)\), where \(E\) is the number of edges.
- **Query**: Each query takes approximately \(O(\log E + \log N)\) due to find operations and possible union operations.

Overall, the data structure is efficient for handling multiple dynamic connectivity queries with edge distance constraints.
