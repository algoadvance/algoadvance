title:  Form Array by Concatenating Subarrays of Another Array-out
permalink: /s1764
---
You are given a 2D integer array `groups` and an integer array `nums`.

You are asked to form an array `result` by concatenating the arrays in `groups` **in the given order**. Notice that you only need to add arrays at the end of `result`. You canâ€™t divide groups into subarrays (i.e., they must appear in the result array exactly as they are given in `groups`).

Return `true` if it is possible to form the array `result` as described or `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can `groups` contain empty subarrays?
   - No, `groups` will always contain non-empty subarrays.
   
2. What kind of values can `nums` and the subarrays in `groups` have?
   - Both `nums` and the subarrays in `groups` can have integer values, with no specific range constraints.

3. Can the subarrays in `groups` overlap in `nums`?
   - No, the subarrays must appear in the same order and must not overlap.

### Strategy:
1. Iterate through `nums` while trying to match subarrays from `groups` sequentially.
2. For each subarray in `groups`, check if it matches a current position in `nums`.
3. If a subarray matches, move the position in `nums` accordingly.
4. If all subarrays in `groups` can be matched in sequence within `nums`, return `true`.
5. If at any point a subarray can't be matched, return `false`.

### Code:
```python
def canChoose(groups, nums):
    i = 0  # Pointer for navigating through nums
    for group in groups:
        match = False  # Boolean variable to keep track if we found a match for current group
        while i <= len(nums) - len(group):
            if nums[i:i+len(group)] == group:
                match = True
                i += len(group)  # Move pointer forward by the length of the matched subarray
                break
            i += 1  # Move to the next position in nums and check again
        if not match:  # If we exit the while loop without finding a match, return False
            return False
    return True  # If we successfully located all groups in nums, return True

# Example usage:
groups = [[1, -1, -1], [3, -2, 0]]
nums = [1, -1, -1, 3, -2, 0]
print(canChoose(groups, nums))  # Output: True
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(N * M)** where `N` is the length of `nums` and `M` is the total length of all subarrays in `groups`.
  - The nested while loops ensure that each element is compared, potentially up to `N * M` times in the worst case.

This strategy and code will ensure that we methodically check for the subarray sequences in the provided order, guaranteeing correct results.
