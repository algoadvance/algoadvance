title:  Escape the Spreading Fire-out
permalink: /s2258
---

You are given a 2D grid containing integers. Each integer represents a cell in the forest:
- 0 represents an empty cell,
- 1 represents a tree, and
- 2 represents a fire.

Each minute, the fire spreads from a burning cell to its adjacent cells that contain trees. The fire cannot spread into empty cells. You are initially located in the upper-left cell of the grid (i.e., `grid[0][0]`). You want to reach the bottom-right cell of the grid (i.e., `grid[m-1][n-1]`) as quickly as possible before the fire reaches you.

Return the minimum number of minutes required to reach the bottom-right cell. If it's not possible to reach the bottom-right cell, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the grid boundaries always valid and the grid always rectangular?
2. Will the initial cell (`grid[0][0]`) and the target cell (`grid[m-1][n-1]`) always be empty or contain a tree and not fire?

### Strategy

1. **BFS for Fire Spread:** Use BFS to calculate the time each cell will catch fire.
2. **BFS for Escape Path:** Use BFS/priority queue to find the minimum time to escape while avoiding fire.
3. Compare the time required to escape with the time cells catch fire. 

### Code

```python
from collections import deque
import heapq

def escape_fire(grid):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    
    # Directions for movement (right, left, down, up)
    directions = [(0, 1), (0, -1), (1, 0), (-1, 0)]
    
    def fire_time():
        fire_queue = deque()
        time_to_burn = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
        
        # Initialize the fire queue and time_to_burn grid
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if grid[i][j] == 2:  # Starting fire position
                    fire_queue.append((i, j))
                    time_to_burn[i][j] = 0
        
        # BFS to spread the fire
        while fire_queue:
            x, y = fire_queue.popleft()
            current_time = time_to_burn[x][y]
            
            for dx, dy in directions:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                
                if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n and grid[nx][ny] == 1 and time_to_burn[nx][ny] == float('inf'):
                    time_to_burn[nx][ny] = current_time + 1
                    fire_queue.append((nx, ny))
        
        return time_to_burn
    
    def escape():
        person_queue = [(0, 0, 0)]  # (time, x, y)
        escape_time = [[float('inf')] * n for _ in range(m)]
        escape_time[0][0] = 0
        
        while person_queue:
            current, x, y = heapq.heappop(person_queue)
            
            for dx, dy in directions:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                
                if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n and grid[nx][ny] == 1 and current + 1 < escape_time[nx][ny] and current + 1 < time_to_burn[nx][ny]:
                    escape_time[nx][ny] = current + 1
                    heapq.heappush(person_queue, (escape_time[nx][ny], nx, ny))
        
        return escape_time

    time_to_burn = fire_time()
    escape_time = escape()
    
    if escape_time[m-1][n-1] == float('inf'):
        return -1
    return escape_time[m-1][n-1]

# Example usage:
grid = [
    [1, 2, 1],
    [1, 1, 1],
    [2, 1, 1]
]

print(escape_fire(grid))  # Output should be the minimum minutes required to escape or -1 if impossible
```

### Time Complexity

1. **BFS for Fire Spread:**
   - Each cell is visited once leading to O(m*n).

2. **BFS/priority queue for Escape Path:**
   - Similarly each cell is visited possibly multiple times but limited to O(m*n).

Combining these together, the overall complexity stands at O(m*n).
