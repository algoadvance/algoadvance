title:  Check If Word Is Valid After Substitutions-out
permalink: /s1003
---
Given a string `s`, determine if it is valid. A valid string is defined as follows:

1. It can be an empty string.
2. If `s` is valid, then `s` can be written as "abc", where `a`, `b`, and `c` are valid strings.
3. If `s` is valid, then `s` can be written as `x` + `y`, where `x` and `y` are valid strings.

Return `true` if the given string is valid, otherwise return `false`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input string contain characters other than 'a', 'b', or 'c'?
   - No, the input string will only contain the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
2. Is the input string in any particular order or length?
   - No, the string can be of any length and the characters will follow no specific order.

## Strategy
1. We will use a stack to solve this problem:
   - Traverse through each character in the string:
   - If we see 'a' or 'b', push it to the stack.
   - If we see 'c', we need to check if the previous two characters on the stack are 'a' and 'b' respectively.
     - If they are, pop these two characters from the stack because the sequence "abc" is valid.
     - If not, the string cannot be valid.
2. After processing all characters, the stack should be empty if the string is valid. If there are any characters left in the stack, it means there are unmatched sequences.

## Code
```python
def isValid(s: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    
    for char in s:
        if char == 'c':
            if len(stack) < 2 or stack[-1] != 'b' or stack[-2] != 'a':
                return False
            stack.pop()
            stack.pop()
        else:
            stack.append(char)
    
    return len(stack) == 0

# Example usage:
s1 = "aabcbc"
s2 = "abcabcababcc"
s3 = "abccba"
print(isValid(s1))  # Outputs: True
print(isValid(s2))  # Outputs: True
print(isValid(s3))  # Outputs: False
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Time Complexity**: The algorithm processes each character in the string exactly once, making the time complexity O(n) where `n` is the length of the string.
2. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) for the worst-case scenario where the stack contains all characters in the string except for the "abc" sequences that can be matched and removed.
