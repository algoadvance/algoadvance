title:  Find Common Characters-out
permalink: /s1002
---
Given a list of strings `words`, return a list of all characters that show up in all strings within the list (including duplicates). For example, if a character appears 3 times in all strings but not 4 times, you need to include that character 3 times in the final answer. 

You may return the answer in any order.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: words = ["bella","label","roller"]
Output: ["e","l","l"]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: words = ["cool","lock","cook"]
Output: ["c","o"]
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= words.length <= 100`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 100`
- `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the strings always non-empty?
   - Yes, as per the given constraints.
2. Should the order of characters in the output list matter?
   - No, the order does not matter as per the problem statement.
3. Is it possible to have strings with no common characters? 
   - Yes, in such cases, the output should be an empty list.

### Strategy
1. **Count Characters in All Words:** Utilize Python's `collections.Counter` to count the frequency of characters in each string.
2. **Find Common Minimum Frequency:** Initialize with the character count from the first word. Then, for each subsequent word, update this to keep only the minimum frequency of each character found so far.
3. **Construct Result:** Convert the final character frequency map to a list containing the characters repeated according to their minimum frequency found in all strings.

### Code

```python
from collections import Counter
from typing import List

def commonChars(words: List<String]) -> List[str]:
    # Start with the character count of the first word
    common_count = Counter(words[0])
    
    # Update the common_count with the minimum counts found in subsequent words
    for word in words[1:]:
        word_count = Counter(word)
        for char in common_count.keys():
            if char in word_count:
                common_count[char] = min(common_count[char], word_count[char])
            else:
                common_count[char] = 0
    
    # Build the result list based on the final common_count
    result = []
    for char, count in common_count.items():
        result.extend([char] * count)
    
    return result

# Example usage:
words = ["bella", "label", "roller"]
print(commonChars(words))  # Output: ["e", "l", "l"]
```

### Time Complexity
- Constructing the initial count and updating it iteratively: \( O(N \times K) \), where \( N \) is the number of words and \( K \) is the average length of each word.
- The resulting list construction is \( O(N \times K) \) in the worst case.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is \( O(N \times K) \).

This approach should be efficient given the problem constraints, handling up to 10,000 character operations comfortably.
