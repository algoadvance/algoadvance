title:  Minimum Cost Walk in Weighted Graph-out
permalink: /s3108
---

You are given a weighted graph represented as an adjacency matrix `graph` where `graph[i][j]` indicates the weight of the edge between nodes `i` and `j`. If `graph[i][j] == -1`, it means there is no direct edge between the nodes `i` and `j`. You are also given two nodes `source` and `destination`.

Return the minimum cost to walk from the `source` node to the `destination` node using any path or `-1` if no such path exists.

#### Example
```
Input: 
graph = [[0, 10, -1, -1], [10, 0, 5, -1], [5, -1, 0, 1], [-1, -1, 1, 0]]
source = 0
destination = 3

Output: 16
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the weights guaranteed to be non-negative except for indicating no edge?**
   - Yes, all actual weights are non-negative integers, and `-1` indicates no edge.
2. **Is the graph undirected or directed?**
   - Each element in the adjacency matrix can be either directed or undirected based on the problem's constraints. For this scenario, we are assuming it is undirected if not otherwise specified explicitly.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm, which is well-suited for finding the shortest path in a weighted graph with non-negative weights.

1. **Initialize Distances:** Keep an array `dist` where `dist[i]` represents the minimum distance from the `source` node to node `i`. Initialize all distances to infinity except for the `source` node which should be 0.
2. **Priority Queue:** Use a priority queue (min-heap) to always extend the smallest known distance.
3. **Relax Edges:** For each node, update the distances to its neighbors if a shorter path is found.
4. **Termination:** The algorithm finishes when all nodes are processed or when the destination node is extracted from the priority queue.

### Code

```python
import heapq

def minCostWalk(graph, source, destination):
    n = len(graph)
    dist = [float('inf')] * n
    dist[source] = 0
    
    heap = [(0, source)]  # (cost, node)
    
    while heap:
        curr_dist, u = heapq.heappop(heap)
        
        if u == destination:
            return curr_dist
        
        if curr_dist > dist[u]:
            continue
        
        for v in range(n):
            if graph[u][v] != -1:  # Only consider connected nodes
                next_dist = curr_dist + graph[u][v]
                if next_dist < dist[v]:
                    dist[v] = next_dist
                    heapq.heappush(heap, (next_dist, v))
    
    return -1 if dist[destination] == float('inf') else dist[destination]

# Example usage:
graph = [[0, 10, -1, -1], [10, 0, 5, -1], [5, -1, 0, 1], [-1, -1, 1, 0]]
source = 0
destination = 3
print(minCostWalk(graph, source, destination))  # Output: 16
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization:** O(n)
- **Priority Queue Operations:** Each node can be inserted and extracted at most once, and each edge can be relaxed at most once. In total, we have O((E + V) * log V), where E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices.
- **Total Complexity:** O(E log V + V log V), which simplifies to O(E log V) in a dense graph.

This ensures that the algorithm is efficient for the problem at hand and correctly finds the minimum cost path in the weighted graph.
