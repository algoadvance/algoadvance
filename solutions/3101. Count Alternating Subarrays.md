title:  Count Alternating Subarrays-out
permalink: /s3101
---

You are given a 0-indexed binary array `nums` and an integer `k`.

A subarray is called **alternating** if it consists of alternating 1's and 0's. Return the number of **alternating subarrays** of length `2k + 1`.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,0,1], k = 1
Output: 4

Input: nums = [1,0,1,0,1,0,1,0], k = 2
Output: 4
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we return if no subarray of length `2k + 1` is found?**
   - Return `0` in that case.

2. **Are the elements of the input array guaranteed to be only 0's and 1's?**
   - Yes, the problem specifies it is a binary array.

3. **Is the input always valid or should we handle edge cases such as empty arrays or invalid `k` values?**
   - Assume the input is always valid as per the constraints.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to identify subarrays of length `2k + 1` that are alternating (i.e., they alternate between 1's and 0's). This can be done using a sliding window approach. The algorithm can be broken down as follows:

1. **Initialization:** Start with a count of valid subarrays set to 0.
2. **Sliding Window:** Iterate through each possible starting index of the subarray (from 0 to `len(nums) - (2k + 1)`).
3. **Check Alternation:** For each subarray of length `2k + 1`, check if it is alternating.
4. **Update Count:** Increment the count if the subarray matches the alternating pattern.

### Code

```python
def count_alternating_subarrays(nums, k):
    # Length of the desired subarray
    length = 2 * k + 1
    count = 0
    
    for start in range(len(nums) - length + 1):
        # Assume the subarray is alternating until proven otherwise
        is_alternating = True
        for i in range(start, start + length - 1):
            if nums[i] == nums[i + 1]:
                is_alternating = False
                break
        if is_alternating:
            count += 1
            
    return count

# Example usage:
# nums = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1], k = 1
# Should return 4
print(count_alternating_subarrays([1, 0, 1, 0, 1], 1))

# nums = [1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], k = 2
# Should return 4
print(count_alternating_subarrays([1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0], 2))
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is \(O(n \cdot k)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array and \(k\) is the half length of the desired subarray size minus one. For each starting index, we check a subarray of length \(2k + 1\), making the inner loop run \(2k\) times, resulting in the overall complexity. However, since the inner loop is constant relative to n, we can approximate it to \(O(n)\) in practical terms.
