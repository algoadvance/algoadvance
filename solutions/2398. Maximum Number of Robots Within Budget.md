title:  Maximum Number of Robots Within Budget-out
permalink: /s2398
---

You have `n` robots. The `i-th` robot has a running cost `runningCosts[i]` per unit time and a maintenance cost `chargingCosts[i]` that needs to be paid every time the robot is turned on. You are also given an integer `budget`.

Your task is to determine the maximum number of consecutive robots that can be operated within the given budget.

- The total cost to operate a sequence of robots is the sum of their running costs times the maximum of their charging costs.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints**: What are the typical sizes for `n`, `runningCosts`, and `chargingCosts`?
2. **Budget constraints**: What range of values can the budget hold?
3. **Edge Cases**: Should we consider edge cases like empty arrays or minimal budgets?

### Strategy

1. **Sliding Window Technique**: Use a sliding window to maintain a contiguous subarray of robots. For each window, we calculate the total running cost and max charging cost, and check if the total cost is within the budget.

2. **Maintaining max charging cost**: To maintain the max charging cost efficiently, we can use a deque (double-ended queue) that keeps potential max elements for the current window.

3. **Budget Calculation**: For each window of length `k`, the total cost would be `(sum of running costs in window) + k * (max charging cost in window)`. 

### Code

```python
from collections import deque

def maximumRobots(chargingCosts, runningCosts, budget):
    n = len(chargingCosts)
    
    max_len = 0
    current_sum_running_cost = 0
    max_charging_cost_deque = deque()
    left = 0
    
    for right in range(n):
        # Include the current robot's running cost
        current_sum_running_cost += runningCosts[right]
        
        # Maintain the maximum charging cost in the window
        while max_charging_cost_deque and chargingCosts[max_charging_cost_deque[-1]] <= chargingCosts[right]:
            max_charging_cost_deque.pop()
        max_charging_cost_deque.append(right)
        
        # Compute the total cost of the current window
        window_length = right - left + 1
        current_max_charging_cost = chargingCosts[max_charging_cost_deque[0]]
        total_cost = current_sum_running_cost + window_length * current_max_charging_cost
        
        # Adjust the window if the total cost exceeds the budget
        while total_cost > budget and left <= right:
            current_sum_running_cost -= runningCosts[left]
            if max_charging_cost_deque[0] == left:
                max_charging_cost_deque.popleft()
            left += 1
            window_length = right - left + 1
            current_max_charging_cost = chargingCosts[max_charging_cost_deque[0]] if max_charging_cost_deque else 0
            total_cost = current_sum_running_cost + window_length * current_max_charging_cost
        
        max_len = max(max_len, window_length)
    
    return max_len

# Example usage:
chargingCosts = [3, 6, 1, 3, 4]
runningCosts = [2, 1, 3, 4, 5]
budget = 25
print(maximumRobots(chargingCosts, runningCosts, budget))  # Output should match expected result based on inputs
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sliding Window Process**: O(n), because each robot index is added to and removed from the deque at most once.
- **Total Complexity**: O(n) due to the single pass we make over the robots and efficient management of maximum charging cost using a deque.

This approach ensures we find the maximum number of consecutive robots that can be operated within the provided budget efficiently.
