title:  Find the Minimum Number of Fibonacci Numbers Whose Sum Is K-out
permalink: /s1414
---
Given an integer `k`, find the minimum number of Fibonacci numbers whose sum is equal to `k`. Each Fibonacci number can be used multiple times.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are there any constraints on the value of `k`?**
   - The constraints mentioned in the problem are typically \(1 \leq k \leq 10^9\).
2. **Is there a limit on the size of the Fibonacci numbers we can use?**
   - The problem implicitly suggests that we can use as many Fibonacci numbers as necessary up to `k`.

## Strategy
To find the minimum number of Fibonacci numbers whose sum is `k`, we can use a greedy approach. Here are the steps to solve the problem:

1. **Generate Fibonacci Numbers up to `k`**: First, generate all Fibonacci numbers up to `k`. This will give us a list of Fibonacci numbers we can use.
2. **Greedy Selection**: Starting from the largest Fibonacci number, try to subtract it from `k` as many times as possible until `k` becomes zero.
3. **Count the Minimum Numbers**: Keep a count of how many Fibonacci numbers we have used.

## Code Implementation
Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
def findMinFibonacciNumbers(k: int) -> int:
    # Generate Fibonacci numbers up to k
    fibs = [1, 1]
    while fibs[-1] < k:
        fibs.append(fibs[-1] + fibs[-2])
    
    # Since we want the largest first, reverse the list
    fibs.reverse()
    
    count = 0
    for fib in fibs:
        if k == 0:
            break
        if fib <= k:
            k -= fib
            count += 1
    
    return count

# Example usage:
k = 19
print(findMinFibonacciNumbers(k))  # Output should be 3 (8 + 5 + 3 + 3)
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Generating Fibonacci Numbers**: This takes \(O(\log k)\) time since each Fibonacci number grows exponentially.
2. **Greedy Subtraction**: For each Fibonacci number, we perform a constant time check and subtraction. This part is linear with respect to the number of Fibonacci numbers generated, i.e., \(O(\log k)\).

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(\log k)\).
