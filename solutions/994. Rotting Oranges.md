title:  Rotting Oranges-out
permalink: /s994

You are given an `m x n` grid where each cell can have one of three values:

- `0` representing an empty cell,
- `1` representing a fresh orange,
- `2` representing a rotten orange.

Every minute, any fresh orange that is **4-directionally adjacent** to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return the _minimum number of minutes_ that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return `-1`.

### Example:

**Input:**
```python
grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
```

**Output:**
```python
4
```

### Constraints:

- `m == grid.length`
- `n == grid[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 10`
- `grid[i][j]` is `0`, `1`, or `2`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume that the grid will always have at least one fresh or rotten orange?
2. Should we handle any scenarios where the grid might be entirely empty?
3. Can there be cells with values other than `0`, `1`, and `2`?

## Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - Use a queue to perform a BFS traversal starting from all initial rotten oranges.
   - For each rotten orange, traverse its 4-directional neighbors and rot any fresh oranges.
   - Keep track of the time using a counter.

2. **Queue Initialization:**
   - Initialize the queue with all the initially rotten oranges.
   - Also, count the total number of fresh oranges.

3. **BFS Execution:**
   - For each level in BFS, increment the time counter.
   - For each rotten orange, rot its adjacent fresh oranges and add them to the queue.
   - Decrease the count of fresh oranges.

4. **Check Completion:**
   - If there are still fresh oranges left after the BFS, return `-1`.
   - Otherwise, return the time counter.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(m \times n)\) where \(m\) is the number of rows and \(n\) is the number of columns in the grid. Each cell is added to the queue at most once, and checking the neighbors takes constant time.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(m \times n)\) for the queue storage, plus some additional space for variables to store the count of fresh and rotten oranges.

Let's implement this strategy in code.

## Code

```python
from collections import deque

def orangesRotting(grid):
    if not grid:
        return -1
    
    rows, cols = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    queue = deque()
    fresh_oranges = 0

    # Initialize queue with initially rotten oranges, count fresh oranges.
    for r in range(rows):
        for c in range(cols):
            if grid[r][c] == 2:
                queue.append((r, c))
            elif grid[r][c] == 1:
                fresh_oranges += 1
    
    # Directions for the 4-directional movement.
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    minutes = 0

    # BFS to rot adjacent fresh oranges.
    while queue and fresh_oranges > 0:
        minutes += 1
        for _ in range(len(queue)):
            x, y = queue.popleft()
            for dx, dy in directions:
                nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
                if 0 <= nx < rows and 0 <= ny < cols and grid[nx][ny] == 1:
                    grid[nx][ny] = 2
                    fresh_oranges -= 1
                    queue.append((nx, ny))
    
    return minutes if fresh_oranges == 0 else -1

# Example usage:
grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
print(orangesRotting(grid))  # Output: 4
```

This code will correctly compute the minimum minutes needed for all oranges to rot, or determine that it's impossible.
