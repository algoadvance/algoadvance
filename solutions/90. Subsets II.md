Given a collection of integers that might contain duplicates, `nums`, return all possible subsets (the power set). The solution set must not contain duplicate subsets. Return the solution in any order.

### Example:

```python
Input: nums = [1,2,2]
Output: [[],[1],[1,2],[1,2,2],[2],[2,2]]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the input list `nums` be empty?
   - **A:** Yes, if the input list is empty, the output should be `[[]]`.

2. **Q:** Are the elements of the list always integers?
   - **A:** Yes, the problem statement specifies a collection of integers.

3. **Q:** Is there any constraint on the size of the input list?
   - **A:** There is no explicit constraint mentioned, but typical list sizes in coding problems can range up to hundreds or thousands. LeetCode usually specifies constraints in the full problem description.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Input List:**
   - Sorting helps to easily skip duplicates when generating subsets.

2. **Backtracking Approach:**
   - Use a backtracking algorithm to explore all possible subsets.
   - At each step in the recursion, choose to either include the current element or not.
   - To avoid duplicates, skip elements that are the same as the previous element.
   - Maintain a list to collect the current subset and add it to the final result.

3. **Avoid Duplicates:**
   - By sorting the list initially, we can easily compare the current element with the previous one and skip processing if they are the same.

### Code

Here's the Python code implementing the above strategy:

```python
def subsetsWithDup(nums):
    def backtrack(start, path):
        # Add the current subset (path) to the result
        result.append(path[:])
        for i in range(start, len(nums)):
            # If current element is same as previous, skip it to avoid duplicates
            if i > start and nums[i] == nums[i - 1]:
                continue
            # Include nums[i] in the current subset
            path.append(nums[i])
            # Move onto the next element
            backtrack(i + 1, path)
            # Exclude nums[i] from the current subset (backtrack)
            path.pop()

    nums.sort()
    result = []
    backtrack(0, [])
    return result

# Example Usage
nums = [1, 2, 2]
print(subsetsWithDup(nums))  # Output: [[], [1], [1, 2], [1, 2, 2], [2], [2, 2]]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** Sorting the list initially takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of `nums`.
- **Generating Subsets:** In the worst case, there are \(2^n\) possible subsets.
  - Since for each subset, the backtracking function does work proportional to its size, generating all subsets takes \(O(n \cdot 2^n)\) time.
  - This is because each subset takes linear time to be processed at each step, and there are \(2^n\) subsets.
- **Overall Complexity:** \(O(n \log n) + O(n \cdot 2^n) = O(n \cdot 2^n)\)

### Space Complexity

- **Auxiliary Space:** The auxiliary space used by the recursion stack is \(O(n)\).
- **Result Storage:** The result list potentially contains \(2^n\) subsets, each of which might be up to length \(n\).
  - This results in \(O(n \cdot 2^n)\) space for storing all subsets.
  
Thus, the overall space complexity is also \(O(n \cdot 2^n)\).
