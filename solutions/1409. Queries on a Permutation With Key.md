title:  Queries on a Permutation With Key-out
permalink: /s1409
---
Given the array `queries` of positive integers between `1` and `m`, you have to process all `queries[i]` (from `i = 0` to `i = queries.length - 1`) according to the following rules:
1. Initially, you have the permutation `P = [1, 2, 3, ..., m]`.
2. For the current `i-th` query `queries[i]`:
   - Find the position of `queries[i]` in the permutation `P`.
   - Move this element to the front of the permutation `P`.
   - Note that the position is 0-indexed.

Return an array of the positions for each query.

## Clarifying Questions
- How large can the values of `m` and `queries.length` be?
- Can `queries` contain duplicate values?
- Should the algorithm be optimized for time and/or space complexity?

## Code
Let's write the code to solve the problem.

```python
def processQueries(queries, m):
    # Initialize the permutation P
    P = list(range(1, m + 1))
    result = []
    
    for query in queries:
        # Find the position of current query in permutation P
        index = P.index(query)
        # Append the index to the result
        result.append(index)
        # Move the element to the front of the permutation
        P.pop(index)
        P.insert(0, query)
    
    return result

# Example Usage
queries = [3, 1, 2, 1]
m = 5
print(processQueries(queries, m))  # Output: [2, 1, 2, 1]
```

## Strategy
1. **Initialization**: Start with the permutation `P` from `1` to `m`.
2. **Processing Queries**: For each query in `queries`:
   - Find the index of the current query in `P` (using `index()` method).
   - Store this index in the result.
   - Remove the element from its current position and insert it at the front of `P`.

This method directly manipulates the list to achieve the desired behavior.

## Time Complexity
- Finding an element's index in a list (using `index()` method) takes `O(m)`.
- Removing an element and inserting it at the front of the list together take `O(m)` because the list elements need to be shifted.

Since we have `n` queries:
- The overall time complexity is `O(n * m)`.

While this approach is straightforward, it may not be optimal for very large inputs. For more efficient solutions, more sophisticated data structures like Fenwick Trees or Segment Trees might be required.
