title:  Find Resultant Array After Removing Anagrams-out
permalink: /s2273
---

### Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed string array `words`, where `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters. In one operation, select any `words[i]` and remove it if `words[i-1]` is an anagram of `words[i]`. You must repeatedly perform this operation until no adjacent elements in the array are anagrams of each other. Return `words` after performing all operations.

### Clarifying Questions
To ensure we understand the requirements correctly, let's clarify a few points:
1. **What is an anagram?** 
   - Two strings are anagrams if they contain the same characters in the same frequency.
2. **What is the significance of `words[i-1]` and `words[i]`?**
   - We only consider adjacent elements for being anagrams.
3. **What happens if multiple operations can be performed?**
   - Operations are performed iteratively until no more adjacent anagrams exist.

### Strategy
1. **Iterate through the list:**
   - We will use a stack to keep track of the resultant array.
   - For each word in the list, push it onto the stack if the stack is empty or if it is not an anagram of the stack's top element.
   - If it is an anagram, pop the last element from the stack (effectively removing an adjacent anagram pair).

2. **Helper Function to Determine Anagrams:**
   - Create a helper function `are_anagrams(word1, word2)` to determine if two words are anagrams by comparing their sorted characters.

3. **Efficiency:**
   - Sorting each word to check for anagrams will take \(O(K \log K)\) where `K` is the maximal length of any word in the list.
   - The overall time complexity will be \(O(N \times K \log K)\) where `N` is the number of words in the list.

### Code
Here is the implementation of the strategy described:

```python
def are_anagrams(word1, word2):
    return sorted(word1) == sorted(word2)

def remove_anagrams(words):
    stack = []
    
    for word in words:
        if stack and are_anagrams(stack[-1], word):
            stack.pop()  # remove the last word if it is an anagram with the current word
        else:
            stack.append(word)
    
    return stack

# Example usage:
words = ["abba", "baba", "bbaa", "cd", "dc"]
print(remove_anagrams(words))  # Output should be ['abba', 'cd']
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting each word:** \(O(K \log K)\) where `K` is the maximum length of the words in the array.
- **Total time complexity:** \(O(N \times K \log K)\), where `N` is the number of words.

This should yield the correct resultant array after removing all adjacent anagrams as specified.
