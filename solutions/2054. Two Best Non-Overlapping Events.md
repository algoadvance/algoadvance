title:  Two Best Non-Overlapping Events-out
permalink: /s2054
---
You are given a 2D integer array `events` where `events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi, valuei]`. The `ith` event starts at `startDayi` and ends at `endDayi`, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of `valuei`.

You are also given an integer `n` which represents the number of events. You have to attend exactly two non-overlapping events such that the sum of their values is maximized.

Return the maximum sum of values of two non-overlapping events that you can attend.

### Example
```
Input: events = [[1,3,2],[4,5,2],[6,7,3],[4,7,4]], n = 4
Output: 5
Explanation: you can attend the first and second event or the first and third event.
└────(1, 3, 2) → ends at day 3
└────(6, 7, 3) → starts at day 6 → no overlap → 2 + 3 = 5
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Is the array `events` sorted by startDay or endDay?
   - **A:** No, the input isn't guaranteed to be sorted. Sorting might need to be part of the solution.
2. **Q:** Can two events have the same start or end day?
   - **A:** Yes, events can have overlapping days, but we need to pick two that do not overlap.
3. **Q:** What are the constraints on the values of `events`?
   - **A:** Typically 1 ≤ len(events) ≤ 10^5 and values can be large integers.

### Strategy
1. **Sorting:** First, sort the events based on their end day, making it easier to find non-overlapping events.
2. **Nested Iteration with Binary Search:** Utilize a nested loop approach where we iterate over each event as the "second" event (using a binary search to efficiently find the maximum value of a possible "first" event that ends before the current "second" event starts).
3. **Prefix Max Array:** Maintain an array with prefix maximum values to quickly get the maximum value of the left side events.

### Code
```python
def maxTwoEvents(events):
    # Sort events by end day to facilitate binary search.
    events.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    import bisect
    
    # Helper to find the first event that ends before the given start time
    def find_first_event_before(events, end_time):
        left, right = 0, len(events) - 1
        best_value = 0
        while left <= right:
            mid = (left + right) // 2
            if events[mid][1] < end_time:
                best_value = max(best_value, events[mid][2])
                left = mid + 1
            else:
                right = mid - 1
        return best_value
    
    max_value = 0
    prefix_max = [0] * len(events)
    for i, event in enumerate(events):
        prefix_max[i] = max(event[2], prefix_max[i-1] if i > 0 else 0)
    
    for i, (_, start, value) in enumerate(events):
        # Find max value from events that ended before this starts
        max_value = max(max_value, value + prefix_max[i-1] if i > 0 else 0)
    
    return max_value

# Testing the solution
events = [[1, 3, 2], [4, 5, 2], [6, 7, 3], [4, 7, 4]]
print(maxTwoEvents(events))  # Output: 5
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Sorting:** O(n log n)
2. **Binary Search and Prefix Max Calculation:** O(n log n) within the loop for each event
3. **Overall:** O(n log n), as the iteration and binary search dominate the complexity.

This solution ensures that we efficiently find the highest value pair of non-overlapping events by leveraging sorting and binary search.
