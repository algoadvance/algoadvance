title:  Display Table of Food Orders in a Restaurant-out
permalink: /s1418
---

You are given the array `orders`, where each `orders[i] = ["customerNamei", "tableNumberi", "foodItemi"]`. The `customerName`i is the name of the customer, `tableNumber`i is the table customer sit at, and `foodItem`i is the item customer orders.

Return the restaurant's **"display table"**. The "display table" is a table whose row represents a table and the columns represent the food items. The first column is the table number, and the subsequent columns correspond to each food item in lexicographical order. The first row should be the header with `foodItem`s. The remaining rows should correspond to each table's `tableNumber` followed by the number of times each food item was ordered at them.

Return the display table as a list of strings and each entry should have multiple space-separated values. The table numbers should be in numerically increasing order.

### Example:
**Input:**
```
orders = [["David","3","Ceviche"],["Corina","10","Beef Burrito"],["David","3","Fried Chicken"],["Carla","5","Water"],["Carla","5","Ceviche"],["Rous","3","Ceviche"]]
```
**Output:**
```
[
"Table Ceviche Fried Chicken Beef Burrito Water",
"3 2 1 0 0",
"5 1 0 0 1",
"10 0 0 1 0"
]
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= orders.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `1 <= customerNamei.length, foodItemi.length <= 20`
- `customerNamei` and `foodItemi` consist of lowercase and uppercase English letters and the space character.
- `tableNumberi` is a valid integer between 1 and 500.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Should the food items be sorted in lexicographical order in the output table?
   - Yes, the columns for food items should appear in lexicographical order.
   
2. Can table numbers repeat across different orders?
   - Yes, table numbers can repeat across different orders.

3. Are there any constraints on character casing or special characters in the `customerName` or `foodItem`?
   - The `customerName` and `foodItem` consist of English letters and space character only.

## Strategy

1. Use a set to record all unique food items.
2. Use a dictionary where the key is the table number and the value is another dictionary that records the count of each ordered food item.
3. After gathering all necessary information, generate the header by sorting the food items lexicographically.
4. For each table, create a row starting with the table number followed by the counts of each food item in the order they appear in the header.
5. Sort the rows by table number numerically and combine them to form the final result.

## Code

Here's the implementation of the given strategy:

```python
def displayTable(orders):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Step 1: Track all unique food items
    food_items = sorted(set(order[2] for order in orders))
    
    # Header row
    header = ["Table"] + food_items
    
    # Step 2: Organize order counts by table
    table_orders = defaultdict(lambda: defaultdict(int))
    
    for _, table_number, food_item in orders:
        table_orders[table_number][food_item] += 1
    
    # Step 3: Prepare the result
    result = []
    
    # Adding header row
    result.append(" ".join(header))
    
    # Adding rows for each table
    for table_number in sorted(table_orders, key=int):
        row = [table_number]
        for food_item in food_items:
            row.append(str(table_orders[table_number].get(food_item, 0)))
        result.append(" ".join(row))
    
    return result
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** 
  - Collecting all unique food items: O(n log n), where n is the length of orders, because of sorting.
  - Populating the table orders dictionary: O(n), iterating once through orders.
  - Generating the result: O(t * f), where t is the number of tables and f is the number of food items.
  - Sorting table numbers: O(t log t).

- **Overall Complexity:**
  - O(n log n + t * f), which is efficient given the constraints.

This approach ensures that we capture all required information efficiently and output the table in the specified format.
