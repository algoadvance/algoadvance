title:  Frog Jump-out
permalink: /s403
---

A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into some number of units, and at each unit, there may or may not exist a stone. The frog can jump on a stone, but it must avoid floating in the water.

You are given a list of stones' positions in the river in sorted ascending order. Initially, the frog is on the first stone (position 0). The frog makes a jump of k units to move from its current stone to another stone, where k is the former jump distance. The frog may decide to jump k - 1, k, or k + 1 units for the next jump.

Return `True` if the frog can reach the last stone, or `False` otherwise.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: stones = [0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 12, 17]
Output: True
Explanation: The frog can jump to the last stone by following these steps:
Jump 1 unit to the stone at position 1.
Then jump 2 units to the stone at position 3.
Then jump 2 units to the stone at position 5.
Then jump 3 units to the stone at position 8.
Then jump 4 units to the stone at position 12.
Then jump 5 units to the stone at position 17.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: stones = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 11]
Output: False
Explanation: There is no way to jump to the last stone as the gap between stone 4 and stone 8 is too large.
```

**Constraints:**
- `2 <= stones.length <= 2000`
- `0 <= stones[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- `stones[0] == 0`
- `stones` is sorted in a strictly increasing order.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the frog move to a stone that's not immediately next?**
   - Yes, the frog can jump up to k+1 units, where k is the previous jump distance, provided there is a stone at that position.
2. **Can the frog's next jump distance be zero or negative?**
   - No, the frog can only jump k-1, k, or k+1 units, where k is the previous jump distance and must always be a positive number.

### Strategy
1. **Dynamic Programming with a Set State Representation:**
   - We use a dictionary to represent possible states, where the key is the stone position and the value is a set of possible jump distances that can arrive at that stone.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - Start from the first stone at position `0` with an initial jump of `0` units since the frog begins at the first stone.

3. **State Transition:**
   - At each stone, iterate over possible jump distances and attempt to move to the next stone using either k-1, k, or k+1 distances.
   - If the stone exists at the new position, update the new stone's possible jump distances accordingly.

4. **Check if the Last Stone is Reachable:**
   - Return `True` if we can reach the last stone with any jump distance.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of the solution is O(n^2), where n is the number of stones, since each stone can potentially have n-1 possible jump distances and we need to check against each stone for valid transitions.

### Code

```python
def canCross(stones):
    if not stones:
        return False
    
    stone_positions = set(stones)
    last_stone = stones[-1]
    
    # Dictionary to store positions and possible jump distances
    jumps_dict = {stone: set() for stone in stones}
    jumps_dict[0].add(1)
    
    for stone in stones:
        for jump in jumps_dict[stone]:
            for k in range(jump - 1, jump + 2):
                if k > 0 and (stone + k) in stone_positions:
                    jumps_dict[stone + k].add(k)
                    
    return bool(jumps_dict[last_stone])

# Example usage:
print(canCross([0, 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 12, 17]))  # Output: True
print(canCross([0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 8, 9, 11]))   # Output: False
```

The provided code implements the strategy using a dictionary to track possible jump distances for each stone while iterating over possible moves to other stones and returns `True` if the last stone is reachable.
