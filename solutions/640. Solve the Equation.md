title:  Solve the Equation-out
permalink: /s640
---
You are given a string that represents an equation of the form `ax + b = cx + d` where:

- `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are integers, and
- `x` is the variable in question.

Your task is to solve for `x`.

If there is a solution for `x`, return it as a string in the form `"x=#value"`, where `#value` is an integer. If there are infinite solutions, return `"Infinite solutions"`. If there is no solution, return `"No solution"`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: "x+5-3+x=6+x-2"
Output: "x=2"
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: "x=x"
Output: "Infinite solutions"
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: "2x=x"
Output: "x=0"
```

### Example 4:
```
Input: "2x+3x-6x=x+2"
Output: "x=-1"
```

### Example 5:
```
Input: "x=x+2"
Output: "No solution"
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are all the constants and coefficients in the equation integers?
2. Can the input string always be assumed to be a valid equation format?

## Strategy
1. **Parse the Equation**: Split the equation at the `=` sign to separate it into the left-hand side (LHS) and the right-hand side (RHS).
2. **Coefficient Extraction**: Define a helper function to extract the coefficient of `x` and the constant term from the string.
3. **Combine Coefficients**: Sum up the coefficients of `x` and constants for both sides of the equation.
4. **Solve Equation**: 
   - If the coefficients of `x` on both sides are the same, check the constants:
     - If constants are also the same, return `"Infinite solutions"`.
     - Otherwise, return `"No solution"`.
   - If the coefficients are different, solve for `x`.

## Code
Here's a complete Python code implementing the strategy:

```python
def solveEquation(equation: str) -> str:
    def parse_expr(expr):
        # Initialize variables to hold the sum of x coefficients and constant term
        x_coeff = 0
        const = 0
        num = 0
        sign = 1  # 1 means positive sign, -1 means negative sign
        i = 0
        n = len(expr)
        while i < n:
            if expr[i] == '+':
                sign = 1
                i += 1
            elif expr[i] == '-':
                sign = -1
                i += 1
            elif expr[i] == 'x':
                # Check if 'x' is preceded by a number
                if i == 0 or not expr[i-1].isdigit():
                    # The coefficient before 'x' is either 1 or -1
                    x_coeff += sign
                else:
                    x_coeff += sign * num
                num = 0
                i += 1
            else:
                num = 0
                while i < n and expr[i].isdigit():
                    num = num * 10 + int(expr[i])
                    i += 1
                if i < n and expr[i] == 'x':
                    x_coeff += sign * num
                    i += 1
                else:
                    const += sign * num
                    num = 0
        return x_coeff, const

    # Split the equation into LHS and RHS
    lhs, rhs = equation.split('=')
    lhs_x_coeff, lhs_const = parse_expr(lhs)
    rhs_x_coeff, rhs_const = parse_expr(rhs)

    # Calculate the net coefficients and constant term
    net_x_coeff = lhs_x_coeff - rhs_x_coeff
    net_const = rhs_const - lhs_const

    if net_x_coeff == 0:
        if net_const == 0:
            return "Infinite solutions"
        else:
            return "No solution"
    else:
        x_value = net_const // net_x_coeff
        return f"x={x_value}"

# Test the function with a sample input
equation = "x+5-3+x=6+x-2"
print(solveEquation(equation))  # Output: "x=2"
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string. This is because we are processing each character in the string exactly once during the parsing steps.
