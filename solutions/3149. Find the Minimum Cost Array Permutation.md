title:  Find the Minimum Cost Array Permutation-out
permalink: /s3149
---

You are given an integer array `arr`. You need to find the permutation of the array `arr` that has the minimum sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements. More specifically, you need to reorder the elements in `arr` such that the total sum of absolute differences between each consecutive pair of elements is minimized. Return the permutation that achieves this smallest sum.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What are the constraints on the length of the array?
   - What are the constraints on the elements of the array?

2. **Output**:
   - Should we return the array itself or the sum of the absolute differences?
   - Are there any specific requirements for the format of the output?
   
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - How to handle arrays with a single element?
   - How to handle arrays with all elements the same?

Given the problem requires a permutation with a minimal sum of absolute differences, a natural strategy is to order the elements in some optimal configuration. Here is a structured approach to tackle this problem:

### Strategy

1. **Sorting the Array**:
    - If we sort the array in ascending order, the sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements will naturally be minimized. This is because, for any two elements \( a_i \) and \( a_{i+1} \) in a sorted array, \( |a_{i+1} - a_i| \) is minimized. Consecutive differences in sorted arrays tend to be the smallest possible within the given array.

2. **Greedy Approach**:
   - Since sorting gives the minimal adjacent differences, iterating through a sorted array from start to end will give us the minimal possible sum of absolute differences.

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the array takes \( O(n \log n) \) where \( n \) is the number of elements in the array.
- Constructing the resulting permutation will take \( O(n) \).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \( O(n \log n) \).

Let's implement this approach in code:

### Code

```python
def min_cost_permutation(arr):
    # Sorting the input array
    arr_sorted = sorted(arr)
    
    # Returning the sorted array as it is the required permutation
    return arr_sorted

# Example usage
arr = [4, 2, 1, 3]
print(min_cost_permutation(arr))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### Explanation

1. **Sorting**:
   - We first sort the array, which ensures that the difference between consecutive elements is minimized.

2. **Result**:
   - The sorted array itself is returned since it inherently represents the permutation with the minimal sum of absolute differences between consecutive elements.
