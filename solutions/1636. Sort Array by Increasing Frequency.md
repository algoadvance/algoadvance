title:  Sort Array by Increasing Frequency-out
permalink: /s1636
---

Given an array of integers `nums`, sort the array in an increasing order based on the frequency of the values. If multiple values have the same frequency, sort them in decreasing order.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,1,2,2,2,3]
Output: [3,1,1,2,2,2]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [2,3,1,3,2]
Output: [1,3,3,2,2]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [-1,1,-6,4,5,-6,1,4,1]
Output: [5,-1,4,4,-6,-6,1,1,1]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: What should we do if the input list is empty?
   - **A**: Return an empty list.

2. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the size of the input list?
   - **A**: The problem does not explicitly state constraints, but typical LeetCode constraints apply.

3. **Q**: Can the input list contain duplicates?
   - **A**: Yes, as indicated by the examples.

## Strategy

1. **Frequency Calculation**:
   - Use a dictionary or `Counter` from the `collections` module to count the frequency of each element in `nums`.

2. **Sort with Custom Logic**:
   - Sort the array with a custom key:
     - The primary key is the frequency of the elements (ascending).
     - The secondary key is the value of the elements (descending).

3. **Reconstruct Result**:
   - Construct the result based on the sorted elements.

## Code

```python
from collections import Counter

def frequencySort(nums):
    # Step 1: Count the frequency of each number
    freq = Counter(nums)
    
    # Step 2: Sort based on custom logic
    nums.sort(key=lambda x: (freq[x], -x))
    
    return nums

# Example Usage
print(frequencySort([1,1,2,2,2,3]))  # Output: [3,1,1,2,2,2]
print(frequencySort([2,3,1,3,2]))    # Output: [1,3,3,2,2]
print(frequencySort([-1,1,-6,4,5,-6,1,4,1]))  # Output: [5,-1,4,4,-6,-6,1,1,1]
```

## Time Complexity

- **Frequency Counting**: O(N) where N is the number of elements in `nums`, as we iterate through the list once to count frequencies.
- **Sorting**: O(N log N) due to the sorting step. The custom sorting function operates in constant time O(1) for each comparison.
- **Overall Complexity**: O(N log N) due to the sorting being the dominant step.
