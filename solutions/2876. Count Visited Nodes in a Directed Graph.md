title:  Count Visited Nodes in a Directed Graph-out
permalink: /s2876
---

You are given a directed graph represented as an array `edges` where `edges[i]` is the index of the node to which node `i` is directed. In other words, `i` directs to `edges[i]`. This forms a singly linked list/directed graph structure. The graph might contain cycles and self-loops.

Your task is to count the number of nodes that are accessible starting from each node. Return an array where the `i-th` element is the number of nodes that can be visited starting from node `i`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Self-loops and cycles**: Can nodes direct to themselves, and can there be cycles in the graph?
   - Yes, nodes can direct to themselves, and cycles can exist.
  
2. **Node count limit**: Do we have a constraint on the number of nodes in the graph?
   - Constraints typically exist but can be large, e.g., \(1 \leq \text{nodes} \leq 10^5\).

3. **Graph properties**: Is the graph always connected, or can there be multiple disconnected components?
   - The graph can have multiple disconnected components/singly linked lists.

### Strategy

1. **Cycle Detection and Sizes**: We need to identify cycles in the graph and determine their sizes. Nodes within a cycle can visit all the nodes within the same cycle.

2. **DFS/BFS for Path Counting**: Use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to count nodes reachable from each starting node. Cache results to avoid recomputation and cycles.

3. **Visited and Cache Arrays**: Use two arrays: one to mark visited nodes and another to cache the result of the number of reachable nodes from each node.
   
### Code

Here's a Python function to solve the problem using the outlined strategy:

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def countVisitedNodes(edges):
    def dfs(node):
        visited[node] = True
        cycle_nodes.append(node)
        next_node = edges[node]
        if not visited[next_node]:
            return dfs(next_node)
        elif next_node in cycle_nodes:
            cycle_start_idx = cycle_nodes.index(next_node)
            return len(cycle_nodes) - cycle_start_idx
        else:
            return 0

    def mark_cycle_and_cache(cycle_start_idx):
        cycle_size = len(cycle_nodes) - cycle_start_idx
        for i in range(cycle_start_idx, len(cycle_nodes)):
            reachable_count[cycle_nodes[i]] = cycle_size
        for i in range(cycle_start_idx):
            reachable_count[cycle_nodes[i]] = cycle_size + (i - cycle_start_idx)

    n = len(edges)
    reachable_count = [-1] * n
    visited = [False] * n

    for i in range(n):
        if not visited[i]:
            cycle_nodes = []
            cycle_length = dfs(i)
            if cycle_length > 0:
                cycle_start_idx = -cycle_length
                mark_cycle_and_cache(cycle_start_idx)
            for node in cycle_nodes:
                if reachable_count[node] == -1:
                    reachable_count[node] = len(cycle_nodes)
    
    return reachable_count
```

### Step-by-step Plan:

1. Initialize `reachable_count` to `-1` for all nodes to cache the result of reachable nodes.
2. Initialize the `visited` array to track nodes that have been processed.
3. Use DFS to traverse nodes, detect cycles, and fill the cycle nodes list.
4. If a cycle is detected, calculate the cycle length and update the reachable count for nodes within and before the cycle.
5. Return the `reachable_count` array which gives the number of nodes visited starting from each node.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the number of nodes. Each node and each edge is processed at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) for storing the `reachable_count`, `visited`, and additional stack space for recursion (DFS).

This approach ensures efficient handling of cycles and linear paths within the directed graph.
