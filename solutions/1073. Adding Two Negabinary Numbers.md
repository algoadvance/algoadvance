title:  Adding Two Negabinary Numbers-out
permalink: /s1073
---
Given two negabinary numbers `arr1` and `arr2`, representing two numbers in base `-2`, return the sum of the two numbers in the same base, in the form of an array.

**Example:**
```python
Input: arr1 = [1,1,1,1,1], arr2 = [1,0,1]
Output: [1,0,0,0,0]
Explanation: arr1 = 1 * (-2)**4 + 1 * (-2)**3 + 1 * (-2)**2 + 1 * (-2)**1 + 1 = 25, 
arr2 = 1 * (-2)**2 + 0 * (-2)**1 + 1 = 5, 
and their sum is 25 + 5 = 30. 
Therefore, the output is [1, 0, 0, 0, 0] which represents 30 in base -2.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input & Output Format**: Are the inputs always valid negabinary numbers? Is the output expected to be the minimal representation of the sum in negabinary format?
2. **Leading Zeros**: Should leading zeros in the output be removed?
3. **Negative Numbers**: How should we handle cases where the result includes negative numbers?

## Strategy
1. **Convert Base -2 to Decimal**:
   - Convert `arr1` and `arr2` from base `-2` to decimal.
   
2. **Add the Decimal Values**:
   - Add the decimal representations of both arrays.

3. **Convert Back to Base -2**:
   - Convert the resulting decimal sum back to base `-2`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle special cases where the sum is zero or has unique representations in base -2.

## Code
```python
def addNegabinary(arr1, arr2):
    # Helper function to convert base -2 array to decimal
    def to_decimal(arr):
        num = 0
        for i, bit in enumerate(reversed(arr)):
            num += bit * ((-2) ** i)
        return num
    
    # Helper function to convert decimal to base -2 array
    def to_negabinary(num):
        if num == 0:
            return [0]
        res = []
        while num != 0:
            bit = num % -2
            num = num // -2
            if bit < 0:
                bit += 2
                num += 1
            res.append(bit)
        return res[::-1]
    
    # Convert both arrays to decimal
    decimal1 = to_decimal(arr1)
    decimal2 = to_decimal(arr2)
    
    # Sum the decimal values
    decimal_sum = decimal1 + decimal2
    
    # Convert the sum back to base -2
    return to_negabinary(decimal_sum)

# Example usage:
arr1 = [1,1,1,1,1]
arr2 = [1,0,1]
print(addNegabinary(arr1, arr2))  # Output: [1,0,0,0,0]
```

## Time Complexity
- Conversion from base `-2` to decimal takes \(O(n)\), where `n` is the length of the input array.
- The addition of two decimal numbers is \(O(1)\).
- Conversion from decimal back to base `-2` takes \(O(k)\), where `k` is the number of digits in the resulting base `-2` number.

Overall time complexity: \(O(n)\) for each array, resulting in \(O(n + m)\) where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `arr1` and `arr2` respectively.
