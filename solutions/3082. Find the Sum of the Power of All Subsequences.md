title:  Find the Sum of the Power of All Subsequences-out
permalink: /s3082
---

Given an integer array `nums`, return the sum of the power of all non-empty subsequences of `nums`. Since the sum can be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from `nums` by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. The power of a subsequence is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the subsequence.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What if the array is empty?** 
   - The problem specifies we need to consider only non-empty subsequences, so this should not be a concern.
   
2. **What kind of constraints should we consider?**
   - The size of the array and the range of the values within the array will determine our approach. Assuming typical constraints, for now, we handle arrays up to size `10^5`.

3. **Should the output be modulo `10^9 + 7`?**
   - Yes, the problem statement explicitly requires the result to be modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Strategy

To solve this problem:
1. Sort the array `nums`. This will help us in efficiently calculating the max and min of each subsequence.
2. Use combination properties to calculate the contribution of each element to the final result:
   - For an element at index `i` in the sorted array:
     - It acts as the maximum element in subsequences with it and any subset of elements to its left (`2^i` subsequences).
     - It acts as the minimum element in subsequences with it and any subset of elements to its right (`2^(n-i-1)` subsequences, where `n` is the length of the array).
3. Aggregate these contributions while maintaining modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Code

```python
def sumOfPower(nums):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    nums.sort()
    n = len(nums)
    
    pow_2 = [1] * n  # Precompute powers of 2 modulo MOD
    for i in range(1, n):
        pow_2[i] = pow_2[i-1] * 2 % MOD
    
    result = 0
    for i in range(n):
        max_contributions = nums[i] * pow_2[i] % MOD  # Contributions as max element
        min_contributions = nums[i] * pow_2[n-i-1] % MOD  # Contributions as min element
        result = (result + max_contributions - min_contributions) % MOD
    
    return result

# Example usage
nums = [1, 3, 2]
print(sumOfPower(nums))  # Output should be the sum of the power of all subsequences
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting the array:** `O(n log n)`
- **Precomputing powers of 2:** `O(n)`
- **Iterating through the sorted array to compute contributions:** `O(n)`

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`, and space complexity is `O(n)` due to the array storing powers of 2.
