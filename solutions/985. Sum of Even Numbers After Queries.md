title:  Sum of Even Numbers After Queries-out
permalink: /s985
---
You are given an integer array `A` and an array of queries `queries`.

For the `i`-th query `queries[i] = [val, index]`, you add `val` to `A[index]`. Then, you calculate the sum of the even values of `A`.

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the answer to the `i`-th query.

**Example:**
```
Input: A = [1,2,3,4], queries = [[1,0],[-3,1],[-4,0],[2,3]]
Output: [8,6,2,4]
Explanation: 
At the beginning, A = [1,2,3,4].
After adding 1 to A[0], A = [2,2,3,4], sum of even numbers = 2 + 2 + 4 = 8.
After adding -3 to A[1], A = [2,-1,3,4], sum of even numbers = 2 + 4 = 6.
After adding -4 to A[0], A = [-2,-1,3,4], sum of even numbers = -2 + 4 = 2.
After adding 2 to A[3], A = [-2,-1,3,6], sum of even numbers = -2 + 6 = 4.
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= A.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^4 <= A[i] <= 10^4`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^4 <= queries[i][0] <= 10^4`
- `0 <= queries[i][1] < A.length`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the elements of `A` or `queries` contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, based on the constraints.

2. **Do we need to handle invalid index positions?**
   - No, the index provided in queries will always be valid as per the constraints.

3. **Can `A` or `queries` be empty?**
   - No, `1 <= A.length`, `1 <= queries.length`.

### Strategy
1. **Initialization:**
   - Compute the initial sum of even numbers in the array `A`.
   
2. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query `[val, index]`, update `A[index]` by adding `val`.
   - Adjust the sum of even numbers based on whether the updated `A[index]` was or is even.
   
3. **Output Result:**
   - Store the result after each query and finally return the results.

### Time Complexity
- Initial computation of even sum: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of `A`.
- Processing each query: `O(1)`
- Total time complexity: `O(n + q)`, where `q` is the number of queries.

### Code
Here is an implementation of the strategy in Python:

```python
def sumEvenAfterQueries(A, queries):
    # Calculate the initial sum of all even numbers in A
    even_sum = sum(x for x in A if x % 2 == 0)
    
    # Result list to store the sum after each query
    result = []
    
    for val, index in queries:
        original_value = A[index]
        
        # If the original value at A[index] is even, subtract it from even_sum
        if original_value % 2 == 0:
            even_sum -= original_value
        
        # Update the value at A[index]
        A[index] += val
        new_value = A[index]
        
        # If the new value at A[index] is even, add it to even_sum
        if new_value % 2 == 0:
            even_sum += new_value
        
        # Append the current even_sum to the result list
        result.append(even_sum)
    
    return result

# Example usage
A = [1, 2, 3, 4]
queries = [[1,0],[-3,1],[-4,0],[2,3]]
print(sumEvenAfterQueries(A, queries))  # Output: [8, 6, 2, 4]
```

This code initializes the even sum, processes each query by adjusting the even sum based on the updated value, and finally collects the results for each query.
