title:  Even Odd Tree-out
permalink: /s1609
---
A binary tree is named Even-Odd if it meets the following conditions:

1. The root of the tree is at level 0, the next level is level 1, and so on.
2. For every even-indexed level, all nodes at that level have odd integer values in strictly increasing order (from left to right).
3. For every odd-indexed level, all nodes at that level have even integer values in strictly decreasing order (from left to right).

Given the root of a binary tree, return true if the binary tree is Even-Odd, otherwise return false.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Tree structure clarifications:** 
    - Can the tree contain negative integers? 
    - What are the constraints on the tree size? (These details help assess edge cases and performance concerns)
    
    **Response:** The problem typically involves non-negative integer values. Also, constraints will usually be such that the problem can be solved within reasonable time and space limits.
2. **Edge cases:** 
    - What if the input tree is empty? We should return `false` because an empty tree does not meet the definition.

### Strategy
1. Perform a level order traversal (also known as breadth-first search) to access nodes level by level.
2. For each level, keep track of whether the level index is even or odd.
3. Validate the conditions specified:
    - For even levels, check if all node values are odd and in strictly increasing order.
    - For odd levels, check if all node values are even and in strictly decreasing order.
4. If any condition fails at any level, return `false`.

### Code
```python
from collections import deque

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, x):
        self.val = x
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

def isEvenOddTree(root):
    if not root:
        return False

    level = 0
    queue = deque([root])

    while queue:
        level_size = len(queue)
        prev_value = None

        for i in range(level_size):
            node = queue.popleft()
            
            if level % 2 == 0:
                # Even level: values should be odd and strictly increasing
                if node.val % 2 == 0 or (prev_value is not None and node.val <= prev_value):
                    return False
            else:
                # Odd level: values should be even and strictly decreasing
                if node.val % 2 == 1 or (prev_value is not None and node.val >= prev_value):
                    return False

            prev_value = node.val

            if node.left:
                queue.append(node.left)
            if node.right:
                queue.append(node.right)

        level += 1

    return True
```

### Time Complexity
- The algorithm performs a level order traversal of the binary tree. Each node is visited exactly once.
- Hence, the overall time complexity is \( O(N) \), where \( N \) is the number of nodes in the tree.

### Space Complexity
- The worst-case space complexity is \( O(M) \), where \( M \) is the maximum number of nodes at any level in the binary tree. This is due to storing the nodes of the current level in the `queue`.

This concludes the strategy and implementation for checking whether a binary tree is an Even-Odd Tree.
