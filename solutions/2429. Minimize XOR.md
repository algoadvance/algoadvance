title:  Minimize XOR-out
permalink: /s2429
---

You are given two integers `num1` and `num2`. You must determine the number of 1-bit set in the binary representation of `num2` and set the same number of 1-bits in the binary representation of `num1` such that the integer represented by this new binary representation is minimized.

Return the minimum possible XOR-out of the modified `num1`.

**Example:**
```
Input: num1 = 3, num2 = 5
Output: 3
```

In this case, the binary representation of `num2` has 2 set bits (since 5 is `101` in binary, which has 2 '1's). To make `num1` minimized while maintaining exactly 2 set bits, the smallest number we can form from `num1` is 3 (which, in binary, is `11`).

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are both `num1` and `num2` guaranteed to be non-negative integers?
   **A:** Yes, all given integers in this problem are non-negative.
  
2. **Q:** Is there a constraint on the maximum value of `num1` and `num2`?
   **A:** The typical constraint for LeetCode integer problems applies. It generally means `num1` and `num2` are within the 32-bit signed integer range.

## Strategy

1. **Count Bits in `num2`:**
   - Use Python's built-in functions to count the number of 1-bits (`set bits`) in `num2`.

2. **Duplicate Set Bits in `num1`:**
   - Generate the smallest number that has exactly the same number of set bits as in `num2`.
   - Start from the least significant bit of `num1` and set bits in this fashion until the count of set bits equals the count from `num2`.

3. **Set Remaining Bits if Needed:**
   - If `num1` has fewer set bits than required, set the leading bits until the required total number of set bits is achieved.

4. **Compute the Minimal Result:**
   - Ensure the resultant number is minimal by prioritizing setting the least significant bits first.

## Code

```python
def minimizeXor(num1: int, num2: int) -> int:
    # Count the number of 1-bits in num2
    count_bits_num2 = bin(num2).count('1')
    
    # Create a mask that will help us set the bits directly
    result = 0
    for i in range(31, -1, -1):
        if count_bits_num2 == 0:
            break
        if (num1 & (1 << i)) != 0:
            result |= (1 << i)
            count_bits_num2 -= 1
    
    for i in range(32):
        if count_bits_num2 == 0:
            break
        if (num1 & (1 << i)) == 0:
            result |= (1 << i)
            count_bits_num2 -= 1
    
    return result

# Example usage
print(minimizeXor(3, 5))  # Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity

- Counting bits in `num2`: `O(1)` since itâ€™s a simple bitwise operation bounded by the fixed size of integers.
- Setting bits in the result: `O(32)` which is again `O(1)` in the context of fixed-size 32-bit integers.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(1)`, making the solution very efficient.
