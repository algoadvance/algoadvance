title:  Find the Length of the Longest Common Prefix-out
permalink: /s3043
---

Given an array of strings `strs`, write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

Example:
- Input: `strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]`
- Output: `"fl"`

- Input: `strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]`
- Output: `""`

## Clarifying Questions

1. What should be returned if the input list is empty?
   - Return an empty string `""`.

2. Are the strings composed of only lowercase English letters?
   - Yes, assume that the strings consist of lowercase English letters.

Now let’s dive into the code.

## Code

### Function Signature
```python
def longest_common_prefix(strs: list) -> str:
    # Base case: if the list is empty, return an empty string
    if not strs:
        return "" 
    
    # Sort the array to get the smallest and largest items
    strs.sort()
    
    # Compare characters of the first and last items after sorting
    first, last = strs[0], strs[-1]
    i = 0
    while i < len(first) and i < len(last) and first[i] == last[i]:
        i += 1
        
    # The common prefix
    return first[:i]
```

### Strategy

1. **Base Case Check:**
   - If the list is empty, return an empty string immediately.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The strategy leverages sorting. By sorting the strings lexicographically, we can guarantee that the smallest and largest strings will provide the necessary comparison for finding the common prefix. This is because any common prefix must be a prefix of both the smallest and largest strings.

3. **Prefix Comparison:**
   - After sorting, compare the first and last strings character-by-character until a mismatch is found. The prefix up to the mismatch is the longest common prefix.

4. **Return Result:**
   - Return the common prefix derived from the comparison step.

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the array**: `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of strings.
- **Comparing the first and last string**: `O(m)`, where `m` is the length of the smallest string in the array.

Overall, the function’s time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it `O(n log n)`.

Let’s see the complete implementation:

```python
def longest_common_prefix(strs: list) -> str:
    if not strs:
        return ""
    
    strs.sort()
    first, last = strs[0], strs[-1]
    i = 0
    while i < len(first) and i < len(last) and first[i] == last[i]:
        i += 1
    return first[:i]

# Example usage:
print(longest_common_prefix(["flower", "flow", "flight"]))  # Output: "fl"
print(longest_common_prefix(["dog", "racecar", "car"]))     # Output: ""
```

This approach ensures that you get the desired result efficiently.
