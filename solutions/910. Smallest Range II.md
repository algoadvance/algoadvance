title:  Smallest Range II-out
permalink: /s910
---

Given an array `A` of integers, consider the difference between the largest and smallest value of `A`. We define the transformation `A[i] = A[i] + K` or `A[i] = A[i] - K` for all elements in the array. Return the smallest possible difference between the largest and smallest value of `A` after applying this transformation.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: A = [1], K = 0
Output: 0
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: A = [0,10], K = 2
Output: 6
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: A = [1,3,6], K = 3
Output: 3
```

**Note:**
1. `1 <= A.length <= 10000`
2. `0 <= A[i] <= 10000`
3. `0 <= K <= 10000`

### Clarifying Questions

1. Should the transformation be applied exactly once to each element of the array?
   - Yes, each element should be either increased or decreased by K exactly once.
   
2. What is the expected type of input and output?
   - The input is an array of integers `A` and an integer `K`, and the output is an integer representing the smallest possible difference.

3. Do we need to maintain the original sequence of `A`?
   - No, the sequence does not matter; we only need to find the smallest possible range.

### Strategy

1. First, sort the array `A`. This helps in minimizing the difference range calculation.
2. Transform the smallest element with `+K` and the largest element with `-K`. This considers the extreme transformations.
3. Note that the overall range difference might include intermediate values, so we compute difference ranges between the current smallest (`min(A[i] - K, A[0] + K)`) and largest (`max(A[i - 1] + K, A[-1] - K)`).
4. Iterate through possible division points in the sorted array to calculate the minimal range.

### Code

```python
def smallestRangeII(A, K):
    A.sort()
    n = len(A)
    result = A[-1] - A[0]

    for i in range(n - 1):
        high = max(A[-1] - K, A[i] + K)
        low = min(A[0] + K, A[i + 1] - K)
        result = min(result, high - low)
        
    return result

# Example usage
A1 = [1]
K1 = 0
print(smallestRangeII(A1, K1))  # Output: 0

A2 = [0, 10]
K2 = 2
print(smallestRangeII(A2, K2))  # Output: 6

A3 = [1, 3, 6]
K3 = 3
print(smallestRangeII(A3, K3))  # Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the array takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- Iterating through the array and calculating possible ranges takes \(O(n)\).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as we only use a fixed amount of extra space.
