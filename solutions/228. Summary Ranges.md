title:  Summary Ranges-out

Given a sorted integer array `nums`, return the smallest sorted list of ranges that cover all the numbers in the array exactly. That is, each element of `nums` is covered by exactly one of the ranges, and there is no integer `x` such that `x` is in one of the ranges but not in `nums`.

Each range `[a,b]` in the list should be output as:
* "a->b" if `a` != `b`
* "a" if `a` == `b`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Does the array contain duplicates?**
   - No, the array does not contain duplicate numbers as it is sorted and covers all the numbers exactly.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the size of the input array?**
   - The problem statement doesn't specify the size constraints, so we should assume the general case.

3. **What to return if the array is empty?**
   - If the array is empty, we should return an empty list.

### Code
```python
def summaryRanges(nums):
    ranges = []
    if not nums:
        return ranges

    start = nums[0]
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        # Check if the current number is not consecutive
        if nums[i] != nums[i-1] + 1:
            # If the start number is the same as the previous number
            if start == nums[i-1]:
                ranges.append(f"{start}")
            else:
                ranges.append(f"{start}->{nums[i-1]}")
            # Update the start to the current number
            start = nums[i]

    # Handle the last range
    if start == nums[-1]:
        ranges.append(f"{start}")
    else:
        ranges.append(f"{start}->{nums[-1]}")
    
    return ranges

# Example usage:
nums = [0,1,2,4,5,7]
print(summaryRanges(nums)) # Output: ["0->2", "4->5", "7"]

nums = [0,2,3,4,6,8,9]
print(summaryRanges(nums)) # Output: ["0", "2->4", "6", "8->9"]
```

### Strategy
1. **Initialization:** Create an empty list `ranges` to store the result.
2. **Edge Case:** If the input list `nums` is empty, return the empty list.
3. **Iteration:** Iterate through the list starting from the second element:
   - If the current element is not consecutive with the previous one, determine the range based on `start` and the previous number.
   - Append the determined range to the `ranges` list.
   - Update the `start` to the current number.
4. **Final Range:** After the loop, ensure that the last number or range is added to the `ranges` list.
5. **Return the list of ranges.**

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the input array `nums`. This is because we are iterating through the list once, performing constant-time operations within the loop.
