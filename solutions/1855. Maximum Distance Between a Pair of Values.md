title:  Maximum Distance Between a Pair of Values-out
permalink: /s1855
---
You are given two non-increasing 0-indexed integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`.

A pair of indices `(i, j)` is valid if:
- `0 <= i < nums1.length`
- `0 <= j < nums2.length`
- `i <= j` and `nums1[i] <= nums2[j]`

The task is to return the maximum distance `j - i` among all valid pairs `(i, j)`. If there are no valid pairs, return `0`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Are the arrays sorted in non-increasing order?**
   - Yes, both `nums1` and `nums2` are sorted in non-increasing order.
2. **What is the size range for the arrays?**
   - `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 10^5`
3. **Can the arrays have negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the arrays can contain negative numbers, as long as they are within the given constraints.

### Strategy:
1. **Pointers Approach:**
   - Use two pointers to traverse `nums1` and `nums2`. Let `i` point to indices in `nums1` and `j` point to indices in `nums2`.
   - Initialize `i` and `j` both to 0.
   - While `i < len(nums1)` and `j < len(nums2)`:
     - If the current pair `(i, j)` is valid (`nums1[i] <= nums2[j]`), calculate the distance `j - i` and update the maximum distance.
     - Regardless of whether the pair is valid, always move `j` to the next position.
     - If the pair is not valid, increment `i` to try the next element in `nums1`, while keeping `j` fixed.
2. Continue this process until you have exhausted either of the arrays.

### Code:
```python
def maxDistance(nums1, nums2):
    i, j = 0, 0
    max_dist = 0

    while i < len(nums1) and j < len(nums2):
        if nums1[i] <= nums2[j]:
            max_dist = max(max_dist, j - i)
            j += 1
        else:
            i += 1

    return max_dist
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n + m), where `n` is the length of `nums1` and `m` is the length of `nums2`. In the worst case, both pointers traverse their respective arrays once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

This algorithm efficiently finds the maximum valid distance by leveraging the sorted property of the arrays and the two-pointer technique to avoid unnecessary traversals.
