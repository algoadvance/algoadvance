title:  Sum of All Subset XOR Totals-out
permalink: /s1863
---

Given an integer array `nums`, return the sum of all XOR totals for every subset of `nums`. The XOR total of an array is defined as the bitwise XOR of all its elements, and the XOR total of the empty subset is 0.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on Input Size**: 
   - What is the maximum length of the array `nums`?
   - What is the range of values for each element in `nums`?

2. **Return Value**: 
   - Should the solution handle large sums, or are there any constraints on the sum value?

### Strategy

We need to consider all subsets of the array `nums` and calculate the XOR for each subset. The sum of these XOR values will be our answer.

1. **Generate Subsets**: 
   We'll use the power set approach to generate all subsets of `nums`. Each element can either be in a subset or not, leading to `2^n` subsets for an array of length `n`.

2. **XOR Calculation**: 
   For each subset, calculate the XOR of its elements.

3. **Sum the XOR Values**: 
   Sum all the XOR values obtained for each subset.

To efficiently generate subsets and handle XOR calculations, we can use backtracking.

### Code

```python
def subsetXORSum(nums):
    def backtrack(start, current_xor):
        nonlocal total_sum
        total_sum += current_xor
        
        for i in range(start, len(nums)):
            backtrack(i + 1, current_xor ^ nums[i])

    total_sum = 0
    backtrack(0, 0)
    
    return total_sum

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 3]
print(subsetXORSum(nums))  # Output: 6
```

### Explanation

1. **Backtrack Function (Recursive)**:
   - `start`: Index to start from for generating subsets.
   - `current_xor`: Current XOR value of the subset being generated.
   - For each function call, add the `current_xor` to the `total_sum`.

2. **Recursive Call**:
   - Iterate from the current `start` index to the length of `nums`.
   - For each index, calculate the new XOR by including `nums[i]` and recursively call `backtrack`.

3. **Initial Call**:
   - Initialize `total_sum` to 0.
   - Start the backtracking process from index 0 with `current_xor` as 0.

### Time Complexity

The algorithm's complexity can be broken down as follows:
- **Generating Subsets**: There are `2^n` subsets for an array of length `n`.
- **XOR Calculation**: Each subset can take up to `O(n)` time to calculate the XOR.

So, the worst-case time complexity is `O(n * 2^n)`.

This approach is efficient for small to moderately sized arrays but may become infeasible for large `n` due to the exponential growth of subsets.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently generates all possible subsets and calculates the XOR sum needed while maintaining manageable complexity for reasonable input sizes.
