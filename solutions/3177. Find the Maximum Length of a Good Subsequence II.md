title:  Find the Maximum Length of a Good Subsequence II-out
permalink: /s3177
---

You are given a string `s` consisting of only 'a', 'b', or 'c'. A subsequence of `s` is called a good subsequence if it satisfies the following conditions:
- The subsequence contains exactly `count` occurrences of 'a'.
- The subsequence contains exactly `count` occurrences of 'b'.
- The subsequence contains exactly `count` occurrences of 'c'.

Find the maximum possible length of such a good subsequence.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the length range of string `s`?
   - Does `s` contain only lowercase letters 'a', 'b', 'c'?

2. **Output Specifications**:
   - Should the function return the length of the maximum good subsequence?
   - Is the result always expected to be in integer value?

Given the problem, let's assume:
- The length of `s` can be up to `10^5`.
- The string `s` contains only 'a', 'b', or 'c'.

### Strategy

1. **Count Occurrences**: First, count the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c' in the string.
2. **Determine the `count`**: The value of `count` defined by the problem would be the minimum count of 'a', 'b', or 'c' in the string since each 'good subsequence' must contain the same number of 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
3. **Calculate the Length**: The maximum length of the good subsequence would be `3 * count` because each good subsequence has an equal number of 'a', 'b', and 'c'.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the above strategy:

```python
def maxGoodSubsequenceLength(s: str) -> int:
    # Step 1: Count occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c'
    a_count = s.count('a')
    b_count = s.count('b')
    c_count = s.count('c')
    
    # Step 2: Determine the minimum count
    min_count = min(a_count, b_count, c_count)
    
    # Step 3: Calculate the maximum length of the good subsequence
    return 3 * min_count

# Example usage
s = "abcabc"
print(maxGoodSubsequenceLength(s))  # Output: 6
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The main operations are counting the occurrences of 'a', 'b', and 'c', each of which runs in O(n) time complexity where `n` is the length of the string. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n).
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of additional space.

This solution is efficient and should perform well within the given constraints.
