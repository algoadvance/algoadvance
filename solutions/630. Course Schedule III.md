title:  Course Schedule III-out
permalink: /s630
---
You are given an array of courses where `courses[i] = [duration_i, lastDay_i]` indicates that the `i`-th course should be taken continuously for `duration_i` days and must be finished before or on `lastDay_i`. You can start a new course only after finishing the previous one.

You will start with no courses attended and wish to take as many courses as possible. Return the maximum number of courses that you can take.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Does the order of courses in the input matter?
   - No, we can take the courses in any order, as long as we respect the `lastDay` constraints.
   
2. Are the durations and last days always positive integers?
   - Yes, the problem statement implies that durations and last days are positive integers.

3. What is the range of `n` (number of courses)?
   - Based on common constraints in such problems, let's assume `1 <= n <= 10^4`, but this can vary.

### Strategy
1. **Sorting by Last Day**:
   - Sort courses based on their `lastDay`. This ensures that we consider courses which need to be finished earlier first.

2. **Using a Max-Heap**:
   - Use a max-heap to keep track of the durations of the selected courses. The heap helps in efficiently managing the course with the longest duration that can be replaced if needed.
   - If adding a new course exceeds the `totalTime` beyond the course’s `lastDay`, pop the course with the largest duration from the heap. This helps in accommodating more courses by replacing longer duration courses with shorter or more fitting ones.

### Code
```python
import heapq

def scheduleCourse(courses):
    # Sort courses by their lastDay
    courses.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    total_time = 0
    max_heap = []
    
    for duration, last_day in courses:
        heapq.heappush(max_heap, -duration)
        total_time += duration
        
        # Check if the total time exceeds the lastDay
        if total_time > last_day:
            # Remove the course with the longest duration
            total_time += heapq.heappop(max_heap)
    
    return len(max_heap)
```

### Explanation
1. **Sorting Courses**:
   - `courses.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])`: Sort courses by their `lastDay` in ascending order.

2. **Iterating and Managing Heap**:
   - `heapq.heappush(max_heap, -duration)`: Push the negative duration into `max_heap` to simulate a max-heap using Python’s min-heap.
   - `total_time += duration`: Keep adding durations to the `total_time`.
   - **Checking Constraint**:
     - If `total_time` exceeds `last_day`, remove the course with the longest duration to make space (`total_time += heapq.heappop(max_heap)`).

3. **Result**:
   - The number of courses in the `max_heap` will be the maximum number of courses that you can take.

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Heap Operations**: Each insertion and removal in the heap takes \(O(\log n)\), and potentially all `n` elements could be added and removed, leading to \(O(n \log n)\) in total.
- **Overall**: The total time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

This solution effectively balances the total course durations while adhering to the constraints given by the `lastDay` of each course, allowing for a maximum number of courses to be taken.
