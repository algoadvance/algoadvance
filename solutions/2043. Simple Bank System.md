Design a simple bank system that supports the following operations:

1. **Create a bank account with an initial balance**.
2. **Deposit money into the account**.
3. **Withdraw money from the account**.
4. **Transfer money from one account to another**

You need to implement the `Bank` class:

```python
class Bank:
    def __init__(self, balance: List[int]):
        pass

    def transfer(self, account1: int, account2: int, money: int) -> bool:
        pass
    
    def deposit(self, account: int, money: int) -> bool:
        pass
    
    def withdraw(self, account: int, money: int) -> bool:
        pass
```

The `Bank` class should include the following methods:

- **`__init__(self, balance: List[int])`**: Takes an array `balance` where `balance[i]` is the initial balance of the `(i+1)`-th account.
  
- **`transfer(self, account1: int, account2: int, money: int) -> bool`**:
  Transfers money from account `account1` to account `account2`. Returns `True` if the transfer was successful, otherwise returns `False`.
  
- **`deposit(self, account: int, money: int) -> bool`**:
  Deposits money into the specified account. Returns `True` if the deposit was successful, otherwise returns `False`.

- **`withdraw(self, account: int, money: int) -> bool`**:
  Withdraws money from the specified account. Returns `True` if the withdrawal was successful, otherwise returns `False`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are there any constraints on the number of accounts or the initial balance?
2. Should the operations validate the existence of an account before processing the transaction?
3. Are there constraints on the amounts of money (e.g., integer only)?

### Plan and Strategy

1. **Initialization (`__init__`)**:
   - Store the balances in a list where the index represents the account number minus one.

2. **Transfer Operation**:
   - Check if both accounts exist and if `account1` has enough balance.
   - If valid, subtract the amount from `account1` and add it to `account2`.
   - Return `True` if successful, otherwise `False`.

3. **Deposit Operation**:
   - Check if the account exists.
   - If valid, add the amount to the account balance.
   - Return `True` if successful, otherwise `False`.

4. **Withdraw Operation**:
   - Check if the account exists and if it has enough balance.
   - If valid, subtract the amount from the account balance.
   - Return `True` if successful, otherwise `False`.

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: O(1), as we're only assigning the given balances array to an instance variable.
- **Transfer**: O(1), as we are just checking conditions and updating balances.
- **Deposit**: O(1), as we are only updating the balance.
- **Withdraw**: O(1), as we are only checking and updating the balance.

### Code

```python
from typing import List

class Bank:
    def __init__(self, balance: List[int]):
        self.balance = balance
    
    def transfer(self, account1: int, account2: int, money: int) -> bool:
        if 1 <= account1 <= len(self.balance) and 1 <= account2 <= len(self.balance):
            if self.balance[account1 - 1] >= money:
                self.balance[account1 - 1] -= money
                self.balance[account2 - 1] += money
                return True
        return False
    
    def deposit(self, account: int, money: int) -> bool:
        if 1 <= account <= len(self.balance):
            self.balance[account - 1] += money
            return True
        return False
    
    def withdraw(self, account: int, money: int) -> bool:
        if 1 <= account <= len(self.balance):
            if self.balance[account - 1] >= money:
                self.balance[account - 1] -= money
                return True
        return False
```

This code effectively implements the simple banking system as per the requirements. Each operation checks the necessary conditions before proceeding to ensure the validity of the transactions.
