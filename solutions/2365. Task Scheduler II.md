You are given a strictly increasing integer array `tasks` of length `n` and a positive integer `space`. Each `tasks[i]` represents the start time of the i-th task. You can perform multiple tasks concurrently, but there are constraints:

- If you perform a task, you must wait for at least `space` amount of time before you start another task (including the same task).

Return the minimum possible time for you to finish all given tasks.

**Example:**

```python
Input: tasks = [1, 3, 6], space = 2
Output: 6

Explanation:
- Perform the first task at the start time of 1.
- Perform the third task at the start time of 6.
- Perform the second task at any time between the 3+2=5 and can be finished at the end time 6.

So the earliest can finish the task is at time 6.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is `tasks` guaranteed to be a strictly increasing integer array?**
   - Yes, it is mentioned in the problem statement.
   
2. **Can any task start precisely when another finishes or exactly after `space` units of time?**
   - Yes, tasks can be started precisely after `space` units of time from the previous task.

3. **What is the range of integers in `tasks` and the value of `space`?**
   - The problem statement does not specify, but we can assume they are within reasonable bounds suitable for an algorithm more efficient than O(n^2).

## Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - We maintain a dictionary `last_time_task_performed` to keep track of the last time a task was performed.
   - Keep a `current_time` initialized to 0, which represents the current temporal point we are at.

2. **Iterate through tasks:**
   - For each task start time `t`, if you can start the task at `t`, update `current_time` to `t`.
   - If not, wait until you can start the task following the `space` requirement, updating the last time the task was performed in the dictionary and adjusting `current_time`.

3. **Update last time performed**:
   - After performing a task, update the dictionary to reflect the last time this task was performed as `current_time`.

4. **Return `current_time`:**
   - After iterating through all tasks, `current_time` will reflect the minimum possible time to finish all the tasks.

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the `tasks` array, as we are processing each task exactly once.

## Code

```python
def task_scheduler_ii(tasks, space):
    last_time_task_performed = {}
    current_time = 0
    
    for t in tasks:
        if t in last_time_task_performed:
            if current_time < last_time_task_performed[t] + space:
                current_time = last_time_task_performed[t] + space + 1
            else:
                current_time = t
        else:
            current_time = t
            
        last_time_task_performed[t] = current_time
    
    return current_time

# Example usage:
print(task_scheduler_ii([1, 3, 6], 2))  # Output: 6
```

This solution correctly computes the minimum possible time we can finish all tasks given the constraints, by carefully tracking the last start time for each task and ensuring the space requirement is adhered to.
