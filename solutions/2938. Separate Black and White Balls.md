title:  Separate Black and White Balls-out
permalink: /s2938
---

You are given an array of non-negative integers where each integer represents the number of white balls in that position. The goal is to organize these balls in such a way that all the white balls are together and any positions with 0 values are filled in with black balls to the left and right of the white balls. The function should return the new array with the white balls grouped together and black balls (zeroes) appropriately placed.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are zeroes the only representation for black balls and any positive integer for white balls?
   - Yes, according to the problem statement black balls are represented by `0` and white balls are represented by any non-zero integer.
   
2. Should the relative order of the white balls be preserved in the output?
   - Yes, the relative order of the white balls should be maintained in the output.

3. What should be the expected output if the input array is empty?
   - The output should also be an empty array if the input array is empty.

4. Are there any constraints on input array size?
   - Assume the length of the array is reasonable and can fit in memory. For this problem, we'll assume a typical constraint like `1 <= len(array) <= 10^5`.

Let's proceed to solve this problem step-by-step.

### Strategy

1. Traverse the given array and collect all the non-zero elements (white balls).
2. Compute the number of zero elements (black balls) by subtracting the number of white balls from the total length of the array.
3. Construct a new array with all the collected white balls in the middle and zero elements on both sides.

### Code

```python
def separate_balls(arr):
    # Collect all non-zero elements (white balls)
    white_balls = [ball for ball in arr if ball != 0]
    
    # Calculate the number of black balls (zeroes)
    num_black_balls = len(arr) - len(white_balls)
    
    # Construct the new array with white balls in the middle
    black_balls_left = [0] * (num_black_balls // 2)
    black_balls_right = [0] * (num_black_balls - len(black_balls_left))
    
    return black_balls_left + white_balls + black_balls_right

# Example usage:
# Input: [0, 2, 0, 5, 0, 7, 0]
# Output: [0, 0, 2, 5, 7, 0, 0]
print(separate_balls([0, 2, 0, 5, 0, 7, 0]))
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - Traversing the list to collect the non-zero elements takes O(n) time.
  - Constructing the new list from the collected elements and the zeroes takes O(n) time.
  - Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n).
  
- **Space Complexity**: 
  - The space complexity is O(n) since we use additional space to store the new array of the same length as the input array.
