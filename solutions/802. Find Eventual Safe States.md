title:  Find Eventual Safe States-out
permalink: /s802
---

You are given a directed graph of `n` nodes represented by an adjacency list, where `graph[i]` is a list of nodes that node `i` has edges to. A node is considered safe if and only if every possible path starting from that node leads to a terminal node (i.e., a node that has no outgoing edges). Return an array containing all the safe nodes of the graph. The answer should be sorted in ascending order.

**Example:**

```
Input: graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
Output: [2,4,5,6]

Explanation:
Node 5 and 6 are terminal nodes.
Node 2 and 4 lead to terminal nodes.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Can the graph contain cycles?** 
    - A: Yes, the graph can contain cycles.

2. **Q: What is the range of the number of nodes `n`?**
    - A: Typically constraints for such problems are `1 <= n <= 10^4`.

3. **Q: Are there any duplicate edges in the graph?**
    - A: No, each edge is unique.

4. **Q: Can the graph be disconnected?**
    - A: Yes, the graph can be disconnected.

### Strategy

To identify eventual safe nodes:
1. **Reverse Graph**: Construct the reverse graph where each edge `(u, v)` in the original graph becomes `(v, u)`.
2. **Track Outbound Edges**: Track the number of outgoing edges for each node in the original graph.
3. **Queue Initialization**: Initialize a queue with all terminal nodes (nodes with zero outgoing edges in the original graph).
4. **Process the Queue**:
    - Remove nodes from the queue one by one.
    - Reduce the outgoing edge count for each predecessor of the current node (according to the reverse graph).
    - If any predecessor now has zero outgoing edges, add it to the queue.
5. **Collect Safe Nodes**: Nodes that have been processed (those that have no remaining edges) are the safe nodes.
6. **Sort**: Sort the safe nodes before returning.

### Code

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

def eventualSafeNodes(graph):
    n = len(graph)
    
    # Reverse graph adjacency list
    reverse_graph = defaultdict(list)
    
    # Count of outbound edges for each node
    outbound_count = [0] * n
    
    for node, neighbors in enumerate(graph):
        outbound_count[node] = len(neighbors)
        for neighbor in neighbors:
            reverse_graph[neighbor].append(node)
    
    # Queue initialization with terminal nodes (nodes with 0 outbound edges)
    queue = deque([node for node, count in enumerate(outbound_count) if count == 0])
    safe_nodes = []
    
    while queue:
        current_node = queue.popleft()
        safe_nodes.append(current_node)  # Safe node found
        
        for predecessor in reverse_graph[current_node]:
            outbound_count[predecessor] -= 1  # Reduce outbound edges count
            if outbound_count[predecessor] == 0:
                queue.append(predecessor)  # Add new terminal node to the queue
    
    return sorted(safe_nodes)

# Test the function with an example input
graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
print(eventualSafeNodes(graph))  # Output: [2, 4, 5, 6]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Reverse Graph Construction**: `O(V + E)` where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
- **Processing Queue**: Each node and edge is processed at most once resulting in `O(V + E)` operations.
- **Sorting the result**: `O(V log V)` for sorting the nodes.

**Total Time Complexity**: `O(V + E + V log V)` which simplifies to `O(V log V + E)`.
