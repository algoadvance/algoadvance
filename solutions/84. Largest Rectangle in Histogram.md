title:  Largest Rectangle in Histogram-out
permalink: /s84
---
Given an array of integers `heights` representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is 1, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **What is the range of the input list `heights`?**
   - The length of `heights` can go up to 10^5.

2. **What are the possible values in the `heights` list?**
   - Each height can range between 0 and 10^4.

3. **Can the `heights` list be empty?**
   - Yes, if the `heights` list is empty, the largest rectangle area should be `0`.

4. **What should the function return if all heights are zero?**
   - If all heights are zero, the largest rectangle area should also be `0`.

## Strategy:
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a stack to keep track of the indices of the histogram bars. The stack helps us quickly find the width of the rectangle when we encounter a bar that is shorter than the bar at the index stored at the top of the stack.

Here's the algorithm:
1. Initialize an empty stack `stack` and a variable `max_area` to store the maximum area.
2. Iterate through the `heights` array.
3. If the current bar is higher than the bar at the index stored at the top of the stack, push the current index to the stack.
4. If the current bar is lower, pop indices from the stack and calculate the area for each popped index until the stack is empty or the bar at the index stored at the top of the stack is less than or equal to the current bar.
5. To handle the remaining bars in the stack (bars that haven't found a bar shorter than themselves), continue calculating the area until the stack is empty.
6. Return the `max_area`.

### Time Complexity:
The algorithm runs in O(n) time because each bar is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.

Here is the implementation of the above strategy:

```python
def largestRectangleArea(heights):
    stack = []
    max_area = 0
    index = 0
    
    while index < len(heights):
        # If this bar is higher than the bar at stack top, push it to the stack
        if not stack or heights[index] >= heights[stack[-1]]:
            stack.append(index)
            index += 1
        else:
            # Pop the top
            top_of_stack = stack.pop()
            # Calculate the area with heights[top_of_stack] as the smallest (or minimum height) bar 'h'
            area = (heights[top_of_stack] *
                    ((index - stack[-1] - 1) if stack else index))
            # Update max_area, if needed
            max_area = max(max_area, area)
    
    # Now, pop the remaining bars from stack and calculate area
    while stack:
        top_of_stack = stack.pop()
        area = (heights[top_of_stack] *
                ((index - stack[-1] - 1) if stack else index))
        max_area = max(max_area, area)
    
    return max_area
```

This code should efficiently compute the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram given the heights of the bars.
