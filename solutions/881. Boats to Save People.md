title:  Boats to Save People-out
permalink: /s881
---

You are given an array `people` where `people[i]` is the weight of the ith person, and an integer `limit` representing the weight limit of a boat. Each boat can carry at most two people at the same time, provided the sum of the weights of those people is at most `limit`.

Return the minimum number of boats to carry every person.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Are the number of people, N, and the weights always positive integers?
   - **A**: Yes, N and weights are positive integers.
2. **Q**: Can a person be placed in multiple boats?
   - **A**: No, each person must be carried exactly once.
3. **Q**: What to do if a single person's weight is greater than the limit?
   - **A**: According to the problem constraints, this edge case should not occur. Every person's weight will be at most equal to the `limit`.

### Strategy

The problem can be effectively solved using a two-pointer technique combined with sorting:
1. Sort the array `people` to organize the weights.
2. Use two pointers, one starting from the lightest person (`left` at index 0) and the other from the heaviest person (`right` at index `len(people) - 1`).
3. Check if the lightest and heaviest person can share a boat (i.e., if their combined weight is less than or equal to `limit`). If they can, move both pointers inward; if they can't, move only the `right` pointer inward as the heaviest person will need a separate boat.
4. Continue this process until all people are assigned to boats.
5. The number of moves made corresponds to the number of boats required.

### Code

```python
def numRescueBoats(people, limit):
    people.sort()
    left, right = 0, len(people) - 1
    boats = 0
    
    while left <= right:
        if people[left] + people[right] <= limit:
            left += 1  # This person can share the boat
        right -= 1
        boats += 1  # A boat is used
    
    return boats
```

### Explanation

1. **Sorting**: The `people` array is sorted, which helps easily pair the lightest and heaviest people.
2. **Two Pointers**: The `left` pointer starts at the beginning (lightest person) and the `right` pointer starts at the end (heaviest person).
3. **Check and Move Pointers**: 
   - If the sum of weights at `left` and `right` is within the boat limit, increment the `left` pointer (indicating this person is on the boat).
   - Always decrement the `right` pointer (indicating the heaviest person is accounted for).
4. **Boats Count**: Increment the `boats` count for each valid operation (moving in the pointers).

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting**: O(N log N)
2. **Two-Pointer Scan**: O(N)

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(N log N)** due to the sorting step. The two-pointer scan is linear in complexity afterward, which is efficient for most practical input sizes.
