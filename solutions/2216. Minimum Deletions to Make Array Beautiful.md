title:  Minimum Deletions to Make Array Beautiful-out
permalink: /s2216
---

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. The array `nums` is considered beautiful if:

- `nums.length` is even.
- For every even index `i`, `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]`.

In one operation, you can delete any element from `nums`. Return the minimum number of deletions needed to make `nums` beautiful. An array is empty after deleting all elements.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `nums` be an empty array or contain only one element?**
   - `nums` can be empty or contain one element. If it is empty or has only one element, the result should be 0 because there's no need for deletions to make it beautiful.
  
2. **What are the constraints on the array elements' values?**
   - The constraints include `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5` and `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`.

3. **Is there a possibility of multiple correct answers?**
   - Yes, but we are required to find the minimum number of deletions.

### Strategy

Our goal is to make every even indexed element distinct from the subsequent odd indexed element to make the array `beautiful`. Here's a step-by-step strategy:

1. **Initial Check**: If the input `nums` is empty or has only one element, return 0 since no deletions are needed.
2. **Iterate Through the Array**: Iterate through the array, checking pairs of elements with indices `[i, i+1]`:
   - If the pair (`nums[i]`, `nums[i+1]`) violates the condition where `nums[i] == nums[i+1]` and `i` is even, we need to consider breaking this condition:
     - Remove the element at `i+1` to reduce the number of violations.
   - Keep a counter to count the number of deletions.

### Code

```python
def min_deletions_to_make_beautiful(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    
    deletions = 0
    i = 0

    while i < len(nums) - 1:
        if i % 2 == 0 and nums[i] == nums[i + 1]:
            deletions += 1
            nums.pop(i + 1)
        else:
            i += 1
    
    # Adjusting for the even length.
    if len(nums) % 2 != 0:
        deletions += 1
    
    return deletions

# Example Usage:
print(min_deletions_to_make_beautiful([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3]))  # Example Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the `nums`. Each element is processed at most once due to the operations performed during iteration.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), because we are modifying the input list in place without extra space usage.

### Summary

This solution ensures that at least one minimum deletion operation is performed at each step to break the violation of the "beautiful" condition (where `nums[i] == nums[i+1]` for an even index `i`), while ensuring that the list still maintains even length by potentially adding one more deletion if the remaining length is odd.
