title:  Find the Punishment Number of an Integer-out
permalink: /s2698

You have been assigned a numerical punishment in a game. The punishment number for a given integer \( n \) is defined by a sequence of steps where you start with the number 1 and sum the squares of all natural numbers up to and including \( n \).

To state it formally, given an integer \( n \), you need to compute the punishment number defined as:

\[ P(n) = 1^2 + 2^2 + \ldots + n^2 \]

### Clarifying Questions

Before we proceed, let's clarify a few points:

1. **Input Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the value of \( n \)? This will help us understand if we need to handle very large inputs.
2. **Output**: Should the output be a single integer representing the punishment number?

### Strategy

To find the punishment number for an integer \( n \), we can use the formula for the sum of squares of the first \( n \) natural numbers, which is:

\[ P(n) = \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \]

This formula allows us to compute the punishment number in constant time \( O(1) \) rather than iterating through all numbers up to \( n \).

### Code

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
def punishment_number(n):
    return (n * (n + 1) * (2 * n + 1)) // 6

# Example Usage
n = 10
print(f"Punishment number for {n} is: {punishment_number(n)}")
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is \( O(1) \), which means it computes the punishment number in constant time regardless of the input size \( n \). This is efficient and optimal for this problem.

### Explanation

1. **Formula Derivation**: The formula used, \( \frac{n(n+1)(2n+1)}{6} \), is a well-known result in mathematics for the sum of squares of the first \( n \) natural numbers.
2. **Output**: The function `punishment_number` returns the computed punishment number for the given \( n \).

By leveraging this mathematical formula, we efficiently solve the problem without the need for iterative summation, ensuring optimal performance even for larger values of \( n \).
