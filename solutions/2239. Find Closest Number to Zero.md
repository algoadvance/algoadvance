title:  Find Closest Number to Zero-out
permalink: /s2239
---

Given an integer array `nums` of size `n`, find the number that is closest to zero. If there are multiple answers, return the number with the largest value.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**: What are the minimum and maximum possible sizes for the array `nums`?
2. **Value Range**: What are the minimum and maximum possible values for elements in `nums`?
3. **Edge Cases**: Can the array contain duplicate values? Can the array be empty?
4. **Output**: Should the function return an integer? What should it return if the array is empty?

### Code

Let's write the code, keeping in mind to handle edge cases as well.

```python
def findClosestNumber(nums):
    # Handle the case where nums is empty
    if not nums:
        return None  # Assuming returning None for an empty list

    # Initialize the closest number to a very large value
    closest_num = float('inf')
    
    for num in nums:
        # Check if this number is closer to zero than the closest_num found so far
        if abs(num) < abs(closest_num):
            closest_num = num
        # If it ties for closeness, choose the larger value
        elif abs(num) == abs(closest_num):
            closest_num = max(closest_num, num)
    
    return closest_num
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Start with `closest_num` set to positive infinity.
2. **Iterate through the Array**: For each number in `nums`, check the following:
   - If the absolute value of the current number is less than the absolute value of `closest_num`, update `closest_num`.
   - If the absolute values are equal, update `closest_num` to be the maximum of the current number and `closest_num`.
3. **Return Result**: After iterating through the array, return the `closest_num`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array `nums`. This is because we only iterate through the list once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), since we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
