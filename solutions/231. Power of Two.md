Given an integer `n`, write a function to determine if it is a power of two. A power of two is a number of the form \(2^x\) where `x` is an integer.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Range:** Are there any constraints on the input range for `n`?
   - Generally, `n` will be a 32-bit signed integer, so it can range from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.

2. **Edge Cases:** 
   - Should the function return `False` for non-positive numbers (0 and negative numbers)?
      - Yes, only positive powers of two are to be considered, so non-positive numbers should return `False`.

3. **Efficiency:** 
   - Does it need to be done in constant time?
      - A logarithmic or constant time solution is preferable.

### Strategy:
1. **Positive Check:**
   - First, we need to check whether `n` is positive. If it isnâ€™t, we should return `False`.

2. **Bit Manipulation:**
   - The most efficient way to check if a number is a power of two is through bit manipulation.
   - A power of two has exactly one bit set in its binary representation.
   - This property allows us to use the condition `(n & (n - 1)) == 0` to check for powers of two. This works because:
     - `(n - 1)` flips all bits after the rightmost set bit (including the set bit itself).
     - Performing an AND operation between `n` and `(n - 1)` should result in `0` if `n` is a power of two.

3. **Edge Cases Handling:**
   - If `n <= 0`, immediately return `False`.
   
### Code:
```python
def isPowerOfTwo(n: int) -> bool:
    if n <= 0:
        return False
    return (n & (n - 1)) == 0

# Test cases
print(isPowerOfTwo(1))   # True (2^0)
print(isPowerOfTwo(16))  # True (2^4)
print(isPowerOfTwo(218)) # False
print(isPowerOfTwo(1024))# True (2^10)
print(isPowerOfTwo(0))   # False
print(isPowerOfTwo(-4))  # False
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** O(1) 
  - The bit manipulation operation `(n & (n - 1))` is done in constant time.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - No extra space is used beyond a few variables.

This method is efficient and covers all edge cases as required.
