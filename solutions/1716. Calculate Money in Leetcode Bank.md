title:  Calculate Money in Leetcode Bank-out
permalink: /s1716

LeetCode problem `1716. Calculate Money in Leetcode Bank` requires you to calculate the amount of money in the Leetcode bank after `n` days. The rules for the bank deposits are as follows:

- You start with `$1` on Monday.
- Every day of the week, you deposit one more dollar than the previous day (i.e., `$2` on Tuesday, `$3` on Wednesday, and so on until `$7` on Sunday).
- Every Monday, you start with one more dollar than the previous Monday (i.e., `$(7 + 1)` for the second week, `$(7 + 2)` for the third week, etc.).

The goal is to return the total amount of money in the bank after `n` days.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What are the constraints on `n`?
   **A:** `1 <= n <= 1000`
   
2. **Q:** Are there any special cases to consider, such as `n` being a small number (like `1` or `7`)?
   **A:** Yes, handling small numbers should conform to the general rules applied for the problem.

### Strategy
1. **Weekly Calculation:**
   - Each week starts a new sequence, with the first Monday of week `i` having a deposit of `$i`.
   - The sequence for any week continues by incrementing the deposit amount by `$1` each subsequent day until Sunday.

2. **Summing the Weeks:**
   - Complete `weeks` are easy to calculate since they repeat periodically.
   - For remaining days in a partial week, simply continue the sequence from where the last full week left off.

### Code
```python
def totalMoney(n: int) -> int:
    # Full weeks
    full_weeks = n // 7
    # Remaining days after full weeks
    remaining_days = n % 7
    
    # Calculate money from complete weeks
    total_money = 0
    
    for week in range(full_weeks):
        # For week i (0-indexed), the deposits start from 1+week till 7+week
        total_money += sum(range(1 + week, 8 + week))
    
    # Calculate money from the remaining days
    start_day = 1 + full_weeks  # the day number in sequence after full_weeks weeks
    for day in range(remaining_days):
        total_money += start_day + day
    
    return total_money

# Example usage:
print(totalMoney(10))  # Expected output: 37
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is `O(1)` because the number of weeks (`n / 7`) is limited by the constraints, making the loop iterations constant time. Calculating the sums of each week and the remaining days is done with a finite number of operations independent of the input size `n`. Hence, the code performs efficiently even at the upper limit of constraints (i.e., `n = 1000`).
