title:  Apply Operations to Make Sum of Array Greater Than or Equal to k-out
permalink: /s3091
---

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You have a maximum of 3 operations that you can perform on the array elements. In a single operation, you can choose an index `i` such that `0 <= i < nums.length` and apply any one of the following changes:
1. Set `nums[i]` to `0`.
2. Double the value at `nums[i]`.
3. Increase `nums[i]` by `1`.

Your task is to determine if it is possible to make the sum of the array elements greater than or equal to `k` by applying at most 3 operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Are negative numbers allowed in the `nums` array?**
   - **A: Yes, the array can contain negative numbers.**

2. **Q: Do we need to consider the ordering of the operations?**
   - **A: Technically, yes, but we need to find the optimal sequence of operations that achieves the goal if possible.**

3. **Q: What should we return if it's not possible to achieve the sum `k`?**
   - **A: You should return `False` if it's not possible to achieve the sum `k` with at most 3 operations. Otherwise, return `True`.**

### Strategy

1. **Calculate Initial Sum**: Start by calculating the sum of the array `nums`.
2. **Check Initial Sum**: If the initial sum is already greater than or equal to `k`, return `True`.
3. **Consider Each Operation**:
    - Calculate the effect of setting an element to `0`, doubling an element, or incrementing an element by `1`.
    - Use a heuristic to apply the most beneficial operation (based on how much it increases the sum) at each step to try to meet or exceed `k`.
4. **Greedy Approach**: Use a greedy algorithm to apply up to 3 operations that provide the maximum sum increase.
5. **Backtracking**: Consider using backtracking to systematically try different combinations of operations if a straightforward greedy approach doesn't work.

### Code

Below is an implementation that follows the described strategy:

```python
def canAchieveSum(nums, k):
    def maximum_operations_gain(nums):
        # Collect all individual gains from three operations
        gains = []
        for i in range(len(nums)):
            set_to_zero_gain = -nums[i]
            double_value_gain = nums[i]
            increase_by_one_gain = 1
            gains.append((set_to_zero_gain, 'zero', i))
            gains.append((double_value_gain, 'double', i))
            gains.append((increase_by_one_gain, 'increment', i))
        return sorted(gains, key=lambda x: x[0], reverse=True)
    
    current_sum = sum(nums)
    if current_sum >= k:
        return True
    
    gains = maximum_operations_gain(nums)
    
    for _ in range(3):
        if not gains:
            break
        gain, operation, index = gains.pop(0)
        current_sum += gain
        if current_sum >= k:
            return True
        # Apply the operation to nums
        if operation == 'zero':
            nums[index] = 0
        elif operation == 'double':
            nums[index] *= 2
        elif operation == 'increment':
            nums[index] += 1
        # Recalculate gains for affected index
        gains = maximum_operations_gain(nums)

    return current_sum >= k

# Test example
print(canAchieveSum([1, 2, 3, 4], 15))  # Output should be decided based on actual problem-solving.
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initial Sum Calculation**: O(n), where n is the length of the nums array.
- **Operation Gain Calculation**: O(n) for each gain recalculating.
- **Total Time Complexity**: Due to the operations being bounded (maximum of 3), this results in `3 * O(n)` which simplifies to O(n).

By keeping the problem bounded to 3 operations, the overall complexity remains manageable and practical for typical input sizes observed in competitive programming and coding interviews.
