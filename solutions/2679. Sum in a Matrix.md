title:  Sum in a Matrix-out

The problem is as follows:

You are given a matrix (a list of lists) `mat` of size `m x n` where `mat[i][j]` is an integer. You need to determine the sum of the maximum values from each row after sorting each row in ascending order. 

#### Example:

Suppose `matrix = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`. 
- After sorting rows: ` [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`
- The maximum values of each row are `3, 6, 9`
- Hence, the sum would be `3 + 6 + 9 = 18`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Constraints:** 
    - What are the constraints on the size of the matrix and the values of the integers within it?
    - Is the matrix guaranteed to be non-empty?
  
2. **Output format:** 
    - Should the result be an integer sum of the maximum values?

Assuming typical constraints as follows:
- `1 <= m, n <= 1000` where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.
- `-10^4 <= mat[i][j] <= 10^4`.

### Strategy:

To solve this problem, we need to follow a straightforward approach:
1. **Sort each row** of the matrix.
2. Find the **maximum value** in each row after sorting (which will be the last element in each sorted row).
3. **Sum** these maximum values and **return** the result.

### Code:

Here is the implementation in Python:

```python
def sum_in_matrix(matrix):
    total_sum = 0
    for row in matrix:
        row.sort()
        total_sum += row[-1]  # Add the maximum element in the sorted row
    return total_sum

# Example usage
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 5, 6],
    [7, 8, 9]
]
print(sum_in_matrix(matrix))  # Output should be 18
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Sorting each row:** Sorting each row using Timsort (Python's default sorting algorithm) takes O(n log n), where n is the length of the row. Since there are m rows, the total time for sorting all rows is `O(m * n log n)`.
- **Finding and summing maximum values:** This takes `O(m)` since it is a single scan through the rows.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(m * n log n)**. Given the constraints, this is efficient and should work within acceptable limits.
