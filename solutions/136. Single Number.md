**136. Single Number**

Given a non-empty array of integers `nums`, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [2,2,1]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
Output: 4
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `-3 * 10^4 <= nums[i] <= 3 * 10^4`
- Each element in the array appears twice except for one element which appears only once.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we assume the input list is always valid and adheres to the given constraints?**
   - Yes, you can assume that the input list always adheres to the given constraints.
   
2. **Is there any constraint related to memory usage or performance we need to be mindful of?**
   - The output should be efficient in terms of time complexity. Aim for linear time complexity with constant space complexity if possible.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can leverage the properties of the XOR bitwise operation:

1. **XOR Properties:**
   - `a ^ a = 0` (XOR of a number with itself is 0)
   - `a ^ 0 = a` (XOR of a number with 0 is the number itself)
   - XOR is commutative and associative.

2. **Observations:**
   - Since XOR of two same numbers is 0, XORing all numbers in the array will cancel out all the numbers that appear twice, leaving the number that appears once.

### Code

```python
def singleNumber(nums):
    result = 0
    for num in nums:
        result ^= num
    return result
```

### Explanation

1. Initialize a variable `result` to 0.
2. Iterate through each number in the `nums` array.
3. For each number, perform XOR operation with `result` (i.e., `result ^= num`).
4. After processing all numbers, `result` will contain the single number that appears only once.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the `nums` array. We are iterating through each element exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), constant space. We are using only a single extra variable (`result`) regardless of the input size.

This approach ensures both optimal time and space performance.
