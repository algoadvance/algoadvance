You are given two integers `k` and `w`, along with two integer arrays `profits` and `capital` where `profits[i]` is the profit of the `i-th` project and `capital[i]` is the minimum capital required to start the `i-th` project.

Initially, you have `w` capital. When you start a project, you earn the profit and the profit is added to your total capital. 

You aim to select a maximum of `k` different projects to maximize your final capital and return the maximum final capital you can obtain after at most `k` selected projects.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the profits and capital arrays of the same length?
   - Yes, both arrays will be of the same length `n`.

2. Can the k be greater than the length of profits and capital arrays?
   - No, k will be less than or equal to the length of the arrays.

3. What should we return if there are no feasible projects initially?
   - If there are no feasible projects, you should return the initial capital `w`.

4. Can the profits and capital values be negative?
   - No, profits and capital values are non-negative integers.

## Strategy

1. We will use a greedy approach to always choose the most profitable project we can afford at the moment.
2. Use two heaps:
   - A min-heap to keep track of the projects based on their capital requirements.
   - A max-heap to select the most profitable project among those we can afford at the moment.
3. Initialize the min-heap with all projects based on their capital requirements.
4. Iterate up to `k` times:
   - Push all affordable projects from the min-heap to the max-heap.
   - Select the most profitable project from the max-heap.
5. Update the capital after completing each project.

## Code

```python
import heapq

def findMaximizedCapital(k, w, profits, capital):
    min_capital_heap = []
    max_profit_heap = []

    # Add all projects to the min-capital-heap
    for i in range(len(profits)):
        heapq.heappush(min_capital_heap, (capital[i], profits[i]))
    
    for _ in range(k):
        # Move affordable projects to the max-profit-heap
        while min_capital_heap and min_capital_heap[0][0] <= w:
            cap, profit = heapq.heappop(min_capital_heap)
            heapq.heappush(max_profit_heap, (-profit, cap))
        
        # If we cannot afford any more projects, break
        if not max_profit_heap:
            break
        
        # Select the most profitable project
        w += -heapq.heappop(max_profit_heap)[0]
    
    return w

# Example usage:
k = 2
w = 0
profits = [1, 2, 3]
capital = [0, 1, 1]
print(findMaximizedCapital(k, w, profits, capital))  # Output: 4
```

## Time Complexity

1. Building the initial min-heap takes O(n log n).
2. Each extraction and insertion into a heap takes O(log n), and we do this up to k times.
3. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n log n + k log n) which generally simplifies to O(n log n) if n is much larger than k.
