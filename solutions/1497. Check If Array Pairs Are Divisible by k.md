title:  Check If Array Pairs Are Divisible by k-out
permalink: /s1497
---
Given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `k`, we want to write a function `canArrange(arr, k)` that returns `true` if we can rearrange the array such that `arr[i] + arr[j]` is divisible by `k` for all `0 <= i < j < len(arr)`.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the array can contain both positive and negative integers.
2. **What should be the output if the array length is odd?**
   - If the array length is odd, it is impossible to pair all elements, so the function should return `false`.
3. **Is `k` always a positive integer?**
   - Yes, `k` is guaranteed to be a positive integer.

## Strategy:
1. **Pairing and Modulo Operation**: The core idea is to pair elements in such a way that their sum is divisible by `k`.
2. **Frequency Count of Remainders**: Compute the remainders of each element when divided by `k` and use a frequency count array to keep track of these remainders.
3. **Check Complementary Pairs**: For each remainder `r`, check if there are matching counts of elements with remainders `(k-r) % k` that can pair with `r` to form a multiple of `k`.
4. **Special Cases**:
   - Elements with a remainder of `0` have to pair amongst themselves.
   - Elements with a remainder `r` should have a counterpart with remainder `k-r`.

## Solution Code:
```python
from collections import defaultdict

def canArrange(arr, k):
    if len(arr) % 2 != 0:  # Odd length arrays can't be paired completely
        return False

    remainder_count = defaultdict(int)
    
    for num in arr:
        remainder = num % k
        if remainder < 0:
            remainder += k
        remainder_count[remainder] += 1

    for r in list(remainder_count.keys()):
        if r == 0:
            if remainder_count[r] % 2 != 0:
                return False
        else:
            if remainder_count[r] != remainder_count[k - r]:
                return False

    return True

# Example test cases
print(canArrange([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 6, 7, 8, 9], 5))  # Expected output: True
print(canArrange([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 7))  # Expected output: True
print(canArrange([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6], 10))  # Expected output: False
print(canArrange([-10, 10], 2))  # Expected output: True
print(canArrange([-1, 1, -2, 2, -3, 3, -4, 4], 3))  # Expected output: True
```

## Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input array. We traverse the array once to count remainders and then iterate over the unique remainders.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(k)`, since the remainder count dictionary's size is directly proportional to `k`.

This solution is efficient and works within linear time complexity, making it suitable for large input arrays.
