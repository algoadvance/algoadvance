title:  Longest Chunked Palindrome Decomposition-out
permalink: /s1147
---

Given a string text, return the number of chunks such that each chunk is a palindrome independently. After splitting the string into chunks, the concatenation of these chunks should result in the original string. The goal is to devise a decomposition where the number of chunks is maximized.

### Example
1. Input: text = "ghiabcdefhelloadamhelloabcdefghi"
   Output: 7

2. Input: text = "merchant"
   Output: 1

3. Input: text = "antaprezatepzapreanta"
   Output: 11

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if the input is an empty string?** 
   - An empty input string should return 0 because no chunks can be formed.

2. **Does the chunk need to include all characters in the text?**
   - Yes, every character of the string must be included in these palindromic chunks.

3. **Are there any constraints related to the length and content of the text?**
   - The problem does not specify constraints, but typically in coding challenges, the length might be constrained by typical input limits such as \(1 \leq \text{length of text} \leq 10^3\).

## Strategy

1. **Using Two-Pointer Technique:**
   - We will use two pointers, one starting from the beginning (`left`) and the other starting from the end (`right`) of the string.
   - Move `left` from the beginning to the middle and `right` from the end to the middle to find matching palindromic chunks.
   - As soon as we find a matching palindrome chunk starting from `left` and `right`, we increment the count and proceed further inward.
   - Repeat this until the pointers cross each other.

2. **Recursive Approach:**
   - At each step, if we find a palindrome chunk, we split the string and recursively apply the same logic to the remaining parts of the string.

3. **Base Cases:**
   - If the string is empty, return 0.
   - If there is no palindrome chunk found (i.e., the whole string is itself a palindrome), return 1.

## Code

```python
def longest_decomposition(text: str) -> int:
    n = len(text)
    if n == 0:
        return 0

    left, right = "", ""
    count = 0

    i, j = 0, n - 1
    while i <= j:
        left += text[i]
        right = text[j] + right
        if left == right:
            count += 1
            left, right = "", ""
        i += 1
        j -= 1

    return count

# Example test cases
print(longest_decomposition("ghiabcdefhelloadamhelloabcdefghi"))  # Output: 7
print(longest_decomposition("merchant"))  # Output: 1
print(longest_decomposition("antaprezatepzapreanta"))  # Output: 11
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(N)\)
  - The process involves a single traversal of the string from both ends with the two-pointer technique, where \(N\) is the length of the string.
  
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(N)\)
  - Due to the temporary strings `left` and `right` which potentially could grow up to the size of the input string \(N\).
