title:  Binary Watch-out
permalink: /s401
---
A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top to represent the hours (0-11), and the 6 LEDs on the bottom to represent the minutes (0-59). Each LED has a binary value (1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32), and they are read by summing the values of the LEDs that are lit.

Given a non-negative integer `num` which represents the number of LEDs that are currently on, return all possible times the watch could represent.

The order of output does not matter.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `num` be larger than 10?** 
   - No, because there are only 10 LEDs (4 for hours and 6 for minutes).
2. **Should the times be formatted in any specific way?**
   - Yes, times should be formatted in "h:mm" format, where `h` is hours (0-11) and `mm` is minutes (00-59).
3. **Can `num` be 0?**
   - Yes, and the only time then would be "0:00".

### Strategy
1. **Binary Representation**: Use the binary representation to determine the number of LEDs lit for both hours and minutes.
2. **Iteration**: Iterate over all possible combinations of hours (0-11) and minutes (0-59) to check the count of LEDs.
3. **Combination Checking**: Use a helper function to count the number of 1's in the binary representation (`bin(x).count('1')`).
4. **Result Accumulation**: Collect all valid times in a result list and return it.

### Code
```python
def readBinaryWatch(num: int):
    def bit_count(x):
        return bin(x).count('1')
    
    times = []
    for h in range(12):
        for m in range(60):
            if bit_count(h) + bit_count(m) == num:
                times.append(f"{h}:{m:02d}")
    return times

# Example usage:
# num = 1
# print(readBinaryWatch(num))
```

### Time Complexity
- **Iteration through Hours and Minutes**: We iterate through 12 hours and 60 minutes, making it a total of 720 iterations.
- **Binary Count Calculation**: Checking the binary count for each combination is `O(1)` since the max number is 12 (hours) and 59 (minutes).
- **Overall Complexity**: `O(720 * 2)` which simplifies to `O(720)` or `O(1)` since 720 is a constant.

This approach provides an efficient and concise solution to determining all possible times for a given number of LEDs lit on a binary watch.
