title:  Letter Combinations of a Phone Number-out
permalink: /s17
---

Given a string containing digits from `2-9` inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. Return the answer in **any order**.

A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below:

- 2: "abc"
- 3: "def"
- 4: "ghi"
- 5: "jkl"
- 6: "mno"
- 7: "pqrs"
- 8: "tuv"
- 9: "wxyz"

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: digits = "23"
Output: ["ad","ae","af","bd","be","bf","cd","ce","cf"]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length range of the input string?**
   - The input length can vary from 0 to 4.

2. **Is it guaranteed that the input string will only contain digits from 2 to 9?**
   - Yes, it's guaranteed that only digits from 2 to 9 are present.

3. **Do we need to account for any special characters or non-digit characters in the input?**
   - No, special characters or non-digit characters are not included.

### Strategy
We'll use a backtracking approach to solve this problem. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step strategy:

1. **Mapping Initialization**: Create a dictionary to map each digit to its corresponding letters.
2. **Recursive Function (Backtracking)**: Define a recursive function that will build combinations of letters.
3. **Base Case**: If the length of the accumulated combination matches the length of the `digits` input, append it to the result.
4. **Recursive Case**: Iterate through the possible letters for the current digit, appending each letter to the current combination and recursively building the next part of the combination.
5. **Edge Case**: If the input string is empty, immediately return an empty list.

### Code

```python
def letterCombinations(digits):
    if not digits:
        return []
    
    # Mapping from digit to corresponding letters
    phone_map = {
        "2": "abc", "3": "def", "4": "ghi", "5": "jkl", 
        "6": "mno", "7": "pqrs", "8": "tuv", "9": "wxyz"
    }
    
    result = []
    
    # Backtracking function
    def backtrack(index, path):
        # If the path length matches the digits length, we have a combination
        if index == len(digits):
            result.append("".join(path))
            return
        
        # Get letters that the current digit maps to
        possible_letters = phone_map[digits[index]]
        
        for letter in possible_letters:
            path.append(letter)  # Make a choice
            backtrack(index + 1, path)  # Explore with that choice
            path.pop()  # Undo the choice
    
    # Initiate backtracking
    backtrack(0, [])
    
    return result

# Example usage
print(letterCombinations("23"))  # Output: ['ad', 'ae', 'af', 'bd', 'be', 'bf', 'cd', 'ce', 'cf']
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(4^n)` where `n` is the length of the input `digits`. This is because each digit can map to at most 4 letters and we are generating all possible combinations. For each combination, we perform a certain fixed operation, leading to this complexity.

**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also `O(4^n)` to store the result plus the space used by the recursion stack, which means in the worst case, it will take space proportional to the number of combinations.
