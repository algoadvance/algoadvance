title:  Find Mode in Binary Search Tree-out
permalink: /s501
---

Given the `root` of a Binary Search Tree (BST), find the mode(s) (i.e., the most frequently occurred element) in the BST.

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
- `-10^5 <= Node.val <= 10^5`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can there be multiple modes?
   - **A:** Yes, there can be multiple modes if multiple values occur with the same highest frequency.

2. **Q:** Can the tree contain duplicate values?
   - **A:** Yes, since the task involves finding the most frequent elements, duplicates are relevant.

3. **Q:** What should be the output format if there are multiple modes?
   - **A:** The output should be a list containing all the mode(s).

4. **Q:** Do we need to handle any special cases such as an empty tree?
   - **A:** No, it is guaranteed that there is at least one node in the tree.

## Strategy

The strategy involves:
1. Performing an in-order traversal of the BST. This will help us retrieve values in a sorted manner (since it's a BST).
2. Utilizing a dictionary (or `collections.Counter`) to count the frequency of each value.
3. Determine the maximum frequency from the collected frequencies.
4. Collect all the values that have this maximum frequency.

## Code

```python
from typing import Optional, List
from collections import Counter

# Definition for a binary tree node
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def findMode(root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> List[int]:
    if not root:
        return []
    
    # Helper function to perform in-order traversal
    def inOrderTraversal(node, freq):
        if not node:
            return
        inOrderTraversal(node.left, freq)
        freq[node.val] += 1
        inOrderTraversal(node.right, freq)
    
    # Frequency dictionary
    freq = Counter()
    
    # Populate the frequency dictionary
    inOrderTraversal(root, freq)
    
    # Find the maximum frequency
    max_freq = max(freq.values())
    
    # Collect all the values that have the maximum frequency
    mode = [val for val, count in freq.items() if count == max_freq]
    
    return mode
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the BST.

- **In-order Traversal:** This takes \(O(n)\) time because we are visiting each node exactly once.
- **Frequency Count Update:** Each update operation in the Counter takes \(O(1)\) on average.
- **Finding Max Frequency and Collecting Modes:** Both these operations take \(O(n)\) time in the worst case because we might need to scan through all the items in the Counter.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\).

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is also \(O(n)\).

- The `Counter` will store up to \(n\) different values in the worst case.
- The space required for the recursion stack during the in-order traversal will be \(O(h)\) where \(h\) is the height of the tree. In the worst case (unbalanced tree), this could be \(O(n)\). In the best/average case (balanced tree), this would be \(O(\log n)\).

Thus, considering both the Counter and the recursion stack, the total space complexity is \(O(n)\).
