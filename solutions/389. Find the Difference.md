LeetCode 389 - **Find the Difference**

You are given two strings `s` and `t` where `t` is generated by randomly shuffling string `s` and then adding one more letter at a random position. Return the letter that was added to `t`.

### Example:
``` 
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
```

### Constraints:
- `0 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `t.length == s.length + 1`
- `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the newly added letter appear anywhere in the string `t`? 
   - Yes, it can appear at any position.
2. Should we consider the case sensitivity of the characters? 
   - No, the characters are lowercase English letters as stated in constraints.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use the following approaches:

### Approach 1: Counting with Hash Maps
We'll count the frequency of each character in both strings `s` and `t`. The character that has a higher count in `t` than in `s` is the added character.

### Approach 2: Sum of ASCII Values
Calculate the sum of ASCII values of the characters in `s` and `t`. The difference between the two sums will be the ASCII value of the added character.

### Approach 3: XOR Operation
We can use bitwise XOR to solve this problem. When two identical bits are XOR'd, the result is 0. Hence, XOR of all characters in `s` and `t` will cancel out identical characters, and the result will be the added character.

## Time Complexity
All the approaches are efficient, but the XOR approach is both time-efficient and space-efficient.
- Time Complexity: O(n), where n is the length of string `s`.
- Space Complexity: O(1), minimal extra space is used because we only need a few variables.

## Code
We'll implement the XOR approach here:

```python
def findTheDifference(s: str, t: str) -> str:
    result = 0
    for char in s:
        result ^= ord(char)
    for char in t:
        result ^= ord(char)
    return chr(result)

# Test Case
print(findTheDifference("abcd", "abcde"))  # Output: "e"
```

### Explanation of Code
1. Initialize `result` to 0.
2. XOR all characters in string `s` with `result`.
3. XOR all characters in string `t` with `result`.
4. The final value of `result` will be the ASCII value of the added character.
5. Convert this ASCII value back to the corresponding character using `chr()` function and return it.

This solution efficiently finds the extra character with linear time complexity and constant space complexity.
