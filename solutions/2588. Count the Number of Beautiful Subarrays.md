title:  Count the Number of Beautiful Subarrays-out
permalink: /s2588
---

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. An array `nums` is beautiful if:

- It has exactly `k` distinct integers.

Return the number of beautiful subarrays in the array `nums`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 4], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The beautiful subarrays are [1, 2, 1, 3], [2, 1, 3], and [1, 3, 4].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The beautiful subarrays are [1, 2], [2, 1], [1, 2], [2, 1, 2], [1, 2], and [2, 3].
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the integers in nums be negative or zero?**
   - Assuming `nums` contains only positive integers as per usual problem constraints.
   
2. **What is the maximum length of `nums`?**
   - Usually, this information helps to confirm the time complexity. Typical constraints might limit `nums` up to 10^5 elements.

3. **Should the elements in the array be distinct integers?**
   - No, `nums` can contain repeated integers.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use the **sliding window** (or two-pointer) technique combined with a hash map (or dictionary) to efficiently count distinct integers and identify subarrays that meet the criteria. Here's the strategy:

1. **Initialize pointers and data structures:**
   - Use two pointers `left` and `right` to maintain a sliding window of subarrays in `nums`.
   - Use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each integer within the current window.

2. **Expand the window:**
   - Move the `right` pointer to expand the window and include new integers until the number of distinct integers equals `k`.

3. **Shrink the window:**
   - When the number of distinct integers exceeds `k`, move the `left` pointer to shrink the window until the number of distinct integers is back to `k`.

4. **Count beautiful subarrays:**
   - Every time the number of distinct integers equals `k`, calculate the number of valid subarrays ending at the current `right` pointer.
 
### Code

Here's the implementation of the defined strategy:

```python
def count_beautiful_subarrays(nums, k):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    n = len(nums)
    count = 0
    freq_map = defaultdict(int)
    
    left = 0
    distinct_count = 0
    
    for right in range(n):
        if freq_map[nums[right]] == 0:
            distinct_count += 1
        freq_map[nums[right]] += 1
        
        while distinct_count > k:
            freq_map[nums[left]] -= 1
            if freq_map[nums[left]] == 0:
                distinct_count -= 1
            left += 1
        
        if distinct_count == k:
            temp_left = left
            while distinct_count == k:
                count += 1
                freq_map[nums[temp_left]] -= 1
                if freq_map[nums[temp_left]] == 0:
                    distinct_count -= 1
                temp_left += 1
                freq_map[nums[temp_left-1]] += 1
                if freq_map[nums[temp_left-1]] == 1:
                    distinct_count += 1
    
    return count

# Example usage
nums = [1, 2, 1, 3, 4]
k = 3
print(count_beautiful_subarrays(nums, k))  # Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

**Time Complexity:** O(n) 

- The sliding window approach ensures each element in `nums` is processed a constant number of times.
- Dictionary operations for insertion, deletion, and lookup are on average O(1) due to the hash map properties.

**Space Complexity:** O(n)

- The space is primarily used by the frequency dictionary, which can at most store `n` elements if all elements are unique.

This solution effectively counts the number of beautiful subarrays with a linear pass over `nums` ensuring optimal performance for large input sizes.
