title:  Fair Distribution of Cookies-out
permalink: /s2305
---

Given an integer array `cookies`, where `cookies[i]` denotes the number of cookies in the i-th bag and an integer `k` denoting the number of children, distribute all the bags of cookies such that the unfairness, defined as the maximum number of cookies given to any child, is minimized.

Return the minimum unfairness achievable.

## Example

- Input: `cookies = [8, 15, 10, 20, 8]`, `k = 2`
- Output: `31`
- Explanation: The optimal way is to distribute as follows:
  - Child 1: [8, 15, 8] -> Total cookies: 31
  - Child 2: [10, 20] -> Total cookies: 30

## Clarifying Questions

1. **All Bags Used?** - Do we need to distribute all cookies, or can some bags be left out?
   - Must use all the bags.
2. **Empty Bags?** - Can `cookies` be an empty list or `k` be zero?
   - No, `cookies` have at least 1 bag and `k` is at least 1.
3. **Bags More than Children?** - Can the number of bags be greater than the number of children? 
   - Yes, and each child may receive multiple bags.

## Strategy

1. **Backtracking**: Using backtracking to explore all possible ways to distribute the bags of cookies among the children.
   - We will track the sum of cookies each child has.
   - For each bag, we will attempt to give it to each child and recursively check further distributions.
   - To optimize, once a child's cookie count exceeds a current known minimum unfairness, we can backtrack.
2. **Pruning**:
   - Skip giving a bag to the same child if it has the same number of cookies as the previous distribution state (to avoid duplicate work).

## Time Complexity

The solution will have exponential complexity due to the recursive backtracking approach.
- In the worst case, it would check all \(O(k^n)\) distributions, where \(n\) is the number of bags and \(k\) is the number of children.

Let's implement the solution:

```python
def distributeCookies(cookies, k):
    def backtrack(i, children):
        if i == len(cookies):
            return max(children)
        
        min_unfairness = float('inf')
        for j in range(k):
            children[j] += cookies[i]
            min_unfairness = min(min_unfairness, backtrack(i + 1, children))
            children[j] -= cookies[i]
            # prune if a child hasn't any cookies yet and we are going to give cookies to them
            if children[j] == 0:
                break
        
        return min_unfairness
    
    return backtrack(0, [0] * k)

# Example usage
cookies = [8, 15, 10, 20, 8]
k = 2
print(distributeCookies(cookies, k))  # Output: 31
```

In this function:
1. `backtrack(i, children)` recursively distributes the bags of cookies starting from index `i` among `children` list.
2. `min_unfairness` captures the minimum achievable unfairness across all distributions.
3. The `if` condition `children[j] == 0` helps in pruning redundant work when a child who hasn't received any cookies yet is considered for the current bag. Ensuring each child gets an optimal distribution.
