title:  Minimum Number of Operations to Make Arrays Similar-out
permalink: /s2449
---
You are given two arrays, `nums` and `target`, of the same length. In one operation, you can select any two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `0 <= i, j < nums.length` and swap `nums[i]` with `nums[j]`. The goal is to make `nums` similar to `target` using the minimum number of operations. Two arrays `A` and `B` are considered similar if we can rearrange the elements of `A` to match `B`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the elements in `nums` and `target` always unique?**
   - No, the elements can be repeated.
2. **Is the order of elements in `target` significant?**
   - No, the order is not significant; `nums` just needs to be a permutation of `target`.
3. **Can the lengths of `nums` and `target` be zero?**
   - Given they are of the same length, both arrays will either be of length zero or greater.

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, let's leverage sorting:

1. **Sort Both Arrays**:
   - By sorting both `nums` and `target`, we can align elements directly in a one-to-one comparison.
   
2. **Count Differences**:
   - Calculate the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of the sorted `nums` and `target`.

3. **Sum Differences**:
   - Sum all the differences and then divide by 2 to get the number of operations since each swap can address two out-of-place elements.

### Code
```python
def minOperations(nums, target):
    # Sort both arrays
    nums.sort()
    target.sort()

    # Calculate the total number of moves needed.
    moves = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        moves += abs(nums[i] - target[i])
    
    # Each operation can handle two swaps since we always correct two positions with one operation.
    return moves // 2
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: Sorting both arrays will take `O(n log n)`.
- **Traversing**: Traversing the sorted arrays to calculate differences takes `O(n)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step.
