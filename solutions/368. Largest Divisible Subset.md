title:  Largest Divisible Subset-out
permalink: /s368
---

Given a set of **distinct** positive integers, find the largest subset such that every pair (Si, Sj) of elements in this subset satisfies:

`Si % Sj == 0` or `Sj % Si == 0`.

If there are multiple solutions, return any subset is fine.

### Example 1:

Input: `[1,2,3]`  
Output: `[1,2]` (or `[1,3]`)

### Example 2:

Input: `[1,2,4,8]`  
Output: `[1,2,4,8]`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Can the input array be empty?**  
   A: No, the input array will have at least one element.
   
2. **Q: Can input arrays have very large numbers?**  
   A: Yes, but you can assume that computations will not cause integer overflow.

3. **Q: Are duplicate numbers allowed in the input array?**  
   A: No, the input array consists of distinct positive integers.

## Strategy

1. **Sort the Array:** Start by sorting the array. This helps in ensuring that for any pair `Si` and `Sj` with `i < j`, `Si` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to `Sj`.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:** 
   - Maintain a list `dp` where `dp[i]` stores the largest divisible subset that ends with the element `nums[i]`.
   - For each `nums[i]`, check all previous elements `nums[j]` (where `j < i`). If `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`, then `nums[i]` can extend the subset ending with `nums[j]`.
   
3. **Backtracking to Find Solution Path:** 
   - Use another list `previous_index` to help trace back the largest divisible subset.
   - `previous_index[i]` stores the index of the previous element in the divisible subset for `nums[i]`.

4. **Extract the Longest Subset:** 
   - Once the `dp` and `previous_index` lists are prepared, determine the subset by backtracking from the maximum subset length found.

## Code Implementation

```python
def largestDivisibleSubset(nums):
    if not nums:
        return []
    
    nums.sort()
    n = len(nums)
    
    dp = [[num] for num in nums]
    max_subset = []
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0 and len(dp[j]) + 1 > len(dp[i]):
                dp[i] = dp[j] + [nums[i]]
        if len(dp[i]) > len(max_subset):
            max_subset = dp[i]
    
    return max_subset
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** O(n log n)
- **Dynamic Programming:** O(n^2), since for each element, we are iterating through all previous elements to update the `dp` list.

**Overall Time Complexity:** O(n^2)

This should be manageable for standard input limits in coding interviews.
