title:  Longest Uploaded Prefix-out
permalink: /s2424
---

Suppose a file sharing system where:
1. You are given a list of integers, each representing an ID of a file uploaded to the system.
2. The IDs are sequential in nature starting from 1 (1, 2, 3, ...).

You need to implement a class `LUPrefix` that:
1. Initializes with a stream of files.
2. Provides a function to register a file upload.
3. Evaluates and returns the length of the longest consecutive prefix of file uploads.

The class will have the following methods:
- `__init__(self, n: int)`: Initializes the system with `n` files.
- `upload(self, video: int) -> None`: Registers the upload of the file with ID `video`.
- `longest(self) -> int`: Returns the length of the longest consecutive prefix of uploaded files starting from 1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What happens if the same file ID is uploaded more than once?** 
   - Typically, file IDs should be unique for this context, and redundant uploads of the same file ID can be ignored.
  
2. **Can the uploads come in out of order?**
   - Yes, uploads can occur out of order.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize an array (or a set) to keep track of all uploaded files.
   - Maintain a variable `longest_prefix` to keep track of the length of the longest consecutive prefix.

2. **Upload Registration:**
   - When a file with a given ID is uploaded, mark it as uploaded in your data structure.
   - Update the `longest_prefix` if the newly uploaded ID extends the current longest prefix.

3. **Evaluating Longest Prefix:**
   - This method returns the `longest_prefix` which can be updated dynamically as IDs are uploaded.

### Code

```python
class LUPrefix:
    def __init__(self, n: int):
        self.uploaded = set()
        self.longest_prefix = 0

    def upload(self, video: int) -> None:
        self.uploaded.add(video)
        while self.longest_prefix + 1 in self.uploaded:
            self.longest_prefix += 1

    def longest(self) -> int:
        return self.longest_prefix
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization (`__init__`)**
  - Time Complexity: O(1) because it initializes the set and other variables.

- **Upload (`upload`)**
  - Worst-case Time Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of consecutive uploads, but on average, it should be much less because it only extends the prefix when necessary.
  
- **Longest (`longest`)**
  - Time Complexity: O(1) as it directly returns the `longest_prefix`.

This implementation efficiently manages the uploads and determines the longest prefix dynamically.
