title:  Minimum Operations to Make the Integer Zero-out
permalink: /s2749
---
Given two integers `num1` and `num2`, your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to make `num1` equal to 0. In one operation, you can choose either to subtract `num2` from `num1` or divide `num1` by 2 (if `num1` is even). The goal is to find and return the minimum number of operations needed to reduce `num1` to 0.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What should we do if `num1` is already zero?
   - **A:** If `num1` is already zero, no operations are needed.
   
2. **Q:** Can `num2` be zero?
   - **A:** The problem does not specify this, but typically `num2` should be non-zero to make the problem meaningful. If `num2` is zero, we can never make progress by subtraction, so let's assume `num2` is always non-zero.
   
3. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the size of `num1` or `num2`?
   - **A:** The problem does not specify, but we can assume they are within a typical integer range that Python can handle.

### Strategy
We need a strategy to minimize the operations:
1. If `num1` is even, dividing by 2 is usually beneficial.
2. If `num1` is odd, we need to decide whether to subtract `num2` to make it even or take other steps.

We can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to explore all possible sequences of operations. Each state can be represented as a tuple `(current_num, steps)` where `current_num` is the value of `num1` at that step, and `steps` is the number of operations taken to reach that state.

### Code
```python
from collections import deque

def minimumOperations(num1: int, num2: int) -> int:
    if num1 == 0:
        return 0
    
    # Using a queue to perform BFS
    queue = deque([(num1, 0)])
    visited = set()
    
    while queue:
        current, steps = queue.popleft()
        
        if current == 0:
            return steps
        
        # If already visited, skip
        if current in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(current)
        
        # Option 1: Subtract num2
        if current >= num2:
            queue.append((current - num2, steps + 1))
        
        # Option 2: Divide by 2 (only if current is even)
        if current % 2 == 0:
            queue.append((current // 2, steps + 1))
    
    # If the loop completes without finding 0, return -1 as a fallback
    return -1

# Example Usage
# num1 = 10, num2 = 4:
# Output: 2 (10 -> 8 -> 0)
print(minimumOperations(10, 4))
```

### Time Complexity
The worst-case time complexity for this approach is `O(num1)`, because each unique integer value of `num1` might be visited at most once. The operations we perform are constant time, making this approach efficient given the constraints.

The space complexity is also `O(num1)` due to the storage of visited states and the BFS queue.

This BFS ensures we explore the shortest path to zero first, guaranteeing an optimal solution.
