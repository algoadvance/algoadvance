title:  Intervals Between Identical Elements-out
permalink: /s2121
---

You are given a **0-indexed** array of integers `arr`. For each element in `arr`, find the sum of the minimum distances between that element and every other identical element in `arr`. Return an array `answer` of the same length where `answer[i]` is the sum of distances for the element `arr[i]`.

### Example

```
Input: arr = [1,3,1,1,2]
Output: [5,0,3,4,0]
Explanation: Distances between identical elements are:
- arr[0] and arr[2] -> distance = 2, arr[0] and arr[3] -> distance = 3 (total = 5)
- arr[1] is unique (total = 0)
- arr[2] and arr[0] -> distance = 2, arr[2] and arr[3] -> distance = 1 (total = 3)
- arr[3] and arr[0] -> distance = 3, arr[3] and arr[2] -> distance = 1 (total = 4)
- arr[4] is unique (total = 0)
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for the elements in the array?**
   This problem deals with integers. Assume the range of integers is sufficiently large.
   
2. **Can the array be empty or contain negative numbers?**
   The array can contain negative numbers but cannot be empty as it would not make sense to compute distances on an empty array.

3. **Do we need to consider the order of distances?**
   No, we sum the distances regardless of the order.

### Strategy

1. **Position Tracking:** Use a dictionary to track the indices of each unique element in the array.
2. **Calculate Distances:** For each element, iterate through its positions, calculate the distances to other positions, and sum them up.
3. **Efficient Calculation:** Using cumulative sums to efficiently calculate distances.

### Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def getDistances(arr):
    # Dictionary to store the positions of each element
    positions = defaultdict(list)
    
    # Populate the dictionary with positions
    for idx, value in enumerate(arr):
        positions[value].append(idx)
    
    n = len(arr)
    answer = [0] * n
    
    # Calculate distances for each value
    for value, pos_list in positions.items():
        k = len(pos_list)
        if k == 1:
            # If there's only one occurrence, distance is zero
            continue
        
        # Compute prefix sums
        prefix_sum = [0] * k
        prefix_sum[0] = pos_list[0]
        for i in range(1, k):
            prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i-1] + pos_list[i]
        
        for i in range(k):
            left_sum = prefix_sum[i-1] if i > 0 else 0
            right_sum = prefix_sum[-1] - prefix_sum[i]
            answer[pos_list[i]] = (pos_list[i] * i - left_sum) + (right_sum - pos_list[i] * (k - i - 1))
    
    return answer
```

### Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing:** \(O(N)\) where \(N\) is the length of the array. This is for populating the `positions` dictionary.
- **Distance Calculation:** For each unique element, calculating prefix sums and distances is a linear operation relative to the number of positions \(k\). In the worst case, the combined total is still \(O(N)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(N)\). The space complexity is also \(O(N)\) due to storing the indices and the result array.
