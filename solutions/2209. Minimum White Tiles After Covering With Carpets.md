title:  Minimum White Tiles After Covering With Carpets-out
permalink: /s2209
---

You are given a binary string `floor`, which represents the floor length. The string consists of '0's and '1's, where '0's represent black tiles and '1's represent white tiles. You are also given the number `numCarpets`, which represents the number of carpets available to cover the floor, and `carpetLen`, which represents the length of each carpet. 

Each carpet can only cover consecutive tiles (either black or white). Your task is to determine the minimum number of white tiles that will remain uncovered after using the carpets.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length of the string `floor`?**
   - The length of the string `floor` can range from 1 to \(10^5\).

2. **Can a carpet be placed partially over the floor?**
   - No, a carpet covers a full segment of the floor of length `carpetLen`.

3. **Can the carpets overlap?**
   - Yes, carpets can overlap.

4. **Is each carpet identical in length?**
   - Yes, each carpet is of length `carpetLen`.

### Strategy

1. **Sliding Window for Counting Whites:**
   - Use a sliding window technique to calculate the number of white tiles (`'1'`) that can be covered by each possible placement of a new carpet.

2. **Dynamic Programming for Optimal Covering:**
   - Define a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of uncovered white tiles from `floor[0]` to `floor[i]` given the available carpets.

3. **Iterative Calculation:**
   - Traverse the `floor` while updating the `dp` array based on the placement of carpets and adjusting for overlap.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Handle cases where the `floor` length is shorter than the carpet length and where no carpets can be placed.

### Code

Here is a well-commented Python solution using dynamic programming and sliding window:

```python
def minimumWhiteTiles(floor: str, numCarpets: int, carpetLen: int) -> int:
    n = len(floor)
    # dp[i] will be the minimum white tiles we can have in floor[0:i]
    dp = [float('inf')] * (n + 1) 
    dp[0] = 0  # No tiles to cover if there's no floor

    # Precompute the number of white tiles in the first i tiles
    prefix_white = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        prefix_white[i] = prefix_white[i - 1]
        if floor[i - 1] == '1':
            prefix_white[i] += 1

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        # Without using any carpet, the number of white tiles is just the sum from 0 to i-1
        dp[i] = prefix_white[i]
        
        if numCarpets > 0:
            # Try using carpets
            # If there's at least one carpet available, try placing it optimally
            for j in range(1, numCarpets + 1):
                if i - j * carpetLen >= 0:
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - j * carpetLen] + prefix_white[i] - prefix_white[i - j * carpetLen])
                else:
                    dp[i] = min(dp[i], prefix_white[i - j * carpetLen] - prefix_white[0])

    return dp[n]

# Example usage
floor = "10110101"
numCarpets = 2
carpetLen = 2
print(minimumWhiteTiles(floor, numCarpets, carpetLen))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n \times m)\), where:
- \(n\) is the length of the `floor` string.
- \(m\) is the number of carpets, `numCarpets`.

This complexity arises due to the nested loops iterating over positions and carpets. Given constraints, this solution will run efficiently for input sizes typical of the problem's constraints.
