title:  Partition Array Into Three Parts With Equal Sum-out
permalink: /s1013
---

Given an array `arr` of integers, return `true` if we can partition the array into three non-empty parts with equal sums.

Formally, you need to find indices `i` and `j` with `i+1 < j` such that `(arr[0] + arr[1] + ... + arr[i]) == (arr[i+1] + arr[i+2] + ... + arr[j-1]) == (arr[j] + arr[j+1] + ... + arr[arr.length - 1])`

### Example:

1. Input: `arr = [0,2,1,-6,6,-7,9,1,2,0,1]`
   Output: `true` (Explanation: The array is partitioned as [0,2,1], [-6,6,-7,9,1], [2,0,1])
2. Input: `arr = [0,2,1,-6,6,7,9,-1,2,0,1]`
   Output: `false`
3. Input: `arr = [3,3,6,5,-2,2,5,1,-9,4]`
   Output: `true` (Explanation: The array can be partitioned as [3,3], [6,5,-2,2], [5,1,-9,4])

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array be empty or have fewer than 3 elements?** No, the problem states that the array must be partitioned into three non-empty parts.
2. **Are there any constraints on the values within the array, such as the range of integers?** No specific constraints regarding the range of integer values, but typical integer handling should suffice.

## Strategy

1. **Calculate the Total Sum:** Determine the total sum of the array.
2. **Check Divisibility:** If the total sum is not divisible by 3, return false immediately as it cannot be partitioned into three equal parts.
3. **Partitioning:** Traverse through the array while maintaining a running sum. Whenever the running sum equals one-third of the total sum, we increment a counter and reset the running sum. If we find exactly two such partitions (which means we also have a third part automatically), we can partition the array into three parts.
4. **Return Result:** If the counter reaches at least two by the end, return true. Otherwise, return false.

## Code

```python
def canThreePartsEqualSum(arr):
    total_sum = sum(arr)
    if total_sum % 3 != 0:
        return False
    
    target_sum = total_sum // 3
    running_sum, count, n = 0, 0, len(arr)
    
    for num in arr:
        running_sum += num
        if running_sum == target_sum:
            count += 1
            running_sum = 0
        if count == 2 and running_sum == 0:
            return True
    
    return False

# Test Cases
print(canThreePartsEqualSum([0,2,1,-6,6,-7,9,1,2,0,1])) # Expected: True
print(canThreePartsEqualSum([0,2,1,-6,6,7,9,-1,2,0,1])) # Expected: False
print(canThreePartsEqualSum([3,3,6,5,-2,2,5,1,-9,4]))   # Expected: True
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the array. We traverse the array at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` since we use a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
