You are given an `m x n` integer array `grid` where `grid[i][j]` could be:

- 1: The starting square. There is exactly one starting square.
- 2: The ending square. There is exactly one ending square.
- 0: Empty squares we can walk over.
- -1: Obstacles that we cannot walk over.

Return the number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the ending square, that walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the start and end positions be the same?**
   No, the start and end positions are distinct as per the problem statement.

2. **Is the grid guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   Yes, the grid is guaranteed to be non-empty and contains at least one row and one column.

3. **Can we walk outside the grid boundary?**
   No, we can't walk outside the grid boundary. Movement is restricted within the grid.

### Strategy

1. **Find the Start and End Points**: First, we need to identify the coordinates of the start point (where the value is 1), the end point (where the value is 2), and count the total number of non-obstacle cells (value 0 or 2).

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Use DFS to navigate the grid from the start point, keeping track of the number of cells visited. 

3. **Backtracking**: During the DFS traversal, we will mark the current cell as visited and move to the next cell. If we reach the end cell and have visited all non-obstacle cells exactly once, increment the count of valid paths.

4. **Undo Marking (Backtrack)**: After exploring all possible moves from the current cell, unmark it and backtrack to explore alternative paths.

### Code

Here's the Python implementation of the solution:

```python
def uniquePathsIII(grid):
    def dfs(x, y, remaining):
        nonlocal path_count
        if not (0 <= x < m and 0 <= y < n and grid[x][y] >= 0):
            return
        
        if grid[x][y] == 2:
            if remaining == 1:
                path_count += 1
            return
        
        temp = grid[x][y]
        grid[x][y] = -2  # mark as visited
        remaining -= 1
        
        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            dfs(x + dx, y + dy, remaining)
        
        # Backtrack
        grid[x][y] = temp

    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    remaining_non_obstacle = 0
    
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if grid[i][j] == 1:
                start_x, start_y = i, j
            if grid[i][j] == 2 or grid[i][j] == 0:
                remaining_non_obstacle += 1
    
    path_count = 0
    dfs(start_x, start_y, remaining_non_obstacle + 1)
    
    return path_count
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach mainly depends on the number of cells and the number of possible states to explore. Given `m` as the number of rows and `n` as the number of columns in the grid:

- **DFS Traversal**: In the worst case, the DFS will explore every cell once while considering all 4 directional moves. Hence, the DFS has a time complexity of \(O(4^{mn})\) in the worst case where every cell is an open path.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(mn)\) for the recursion stack in the case of nearly all cells being visited maximally.

This completes our solution for the problem of finding all unique paths in a grid, visiting each non-obstacle cell exactly once.
