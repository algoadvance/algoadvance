title:  Find the Power of K-Size Subarrays I-out
permalink: /s3254
---

You are given an integer array `nums`, and two integers `k` and `p`. You need to find the number of distinct k-size subarrays of `nums` such that the number of elements divisible by `p` in that subarray is an `in` integer.

For instance, given the array `nums = [2, 3, 3, 2, 3]`, `k = 2`, and `p = 2`, the possible 2-size subarrays are `[2, 3]`, `[3, 3]`, `[3, 2]`, `[2, 3]`. If the number of elements divisible by `p` (which is 2) is even in the subarray, we include it in our count. The distinct subarrays, in this case, would be `[2, 3]` and `[3, 2]` (both have an even count: 1 element divisible by 2).

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the array `nums` contain negative numbers?
2. Is `k` guaranteed to be less than or equal to the length of `nums`?
3. Are there any constraints on the size of the array `nums` or the values of `k` and `p`?
4. What should be returned if no subarrays meet the condition?

## Strategy

1. First, generate all the k-size subarrays of the given array `nums`.
2. For each subarray, check the number of elements divisible by `p` and whether this count is an even number.
3. Use a set to keep track of subarrays that meet the condition (an even count of elements divisible by `p`) to ensure uniqueness.
4. The final result will be the size of this set, representing the number of distinct subarrays that meet the prescribed condition.

## Code

```python
def count_distinct_k_size_subarrays(nums, k, p):
    # Helper function to check if a subarray meets the condition
    def is_valid(subarray, p):
        count = sum(1 for num in subarray if num % p == 0)
        return count % 2 == 0
    
    # Set to store distinct valid subarrays
    distinct_subarrays = set()
    
    n = len(nums)
    
    # Iterate to get all k-size subarrays
    for i in range(n - k + 1):
        subarray = tuple(nums[i:i+k])  # Using tuple to make subarray hashable for the set
        if is_valid(subarray, p):
            distinct_subarrays.add(subarray)
    
    return len(distinct_subarrays)

# Example usage:
nums = [2, 3, 3, 2, 3]
k = 2
p = 2

print(count_distinct_k_size_subarrays(nums, k, p))  # Output should be the number of distinct valid subarrays
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Subarray Generation**: Generating each k-size subarray takes \(O(k)\), and since we do this for each starting index \(i\) in the array of length \(n\), this takes \(O(nk)\).
2. **Checking Validity**: Checking the number of elements divisible by \(p\) for each subarray also takes \(O(k)\).
3. **Storing in Set**: In the worst case, adding to a set and checking for duplicates can take \(O(k)\) if the subarray has to be compared.

Thus, overall time complexity is \(O(nk^2)\).

**Conclusion**: The code ensures that we efficiently find and count distinct k-size subarrays with the given condition, and the complexity should be manageable for reasonably sized inputs.
