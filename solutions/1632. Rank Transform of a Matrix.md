title:  Rank Transform of a Matrix-out
permalink: /s1632
---

You are given an `m x n` matrix `matrix`. You need to transform this matrix such that the rank of each element is replaced with its rank.

The rank is defined as follows:

- The rank of a number is the smallest possible integer such that if you sort all elements of the matrix and replace each value with its rank, the ordering of values in the matrix does not change.
- Two elements are equal if and only if their ranks are equal.
- For any two integers `a` and `b`, if `a < b`, then the rank(a) < rank(b).

Return the new matrix as the rank-transformed matrix.

Formally, the rank of the `i-th` smallest element is `(i + 1)`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Matrix Size Constraints:** Can we assume that the dimensions of the matrix (m x n) will be within a reasonable size (1 <= m, n <= 500)?
2. **Element Constraints:** Can we assume that the matrix elements (matrix[i][j]) will fit within common integer ranges?

### Strategy

The strategy involves the following steps:

1. **Initialization:** Create a list of matrix elements along with their positions.

2. **Sorting:** Sort the elements based on their values. This will help determine ranks.

3. **Union-Find to Manage Ranks:**
   - Use a union-find (disjoint set) data structure to handle connections between elements in their rows and columns.
   - Ensure that equal elements within the same row or column get the same rank.

4. **Rank Assignment:**
   - Use a nested dictionary to keep track of the maximum rank currently possible for any element's row and column.
   - Traverse through the sorted list to assign ranks, update the row and column maximum ranks as we progress.

5. **Result Construction:** Build the final transformed matrix using the assigned ranks.

### Code Solution

```python
def matrixRankTransform(matrix):
    import itertools
    
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    rank = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    
    # Create a list of cells with their positions and values
    cells = [(i, j, matrix[i][j]) for i in range(m) for j in range(n)]
    
    # Sort cells based on value
    cells.sort(key=lambda x: x[2])
    
    # Row and column maximum rank lookup
    row_max_rank = [-1] * m
    col_max_rank = [-1] * n
    
    # Union-Find structure to manage connectivity within rows and columns
    parent = {}
    
    def find(x):
        parent.setdefault(x, x)
        if parent[x] != x:
            parent[x] = find(parent[x])
        return parent[x]
    
    def union(x, y):
        parent[find(x)] = find(y)
    
    i = 0
    while i < len(cells):
        j = i
        # Get the value that we are currently assigning ranks for
        while j < len(cells) and cells[j][2] == cells[i][2]:
            j += 1
        
        # Same value group
        groups = {}
        
        for k in range(i, j):
            r, c, v = cells[k]
            row_root = find(('r', r))
            col_root = find(('c', c))
            
            # Union rows and columns in the same value group
            union(row_root, col_root)
            
            group_id = find(('r', r))
            if group_id not in groups:
                groups[group_id] = []
            groups[group_id].append((r, c, v))
        
        # Assign ranks within groups
        for group_id, group_cells in groups.items():
            max_rank = 0
            for r, c, v in group_cells:
                max_rank = max(max_rank, row_max_rank[r], col_max_rank[c])
            
            rank_to_assign = max_rank + 1
            
            for r, c, v in group_cells:
                rank[r][c] = rank_to_assign
                row_max_rank[r] = rank_to_assign
                col_max_rank[c] = rank_to_assign
        
        i = j
    
    return rank

# Example Usage
matrix = [
    [1, 2],
    [3, 4]
]
print(matrixRankTransform(matrix))
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** This has a time complexity of \(O(m \times n \log(m \times n))\).
- **Union-Find Operations:** These are nearly constant time operations (amortized) and the complexity mainly depends on the sorting step.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(m \times n \log(m \times n))\).
