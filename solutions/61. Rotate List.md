title:  Rotate List-out

Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by `k` places.

### Example
Given the list: `1->2->3->4->5`, and `k = 2`, the list becomes `4->5->1->2->3`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be returned if `k` is zero?**
   - The list should remain unchanged.
2. **What should be returned if the list is empty or contains only a single node?**
   - The list should remain unchanged in these cases.
3. **What if `k` is greater than the length of the list?**
   - If `k` is greater than the length of the list, then `k` should effectively be `k % n` where `n` is the length of the list.
4. **Is the definition of `rotate` meaning that we move the last `k` elements to the front?**
   - Yes, the last `k` elements should be moved to the front.

### Strategy
To rotate the list:
1. **Calculate List Length:**
   - Traverse through the list to determine its length.
2. **Normalize `k`:**
   - Adjust `k` such that `0 <= k < length` (i.e., `k = k % length`).
3. **Finding the New Head:**
   - If `k` = 0 after normalization, no rotation is needed.
   - Otherwise, find the new head of the rotated list. This involves identifying the node that will become the last node after rotation.
4. **Rearrange Pointers:**
   - Reconnect the nodes such that the list is rotated appropriately.

### Code
```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

def rotateRight(head: ListNode, k: int) -> ListNode:
    if not head or not head.next or k == 0:
        return head

    # Determine the length of the list
    length = 1
    current = head
    while current.next:
        current = current.next
        length += 1

    # Connect the tail to the head to make it circular
    current.next = head

    # Compute the effective rotations needed
    k = k % length
    steps_to_new_head = length - k

    # Find the new head and the new tail
    new_tail = head
    for _ in range(steps_to_new_head - 1):
        new_tail = new_tail.next
    
    new_head = new_tail.next
    new_tail.next = None

    return new_head
```

### Time Complexity
- **O(n) where n is the length of the list:**
  - Traversing the list to calculate its length takes O(n).
  - Finding the new head takes another O(n) in the worst case.
  
Thus, the time complexity is O(n).

### Explanation
1. **Length Calculation:**
   - First, traverse the list to count the number of nodes.
2. **Forming a Circular List:**
   - Connect the last node to the head to form a circular linked list.
3. **Effective Rotations:**
   - Compute `k % length` to handle cases where `k` is larger than the list length.
4. **New Head and Tail:**
   - Iterate to find the new tail towards the end of the list, which will break the circular link to form the newly rotated list.
