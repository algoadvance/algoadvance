title:  Sorting the Sentence-out
permalink: /s1859

The problem requires writing a function `sortSentence` that takes a single string `s` as input. The string represents a jumbled sentence where each word is appended with a digit indicating its position in the original sentence. Your task is to reconstruct and return the sentence in its original order, removing the digits.

**Example:**
```
Input: s = "is2 sentence4 This1 a3"
Output: "This is a sentence"
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can there be multiple spaces between words?  
   **A:** No, you can assume there is a single space between words.

2. **Q:** Will the input sentence always be valid and contain all words correctly suffixed by digits?  
   **A:** Yes, you can assume the input is always valid.

3. **Q:** What is the range of the input length?  
   **A:** The input length `s` is within the range of 1 to 200.

### Code

```python
def sortSentence(s: str) -> str:
    # Split the input string into words
    words = s.split()
    
    # Create a list for sorted words placed in their correct positions
    sorted_words = [""] * len(words)
    
    # Iterate through each word to strip the number and place it in its position
    for word in words:
        index = int(word[-1]) - 1  # Get the position and convert to zero-indexed
        sorted_words[index] = word[:-1]  # Remove the digit and place the word
    
    # Join the sorted words to form the final sentence
    return " ".join(sorted_words)

# Example usage
s = "is2 sentence4 This1 a3"
print(sortSentence(s))  # Output: "This is a sentence"
```

### Strategy

1. **Splitting the Sentence:**  
   Split the input string `s` by spaces to get individual word fragments. Each fragment will contain a word followed by a digit.

2. **Creating Sorted List:**
   Initialize a list `sorted_words` to store the sorted words according to their positions indicated by the digits.

3. **Placing Words Correctly:**
   Iterate through each fragment, extract the digit and convert it to a zero-index position. Remove the digit from the word and place it in the `sorted_words` list at the correct index.

4. **Forming the Final Sentence:**
   Join all elements of the `sorted_words` list into a single string with spaces to form the correctly ordered sentence.

### Time Complexity

- **Splitting the input string:**  
  This operation takes O(n) where n is the length of the string, since Python's split function is linear.

- **Iterating and placing words:**  
  The iteration through the list and placing words in the correct index also takes O(n), since each word is processed once.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, where n is the number of characters in the input string `s`.
