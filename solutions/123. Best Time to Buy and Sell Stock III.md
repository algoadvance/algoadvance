title:  Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock III-out
permalink: /s123
---

You are given an integer array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most two transactions.

**Note**: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

### Example:

**Input**: prices = [3,3,5,0,0,3,1,4]

**Output**: 6

**Explanation**: Buy on day 4 (price = 0) and sell on day 6 (price = 3), profit = 3-0 = 3. Then buy on day 7 (price = 1) and sell on day 8 (price = 4), profit = 4-1 = 3.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input array be empty or have just one element?**
   - If the input array is empty or has only one element, then the output should be 0 since no transactions can be performed.

2. **Is it guaranteed that the array contains only positive integers?**
   - Yes, typically in this problem the stock prices are positive integers.

3. **What should be returned if no profit can be made?**
   - If no profit can be made, the function should return 0.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
    - Define four states for dynamic programming:
        1. First buy
        2. First sell
        3. Second buy
        4. Second sell
    - Iterate through the list of prices updating the four states accordingly:
        - Track the minimum prices for buys and maximum profit for sells.

### Code

Here is the python code implementing the above strategy:

```python
def maxProfit(prices):
    if not prices:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize the variables for the four states.
    first_buy = float('inf')
    first_sell = 0
    second_buy = float('inf')
    second_sell = 0
    
    for price in prices:
        # Update the states according to the given price.
        first_buy = min(first_buy, price)
        first_sell = max(first_sell, price - first_buy)
        second_buy = min(second_buy, price - first_sell)
        second_sell = max(second_sell, price - second_buy)
    
    return second_sell
```

### Strategy Explanation

1. **Initialize Variables:**
    - `first_buy` is initialized to a very large number to ensure the first assignment happens correctly.
    - `first_sell` is initially 0 because no profit is made yet.
    - `second_buy` is similar to the first buy with an adjustment for the profit made from the first sell.
    - `second_sell` starts from 0 as no second selling profit is made initially.

2. **Iterate Through Prices:**
    - At each price point update the four states:
        - `first_buy` (minimum price to do the first buy).
        - `first_sell` (maximum profit from the first buy).
        - `second_buy` (minimum effective cost price for second buy considering the first sell profit).
        - `second_sell` (maximum profit from the second sell).

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the prices list. We iterate through the list once updating the states.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space irrespective of the input size.

This solution efficiently computes the maximum profit with at most two transactions, making it optimal in both time and space.
