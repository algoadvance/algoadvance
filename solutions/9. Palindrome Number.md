Determine whether an integer is a palindrome. An integer is a palindrome when it reads the same backward as forward.

**Examples:**
- `121` is a palindrome.
- `-121` is not a palindrome because reading it backward reads as `121-`.
- `10` is not a palindrome because reading it backward reads as `01`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Q:** Can the integer be negative?
   - **A:** Yes, it can be negative, but negative numbers are typically not palindromes.
2. **Q:** Can the integer end with zeros?
   - **A:** Yes, it can, but such numbers are not palindromic.
3. **Q:** Do we need to handle large integers?
   - **A:** The problem should handle the maximum constraints of common integer values in programming.

### Strategy:
1. **Negative Numbers:** Immediately return `False` if the number is negative.
2. **Convert to String:** Convert the integer to a string and compare it to its reverse.
3. **Return Result:** Return whether the string representation is equal to its reverse.

Here's how the implementation looks:

### Code:
```python
def isPalindrome(x: int) -> bool:
    # Negative numbers are not palindromes
    if x < 0:
        return False
    
    # Convert number to string
    str_x = str(x)
    
    # Compare string with its reverse
    return str_x == str_x[::-1]

# Test cases
print(isPalindrome(121))  # Output: True
print(isPalindrome(-121)) # Output: False
print(isPalindrome(10))   # Output: False
print(isPalindrome(0))    # Output: True
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Conversion and Reversal:** Converting the integer to a string and reversing it both involve linear time operations.
- **Comparison:** Comparing two strings of length `n` takes `O(n)` time.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of digits in the integer.
