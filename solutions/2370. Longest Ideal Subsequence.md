title:  Longest Ideal Subsequence-out
permalink: /s2370
---

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase letters and an integer `k`. We call a string `t` ideal if the absolute difference between the ASCII values of every two adjacent characters in `t` is less than or equal to `k`.

Return the length of the longest ideal string.

Example:
```
Input: s = "acfgbd", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest ideal string is "acbd". The length of the longest ideal string is 4.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for the integer `k`?**
   - Typically `k` would be within a small range (like 1 to 26, considering there are 26 letters in the alphabet).

2. **What is the length of the input string `s`?**
   - The length of `s` can be up to \(10^5\) as per typical competitive programming constraints.

3. **Can `s` be empty?**
   - For most such problems, it can be useful to handle empty strings, though typically constraints would specify lengths of at least 1.

4. **Is the input string `s` only lowercase English letters?**
   - Yes, it consists only of lowercase English letters.

## Strategy

1. Use dynamic programming to solve this problem efficiently.
2. Maintain a list `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest ideal subsequence ending with the character `chr(i + 97)` (to adjust for ASCII values).
3. Iterate through each character in the input string `s` and for each character, check the range of valid previous characters which could be included in the ideal subsequence.
4. Update `dp` for each character based on the maximum value from the valid range of previous characters plus one.

## Code

Here's the Python solution:

```python
def longestIdealString(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    dp = [0] * 26  # Initialize DP array for 26 lowercase letters

    for char in s:
        char_idx = ord(char) - ord('a')
        max_len = 0

        # Check within k range centered at char_idx
        for i in range(max(0, char_idx - k), min(25, char_idx + k) + 1):
            max_len = max(max_len, dp[i])

        dp[char_idx] = max_len + 1

    return max(dp)

# Test the function with an example input
print(longestIdealString("acfgbd", 2))  # Expected output: 4
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n * k), where `n` is the length of the string `s` and `k` is the range constraint for adjacency. For each character in `s`, we check up to `2k+1` characters, resulting in O(n * k) operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since the `dp` array has a fixed size of 26, independent of the input size.

By applying these steps properly, we can solve the problem for the provided constraints efficiently.
