1371. Find the Longest Substring Containing Vowels in Even Counts

Given the string `s`, return the size of the longest substring containing each vowel an even number of times. That is, return the maximum length of a substring that contains all vowels (`'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, and `'u'`) an even number of times.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
    - Is the input string composed only of lowercase English letters? (Yes)
    - What is the maximum length of the string? (The length of the string can go up to 5 * 10^4)
      
2. **Output:**
    - Should the function return an integer representing the length of the longest valid substring? (Yes)

3. **Edge Cases:**
    - How should the function handle an empty string? (Return 0)
    - Should the function consider substrings that contain vowels in odd counts? (No, only substrings with all vowels in even counts are considered.)

## Strategy
1. Use a bitmask to track the evenness/oddness of vowels:
    - Each vowel can be represented as a bit in a 5-bit binary number.
    - For example, bit 0 for 'a', bit 1 for 'e', bit 2 for 'i', bit 3 for 'o', and bit 4 for 'u'.
    - As we go through the string, toggle the respective bit for each vowel encountered. This will allow tracking even/odd counts conveniently.
    
2. Utilize a hash map to store the first occurrence of each bitmask state:
    - Key: bitmask (integer from 0 to 31).
    - Value: index of the first occurrence of this bitmask.
    - This helps to efficiently find the length of valid substrings since a state encountered before means the substring between the two indices has vowels in even counts.

3. Traverse the string to update the bitmask state and check for the longest valid substring length.

4. Edge case handling:
    - If no valid substring exists that meets the criteria, return 0.

## Code
```python
def findTheLongestSubstring(s: str) -> int:
    # Mapping vowels to their respective bit positions
    vowel_to_bit = {'a': 1, 'e': 2, 'i': 4, 'o': 8, 'u': 16}
    
    # Dictionary to store the first occurrence index of each bitmask state
    bitmask_first_occurrence = {0: -1}
    
    bitmask = 0
    max_length = 0
    
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if char in vowel_to_bit:
            bitmask ^= vowel_to_bit[char]  # Toggle the bit for the current vowel
        
        if bitmask in bitmask_first_occurrence:
            max_length = max(max_length, i - bitmask_first_occurrence[bitmask])
        else:
            bitmask_first_occurrence[bitmask] = i
    
    return max_length

# Example usage:
example_input = "eleetminicoworoep"
print(findTheLongestSubstring(example_input))  # Output should be 13
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(N) where N is the length of the input string. We traverse the string once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) for the bitmask and O(min(N, 32)) for the hash map storing the first occurrences since there are only 32 possible states of bitmask (2^5 combinations for the 5 vowels). Thus, the space complexity is effectively constant with respect to the bitmask tracking.
