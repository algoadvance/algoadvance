title:  Pseudo-Palindromic Paths in a Binary Tree-out
permalink: /s1457
---

Given a binary tree where node values are digits from 1 to 9, a path from the root to a leaf is considered pseudo-palindromic if, at most, one digit has an odd frequency along the path. Return the number of pseudo-palindromic paths in the binary tree.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the definition of a leaf node in this context?**
   - A leaf node is a node with no children.

2. **What is meant by a path being pseudo-palindromic?**
   - A path is pseudo-palindromic if, along the path, at most one digit appears an odd number of times, which means the path can be rearranged to form a palindrome.

3. **Can the tree have null nodes?**
   - Yes, nodes can have null children which should be handled accordingly.

4. **What is the expected structure of the tree node?**
   - The tree node is typically part of a `TreeNode` class with attributes `val`, `left`, and `right`.

### Strategy

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: We'll use DFS to traverse the tree from the root to the leaf nodes.
2. **Frequency Tracking**: We will maintain a frequency counter (using a dictionary or an array) to track the occurrences of each digit along the current path.
3. **Check Pseudo-Palindromic Condition**: At each leaf node, we check if the path is pseudo-palindromic by counting the number of digits with odd frequencies.
4. **Backtracking**: We will backtrack to ensure that the frequency counter is accurate for each path.

### Code

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def pseudoPalindromicPaths (root: TreeNode) -> int:
    from collections import Counter
    
    def dfs(node, counter):
        if node is None:
            return 0
        
        # Update the frequency counter
        counter[node.val] += 1
        
        # Initialize the number of paths
        count_paths = 0
        
        # Check if we are at a leaf node
        if node.left is None and node.right is None:
            # Check for pseudo-palindromic path
            odd_count = sum(1 for count in counter.values() if count % 2 == 1)
            if odd_count <= 1:
                count_paths += 1
        else:
            # Continue DFS on the child nodes
            count_paths += dfs(node.left, counter)
            count_paths += dfs(node.right, counter)
        
        # Backtrack
        counter[node.val] -= 1
        
        return count_paths
    
    # Start DFS with an empty counter
    return dfs(root, Counter())

```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N)
  - Where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Every node is visited exactly once.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(H)
  - Where H is the height of the tree. This space is used by the recursion stack. In addition, the auxiliary space used by the counter can be considered O(1) since it holds at most 9 different keys (digits 1 to 9).
