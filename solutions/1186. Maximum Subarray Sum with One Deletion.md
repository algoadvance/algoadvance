title:  Maximum Subarray Sum with One Deletion-out
permalink: /s1186
---

Given an array of integers, you can perform at most one deletion on the array. Find the maximum possible sum of the subarray that can be obtained by performing this deletion. A subarray is defined as a contiguous block of elements in the original array.

**Example:**

- Input: `arr = [1, -2, 0, 3]`
- Output: `4`
- Explanation: Since we can perform at most one deletion, the optimal subarray is `[1, 0, 3]`, which sums to 4.

- Input: `arr = [1, -2, -2, 3]`
- Output: `3`
- Explanation: The optimal subarray is the subarray `[3]`, which sums to 3.

**Constraints:**

- The length of the array is between `1` and `10^5`.
- The elements in the array are between `-10^4` and `10^4`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there constraints on the values in the array?**
   - Yes, the elements are between `-10^4` and `10^4`.

2. **What should be returned if the array has only one element?**
   - You should return the element itself, since no deletion can be performed.

3. **Are negative numbers allowed in the array?**
   - Yes, both positive and negative numbers are allowed.

## Strategy

1. Use dynamic programming to maintain two states:
   - `dp_no_del[i]`: The maximum sum of subarrays ending at `i` without any deletions.
   - `dp_with_del[i]`: The maximum sum of subarrays ending at `i` with one element deleted.

2. Initialize:
   - `dp_no_del[0]` as `arr[0]` (only one element, no deletion).
   - `dp_with_del[0]` as `float('-inf')` (impossible to delete any element at the start).

3. Iterate the array from left to right updating the states using the following relations:
   - `dp_no_del[i] = max(dp_no_del[i-1] + arr[i], arr[i])`
   - `dp_with_del[i] = max(dp_with_del[i-1] + arr[i], dp_no_del[i-1])`

4. Track the maximum value among both states.

5. The answer will be the maximum value found in both `dp_no_del` and `dp_with_del`.

## Code

```python
def maximumSum(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    if n == 1:
        return arr[0]
    
    dp_no_del = [0] * n
    dp_with_del = [0] * n
    
    dp_no_del[0] = arr[0]
    dp_with_del[0] = float('-inf')
    
    max_sum = arr[0]
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        dp_no_del[i] = max(dp_no_del[i-1] + arr[i], arr[i])
        dp_with_del[i] = max(dp_with_del[i-1] + arr[i], dp_no_del[i-1])
        
        max_sum = max(max_sum, dp_no_del[i], dp_with_del[i])
    
    return max_sum
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` because we iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for storing `dp_no_del` and `dp_with_del`. This could be optimized to `O(1)` since we only need the previous state to compute the current one.
