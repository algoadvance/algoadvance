**Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column**

On a 2D plane, we place `n` stones at some integer coordinate points. Each coordinate point may have at most one stone.

A stone can be removed if it shares either the same row or the same column as another stone that has not been removed.

Given an array `stones` of length `n` where `stones[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the location of the ith stone, return the largest possible number of stones that can be removed.

### Example:
```
Input: stones = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
Output: 5
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= stones.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= xi, yi <= 10^4`
- No two stones are at the same coordinate point.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the stones be removed in any order?
2. Is there any specific method to follow for removing stones that maximizes the count of removals?
3. Are `xi` and `yi` non-negative integers?

## Strategy
The problem can be translated into finding the maximum number of connected components in a graph where each node is a stone and there is an edge between any two stones that share the same row or column. The goal is to count how many nodes (stones) can be removed, which is all nodes except the count of connected components.

Here is the high-level strategy:
1. Treat each stone's position as a node in a graph.
2. Create edges between nodes if they share the same row or column.
3. Use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Union-Find to find the number of connected components.
4. The maximum number of stones that can be removed is the total number of stones minus the number of connected components.

### Code
First, we will implement the solution using the Union-Find data structure:

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self):
        self.parent = {}
        self.rank = {}
        self.count = 0

    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]

    def union(self, x, y):
        rootX = self.find(x)
        rootY = self.find(y)

        if rootX != rootY:
            if self.rank[rootX] > self.rank[rootY]:
                self.parent[rootY] = rootX
            elif self.rank[rootX] < self.rank[rootY]:
                self.parent[rootX] = rootY
            else:
                self.parent[rootY] = rootX
                self.rank[rootX] += 1
                
            self.count -= 1
    
    def add(self, x):
        if x not in self.parent:
            self.parent[x] = x
            self.rank[x] = 0
            self.count += 1

def removeStones(stones):
    uf = UnionFind()
    
    for x, y in stones:
        uf.add(x)
        uf.add(~y)  # Use ~y to separate column indices to avoid conflict with row indices.
        uf.union(x, ~y)
    
    return len(stones) - uf.count
    
# Example usage:
stones = [[0,0],[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1],[2,2]]
print(removeStones(stones))  # Output: 5
```

### Time Complexity
- **Union-Find operations**: Each `find` and `union` operation can be considered almost constant time, due to path compression and union by rank.
- Initializing the Union-Find data structure and processing each stone involves O(n) operations, where n is the number of stones.
- Therefore, overall time complexity is \(O(n)\).

With this solution, we are efficiently finding the largest number of stones that can be removed by leveraging the Union-Find structure to keep track of connected components.
