title:  Find Occurrences of an Element in an Array-out
permalink: /s3159
---

Given a sorted array of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, find the number of occurrences of `target` in `arr`.

### Example
```python
Input: arr = [1,2,2,2,3,4,5], target = 2
Output: 3
```
```python
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4,5], target = 6
Output: 0
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the array always sorted?**
   - Yes, the array is always sorted.

2. **Can the array contain duplicate elements?**
   - Yes, the array may contain duplicate elements.

3. **What should be the return value if the target element is not present in the array?**
   - The return value should be `0`.

4. **Are there any constraints on the size of the array?**
   - There might be typical constraints like the size fitting into memory, but no specific limits mentioned. We can assume it can be very large.

5. **Should we consider integer overflow or negative numbers?**
   - Since it's a Python-based problem, integer overflow is generally not an issue. The array could contain negative numbers.

## Strategy

Given that the array is sorted, we can leverage binary search to efficiently solve this problem.

### Approach:

1. **Binary Search for the First Occurrence:**
   - Use binary search to find the first occurrence of `target`.
   
2. **Binary Search for the Last Occurrence:**
   - Use binary search to find the last occurrence of `target`.

3. **Calculate Occurrences:**
   - The number of occurrences of `target` is `last_occurrence - first_occurrence + 1`.

### Steps:

1. Implement a helper function `find_first_occurrence` to locate the first instance of `target`.
2. Implement a helper function `find_last_occurrence` to locate the last instance of `target`.
3. Use these two helper functions to determine the occurrence count.

### Time Complexity

Both the `find_first_occurrence` and `find_last_occurrence` functions run in O(log n) time due to the binary search approach. Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(log n)`.

## Code

```python
def find_first_occurrence(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    first_occurrence = -1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            first_occurrence = mid
            right = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return first_occurrence

def find_last_occurrence(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    last_occurrence = -1
    while left <= right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            last_occurrence = mid
            left = mid + 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return last_occurrence

def count_occurrences(arr, target):
    first_occurrence = find_first_occurrence(arr, target)
    if first_occurrence == -1:
        return 0
    last_occurrence = find_last_occurrence(arr, target)
    return last_occurrence - first_occurrence + 1

# Example usage:
print(count_occurrences([1,2,2,2,3,4,5], 2))  # Output: 3
print(count_occurrences([1,2,3,4,5], 6))      # Output: 0
```

## Explanation

1. **`find_first_occurrence` Function:**
   - Conducts binary search to locate the first occurrence of `target`. Continues searching towards the left even if `target` is found, to ensure it is the first position of the target.

2. **`find_last_occurrence` Function:**
   - Similar to `find_first_occurrence` but focuses on finding the last occurrence, searching towards the right.

3. **`count_occurrences` Function:**
   - Utilizes both helper functions to calculate and return the count of occurrences of the `target`.

This approach ensures an efficient solution with a time complexity of `O(log n)`.
