title:  Stone Game VI-out

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

There are `n` stones in a pile. On each player's turn, that player removes any number of stones between 1 and `k` inclusive from the pile. The player who removes the last stone from the pile wins.

Given two arrays `aliceValues` and `bobValues`, where `aliceValues[i]` and `bobValues[i]` represent the values Alice and Bob gain, respectively, when the `i`-th stone is chosen.

Alice and Bob will each try to maximize their own score.

Return:
- `1` if Alice wins,
- `-1` if Bob wins, or
- `0` if they both have the same score.

## Examples
```python
Example 1:
Input: aliceValues = [1,3,5], bobValues = [2,4,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: Alice wins by removing the first stone, Bob wins by removing the second stone, and Alice wins by removing the last stone. Both get a total score of 9.

Example 2:
Input: aliceValues = [1,2], bobValues = [3,1]
Output: 1
```

# Clarifying Questions
1. Are both arrays `aliceValues` and `bobValues` guaranteed to be the same length?
   - Yes, both arrays will have the same length `n`.
2. Is the number of stones in `k` fixed throughout the game?
   - Yes, players can only remove stones between 1 and `k` inclusive on each turn.

# Strategy
1. Create tuples for each stone where each tuple consists of the sum of Alice's and Bob's values, Alice's value, and Bob's value.
2. Sort these tuples by the sum of values in descending order.
3. Initialize scores for both Alice and Bob to zero.
4. Iterate through the sorted list, and for each stone, alternate turns for Alice and Bob:
   - Alice picks the stone if it's her turn and adds to her score
   - Bob picks the stone if itâ€™s his turn and adds to his score
5. Compare the scores and return the appropriate result.

This strategy ensures that we are always considering the stones that maximize the combined value first, which should balance the prioritization for both players.

# Time Complexity
1. Sorting the array is O(n log n).
2. Iterating through the sorted list is O(n).

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n log n).

# Code
```python
def stoneGameVI(aliceValues, bobValues):
    combined = sorted([(a + b, a, b) for a, b in zip(aliceValues, bobValues)], reverse=True)
    
    alice_score, bob_score = 0, 0
    for i, (_, a, b) in enumerate(combined):
        if i % 2 == 0:
            alice_score += a
        else:
            bob_score += b

    if alice_score > bob_score:
        return 1
    elif bob_score > alice_score:
        return -1
    else:
        return 0

# Example usage
print(stoneGameVI([1,3,5], [2,4,1]))   # Output: 0
print(stoneGameVI([1,2], [3,1]))       # Output: 1
```

This implementation should handle the given problem statement efficiently and correctly, providing a solid approach to determine the winner of the game based on the values they gain from each stone.
