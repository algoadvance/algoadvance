title:  Sum of Nodes with Even-Valued Grandparent-out
permalink: /s1315
---
Given a binary tree, return the sum of values of nodes with an even-valued grandparent. A grandparent of a node is the parent of its parent if it exists. Consider only the nodes' values when the grandparent node's value is even.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Does the binary tree contain only integer values, and can these values be negative?
   - **A**: Yes, the binary tree contains only integer values, and these values can be negative.

2. **Q**: What should be returned if the tree is empty?
   - **A**: If the tree is empty, the sum should be 0.

3. **Q**: Will the values of the nodes be unique in the tree?
   - **A**: The problem does not specify that node values need to be unique, so we should assume they may not be.

### Strategy
We will traverse the binary tree and check the value of the grandparent for each node. If the grandparent exists and its value is even, we add the node's value to the total sum.

We can use Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree. While traversing, we pass down information about the current node's parent and grandparent so that we can evaluate the value of any node's grandparent when we visit it.

The steps are:
1. Define a helper function that performs DFS on the tree.
2. Pass the current node along with its parent and grandparent to this helper function.
3. If the grandparent's value is even, add the current node's value to the sum.
4. Continue this process recursively for the left and right children.
5. Return the sum after traversing all nodes.

### Code
```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def sumEvenGrandparent(root: TreeNode) -> int:
    def dfs(node: TreeNode, parent: TreeNode, grandparent: TreeNode) -> int:
        if not node:
            return 0
        
        sum_ = 0
        if grandparent and grandparent.val % 2 == 0:
            sum_ += node.val
        
        # Traverse the left and right children
        sum_ += dfs(node.left, node, parent)
        sum_ += dfs(node.right, node, parent)
        
        return sum_
    
    return dfs(root, None, None)

```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the binary tree. This is the space used by the call stack during the DFS traversal. In the worst case (skewed tree), H can be N in the case of a completely unbalanced tree.
