title:  Single Element in a Sorted Array-out
permalink: /s540
---
Given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once, find this single element that appears only once.

You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:** What is the range of the length of the array? (e.g., Is it small enough to consider edge cases, or large enough that performance concerns are significant?)
2. **Input Format:** Is the array always non-empty and guaranteed to contain the single element?

### Code
```python
def singleNonDuplicate(nums):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    
    while left < right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        
        # Ensuring we are always at the start of a pair
        if mid % 2 == 1:
            mid -= 1
        
        if nums[mid] == nums[mid + 1]:
            left = mid + 2
        else:
            right = mid
    
    return nums[left]
```

### Strategy
1. **Binary Search Approach:**
   - Use binary search to find the single element.
   - Given the sorted nature of the array, pairs should start at even indexes (e.g., `0, 2, 4, ...`) and their other element at the next odd index (`1, 3, 5, ...`).
   - While traversing, adjust the search space based on where pairs start and whether we've encountered a pair mismatch.
   
2. **Steps Explanation:**
    - Initialize two pointers `left` at `0` and `right` at `length of nums - 1`.
    - Compute the `mid` index.
    - Ensure that `mid` is always the start of a pair by making `mid` even, if itâ€™s odd then decrement it by 1.
    - Check if the element at `mid` is the same as the element at `mid + 1`:
      - If it is, then the single element is further down the second half, hence, update `left` to `mid + 2`.
      - Otherwise, it means the single element is somewhere in the first half, hence, update `right` to `mid`.
    - Lastly, when `left` equals `right`, that index will hold the single element.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n) as it uses a binary search methodology.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) since no additional space except for a few variables is used.

This ensures that the solution is both efficient and within the constraints specified.
