title:  Find the Smallest Divisor Given a Threshold-out
permalink: /s1283
---
Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `threshold`, the task is to find the smallest integer `divisor` such that the result of summing each number in `nums` divided by the divisor (with each result rounded up to the nearest integer) is less than or equal to the `threshold`.

More formally, we need to find the smallest integer `divisor` such that:
```
sum(ceil(nums[i] / divisor)) for i in range(len(nums)) <= threshold
```

Example:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,5,9], threshold = 6
Output: 5
Explanation: We can use a divisor of 5:
  ceil(1/5) + ceil(2/5) + ceil(5/5) + ceil(9/5) = 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 5, which is <= 6.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the `nums` array contain negative integers?**
   - No, `nums` will only contain positive integers according to the problem constraints.

2. **Is there a specific range for the elements in `nums` and the `threshold`?**
   - Yes, typically the constraints will be such that `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6` and `1 <= threshold <= 10^6`.

3. **How should we handle very large arrays?**
   - The solution should be optimized for performance, possibly using binary search.

## Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a binary search approach to find the smallest possible divisor. Here's the detailed approach:
1. **Define the Search Space:**
   - The minimum possible value for the divisor is `1`.
   - The maximum possible value for the divisor is the maximum value in the `nums` array.
   
2. **Binary Search:**
   - Use binary search within the defined range.
   - For each mid-point in the current range, calculate the sum as defined and adjust the range based on whether the sum is less than, equal to, or greater than the threshold.
   
3. **Helper Function:**
   - Define a helper function to calculate the sum of the ceiling divided results for a given divisor.

## Code
Here is the Python implementation for the above approach:

```python
import math

def smallestDivisor(nums, threshold):
    def compute_sum(divisor):
        return sum(math.ceil(num / divisor) for num in nums)

    left, right = 1, max(nums)
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if compute_sum(mid) > threshold:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid
    return left

# Example usage
nums = [1, 2, 5, 9]
threshold = 6
print(smallestDivisor(nums, threshold))  # Output: 5
```

## Time Complexity
- **Binary Search:** The binary search runs in \(O(\log(max(nums)))\) time where `max(nums)` is the maximum value in the nums array.
- **Sum Calculation:** Each computation of the sum requires \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the nums array.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log(max(nums)))\).

This solution is efficient given the problem constraints and should handle large arrays and high values within reasonable limits.
