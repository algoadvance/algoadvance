title:  Minimum Number of Taps to Open to Water a Garden-out
permalink: /s1326
---

You are given a one-dimensional garden represented by an integer `n`, which means the garden extends from point 0 to point `n`. There are `n + 1` taps located at points `[0, 1, 2, ..., n]` in the garden.

Given an integer array `ranges` of length `n + 1` where `ranges[i]` (0-indexed) means the `i-th` tap can water the area `[i - ranges[i], i + ranges[i]]` if it is open, return the minimum number of taps that need to be open to water the entire garden, or return `-1` if the garden cannot be watered fully.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can one tap's coverage extend beyond the boundaries of the garden (i.e., can a tap at point 0 cover a negative point)?
   - Yes, but the coverage would effectively start at 0.

2. What should be returned if the garden cannot be fully watered by any combination of the taps?
   - Return `-1`.

3. Can we assume that all values in `ranges` are non-negative integers?
   - Yes, all values in `ranges` are non-negative.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy algorithm combined with the "jump game" technique, similar to solving the problem of finding the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of an array. Here's a step-by-step strategy:

1. **Intervals Transformation**: First, transform the `ranges` array into an array of intervals, where each tap at position `i` covers `[i - ranges[i], i + ranges[i]]`.

2. **Sorting Intervals**: Sort these intervals based on their starting points. If two intervals have the same starting point, the one with the larger endpoint should come first.

3. **Jump Game Strategy**: Use a greedy approach to determine the minimum number of intervals needed to cover the entire range `[0, n]`. This is similar to the jump game where you want to find the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the array.

### Code

```python
def minTaps(n, ranges):
    intervals = []
    
    # Create intervals based on the range for each tap.
    for i in range(n + 1):
        start = max(0, i - ranges[i])
        end = min(n, i + ranges[i])
        intervals.append((start, end))
    
    # Sort intervals based on their start, tie-breaker on the end (in descending order for end).
    intervals.sort()
    
    taps_opened = 0
    end_reached = 0
    next_end = 0
    i = 0

    while end_reached < n:
        # Find the farthest reach within the current range
        while i <= n and intervals[i][0] <= end_reached:
            next_end = max(next_end, intervals[i][1])
            i += 1
        
        # If we can't extend the range any further
        if next_end == end_reached:
            return -1
        
        # Move to the farthest we can reach in this step
        taps_opened += 1
        end_reached = next_end
    
    return taps_opened

# Example usage:
n = 5
ranges = [3, 4, 1, 1, 0, 0]
print(minTaps(n, ranges))  # Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the intervals**: `O(n log n)`, as we need to sort the intervals based on the starting point.
- **Iterating through the intervals**: `O(n)`, as we iterate over the sorted list of intervals to find the minimum number of taps.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`. This approach ensures that we efficiently find the minimum number of taps needed to water the whole garden.
