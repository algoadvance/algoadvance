title:  Amount of Time for Binary Tree to Be Infected-out
permalink: /s2385
---

You are given the `root` of a binary tree with `n` nodes and a node named `start`. At second `0`, an infection starts at the `start` node and spreads to all directly connected nodes. Each second, the infection spreads to all uninfected nodes that are directly connected to currently infected nodes.

Return the number of seconds needed for the entire tree to be infected.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Clarify Input/Output:**
    - **Input:**
        - A binary tree represented by its root node.
        - An integer `start` value which corresponds to the node where the infection starts.
    - **Output:**
        - An integer representing the number of seconds required to infect the entire tree.
2. **Constraints:**
    - Are there any constraints on the node values (e.g., node values are unique)?
    - Are the values of the node positive integers?
3. **Tree Properties:**
    - Is the tree always rooted, or can the infection start at any node?
    - Can we assume the tree is balanced or unbalanced?

## Strategy

1. **Tree Traversal and Mapping:**
    - Use BFS (Breadth-First Search) to ensure all nodes are visited level by level.
    - Create a graph-like adjacency structure (using a dictionary) where each node points to its connected nodes (both children and parent).
   
2. **Infection Simulation Using BFS:**
    - Use another BFS to simulate the infection spread from the `start` node.
    - Implement a boolean array or set to keep track of infected nodes.
    - Count the time steps required to infect all nodes.

## Code

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def amountOfTime(root: TreeNode, start: int) -> int:
    if not root:
        return 0
    
    # Step 1: Build adjacency list representation of the tree
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    
    # BFS to build the graph
    def build_graph(node):
        if not node:
            return
        if node.left:
            graph[node.val].append(node.left.val)
            graph[node.left.val].append(node.val)
            build_graph(node.left)
        if node.right:
            graph[node.val].append(node.right.val)
            graph[node.right.val].append(node.val)
            build_graph(node.right)
    
    build_graph(root)
    
    # Step 2: BFS to find the time required to infect the whole tree
    queue = deque([start])
    visited = set()
    visited.add(start)
    time = 0
    
    while queue:
        for _ in range(len(queue)):
            current = queue.popleft()
            for neighbor in graph[current]:
                if neighbor not in visited:
                    visited.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append(neighbor)
        if queue:
            time += 1
    
    return time

# Example Usage
# Constructing a sample tree:
#         1
#        / \
#       2   3
#      / \
#     4   5
root = TreeNode(1, TreeNode(2, TreeNode(4), TreeNode(5)), TreeNode(3))
start = 3
print(amountOfTime(root, start))  # Output should be 2 in this example
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Graph Construction:** 
    - Building the graph takes O(n) time where n is the number of nodes, because we are visiting each node exactly once.
   
2. **Infection Simulation:** 
    - The second BFS also takes O(n) time, because each node and each edge is processed once.

**Overall Time Complexity:** O(n)

**Space Complexity:**
- The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage required for the graph representation, queue, and visited set.
