title:  Minimum Size Subarray in Infinite Array-out
permalink: /s2875
---

You are given an array `nums` and an integer `target`. The array `nums` is infinitely repeated. Return the length of the shortest subarray which has a sum of at least `target`.

If there is no subarray with a sum of at least `target`, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the elements of the array only positive integers, or can they be negative as well?**
    - Elements are positive integers.
2. **What is the length of the array `nums`?**
    - The length of the array can vary but is generally within the constraints of typical input sizes used in coding problems.
3. **Does the infinite repetition mean we should consider the array as cyclic?**
    - Yes, you can imagine the array repeating infinitely in a cyclic manner.
4. **What is the range of the `target` value?**
    - The `target` is a positive integer.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Key Patterns:** Given that `nums` is infinitely repeated, we need to focus on finding a subarray within this structure that meets the sum condition.
2. **Sliding Window Technique:** Use the sliding window technique to find the minimal length subarray with a sum of at least `target`. This is feasible because the sliding window can efficiently narrow down the smallest qualifying subarray by adjusting its start and end pointers.
3. **Handling Infinite Array:** To handle the infinite nature, we simulate the array repetition up to the required length that could possibly contain the minimal subarray.

### Code

```python
def min_size_subarray(nums, target):
    n = len(nums)
    total_sum = sum(nums)
    
    # If total sum is already greater than or equal to target
    if total_sum >= target:
        return 1

    results = float('inf')
    current_sum = 0
    left = 0

    # We may need to go through the array more than once, so loop until a condition is met
    for right in range(2 * n):
        current_sum += nums[right % n]
        
        while current_sum >= target:
            results = min(results, right - left + 1)
            current_sum -= nums[left % n]
            left += 1
            
            # Early exit if we found the smallest possible window
            if results == 1:
                return results

    return results if results != float('inf') else -1

# Example Usage
nums = [1, 2, 3]
target = 7
print(min_size_subarray(nums, target))  # Output should be 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. The use of the sliding window ensures that each element is processed at most twice, resulting in linear complexity relative to the length of the array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as the primary space used is for the few extra variables and the window size handling, irrespective of the input size.

The sliding window approach efficiently narrows down our search space while managing the constraints of the infinite repetition of the array.
