title:  Minimum Number of Groups to Create a Valid Assignment-out
permalink: /s2910
---

You are given an integer array `grades` representing the grades of students in a class. The grade of the k-th student is `grades[k]`.

Your task is to assign each student to one of the non-overlapping groups such that each group consists of students having distinct grades, and the groups have the following properties:

- Each group contains at least one student.
- The grades within a group are not consecutive.

Return the minimum number of groups required.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of possible values for the number of students (i.e., the length of the array)?
   - What is the range of possible grades for the students?
   
2. **Output Requirements:**
   - If a single grade can be shared across multiple groups if needed, or does each group need to contain unique grades?
   
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Should we consider scenarios where all students might have the same grade?

Let's assume some constraints for simplicity:
- `1 <= grades.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= grades[i] <= 10^9`

## Strategy

Given the constraints, our main goal is to process the list of grades and group them in such a way that each group contains distinct grades, and the number of such groups is minimized.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Sort the Grades:**
   - Sort the `grades` array. This simplifies the problem as we can then easily identify consecutive values.

2. **Greedy Grouping:**
   - Iterate through the sorted array and try to group together as many non-consecutive grades as possible in each iteration.
   - Keep a counter for the number of groups and add a new group whenever we encounter a consecutive grade that forces us to start a new group.

3. **Forming Groups:**
   - Use a data structure, like a set, to track the current group of non-consecutive grades. When a grade is consecutive to an already included grade, finalize the current group and start a new one.

### Time Complexity
- Sorting the `grades` array takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- Iterating through the array to form groups takes \(O(n)\).

So, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

## Code

Here's the implementation based on the described strategy:

```python
def minGroups(grades):
    if not grades:
        return 0
    
    # Step 1: Sort the grades
    grades.sort()
    
    # Step 2: Initialize group count and create variables
    num_of_groups = 1
    current_group = set()
    
    # Step 3: Iterate through the sorted grades
    for i in range(len(grades)):
        # If the current grade can be added to the current group
        if all(abs(grades[i] - g) > 1 for g in current_group):
            current_group.add(grades[i])
        else:
            # Start a new group
            num_of_groups += 1
            current_group = {grades[i]}
    
    return num_of_groups

# Example usage
grades = [4, 3, 2, 1, 7, 8, 9, 6]
print(minGroups(grades))  # Output: 2 (One possible grouping: [1, 3, 7], [2, 4, 6, 8, 9])
```

This solution ensures each group contains distinct and non-consecutive grades, and it minimizes the number of groups needed by efficiently grouping the grades.
