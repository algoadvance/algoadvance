title:  Find a Peak Element II-out
permalink: /s1901
---

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `mat` where `mat[i][j]` could be any real number. We define a peak element to be an element that is larger than or equal to all of its adjacent neighbors in the grid. The adjacent neighbors are the elements on its top, bottom, left, and right. 

A peak element in `mat` is guaranteed to exist. You need to find any peak element `mat[i][j]` and return the indices `[i, j]`.

#### Example:
```text
Input: mat = [[1,4],[3,2]]
Output: [0,1]
Explanation: 4 is a peak element.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What defines the boundaries of the matrix in terms of adjacency?**
   - Elements on the boundary of the matrix are considered to have fewer neighbors corresponding to their position.

2. **Do we need to find all peaks or just any one?**
   - We just need to find any peak element, as stated.

3. **Are there any constraints on the dimensions of `m` and `n`?**
   - `1 <= m, n <= 1000`

### Strategy

A good approach for this problem is to utilize a modified binary search approach to efficiently find a peak element.

1. **Column Search Using Binary Search**:
   - We perform a binary search on the columns.
   - For the middle column, find the global maximum element.
   - Compare the maximum element with its left and right neighbors.
   - Based on the comparison, decide which half of the matrix to continue the search in.
   - Repeat until we find a peak.

### Code

```python
def findPeakGrid(mat):
    def findMaxColIndex(row):
        max_index = 0
        for j in range(len(row)):
            if row[j] > row[max_index]:
                max_index = j
        return max_index

    top, bottom = 0, len(mat) - 1
    
    while top <= bottom:
        mid_row = (top + bottom) // 2
        max_col_index = findMaxColIndex(mat[mid_row])
        
        # Check if it's peak by comparing with neighbors
        mid_val = mat[mid_row][max_col_index]
        up_val = mat[mid_row-1][max_col_index] if mid_row > 0 else -1
        down_val = mat[mid_row+1][max_col_index] if mid_row < len(mat) - 1 else -1
        
        if mid_val > up_val and mid_val > down_val:
            return [mid_row, max_col_index]
        elif mid_val < up_val:
            bottom = mid_row - 1
        else:
            top = mid_row + 1

# Example Usage
mat = [[1,4],[3,2]]
print(findPeakGrid(mat))  # Output: [0, 1]
```

### Time Complexity

- Binary search on rows: \(O(\log m)\)
- Finding the max in a row: \(O(n)\)

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log m)\), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. This is efficient and suitable given the problem constraints.
