title:  Fraction Addition and Subtraction-out
permalink: /s592
---

You are given a string expression representing an expression of fractions. The fractions will be added and subtracted. The fraction values are provided as a string format "a/b" where a is the numerator and b is the non-zero denominator. The input string is an expression where the fractions are joined by '+' or '-'.

Your task is to return the result of this expression in its simplest form as a string in the format "numerator/denominator".

```
Example 1:
Input: expression = "-1/2+1/2"
Output: "0/1"

Example 2:
Input: expression = "-1/2+1/2+1/3"
Output: "1/3"

Example 3:
Input: expression = "1/3-1/2"
Output: "-1/6"
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Will the input always be a valid expression?
   **A:** Yes, the input string expression will always be a valid fraction expression as per the problem constraints.
   
2. **Q:** How should we handle zero denominators?
   **A:** Each fraction will have a non-zero denominator as per the problem constraints.

3. **Q:** What is the maximum length of the input expression?
   **A:** The problem does not specify, but we should assume it can be relatively large, but manageable within typical constraints for algorithmic problems on LeetCode.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we will:
1. Parse the given expression to separate each fraction component.
2. Convert all fractions to have a common denominator.
3. Perform the addition or subtraction of the numerators.
4. Simplify the resulting fraction by dividing both numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

Steps:
1. Tokenize the input expression to get all numerators and denominators.
2. Use Python's `fractions.Fraction` to handle the arithmetic of fractions and simplify them.

## Code
```python
from fractions import Fraction

def fractionAddition(expression: str) -> str:
    # Split the expression into components of fractions, while preserving +/- signs
    fractions = []
    i = 0
    n = len(expression)
    
    while i < n:
        # Read the sign (either + or -)
        if expression[i] in '+-':
            sign = 1 if expression[i] == '+' else -1
            i += 1
        else:
            sign = 1
        
        # Read the fraction
        start = i
        while i < n and expression[i] != '+' and expression[i] != '-':
            i += 1
        
        numerator, denominator = expression[start:i].split('/')
        numerator = sign * int(numerator)
        denominator = int(denominator)
        fractions.append(Fraction(numerator, denominator))
    
    # Sum all fractions
    result = sum(fractions, start=Fraction(0, 1))
    
    # Convert result to string in the form "numerator/denominator"
    return f"{result.numerator}/{result.denominator}"

# Test Cases
print(fractionAddition("-1/2+1/2"))          # Output: "0/1"
print(fractionAddition("-1/2+1/2+1/3"))      # Output: "1/3"
print(fractionAddition("1/3-1/2"))           # Output: "-1/6"
```

## Time Complexity

- **Parsing:** O(n) where n is the length of the input string (since we are iterating through the string once).
- **Summation of Fractions:** Given that we are using the `fractions.Fraction` class, which is designed to handle arithmetic and simplification of fractions efficiently, its time complexity can be considered O(1) for each fractional operation. However, summing `k` fractions can involve dealing with larger numerators and denominators as intermediates.
- **Overall:** The primary complexity lies in parsing the input expression and the number of fractional operations. Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
