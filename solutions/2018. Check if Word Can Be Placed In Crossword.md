title:  Check if Word Can Be Placed In Crossword-out
permalink: /s2018
---

Given a matrix of characters `board` representing a crossword puzzle, and a string `word`, check if the word can be placed into the crossword puzzle according to the following rules:
1. The word must be placed horizontally or vertically.
2. The word must not overlap any non-empty cells unless they contain the same letter as the word at that position.
3. Empty cells are represented by the character `' '`.
4. Non-empty cells are represented by lowercase English letters.

You need to return `True` if the word can be placed on the board, and `False` otherwise.

**Example:**
```
Input: board = [["#", " ", "#"], 
               [" ", " ", "#"], 
               ["#", "c", " "]], word = "abc"
Output: True
Explanation: The word "abc" can be placed vertically at (1,0).
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are word placements allowed only at the start of a row or column, or can they be within the middle provided they fit?
2. Should the checking be case-sensitive or is case-insensitivity allowed?
3. Is the length of the word guaranteed to not be more than the board dimensions?

Assuming the following:
- Only lowercase English letters are involved.
- The word can be placed anywhere within the row or column provided they fit.

## Strategy

1. **Horizontal and Vertical Check:** We need to iterate through each possible starting cell on the board to place the word both horizontally and vertically.
2. **Validation:** For each potential start, check:
    - If the word fits within the bounds.
    - If empty cells or matching characters exist for each character of the word.

The algorithm will involve:
- Iterating through all cells of the board.
- For each cell, try placing the word horizontally and vertically if the starting cell isn't '#' and proceed only if the cell fits.

## Code

Here is the implementation in Python:

```python
def canPlaceWord(board, word, x, y, horizontal):
    for i in range(len(word)):
        if horizontal:
            if y + i >= len(board[0]) or (board[x][y + i] != ' ' and board[x][y + i] != word[i]):
                return False
        else:
            if x + i >= len(board) or (board[x + i][y] != ' ' and board[x + i][y] != word[i]):
                return False
    # Check that there's no extra letter blocking the placement
    if horizontal:
        if (y > 0 and board[x][y - 1] == word[0]) or (y + len(word) < len(board[0]) and board[x][y + len(word)] == word[-1]):
            return False
    else:
        if (x > 0 and board[x - 1][y] == word[0]) or (x + len(word) < len(board) and board[x + len(word)][y] == word[-1]):
            return False
    return True

def placeWordInCrossword(board, word):
    rows = len(board)
    cols = len(board[0])
    
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            # Check horizontal placement forward
            if placeWordInCrossword(board, word, i, j, True):
                return True
            # Check horizontal placement backward
            if placeWordInCrossword(board, word[::-1], i, j, True):
                return True
            # Check vertical placement downward
            if placeWordInCrossword(board, word, i, j, False):
                return True
            # Check vertical placement upward
            if placeWordInCrossword(board, word[::-1], i, j, False):
                return True
                
    return False
```

## Time Complexity

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) because we are not using any additional data structure.
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(m \times n \times k)\), where \(m\) and \(n\) are the dimensions of the board, and \(k\) is the length of the word. This accounts for checking each cell, attempting to place the word horizontally and vertically, and checking backwards as well.
