title:  Minimum Moves to Pick K Ones-out
permalink: /s3086
---

You are given a binary string `s` and an integer `k`. In one move, you can select any substring of `s` and toggle all the characters in that substring, i.e., change all `0`s to `1`s and all `1`s to `0`s. Return the minimum number of moves needed to make at least `k` characters equal to `1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can `s` be empty?
   - Answer: No, the string will have a minimum length of 1.
   
2. What should be returned if `k` is 0?
   - Answer: If `k` is 0, the minimum moves should be 0 since no action is needed.
   
3. Can `k` be larger than the length of `s`?
   - Answer: No, `k` will always be within the range from 0 to the length of `s`.

## Code

```python
def minMoves(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    if k == 0:
        return 0
    
    ones_indices = [i for i, char in enumerate(s) if char == '1']
    n = len(ones_indices)
    
    if k > n:
        return -1  # Not enough ones to satisfy the condition

    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + ones_indices[i]
    
    min_moves = float('inf')
    for i in range(n - k + 1):
        left = i
        right = i + k - 1

        mid = (left + right) // 2
        cost_left = ones_indices[mid] * (mid - left) - (prefix_sum[mid] - prefix_sum[left])
        cost_right = (prefix_sum[right + 1] - prefix_sum[mid + 1]) - ones_indices[mid] * (right - mid)
        total_cost = cost_left + cost_right
        
        min_moves = min(min_moves, total_cost)
    
    return min_moves
```

## Strategy

1. **Identify Indices of '1's:** We first identify the indices of all `1` characters in the string `s`.

2. **Prefix Sum Calculation:** Construct a prefix sum array for the indices to quickly sum ranges.

3. **Sliding Window Over '1's Indices:** We use a sliding window of size `k` to find the minimum cost to make `k` characters `1`.

4. **Cost Calculation:** For each window, calculate the cost to bring all `1`s within the window closer to the median `1` in that window. This ensures the move cost is minimized using the prefix sum to calculate costs efficiently.

## Time Complexity

- **Index Gathering:** O(n) where n is the length of the string `s`.
- **Prefix Sum Array Calculation:** O(m) where m is the number of `1`s in `s`.
- **Sliding Window Calculation:** O(m) as it iterates over the `1` indices only once and performs constant time operations inside the loop.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n + m)**. Here, `n` is the length of the string and `m` is the number of `1`s in the string, making the approach efficient.
