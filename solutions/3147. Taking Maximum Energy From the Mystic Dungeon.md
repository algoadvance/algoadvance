title:  Taking Maximum Energy From the Mystic Dungeon-out
permalink: /s3147

### Problem Statement

In the Mystic Dungeon, you are given a grid of integers where each cell contains a certain amount of energy (may be positive, negative, or zero). You start from the top-left corner of the grid and your goal is to move to the bottom-right corner of the grid. From any cell, you can only move right or down. 

You need to determine the maximum energy you can collect by the time you reach the bottom-right corner of the grid.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the energy values be negative or zero?
2. Are there any constraints on the size of the grid?
3. Is it possible for the grid to contain obstacles or impassable cells, or are all cells accessible?

For this problem, let's assume:
- You can have negative, zero, or positive energy in each cell.
- Energy values will be constrained to small integers within the range of [-100, 100].
- The grid size is not exceedingly large (up to 100x100).

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming (DP):
1. Initialize a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum energy that can be collected to reach cell `(i, j)`.
2. Start by setting `dp[0][0]` to the value of `grid[0][0]`.
3. For each cell `(i, j)`, determine the maximum energy by considering the cells directly above `(i-1, j)` and to the left of `(i, j-1)`.
4. The result will be the value at `dp[-1][-1]` which gives us the maximum energy that can be collected to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid.

### Code

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
def max_energy(grid):
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0
    
    rows = len(grid)
    cols = len(grid[0])
    
    # Initialize a DP table with the same dimensions as grid
    dp = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    
    # Starting point
    dp[0][0] = grid[0][0]
    
    # Initialize first row and first column of dp table
    for i in range(1, cols):
        dp[0][i] = dp[0][i - 1] + grid[0][i]
    for j in range(1, rows):
        dp[j][0] = dp[j - 1][0] + grid[j][0]
    
    # Fill the rest of the dp table
    for i in range(1, rows):
        for j in range(1, cols):
            dp[i][j] = max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]) + grid[i][j]
    
    # The result is the maximum energy to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid
    return dp[-1][-1]

# Example Usage
grid = [
    [0, -2, -3, 1],
    [-1, 4, -2, 2],
    [3, -4, 2, 1],
    [1, -2, 2, -1]
]
print(max_energy(grid))  # Output will be the maximum energy that can be collected
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this dynamic programming solution is \(O(rows \times cols)\) because we need to iterate over every cell in the grid once to compute the values of the DP table. Here, `rows` and `cols` represent the number of rows and columns in the grid, respectively. The space complexity is also \(O(rows \times cols)\) due to the storage required for the DP table.
