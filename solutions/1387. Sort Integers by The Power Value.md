title:  Sort Integers by The Power Value-out
permalink: /s1387
---

The power of an integer `x` is defined as the number of steps needed to transform `x` into 1 using the following steps:
- If `x` is even, `x = x / 2`
- If `x` is odd, `x = 3 * x + 1`

Given three integers `lo`, `hi`, and `k`, you need to sort all integers in the interval `[lo, hi]` by the power value in ascending order, and then return the `k-th` integer in the sorted list.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Inputs**: Are `lo`, `hi`, and `k` guaranteed to have valid values such that `lo <= hi` and `1 <= k <= hi - lo + 1`?
   - Yes, assume the inputs are valid as per the problem constraints.

2. **Change in Step**: Should the intermediate results be cached to improve performance?
   - Yes, using a memoization technique can optimize the calculation of power values.

### Strategy

1. **Power Calculation Function**:
   - Create a helper function to compute the power of a number. Use memoization to avoid recomputation of power values for previously seen numbers.

2. **Generate Range**:
   - Generate the list of integers in the given range `[lo, hi]`.

3. **Sort by Power Values**:
   - Sort the generated list of integers based on their computed power values. Use the original integer values to break ties (though ties are unlikely given the nature of power values).

4. **Return k-th Element**:
   - Extract and return the k-th element from the sorted list.

### Code

```python
def getKth(lo: int, hi: int, k: int) -> int:
    # Memoization dictionary to store already computed power values
    power_map = {}

    # Define the function to compute the power value
    def compute_power_value(x):
        original_x = x
        steps = 0
        while x != 1:
            if x in power_map:
                steps += power_map[x]
                break
            if x % 2 == 0:
                x //= 2
            else:
                x = 3 * x + 1
            steps += 1
        power_map[original_x] = steps
        return steps
    
    # Generate the list of integers in the range [lo, hi]
    nums = list(range(lo, hi + 1))

    # Sort the numbers based on their power value
    nums.sort(key=lambda x: (compute_power_value(x), x))

    # Return the k-th element in the sorted list (1-based indexing)
    return nums[k - 1]

# Example usage:
print(getKth(12, 15, 2))  # Output should be 13
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Power Calculation**: The power calculation for a number `x` takes log(x) steps in the worst case. Memoization helps improve this by caching the results.

2. **Sorting**: Sorting `n` numbers (where `n = hi - lo + 1`) has a time complexity of O(n log n).

Considering both steps, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n * log M)` where `M` is the maximum value in the range (i.e., `hi`), primarily due to the repeated calculation for each integer in the range followed by sorting.
