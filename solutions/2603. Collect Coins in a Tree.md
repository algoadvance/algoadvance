title:  Collect Coins in a Tree-out
permalink: /s2603
---
Given a tree containing `n` nodes and `n - 1` edges, each node has a certain number of coins associated with it. We need to collect coins from all the nodes such that we can move between nodes using the given edges. Each move between nodes from one to another consumes one coin. Calculate the minimum number of moves required to collect all the coins from all the nodes.

**Constraints:**
1. The number of nodes (`n`) in the tree is between `1` and `100,000`.
2. Each node may contain between `0` and `100,000` coins.
3. The tree is connected and acyclic.

### Clarifying Questions
1. If a node has zero coins, do we still need to visit it? 
   - If a node has zero coins, we still need to visit if it's on the path to another node with coins.
2. Can we assume positive costs for all moves between nodes, or is there any special consideration needed for specific edges?
   - Moving between any two connected nodes has a fixed cost of one move.

### Strategy
1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - We have to ensure every node with coins is visited as part of calculating the minimum moves required to collect all coins.
   - The problem can be decomposed as finding the optimal path that visits all nodes with coins.

2. **Traversal Considerations:**
   - We can perform a traversal (like DFS or BFS) starting from any node with coins.
   - We need to ensure that each node on one-to-many paths containing coins is covered in the shortest moves possible.

3. **Algorithm Approach:**
   - We will use BFS to ensure shortest paths are computed and accounted for.
   - Calculate the number of extra moves required by visiting nodes based on subtree information gleaned from BFS or DFS traversals.

### Code

Here's the code to solve the problem:

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

def collectTheCoins(coins, edges):
    n = len(coins)
    if n == 1: 
        return 0
    
    adj = defaultdict(list)
    degree = [0] * n
    for u, v in edges:
        adj[u].append(v)
        adj[v].append(u)
        degree[u] += 1
        degree[v] += 1
    
    # Leaf nodes with zero coins can be ignored
    queue = deque()
    for i in range(n):
        if degree[i] == 1 and coins[i] == 0:
            queue.append(i)
    
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        for neighbor in adj[node]:
            degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if degree[neighbor] == 1 and coins[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    # Collect remaining nodes with coins or those needed in path to them
    queue = deque()
    for i in range(n):
        if degree[i] == 1:
            queue.append(i)
    remaining_nodes = n
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        for neighbor in adj[node]:
            degree[neighbor] -= 1
            remaining_nodes -= 1
            if degree[neighbor] == 1:
                queue.append(neighbor)
    
    return max(0, 2 * (remaining_nodes - 1))

# Example Usage:
coins = [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2]
edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[4,5],[5,6],[6,7]]
print(collectTheCoins(coins, edges))  # Expected output should be the minimized moves

```

### Time Complexity
- Building the adjacency list and degree array: O(n)
- Performing the BFS to prune leaves with zero coins and necessary nodes: O(n)
- Overall, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This ensures our approach is efficient and scalable for the upper constraint limit.
