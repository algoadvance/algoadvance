LeetCode Problem: 1081. Smallest Subsequence of Distinct Characters

Given a string `s`, return the lexicographically smallest subsequence of `s` that contains all the distinct characters of `s` exactly once.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: s = "bcabc"
Output: "abc"

Input: s = "cbacdcbc"
Output: "acdb"
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Duplicates:** Are there any further constraints on how often characters might appear? 
   - No, the given constraints already handle the scenarios involving duplicates.

2. **Case Sensitivity:** Is the string case-sensitive?
   - The problem specifies lowercase English letters, so we can assume that all input will be lowercase.

3. **Order of characters:** Should the characters maintain some specific order?
   - The subsequence should be lexicographically smallest.

## Strategy

We need to ensure that the resulting subsequence:
1. Contains each distinct character exactly once.
2. Is the smallest lexicographically when compared to all other possible subsequences.

### Steps:
1. **Frequency Count:** Use a dictionary to count the frequency of each character.
2. **Stack:** Use a stack to build the result sequence. Maintaining a stack helps to easily compare and remove elements.
3. **Visited Set:** Maintain a set to keep track of characters already in the result to maintain distinct character property.
4. Iterate through the string, performing the following actions:
   - Decrease the frequency of the current character.
   - If the character is already in the `visited` set, continue to the next iteration.
   - If the character is not in the `visited` set, remove characters from the stack (and `visited` set) that are lexicographically greater than the current character and still have remaining occurrences in the input `s`. This ensures that we are attempting to keep the smallest lexicographical order.
   - Add the current character to the stack and mark it as visited.

### Code

```python
def smallestSubsequence(s: str) -> str:
    from collections import Counter
    
    # Step 1: Frequency Count
    char_count = Counter(s)
    
    # Step 2: Initialize Stack and Visited set
    stack = []
    visited = set()
    
    for char in s:
        # Decreasing the count of current character
        char_count[char] -= 1
        
        # If character is already visited, continue
        if char in visited:
            continue
        
        # Maintain lexicographical order by removing greater elements if possible
        while stack and char < stack[-1] and char_count[stack[-1]] > 0:
            removed_char = stack.pop()
            visited.remove(removed_char)
        
        # Add the current character to stack and mark it visited
        stack.append(char)
        visited.add(char)
    
    return ''.join(stack)
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the string `s`. Each character is processed at most twice (once for the main loop and potentially once more if removed and added to `stack` again).
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for `char_count`, `stack`, and `visited`, each holding up to the length of the string.

This solution efficiently computes the lexicographically smallest subsequence while maintaining distinct characters.
