title:  Subarray Sums Divisible by K-out
permalink: /s974
---

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of non-empty subarrays whose sum is divisible by `k`.

A **subarray** is a contiguous part of an array.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [4,5,0,-2,-3,1], k = 5
Output: 7
Explanation: There are 7 subarrays with a sum divisible by k = 5:
[4, 5, 0, -2, -3, 1]
[5]
[5, 0]
[5, 0, -2, -3, 1]
[0]
[0, -2, -3, 1]
[-2, -3]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [5], k = 9
Output: 0
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 30000`
- `-10000 <= nums[i] <= 10000`
- `2 <= k <= 10000`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Should the solution handle negative values for elements in `nums`?
   - Yes, as `nums` can contain negative values.
   
2. Can there be multiple subarrays with the same sum that is divisible by `k`?
   - Yes, and each should be counted.

3. Are there constraints on time complexity for the algorithm?
   - Yes, due to the constraints involving up to 30000 elements, a solution with a time complexity better than O(n^2) is preferable.

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can make use of the prefix sum and a hashmap (dictionary) to keep track of the counts of remainders after dividing the prefix sum by `k`. Here is a step-by-step strategy:

1. Initialize `count` to 0, which will store the number of subarrays whose sum is divisible by `k`.
2. Initialize `prefix_sum` to 0, which will store the cumulative sum of elements.
3. Initialize a dictionary `remainder_count` to keep track of the frequency of each remainder when divided by `k`. Initialize `remainder_count[0]` to 1 to handle the case where the subarray sum itself is divisible by `k` from the beginning.
4. Iterate over the array and for each element:
   - Add the current element to `prefix_sum`.
   - Compute the remainder `remainder` of `prefix_sum % k`.
   - Adjust the remainder to always be positive by adding `k` and then taking `% k`.
   - Add the count of this `remainder` in `remainder_count` to `count` because if the same remainder has been seen before, it implies that the subarray sum between those two indices is divisible by `k`.
   - Increment the count of this remainder in `remainder_count`.

## Code

```python
def subarraysDivByK(nums, k):
    count = 0
    prefix_sum = 0
    remainder_count = {0: 1}
    
    for num in nums:
        prefix_sum += num
        remainder = prefix_sum % k
        if remainder < 0:
            remainder += k
        
        if remainder in remainder_count:
            count += remainder_count[remainder]
            remainder_count[remainder] += 1
        else:
            remainder_count[remainder] = 1
    
    return count
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. This is because we iterate through the array once, and all operations within the loop take constant time. This efficient complexity makes it well-suited for the problem's constraints.
