title:  Smallest Index With Equal Value-out
permalink: /s2057
---

We are given an array of integers `nums`, and we need to find the smallest index `i` such that `i % 10 == nums[i]`. If there is no such index, we should return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the array guaranteed to have positive integers, or can it include negative numbers?**
    - Typically, such problems deal with non-negative indices, so the elements are expected to be non-negative integers.
2. **What should be the value range for numbers in the array?**
    - It's not explicitly given, but it's reasonable to consider typical constraints such as `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^3`.
3. **What should be the length of the array?**
    - Again, while not explicitly stated, typical lengths might be `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`.

Given these typical constraints, we can proceed with our solution.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate through the array `nums`**:
   - For each index `i`, check if `i % 10` is equal to `nums[i]`.
   - As soon as you find such an index, return it.
   - If you finish the iteration without finding such an index, return `-1`.

### Code

```python
def smallest_equal(nums):
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        if i % 10 == nums[i]:
            return i
    return -1
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. This is because we might have to look at each element once in the worst case.

The space complexity is **O(1)** as we are not using any extra space that's dependent on the size of the input array, merely a few variables for iteration.

Let's now run through an example to confirm understanding:

**Example:**

```python
nums = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
smallest_equal(nums)  # This should return 0 because 0 % 10 == 0
```

In this case, the function will return `0` as expected.
