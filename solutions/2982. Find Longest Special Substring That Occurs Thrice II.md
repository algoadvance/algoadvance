title:  Find Longest Special Substring That Occurs Thrice II-out
permalink: /s2982
---
You are given a string `s`. You need to find the longest substring that occurs at least three times in `s`. If there are multiple substrings of the same maximum length that occur at least three times, return any of them. If no such substring exists, return an empty string.

### Clarifying Questions
Before we proceed to the solution, here are some potential clarifications:
1. **Input Size**: What is the maximum length of the input string `s`?
2. **Characters**: What types of characters can the string `s` contain? Is it ASCII or can it include Unicode characters?
3. **Case Sensitivity**: Is the search case-sensitive?
4. **Multiple Results**: If there are multiple correct answers of the same length, can we return any of them?

Assumptions:
1. The input string can be very large, so an efficient algorithm is necessary.
2. The string is composed of lowercase letters.
3. The search is case-sensitive.
4. Any valid substring of the same maximum length can be returned if multiple exist.

### Strategy
To find the longest substring that appears at least three times, we can use the following approach:
1. **Binary Search + Hashing**: Use binary search to determine the maximum length of the substring that appears three times. For each length, use hashing (e.g., Rolling Hash) to count the occurrences of substrings of that length.

#### Steps:
1. **Binary Search**:
   - Set the left and right bounds for binary search (`left`=0, `right`=len(s)).
   - For each midpoint `mid` (length of the substring), use hashing to check if there exists any substring of this length that appears at least three times.
   
2. **Hashing** to Count Substrings:
   - Use a rolling hash to compute hashes for substrings and use a dictionary to count occurrences.

### Code
Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
def longest_substring_with_k_occurrences(s, k):
    def search_for_len(L):
        hash_set = set()
        current_hash = 0
        p = 31
        mod = 2**61 - 1
        p_pow = 1
        
        # Compute hash for the first L-length substring
        for i in range(L):
            current_hash = (current_hash * p + ord(s[i])) % mod
            if i > 0:
                p_pow = (p_pow * p) % mod
        hash_set.add(current_hash)

        # Use rolling hash to compute hash for next substrings of length L
        for i in range(L, len(s)):
            # Remove leading character and add trailing character
            current_hash = (current_hash * p - ord(s[i - L]) * p_pow + ord(s[i])) % mod
            if current_hash in hash_set:
                return True
            hash_set.add(current_hash)
        return False

    left, right = 0, len(s)
    longest_len = 0
    while left < right:
        mid = (left + right + 1) // 2
        if search_for_len(mid):
            longest_len = mid
            left = mid
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    if longest_len == 0:
        return ""
    
    # To find the actual longest substring with at least 3 occurrences.
    def find_longest_substring(L):
        hash_count = {}
        current_hash = 0
        p = 31
        mod = 2**61 - 1
        p_pow = 1
        
        for i in range(L):
            current_hash = (current_hash * p + ord(s[i])) % mod
            if i > 0:
                p_pow = (p_pow * p) % mod
        hash_count[current_hash] = [0]
        
        for i in range(L, len(s)):
            current_hash = (current_hash * p - ord(s[i - L]) * p_pow + ord(s[i])) % mod

            if current_hash in hash_count:
                occurrences = hash_count[current_hash]
                if len(occurrences) == 2:
                    return s[occurrences[0]:occurrences[0] + L]
                hash_count[current_hash].append(i - L + 1)
            else:
                hash_count[current_hash] = [i - L + 1]
        return ""
    
    return find_longest_substring(longest_len)

# Example usage:
s = "ababcababcabc"
print(longest_substring_with_k_occurrences(s, 3))  # "ab"
```

### Time Complexity
- **Binary Search**: O(log N)
- **Hashing each length**: O(N)
Combining these, the overall time complexity is O(N log N), where N is the length of the string `s`.
