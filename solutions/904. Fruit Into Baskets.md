**904. Fruit Into Baskets**

You are visiting a farm that has a single row of fruit trees arranged from left to right. The trees are represented by an array `fruits` where `fruits[i]` is an integer representing the type of fruit the `i-th` tree produces.

You want to collect as much fruit as possible. However, the owner has a rule that you can only collect fruit from at most two different types of trees at any point. Given the array `fruits`, your task is to return the maximum number of fruits you can collect under the given rule.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can the array `fruits` be empty?
   - **A**: No, the array will contain at least one element.

2. **Q**: Can we assume that all integers in the `fruits` array are non-negative?
   - **A**: Yes, all integers in the `fruits` array are non-negative.

3. **Q**: Should the solution handle very large arrays efficiently?
   - **A**: Yes, the solution should be optimized for performance, particularly for large input arrays.

4. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the values of the integers in the `fruits` array?
   - **A**: The integers simply represent different types of fruits and their actual values don't matter beyond this representation.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can utilize the sliding window technique. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step plan:

1. **Sliding Window Technique**: This approach will help us efficiently keep track of the types of fruits and their counts within a dynamic window that moves across the array.
   
2. **Window Management**:
   - Use two pointers `start` and `end` to represent the current window.
   - Use a dictionary to keep track of the count of each type of fruit within the window.
   - Expand the window by moving the `end` pointer and add the fruit at `fruits[end]` to the dictionary.
   - If the dictionary contains more than two types of fruits, shrink the window from the `start` side until we are back to having at most two types of fruits.

3. **Update the Maximum Count**: Keep track of the maximum number of fruits collected as we expand and shrink the window.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the `fruits` array. Each fruit is added and removed from the dictionary at most once.

### Code

```python
def totalFruit(fruits):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    start, max_fruits = 0, 0
    fruit_count = defaultdict(int)
    
    # Iterate over the end pointer
    for end in range(len(fruits)):
        fruit_count[fruits[end]] += 1
        
        # If we have more than 2 types of fruits, shrink the window from the start
        while len(fruit_count) > 2:
            fruit_count[fruits[start]] -= 1
            if fruit_count[fruits[start]] == 0:
                del fruit_count[fruits[start]]
            start += 1
        
        # Update the maximum number of fruits we have seen so far
        max_fruits = max(max_fruits, end - start + 1)
    
    return max_fruits

# Example Usage:
fruits = [1, 2, 1]
print(totalFruit(fruits))  # Output: 3
```

In this implementation:
- We use a dictionary `fruit_count` to keep track of the count of each type of fruit within the sliding window.
- The `start` pointer helps in shrinking the window when there are more than two types of fruits.
- We update the `max_fruits` to keep track of the largest window size that contains at most two types of fruits.
