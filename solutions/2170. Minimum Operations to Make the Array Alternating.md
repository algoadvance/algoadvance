title:  Minimum Operations to Make the Array Alternating-out
permalink: /s2170
---

You are given a 0-indexed array `nums` consisting of `n` positive integers.

The array `nums` is called alternating if:

- `nums[i - 1] != nums[i]` for all `i` from `1` to `n - 1` (0-indexed).

In one operation, you can choose any index `i` and change `nums[i]` to any positive integer.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make the array alternating.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the array guaranteed to have at least two elements?**
   - Typically, yes. It's implied that we need to make the array alternating, which wouldnâ€™t make sense for less than 2 elements.
   
2. **Can the integers be extremely large?**
   - The integers being large is not typically a concern for the logic of the solution.

3. **Is changing an element to itself considered an operation?**
   - No, a change only counts when a value is altered, but we need to count the number of changes needed.

### Strategy

1. **Group elements based on even and odd indices:**
    - Separate the values at even indices and odd indices.
  
2. **Find the most common element in both groups:**
    - Use a counter to determine the frequency of each number in the even-indexed and odd-indexed groups.

3. **Determine the optimal replacements:**
    - Consider a few cases:
      - The most common element in even-indexed positions should be different from the most common element in odd-indexed positions.
      - If the most common elements in both even and odd positions are the same, consider the second most common elements for replacement.

4. **Calculate the minimum number of operations needed:**
    - Sum up the minimum operations required based on the frequency counts.

### Code

```python
from collections import Counter

def minimumOperations(nums):
    if len(nums) == 1:
        return 0

    even_indices = nums[0::2]
    odd_indices = nums[1::2]

    even_counts = Counter(even_indices)
    odd_counts = Counter(odd_indices)
    
    if len(even_counts) == 0 or len(odd_counts) == 0:
        return 0  # trivial case, already alternating

    most_common_even, count_even = even_counts.most_common(1)[0]
    most_common_odd, count_odd = odd_counts.most_common(1)[0]
    
    if most_common_even != most_common_odd:
        return len(nums) - count_even - count_odd
    
    # Check the other possibilities
    second_most_common_even = next(((num, count) for num, count in even_counts.most_common() if num != most_common_even), (None, 0))
    second_most_common_odd = next(((num, count) for num, count in odd_counts.most_common() if num != most_common_odd), (None, 0))
    
    return min(len(nums) - count_even - second_most_common_odd[1], 
               len(nums) - count_odd - second_most_common_even[1])

# Example usage:
# nums = [3, 1, 3, 2, 4, 3]
# print(minimumOperations(nums))  # Expected output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **Building Counters:** O(n) where n is the length of the input array.
- **Finding Most Common Elements:** O(k log k) where k is the number of unique elements (typically much smaller than n).

Overall, the solution runs in O(n), making it efficient for large arrays.
