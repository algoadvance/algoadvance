title:  Number of Good Leaf Nodes Pairs-out
permalink: /s1530

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer distance, return the number of good leaf node pairs in the tree.

A "good leaf node pair" is defined as a pair of leaf nodes (Leaf1, Leaf2) such that the shortest path between them in the tree is less than or equal to the given distance.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What constitutes a leaf node?**
   - A leaf node is a node with no children.
   
2. **What are the constraints on the tree and the distance value?**
   - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 2000]`.
   - `1 <= Distance <= 10`.

3. **Can the distance between two leaf nodes be interpreted as the number of edges between them?**
   - Yes, the distance should be counted in terms of edges.

4. **What kind of data structure will represent the binary tree?**
   - The tree will be represented using the standard TreeNode class.

### Strategy
The approach involves the following steps:
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Traverse the tree using DFS to identify all leaf nodes and compute the distances between them.
2. **Distance Calculation:** Use a post-order traversal (left, right, root) to compute the distance between all pairs of leaf nodes.
3. **Count Pairs:** Maintain a count of distances between leaf nodes at each recursion step and count how many pairs of leaf nodes have the required distance.

### Code
Here's a Python implementation of the described strategy:

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def countPairs(root: TreeNode, distance: int) -> int:
    def dfs(node):
        if not node:
            return []
        if not node.left and not node.right:
            return [1]  # return the distance 1 for leaf node
        
        left_counts = dfs(node.left)
        right_counts = dfs(node.right)
        
        for l in left_counts:
            for r in right_counts:
                if l + r <= distance:
                    nonlocal good_pairs
                    good_pairs += 1
        
        # Increment all distances by 1 to account for the current node
        return [d + 1 for d in left_counts + right_counts]
    
    good_pairs = 0
    dfs(root)
    return good_pairs
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(N^2)\) in the worst case, where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This comes from the nested loops combining lists of distances from left and right subtrees.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(N)\) for the recursive stack and the list of distances maintained for each node.

This code ensures that we efficiently count the number of good leaf node pairs using a depth-first traversal, processing each node just once.
