title:  Number of Visible People in a Queue-out
permalink: /s1944
---

You are given an array of unique integers `heights` representing the heights of people standing in a queue. Each person in the queue can see the person directly in front of them until a person taller than themselves blocks their view.

The problem requires you to return an array `result` where `result[i]` is the number of people the person at position `i` can see in front of them.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Direction of the Queue:**
    - Do people see towards the left or the right in the array? (Assuming towards the right as this is common in such problems.)

2. **Output Requirement:**
    - Should the result be returned as a list of integers where each index `i` denotes the count of people visible to the person at index `i`?

3. **Constraints:**
    - Can we assume a maximum length for the array `heights`?
    - Is performance critical for large inputs?

### Strategy

1. **Data Structures:**
    - Utilize a stack to efficiently manage and traverse the heights, accounting for visibility in one pass.

2. **Algorithm Approach:**
    - We will iterate over the heights array from right to left.
    - Use a stack to keep track of indices of the people in a way that helps count visible people from each position.
    - For each person, pop from the stack until a person taller is found, keeping count of the visible people.
    - Push the current height index onto the stack after processing.

3. **Steps in Detail:**
    - Initialize a result array of the same length as `heights` with all elements set to 0.
    - Traverse the `heights` array from the end to the beginning.
    - Initialize an empty stack.
    - For each person, keep popping from the stack (incrementing a visibility count) until a taller person is found.
    - Update `result[i]` with the count of people seen.
    - Push the current index onto the stack.
    
### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of the heights array, since each index is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for the stack and the result array.

### Code

```python
def canSeePersonsCount(heights):
    n = len(heights)
    result = [0] * n  # Initialize result array
    stack = []  # Stack to keep track of indices
    
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        count = 0
        # Check how many people the current person can see
        while stack and heights[i] > heights[stack[-1]]:
            stack.pop()
            count += 1
        if stack:
            count += 1  # Can see the next taller person as well
        result[i] = count
        stack.append(i)  # Push current person's index onto the stack
    
    return result

# Example usage
heights = [10, 6, 8, 5, 11, 9]
print(canSeePersonsCount(heights))
# Output: [3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0]
```

This solution processes each height in the input array once and utilizes a stack to keep track of visible persons, ensuring an efficient overall performance.
