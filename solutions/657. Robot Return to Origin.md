title:  Robot Return to Origin-out
permalink: /s657
---

You are given a string `moves` that represents the movements of a robot on a 2D plane. The robot starts at the origin point (0, 0), and each character in the string moves it as follows:
- 'U' moves the robot up (y + 1),
- 'D' moves the robot down (y - 1),
- 'L' moves the robot left (x - 1),
- 'R' moves the robot right (x + 1).

Return `True` if the robot returns to the origin after completing all of its moves, or `False` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the string length?**
   - The length of `moves` will be between 1 and 10^4.

2. **Will the string only contain the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'?**
   - Yes, the string will only consist of the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', and 'R'.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize a starting position**: Use variables `x` and `y` to track the robot's position, starting both at 0.
2. **Iterate through the string**: For each move in the string, update the `x` and `y` coordinates according to the move.
3. **Check the final position**: After processing all moves, check if the robot's position is back at the origin (0, 0).
4. **Return the result**: If the position is (0, 0), return `True`; otherwise, return `False`.

### Code

```python
def judgeCircle(moves: str) -> bool:
    x, y = 0, 0
    
    for move in moves:
        if move == 'U':
            y += 1
        elif move == 'D':
            y -= 1
        elif move == 'L':
            x -= 1
        elif move == 'R':
            x += 1
    
    return x == 0 and y == 0
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string `moves`. This is because we iterate over the string once, and each operation inside the loop is constant time.
