title:  Number of Valid Words for Each Puzzle-out
permalink: /s1178
---

You are given a list of strings `words` and a list of strings `puzzles`.

For each puzzle, you need to find the number of valid words. A word is valid for a puzzle if both of the following conditions are true:
1. Word contains the first letter of the puzzle.
2. For each letter in the word, that letter is in the puzzle.

Return an array where the ith element is the number of valid words for the ith puzzle.

Example:
```
Input: words = ["aaaa","asas","able","ability","actt","actor","access"], puzzles = ["aboveyz","abrodyz","abslute","absoryz","actresz","gaswxyz"]
Output: [1,1,3,2,4,0]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are all inputs strictly lowercase English letters?
   - Yes, both words and puzzles are only composed of lowercase English letters.
2. Could there be any duplicate words or puzzles in the input list?
   - There might be duplicates, but we should treat each occurrence individually.
3. Are `words` and `puzzles` of reasonable length for a brute force approach?
   - The constraints suggest that a more optimized approach than brute force would be necessary, typically `1 <= words.length <= 10^5` and `1 <= puzzles.length <= 10^4`.

## Strategy

### Approach
1. **Bitmask Representation:** Use bitmasks to represent words and puzzles efficiently:
    - Each word and puzzle can be represented using a bitmask where each bit in the bitmask corresponds to a letter ('a' = 0th bit, 'b' = 1st bit, â€¦, 'z' = 25th bit).
2. **Pre-computation:** 
    - Compute the bitmask for each word.
    - For each puzzle, generate all possible subsets that include its first letter. This is important because any valid word needs to contain this first letter.
3. **Subset Generation:** 
   - For a given bitmask representing a puzzle, generate all subsets of the puzzle bitmask and count how many words match each subset using a dictionary lookup.

### Pseudocode
1. Generate bitmask for each word.
2. Iterate over each puzzle.
3. For each puzzle, generate its bitmask and the bitmasks of all its subsets containing its first letter.
4. Count the words match each subset bitmask using a dictionary that pre-computes the count of each word bitmask.

## Implementation

```python
def findNumOfValidWords(words, puzzles):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    def bitmask(word):
        mask = 0
        for char in word:
            mask |= (1 << (ord(char) - ord('a')))
        return mask
    
    word_count = defaultdict(int)
    
    # Compute bitmask for each word and count frequencies
    for word in words:
        mask = bitmask(word)
        word_count[mask] += 1
    
    results = []
    
    for puzzle in puzzles:
        puzzle_mask = bitmask(puzzle)
        first_letter_mask = 1 << (ord(puzzle[0]) - ord('a'))
        
        # Generate subsets of puzzle including the first letter
        count = 0
        subset = puzzle_mask
        while subset:
            if subset & first_letter_mask:
                count += word_count[subset]
            subset = (subset - 1) & puzzle_mask
        
        # Don't forget to check the empty subset (when subset becomes 0)
        if first_letter_mask & puzzle_mask:
            count += word_count[first_letter_mask]
        
        results.append(count)
    
    return results

# Example Usage
words = ["aaaa","asas","able","ability","actt","actor","access"]
puzzles = ["aboveyz","abrodyz","abslute","absoryz","actresz","gaswxyz"]
print(findNumOfValidWords(words, puzzles))  # Output: [1, 1, 3, 2, 4, 0]
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Bitmask Calculation:**
   - Words: O(W) where W is the total number of characters across all words.
   - Puzzles: O(P) where P is the total number of characters across all puzzles.
   
2. **Subset Generation:**
   - For each puzzle, the number of subsets is 2^6 (6 letters max) = 64.

Thus, the total time complexity is `O(W + P * 2^6)` which is approximately `O(W + 64P)` and can be handled within the given constraint limits.
