title:  Find the Sum of Subsequence Powers-out
permalink: /s3098
---

You are given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order. A subsequence of `nums` is a sequence that can be derived from the array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. 

Find the sum of the power of each subsequence. The power of a subsequence is defined as the product of the first and last element of the subsequence. 

Return the sum of the power of all non-empty subsequences of `nums`. 

Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Example
```
Input: nums = [2, 3, 5]
Output: 48
Explanation: The subsequences are:
[2] -> 2*2 = 4
[3] -> 3*3 = 9
[5] -> 5*5 = 25
[2,3] -> 2*3 = 6
[2,5] -> 2*5 = 10
[3,5] -> 3*5 = 15
[2,3,5] -> 2*5 = 10
Sum is 4+9+25+6+10+15+10 = 79
79 % (10^9 + 7) = 79.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. What is the length range of the `nums` array? (Helps determine efficiency concerns)
2. Can `nums` contain duplicate elements?
3. Confirm that `nums` will always be sorted in non-decreasing order.

Assumptions: `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order, contains no duplicates, and has a reasonable length for computational feasibility.

## Strategy

### Approach
1. **Subsequences Identification**: For each element in `nums`, treat it as the start of a subsequence and find all valid ends for subsequences starting at that index.
2. **Efficient Calculation**: 
    - Use combinatorics to calculate how many subsequences start with `nums[i]` and end with `nums[j]`.
    - Determine contributions directly using combinatorial coefficients.
3. **Mathematical Insight**:
    - For every pair `(i, j)` where `i <= j`, the subsequence starts with `nums[i]` and ends with `nums[j]`.
    - Number of subsequences involving both `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` (including elements between) is `2^(j - i - 1)`.

### Key Observations
- Given `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`, their involvement in subsequences depends on the number of ways to include elements between them.
- Mathematical summation helps in direct calculation.

### Implementation Considerations
1. **Modulo Operations**: Always return results modulo `10^9 + 7`.
2. **Efficient Power Calculations**: Use pre-computed powers of 2 for efficiency.

## Time Complexity
Analyzing combination and subsequence logic for an array of length `n` suggests the solution could be within `O(n^2)` in the worst-case scenario, but with some optimizations.

## Code

```python
def sum_of_subsequence_powers(nums):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    n = len(nums)
    
    # Precompute powers of 2 up to n
    pow2 = [1] * (n+1)
    for i in range(1, n+1):
        pow2[i] = (pow2[i-1] * 2) % MOD
    
    result = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            contributions = (nums[i] * nums[j]) % MOD
            contributions *= pow2[j-i]
            contributions %= MOD
            result += contributions
            result %= MOD
    
    return result

# Example usage
nums = [2, 3, 5]
print(sum_of_subsequence_powers(nums))  # Output should be 79
```

## Conclusion
- This solution precomputes power values and utilizes nested loops to calculate contributions for subsequences, ensuring modular constraints.
- It efficiently handles the overall subsequence power sum problem within feasible time and space limits.
