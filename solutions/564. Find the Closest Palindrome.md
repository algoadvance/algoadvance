title:  Find the Closest Palindrome-out
permalink: /s564
---

Given a positive integer `n` represented as a string, return the closest integer (not including itself), which is a palindrome. If there is a tie, return the smaller one.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**
    - How large can the integer `n` be? 
    - Is `n` always positive?
    - What is the minimal length of `n`?

2. **Output Constraints**
    - In cases of ties, should the output always favor the smaller number?
    
3. **Test Cases**
    - Are there specific edge cases we should consider, such as very small or very large numbers?

4. **Return Type**
    - Should the output be in the form of a string or integer?

Let's move forward with an assumed understanding since we're dealing with a typical leetcode problem.

### Code

```python
def nearestPalindromic(n: str) -> str:
    length = len(n)
    candidates = set()

    # Various strategies to generate candidate palindromes

    # Handle edge cases explicitly
    if n == "1":
        return "0"
    
    if n == "0":
        return "1"
    
    # Adding two special edge size candidates: One more digit and one fewer digit versions
    candidates.add(str(10**length + 1))
    candidates.add(str(10**(length-1) - 1))
    
    # Take only the first half of the string and process
    prefix = int(n[:(length + 1) // 2])
    for i in [-1, 0, 1]: # Generate three possibilities
        p = str(prefix + i)
        if length % 2 == 0:
            candidate = p + p[::-1]
        else:
            candidate = p + p[-2::-1]
        candidates.add(candidate)
    
    # Remove n itself from candidates
    candidates.discard(n)
    
    # Calculate the closest by absolute numeric difference
    closest = None
    n_num = int(n)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    
    for candidate in candidates:
        candidate_num = int(candidate)
        diff = abs(candidate_num - n_num)
        
        if (diff < min_diff) or (diff == min_diff and candidate_num < int(closest)):
            min_diff = diff
            closest = candidate
    
    return closest

# Example usage
print(nearestPalindromic("123"))  # Expected output: "121"
```

### Strategy

1. **Edge Cases Handling**: Consider important edge cases such as very small numbers, e.g., "0" and "1".

2. **Candidate Generation**:
    - Generate candidates by adding and subtracting 1 from the central prefix of the number.
    - Consider edge palindromes for numbers with different lengths: `10**length + 1` and `10**(length-1) - 1`.

3. **Prefix Calculation**:
    - The central segment of the number's first half is adjusted by -1, 0, and +1 to generate potential palindromes.

4. **Choosing the Closest Palindrome**:
    - Convert the string candidates to integers.
    - Compute the absolute difference from the original number `n`.
    - Track the minimum difference and prefer smaller values in case of ties.

### Time Complexity

- **Palindrome Generation**: O(1) fixed number of operations (adjusting prefix).
- **Closest Palindrome Calculation**: O(k), minimal where k is the fixed number of candidates.

Overall, the implementation runs in constant time O(1) relative to complexity of palindrome candidacy, making it very efficient irrespective of number size.
