title:  Length of the Longest Alphabetical Continuous Substring-out
permalink: /s2414
---

Given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, return the length of the longest alphabetical continuous substring. An alphabetical continuous substring is a substring that consists of letters in alphabetical order (i.e., 'abcdef' or 'xyz').

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the minimum and maximum length of the string `s`?**
   - The constraints typically range from 1 to 10^5 for such problems.
2. **Are there any specific characters or just lowercase English letters?**
   - The problem statement mentions only lowercase English letters.
3. **Can the string be empty?**
   - The problem statement does not specify explicitly, but we'll assume it won't be empty based on typical LeetCode problem constraints.

### Strategy

1. Initialize variables to keep track of the current length of a continuous alphabetical substring and the maximum length found.
2. Traverse the string from the beginning to the end.
3. For each character in the string, check if it continues the alphabetical order from the previous character.
4. If it does, increment the current length counter.
5. If it does not, compare and possibly update the maximum length, then reset the current length counter.
6. After finishing the traversal, a final comparison should be made to ensure the last segment is considered.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the above strategy in Python:

```python
def longest_continuous_substring(s: str) -> int:
    if not s:
        return 0
    
    max_length = 1  # A single character is a valid substring
    current_length = 1
    
    for i in range(1, s.length()):
        if ord(s[i]) == ord(s[i-1]) + 1:
            current_length += 1
            max_length = max(max_length, current_length)
        else:
            current_length = 1
    
    return max_length
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string. We are iterating through the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
