title:  Check Array Formation Through Concatenation-out
permalink: /s1640
---
You are given an array of distinct integers `arr` and an array of integer arrays `pieces`, where the integers in `pieces` are distinct. Your goal is to form the array `arr` by concatenating the arrays in `pieces` in any order. However, you cannot reorder the integers in each subarray in `pieces`.

Return `True` if you can form the array `arr` by concatenating the arrays in `pieces`. Otherwise, return `False`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the integers in `arr` and each subarray of `pieces` unique?**
   - Yes, all integers in `arr` and `pieces` are distinct.
   
2. **Can the `pieces` be used only once?**
   - Yes, each subarray in `pieces` can only be used once.

3. **What are the constraints on the lengths of `arr` and `pieces`?**
   - The length of `arr` is in the range `[1, 100]`.
   - The length of each subarray in `pieces` is in the range `[1, 100]`.

With these clarifications in mind, let's plan our solution.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we will follow these steps:
1. Create a dictionary that maps the first element of each subarray in `pieces` to the subarray itself.
2. Iterate through `arr` while trying to match each segment of `arr` with one of the subarrays in `pieces` as denoted by the dictionary.
3. If at any point there is no matching subarray or if a piece of the array doesn't conform to any subarray, return `False`.
4. If we successfully iterate through the entire `arr`, return `True`.

### Code

```python
def can_form_array(arr, pieces):
    # Create a dictionary with the first element of each subarray in pieces as the key
    piece_dict = {piece[0]: piece for piece in pieces}
    
    i = 0
    while i < len(arr):
        if arr[i] not in piece_dict:
            return False
        
        piece = piece_dict[arr[i]]
        # Check if the piece matches the segment of arr starting at index i
        if arr[i:i+len(piece)] != piece:
            return False
        
        i += len(piece)
    
    return True

# Example Usage
arr = [85, 1, 2, 3, 101]
pieces = [[85], [1, 2, 3], [101]]
print(can_form_array(arr, pieces))  # Expected Output: True
```

### Time Complexity
- Constructing the dictionary takes \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the number of subarrays in `pieces`.
- Iterating through `arr` and checking segments takes \(O(m)\) where \(m\) is the length of `arr`.

Thus, the final time complexity of the solution is \(O(m + n)\) which is efficient given the problem constraints.
