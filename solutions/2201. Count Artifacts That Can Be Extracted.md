title:  Count Artifacts That Can Be Extracted-out
permalink: /s2201
---

You are given a 2D grid `n x n` representing the positions of artifacts and a 2D grid `dig` where each entry represents a cell that has been dug out. You need to determine how many artifacts can be fully extracted given the positions that have been excavated (dug out).

An artifact is fully extracted if and only if every cell of the artifact is dug out.

An artifact can be of any shape, but it occupies a contiguous section of the grid.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size of the grid?** 
   - The grid size is `n x n`.

2. **How are artifacts represented?**
   - Artifacts are represented by a 2D list `artifacts` where each artifact is given by coordinates `[r1, c1, r2, c2]` representing the top-left and bottom-right corners.

3. **How are the dig positions represented?**
   - The dig positions are represented by a 2D list `dig` where each entry is a coordinate `[r, c]`.

4. **What should be returned?**
   - Return the number of fully extracted artifacts.

## Strategy

The strategy to solve the problem consists of the following steps:
1. **Represent Dug Cells**: Create a set to represent the cells that have been dug.
2. **Check Each Artifact**: For each artifact, determine if all the cells it covers have been dug.
3. **Count Fully Extracted Artifacts**: Maintain a count of artifacts that can be fully extracted based on the cells.

## Code

```python
def count_artifacts(n, artifacts, dig):
    # Step 1: Create a set of dug cells
    dug_set = set((r, c) for r, c in dig)
    
    # Step 2: Function to check if an artifact can be fully extracted
    def is_artifact_fully_extracted(r1, c1, r2, c2):
        for r in range(r1, r2 + 1):
            for c in range(c1, c2 + 1):
                if (r, c) not in dug_set:
                    return False
        return True
    
    fully_extracted_count = 0
    
    # Step 3: Check each artifact
    for r1, c1, r2, c2 in artifacts:
        if is_artifact_fully_extracted(r1, c1, r2, c2):
            fully_extracted_count += 1
            
    return fully_extracted_count

# Example usage:
n = 5
artifacts = [[1, 1, 2, 2], [3, 0, 3, 1]]
dig = [[1, 1], [2, 1], [1, 2], [2, 2], [3, 0]]
print(count_artifacts(n, artifacts, dig))  # Output should be 1
```

## Time Complexity

- **Creating the `dug_set`**: O(m), where m is the number of entries in `dig`.
- **Checking artifacts**:
  - There are `k` artifacts.
  - For each artifact, we may potentially check up to `n^2` cells in the worst case.
  - Total time complexity for this step: O(k * n^2).

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(k * n^2 + m). Here, the dominating term depends on the relative sizes of `k` (number of artifacts) and `m` (number of dig positions).
