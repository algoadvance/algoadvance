title:  Prime Number of Set Bits in Binary Representation-out
permalink: /s762
---

The problem is stated as follows:

Given two integers `left` and `right`, return the count of numbers in the range `[left, right]` (inclusive) having a prime number of set bits in their binary representation.

- A number has set bits that are '1' in its binary representation.
- A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range Constraints**: What are the lower and upper bounds of the range `[left, right]`?
    - Typical constraint ranges are \(1 \leq \text{left} \leq \text{right} \leq 10^6\).

2. **Number of Set Bits**: Is there a specific range for the number of bits counted for the prime determination?
    - Considering a maximum range, itâ€™s up to 20 bits since \(2^{19} \approx 10^6\).

3. **Prime Number Definition**: Only prime numbers greater than 1 should be considered?
    - Yes, standard prime definition applies. Prime numbers include 2, 3, 5, 7, etc.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, follow these steps:

1. **Convert Number to Binary**: Use Pythonâ€™s built-in binary conversion to count set bits.
2. **Prime Check**: Create a helper function to determine if a number is prime.
3. **Iterate through Range**: For each number in the range `[left, right]`, count the set bits and check if that count is prime.
4. **Count Valid Numbers**: Maintain a counter for numbers with a prime number of set bits.
5. **Optimization**: Use memoization or a precomputed set of known prime numbers up to a reasonable size to optimize the prime check.

### Code

```python
def countPrimeSetBits(left: int, right: int) -> int:
    def is_prime(num):
        if num <= 1:
            return False
        if num <= 3:
            return True
        if num % 2 == 0 or num % 3 == 0:
            return False
        i = 5
        while (i * i) <= num:
            if num % i == 0 or num % (i + 2) == 0:
                return False
            i += 6
        return True

    # Precompute the set of all primes up to 19
    prime_set = {i for i in range(2, 20) if is_prime(i)}

    result = 0

    for num in range(left, right + 1):
        set_bits = bin(num).count('1')
        if set_bits in prime_set:
            result += 1

    return result
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Prime Check**: The `is_prime` function runs in \(O(\sqrt{p})\) time.
2. **Binary Conversion and Count**: The `bin(num).count('1')` runs in \(O(\log n)\) where \(n\) is the number being converted.
3. **Iteration Over Range**: We iterate through each number in the range `[left, right]`, which runs \(O(n)\) where \(n = \text{right} - \text{left} + 1\).

Overall time complexity is approximately \(O(n \cdot \log n + \sqrt{p})\) where \(n\) is the range size and \(p\) the largest number of set bits we need to check for primality.

### Example

```python
print(countPrimeSetBits(6, 10))  # Output: 4
```

This counts numbers 6 to 10 and checks the set bits:
- 6 (110): 2 set bits (prime)
- 7 (111): 3 set bits (prime)
- 8 (1000): 1 set bit (not prime)
- 9 (1001): 2 set bits (prime)
- 10 (1010): 2 set bits (prime)

Hence, we get 4 numbers with a prime number of set bits.
