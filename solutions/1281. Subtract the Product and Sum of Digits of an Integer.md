title:  Subtract the Product and Sum of Digits of an Integer-out
permalink: /s1281
---
Given an integer number `n`, return the difference between the product of its digits and the sum of its digits.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Range**: Are there any constraints on the input number `n` (e.g., the range of `n`)?
   - Generally, we assume `n` to be a non-negative integer within the typical integer range.
   
2. **Edge Cases**: How should we handle cases such as `0` or single-digit numbers?
   - For `0`, the product and sum will both be `0`, so the result should be `0`.
   - For single-digit values, the product and sum will be the same, resulting in a difference of `0`.

No additional clarifications seem necessary. Let's proceed with the solution.

### Strategy:
1. **Extract Digits**: Convert the integer `n` to a string to easily iterate through each digit.
2. **Initialize Variables**: Initialize two variables to compute the product and sum of the digits.
3. **Compute Product and Sum**: Traverse each digit, converting it back to an integer, and update the product and sum accordingly.
4. **Calculate Difference**: Compute the difference between the product and the sum.
5. **Return Result**: Return the computed difference.

### Code:
```python
def subtractProductAndSum(n: int) -> int:
    digits = [int(digit) for digit in str(n)]  # Convert number to list of digits
    product = 1
    total_sum = 0
    
    for digit in digits:
        product *= digit
        total_sum += digit
    
    return product - total_sum

# Example usage
print(subtractProductAndSum(234))  # Output: 15 (2*3*4 - (2+3+4) = 24 - 9 = 15)
print(subtractProductAndSum(4421))  # Output: 21 (4*4*2*1 - (4+4+2+1) = 32 - 11 = 21)
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(d)**, where `d` is the number of digits in the integer `n`. This is because we iterate over each digit exactly once.
- Conversion of `n` to a string and list comprehension both operate in O(d) time.

This completes the solution, ensuring efficiency and correctness based on the problem constraints and requirements.
