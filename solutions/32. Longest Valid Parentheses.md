title:  Longest Valid Parentheses-out
permalink: /s32
---

Given a string containing just the characters '(' and ')', return the length of the longest valid (well-formed) parentheses substring.

### Examples

1. Input: s = "(()"
   Output: 2
   Explanation: The longest valid parentheses substring is "()".

2. Input: s = ")()())"
   Output: 4
   Explanation: The longest valid parentheses substring is "()()".

3. Input: s = ""
   Output: 0

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the input string's length?**
   - Typical constraint is `0 <= s.length <= 3 * 10^4`.

2. **Should we consider single valid parenthesis as a valid substring?**
   - No, a single parenthesis is not valid. Only pairs `()` are considered valid.

3. **Are there any specific characters other than `(` and `)` in the input string?**
   - As per the problem statement, the string only contains `(` and `)`.

With these points clarified, let's discuss the strategy.

## Strategy

We will explore using a stack to keep track of indices where potential valid substrings can start or end. Here’s the detailed approach:

1. Initialize a stack with `-1` to handle edge cases where a valid substring starts from the beginning.
2. Traverse each character in the string along with its index.
   - When encountering `(`, push the index onto the stack.
   - When encountering `)`, pop from the stack:
     - If the stack becomes empty, push the current index onto the stack.
     - If the stack is not empty, calculate the length of the current valid substring using the current index and the index at the top of the stack.

This way, the stack helps maintain the indices of unbalanced parentheses and helps calculate lengths of valid substrings efficiently.

## Code

Here’s the implementation in Python:

```python
def longestValidParentheses(s: str) -> int:
    stack = [-1]
    max_len = 0

    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        if char == '(':
            stack.append(i)
        else:
            stack.pop()
            if not stack:
                stack.append(i)
            else:
                max_len = max(max_len, i - stack[-1])
    
    return max_len

# Examples for testing the function
print(longestValidParentheses("(()"))       # Output: 2
print(longestValidParentheses(")()())"))   # Output: 4
print(longestValidParentheses(""))         # Output: 0
print(longestValidParentheses("()(())"))   # Output: 6
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string. We only traverse the string once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case if all characters are `(`. The stack could hold all indices.

This strategy ensures that we efficiently calculate the longest valid parentheses substring with optimal time and space usage.
