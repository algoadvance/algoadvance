title:  Wiggle Subsequence-out
permalink: /s376
---

A **wiggle sequence** is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. The first difference (if one exists) might be either positive or negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.

- For example, `[1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5]` is a wiggle sequence because the differences `(6, -3, 5, -7, 3)` are alternately positive and negative.
- In contrast, `[1, 4, 7, 2, 5]` and `[1, 7, 4, 5, 5]` are not wiggle sequences. The first is not because its first two differences are positive, and the second is not because its last difference is zero.

Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest wiggle subsequence.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What if the input `nums` is empty?**
   - Return 0.

2. **What if the input `nums` contains only one element?**
   - Return 1 since a single element is trivially a wiggle sequence.

3. **How large can the input array `nums` be?**
   - The input array can have up to \(10^4\) elements.

4. **Are all values in `nums` unique?**
   - No guarantee that all values are unique.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach:
1. Iterate through the array while keeping track of the previous difference (`prevDiff`) between consecutive elements.
2. Update the count of the wiggle sequence every time we find a valid "wiggle" (i.e., a change in the direction of the difference).
3. The count starts at 1 due to the first element of the array being part of the sequence by default.

### Code

```python
def wiggleMaxLength(nums):
    if len(nums) < 2:
        return len(nums)
    
    prevDiff = nums[1] - nums[0]
    count = 1 if prevDiff == 0 else 2

    for i in range(2, len(nums)):
        diff = nums[i] - nums[i - 1]
        if (diff > 0 and prevDiff <= 0) or (diff < 0 and prevDiff >= 0):
            count += 1
            prevDiff = diff
    
    return count
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of `nums`. The algorithm iterates through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), as we only use a few additional variables to store the differences and the count. No extra space proportional to the input size is used.
