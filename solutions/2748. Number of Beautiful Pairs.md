title:  Number of Beautiful Pairs-out
permalink: /s2748
---

Given an array of positive integers `nums`, return the number of **beautiful pairs** in the array. A beautiful pair is defined as follows:

- A pair of indices `(i, j)` (where `i < j`) such that the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the first digit of `nums[i]` and the last digit of `nums[j]` is `1`.

**Example:**
- Input: `nums = [12, 34, 56, 78]`
- Output: `3`
  
In the example above, the beautiful pairs are `(0, 1)`, `(0, 2)`, and `(0, 3)` because the GCD of the first digit of `nums[0]`, `nums[1]`, and `nums[2]` with the last digit of `nums[1]`, `nums[2]`, and `nums[3]` respectively all equal `1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can `nums` contain only one element?
   **A:** No, `nums` should contain at least two elements for pairs to exist.

2. **Q:** Are the numbers in `nums` guaranteed to be positive integers?
   **A:** Yes, the numbers in `nums` are positive integers.
   
3. **Q:** What is the range of the numbers in `nums`?
   **A:** The problem does not specify, but we can assume they fit within the typical constraints of an integer in competitive programming settings (e.g., 32-bit integers).

## Strategy

1. **Extract Digits:**
   - Compute the first digit of `nums[i]` by repeatedly dividing by 10 until the number is a single digit.
   - Compute the last digit of `nums[j]` using the modulus operation (`nums[j] % 10`).

2. **Check Pairing Condition:**
   - For each combination of indices `(i, j)` where `i < j`, check if the GCD of the first digit of `nums[i]` and the last digit of `nums[j]` equals 1.

3. **Count Pairs:**
   - Maintain a count of how many such pairs exist that satisfy the above condition.

4. **Efficiency Consideration:**
   - Since the calculation involves pairs, the complexity is `O(n^2)` in the worst case (where `n` is the length of `nums`). This might be acceptable for reasonably small values of `n`.

## Code

```python
import math

def countBeautifulPairs(nums):
    def get_first_digit(n):
        while n >= 10:
            n //= 10
        return n
    
    count = 0
    n = len(nums)
    
    for i in range(n):
        first_digit = get_first_digit(nums[i])
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            last_digit = nums[j] % 10
            if math.gcd(first_digit, last_digit) == 1:
                count += 1
                
    return count

# Example usage:
nums = [12, 34, 56, 78]
print(countBeautifulPairs(nums))  # Output should be 3
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n^2)`
  - We are iterating through all pairs `(i, j)` with `i < j`, hence the nested loop results in `O(n^2)`.
  - Computation of the first and last digits and GCD are considered `O(log10(num))` which is insignificant compared to `O(n^2)` complexity of the nested iteration.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
  - We are using a constant amount of additional space regardless of the input size.

This code ensures that we accurately count all beautiful pairs in the given list `nums` according to the specified criteria.
