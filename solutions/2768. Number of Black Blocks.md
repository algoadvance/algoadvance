title:  Number of Black Blocks-out
permalink: /s2768

You are given a grid of size `m x n`, where each cell in the grid is either white (`0`) or black (`1`). Your task is to count the number of black blocks in the grid. A black block is defined as any cell that has a `1` (black) and is part of a contiguous group of black cells. Two black cells are considered contiguous if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can we assume the grid dimensions `m` and `n` are positive integers?**
   - Yes, you can assume `m` and `n` are positive integers.
2. **Is the input guaranteed to be a well-formed grid (i.e., all rows have the same number of columns)?**
   - Yes.
3. **Should isolated black cells be counted as standalone blocks?**
   - Yes, isolated black cells are also considered black blocks.

## Strategy:
1. **Use Depth-First Search (DFS)**: We will use Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse through the grid. Whenever we encounter a black cell (`1`) that hasn't been visited, we will start a new DFS traversal from that cell, marking all contiguous black cells as visited.
2. **Count Black Blocks**: Each time a new DFS traversal starts, it indicates a new black block.
3. **Tracking Visited Cells**: We will use a 2D list to keep track of visited cells.

## Implementation Details:
- We'll iterate through each cell in the grid.
- If the cell is `1` and hasn't been visited, we will initiate a DFS from that cell.
- During the DFS, mark all connected black cells as visited.
- Count the number of DFS initiations which gives us the count of black blocks.

## Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\) where \(m\) is the number of rows and \(n\) is the number of columns.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\) due to the visited array.

## Code:

```python
def numBlackBlocks(grid):
    if not grid or not grid[0]:
        return 0
    
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    visited = [[False for _ in range(n)] for _ in range(m)]
    
    def dfs(x, y):
        if x < 0 or x >= m or y < 0 or y >= n or grid[x][y] == 0 or visited[x][y]:
            return
        visited[x][y] = True
        # Explore all 4 possible directions
        directions = [(1, 0), (-1, 0), (0, 1), (0, -1)]
        for dx, dy in directions:
            dfs(x + dx, y + dy)
    
    black_blocks_count = 0
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if grid[i][j] == 1 and not visited[i][j]:
                dfs(i, j)
                black_blocks_count += 1
    
    return black_blocks_count

# Example usage:
grid = [
    [1, 0, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 0, 1]
]

print(numBlackBlocks(grid))  # Output would be the number of black blocks
```

This implementation fulfills the criteria mentioned in the strategy, effectively counting the number of black blocks in the given grid.
