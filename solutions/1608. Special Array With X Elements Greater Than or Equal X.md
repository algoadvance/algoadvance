title:  Special Array With X Elements Greater Than or Equal X-out
permalink: /s1608
---

You are given an array `nums` of non-negative integers. `nums` is considered special if there exists a number `x` such that there are exactly `x` numbers in `nums` that are greater than or equal to `x`.

Return `x` if the array is special, otherwise return `-1`. Note that `x` does not have to be an element in `nums`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can `nums` contain duplicate values?
   - **A:** Yes, `nums` can contain duplicate values.
   
2. **Q:** What is the range of the length of `nums`?
   - **A:** The length can range from 1 to 100.
  
3. **Q:** What is the range of the values in `nums`?
   - **A:** The values are non-negative integers and can range from 0 to 1000.

4. **Q:** What should be the return value if no such `x` exists?
   - **A:** Return `-1` if no such `x` exists.

## Strategy
1. **Sort the Array:** We will start by sorting the array in non-decreasing order.
2. **Check for Each x:** Iterate over possible values of `x` from 0 to `n` (length of array):
   - For each `x`, count how many numbers in the array are greater than or equal to `x`.
   - If the count matches `x`, then return `x`.
3. **Return -1:** If no such `x` is found during the iteration, return `-1`.

## Code
Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
def specialArray(nums):
    nums.sort()
    n = len(nums)
    
    for x in range(n + 1):
        count = sum(1 for num in nums if num >= x)
        if count == x:
            return x
    
    return -1
```

## Explanation
1. **Sorting:** We first sort `nums` to ensure that we can easily count numbers greater than or equal to `x`.
2. **Iteration and Counting:**
   - We use a list comprehension within a `sum()` function to count the number of elements in `nums` that are greater than or equal to the current `x`.
   - If this count matches `x`, we return `x` as it satisfies the condition.
3. **Returning -1:** If the loop completes without finding such an `x`, we return `-1`.

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting:** `O(n log n)` where `n` is the length of the array.
- **Iteration and Counting:** The counting inside the loop takes `O(n)`, and as this happens `n + 1` times, the overall cost is `O(n^2)`.
  
Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n + n^2)`, which is dominated by `O(n^2)` due to the nested counting operation.

This approach should be efficient given the constraints (length up to 100).
