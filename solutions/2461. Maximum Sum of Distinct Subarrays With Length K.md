title:  Maximum Sum of Distinct Subarrays With Length K-out
permalink: /s2461
---

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Find the maximum sum of any subarray of length `k` that consists of distinct elements. If no such subarray exists, return `0`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,5,4,2,9,9,9], k = 3
Output: 15
Explanation: The subarrays of length 3 are:
[1,5,4], [5,4,2], [4,2,9], [2,9,9], [9,9,9]
The distinct sums of subarrays are [10, 11, 15], since [2,9,9] and [9,9,9] have repeated elements.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [4,4,4], k = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: The subarrays of length 3 are:
[4,4,4]
No subarray of length 3 consists of distinct elements.
```

### Constraints:
1. `1 <= k <= nums.length <= 10^5`
2. `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Should we always assume that inputs are valid and `k` is always less than or equal to the length of `nums`?
2. Can the subarray contain negative numbers? (Given the constraints, it looks like we are dealing with positive integers only.)

Let's proceed with the assumption that `nums` contains only positive numbers, and `k` is always valid.

## Strategy:

1. **Sliding Window Technique**: 
    - Use a sliding window of size `k` to check subarrays of length `k`.
    - Maintain a set to check if all elements in the current subarray are distinct.
    - Maintain a variable to keep track of the current sum of the subarray and the maximum sum seen so far.

2. **Edge Cases**:
    - If `k` is greater than the length of `nums`, it is invalid (but this is already excluded by constraints).
    - If `k` == 1, the result is the maximum element in `nums` since any single element subarray is distinct.

3. **Time Complexity**:
    - The approach should run in O(n) where `n` is the length of `nums` because every element is processed at most twice (once when it enters the window and once when it leaves).

Below is the implementation in Python:

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def maximumSumOfDistinctSubarrays(nums, k):
    if k > len(nums):
        return 0

    max_sum = 0
    current_sum = 0
    window_start = 0
    num_count = defaultdict(int)

    for i in range(len(nums)):
        num = nums[i]
        num_count[num] += 1
        current_sum += num
        
        if i >= k:
            outgoing_num = nums[window_start]
            current_sum -= outgoing_num
            if num_count[outgoing_num] == 1:
                del num_count[outgoing_num]
            else:
                num_count[outgoing_num] -= 1
            window_start += 1
        
        if i - window_start + 1 == k:
            if len(num_count) == k:  # all elements in the current window are distinct
                max_sum = max(max_sum, current_sum)
    
    return max_sum

# Example Usage:
print(maximumSumOfDistinctSubarrays([1,5,4,2,9,9,9], 3))  # Output: 15
print(maximumSumOfDistinctSubarrays([4,4,4], 3))         # Output: 0
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. Each element is added and removed from the window at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), due to the hashmap/set usage to store counts of at most `k` distinct elements.

This solution ensures that the algorithm runs efficiently even for large inputs due to its linear time complexity and fits within the problem constraints.
