Given a sorted array of distinct integers and a target value, return the index if the target is found. If not, return the index where it would be if it were inserted in order.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 5
Output: 2
```

Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 2
Output: 1
```

Example 3:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 7
Output: 4
```

Example 4:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,3,5,6], target = 0
Output: 0
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input array be empty?
   - No, the problem guarantee that the array will not be empty.
   
2. Are there any constraints on the input size?
   - No, but efficient O(log n) solution is expected which hints towards using binary search.

### Strategy
To achieve the O(log n) runtime complexity, we can use a binary search approach. Here's the strategy in detail:

1. **Initialize Pointers**: 
   - Set two pointers, `left` at the beginning (`0`) and `right` at the end (`len(nums) - 1`) of the array.

2. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - Compute the `middle` index.
   - If `nums[middle]` is equal to the `target`, return `middle`.
   - If `nums[middle]` is less than the `target`, move the `left` pointer to `middle + 1` to search in the right subarray.
   - If `nums[middle]` is greater than the `target`, move the `right` pointer to `middle - 1` to search in the left subarray.
   
3. **End Condition**:
   - If the loop ends without finding the target, the `left` pointer will indicate the correct insertion position.

### Code
```python
def search_insert(nums, target):
    left, right = 0, len(nums) - 1
    
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if nums[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif nums[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    
    return left
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n) because its complexity follows that of binary search.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This approach ensures efficient and correct insertion/index location of the target in the sorted array.
