title:  Find Elements in a Contaminated Binary Tree-out
permalink: /s1261
---
Given a binary tree with `root` labeled `-1`. Each node in this tree has been contaminated, and the goal is to recover the original tree by following these rules:
1. The root is assigned value 0.
2. For any node with value `x`, its left child is assigned value `2*x + 1` and its right child is assigned value `2*x + 2`.

Implement a class `FindElements` that contains the following methods:
- `__init__(self, root: TreeNode)`: Initializes the object with a contaminated binary tree's root.
- `find(self, target: int) -> bool`: Determines if a `target` value exists in the recovered tree.

### Example
```
Input
["FindElements", "find", "find"]
[[[-1, -1, -1, -1, null, -1, null]], [1], [3]]
Output
[null, true, false]
```

### Clarifying Questions
- Will the input tree always be valid as per the problem statement (i.e., not empty)?
- Can the `find` method be called multiple times, and should it be optimized for such use cases?
- Are all tree node values unique once recovered?

Now, let's move on to the implementation details.

## Strategy
### Initialization
1. During initialization, we'll traverse the tree starting from the root, assigning proper values to each node to "recover" the tree.

### Find Method
1. To efficiently check for the existence of a value, we can store all node values in a set after recovering the tree.

### Steps
- Use a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree and recover it.
- Store the values in a set for `O(1)` average-time complexity lookups.

## Code
Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
from typing import Optional

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val: int = 0, left: 'Optional[TreeNode]' = None, right: 'Optional[TreeNode]' = None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

class FindElements:
    def __init__(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]):
        self.root = root
        self.values = set()
        if self.root:
            self.recover_tree(self.root, 0)
    
    def recover_tree(self, node: Optional[TreeNode], value: int) -> None:
        if node:
            node.val = value
            self.values.add(value)
            self.recover_tree(node.left, 2 * value + 1)
            self.recover_tree(node.right, 2 * value + 2)
    
    def find(self, target: int) -> bool:
        return target in self.values
```

## Time Complexity
- **Initialization (`__init__` method)**: O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the traversal needed to recover node values.
- **Find method (`find` method)**: O(1) on average due to set lookup.

This approach ensures that we efficiently recover the tree and can quickly check for existence of any value in the tree.
