**393. UTF-8 Validation**

A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long, subjected to the following rules:

1. For a 1-byte character, the first bit is a 0, followed by its unicode code.
2. For an n-bytes character (n > 1), the first n bits are all 1's, the n+1 bit is 0, followed by n-1 bytes with the most significant 2 bits being 10.

This is how the UTF-8 encoding would work:

- 1-byte character:   0xxxxxxx
- 2-byte character:   110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
- 3-byte character:   1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
- 4-byte character:   11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx

Given an array of integers representing the data, return whether it is a valid UTF-8 encoding.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input and Output**:
   - Input: A list of integers.
   - Output: Boolean value indicating whether the given data represents a valid UTF-8 encoding.

2. **Value Range**:
   - Each integer in the input list can range from 0 to 255, representing one byte.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Input list length is zero.
   - Input list contains an improperly terminated multi-byte character.

## Strategy

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - If data length is 0, return True, as an empty string is trivially valid.

2. **Byte Classification**:
   - For each byte, classify it:
     - 1-byte character: first bit `0`.
     - 2-byte character: starts with `110`.
     - 3-byte character: starts with `1110`.
     - 4-byte character: starts with `11110`.

3. **Validate Subsequent Bytes**:
   - For multi-byte characters, ensure that the subsequent bytes start with `10`.

4. **Iterative Check**:
   - Iterate through bytes, deducing the number of required subsequent bytes for each multi-byte character and validate all necessary conditions.

## Code

```python
from typing import List

def validUtf8(data: List[int]) -> bool:
    def is_valid_byte(byte):
        return (byte & 0b11000000) == 0b10000000

    i = 0
    while i < len(data):
        byte = data[i]
        if (byte & 0b10000000) == 0:  # 1-byte character
            i += 1
            continue

        len_prefix = 0
        mask = 0b10000000
        while (byte & mask) != 0:
            len_prefix += 1
            mask >>= 1

        if len_prefix == 1 or len_prefix > 4:  # Invalid prefix length (<= 4 bytes allowed)
            return False

        for j in range(1, len_prefix):
            if i + j >= len(data) or not is_valid_byte(data[i + j]):
                return False

        i += len_prefix
    
    return True
```

## Time Complexity

- **O(n)**: We are iterating through the list of bytes once, making the solution linear in terms of data length.

### Explanation
1. **is_valid_byte Function**: This helper function checks if a byte starts with `10`, denoting it's a valid continuation byte.
2. **Iteration**:
   - For each byte in the data:
     - If the byte starts with `0`, it's a single byte character.
     - If it starts with `1`, count the `1`s at the start to determine the length of the multi-byte character.
     - Validate the following bytes.
3. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where multi-byte characters are not properly terminated or overflow the list.

By following this structured approach, the solution ensures that we only validate valid UTF-8 sequences efficiently.
