title:  Maximum Strength of a Group-out
permalink: /s2708
---
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` representing the score of each student in a group. The strength of the group is defined as the product of the scores of all students in the group.

Write a function `maxStrength(nums: List[int]) -> int` that returns the maximum strength of a group that can be made by excluding zero or more students.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 13`
- `-9 <= nums[i] <= 9`

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can the array include the number zero?**
   - Yes, the array can include zero.
   
2. **Are we guaranteed to have at least one student in the group?**
   - Yes, according to the constraints `nums` will always have at least one element.

3. **Should we consider both positive and negative scores?**
   - Yes, the array `nums` may include negative scores, and the strategy should account for optimally including these scores to maximize the product.

## Strategy:
1. **Special Cases:**
   - If `nums` contains only one non-negative known-not-zero integer, return that integer.
   - If `nums` contains only zeroes, return zero as any group formed would have a product of zero.
   
2. **General Case:**
   - For positive numbers, include all positive values since they increase the product.
   - For negative numbers, include pairs of negatives because two negatives multiply to a positive. If there's an odd number of negative numbers, exclude the negative number with the smallest absolute value.
   - If there's a zero, it does not inherently contribute positively but does not harm exclusion as zeros can be skipped.

### Steps:
1. Filter out zeroes.
2. Split the remaining numbers into positive and negative.
3. Sort negatives by absolute value to easily manage pairing.
4. If there's an odd count of negative numbers, discard the "least negative" one.
5. Calculate the product of the remaining values.

### Time Complexity:
- Sorting the negatives list will take \(O(n \log n)\) time.
- Calculating the product will take \(O(n)\) time.

Let's implement the solution.

## Code:

```python
from typing import List

def maxStrength(nums: List[int]) -> int:
    if not nums:
        return 0
    
    # Remove all zeroes since they are neutral in product calculations
    nums = [num for num in nums if num != 0]
    
    if not nums: 
        return 0
    
    # Separate positives and negatives
    positives = [num for num in nums if num > 0]
    negatives = [num for num in nums if num < 0]
    
    # sort negatives to handle them by their absolute size
    negatives.sort()
    
    # If we have an odd number of negative numbers, exclude the smallest
    if len(negatives) % 2 != 0:
        negatives.pop(0)
    
    result = 1
    for num in positives + negatives:
        result *= num
    
    return result

# Example usage:
# nums = [3, -1, -1, 4]
# print(maxStrength(nums))  # Output should be 12 (since 3 * 4 * -1 * -1 == 12)
```

This function should accurately compute the maximum strength of a group adhering to the rules and constraints provided. You can test with more sample inputs to ensure robustness.
