title:  Minimum Operations to Make Median of Array Equal to K-out
permalink: /s3107
---

Given a 0-indexed array `nums` of size `n`, operations involve changing any element to any integer. The goal is to perform the minimum number of operations such that the median of `nums` equals a given integer `k`.

A `median` of an array of size `n` is:
- The `((n - 1) / 2)`-th element after sorting the array if `n` is odd.
- If `n` is even, it's the average of the `((n / 2) - 1)`-th and `(n / 2)`-th elements after sorting.

Return the minimum number of operations required.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all array elements initially positive integers or can they be negative as well?**
    - Let's assume that elements can be both positive and negative.
2. **Do we have any constraints on the length of the array `n`?**
    - Let's proceed assuming `n` can be fairly large.
3. **Should the array be mutable throughout the process, or do we need to preserve the initial state of the array?**
    - Assume we can modify the array in place.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Key Position**: The key position to focus on is the middle element in the sorted version of the array, since the problem specifically deals with the median. For this, we identify the index `mid` which is `(n // 2)` for 1-based indexing because we start from 0.
2. **Initial Median Check**: Calculate the median of the array after sorting.
   - If the median already equals `k`, return `0`.
3. **Adjust for Median**:
   - If the current median < `k`, increase the number at the median index (or adjust larger).
   - If the current median > `k`, decrease the number at the median index (or adjust smaller).

### Code

```python
def min_operations_to_make_median_equal_to_k(nums, k):
    nums.sort()
    n = len(nums)
    mid = (n - 1) // 2  # Index of the median for 0-indexed array
    
    median = nums[mid]
    if median == k:
        return 0
    
    # If current median < k, move towards increasing elements to make median == k
    left_operations = sum(1 for i in range(mid + 1) if nums[i] < k)
    # If current median > k, move towards decreasing elements to make median == k
    right_operations = sum(1 for i in range(mid, n) if nums[i] > k)
    
    return min(left_operations, right_operations)  # Minimize the number of operations

# Example Usage
print(min_operations_to_make_median_equal_to_k([1, 3, 2, 6], 3))  # Example call
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting**: The time complexity of sorting the array is `O(n log n)`.
2. **Counting operations**: This involves iterating through the array, with a complexity of `O(n)`.

Thus, the total time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, so it is `O(n log n)`.

This approach ensures we efficiently determine the minimum operations required to make the median of the array equal to `k`.
