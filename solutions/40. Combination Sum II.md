title:  Combination Sum II-out
permalink: /s40
---

Given an array of candidate numbers (`candidates`) and a target number (`target`), find all unique combinations in `candidates` where the candidate numbers sum to `target`.

Each number in `candidates` may only be used once in the combination.

**Note:**
- All numbers (including `target`) will be positive integers.
- The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

### Example

```python
Input: candidates = [10,1,2,7,6,1,5], target = 8
Output: [[1,1,6],[1,2,5],[1,7],[2,6]]

Input: candidates = [2,5,2,1,2], target = 5
Output: [[1,2,2],[5]]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the candidates array contain negative numbers?**
   No, all numbers are positive integers.

2. **Can the target number be zero?**
   No, the target number will always be a positive integer.

3. **Is the order of combinations in the output important?**
   No, the order of combinations in the output is not important.

4. **Can the candidates array contain duplicates?**
   Yes, the array can contain duplicates, but the combinations must be unique.

## Strategy

1. **Sort the Array**
   - Sorting helps us easily skip duplicate combinations and prune the search space for more efficient backtracking.

2. **Backtracking**
   - Use backtracking to generate combinations. If the target becomes zero, we store the current combination.
   - If the target becomes negative or we have processed all elements, we backtrack.
   - We skip duplicates during the generation of combinations to avoid the generation of identical combinations.

3. **Base Conditions**
   - If the target is zero, add the current combination to the result.
   - If the target is less than zero or we have exhausted the list, return without adding the combination.

## Solution with Code

```python
def combinationSum2(candidates, target):
    def backtrack(start, end, temp_list, target):
        if target == 0:
            res.append(temp_list[:])
            return
        if target < 0:
            return
        for i in range(start, end):
            if i > start and candidates[i] == candidates[i - 1]:
                continue
            temp_list.append(candidates[i])
            backtrack(i + 1, end, temp_list, target - candidates[i])
            temp_list.pop()

    candidates.sort()
    res = []
    backtrack(0, len(candidates), [], target)
    return res

# Example Usage
candidates = [10, 1, 2, 7, 6, 1, 5]
target = 8
print(combinationSum2(candidates, target)) # Output: [[1,1,6], [1,2,5], [1,7], [2,6]]
```

## Time Complexity

The overall time complexity is difficult to determine exactly due to the variable nature of backtracking, but we can provide an estimate:
- **Sorting the candidates** has a complexity of \(O(n \log n)\).
- The backtracking function generates all possible combinations, so in the worst case, it will explore 2^n combinations where n is the length of the candidates. Hence, the backtracking step has an approximate upper bound complexity of \(O(2^n)\).

Thus, the total estimated time complexity is \(O(n \log n + 2^n)\).

This time complexity can vary significantly based on the input size and the values of the target and candidates array.
