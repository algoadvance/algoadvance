title:  Maximize Number of Nice Divisors-out
permalink: /s1808
---

You are given a positive integer `primeFactors`. You need to maximize the number of divisors of a number `n` that you will create by using `primeFactors` as the total number of prime factors (not necessarily distinct). Specifically, `n` should be a product of these primes. Return the maximum number of divisors you can achieve for a number `n` as an integer. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Clarifying Questions

To ensure we fully understand the problem, let's consider some clarifying questions:
1. **Can the prime factors repeat?**
   - Yes, the problem statement mentions using `primeFactors` as the total number of prime factors, indicating repetitions are allowed.
2. **Are we restricted to specific primes?**
   - The problem does not mention specific primes, so we can assume any primes are valid.
3. **Are there constraints on `primeFactors`?**
   - In competitive problems, we generally assume `primeFactors` is a positive integer fitting within reasonable limits. 

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to consider a few mathematical facts:
1. **Prime Factor Combinations:** The number `n` could be best maximized if you can use the prime factors in such a way that their product's divisors are maximized.
2. **Divisors of a Number Calculations:** If `n = p1^a * p2^b * ... * pk^z`, the total number of divisors of `n` is given by `(a + 1) * (b + 1) * ... * (z + 1)`.
3. **Optimal Product Strategy:** Breaking down the total prime factors into smaller factors can maximize the product under modular conditions.

We need to find the best way to break `primeFactors` into smaller integers such that their product is maximized under modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).
Hereâ€™s a structured approach:

1. **Breaking Down Prime Factors:**
   - When breaking down a number, the factors 3 are optimal for maximizing the product because \(3\) has properties that lead to a higher product sum return when compared to other smaller factors.
   - If remainder is `1`, it is better to form `4` by distributing `1` as `3` becomes `9` when `4` is greater.

2. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Given the constraints can make the number very large, we'll use modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to handle overflow issues.

### Code Implementation

```python
MOD = 10**9 + 7

def maxNiceDivisors(primeFactors: int) -> int:
    if primeFactors <= 3:
        return primeFactors
    
    # maximize the product of factors 3
    quotient, remainder = divmod(primeFactors, 3)
    
    if remainder == 0:
        result = pow(3, quotient, MOD)
    elif remainder == 1:
        result = (pow(3, quotient - 1, MOD) * 4) % MOD
    else:  # remainder == 2
        result = (pow(3, quotient, MOD) * 2) % MOD
    
    return result

# Test the function with an example
print(maxNiceDivisors(5))  # Example test case
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is mainly dominated by the power function `pow`, which has a complexity of \(O(\log n)\) due to its efficient implementation for modular exponentiation. Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(\log primeFactors)\).

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently finds the maximum number of divisors possible by decomposing the count of prime factors into smaller integers that maximize the product under modular arithmetic. This ensures both optimality and efficiency.
