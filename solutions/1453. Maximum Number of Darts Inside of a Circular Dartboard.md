title:  Maximum Number of Darts Inside of a Circular Dartboard-out
permalink: /s1453
---

We are given a list of `n` points on a 2D plane where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represent the coordinates of the `i-th` point. We are also given a radius `r`. The task is to find the maximum number of points that lie inside or on the boundary of a circular dartboard with radius `r` that can be placed anywhere on the plane.

An optimal solution must consider placing the circle at strategic points such that the overlap with the maximum number of points is maximized.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Points on Boundary:** Are points that lie exactly on the circle boundary counted as inside the circle?
   - **Clarification:** Yes, points on the boundary are considered as inside the circle.
   
2. **Input Constraints:**
   - **Number of Points (n):** What is the range for number of points, `n`?
     - Typically `1 <= n <= 100` for such problems.
   - **Radius (r):** What is the range for the radius, `r`?
     - `1 <= r <= 10^3`.

3. **Coordinates Range:** What is the range for `xi` and `yi`?
   - Points coordinates typically range from `-10^4` to `10^4`.

## Strategy

1. **Pairwise Consideration:** Iterate through every pair of points and consider the circle whose diameter is the distance between these two points. The center of this circle is always at the midpoint of these two points.
  
2. **Compute Circle Centers:** For each pair of points, there can be two possible circle centers (since the radius can extend in either direction perpendicular to the line joining these two points).

3. **Count Points Inside Circle:** For each potential circle, count the number of points that lie inside or on the boundary of the circle.

4. **Optimization:** Keep track of the maximum count encountered.

The distance and circle calculations involve straightforward geometry: 
   - Distance between two points (Euclidean distance).
   - Geometry to find the circle's center when two points are given (either through perpendicular bisectors or using trigonometric properties).

## Code

Here's a Python implementation of the described strategy:

```python
import math
from itertools import combinations

def num_points(points, r):
    def get_circle_center(p1, p2, r):
        (x1, y1), (x2, y2) = p1, p2
        d = math.hypot(x2 - x1, y2 - y1)
        if d > 2 * r:
            return []
        midx, midy = (x1 + x2) / 2, (y1 + y2) / 2
        if d == 0:
            return [(midx, midy)]
        h = (r**2 - (d / 2)**2) ** 0.5
        # (dy/d, -dx/d) is a vector perpendicular to (dx, dy) with length 1
        dx, dy = (y2 - y1) / d, (x2 - x1) / d
        center1 = (midx + h * -dy, midy + h * dx)
        center2 = (midx - h * -dy, midy - h * dx)
        return [center1, center2]
    
    def count_points_in_circle(center, r):
        cx, cy = center
        count = 0
        for px, py in points:
            if math.hypot(px - cx, py - cy) <= r:
                count += 1
        return count
    
    max_points = 1
    for p1, p2 in combinations(points, 2):
        for center in get_circle_center(p1, p2, r):
            max_points = max(max_points, count_points_in_circle(center, r))
    
    return max_points

# Example usage
points = [[-2,0],[2,0],[0,2],[0,-2]]
r = 2
print(num_points(points, r))  # Output: 4
```

## Time Complexity

- **Overall Complexity:** 
  - Generating all pairs of points: \(O(n^2)\)
  - Calculating circle centers and counting points for each pair: \(O(n)\)

Thus, the total time complexity is \(O(n^3)\).

Considering the constraints, this complexity is acceptable and should perform efficiently within the given limits.
