You are tasked with writing an algorithm to solve the "Fizz Buzz" problem. Given an integer `n`, return a string array `answer` (1-indexed) where:

- `answer[i] == "FizzBuzz"` if `i` is divisible by 3 and 5.
- `answer[i] == "Fizz"` if `i` is divisible by 3.
- `answer[i] == "Buzz"` if `i` is divisible by 5.
- `answer[i] == i` (as a string) if none of the above conditions are true.

### Example:

**Input:** `n = 15`

**Output:** `["1", "2", "Fizz", "4", "Buzz", "Fizz", "7", "8", "Fizz", "Buzz", "11", "Fizz", "13", "14", "FizzBuzz"]`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of `n`**: What is the range of the input integer `n`?
    - Typically, `1 <= n <= 10^4`.
2. **Edge Cases**: Should we consider edge cases where `n` is the smallest possible value (i.e., `n = 1`)?
    - Yes, we should ensure the solution works for the minimum value of `n`.

## Strategy

The strategy is straightforward:
1. We will iterate from `1` to `n`, and for each number:
   - If it is divisible by both 3 and 5, we add "FizzBuzz" to the list.
   - If it is divisible by only 3, we add "Fizz" to the list.
   - If it is divisible by only 5, we add "Buzz" to the list.
   - Otherwise, we add the number itself (converted to string).

### Implementation Steps:
1. Initialize an empty list `answer` to store the result.
2. Loop from `1` to `n` (both inclusive).
3. For each `i` in this range, use conditional checks to determine the appropriate string to append to the list.
4. Return the populated list `answer` at the end.

## Code

```python
def fizzBuzz(n: int):
    answer = []

    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        if i % 3 == 0 and i % 5 == 0:
            answer.append("FizzBuzz")
        elif i % 3 == 0:
            answer.append("Fizz")
        elif i % 5 == 0:
            answer.append("Buzz")
        else:
            answer.append(str(i))
    
    return answer

# Example Usage
n = 15
print(fizzBuzz(n))  # Output: ["1", "2", "Fizz", "4", "Buzz", "Fizz", "7", "8", "Fizz", "Buzz", "11", "Fizz", "13", "14", "FizzBuzz"]
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The solution iterates through numbers from `1` to `n`, performing constant-time operations for each number.
  - Thus, the time complexity is **O(n)**.
  
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also **O(n)** as we store the result in a list that contains `n` elements.

This concludes the solution for the Fizz Buzz problem using a simple and efficient algorithm.
