title:  Minimum Operations to Convert Number-out
permalink: /s2059
---

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` containing distinct numbers and an integer `start`. You are also given an integer `goal`.

There is an integer `x` that is initially `start`, and you want to perform operations to convert it to `goal`. Your task is to find and return the minimum number of operations you need to perform to convert `start` into `goal`.

In one operation, you can pick any number from nums and add, subtract, or XOR it with `x`. 
Note: `x` should always be in the range [0, 1000] after each operation.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to convert `start` into `goal`, or -1 if it's not possible.

### Example
```text
Input: nums = [2, 4, 12], start = 2, goal = 12
Output: 2
Explanation: In the first operation, we can choose the number 4 from nums and add it to 2 to get 6. In the second operation, we can choose the number 6 from nums and add it to 6 to get 12.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Data Constraints:**
   - Are `nums` elements always distinct?
   - Are `start` and `goal` both within the range [0, 1000]?

2. **Operation Constraints:**
   - Can `x` be negative during the process, or must it always be within [0, 1000]?
   - Is there a limit to the number of operations?

## Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - Use BFS to explore the minimum operations required to reach `goal`. At each level of the BFS, apply all possible operations (+, -, XOR) using each element from `nums`.
   - Ensure `x` stays within the valid range [0, 1000] during operations.
   - If any intermediate result equals the goal, return the current operation count.

2. **Tracking State:**
   - Use a set to track visited states to avoid redundant calculations and infinite loops.

## Code

```python
from collections import deque

def minOperations(nums, start, goal):
    # Initialize BFS queue
    queue = deque([(start, 0)])  # (current_value, steps_count)
    visited = set([start])
    
    while queue:
        current_value, steps = queue.popleft()
        
        if current_value == goal:
            return steps
        
        for num in nums:
            for new_value in [current_value + num, current_value - num, current_value ^ num]:
                if new_value == goal:
                    return steps + 1
                if 0 <= new_value <= 1000 and new_value not in visited:
                    visited.add(new_value)
                    queue.append((new_value, steps + 1))
    
    return -1  # If goal is not reachable

# Example usage
print(minOperations([2, 4, 12], 2, 12))  # Output: 2
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this BFS approach can be roughly estimated as follows:
- **State Explosion:** Each state can branch up to `3 * len(nums)` new states (each number in `nums` can create three new states).
- **Visited Tracking:** We only allow states within [0, 1000], so at most, we track `1001` unique states.

Thus, in the worst case:
- **Combined Complexity:** `O(1000 * 3 * len(nums))` or simplified to `O(3000 * len(nums))`, effectively linear with respect to `nums`.

This method ensures efficient exploration, avoiding redundant calculations by tracking visited states and limiting the state space to valid values.
