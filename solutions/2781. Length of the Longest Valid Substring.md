title:  Length of the Longest Valid Substring-out
permalink: /s2781
---

You are given a string `word` and a list `forbidden` of strings. A valid substring is a substring that does not contain any string from `forbidden` as a subsequence. Find the length of the longest valid substring.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What is the length of the string `word`?
    - What is the length of the `forbidden` list and the strings within it?
    - Are there any constraints on the characters in `word` and `forbidden`?

2. **Output Specifications:**
    - Is the output expected to be a single integer representing the length of the longest valid substring?

3. **Edge Cases:**
    - What if `forbidden` is empty?
    - What if `word` is an empty string?
    - Can `forbidden` contain any string that isn't a subsequence of `word`?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we'll use the sliding window approach. The plan is to iterate through every possible window (substring) of `word` and check if it contains any string from `forbidden`. In practice, to manage efficiency, we'll optimize our search:

1. **Precompute Forbidden Patterns:**
   - Store all forbidden strings in a set for O(1) look-up.
   
2. **Two-Pointer Technique:**
   - Use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to represent the current window.
   - Expand the `right` pointer to include more characters.
   - Move the `left` pointer if the current window becomes invalid due to containing a forbidden string.
   - Keep track of the longest valid window.

3. **Substring Validation:**
   - Check the inclusion of any forbidden string in the current window by slicing it and checking against the forbidden set.

### Code

Hereâ€™s how we can implement this:

```python
def longestValidSubstring(word, forbidden):
    forbidden_set = set(forbidden)
    n = len(word)
    longest_length = 0
    left = 0

    def is_valid(substring):
        for forb_str in forbidden_set:
            if forb_str in substring:
                return False
        return True

    for right in range(n):
        while left <= right and not is_valid(word[left:right+1]):
            left += 1
        longest_length = max(longest_length, right - left + 1)
    
    return longest_length

# Example usage:
# word = "abcde"
# forbidden = ["a", "bd"]
# Output should be the length of the longest valid substring
# longestValidSubstring(word, forbidden)
```

### Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing (forbidden set creation):** O(F) where F is the total length of all strings in `forbidden`.
- **Main Loop:** O(n^2) in the worst case since in each iteration, we slice the string from `left` to `right` and check against the forbidden set.

However, the practical time complexity is tough to analyze due to the nested search. If `forbidden` patterns are few and small, the approach can be fast. For very large `forbidden` patterns, additional optimizations may be necessary, such as advanced string matching algorithms (e.g., Aho-Corasick).

### Optimization Note

To further optimize the solution, we could preprocess the `word` to mark positions invalidated by forbidden patterns, improving the check efficiency. However, this would require a more complex data structure and preprocessing logic, and may be overengineering for some use cases.
