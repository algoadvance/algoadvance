title:  Count Substrings Starting and Ending with Given Character-out
permalink: /s3084
---
You are given a string `s` and a character `c`. Your task is to count the number of substrings within `s` that start and end with the character `c`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
   - Can the string `s` contain characters other than alphabets?
   - Should we consider overlapping substrings, or only distinct ones count?

2. **Character `c`**:
   - Will `c` always be a single character?
   
3. **Output**:
   - Should we print the count or return it from a function?

### Code

```python
def count_substrings(s, c):
    count = 0
    n = len(s)
    
    # Store indices of character 'c' in the string
    indices = [i for i in range(n) if s[i] == c]
    
    # For each pair of indices, consider start and end of substring
    for i in range(len(indices)):
        for j in range(i, len(indices)):
            count += 1
            
    return count

# Example usage
s = "abacabad"
c = 'a'
print(count_substrings(s, c))  # Output should be 10 (explained below)
```

### Strategy
1. **Identify Positions**: First, we identify all positions of the character `c` in the string `s`.
2. **Count Substrings**: For each pair of indices, count the number of valid substrings from the identified positions in a nested loop.
3. **Iterate and Count**: For each starting index of `c`, iterate over possible ending indices that form valid substrings.
4. **Efficiency**: This approach ensures that we only look at the positions with the character `c`, reducing unnecessary checks.

### Explanation with Example

Given:
- `s = "abacabad"`
- `c = 'a'`

Indices where `c` occurs: `[0, 2, 4, 6]`

Valid Substrings:
1. From index 0 to 0 (1)
2. From index 0 to 2 (2)
3. From index 0 to 4 (3)
4. From index 0 to 6 (4)
5. From index 2 to 2 (5)
6. From index 2 to 4 (6)
7. From index 2 to 6 (7)
8. From index 4 to 4 (8)
9. From index 4 to 6 (9)
10. From index 6 to 6 (10)

Hence, the function should return 10.

### Time Complexity
- **Finding Indices**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- **Counting Substrings**: `O(k^2)`, where `k` is the number of times the character `c` appears in `s`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n + k^2)**, which should be efficient for strings of reasonable length and character frequency.
