title:  Difference of Number of Distinct Values on Diagonals-out
permalink: /s2711
---

Given a `m x n` matrix, return a new matrix `answer` where `answer[i][j]` is the absolute difference between the number of distinct values in the diagonal going from `(0,0)` to `(i,j)` and the diagonal going from `(i,j)` to `(m-1,n-1)`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What are the sizes of the matrix dimensions (`m` and `n`)?
2. Is there any constraint on the values within the matrix?
3. Should we consider all the diagonal values starting or ending at `(i,j)` to calculate the distinct values?
4. Do the diagonals include the element at `(i,j)`?

## Strategy

1. For each element in the matrix `(i,j)`, identify the distinct values in the top-left to `(i,j)` diagonal and the bottom-right to `(i,j)` diagonal.
2. Calculate the absolute difference between the distinct values in both diagonals.
3. Store this difference in the corresponding cell of the `answer` matrix.
4. Return the `answer` matrix.

### Steps:
1. Define auxiliary functions to extract the diagonal elements for both the top-left and bottom-right diagonals.
2. Iterate through each element in the matrix to compute the number of distinct values in both diagonals.
3. Compute the absolute difference and create the `answer` matrix accordingly.

### Time Complexity
- Extracting values from both diagonals for one element: O(min(m, n))
- Total time complexity considering all elements: O(m * n * min(m, n))

## Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict


def distinct_on_diagonal(matrix, n_rows, n_cols, r, c, is_top_left=True):
    distinct_elements = set()
    while 0 <= r < n_rows and 0 <= c < n_cols:
        distinct_elements.add(matrix[r][c])
        if is_top_left:
            r -= 1
            c -= 1
        else:
            r += 1
            c += 1
    return len(distinct_elements)


def difference_of_distinct_values_on_diagonals(matrix):
    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
        return []

    n_rows, n_cols = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    answer = [[0] * n_cols for _ in range(n_rows)]

    for i in range(n_rows):
        for j in range(n_cols):
            top_left_distinct_count = distinct_on_diagonal(matrix, n_rows, n_cols, i, j)
            bottom_right_distinct_count = distinct_on_diagonal(matrix, n_rows, n_cols, i, j, is_top_left=False)
            answer[i][j] = abs(top_left_distinct_count - bottom_right_distinct_count)

    return answer

# Example usage:
matrix = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [4, 1, 6],
    [7, 8, 1]
]
result = difference_of_distinct_values_on_diagonals(matrix)
print(result)  # Example output, final will depend on actual implementation and understanding
```

### Note:
- The `distinct_on_diagonal` function handles the traversal through both top-left to `(i,j)` and `(i,j)` to bottom-right diagonals.
- You might need slight tweaking based on edge cases and exact requirements from the problem statement.
