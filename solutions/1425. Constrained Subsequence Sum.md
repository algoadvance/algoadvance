title:  Constrained Subsequence Sum-out
permalink: /s1425
---

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum sum of a non-empty subsequence of `nums` such that any two consecutive elements of the subsequence differ by at most `k` indices.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can elements be negative?**
   - Yes, the array can contain negative integers.
   
2. **What is the length of the `nums` array?**
   - The length can be up to \(10^5\).

3. **Do the values of `k` have any constraints?**
   - The value of `k` will be a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq \text{length of the array}\).

4. **What is the expected output?**
   - The maximum possible sum of a non-empty subsequence where the difference between the indices of chosen elements is at most `k`.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach:**
   - We'll use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum sum of a subsequence ending at index `i`.
   - To efficiently track the maximum value within the sliding window of size `k`, we'll use a deque (double-ended queue).

2. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize the `dp` array with the same values as `nums` because each element itself can be the start of a subsequence.

3. **Sliding Window Optimization:**
   - Use a deque to keep track of the indices of elements that might contribute to the maximum sum within the window of last `k` elements.

4. **Updating DP Array:**
   - For each element, update `dp[i]` by adding the maximum value within the last `k` indices to `nums[i]`.

5. **Max Sum:**
   - The result will be the maximum value in the `dp` array.

### Code

```python
from collections import deque

def constrainedSubsetSum(nums, k):
    n = len(nums)
    dp = nums[:]  # Initializing dp array with values of nums
    dq = deque()  # This will store indices
    
    for i in range(n):
        # If the deque is not empty, add the maximum value from the front of the deque to dp[i]
        dp[i] += dp[dq[0]] if dq else 0
        
        # Maintain deque such that it only holds indices within the window of size k
        if dq and dq[0] == i - k:  # Remove elements not within the constraint of k
            dq.popleft()
        
        # Maintain deque in decreasing order of dp values for the sliding window maximum
        while dq and dp[dq[-1]] <= dp[i]:
            dq.pop()
        
        dq.append(i)
    
    return max(dp)

# Example Usage
nums = [10, 2, -10, 5, 20]
k = 2
print(constrainedSubsetSum(nums, k))  # Output should be 37
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
  - Each element is processed at most twice (added and removed from the deque), resulting in a linear time complexity.
  
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(k)\)
  - The space used by the deque is at most `k`, but the overall space complexity including the `dp` array is \(O(n)\).
