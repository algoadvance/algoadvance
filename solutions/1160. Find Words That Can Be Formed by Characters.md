title:  Find Words That Can Be Formed by Characters-out
permalink: /s1160
---

You are given an array of strings `words` and a string `chars`. A string is **good** if it can be formed by characters from `chars` (each character can only be used once). Return the sum of lengths of all good strings in `words`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"], chars = "atach"
Output: 6
Explanation: The strings that can be formed are "cat" and "hat" so the answer is 3 + 3 = 6.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: words = ["hello","world","leetcode"], chars = "welldonehoneyr"
Output: 10
Explanation: The strings that can be formed are "hello" and "world" so the answer is 5 + 5 = 10.
```

### Constraints:
- 1 <= words.length <= 1000
- 1 <= words[i].length, chars.length <= 100
- All strings contain lowercase English letters only.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Do we need to consider the frequency of characters in `chars` when forming words?**  
   Yes, each character in `chars` can only be used as many times as it appears in `chars`.

2. **Should we assume that all inputs contain only lowercase English letters?**  
   Yes, based on the problem statement.

---

### Strategy

1. **Count the Frequency of Characters in the `chars` String:**  
   Use Python's `collections.Counter` to count the frequency of each character in `chars`.

2. **Check Each Word:**  
   For each word in `words`, count the frequency of each character. Check if each character in the word can be formed using the characters in `chars` by comparing their counts.

3. **Sum the Lengths of Valid Words:**  
   If a word can be formed from `chars`, add its length to the sum.

### Time Complexity
- Counting characters in `chars` takes \(O(C)\) where \(C\) is the length of `chars`.
- For each word, counting characters takes \(O(W)\) where \(W\) is the length of the word.
- Checking if a word can be formed takes \(O(W)\) as well.
- Overall, the complexity is \(O(N * W)\) where:
  - \(N\) is the number of words.
  - \(W\) is the average length of the words.

### Code

```python
from collections import Counter

def countCharacters(words, chars):
    # Step 1: Count the frequency of each character in chars
    char_count = Counter(chars)
    total_length = 0
    
    # Step 2: Process each word in words
    for word in words:
        word_count = Counter(word)
        
        # Check if the word can be formed by comparing character counts
        can_form = True
        for char in word_count:
            if word_count[char] > char_count.get(char, 0):
                can_form = False
                break
        
        # If the word can be formed, add its length to total_length
        if can_form:
            total_length += len(word)
    
    return total_length

# Example usage
words = ["cat","bt","hat","tree"]
chars = "atach"
print(countCharacters(words, chars))  # Output: 6
```

This code correctly implements the solution by counting character frequencies and verifying each word against the available characters in `chars`. The strategy ensures that we handle each word only in linear time relative to its length, making the solution efficient given the problem constraints.
