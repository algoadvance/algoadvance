title:  Query Kth Smallest Trimmed Number-out
permalink: /s2343
---

You are given a 0-indexed array of strings `nums`, where each string is of the same length and consists only of digits. You are also given a 2D integer array `queries`, where `queries[i] = [k, trim]`. For each `queries[i]`, you need to determine the `k`-th smallest trimmed number in the array `nums` after trimming each number to its rightmost `trim` digits. Each `queries[i]` is processed independently.

Return an array `answer` of the same length as `queries`, where `answer[i]` is the answer to the `i-th` query.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - `nums` array length, say `n`: \(1 \leq n \leq 100$
    - Length of each string in `nums`, say `m`: \(1 \leq m \leq 100\)
    - `queries` array length, say `q`: \(1 \leq q \leq 100\)
    - Values of `k` will be 1-indexed and within the range `1` to `n`.
    - Values of `trim` will be within the range `1` to `m`.

2. **Output**:
    - For each query, return the `k`-th smallest trimmed number in its trimmed form.

### Strategy

Given the constraints, a brute force approach should be efficient enough. Here's the plan for solving the problem:

1. **Trim and Extract**: For each query, trim each number in `nums` to its rightmost `trim` digits.
2. **Sort**: Sort the trimmed numbers along with their original indices.
3. **Retrieve k-th Smallest**: The `k-th` smallest element after sorting is the answer to the current query.

### Code

Here is the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def smallestTrimmedNumbers(nums, queries):
    result = []
    
    for k, trim in queries:
        # Create a list of tuples (trimmed_number, original_index)
        trimmed = [(num[-trim:], idx) for idx, num in enumerate(nums)]
        
        # Sort the trimmed list by the trimmed_number, and then by original_index
        trimmed.sort()
        
        # Get the k-th smallest trimmed number's original index
        result.append(trimmed[k-1][1])
    
    return result
```

### Time Complexity

- **Trimming**: Each number trimming is \(O(m)\), which is done for each of the `n` elements. So, overall \(O(n \cdot m)\) for trimming operation.
- **Sorting**: For each query, sorting `n` elements gives \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Total Complexity Per Query**: \(O(n \cdot m + n \log n)\).
- Given `q` queries, the total complexity is \(O(q \cdot (n \cdot m + n \log n))\), which should be feasible given the constraints.

This approach ensures that each query is handled independently, and the code remains clear and efficient.
