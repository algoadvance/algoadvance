title:  Divide Nodes Into the Maximum Number of Groups-out
permalink: /s2493
---

You are given a connected undirected graph with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n` and `m` edges. Your goal is to divide the nodes into the maximum number of groups such that no two adjacent nodes are in the same group.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are `n` and `m`?**
   - `n` is the number of nodes.
   - `m` is the number of edges.

2. **What is the expected output?**
   - The maximum number of groups into which you can divide the nodes such that no two adjacent nodes belong to the same group.

3. **Are there any constraints on `n` and `m`?**
   - Assume the usual constraints: `1 <= n <= 500` and `0 <= m <= n * (n - 1) / 2`.

4. **Is this a bipartite graph problem?**
   - Yes, it is closely related to checking if a graph is bipartite and can be solved using bipartite graph properties but extended to multi-partite.

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the graph.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) for Bipartiteness:**
   - Use BFS to try coloring the graph such that no two adjacent nodes share the same color. If we can only use 2 colors, it's a bipartite graph. If not, we might be able to use more.

   - The number of colors used in coloring the graph would give us the number of groups.

3. **Multi-partiteness:**
   - Start at any node, attempt to BFS color the graph and count the number of colors needed. Repeat for unvisited components if the graph is disconnected.

### Code

```python
from collections import deque, defaultdict

def divide_nodes_into_groups(n, edges):
    # Building the adjacency list for the graph
    adj_list = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        adj_list[u].append(v)
        adj_list[v].append(u)
    
    # To keep track of node colors (or group numbers)
    color = [-1] * (n + 1)
    
    # Function to perform BFS and check if the graph is multi-partite
    def bfs(node):
        queue = deque([node])
        color[node] = 0
        max_color_used = 0
        
        while queue:
            u = queue.popleft()
            for v in adj_list[u]:
                if color[v] == -1:
                    color[v] = color[u] + 1
                    max_color_used = max(max_color_used, color[v])
                    queue.append(v)
                elif color[v] == color[u]:
                    return -1  # This condition makes it non-bipartite
        
        return max_color_used + 1
    
    max_groups = 0
    for node in range(1, n + 1):
        if color[node] == -1:
            groups = bfs(node)
            if groups == -1:
                return -1  # Impossible to partition as no viable solution
            max_groups = max(max_groups, groups)
    
    return max_groups

# Example Usage:
n = 5
edges = [(1, 2), (2, 3), (4, 5)]
print(divide_nodes_into_groups(n, edges))  # Output: 3 since node 4 and 5 form their own group which increases it to 3 groups.
```

### Time Complexity

- **Graph construction:** `O(m)` where `m` is the number of edges.
- **BFS Traversal:** `O(n + m)` for each component of the graph. In the worst case, it will cover all nodes and edges.

So the overall time complexity is `O(n + m)`, which is efficient for the problem constraints.

### Space Complexity

- **Adjacency list:** `O(n + m)`
- **Color array and queue:** `O(n)`

Thus, the space complexity is also `O(n + m)`.
