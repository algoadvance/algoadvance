title:  Shortest Distance After Road Addition Queries II-out
permalink: /s3244
---
You are given a city represented by a bidirectional weighted graph with \( n \) nodes, and you need to handle \( m \) queries of two types:

1. **Query Type 1** (`1 u v`): Find the shortest distance from node `u` to node `v`.
2. **Query Type 2** (`2 u v w`): Add a bidirectional road between nodes `u` and ``v`` with weight `w`.

The graph initially starts with no roads and contains `n` nodes (0-indexed).

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can nodes have self-loops or multiple edges between them? 
2. Can roads be temporarily removed or are all additions permanent?
3. Are there constraints on the maximum number of nodes or the maximum edge weight?
4. Should we assume that all nodes and edges are within valid limits, i.e., `u`, `v` are valid node indices, and `w` is not negative?

### Strategy
To handle the shortest path queries and dynamically add edges, we can use two primary strategies:

1. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: This algorithm computes all pairs shortest paths in \( O(n^3) \) time. Every time a new edge is added, we could potentially rerun the algorithm. While the initial computation is expensive, it simplifies finding the shortest path as each query will be answered in \( O(1) \) time.

2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm + Dynamic Updates**: Given that edge additions require us to recalculate paths dynamically, we can use a more dynamic approach like Dijkstra's algorithm, implemented via an adjacency list and a priority queue. However, dynamic updates make it tricky because Dijkstra's algorithm usually starts from a single source.

We will implement the more straightforward solution using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm since it suits the all-pairs shortest path nature of this problem.

### Time Complexity
- **Floyd-Warshall Precomputation**: \( O(n^3) \) time.
- **Shortest Path Query**: \( O(1) \) time.
- **Edge Addition**: \( O(n^2) \) time, necessary to update shortest paths.

This approach is most practical assuming \( n \) is of moderate size.

### Code Implementation

```python
def process_queries(n, queries):
    # Initialize the graph with infinities for non-existing edges
    INF = float('inf')
    dist = [[INF] * n for _ in range(n)]

    # Distance from a node to itself is 0
    for i in range(n):
        dist[i][i] = 0

    results = []

    for query in queries:
        if query[0] == 1:
            _, u, v = query
            # Return the shortest path distance from u to v
            result = dist[u][v] if dist[u][v] != INF else -1
            results.append(result)
        elif query[0] == 2:
            _, u, v, w = query
            if dist[u][v] > w:
                dist[u][v] = w
                dist[v][u] = w
                # Update the distances using Floyd-Warshall iteration
                for i in range(n):
                    for j in range(n):
                        dist[i][j] = min(dist[i][j], dist[i][u] + w + dist[v][j], dist[i][v] + w + dist[u][j])
    
    return results

# Example use:
n = 5  # Number of nodes
queries = [
    [2, 0, 1, 4],  # Add a road between node 0 and node 1 with weight 4
    [2, 1, 2, 2],  # Add a road between node 1 and node 2 with weight 2
    [2, 2, 3, 3],  # Add a road between node 2 and node 3 with weight 3
    [2, 3, 4, 1],  # Add a road between node 3 and node 4 with weight 1
    [1, 0, 4]      # Find shortest distance from node 0 to node 4
]
print(process_queries(n, queries))  # Output: [10]
```

This code snippet processes the given queries as described. It initializes the distance matrix, handles the dynamic addition of edges, and answers shortest path queries using an incremental approach to maintain all-pairs shortest paths.
