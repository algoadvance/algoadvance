title:  All Nodes Distance K in Binary Tree-out
permalink: /s863
---

We are given the root of a binary tree and a target node, and an integer `K`. We need to return a list of the values of all nodes that have a distance `K` from the target node. The distance between two nodes is the number of edges on the shortest path connecting them.

### Example
Given the tree:
```
      3
     / \
    5   1
   / \ / \
  6  2 0  8
    / \
   7   4
```
Target node = 5 and K = 2

Output: `[7, 4, 1]`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the target node have a distance of 0?**
   Yes, if K is 0, we return the target node itself.

2. **Are all values in the tree unique?**
   Yes, the values of the nodes in the tree are unique.

3. **What should be returned if K is larger than the height of the tree?**
   Return an empty list as there will be no nodes at that distance.

4. **Can the root be null?**
   Yes, if the root is null, we should return an empty list.

5. **What if the target node is not found in the tree?**
   You can assume the input provides a valid target node present in the tree.

## Strategy

1. **Convert the Tree into a Graph**:
   First, convert the binary tree into an undirected graph representation. This allows us to naturally handle the distances using BFS.

2. **BFS Traversal**:
   Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from the target node to find all nodes that are at distance `K`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle when K is 0 by returning the target node as the only element in the list.
   - If the root is null, return an empty list immediately.

## Code
```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque
from typing import List, Optional

# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def distanceK(root: Optional[TreeNode], target: TreeNode, K: int) -> List[int]:
    if not root:
        return []
    
    # Build graph from tree
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    
    def build_graph(node, parent=None):
        if node and parent:
            graph[node.val].append(parent.val)
            graph[parent.val].append(node.val)
        if node.left:
            build_graph(node.left, node)
        if node.right:
            build_graph(node.right, node)
    
    build_graph(root)
    
    # Perform BFS from the target node
    queue = deque([(target.val, 0)])
    seen = set([target.val])
    result = []
    
    while queue:
        node, dist = queue.popleft()
        if dist == K:
            result.append(node)
        elif dist < K:
            for neighbor in graph[node]:
                if neighbor not in seen:
                    seen.add(neighbor)
                    queue.append((neighbor, dist + 1))
    
    return result
```

## Time Complexity

**Building the graph:** Each node is visited once, and the edges are created for each connection. This takes `O(N)` time, where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree.

**BFS Traversal:** In the worst case, we visit every node and every edge, which takes `O(N)` time.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(N)`.

**Space Complexity:** The space required for storing the graph takes `O(N)` space. Additionally, the BFS queue and `seen` set will also take up `O(N)` space in the worst case. Thus, the overall space complexity is `O(N)`.
