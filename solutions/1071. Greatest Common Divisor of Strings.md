Leetcode 1071 - **Greatest Common Divisor of Strings**

Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, return the largest string `x` such that `x` divides both `str1` and `str2`.

A string `x` divides string `y` if and only if `y` is equal to `x` concatenated some number of times. For example, "abc" divides "abcabc" but not "abca".

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the input format?**
   - The inputs are two non-empty strings `str1` and `str2`.

2. **What is the output?**
   - The output is the greatest common divisor string `x` which is the largest string that can divide both `str1` and `str2`.

3. **Are there any constraints on the length of the input strings?**
   - No specific constraints are mentioned, but typical constraints for such problems apply (e.g., 1 <= len(str1), len(str2) <= 1000).

### Strategy
To solve this problem:
1. **GCD Approach:** The idea is inspired by the mathematical GCD (Greatest Common Divisor).
   - If a string `x` divides both `str1` and `str2`, then it must also divide their concatenations in any order, i.e., `x` should divide both `str1 + str2` and `str2 + str1`.
   - Thus, the first thing to check is if `str1 + str2 == str2 + str1`. If not, return an empty string as there's no common divisor.
   - If they are a match, the length of the GCD string should be `gcd(len(str1), len(str2))`.
2. **Helper Functions:** We will create helper functions to:
   - Compute the GCD of two numbers.
   - Use the GCD length to extract the divisor substring from any of the input strings and return it.

### Code

```python
import math

def gcd_of_strings(str1, str2):
    # Check if str1 + str2 is equal to str2 + str1
    if str1 + str2 != str2 + str1:
        return ""

    # Find the GCD of the lengths of str1 and str2
    gcd_length = math.gcd(len(str1), len(str2))
    
    # The GCD string is the substring of str1 from 0 to gcd_length
    return str1[:gcd_length]

# Example Usage
str1 = "ABCABC"
str2 = "ABC"
print(gcd_of_strings(str1, str2))  # Output: "ABC"
```

### Time Complexity
- **Concatenation Check:** The time complexity to check `str1 + str2 == str2 + str1` is \(O(len(str1) + len(str2))\).
- **GCD Calculation:** The GCD of the lengths is computed in constant time because it uses the Euclidean algorithm, \(O(log(\min(len1, len2)))\).
- **Substring Extraction:** Extracting the substring is \(O(gcd(len(str1), len(str2)))\).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(len(str1) + len(str2))\).
