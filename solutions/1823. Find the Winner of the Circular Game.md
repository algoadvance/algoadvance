LeetCode 1823: **Find the Winner of the Circular Game**

There are `n` friends that are playing a game. The friends are sitting in a circle and are numbered from `1` to `n` in a clockwise direction. More formally, moving clockwise from the `i-th` friend brings you to the `(i+1)-th` friend for `1 <= i < n`, and moving clockwise from the `n-th` friend brings you to the `1-st` friend.

The rules of the game are as follows:
1. Start at the `1-st` friend.
2. Count the next `k` friends (including the friend you started at) and eliminate the `k-th` friend.
3. Go to the next friend clockwise and repeat the process until only one friend remains.

Given the number of friends `n` and an integer `k`, return the number of the last remaining friend.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints:**
   - Is it guaranteed that `n` and `k` are positive integers?
   - What are the maximum values for `n` and `k`?

2. **Input Format:**
   - Will the input always be valid (i.e., always two integers)?

3. **Output Format:**
   - Should the function return a single integer, representing the last remaining friend's number?

Let's assume the following based on typical LeetCode constraints:
- `1 <= n, k <= 500`.

## Code

```python
def findTheWinner(n: int, k: int) -> int:
    # List of friends numbered from 1 to n
    friends = list(range(1, n + 1))
    
    # Start eliminating friends
    elim_index = 0
    
    while len(friends) > 1:
        # Find the kth friend to eliminate
        elim_index = (elim_index + k - 1) % len(friends)
        # Eliminate the friend
        friends.pop(elim_index)
    
    return friends[0]

# Example Usage:
# n = 5, k = 2
# Output: 3
print(findTheWinner(5,2))
```

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a list of friends numbered from `1` to `n`.

2. **Elimination Process**:
   - Use the modulo operation to find the correct index of the friend to be eliminated in each step. This is crucial to handle the circular nature of the game.
   - Keep eliminating the `k-th` friend until only one friend remains.

3. **Return the Last Friend**:
   - Once the list is reduced to a single friend, return it.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is `O(n*k)` in the worst case due to repetitive list removals which take `O(n)` in worst cases since every removal implies shifting elements to fill the gap. However, the modulo arithmetic itself is `O(1)`.

This can be further optimized using mathematical solutions (Josephus problem), but it may complicate the problem beyond simple iterative logic.
