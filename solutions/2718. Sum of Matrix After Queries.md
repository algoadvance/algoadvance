title:  Sum of Matrix After Queries-out
permalink: /s2718
---

You are given an integer `n` representing the size of an `nxn` matrix and a 2D integer array `queries`, where each `queries[i] = [type, index, val]`. The `type` represents the type of query:

1. `0` represents updating all the elements in row `index` to `val`.
2. `1` represents updating all the elements in column `index` to `val`.

Return the sum of all integers in the matrix after processing all the queries.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the queries overlap in terms of rows and columns?**
   - Yes, multiple queries can affect the same row or column.

2. **What is the range of values for `n` and the elements in `queries`?**
   - Typically, input constraints in such problems are given. Assume they fit within typical competitive programming constraints (e.g., `1 <= n <= 1000` and reasonable constraints on query size).

3. **Should the initial matrix be zero-initialized or contain undefined values?**
   - The problem typically implies a zero-initialized matrix.

4. **Can we have repeated row and column operations?**
   - Yes, you can. The latest operation on a row or column is what counts before the sum calculation.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Start with an `nxn` matrix initialized with zeros.
2. **Simple Update**: For each query of the form `[0, index, val]`, update the entire row at `index` to `val`. For each query of the form `[1, index, val]`, update the entire column at `index` to `val`.
3. **Efficient Storage**:
   - Directly updating the matrix for each query is inefficient (O(n^2) for each update).
   - Instead, keep track of the latest row and column updates using dictionaries. After all queries are processed, compute the matrix values and their sum.
   
### Code

Here's how we can implement the above strategy in Python:

```python
def matrixSumQueries(n, queries):
    # Track the latest updates for rows and columns
    row_updates = {}
    column_updates = {}

    # Process each query
    for query in queries:
        query_type, index, val = query
        
        if query_type == 0:
            # Update row
            row_updates[index] = val
        else:
            # Update column
            column_updates[index] = val

    # Initialize matrix sum
    total_sum = 0

    # Calculate the sum after applying row and column updates
    # Start by adding the rows affected with the latest row value
    for row_index in row_updates:
        # The entire row is set to the row value update
        total_sum += row_updates[row_index] * n

    # Create a set for columns fully accounted by row_updates to avoid double counting
    fully_accounted_columns = set()
    for row_index in row_updates:
        fully_accounted_columns.update(range(n))
    
    # Adjust for column updates
    for col_index in column_updates:
        # Calculate the effective cells updated in non-updated rows
        for row_index in range(n):
            if row_index not in row_updates:
                total_sum += column_updates[col_index]
            elif row_index in fully_accounted_columns:
                total_sum += column_updates[col_index]
                fully_accounted_columns.remove(row_index)
    
    return total_sum

# Example usage
n = 3
queries = [[0, 1, 100], [1, 0, 100], [1, 2, 200], [1, 2, 300], [0, 0, 50]]
print(matrixSumQueries(n, queries))  # Output should be calculated correctly
```

### Time Complexity

- The space complexity for the dictionaries `row_updates` and `column_updates` is O(n) each, leading to O(2n) which simplifies to O(n).
- Looping through `queries` is O(m) where `m` is the number of queries.
- The final calculation step involves a linear pass over the updates, so it remains efficient at O(n).

Thus, the time complexity is O(m + n), which is manageable given typical problem constraints.
