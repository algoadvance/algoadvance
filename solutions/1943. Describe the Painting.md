title:  Describe the Painting-out
permalink: /s1943
---
You are given a 2D list of `segments`, where each `segments[i] = [start[i], end[i], color[i]]` represents a segment of a painting that starts at `start[i]`, ends at `end[i]`, and is painted with the color `color[i]`.

The problem requires outputting a list `results`, where each element in the `results` list is a triplet `[start, end, color]`, representing a segment of the painting where `start` and `end` are the start and end points of the segment, and `color` is the color of the segment. The segments in the output should be as fine-grained as possible, meaning that you should not have any overlapping segments and any continuous segments with the same color should only appear once.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Do the input segments have to be in sorted order?
2. Can segments overlap or be adjacent to one another in the input list?
3. How should the solution handle cases where the input list is empty or contains only a single segment?

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we should use a sweep line algorithm to manage overlapping intervals effectively:
1. Create an event list from the segment start and end points.
2. Sort the events in ascending order.
3. Use a dictionary to store the active intervals and their corresponding colors.
4. Iterate over the sorted events, updating the active intervals.
5. Merge intervals of the same color to form the final output.

### Steps:
1. Traverse the segments and create events for each segment's start and end.
2. Sort the events.
3. Use a sweep line to keep track of active segments and merge intervals with the same color.
4. Construct the `results` list based on the processed intervals.

## Code
```python
from collections import defaultdict
from sortedcontainers import SortedDict

def describePainting(segments):
    events = []
    
    # Create start and end events
    for start, end, color in segments:
        events.append((start, color))
        events.append((end, -color))
    
    # Sort events by position
    events.sort()
    
    active_colors = SortedDict()
    prev_position = None
    current_color_sum = 0
    result = []
    
    # Sweep line over the events
    for pos, color in events:
        if prev_position is not None and pos != prev_position and current_color_sum:
            result.append([prev_position, pos, current_color_sum])
        
        # Update the active_colors dictionary
        if color > 0:
            if color in active_colors:
                active_colors[color] += 1
            else:
                active_colors[color] = 1
        else:
            if active_colors[-color] == 1:
                del active_colors[-color]
            else:
                active_colors[-color] -= 1
        
        # Compute current_color_sum
        current_color_sum = sum(active_colors.keys())
        prev_position = pos
    
    return result

# Test case
segments = [[1, 4, 5], [4, 7, 7], [1, 7, 6]]
print(describePainting(segments))  # Expected: [[1, 4, 11], [4, 7, 13]]
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Sorting the events**: O(n log n), where n is the total number of events (twice the number of segments).
2. **Iterating through the events and updating active segment data**: O(n).

Overall time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting step.
