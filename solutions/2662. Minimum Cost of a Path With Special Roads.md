title:  Minimum Cost of a Path With Special Roads-out
permalink: /s2662
---

Given a grid of size \( n \times n \) and an array of special roads with their costs, determine the minimum cost to travel from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner of the grid. You can either move to adjacent cells with a cost of 1 or use one of the special roads.

**Input:**

- **\( n \)**: the size of the grid (an integer).
- **Array of special roads**: each element is a tuple \((x_1, y_1, x_2, y_2, c)\) where:
  - \( (x_1, y_1) \) is the starting point of the special road.
  - \( (x_2, y_2) \) is the ending point of the special road.
  - \( c \) is the cost of using this special road.

**Output:**

- An integer representing the minimum cost to travel from \( (0, 0) \) to \( (n-1, n-1) \).

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use Dijkstra's Algorithm since this problem is a shortest path problem on a graph where the nodes are the cells of the grid, and the edges represent the possible movements and special roads.

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Cells of the grid can be treated as nodes.
   - Edges between the nodes have a weight of 1 for adjacent cells.
   - Special roads add weighted edges between specific pairs of nodes.

2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**:
   - We will use a priority queue to always expand the least costly path first.
   - Initialize the cost to reach each cell with infinity, and set the cost of the starting cell (0,0) to 0.
   - Expand each node by considering moves to adjacent cells and using special roads.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Use a priority queue (min-heap).
   - Maintain a dictionary to keep track of the minimum cost to reach each cell.

## Code

```python
import heapq

def minimumCost(n, special_roads):
    # Directions for moving to adjacent cells: right, down, left, up
    directions = [(1, 0), (0, 1), (-1, 0), (0, -1)]
    
    # Priority queue for Dijkstra's Algorithm
    pq = [(0, 0, 0)]  # (cost, x, y)
    # Dictionary to store the minimum cost to reach each cell
    min_cost = {(0, 0): 0}
    
    while pq:
        cost, x, y = heapq.heappop(pq)
        
        # If we reach the bottom-right corner, return the cost
        if (x, y) == (n-1, n-1):
            return cost
        
        # Check all possible moves to adjacent cells
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < n and 0 <= ny < n:
                new_cost = cost + 1
                if (nx, ny) not in min_cost or new_cost < min_cost[(nx, ny)]:
                    min_cost[(nx, ny)] = new_cost
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (new_cost, nx, ny))
        
        # Check all special roads
        for (x1, y1, x2, y2, c) in special_roads:
            if (x, y) == (x1, y1):
                if (x2, y2) not in min_cost or cost + c < min_cost[(x2, y2)]:
                    min_cost[(x2, y2)] = cost + c
                    heapq.heappush(pq, (cost + c, x2, y2))
                    
    # If we exit the loop without having reached (n-1, n-1), return inf as indicatiÃ³n of no path found
    return float('inf')

# Example usage:
n = 5
special_roads = [
    (0, 0, 2, 2, 5),
    (1, 1, 3, 3, 2),
    (3, 0, 4, 4, 7)
]
print(minimumCost(n, special_roads))  # Output could vary based on example input
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: The priority queue and the cost dictionary are initialized with a single element, which takes \( O(1) \).
- **Main Loop**: In the worst case, each of the \( n^2 \) cells is inserted into the priority queue. Each insertion or extraction from the priority queue takes \( O(\log(n^2)) = O(\log n) \).
- **Special Roads**: Each road is checked for every position, so the time complexity of checking the special roads is \( O(k) \), where \( k \) is the number of special roads.

Overall, the time complexity is \( O((n^2 + k) \log n) \), which should be efficient for moderate values of \( n \) and \( k \).
