title:  Selling Pieces of Wood-out
permalink: /s2312
---

You are given a rectangular piece of wood with dimensions `m x n`. You want to sell this piece of wood by cutting it into smaller rectangular pieces and selling each piece. Each piece of wood has a price associated with it based on its dimensions.

Given a list of prices where `prices[i] = [height, width, price]`, write a function that calculates the maximum profit you can achieve by cutting the original wood piece optimally.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume that prices are given for all possible sub-rectangles of the wood piece?
2. Are the dimensions in the `prices` list always within the range of the provided wood piece `m x n`?
3. Can a sub-rectangle have the same dimensions but be sold at different prices?
4. Are we allowed to rotate pieces to match the given prices?

### Example

```
Input: 
m = 4, n = 4
prices = [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 5], [2, 2, 8], [3, 3, 10], [2, 1, 2]]

Output: 
maxProfit(4, 4, prices) => 16
```

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Define a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum profit for a piece of wood with dimensions `i x j`.
   - Initialize `dp[i][j]` to 0 for all `i` and `j`.
   - Populate the DP table using the given prices.
   - Iterate through all possible cuts, either vertically or horizontally, and update the DP table accordingly.
   - The answer will be in `dp[m][n]`.

2. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - For each price given, directly fill in the DP table.
   - For each dimension `i x j`, consider all horizontal cuts and vertical cuts:
     - Horizontal cut: `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[k][j] + dp[i-k][j])` for all `k < i`
     - Vertical cut: `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[i][j-k])` for all `k < j`

### Time Complexity

- The solution involves filling a DP table of size `m x n` and for each cell, considering all possible cuts, which results in a complexity of `O(m^2 * n + m * n^2)`, simplifying to `O(m^2 * n^2)` in the worst case.

### Code

```python
def maxProfit(m, n, prices):
    # Create DP table initialized to 0
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    
    # Fill DP array with the given prices
    for height, width, price in prices:
        dp[height][width] = price
    
    # Populate DP table
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            # Max profit by making horizontal cuts
            for k in range(1, i):
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[k][j] + dp[i - k][j])
            # Max profit by making vertical cuts
            for k in range(1, j):
                dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[i][j - k])
    
    return dp[m][n]

# Example usage:
m = 4
n = 4
prices = [[1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 5], [2, 2, 8], [3, 3, 10], [2, 1, 2]]
print(maxProfit(m, n, prices))  # Output: 16
```

This approach ensures that we consider all possible ways to cut the wood to maximize profit while leveraging the provided prices efficiently within a feasible performance limit.
