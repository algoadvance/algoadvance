title:  Lexicographically Smallest Beautiful String-out
permalink: /s2663
---
You are given a string `p` representing a non-empty lexicographically smallest beautiful string. A beautiful string is a string where there are no three consecutive characters the same and no two consecutive characters the same. You need to return the lexicographically smallest beautiful string that is strictly larger than `p`. If there is no such beautiful string, return an empty string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the length of the string `p`?**
   - This is important to understand if the algorithm needs special handling for very large inputs.

2. **What characters are allowed in the string `p`?**
   - This helps to know if it's limited to lowercase English letters or other character sets.

3. **How is the input `p` validated?**
   - To know if preprocessing checks are needed on the input string.

### Strategy
1. Start from the end of the string and attempt to increment the character.
2. Ensure that after incrementing, the string remains beautiful by checking the character constraints (no two or three consecutive characters are the same).
3. If the incremented string is valid, return it; otherwise, continue the process.
4. If the entire string is traversed and no valid string is found, return an empty string.

### Code

Here's a Python implementation of the strategy:

```python
def next_beautiful_string(p):
    n = len(p)
    if n == 0:
        return ""
    
    def is_beautiful(s):
        for i in range(1, len(s)):
            if s[i] == s[i-1]:
                return False
        for i in range(2, len(s)):
            if s[i] == s[i-1] == s[i-2]:
                return False
        return True

    p = list(p)
    
    for i in range(n - 1, -1, -1):
        for j in range(ord(p[i]) + 1, ord('z') + 1):
            p[i] = chr(j)
            if i > 0 and p[i] == p[i - 1]:
                continue
            if i > 1 and p[i] == p[i - 1] == p[i - 2]:
                continue

            for x in range(i + 1, n):
                for y in range(ord('a'), ord('z') + 1):
                    p[x] = chr(y)
                    if (x > 0 and p[x] == p[x - 1]) or (x > 1 and p[x] == p[x - 1] == p[x - 2]):
                        continue
                    if is_beautiful(p):
                        return "".join(p)
    return ""

# Example Usage:
p = "abcz"
print(next_beautiful_string(p))  # Output will be the next lexicographically smallest beautiful string after "abcz"
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach in the worst case is O(n * 26 * n * 26), which simplifies to O(n^2). This accounts for the need to try to increment the string character by character from the end and verify the validity, up to a maximum of 26 possibilities per character position in the string.

This solution ensures every step adheres to the constraints of not having consecutive characters being the same, providing the correct output accordingly.
