title:  Distribute Coins in Binary Tree-out
permalink: /s979
---

You are given the root of a binary tree with `N` nodes where each node in the tree has a certain number of coins. There are `N` coins total. In one move, we may choose two adjacent nodes and move one coin from one node to the other. (A move may be from parent to child, or from child to parent.)

Return the number of moves required to make every node have exactly one coin.

#### Example:
```plaintext
Input: [3,0,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: From the root of the tree, we move one coin to its left child, and one coin to its right child.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can there be negative values or non-integer values in the tree nodes?**
    - No, each node will only contain a non-negative integer number of coins.
  
2. **What constitutes a single move?**
    - Moving a coin from one node to its direct connected node (its parent or its child).

3. **Are there any constraints on the size of the tree?**
    - The problem does not specify constraints on tree size, but since it is a binary tree, configurations with up to 1000 nodes are common.

### Strategy

1. **Post-order Traversal**:
    - We will use a post-order traversal of the tree (left-right-root) to handle coin distribution.
    - At each node, we calculate the number of excess coins it has (coins - 1). 
        - Positive excess means the node has more coins than it needs.
        - Negative excess means the node needs more coins than it currently has.
    - We propagate this excess to the parent node.
    
2. **Accumulate Moves**:
    - Maintain a counter to accumulate the number of moves required as we redistribute the coins through the tree.

### Code

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def distributeCoins(root):
    def dfs(node):
        if not node:
            return 0
        left_excess = dfs(node.left)
        right_excess = dfs(node.right)
        total_excess = left_excess + right_excess + node.val - 1
        self.moves += abs(total_excess)
        return total_excess

    self.moves = 0
    dfs(root)
    return self.moves

# Example usage:
# root = TreeNode(3, TreeNode(0), TreeNode(0))
# print(distributeCoins(root))  # Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the tree.
- We perform a single DFS traversal of the tree, and during that traversal, we perform constant time operations at each node.
- Hence, the total time complexity remains linear in terms of the number of nodes.
