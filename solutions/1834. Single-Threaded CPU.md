Given `n` tasks, where each task is represented by an array `tasks`, with task `[i] = [enqueueTime_i, processingTime_i]`, you must schedule the tasks on a single-threaded CPU. The CPU can only process one task at a time and will be free once it finishes the processing of the current task.

You need to return the order of the tasks that the CPU will process them. If two tasks have the same `enqueueTime` and `processingTime`, they should be processed in the order of their original indexes.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Is the length of `tasks` guaranteed to be at least 1?
   - What are the ranges for `enqueueTime_i` and `processingTime_i`?

2. **Output Format:**
   - Should the order of tasks be represented by their original indices in the order they are processed by the CPU?

### Strategy

1. **Read and Index the Tasks:**
   - Create a list of tasks with their original indices.
   
2. **Sort Tasks by Enqueue Time:**
   - Sort the tasks by `enqueueTime` primarily, and use the original index as a tie-breaker.

3. **Use a Priority Queue (Min-Heap):**
   - As we iterate through the tasks based on their enqueue time, we push tasks into a min-heap based on their `processingTime`. If `processingTime` is the same, use the original index to maintain order.

4. **Simulate CPU Processing:**
   - Use a simulated current time, and pop tasks from the heap to process them, incrementing the time by their `processingTime`.

5. **Collect Processed Task Order:**
   - Maintain an ordered list of the indices of the tasks as they are processed.

### Code

Here is the Python code implementing the above strategy:

```python
import heapq

def getOrder(tasks):
    # Add the original indices to the tasks
    tasks_with_index = [(enqueue, process, i) for i, (enqueue, process) in enumerate(tasks)]
    
    # Sort tasks by enqueue time, and by index if equal enqueue time
    tasks_with_index.sort(key=lambda x: (x[0], x[2]))
    
    # Use a min-heap to process tasks by processing time and then by index
    heap = []
    current_time = 0
    result = []
    i = 0
    n = len(tasks)
    
    while i < n or heap:
        # If no tasks in heap, fast-forward time to enqueue time of next task
        if not heap and current_time < tasks_with_index[i][0]:
            current_time = tasks_with_index[i][0]
        
        # Push all tasks with enqueue time <= current_time into the heap
        while i < n and tasks_with_index[i][0] <= current_time:
            heapq.heappush(heap, (tasks_with_index[i][1], tasks_with_index[i][2]))
            i += 1
        
        # Pop the task with the smallest processing time (and smallest index on tie)
        if heap:
            processing_time, index = heapq.heappop(heap)
            current_time += processing_time
            result.append(index)
    
    return result
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** The initial sorting of tasks takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Heap Operations:** In the worst case, every task is pushed and popped from the heap exactly once, leading to \(O(n \log n)\) for the heap operations.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is \(O(n \log n)\).

### Explanation

1. **Task Indexing:** Combine each task's enqueue time and processing time with its original index.
2. **Sorting:** Initial sort ensures tasks are in the correct order for processing.
3. **Heap Management:** Min-heap allows efficiently selecting the next task based on the smallest processing time.
4. **Time Simulation:** Maintain a `current_time` and increment it as tasks are processed, ensuring the correct order of execution.

This approach ensures we efficiently manage the CPU scheduling while respecting the constraints and conditions provided.
