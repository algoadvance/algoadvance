title:  Tallest Billboard-out

---

You are installing a billboard and want it to have the largest height. The billboard will have two steel supports, and you can choose them from a collection. The challenge is to find the maximum possible height you can achieve for both supports, ensuring they are of the same height.

You have an array of `rods` where each element represents the length of a rod you can use. Return the maximum height of the billboard supports that can be equal, or 0 if it cannot be done.

You cannot cut any of the rods but can place them on either support.

**Example:**

1. Input: `rods = [1, 2, 3, 6]`
   Output: `6`
   
2. Input: `rods = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`
   Output: `10`
   
3. Input: `rods = [1, 2]`
   Output: `0`

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= rods.length <= 20`
- `1 <= rods[i] <= 1000`
- The sum of `rods` is at most `5000`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can we ignore rods if they can't contribute to equalizing heights?
2. Are negative heights valid if that helps balance?

## Strategy

We use dynamic programming (DP) to solve this problem. The idea is to maintain a dictionary `dp` where the key is the difference in height between the two supports and the value is the maximum sum of supports' heights that gives this difference.

- Initialize `dp` with `{0: 0}` indicating the difference of 0 can be achieved with height 0.
- For each rod, update the dp dictionary by adding the rod to either support, or not including the rod, checking the possible state changes.

Here's the step-by-step plan:

1. Iterate through each rod.
2. For each rod, iterate through the existing states in `dp` and update new possible states:
   - Add the rod to the first support.
   - Add the rod to the second support.
   - Ignore the rod.
3. After processing all rods, `dp[0]` will have the maximum height where both supports are equal.

## Code

```python
def tallestBillboard(rods):
    dp = {0: 0}
    for rod in rods:
        current = dp.copy()
        for diff, height in current.items():
            dp[diff + rod] = max(dp.get(diff + rod, 0), height)
            dp[abs(diff - rod)] = max(dp.get(abs(diff - rod), 0), height + min(diff, rod))
    return dp[0]

# Example usage:
print(tallestBillboard([1, 2, 3, 6]))  # Output: 6
print(tallestBillboard([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]))  # Output: 10
print(tallestBillboard([1, 2]))  # Output: 0
```

## Time Complexity

The solution involves iterating through each rod and updating the `dp` dictionary. Since the total sum of rods is limited to 5000:

- Each update on `dp` depends on the maximum sum.
- For each rod, we make updates for linear states.

Hence, the overall time complexity is roughly `O(n * S)`, with `n` being the number of rods and `S` the sum of rods, which is reasonably efficient for the problem's constraints.
