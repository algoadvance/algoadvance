title:  Rearrange Words in a Sentence-out
permalink: /s1451
---

The problem requires us to rearrange the words in a sentence based on the length of each word. We need to return the rearranged sentence such that:

1. The first word of the output sentence should start with a capital letter.
2. The rest of the words should be in lowercase.
3. The sentence should be returned where the words are sorted by their lengths. If two words have the same length, they should remain in the order they appeared in the original sentence.

**Example:**
```
Input: "Leetcode is cool"
Output: "Is cool leetcode"
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What is the range of input sizes we need to handle?
   **A:** The input size can vary, but typically it will be within the constraints to fit within memory limits of a standard input (1 ≤ input size ≤ 10^5 characters).

2. **Q:** Will punctuation marks be included in the input?
   **A:** No, the input will be a simple sentence without any punctuation marks, only alphabets and spaces.

3. **Q:** How should we handle multiple spaces between words?
   **A:** It is assumed that the input will contain a single space between words. There will not be multiple consecutive spaces.

4. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the character casing in the input?
   **A:** The input sentence will always start with a capital letter and the rest will be in lowercase, as it's meant to be proper English sentences.

## Strategy

1. **Split the sentence into words.** This can be achieved using Python’s `split()` method which splits based on whitespace by default.
2. **Sort the words by their length** while maintaining their relative order if they are of the same length. Python's `sorted()` function along with `key=len` will be handy for this.
3. **Capitalize the first word and lower the rest.** After sorting, capitalize the first word of the resultant list and ensure the rest of the words are in lowercase.
4. **Join the words back into a sentence.** Use `join()` to construct the final sentence from the list of words.

## Code

```python
def arrangeWords(text: str) -> str:
    # Split the sentence into words
    words = text.split()
    # Sort words by length, stable sort keeps the relative order of equal length words
    sorted_words = sorted(words, key=len)
    
    # Capitalize the first word and lowercase the rest
    sorted_words[0] = sorted_words[0].capitalize()
    for i in range(1, len(sorted_words)):
        sorted_words[i] = sorted_words[i].lower()
    
    # Join the words back into a sentence
    result = ' '.join(sorted_words)
    return result

# Test case
print(arrangeWords("Leetcode is cool"))  # Output should be "Is cool leetcode"
```

## Time Complexity

- **Splitting the Sentence:** This operation runs in O(n), where n is the number of characters in the input sentence.
- **Sorting the Words:** Sorting the list of words (assuming there are k words) will take O(k log k).
- **Rearranging and Joining:** This also runs in O(n) since it involves processing each character exactly once in the worst case.

Hence, the overall time complexity is O(n log k), where n is the length of the sentence and k is the number of words in the sentence. Given that k <= n, this is generally manageable within standard limits for input size.
