title:  Minimum Total Cost to Make Arrays Unequal-out
permalink: /s2499
---

You're given two arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, both of them have the same length `n`. The goal is to make these two arrays unequal by modifying the elements of `nums2` as minimal cost, where the cost to modify a single element `nums2[i]` is `abs(nums1[i] - nums2[i])`.

The output should be the minimum total cost to make `nums1` and `nums2` unequal.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What are the constraints on the size of the arrays? 
2. Are there negative numbers in the arrays, and what's the range of their values?
3. Are there any edge cases we should consider, such as both arrays initially being unequal?

Let me proceed assuming some general constraints and common scenarios:

- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- Elements within `nums1` and `nums2` range from `0 to 10^9`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we'll use the following strategy:

1. Iterate through both arrays and check if at any index `i`, `nums1[i]` equals `nums2[i]`.
2. If both values are unequal at all indices initially, return `0` since no modification is needed.
3. If they are equal at some indices, we need to calculate the cost of changing the elements in `nums2` to make them unequal:
   - We would ideally change `nums2[i]` to a value that is different from `nums1[i]`.
   
We need to keep track of the total cost required to change all equal elements and evaluate if a direct change at each index could lead to the minimal cost.

### Code

Here's a Python implementation of the above strategy:

```python
def minimumTotalCost(nums1, nums2):
    n = len(nums1)
    total_cost = 0
    
    for i in range(n):
        if nums1[i] == nums2[i]:
            # Change nums2[i] to some different value, optimal would be the minimum cost
            new_value = (nums2[i] + 1) if nums2[i] != (nums1[i] + 1) else (nums2[i] - 1)
            cost = abs(nums1[i] - new_value)
            total_cost += cost
            # Change nums2[i] to ensure they are unequal
            nums2[i] = new_value
    
    return total_cost

# Example Usage:
nums1 = [1, 2, 3]
nums2 = [4, 2, 3]
print(minimumTotalCost(nums1, nums2))  # Output should be the minimum cost to make arrays unequal
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the arrays since we iterate through the arrays only once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

By the end of this approach, you should have a solution that checks elements of both arrays and applies minimum changes to `nums2` to ensure both arrays are unequal at every index with minimal total cost.
