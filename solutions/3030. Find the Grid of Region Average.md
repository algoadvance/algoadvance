title:  Find the Grid of Region Average-out
permalink: /s3030
---

You are given a 2D integer matrix `grid` of size `m x n` and an integer `k`. You need to find a new `m x n` matrix `result` where each cell `(i, j)` of the `result` matrix is the average of all integers in the region `grid[i-k:i+k+1][j-k:j+k+1]`. Values outside the boundary of `grid` are considered as zero.

For instance:
```
grid = [
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9]
]
k = 1
```
The resulting `result` matrix might look like this:
```
result = [
  [3, 3, 2],
  [4, 4, 3],
  [3, 3, 2]
]
```
Note: The integer result should be the floor of the actual average.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Boundary Conditions and Constraints:**
   - What should we assume about the values of `m` and `n`?
   - Is there a constraint on the value of `k`? (e.g., `k` can be larger than `min(m, n)`?)

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - How should we handle cases where `k` is larger than the dimensions of the matrix?
   - What should be done if the grid is empty or if `k` is zero?

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to iterate over each cell `(i, j)` of the `grid`. For each cell, we'll determine the region centered at `(i, j)` with size `(2k + 1) x (2k + 1)`. We'll then calculate the average of the elements within this region, considering grid boundaries and treating out-of-bound areas as zeros.

Steps:
1. Iterate over each cell `(i, j)` in the `grid`.
2. For each cell, determine the bounds of the surrounding region.
3. Compute the sum of values in this region, considering out-of-bound indices as zeros.
4. Calculate the floor value of the average and assign it to the `result` matrix.
5. Return the `result` matrix.

## Code

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
def regionAverage(grid, k):
    import math

    m = len(grid)
    n = len(grid[0]) if grid else 0
    result = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            # Calculate sum for the region grid[i-k:i+k+1][j-k:j+k+1]
            sum_val = 0
            count = 0
            for a in range(i - k, i + k + 1):
                for b in range(j - k, j + k + 1):
                    if 0 <= a < m and 0 <= b < n:
                        sum_val += grid[a][b]
                        count += 1

            if count > 0:
                result[i][j] = math.floor(sum_val / count)
            else:
                result[i][j] = 0
    
    return result

# Example usage:
grid = [
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9]
]
k = 1
print(regionAverage(grid, k))
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this approach is `O(m * n * (2k + 1) * (2k + 1))` where `m` and `n` are the dimensions of the grid. This is because we are iterating over each element and for each element, we are performing a nested iteration over a region of size `(2k + 1) x (2k + 1)`.

- If `k` is small or constant, the complexity can be approximated to `O(m * n)`.
- If `k` is large (approaching the size of `m` or `n`), the complexity could be significant.

Given the input constraints could lead to performance concerns, optimization techniques such as prefix sums could be considered, but this basic approach illustrates the main logic clearly.
