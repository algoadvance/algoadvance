title:  Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee-out
permalink: /s714
---
The problem is to determine the maximum profit you can achieve from trading a stock, given a transaction fee. Specifically:

- You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i-th` day.
- You can complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).
- However, you must pay a transaction fee for each transaction.
- Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

The goal is to maximize your profit.

Here is the function signature:

```python
def maxProfit(prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Types and constraints**: What are the constraints on the size of the `prices` array, and the values of the prices and the fee?
   - Typically, 1 <= `prices.length` <= 10^5
   - 1 <= `prices[i]`, `fee` <= 10^4
2. **Edge Cases**: What should be the output when there are no prices or when trading is not feasible (e.g., all prices are the same)?

## Strategy
We will use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem. 

### Key Concepts:
1. **Hold State**: Represents the maximum profit obtainable on day `i` if we hold a stock.
2. **Cash State**: Represents the maximum profit obtainable on day `i` if we do not hold a stock (i.e., we are in "cash").

Let's initialize two arrays:
- `hold[i]`: Maximum profit on day `i` if we are holding a stock.
- `cash[i]`: Maximum profit on day `i` if we are not holding a stock.

### Recurrence Relations:
- `cash[i] = max(cash[i-1], hold[i-1] + prices[i] - fee)`
  - Maximum of:
    - Not selling the stock (`cash[i-1]`).
    - Selling the stock we are holding (`hold[i-1] + prices[i] - fee`).
    
- `hold[i] = max(hold[i-1], cash[i-1] - prices[i])`
  - Maximum of:
    - Not buying the stock (`hold[i-1]`).
    - Buying the stock (spending `prices[i]` and taking from `cash[i-1]`).
  
### Initialization:
- `cash[0] = 0` (If we do nothing on the first day).
- `hold[0] = -prices[0]` (If we buy the stock on the first day).

### Coding the Solution

```python
def maxProfit(prices, fee):
    n = len(prices)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize the state variables
    cash = [0] * n
    hold = [0] * n
    
    # Initialize the first day states
    cash[0] = 0
    hold[0] = -prices[0]
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        # Calculate cash and hold states for day i
        cash[i] = max(cash[i-1], hold[i-1] + prices[i] - fee)
        hold[i] = max(hold[i-1], cash[i-1] - prices[i])
    
    # The maximum profit on the last day without holding a stock
    return cash[-1]
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of the solution is `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the `prices` array, as we iterate through the array once.
- The space complexity can be optimized to `O(1)` since we only need to keep track of the current and previous states.

We can implement space optimization as follows:

```python
def maxProfit(prices, fee):
    n = len(prices)
    if n == 0:
        return 0
    
    # Initialize the state variables for day 0
    cash = 0
    hold = -prices[0]
    
    for i in range(1, n):
        # Calculate today's states and update the variables
        new_cash = max(cash, hold + prices[i] - fee)
        new_hold = max(hold, cash - prices[i])
        
        # Update states
        cash = new_cash
        hold = new_hold
    
    # The maximum profit on the last day without holding a stock
    return cash
```

This final version effectively uses `O(1)` space.
