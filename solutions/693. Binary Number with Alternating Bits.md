title:  Binary Number with Alternating Bits-out
permalink: /s693
---
Given a positive integer `n`, check whether it has alternating bits: namely, if two adjacent bits will always have different values.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of input:** Is there a constraint on how large the integer `n` can be?
   - Assume `n` can be any positive integer within the typical 32-bit signed integer range.
2. **Output format:** Should the output be a boolean indicating whether the integer has alternating bits?
   - Yes, the output should be `True` if the integer has alternating bits, otherwise `False`.

### Strategy
1. **Binary Representation:** Convert the integer `n` to its binary representation.
2. **Alternating Bits Check:**
   - Iterate through the binary string, comparing each bit with the next bit.
   - If any two consecutive bits are the same, return `False`.
   - If the loop completes without finding identical consecutive bits, return `True`.

#### Detailed Steps
1. Convert the integer `n` to a binary string using Python's built-in `bin()` function and strip off the `'0b'` prefix.
2. Loop through the binary string and compare each bit to the next bit.
3. If any bit matches the next bit, return `False`.
4. If the loop completes successfully, return `True`.

### Code

```python
def hasAlternatingBits(n: int) -> bool:
    # Get the binary representation of the number, without the '0b' prefix
    binary_str = bin(n)[2:]
    
    # Loop through the binary string
    for i in range(len(binary_str) - 1):
        # Check if the current bit is the same as the next bit
        if binary_str[i] == binary_str[i + 1]:
            return False
    
    return True

# Example usage:
print(hasAlternatingBits(5))  # True, binary: '101'
print(hasAlternatingBits(7))  # False, binary: '111'
print(hasAlternatingBits(11)) # False, binary: '1011'
print(hasAlternatingBits(10)) # True, binary: '1010'
```

### Time Complexity
- **Conversion to Binary:** The `bin(n)` function has a time complexity of \(O(\log n)\) where \(n\) is the input integer.
- **Loop Through String:** The length of the binary string is \(\log_2 n\), thus the loop also runs in \(O(\log n)\).

The overall time complexity is dominated by these operations and can be considered \(O(\log n)\).
