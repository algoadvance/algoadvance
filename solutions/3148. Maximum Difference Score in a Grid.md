title:  Maximum Difference Score in a Grid-out
permalink: /s3148
---

You are given a `m x n` grid of integers. A path in the grid starts from the top-left cell and ends at the bottom-right cell. You can only move either right or down at any point in time.

The difference score of a path is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum value of the integers on that path.

Return the maximum difference score of any path from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the grid contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the grid can contain any integer values.

2. **What is the size range of the grid?**
   - The grid can be of size `1x1` to `m x n` with `1 <= m, n <= 100`.

3. **Are we only allowed to move either right or down at any point in time?**
   - Yes, the movement is restricted to either right or down.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - We'll use a dynamic programming (DP) approach where we maintain two 2D DP arrays:
     - `max_val[r][c]`: to store the maximum value on the path from the start to cell `(r, c)`.
     - `min_val[r][c]`: to store the minimum value on the path from the start to cell `(r, c)`.
   - Initialize both `max_val` and `min_val` with the value of the starting cell `grid[0][0]`.
   - For each cell `(r, c)`, update `max_val[r][c]` and `min_val[r][c]` considering the maximum and minimum values from either the cell directly above `(r-1, c)` or the cell directly left `(r, c-1)`.
   - The answer will be the maximum difference between `max_val[m-1][n-1]` and `min_val[m-1][n-1]` at the bottom-right cell.

### Code

```python
def max_diff_score(grid):
    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    
    # Initialize DP arrays
    max_val = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    min_val = [[0] * n for _ in range(m)]
    
    max_val[0][0] = grid[0][0]
    min_val[0][0] = grid[0][0]
    
    # Fill the first row and first column
    for r in range(1, m):
        max_val[r][0] = max(max_val[r-1][0], grid[r][0])
        min_val[r][0] = min(min_val[r-1][0], grid[r][0])
        
    for c in range(1, n):
        max_val[0][c] = max(max_val[0][c-1], grid[0][c])
        min_val[0][c] = min(min_val[0][c-1], grid[0][c])
        
    # Fill the rest of the DP table
    for r in range(1, m):
        for c in range(1, n):
            max_val[r][c] = max(max(max_val[r-1][c], max_val[r][c-1]), grid[r][c])
            min_val[r][c] = min(min(min_val[r-1][c], min_val[r][c-1]), grid[r][c])
    
    return max_val[m-1][n-1] - min_val[m-1][n-1]

# Example usage
grid = [
    [8, 4, 7],
    [6, 5, 9]
]
print(max_diff_score(grid))  # Output should be 5
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: O(m * n)
  - Initializing the `max_val` and `min_val` arrays and setting the first row and column values.
- **Dynamic Programming Table Fill**: O(m * n)
  - Filling the DP tables requires scanning each cell once.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(m * n)**, which is efficient enough for the given constraint `1 <= m, n <= 100`. The space complexity is also **O(m * n)** due to the two DP arrays.
