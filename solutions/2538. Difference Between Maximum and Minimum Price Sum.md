title:  Difference Between Maximum and Minimum Price Sum-out
permalink: /s2538
---

You are given a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph with no cycles) with `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and `n - 1` edges.

Each node has a unique value representing the price of that node. Your task is to return the difference between the maximum price sum and the minimum price sum for any path in the tree.

**Inputs:**
- `n`: The number of nodes.
- `edges`: A list of lists where each sublist contains two integers representing the nodes connected by that edge.
- `prices`: A list of integers where each integer represents the price of the corresponding node.

**Output:**
- An integer representing the difference between the maximum and minimum price sum for any path in the tree.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the prices of the nodes always positive integers?
2. Can there be multiple edges between the same pair of nodes?
3. Are there any constraints on the values for `n`, `edges`, and `prices`?

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation:** Represent the tree using an adjacency list.
2. **Tree Traversal:** Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore all possible paths in the tree.
3. **Track Price Sums:** Maintain the current sum of prices for each path.
4. **Max/Min Prices:** Track the maximum and minimum price sums encountered across all paths.

### Time Complexity

Given that we need to traverse all nodes and edges in the tree:
- **Building the adjacency list:** O(n)
- **DFS traversal:** O(n)
So the overall time complexity is O(n).

### Code

```python
from collections import defaultdict

def max_min_price_diff(n, edges, prices):
    def dfs(node, parent):
        max_sum = min_sum = prices[node]
        for neighbor in adj[node]:
            if neighbor != parent:
                sub_min_sum, sub_max_sum = dfs(neighbor, node)
                max_sum = max(max_sum, prices[node] + sub_max_sum)
                min_sum = min(min_sum, prices[node] + sub_min_sum)
        return min_sum, max_sum
    
    # Build the adjacency list for the tree
    adj = defaultdict(list)
    for u, v in edges:
        adj[u].append(v)
        adj[v].append(u)

    # Start DFS from the first node (0 assumed to be the root)
    min_path_sum, max_path_sum = dfs(0, -1)
    
    return max_path_sum - min_path_sum

# Example usage:
n = 5
edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 3], [1, 4]]
prices = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
print(max_min_price_diff(n, edges, prices))  # Example output
```

### Explanation

1. **Graph Construction:** An adjacency list is created from the given edges to represent the tree.
2. **DFS Traversal:** The `dfs` function is defined to explore all nodes from a given starting node. We update the current path sum at each step and keep track of the minimum and maximum price sums encountered during the traversal.
3. **Result Calculation:** The difference between the maximum and minimum price sums found during the DFS traversal is returned.

This approach ensures we cover all paths in the tree and efficiently determine the required max-min difference.
