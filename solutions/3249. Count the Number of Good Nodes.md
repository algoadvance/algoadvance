title:  Count the Number of Good Nodes-out
permalink: /s3249
---

Given a binary tree, a "good" node is defined as a node that is the largest value encountered from the root to that node. We need to write a function that counts the number of good nodes in a binary tree.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **What is the definition of the binary tree node?**
    - A binary tree node typically has a value and pointers to its left and right children.

2. **Is there an upper or a lower limit to the tree's size?**
    - This would help in understanding if there are any specific edge cases with very large trees.

3. **What are the constraints on the node values?**
    - Are the values positive, negative, or can they be any integers?

4. **Is the binary tree necessarily a binary search tree (BST)?**
    - This affects certain traversal particulars, although every node is checked with the root path.

### Strategy:

1. **Traverse the Tree:**
    - We need to traverse the entire tree to examine every node.

2. **Track the Maximum Value:**
    - During traversal, maintain the maximum value encountered so far from the root to the current node.

3. **Count Good Nodes:**
    - For each node, compare its value with the maximal value tracked. If the nodeâ€™s value is at least as large as this maximal value, increment the count of good nodes.

4. **Depth-First Search (DFS):**
    - A DFS approach (either pre-order or in-order) would be useful for this traversal, as it allows accumulating the maximum values along the paths efficiently.

5. **Recursive Implementation:**
    - Use a recursive helper function to perform the DFS traversal, passing along the current maximum value encountered.

### Code:

Here is the Python code to solve this problem:

```python
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def count_good_nodes(root: TreeNode) -> int:
    def dfs(node, max_val):
        if not node:
            return 0
        
        # Count this node if it is a 'good' node
        good_node = 1 if node.val >= max_val else 0
        
        # Update the maximum value seen so far to include this node's value
        max_val = max(max_val, node.val)
        
        # Recursively count 'good' nodes in the left and right subtrees
        good_node += dfs(node.left, max_val)
        good_node += dfs(node.right, max_val)
        
        return good_node
    
    return dfs(root, root.val)

# Example Usage
# Create a sample binary tree
#       3
#      / \
#     1   4
#        /
#       3
# Sample binary tree construction for testing
root = TreeNode(3)
root.left = TreeNode(1)
root.right = TreeNode(4)
root.right.left = TreeNode(3)

# Function call to count good nodes
print(count_good_nodes(root))  # Output should be 4
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity: O(N)**, where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity: O(H)**, where `H` is the height of the tree. This is the space required for the call stack during the DFS, which in the worst case (for a skewed tree) can be equal to the number of nodes, but in the average case will be proportional to the log of the number of nodes, i.e., O(log N).

This structured approach ensures that we systematically count the number of "good" nodes in a binary tree efficiently.
