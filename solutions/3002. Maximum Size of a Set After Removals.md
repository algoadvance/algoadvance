title:  Maximum Size of a Set After Removals-out
permalink: /s3002
---

You are given an integer array `nums` containing `n` unique integers, and an integer array `removalRequests` containing `k` requests, where each element in `removalRequests` denotes the removal of an element in `nums`. For each request in `removalRequests`, you should remove the corresponding element from `nums`, but you also want to maximize the size of the remaining set of unique elements.

You need to write a function `maximumSetSize(nums: List[int], removalRequests: List[int]) -> int` that returns the maximum size of the set of remaining unique integers after processing all removalRequests.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if all elements are requested to be removed?**
   - You should return `0` since there would be no elements left in the set.
  
2. **Can the removal requests contain indices of elements that are not present or already removed?**
   - No, it is guaranteed that all requested indices are valid and each index appears only once.

3. **Is it possible for the `removalRequests` array to be empty?**
   - Yes, it is possible for `removalRequests` to be empty, in which case the size of the set remains the original size of `nums`.

### Strategy

1. **Step-by-step Execution**:
   - Create a set from the list `nums` to ensure uniqueness.
   - Iterate through each element in `removalRequests`.
   - For each removal request, remove the corresponding element from the set.
   - Return the size of the set after processing all removal requests.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The `removalRequests` could be empty; the set size will remain as the size of `nums`.
   - All elements could be requested for removal; the set size will be `0`.

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: Creating a set from the list `nums` takes O(n) time.
- **Processing Requests**: Removing elements from a set takes O(1) time per removal request. Since there are `k` removal requests, this part will take O(k) time.
- **Overall Complexity**: Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n + k).

### Code

Here's the implementation in Python:

```python
from typing import List

def maximumSetSize(nums: List[int], removalRequests: List[int]) -> int:
    # Convert nums array to a set to ensure unique elements and for efficient removal
    num_set = set(nums)
    
    # Process each removal request
    for req in removalRequests:
        num_set.discard(req)  # Use discard to avoid KeyError if the element is not found
    
    # Return the size of the set after all removals
    return len(num_set)
```

### Explanation:

1. **set(nums)**: Converts `nums` list into a set to ensure we only have unique elements and allow for efficient element removal.
2. **for req in removalRequests**: Iterates through each removal request.
3. **num_set.discard(req)**: Removes the requested element from the set. `discard` is used instead of `remove` to avoid errors if the element is not found (although by problem guarantee, each element should exist).
4. **return len(num_set)**: Returns the size of the set after all removals.

This gives the maximum size of the set of remaining unique integers after processing all the removal requests.
