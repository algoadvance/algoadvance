### Problem Statement

You are supposed to simulate the movement of robots in a 1D plane. Given initial positions and movement directions of several robots, find the final positions after a certain number of steps.

Assume:
- The plane is infinite in both directions.
- Robots can cross each other without any interference.

Inputs:
- `positions`: a list of integers representing the initial positions of each robot.
- `directions`: a string where each character represents the direction ('L' for left and 'R' for right) each respective robot will move.
- `k`: an integer representing the number of steps each robot will move.

Output:
- Return a list of integers representing the final positions of the robots sorted in ascending order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Will the length of `positions` and `directions` always be the same?**
   - Yes, each robot has an initial position and a direction.

2. **Can the positions list contain duplicate positions?**
   - Yes, it can.

3. **Can `k` be negative or zero?**
   - `k` will be a non-negative integer (including zero).

4. **Is there any limit on the number of robots or size of their movements?**
   - For practical purposes, follow typical constraints (e.g., number of robots generally â‰¤ 10^4, positions within a reasonable range).

If everything is clear, let's move on to the solution.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Thought**: Each robot will move `k` units in its specified direction:
   - If the direction is 'L', the robot will move `k` units to the left (`initial_position - k`).
   - If the direction is 'R', the robot will move `k` units to the right (`initial_position + k`).

2. **Steps**:
    - Iterate through each robot's initial position and direction.
    - Compute the final position based on the direction and number of steps.
    - Store the computed position in a list.
    - Sort the final positions to meet the requirement of providing the output in ascending order.

3. **Complexity**:
    - **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to sorting, where `n` is the number of robots.
    - **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the final positions.

### Code

Let's implement it in Python:

```python
def final_positions(positions, directions, k):
    # Calculate the final positions
    final_positions = []
    for i in range(len(positions)):
        if directions[i] == 'L':
            final_positions.append(positions[i] - k)
        else:  # directions[i] == 'R'
            final_positions.append(positions[i] + k)
    
    # Sort the final positions
    final_positions.sort()
    
    return final_positions

# Example Usage:
positions = [1, 4, 6]
directions = "RRL"
k = 2
print(final_positions(positions, directions, k))  # Output should be [3, 5, 8]
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**: We initialize an empty list `final_positions` to store the resulting positions after `k` steps.
2. **Iteration**: We loop over each robot by its index:
    - If the direction is 'L', subtract `k` from the initial position.
    - If the direction is 'R', add `k` to the initial position.
3. **Sorting**: After computing all final positions, we sort them to ensure the output is in ascending order.
4. **Return**: Finally, we return the sorted list of final positions.

By following this approach, we efficiently determine and sort the final positions as required.
