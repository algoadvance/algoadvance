title:  Count Pairs Of Similar Strings-out
permalink: /s2506
---
You are given a 0-indexed string array `words`. 
Two strings are similar if they consist of the same characters.
- For example, "abca" and "cba" are similar since both consist of characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
- However, "ab" and "bbc" are not similar since they do not consist of the same characters.

Return the number of pairs `(i, j)` (where `0 <= i < j <= word.length - 1`) such that the two strings `words[i]` and `words[j]` are similar.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Are words guaranteed to be lowercase English alphabets?
   - Yes.
2. Can the input array contain duplicate words?
   - Yes.

### Strategy:
1. **Transform each word into a set of characters:** This will make it easier to compare words.
2. **Use a hashmap to count occurrences of unique character sets:** This allows us to efficiently calculate the number of pairs.
3. **Calculate pairs:** If a unique set of characters appears `n` times, the number of pairs is `n * (n - 1) / 2`.

### Code:
```python
def countPairs(words):
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    # Hashmap to store count of each unique character set
    count_map = defaultdict(int)
    
    # Populate the hashmap
    for word in words:
        char_set = ''.join(sorted(set(word)))  # Convert to a sorted string for use as key
        count_map[char_set] += 1
    
    # Calculate the number of pairs
    num_pairs = 0
    for count in count_map.values():
        if count > 1:
            num_pairs += (count * (count - 1)) // 2  # nC2 formula
    
    return num_pairs
```

### Time Complexity:
1. **Transforming each word into a character set:** Sorting takes \(O(k \log k)\) where \(k\) is the length of the word.
2. **Counting occurrences of unique character sets:** Insert each word into the hashmap takes \(O(1)\).
3. **Calculating pairs:** Iterating through the hashmap takes \(O(m)\) where \(m\) is the number of unique character sets in the map.

Overall, the time complexity can be approximated as \(O(n \cdot k \log k)\) where:
- \(n\) is the number of words.
- \(k\) is the average length of the words.

### Example:
```python
words = ["aba", "aaba", "baaa", "aaa", "bc"]
print(countPairs(words))  # Output should be 2
```
Explanation: 
- The similar pairs are ("aba", "baaa") and ("aaba", "baaa").
- The pair ("aba", "aaba") is not similar because "aaa" is not in both sets.
