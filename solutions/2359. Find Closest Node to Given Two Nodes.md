title:  Find Closest Node to Given Two Nodes-out
permalink: /s2359
---

You are given a directed graph where each node has exactly one outgoing edge. The graph is represented by an array `edges` where `edges[i]` is the destination node to which node `i` is connected. If there is no outgoing edge from node `i`, then `edges[i] == -1`. 

You are also given two nodes `node1` and `node2`. Your task is to return the index of the node that is closest to both `node1` and `node2`. If there are multiple answers, return the smallest index. If there is no such node, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What does "closest" mean in this context?**
   - "Closest" refers to the node that has the shortest maximum distance from both `node1` and `node2`.

2. **Can there be cycles in the graph?**
   - Yes, there can be cycles, but we are given that each node has exactly one outgoing edge or none, which simplifies traversal.

3. **Is it guaranteed that all nodes are reachable from any given node?**
   - No, it is not guaranteed that all nodes are reachable from any given node `node1` or `node2`.

4. **What are the constraints on the values of `edges` array and nodes?**
   - The length of the `edges` array and the values of `node1` and `node2` are within the range of the nodes defined.

### Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) / Depth-First Search (DFS):**
   - We can use BFS or DFS to find the distances from `node1` and `node2` to all other nodes in the graph.

2. **Distance Array:**
   - Maintain a distance array to keep track of the minimum distance from `node1` and `node2` to every other node.

3. **Evaluate the Closest Node:**
   - For each node, calculate the maximum of distances from `node1` and `node2`.
   - Identify the node with the smallest such maximum distance.

### Code

```python
def findClosestNode(edges, node1, node2):
    def getDistances(start):
        n = len(edges)
        dist = [-1] * n
        current_dist = 0
        while start != -1 and dist[start] == -1:
            dist[start] = current_dist
            current_dist += 1
            start = edges[start]
        return dist
    
    dist1 = getDistances(node1)
    dist2 = getDistances(node2)
    min_distance = float('inf')
    closest_node = -1
    
    for i in range(len(edges)):
        if dist1[i] == -1 or dist2[i] == -1:
            continue
        max_dist = max(dist1[i], dist2[i])
        if max_dist < min_distance or (max_dist == min_distance and i < closest_node):
            min_distance = max_dist
            closest_node = i
    
    return closest_node
```

### Time Complexity

- **O(n)**: where `n` is the number of nodes. The reason is that we traverse each node once to calculate the distances from `node1` and `node2` and then another pass to find the closest node.

### Explanation

1. **Distance Calculation:**
   - Use a helper function `getDistances` to perform a traversal starting from the given node and record distances to all reachable nodes.
   
2. **Comparative Analysis:**
   - Compare the distances of all nodes from `node1` and `node2`. 
   - Find the node with minimum of the maximum distances.
   
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Both nodes might not reach a common node.
   - Handle cyclic nodes by ensuring each node is visited only once. 

This strategy ensures we efficiently find the closest node to both given nodes by leveraging graph traversal and distance calculation.
