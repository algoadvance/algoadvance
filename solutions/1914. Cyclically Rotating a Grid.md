title:  Cyclically Rotating a Grid-out
permalink: /s1914
---
You are given an `m x n` 2D matrix `grid` that contains distinct integers. You want to cyclically rotate the grid `k` times. In one cyclic rotation, the elements of the grid move all the way around the border rows and columns of the grid. Consider the following steps for each cyclic rotation:

1. Select the outermost layer and move each of its elements to the next position in the clockwise direction.
2. Repeat the process for each layer moving inward.

Return the `grid` after performing `k` cyclic rotations.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of values for `m` and `n`?
   - Constraints are `1 <= m, n <= 50`.
2. Are k and other integer values always non-negative and within the typical bounds?
   - Constraints are `1 <= k <= 10^9`.
3. Is the grid guaranteed to be a well-formed matrix with all rows having the same number of columns?
   - Yes, the given grid is always a well-formed `m x n` matrix.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Identify and separate each layer of the grid.
2. Apply the specified number of cyclic rotations to each layer.
3. Reconstruct the grid with the rotated layers.

**Steps:**
1. For each layer, extract the elements into a list.
2. Rotate the list using the modulo operation to avoid unnecessary full cycles.
3. Place the rotated elements back into their corresponding positions in the grid.

### Code
Below is a Python implementation of the described strategy:

```python
def rotateGrid(grid, k):
    def rotate_layer(layer, k):
        # Rotate the layer by reducing k using modulo operation
        k = k % len(layer)
        return layer[-k:] + layer[:-k]

    m, n = len(grid), len(grid[0])
    total_layers = min(m, n) // 2

    for layer in range(total_layers):
        # Extract the current layer
        top, bottom, left, right = layer, m - layer - 1, layer, n - layer - 1
        elements = []

        # Top row (left to right)
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
            elements.append(grid[top][j])
        # Right column (top to bottom)
        for i in range(top + 1, bottom + 1):
            elements.append(grid[i][right])
        # Bottom row (right to left)
        for j in range(right - 1, left - 1, -1):
            elements.append(grid[bottom][j])
        # Left column (bottom to top)
        for i in range(bottom - 1, top, -1):
            elements.append(grid[i][left])

        # Rotate the extracted elements
        rotated = rotate_layer(elements, k)

        # Place the rotated elements back into the grid
        idx = 0
        # Top row (left to right)
        for j in range(left, right + 1):
            grid[top][j] = rotated[idx]
            idx += 1
        # Right column (top to bottom)
        for i in range(top + 1, bottom + 1):
            grid[i][right] = rotated[idx]
            idx += 1
        # Bottom row (right to left)
        for j in range(right - 1, left - 1, -1):
            grid[bottom][j] = rotated[idx]
            idx += 1
        # Left column (bottom to top)
        for i in range(bottom - 1, top, -1):
            grid[i][left] = rotated[idx]
            idx += 1

    return grid
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity primarily depends on the size of the grid and the number of rotations:
1. **Extraction and Re-insertion:** Each element is read and written exactly once, hence this is `O(m * n)`.
2. **Rotation Calculation:** Rotating a layer involves slicing and combining lists, which is `O(L)` where `L` is the number of elements in the layer.

Given that the grid has at most `50 * 50 = 2500` elements, and assuming typical constraints, the overall time complexity is approximately `O(m * n)`. 

This solution ensures efficiency even for large values of `k` by using modulo operations to minimize redundant rotations.
