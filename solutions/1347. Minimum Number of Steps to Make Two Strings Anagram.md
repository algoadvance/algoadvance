title:  Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram-out
permalink: /s1347
---

You are given two strings of the same length `s` and `t`. In one step you can choose any character of `t` and replace it with another character.

Return the minimum number of steps to make `t` an anagram of `s`.

An Anagram of a string is a string that contains the same characters with a different (or the same) ordering.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Length of Strings**: Are `s` and `t` guaranteed to be the same length?
   - Yes, the problem statement specifies that they are of the same length.

2. **Character Set**: Are the strings limited to lowercase English letters?
   - Yes, we can assume the strings are composed of lowercase English letters.

3. **Input Constraints**: What are the maximum lengths of `s` and `t`?
   - The constraints are not given but usually, LeetCode constraints for such problems are manageable within typical interview settings (e.g., up to `10^5` characters).

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to make the two strings `s` and `t` into anagrams by changing the minimum number of characters in `t`. The key observation here is that the only characters we need to change in `t` are those that are in excess compared to `s`.

Steps:
1. Count the frequency of each character in both strings `s` and `t`.
2. Determine the frequency of characters that are in excess in `t` compared to `s`.
3. Sum these excess frequencies to get the number of steps required to make `t` an anagram of `s`.

### Code

Hereâ€™s the implementation of the strategy:

```python
from collections import Counter

def minSteps(s: str, t: str) -> int:
    # Count the frequency of characters in s and t
    count_s = Counter(s)
    count_t = Counter(t)
    
    # Calculate the number of steps required
    steps = 0
    for char in count_s:
        if count_s[char] > count_t.get(char, 0):
            steps += count_s[char] - count_t[char]
        
    return steps

# Example usage:
s = "anagram"
t = "mangaar"
print(minSteps(s, t)) 
```

### Explanation

1. **Counting Frequencies**: `Counter(s)` and `Counter(t)` are used to count the frequency of each character in `s` and `t`, respectively.
2. **Calculate Steps**:
   - Loop through each character in `count_s` and compare its count with the count in `count_t`.
   - If `count_s[char]` is greater than `count_t[char]`, the difference indicates how many characters of `char` in `t` need to be changed.

### Time Complexity

- **Counting Frequencies**: O(n), where n is the length of strings `s` and `t`.
- **Calculating Steps**: O(1) because it iterates over a fixed set of 26 lowercase English letters.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n).
