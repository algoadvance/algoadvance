title:  Unique Number of Occurrences-out

Given an array of integers `arr`, you need to determine if the number of occurrences of each value in the array is unique.

More precisely, for an array `arr`, we have to check if the occurrences of each element in the array are all different. If the occurrences are unique, return `True`, otherwise return `False`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values in the array?**
   - The values can be any integer (both positive and negative).

2. **What is the maximum and minimum length of the array?**
   - The array can have a length ranging from 1 to 1000.

3. **Can the array be empty?**
   - Based on the problem statement, no, the array will have at least one element.

### Strategy

1. **Count Occurrences**:
   - Use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each element in the array.

2. **Check for Unique Occurrences**:
   - Store the occurrences in a set. Since sets do not allow duplicates, if the length of the set is equal to the number of unique elements in the original dictionary, then all occurrences are unique.
   - Otherwise, there are repeated occurrences.

### Code

Here is the complete Python code for the problem:

```python
from collections import Counter

def uniqueOccurrences(arr):
    # Step 1: Count occurrences of each element
    element_count = Counter(arr)
    
    # Step 2: Extract the occurrences
    occurrences = list(element_count.values())
    
    # Step 3: Check for unique occurrences
    return len(occurrences) == len(set(occurrences))

# Example usage:
# arr = [1,2,2,1,1,3]
# The output should be True because the counts are {1: 3, 2: 2, 3: 1} and they are all unique.
print(uniqueOccurrences([1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3]))  # Output: True
```

### Time Complexity

- **Counting occurrences**: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array.
- **Converting to the list and set**: O(k) where k is the number of unique elements.
- **Overall Time Complexity**: O(n) + O(k) which simplifies to O(n) since k â‰¤ n.

This approach ensures that the problem is solved efficiently even for the maximum constraint size.
