title:  Unique Length-3 Palindromic Subsequences-out
permalink: /s1930
---

You need to count the number of unique palindromic subsequences of length 3 that appear in the given string. A palindromic subsequence is a sequence that reads the same forwards and backwards. For example, in the string "aabaa", the subsequences "aaa", "aba", "aaa" are palindromic. Your task is to count distinct ones.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input string contain non-alphabetic characters?**
   - No, the input string will only contain lowercase alphabetic characters.

2. **What is the expected maximum length of the input string?**
   - The maximum length of the string can be up to 10^5.

3. **Do we consider overlapping subsequences?**
   - Yes, overlapping subsequences are considered as long as they form a length-3 palindromic subsequence.

### Strategy

1. **Identify the Structure:**
   - A length-3 palindromic subsequence should look like "aba", where `a` and `b` are characters in the string and the same character appears at the first and the last position.

2. **Frequency Count:**
   - Use frequency dictionaries to maintain the left and right occurrence of characters as we iterate through the string.

3. **Iterate and Count:**
   - Iterate through the string while keeping track of characters seen so far (`left_count`).
   - For each character (let's call it the middle character in a potential "aba"), look for all possible characters that can wrap around it to form a palindromic subsequence.
   - Use the `left_count` for characters seen to the left of the current character.
   - Use `right_count` for characters seen to the right of the current character.
   - Update the counts and store any unique "aba" formed.

4. **Optimization:**
   - Given the constraints, we want to make sure our solution is efficient. Ideally, it should be linear with respect to the length of the string.

### Code

```python
def count_palindromic_subsequence(s: str) -> int:
    # Frequency dictionaries for character occurences on the left and right
    left_count = [0] * 26
    right_count = [0] * 26
    
    # Initial right count (frequency of each char in the string)
    for char in s:
        right_count[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1
    
    unique_palindromes = set()
    
    # Iterate through the string to find possible palindromic subsequences
    for i, char in enumerate(s):
        # Decrement the right count for current character
        right_count[ord(char) - ord('a')] -= 1
        
        # Current character is the middle character of the palindromic subsequence
        for j in range(26):
            if left_count[j] > 0 and right_count[j] > 0:
                unique_palindromes.add(chr(j + ord('a')) + char + chr(j + ord('a')))
        
        # Increment the left count for current character
        left_count[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1
        
    return len(unique_palindromes)

# Example usage:
s = "aabca"
print(count_palindromic_subsequence(s))  # Output: 3, because "aba", "aca", and "bcb" are unique palindromic subsequences.
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n + 26*n) â‰ˆ O(n)
  - The algorithm makes a single pass through the string to initialize the right counts.
  - It then iterates through the string, performing constant-time operations for each character (checking for potential palindromes across 26 possible characters).

- **Space Complexity:** O(26) = O(1)
  - We are using fixed-size arrays (of length 26) for the left and right counts, along with a set to store the unique palindromes. This requires constant space.
