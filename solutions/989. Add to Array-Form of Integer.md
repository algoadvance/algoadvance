title:  Add to Array-Form of Integer-out
permalink: /s989
---
The problem is taken from LeetCode: "Add to Array-Form of Integer".

Given an array `num` representing a non-negative integer `num`, and an integer `k`, return the array-form of the integer `num + k`. The array-form of an integer is an array representing its digits in left to right order.

#### Example 1:
- Input: `num = [1,2,0,0]`, `k = 34`
- Output: `[1,2,3,4]`

#### Example 2:
- Input: `num = [2,7,4]`, `k = 181`
- Output: `[4,5,5]`

#### Example 3:
- Input: `num = [2,1,5]`, `k = 806`
- Output: `[1,0,2,1]`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the array `num` be empty?** 
   - No, `num` will represent a non-negative integer, so it must contain at least one digit.
2. **Can `k` be negative?**
   - No, `k` is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

### Strategy
1. **Convert the array-form to an integer**:
   - Traverse the array and recreate the integer it represents.
2. **Add `k` to the integer value**.
3. **Convert the result back to an array-form**:
   - Parse each digit of the resultant integer and store them in a list.

### Code
```python
def addToArrayForm(num, k):
    # Step 1: Convert array-form to an integer
    num_as_int = 0
    for digit in num:
        num_as_int = num_as_int * 10 + digit
    
    # Step 2: Add k to the integer value
    num_as_int += k
    
    # Step 3: Convert the result back to array-form
    result = [int(d) for d in str(num_as_int)]
    return result
```

### Time Complexity
- Converting the array to an integer: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the array.
- Adding `k` is a constant time operation: `O(1)`.
- Converting the result back to an array: `O(m)` where `m` is the number of digits in the result (`num_as_int + k`).
- Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n + m)`.

In most cases, `m` (number of digits in the resultant sum) will be close to `n`, so the time complexity can be approximated to `O(n)`. 

### Edge Cases
1. **Single digit in `num`**: Verify the function performs correctly when `num` has only one digit.
2. **Carry over scenarios**: Ensure proper handling of carries when adding `k` causes digits to reflect a carry over, e.g., `num = [9, 9, 9]` and `k = 2`.
3. **Large values of `k`**: Function must handle cases where `k` has more digits than `num`.

The above code provides a comprehensive solution to the problem by accurately converting the input format and performing the requested operation while considering time efficiency.
