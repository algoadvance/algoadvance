title:  Time to Cross a Bridge-out
permalink: /s2532
---

A group of workers are given two tasks. They need to cross a bridge, but they must do so in pairs. Each worker has a minute threshold they need to achieve before being allowed to cross the bridge. Given that the workers can cross in pairs, the time it takes for a pair to cross the bridge is determined by the slower worker of the two. We are to determine the minimum time required for all workers to cross the bridge.

### Problem Constraints:
- The number of workers, denoted as `n`, is in the range \(1 \leq n \leq 10^4\).
- Each worker's threshold is provided as an integer array `workers` where `workers[i]` represents the time threshold of the i-th worker.

### Example:
Input: 
```
workers = [1, 2, 5, 10]
```

Output:
```
17
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Is there a limit to the number of workers that can cross at the same time?** - Yes, they can only cross in pairs.
2. **Does the bridge need to be crossed multiple times?** - Yes, if there are more than two workers, the initial crossing pair will need to return with a torch to allow others to cross.

## Strategy
To minimize the total time it takes for all the workers to cross the bridge, we may need a strategy that balances sending the slower workers together and optimizing the return trips. One viable approach here is using a greedy strategy combined with an iterative simulation:

1. **Sort the Workers**: Sort the array of workers in ascending order of their thresholds.
2. **Simulate the Crossings**:
    - Always pair the two fastest workers to cross first.
    - Handle the return trips optimally.

To implement this, we will:
- Sort the `workers` list.
- Use a loop to simulate the crossing and returning process.

## Solution and Code

```python
def minTimeToCross(workers):
    # Sort workers by their threshold times
    workers.sort()
    total_time = 0
    while len(workers) > 3:
        # Two strategies to choose from:
        # 1. Pair the two fastest, and the two slowest workers:
        #   - Send the two fastest: [0] and [1]
        #   - One of them returns: [0]
        #   - Send the two slowest: [-1] and [-2]
        #   - One of the fastest returns: [1]
        # 2. Pair the fastest and the slowest each time:
        #   - Send the fastest: [0]
        #   - One of the fastest returns: [0]
        # In strategy 1*(use_cost_1) or strategy 2 (use_cost_2)
        # Use the cost strategy with the lowest time
        n = len(workers)
        use_cost_1 = 2 * workers[1] + workers[0] + workers[n - 1]
        use_cost_2 = 2 * workers[0] + workers[n - 2] + workers[n - 1]

        total_time += min(use_cost_1, use_cost_2)

        # Remove the slowest two who already crossed
        workers = workers[:-2]
    
    # If there are 3 or fewer workers left, handle these base cases directly:
    if len(workers) == 3:
        total_time += workers[2] + workers[1] + workers[0]
    elif len(workers) == 2:
        total_time += workers[1]
    elif len(workers) == 1:
        total_time += workers[0]
    
    return total_time

# Example usage
workers = [1, 2, 5, 10]
print(minTimeToCross(workers))  # Output: 17
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: `O(n log n)`
- **Simulation**: Each iteration reduces the list size by 2, resulting in `O(n)`.

So, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)` which is efficient for the given constraints.
