title:  Linked List in Binary Tree-out
permalink: /s1367
---
You are given a binary tree and a linked list. Your task is to determine if the linked list is a subpath in the binary tree.

A subpath in the binary tree is a downward path which means starting from some node and moving downwards towards any of its children nodes in the next level. You need to ensure that the linked list is represented entirely within this path.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the size of the linked list and tree?**
   - **Constraints:**
      - The number of nodes in the tree (n) will be in the range [1, 5000].
      - The number of nodes in the list (m) will be in the range [1, 100].

2. **Can the values of the nodes in the binary tree and the linked list be negative?**
   - Yes, the values of the nodes can be negative.

3. **Is there any specific way the path should be taken?**
   - The path should be downward, meaning it starts from a given node and follows the child nodes.

4. **Can the linked list be an empty list?**
   - No, as per the constraints, the minimum number of nodes in the list is 1.

### Strategy
1. **Tree Traversal:** We'll perform a depth-first search (DFS) on the binary tree to locate a starting point that matches the head of the linked list.
2. **Path Matching:** Once a potential starting point is found, a helper function will check if the linked list matches a path in the tree starting from that node.
3. **Recursive Check:** The helper function will recursively check if the next node in the list matches the left or right child of the current tree node.
4. **Edge Cases:** Handle cases where the tree node or list node is `None`.

### Code
Here's the implementation following the explained strategy:

```python
class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def isSubPath(head: ListNode, root: TreeNode) -> bool:
    if not head:
        return True  # An empty list is trivially a subpath
    if not root:
        return False  # Non-empty list cannot be a subpath in an empty tree

    def dfs(tree_node, list_node):
        if not list_node:
            return True
        if not tree_node:
            return False
        if tree_node.val != list_node.val:
            return False

        return dfs(tree_node.left, list_node.next) or dfs(tree_node.right, list_node.next)

    def check_subpath_from_node(tree_root):
        if not tree_root:
            return False
        if tree_root.val == head.val and dfs(tree_root, head):
            return True
        return check_subpath_from_node(tree_root.left) or check_subpath_from_node(tree_root.right)

    return check_subpath_from_node(root)
```

### Time Complexity
- **Tree Depth-first Search:** O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree.
- **Path Matching for each node:** O(m) for each node where m is the length of the linked list.
- Worst case, you may need to check every node in the tree.
  
So the overall time complexity is O(n * m), where n is the number of nodes in the binary tree and m is the number of nodes in the linked list.

### Space Complexity
- **Recursion stack for DFS on tree:** O(h) where h is the height of the binary tree.
- **Recursion stack for linked list matching:** O(m).
  
So the space complexity is O(h + m).
