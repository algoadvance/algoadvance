title:  Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix-out
permalink: /s329
---

The problem is described on LeetCode as follows:

Given an `m x n` integers matrix, return the length of the longest increasing path in the matrix. From each cell, you can move in four directions: left, right, up, or down. You may not move diagonally or move outside the boundary (i.e., wrap-around is not allowed).

### Clarifying Questions

To ensure a clear understanding of the problem, here are some clarifying questions and their answers:

1. **Can the path contain equal consecutive numbers?**
   - No, the path must be strictly increasing.

2. **Is it possible to have a matrix with negative numbers or zeros?**
   - Yes, the matrix can contain any integer values including negatives and zeros.

3. **What are the matrix dimensions?**
   - The matrix dimensions can be any size within reasonable constraints, typically `1 x 1` to `200 x 200` on LeetCode.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we should use Depth-First Search (DFS) combined with memoization. Here's a step-by-step strategy:

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** 
   - We'll perform a DFS from each cell to explore the longest path originating from that cell. 

2. **Memoization:**
   - Use a memoization table (`dp`) to store the results of already computed paths to avoid redundant calculations. 
   - If the longest path starting from a cell `(i, j)` is already computed, reuse that value.

3. **Direction Vectors:**
   - Use direction vectors to move in the four possible directions (left, right, up, down) from any given cell.

4. **Recursively Explore:**
   - For each cell, move to its neighboring cells if the neighbor has a larger value, and recursively compute the path length from there.
   - The result for each cell will be `1 + maximum of the path lengths of all valid moves`.

5. **Global Maximum:**
   - The result will be the maximum length found for any cell in the matrix.

### Code

Here is the code implementing the above strategy in Python:

```python
def longestIncreasingPath(matrix):
    if not matrix or not matrix[0]:
        return 0
    
    def dfs(x, y):
        if dp[x][y] != -1:
            return dp[x][y]
        
        max_path = 1
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x + dx, y + dy
            if 0 <= nx < m and 0 <= ny < n and matrix[nx][ny] > matrix[x][y]:
                max_path = max(max_path, 1 + dfs(nx, ny))
        
        dp[x][y] = max_path
        return dp[x][y]
    
    m, n = len(matrix), len(matrix[0])
    dp = [[-1] * n for _ in range(m)]
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    longest_path = 0
    
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            longest_path = max(longest_path, dfs(i, j))
    
    return longest_path

# Example usage:
matrix = [
    [9, 9, 4],
    [6, 6, 8],
    [2, 1, 1]
]
print(longestIncreasingPath(matrix))  # Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is O(m * n) where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns:
- Each cell is visited once and computed once due to memoization.
- The DFS exploration for each cell involves exploring up to 4 neighboring cells, which is a constant factor.

Thus, the overall complexity is O(m * n).
