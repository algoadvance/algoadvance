title:  Minimum Number of Operations to Make Word K-Periodic-out
permalink: /s3137
---

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, the task is to find the minimum number of operations needed to make `s` k-periodic. A string is k-periodic if, by rearranging its characters, you can obtain a string where every substring of length `k` is identical. 
An operation consists of changing one character to another character.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What is the allowed range for `s` and `k`?**
   - Typical constraints would be helpful. For example, is `s` always a valid string, or can it be empty? Are there any size constraints for `k`?

2. **What would be an example case and expected output?**
   - Can we go through a sample input/output to ensure our understanding is correct?

3. **Is the case sensitivity considered in the operations?**
   - Should we treat 'A' and 'a' as different characters or the same?

Since we do not have the actual constraints and to proceed efficiently, I'll assume reasonable constraints.

### Strategy:

1. **Identify Different Segments of k-periodic Substrings:**
   - Split the string into segments where each segment is responsible for making its character identical across the k-period parts.
  
2. **Count Character Frequencies:**
   - For each position within `k`-segments, count the frequency of each character.

3. **Calculate Changes Required:**
   - Calculate the minimum changes required by finding the most frequent character for each `i % k` group.
   
4. **Sum Up Operations:**
   - Sum the operations needed for each group to convert the string into a k-periodic string.

### Example:

For instance, given `s = "abaaba"` and `k = 3`:
   - Split the string by modulus indices: ["aa", "bb", "aa"]
   - For each part, find the majority character and change others to it.

### Code:

Here's a Python code implementation for the approach described:

```python
def min_operations_to_make_k_periodic(s, k):
    from collections import Counter
    
    n = len(s)
    operations = 0
    
    # We need to iterate over groups of indices within the k-period
    for i in range(k):
        # Count how frequent each character is in the i-th position of the k-groups
        count = Counter()
        for j in range(i, n, k):
            count[s[j]] += 1
        
        # Find the most frequent character in this group
        max_freq = max(count.values())
        
        # Number of operations to make this segment k-periodic
        # (total characters in this segment) - (most frequent character count)
        total_chars_in_group = (n - i + k - 1) // k
        operations += total_chars_in_group - max_freq
    
    return operations

# Example usage:
s = "abaaba"
k = 3
print(min_operations_to_make_k_periodic(s, k))  # Output should adjust according to operations needed
```

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of the solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the string. This is because:
- We iterate over the string in chunks based on `k`.
- For each chunk, we count character frequencies which takes linear time within the segment.

The space complexity is **O(k)** to store the counts for each segment, which is efficient and manageable for typical input sizes.

This algorithm ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum operations required to make the string k-periodic.
