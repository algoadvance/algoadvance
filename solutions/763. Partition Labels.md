You are given a string `s`. We want to partition this string into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part. Return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

### Example:
```python
Input: s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
Output: [9, 7, 8]
Explanation:
The partitions are "ababcbaca", "defegde", "hijhklij".
This is because:
- "a", "b", and "c" appear in the first part.
- "d", "e", "f", and "g" appear in the second part.
- "h", "i", "j", "k", and "l" appear in the third part.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Is the input string `s` guaranteed to be non-empty?
   - Can the input string contain any characters other than lowercase English letters?

**Assumptions based on standard problem constraints:**
- `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
- The length of `s` is at most 500.

2. **Output Constraints:**
   - Should the output list provide partition sizes in the same order as they appear in the input string?

## Strategy

### Steps:
1. **Calculate Last Occurrences:** Traverse the string to record the last position (index) of each character.
2. **Initialize Pointers:** Use two pointers to denote the current segment start and end. Initialize both at 0.
3. **Expand and Determine Segments:** Iterate through the string, expanding the current segment until it encapsulates the last occurrence of all characters in that segment.
4. **Store Partition Size:** Once the segment end is reached, record its size and move to the next segment.

### Implementation Outline:
1. Traverse the string to create a dictionary of the last occurrence of each character.
2. Iterate through the string to identify partitions:
   - As each character is processed, update the segment end to the maximum of the current segment end or the last occurrence of the character.
   - When the current index matches the segment end, it signifies the end of a partition.

## Time Complexity
- **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because:
  - Creating the dictionary of last occurrences requires O(n).
  - A single pass through the string to form partitions takes O(n).

```python
def partition_labels(s):
    # Calculate the last occurrence of each character
    last_occurrence = {char: idx for idx, char in enumerate(s)}

    partitions = []
    start = 0
    end = 0

    # Traverse the string to find the partitions
    for idx, char in enumerate(s):
        end = max(end, last_occurrence[char])

        # When we reach the end of the current partition
        if idx == end:
            partitions.append(end - start + 1)
            start = idx + 1
    
    return partitions

# Example usage:
s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij"
print(partition_labels(s))  # Output: [9, 7, 8]
```

This code snippet achieves the desired partitioning of the string as described in the problem statement, ensuring that each character appears in at most one part of the partitioned string.
