title:  Minimum Operations to Make Array Equal-out
permalink: /s1551
---
You have an array `arr` of length `n`, where `n` is an **odd** integer and `arr[i] = 2*i + 1` for all the valid values of `i` (i.e., 0 <= i < n).

In one operation, you can select two indices `x` and `y` where `0 <= x, y < n` and subtract `1` from `arr[x]` and add `1` to `arr[y]` (i.e., `arr[x] -= 1` and `arr[y] += 1`). The goal is to make all the elements of the array equal. You need to find the minimum number of operations required to make all the elements of the array equal.

Return *the minimum number of operations needed to make all the elements of `arr` equal*.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on `n`?**
   - The problem typically ensures `n` is a positive odd integer. 

2. **Is it guaranteed that `arr` can always be made equal using the allowed operation?**
   - Yes, it is always possible to make the array equal with the allowed operation.

### Strategy
We know that:

1. The array `arr` is defined as `arr[i] = 2*i + 1`.
2. The median will be the middle element of the sorted array since it balances the smaller and larger elements, minimizing the number of operations for balancing.

Our goal is to find the minimum number of operations to make all elements equal to the median.

The idea is straightforward:
1. If we make the elements equal to the median, the absolute differences to the left will be balanced by the absolute differences to the right.
2. We calculate the median as `arr[n // 2]` since `n` is odd.

We can follow these steps:

1. Find the target value (median).
2. Calculate the sum of absolute differences between each element and the median.
3. Since for each difference, we need one operation, the sum of absolute differences will be our result.

### Code

```python
def minOperations(n: int) -> int:
    median = n // 2
    
    # Calculate target value to make all elements equal (normalize towards median)
    target = 2 * median + 1
    
    # Calculate sum of differences from each element to median
    operations = 0
    for i in range(median):
        current_value = 2 * i + 1
        operations += target - current_value
        
    return operations

# Example usage:
n = 5
print(minOperations(n))  # Output should be 6
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n/2)\), which simplifies to \(O(n)\). Given that we are iterating through half of the array to sum up the operations, this is efficient and optimal for the given problem constraints.
