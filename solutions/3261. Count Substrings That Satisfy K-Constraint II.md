title:  Count Substrings That Satisfy K-Constraint II-out
permalink: /s3261

### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. Write a function to count the number of substrings of `s` where any character appears at most `k` times. 

**Example:**
- Input: `s = "aabbcc"`, `k = 2`
- Output: `15`
  
The substrings that meet the criteria are: all individual characters, "aa", "bb", "cc", "aab", "bbc", "bcca", "aabb", "bbcc", "abbcc", "aabbc", "abbc".

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the substrings contiguous segments of the string?**
   - Yes, substrings are contiguous segments of the original string `s`.

2. **What is the maximum length of the string `s`?**
   - Assume `s` can be reasonably long, but not excessively largeâ€”up to around \(10^4\) characters.

3. **What kind of characters will `s` contain?**
   - The string `s` will consist of lowercase English letters only.

### Strategy

1. We will use a sliding window approach to explore all possible substrings of `s`.
2. Maintain a count of character frequencies within the current window.
3. Expand the window by moving its right boundary.
4. If at any point any character's frequency exceeds `k`, move the left boundary of the window to reduce the frequency.
5. Count the valid substrings within each window configuration.

### Code

```python
def count_k_constraint_substrings(s: str, k: int) -> int:
    from collections import defaultdict
    
    n = s.length
    count = 0
    left = 0
    char_freq = defaultdict(int)
    
    for right in range(n):
        char_freq[s[right]] += 1
        
        while any(freq > k for freq in char_freq.values()):
            char_freq[s[left]] -= 1
            if char_freq[s[left]] == 0:
                del char_freq[s[left]]
            left += 1
        
        count += right - left + 1
    
    return count

# Example use case
print(count_k_constraint_substrings("aabbcc", 2))  # Output: 15
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization:** 
   - `char_freq`: A dictionary that keeps track of the frequency of each character in the current window.
   - `left`: The left boundary of the sliding window.
   - `count`: The total count of valid substrings.

2. **Expand the Window:** 
   - We loop through the string using `right` as the right boundary of the window.
   - Update `char_freq` with the current character `s[right]`.

3. **Shrink the Window if Necessary:**
   - Check if any character in the window violates the frequency constraint using `char_freq`.
   - If so, increment `left` to shrink the window until all characters satisfy the constraint.

4. **Count Valid Substrings:** 
   - All substrings ending at `right` and starting from `left` to `right` are valid.
   - Add the number of such substrings (`right - left + 1`) to `count`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string \(s\). The while loop inside the for loop ensures that each character is processed at most twice.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), assuming the character set size (26 lowercase letters) is constant. The additional space is used for the `char_freq` dictionary.
