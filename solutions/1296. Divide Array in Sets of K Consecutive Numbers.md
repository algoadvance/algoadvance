title:  Divide Array in Sets of K Consecutive Numbers-out
permalink: /s1296
---

Given an array of integers `nums` and a positive integer `k`, determine whether it is possible to divide the array into sets of `k` consecutive numbers.

### Example
- **Input:** nums = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,6], k = 4
- **Output:** True
- **Explanation:** The array can be divided into [1,2,3,4] and [3,4,5,6].

- **Input:** nums = [3,3,2,2,1,1], k = 3
- **Output:** True
- **Explanation:** The array can be divided into [1,2,3] and [1,2,3].

- **Input:** nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 3
- **Output:** False
- **Explanation:** It is not possible to divide the array into sets of 3 consecutive numbers.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the numbers in the `nums` array sorted?**
   - No, they are not necessarily sorted.

2. **Can the array have duplicate numbers?**
   - Yes, the array can have duplicate numbers.

3. **Is it guaranteed that the array always has more than one element?**
   - No, the array can have zero or more elements.

4. **What should be the output if the array is empty?**
   - If the array is empty and `k` is not zero, the output should be `False`.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - If the length of `nums` is not divisible by `k`, it's impossible to divide the array as required, so return `False`.

2. **Count Frequencies**:
   - Use a `Counter` to count the frequency of each number in `nums`.

3. **Form Sets**:
   - Iterate through the sorted unique numbers.
   - For each number, attempt to create a set starting with that number.
   - Reduce the count in the Counter for each number in the set.
   - If at any point, a required number is unavailable (count is zero or insufficient), return `False`.

4. **Completion**:
   - If all sets are successfully created, return `True`.

### Code
```python
from collections import Counter

def isPossibleDivide(nums, k):
    if len(nums) % k != 0:
        return False
    
    num_count = Counter(nums)
    
    for num in sorted(num_count):
        if num_count[num] > 0:
            count = num_count[num]
            for i in range(num, num + k):
                if num_count[i] < count:
                    return False
                num_count[i] -= count
    
    return True

# Test the function with an example
print(isPossibleDivide([1,2,3,3,4,4,5,6], 4))  # Should return True
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting** the numbers will take \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array.
- **Counting frequencies** takes \(O(n)\).
- **Forming sets** will effectively iterate through the list a constant number of times for k elements, taking \(O(n)\) in the worst case due to the nested loop over a constant range \(k\).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).
