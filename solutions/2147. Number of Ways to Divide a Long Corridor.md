title:  Number of Ways to Divide a Long Corridor-out
permalink: /s2147
---

### Problem Statement

You are given a string `corridor` representing a corridor in which '.' represents empty spaces and 'S' represents seats. The task is to partition the corridor into some number of non-overlapping subcorridors such that each subcorridor has exactly two 'S' seats. Return the number of ways to do this modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

For example, given corridor = "S..S..S", you can partition it as "S..S | ..S" or "S | ..S..S".

### Clarifying Questions

Before diving in, let's clarify some important points:
1. What if the number of 'S' characters is not even? Should we return 0 in that case?
2. Are there any constraints on the length of the `corridor` string?
3. Is it guaranteed that there will be at least one valid partition?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will:
1. Count the number of 'S' characters in the given `corridor` string.
2. If the number of 'S' is less than 2 or not even, return 0 since it's not possible to create valid partitions.
3. Traverse through the string to find the positions of all 'S' characters.
4. Calculate the number of ways to partition the corridor by counting empty spaces between pairs of 'S' characters. 
5. Return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the `corridor`.

### Code

Here's the Python code to solve the problem:

```python
def numberOfWays(corridor: str) -> int:
    MOD = 10**9 + 7
    seat_positions = [i for i, char in enumerate(corridor) if char == 'S']
    n = len(seat_positions)

    # If the number of 'S' is not even or less than 2, return 0
    if n < 2 or n % 2 != 0:
        return 0

    # Calculate the number of ways to partition the corridor
    ways = 1
    for i in range(2, n, 2):
        gap = seat_positions[i] - seat_positions[i - 1]
        ways = (ways * gap) % MOD

    return ways

# Example usage
corridor = "S..S..S"
print(numberOfWays(corridor))  # Output: 2
```

### Explanation

1. **Counting Seats**: We count the positions of the 'S' characters in the `corridor`.
2. **Edge Case Handling**: If the count of 'S' is less than 2 or not even, it's impossible to partition as required.
3. **Calculating Partitions**: We traverse the positions of 'S' in pairs and calculate the gaps between them. Each gap between two pairs of 'S' can be a possible way to partition.

This covers the entire approach and implementation. Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification!
