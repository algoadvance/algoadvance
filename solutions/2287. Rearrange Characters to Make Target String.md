title:  Rearrange Characters to Make Target String-out
permalink: /s2287
---
You are given two strings `s` and `target`. You want to form as many instances of the string `target` as possible by rearranging the characters of the string `s`. Note that each character in `s` can only be used once in each instance of `target`.

Return the maximum number of instances of `target` that can be formed.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Character Case Sensitivity:** Is the problem case-sensitive?
    - Yes, the problem is case-sensitive. 'a' and 'A' are considered different characters.
2. **Input Constraints:** What are the constraints on the lengths of `s` and `target`?
    - Typically problems like this will have strings of lengths that can be comfortably handled by modern computers.

### Strategy
1. **Count Characters in Both Strings:** First, count the occurrences of each character in both `s` and `target`.
2. **Calculate Feasibility:** For each character in `target`, check how many times it can be formed using the characters in `s`. The minimum ratio of available characters to needed characters across all characters in `target` will determine how many times `target` can be formed.

### Code
Let's implement this strategy in Python:

```python
from collections import Counter

def rearrangeCharacters(s: str, target: str) -> int:
    # Count characters in s and target
    s_count = Counter(s)
    target_count = Counter(target)
    
    # Initialize the maximum number with a large value
    max_instances = float('inf')
    
    # Calculate the number of times we can form target from s
    for char in target_count:
        if char in s_count:
            max_instances = min(max_instances, s_count[char] // target_count[char])
        else:
            return 0
    
    return max_instances

# Example Usage
s = "ilovecodingonleetcode"
target = "code"
print(rearrangeCharacters(s, target))  # Output should be 2
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is:

- **Character Counting:** O(n + m) where n is the length of `s` and m is the length of `target`.
- **Ratio Calculation:** O(m), iterating over the unique characters in `target`.

So, the overall time complexity is O(n + m). The space complexity is O(n + m) due to the storage in the `Counter` objects.
