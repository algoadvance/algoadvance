title:  Shortest Subarray With OR at Least K I-out
permalink: /s3095
---

Given an array of non-negative integers `nums` and an integer `K`, find the length of the shortest, non-empty subarray of `nums` such that the bitwise OR of every element in the subarray is at least `K`. If no such subarray exists, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Can elements in `nums` be zero?**
   - A: Yes, they can be. The array contains non-negative integers, including zero.

2. **Q: What range of values can `K` have?**
   - A: `K` can be any non-negative integer.

3. **Q: Can `K` be zero?**
   - A: Yes, `K` can also be zero. In which case, any non-empty subarray will meet the condition.

4. **Q: What should we return if no subarray meets the requirement?**
   - A: Return -1.

5. **Q: What is the maximum length of the array `nums`?**
   - A: This isn't specified, but we will assume it fits in the memory constraints typical for LeetCode problems.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Start with left and right pointers for a sliding window (both initialized to 0).
   - Use a variable to maintain the current OR value of the subarray.

2. **Expanding the Window:**
   - Expand the window to the right by moving the right pointer and updating the OR.

3. **Validating the Window:**
   - Whenever the current OR satisfies the condition (i.e., it's at least `K`), try to minimize the window by moving the left pointer to the right while keeping the condition satisfied.

4. **Updating the Result:**
   - Keep track of the minimum length of all valid windows.

5. **Stopping Condition:**
   - If we have moved through the entire array, return the minimum length found. If no window meets the condition, return -1.

### Code

```python
def shortest_subarray_with_or_at_least_k(nums, K):
    n = len(nums)
    min_len = float('inf')
    current_or = 0
    left = 0

    for right in range(n):
        current_or |= nums[right]  # Expand the window
        
        while left <= right and current_or >= K:  # Contract the window
            min_len = min(min_len, right - left + 1)
            current_or ^= nums[left]  # Remove the leftmost element from OR
            left += 1
            
    return min_len if min_len != float('inf') else -1

# Example usage:
nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
K = 7
print(shortest_subarray_with_or_at_least_k(nums, K))  # Output: Expected subarray length
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because each element is processed at most twice (once when expanding the window and once when contracting).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we use a constant amount of extra space.

The sliding window approach ensures that we efficiently find the shortest subarray by maintaining the minimal required checks and updates.
