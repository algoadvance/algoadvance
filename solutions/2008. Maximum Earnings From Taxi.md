title:  Maximum Earnings From Taxi-out
permalink: /s2008
---

You are given n tasks and an array tasks where tasks[i] = [pickup_i, drop_i, tip_i]. You have one taxi that can only do one task at a time. Each task represents a ride where you pick up a passenger at pickup_i location and drop them at drop_i location. The earnings after completing a ride are drop_i - pickup_i + tip_i.

* You can start any task at any time, but once you start a task, you cannot pick up another passenger until the current task is completed.
* You can delay the start of a task to maximize your earnings.
 
Return **the maximum earnings you can make**.

### Example
```
Input: 
n = 3
tasks = [[1,6,2],[2,8,4],[3,10,3]]

Output:
17

Explanation:
Task 1: Pickup at 1, drop at 6, tip = 2 => Earnings = 6 - 1 + 2 = 7
Task 2: Pickup at 2, drop at 8, tip = 4 => Earnings = 8 - 2 + 4 = 10
Task 3: Pickup at 3, drop at 10, tip = 3 => Earnings = 10 - 3 + 3 = 10
Max earnings = 7 + 10 = 17
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the tasks always given in chronological order by pickup time?**
   - No, the input tasks are not guaranteed to be sorted.

2. **Can the pickup and drop locations be the same?**
   - It's less likely but possible as the task constraints do not prohibit it.

3. **What is the range of n?**
   - The number of tasks `n` could be very large, say up to `10^5`.

4. **Is there a time constraint within which all the tasks need to be completed?**
   - No, work can continue indefinitely.

### Strategy

The problem is a variant of the Weighted Interval Scheduling problem, which can be efficiently solved using dynamic programming coupled with binary search for finding the maximum non-conflicting subset of jobs.

1. **Sort Jobs by Drop Time:** Sort the tasks based on their drop times. This allows us to efficiently use dynamic programming to accumulate the maximum earnings possible up to that task.

2. **Dynamic Programming Array:** Create a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` holds the maximum earnings up to the `i-th` task.

3. **Binary Search for Non-conflict:** For each task, use binary search to find the latest task (let's call it `j`) which doesn't conflict with the current task `i`. This means finding the largest `j` such that `tasks[j][1] <= tasks[i][0]`.

4. **Transition:** The state transition will be `dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[j] + earnings[i])`.

5. **Calculate Earnings:** The earnings for each task are given by the formula: `drop_i - pickup_i + tip_i`.

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** `O(n log n)` due to sorting tasks based on drop times.
- **DP computation:** `O(n log n)` as each binary search takes `O(log n)` and we do it for each task.

### Code

Here is the complete solution in Python:

```python
from bisect import bisect_right

def maxTaxiEarnings(n, tasks):
    # Sort tasks by their drop times
    tasks.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])
    
    # Create dp array and initialization
    dp = [0] * (n + 1)
    # List of drop times for binary search
    end_times = [x[1] for x in tasks]
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        pickup, drop, tip = tasks[i-1]
        # Calculate current earnings
        current_earnings = drop - pickup + tip
        
        # Binary search to find the last non-conflicting task
        prev_index = bisect_right(end_times, pickup) - 1
        
        # Update the dp value
        if prev_index != -1:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], dp[prev_index+1] + current_earnings)
        else:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], current_earnings)
    
    # Answer will be the maximum earnings up to the last task
    return dp[n]
```

### Usage

```python
n = 3
tasks = [[1,6,2],[2,8,4],[3,10,3]]
print(maxTaxiEarnings(n, tasks))  # Output: 17
```

This solution ensures that you maximize the earnings by strategically choosing the non-conflicting rides.
