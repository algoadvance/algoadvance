title:  Remove Sub-Folders from the Filesystem-out
permalink: /s1233
---

Given a list of folders, remove all sub-folders in those folders and return in any order the folders after removing. If a folder `folder[i]` is located within another folder `folder[j]`, it is considered a sub-folder of it.

For example, folder `/a` and `/a/b` will be given as `["/a", "/a/b"]`, and we are expected to return `["/a"]`. Similarly, `["/a/b/c", "/a/b/d", "/a/b/ca", "/a/b/b"]` will be returned as `["/a/b"]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Are the folder paths given in any particular order?
   - Is there a guaranteed unique path? (No duplicates in the input list)

2. **Output Format**:
   - Can the output be in any order or should it follow a certain sequence?

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - What if the input list is empty?
   - What if there's only one folder in the input?

### Code

Here is a Python solution to the problem:

```python
def removeSubfolders(folder):
    # Sort the folder list
    folder.sort()
    
    result = []
    prev = ""
    
    for path in folder:
        # Check if the current path starts with the previous folder path followed by "/"
        if not prev or not path.startswith(prev + '/'):
            result.append(path)
            prev = path
    
    return result
```

### Strategy

1. **Sort the List of Folders**: 
   - Sort the list of folders lexicographically. This ensures that any sub-folder will immediately follow its parent folder. 
   
2. **Iterate through the Sorted List**:
   - Use a variable `prev` to keep track of the last added folder to the result list.
   - For each folder in the sorted list, check if it is a sub-folder of the previous folder in the result list. This can be done by checking if the current folder path starts with the `prev` folder path followed by `/`.
   - If it's not a sub-folder, add it to the result list and update `prev`.

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting**: Sorting the list of folders will take `O(n log n)` time.
2. **Iteration and Substring Check**: Iterating through the list and checking if a path is a sub-folder takes `O(n * k)`, where `k` is the average length of the folder paths.

The overall time complexity is `O(n log n + n * k)`, which simplifies to `O(n log n)` as `log n` dominantes `k` in practical scenarios.
