title:  Match Substring After Replacement-out
permalink: /s2301
---
Given two strings `s` and `sub` and a list of lists `mappings` where each `mappings[i] = [oldChar, newChar]` means you can convert the character `oldChar` to the character `newChar`. Return true if it is possible to replace characters in `sub` so that it becomes a substring of `s`. Return false otherwise.

#### Example
```python
s = "abcd"
sub = "ef"
mappings = [['e', 'a'], ['f', 'b']]
```
Output: True

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can a character in `sub` be replaced more than once if there are multiple mappings pointing to different characters in `s`? 
2. Are the strings `s` and `sub` comprised of only lowercase alphabetical characters?
3. Are the lists in `mappings` guaranteed to contain valid single character 'oldChar' and 'newChar' elements?
4. How large can the input strings and the mappings list be?

### Strategy
To determine if `sub` can be transformed such that it becomes a substring of `s`, we can follow these steps:

1. **Preprocessing the Mappings**: Convert `mappings` into a dictionary for quicker lookup for possible conversions.
2. **Sliding Window Approach**: Using a sliding window of the length of `sub`, check each possible substring of `s` for a potential match.
3. **Match Function**: For each window, check if each character in `sub` can be converted to the corresponding character in the window using the mappings. If one transformation works, break and return True; otherwise, continue.

### Code
Here's the code to solve the problem:

```python
def canTransform(s, sub, mappings):
    # Create a mapping dictionary
    mapping_dict = {}
    for old, new in mappings:
        if old in mapping_dict:
            mapping_dict[old].add(new)
        else:
            mapping_dict[old] = {new}
    
    def can_match(window, sub):
        for i in range(len(sub)):
            if sub[i] != window[i]:
                if sub[i] in mapping_dict and window[i] in mapping_dict[sub[i]]:
                    continue
                else:
                    return False
        return True
    
    n, k = len(s), len(sub)
    
    for i in range(n - k + 1):
        if can_match(s[i:i+k], sub):
            return True
    
    return False

# Example usage
s = "abcd"
sub = "ef"
mappings = [['e', 'a'], ['f', 'b']]
print(canTransform(s, sub, mappings))  # Output: True
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the approach is analyzed as follows:
- **Preprocessing**: Building the `mapping_dict` takes O(m), where m is the number of mappings.
- **Sliding window**: For each possible substring of length `k` in `s` (total n - k + 1 windows), the checking function runs in O(k).
Therefore, the overall complexity is **O((n - k + 1) * k + m)**, which simplifies to **O(n * k + m)**.

This means the solution is efficient enough for reasonably sized inputs.
