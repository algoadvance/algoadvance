title:  Check if Array is Good-out
permalink: /s2784

You are given an array `nums` consisting of distinct positive integers. We call an array "good" if for any two elements `a` and `b` (where `a != b`), the product `a * b` is not present in the array `nums`. Your task is to determine whether the given array is "good".

Write a Python function to check if the array is good.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Size:** Are there any constraints on the size of the input array?
2. **Constraints on Values:** Are the values in `nums` distinct and positive?
3. **Special Cases:** Should we consider the behavior for very small arrays (like arrays with 0 or 1 elements)?

**Assumptions based on common problem constraints:**
- The input array can have up to `10^4` elements.
- All elements in the array are distinct and in the range `[1, 10^9]`.

## Strategy:

1. **Generate All Possible Products:** Given the constraints, generating all pairs and their products would be computationally expensive due to its O(n^2) complexity.
2. **Check Product Presence:** We will use a set to store the values in `nums` for O(1) average time complexity check.
3. **Iterate Over Pairs:** We will iterate over every unique pair `(a, b)` in `nums` and check if `a * b` exists in the set.

## Time Complexity:
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) due to the use of a set to store array elements.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2) due to the nested iteration over pairs of elements.

Letâ€™s implement the solution step by step.

```python
from typing import List

def is_good_array(nums: List[int]) -> bool:
    num_set = set(nums)
    n = len(nums)
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            product = nums[i] * nums[j]
            if product in num_set:
                return False
    return True
```

This code ensures that we iterate over every unique pair of elements in the array, check if their product already exists in the set, and return `False` immediately if it does. If no such product is found, the array is determined to be "good."

## Explanation:
1. **Initialization:** We create a set `num_set` from the list `nums` to allow O(1) time complexity when checking for the presence of elements.
2. **Nested Loop:** We use a nested loop to go through all unique pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` where `i < j`.
3. **Product Check:** For each pair, we calculate the product `nums[i] * nums[j]` and check if it's present in `num_set`.
4. **Return Result:** If any product is found in the set, we return `False`. If we complete the loop without finding any such product, we return `True`.

Considering the potential size of the input and constraints, this approach will efficiently determine if the array is "good."
