title:  Maximum Number of Groups Getting Fresh Donuts-out
permalink: /s1815
---

A donut shop has several boxes of donuts, which they want to serve to customers. The shop wants to serve the maximum number of groups of customers in such a way that every group gets **`fresh donuts`**. Donuts come in several sizes, and they can accommodate donut boxes of multiple sizes, but the sum of the donuts in each group must be a multiple of `batchSize`.

Here is the concise problem statement:
> You are given a positive integer `batchSize` and an array of positive integers `groups`, where `groups[i]` represents the number of donuts in the ith box. Return the maximum number of groups you can serve fresh donuts to, where the sum of donuts in each group is a multiple of `batchSize`.

### Clarifying Questions

Before jumping into the solution, let's clarify a few questions to ensure our understanding:
1. **What should we return if no groups can be served fresh donuts?**
   - Return `0`.
2. **Are all input values positive integers?**
   - Yes, `batchSize` and all elements in `groups` array are positive integers.
3. **What are the constraints on `batchSize` and size of `groups`?**
   - `batchSize` is a positive integer.
   - `groups` array can have length up to `10^4` and elements up to `10^9`.
4. **Can multiple boxes be combined to form a group as long as their sum of donuts is a multiple of `batchSize`?**
   - Yes.

With these clarifications, let's move to the strategy and solution.

### Strategy

1. **Calculate Remainders:** 
   - For each box of donuts, compute the remainder when divided by `batchSize`. This is a key step as it helps in understanding whether the current box can form a `fresh` group by itself or needs to be paired with others.
  
2. **Count Remainders:**
   - Use an array `remainders` where `remainders[i]` keeps track of how many boxes leave a remainder `i` when divided by `batchSize`.
  
3. **Form Groups from Remainders:**
   - Special case for `remainder 0`: Any group that itself is a multiple of `batchSize` can immediately serve fresh donuts.
   - Pair remainders `i` and `batchSize - i` to form new fresh groups.
   - Handle special cases where `batchSize` is even and the remainder is `batchSize / 2`, allowing those to be grouped together specifically.
  
4. **Dynamic Programming or Backtracking:**
   - Use a dynamic approach to try and maximize the number of fresh groups we can form using available boxes.

Let's implement this step-by-step.

### Code

```python
from collections import Counter

def maxHappyGroups(batchSize: int, groups: List[int]) -> int:
    remainder_count = Counter([group % batchSize for group in groups])
    
    # Groups that are already happily batchable
    result = remainder_count[0]
    
    # If the batchSize is even, handle special case for group of size batchSize // 2
    if batchSize % 2 == 0:
        result += remainder_count[batchSize // 2] // 2
        remainder_count[batchSize // 2] %= 2
    
    # Pair remainders i and batchSize - i
    for i in range(1, (batchSize + 1) // 2):
        pair_count = min(remainder_count[i], remainder_count[batchSize - i])
        result += pair_count
        remainder_count[i] -= pair_count
        remainder_count[batchSize - i] -= pair_count
    
    # Remaining groups use a backtracking approach to maximize happiness
    def dfs(remainder_count_tuple):
        if sum(remainder_count_tuple) == 0:
            return 0
        if remainder_count_tuple in memo:
            return memo[remainder_count_tuple]
        
        max_happy = 0
        for i in range(1, batchSize):
            if remainder_count_tuple[i] > 0:
                new_remainder_tuple = list(remainder_count_tuple)
                new_remainder_tuple[i] -= 1
                
                next_remainder = (batchSize - i) % batchSize
                max_happy = max(max_happy, dfs(tuple(new_remainder_tuple)) + (1 if next_remainder == 0 else 0))
        
        memo[remainder_count_tuple] = max_happy
        return max_happy
    
    # Memoization storage for dfs
    memo = {}
    remainder_count_tuple = tuple(remainder_count[i] for i in range(batchSize))

    return result + dfs(remainder_count_tuple)

# Sample call
batchSize, groups = 4, [1,2,3,4,5,6]
print(maxHappyGroups(batchSize, groups))
```

### Time Complexity

- **Input Processing:** \( O(N) \), where \( N \) is the size of the `groups` array for calculating remainders.
- **Pair Matching:** \( O(\frac{batchSize}{2}) \)
- **DFS and Memoization:** Let M be the maximum of `batchSize * (total count)` where total count is significant. Since we use memoization, it ensures no recomputation, making it efficient.

Overall, given the constraints, the solution is optimized to handle large inputs effectively.
