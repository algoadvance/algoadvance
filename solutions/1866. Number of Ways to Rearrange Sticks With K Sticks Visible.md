title:  Number of Ways to Rearrange Sticks With K Sticks Visible-out
permalink: /s1866

You are given an integer `n` representing the number of sticks and an integer `k` representing the number of visible sticks. You are required to calculate the number of ways to rearrange the sticks in a line such that exactly `k` sticks are visible. A stick is visible if there are no sticks of greater height in front of it.

Return the number of such rearrangements. Since the result can be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of `n` and `k`?**
   - `1 <= k <= n <= 1000`
   
2. **Is the answer expected to be very large?**
   - Yes, hence the result should be returned modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Strategy
This problem requires dynamic programming to efficiently compute the number of arrangements. Let's use a 2D DP table `dp` where `dp[n][k]` represents the number of ways to rearrange `n` sticks such that exactly `k` sticks are visible.

#### Dynamic Programming Transition
1. If the tallest stick is visible, it must be placed in the first position. Then, we need `k-1` sticks visible out of the remaining `n-1` sticks.
2. If the tallest stick is not visible, it can be placed in any of the remaining `n-1` positions, reducing the problem to `n-1` sticks but still needing `k` visible sticks.

The recurrence relation can be formulated as:
\[ dp[n][k] = (dp[n-1][k-1] + (n-1) \times dp[n-1][k]) \mod 10^9 + 7 \]

#### Base Case
- `dp[0][0] = 1`: There's one way to rearrange zero sticks with zero visible.

### Code

```python
def rearrangeSticks(n, k):
    MOD = 10**9 + 7

    # Create a 2D DP array with dimensions (n+1) x (k+1)
    dp = [[0] * (k + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    # Base case
    dp[0][0] = 1

    # Fill the table using the recurrence relation
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, k + 1):
            dp[i][j] = (dp[i-1][j-1] + (i-1) * dp[i-1][j]) % MOD
    
    return dp[n][k]

# Example Usage:
print(rearrangeSticks(3, 2))  # Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity: O(n * k)**: We fill an `n x k` DP table.
- **Space Complexity: O(n * k)**: We use a DP table of size `(n+1) x (k+1)` to store the results.

This solution is efficient and should handle the given constraints (`1 <= k <= n <= 1000`) properly.
