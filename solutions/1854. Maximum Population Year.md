title:  Maximum Population Year-out

You are given a 2D integer array `logs` where each `logs[i] = [birthi, deathi]` indicates the birth and death years of the `i-th` person.

The population of some year `x` is the number of people alive during that year. The `i-th` person is counted in the population of year `x` if `x` is in the inclusive range `[birthi, deathi - 1]`. Note that the person is not counted in the death year.

Return the year with the maximum population.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of Years:** What is the possible range of years we are dealing with? 
    - Typically, the constraints might be from, e.g., 1950 to 2050.
2. **Length and Values of Logs:** What is the expected range of values for `logs` and how long can it be?
    - This helps ascertain the upper limits on performance and storage.

## Strategy
We will use a strategy involving a difference array to determine the population changes efficiently:

1. **Create an Array for Population Changes:**
    - Mark every birth year with a +1 and every death year with a -1. Note that the death year should decrement the next year, because the person is not counted in the death year.
  
2. **Calculate Prefix Sum:**
    - Use a prefix sum approach to find out the number of people alive in each year.

3. **Determine the Maximum Population Year:**
    - Traverse the prefix sum array to find the year with the highest population.

### Steps in Detail

1. Initialize an array, `population_changes`, to track changes in population for each year.
2. Loop through the `logs` and apply the changes to this array.
3. Compute the prefix sum of the `population_changes` array.
4. Find the year with the maximum population from the prefix sum array.

## Code

```python
def maxPopulationYear(logs):
    # Define the range based on typical constraints (assuming 1950 to 2050)
    start_year = 1950
    end_year = 2051
    num_years = end_year - start_year
    
    # Array to store population changes
    population_changes = [0] * num_years
    
    # Apply population changes at birth and just after death
    for birth, death in logs:
        population_changes[birth - start_year] += 1
        if death < end_year:
            population_changes[death - start_year] -= 1
            
    # Use prefix sum to compute population for each year
    max_population = 0
    current_population = 0
    max_year = start_year
    
    for year in range(num_years):
        current_population += population_changes[year]
        if current_population > max_population:
            max_population = current_population
            max_year = start_year + year
    
    return max_year

# Example usage
logs = [[1993,1999], [2000,2010], [1975,2005], [1970,1982], [1980,2040], [1950,1961]]
print(maxPopulationYear(logs))  # Output should be a year with maximum population
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Initialization and Array Operations:** O(Y), where Y is the range of years (e.g., 101 for 1950 to 2050).
2. **Processing Logs:** O(N), where N is the number of logs.
3. **Prefix Sum Calculation:** O(Y), where Y is again the range of years.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(N + Y), which is efficient given that typically Y (number of years) is fixed and relatively small.
