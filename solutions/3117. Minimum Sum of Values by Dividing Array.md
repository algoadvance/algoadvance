title:  Minimum Sum of Values by Dividing Array-out
permalink: /s3117
---

You are given an array of integers where each element represents the count of a certain type of item. You need to divide these items into two groups such that the absolute difference between the sums of the two groups is minimized. Return the minimum possible absolute difference.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range and Constraints:**
   - What is the range of the values in the array?
   - What is the maximum length of the array?

2. **Nature of the Problem:**
   - Can the array contain negative values?
   - Are there any constraints on the sum of the elements in the array?

3. **Output Requirements:**
   - Should the function return the absolute minimum difference?

### Strategy

This problem can be related to the **Partition Problem**, which is a well-known NP-complete problem often approached using dynamic programming.

**Dynamic Programming Strategy:**

1. **State Representation:**
   - Use a boolean DP array `dp` where `dp[j]` is `True` if a subset with sum `j` can be achieved, otherwise `False`.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize `dp[0]` as `True` because a sum of 0 is always achievable with an empty subset.

3. **State Transition:**
   - For each element in the array, update the DP array from the back to avoid recomputing using the same element multiple times.
   - For each possible sum `j` from the total sum down to the current element.

4. **Final Computation for Minimum Difference:**
   - Calculate the total sum of the array.
   - Find the largest `j` (`<= total_sum // 2`) for which `dp[j]` is `True`.
   - The minimum difference is computed as `total_sum - 2 * j`.

### Code

```python
def minDifference(nums):
    total_sum = sum(nums)
    n = len(nums)
    
    dp = [False] * (total_sum + 1)
    dp[0] = True
    
    for num in nums:
        for j in range(total_sum, num - 1, -1):
            dp[j] = dp[j] or dp[j - num]
    
    for j in range(total_sum // 2, -1, -1):
        if dp[j]:
            return total_sum - 2 * j

# Example Usage:
nums = [1, 6, 11, 5]
print(minDifference(nums))  # Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n * total_sum)`
  - Where `n` is the length of the array and `total_sum` is the sum of the elements in the array.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(total_sum)`
  - Space is used for the DP array to keep track of reachable sums.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum possible absolute difference based on the partitioning of the array.
