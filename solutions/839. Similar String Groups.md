title:  Similar String Groups-out
permalink: /s839
---

We are given a list of strings `strs`. Two strings `X` and `Y` are considered similar if we can swap two letters (in different positions) of `X` to get `Y`. Also, two strings `X` and `Y` are considered similar if they are equal.

We need to determine the number of groups of similar strings in the provided list `strs`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on `strs` and its elements?**
   - Typically, `strs` will contain a maximum of few thousand strings but actual constraints must be checked from the problem explicitly. Let's assume reasonable constraints for a coding interview.
   
2. **Length of the strings?**
   - All strings in `strs` are the same length.
   
3. **Character set?**
   - Usually consists of lowercase English letters (a-z).

4. **Output requirement?**
   - A single integer representing the number of groups of similar strings.

## Strategy

### Approach

This problem can be modeled as a graph problem. 

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Each string is a node.
   - Thereâ€™s an edge between two nodes if the corresponding strings are similar.

2. **Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) Algorithm:**
   - Union-Find can help efficiently group nodes and find the number of such groups (connected components).
  
### Steps to Implement

1. **Initialize Union-Find data structure:**
   - With a `parent` array where `parent[i]` refers to the parent of node `i`.
   - A `rank` array to keep the tree flat for efficiency.

2. **Helper Function to Check Similarity:**
   - Count positional differences and ensure there are at most 2 differences between the characters of the two strings.

3. **Process Each Pair:**
   - Traverse every pair of strings and union them if they are similar.

4. **Count the Number of Groups:**
   - Use the Union-Find parent array to find the number of unique parents, which represents the number of distinct groups.

### Time Complexity

- **Similarity Check:** O(m) per comparison where m is the string length.
- **Union-Find Operations:** Nearly constant time due to path compression and rank technique.
- **Overall Complexity:** O(n^2 * m) where n is the number of strings and m the length of each string.

## Code

```python
class UnionFind:
    def __init__(self, size):
        self.parent = list(range(size))
        self.rank = [1] * size
    
    def find(self, x):
        if self.parent[x] != x:
            self.parent[x] = self.find(self.parent[x])
        return self.parent[x]
    
    def union(self, x, y):
        rootX = self.find(x)
        rootY = self.find(y)
        
        if rootX != rootY:
            if self.rank[rootX] > self.rank[rootY]:
                self.parent[rootY] = rootX
            elif self.rank[rootX] < self.rank[rootY]:
                self.parent[rootX] = rootY
            else:
                self.parent[rootY] = rootX
                self.rank[rootX] += 1

def are_similar(s1, s2):
    diff = 0
    for a, b in zip(s1, s2):
        if a != b:
            diff += 1
            if diff > 2:
                return False
    return True

def numSimilarGroups(strs):
    n = len(strs)
    uf = UnionFind(n)
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if are_similar(strs[i], strs[j]):
                uf.union(i, j)
    
    groups = set()
    for i in range(n):
        groups.add(uf.find(i))
    
    return len(groups)

# Example Usage
strs = ["tars", "rats", "arts", "star"]
print(numSimilarGroups(strs))  # Output should be 2
```

This solution uses the Union-Find data structure to efficiently manage and find groups of similar strings, leveraging path compression and union by rank to maintain optimal performance.
