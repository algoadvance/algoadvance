title:  Construct K Palindrome Strings-out
permalink: /s1400
---

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You should construct `k` non-empty palindrome strings using all the characters in `s`.

Return `True` if you can use all the characters in `s` to construct `k` palindrome strings or `False` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

Before we proceed to the solution, let's clarify a few points to make sure the problem is well-understood:
1. **Input Constraints**: What are the constraints on the length of `s` and the value of `k`?
2. **Character Repetition**: Can characters in `s` repeat, and if so, how should that be managed in palindrome formation?
3. **Edge Cases**: What should be returned if `k` is greater than the length of `s`? (This should directly return `False` since we can't split into more palindromes than the number of characters)
4. **Empty String**: What should be the behavior when `s` is an empty string?

### Strategy

To determine if it's possible to construct `k` palindrome strings using the characters of `s`, let's consider the following points:

1. **Count Characters**: First, we need to count the frequency of each character in `s`.
2. **Odd Frequency Characters**: For a string to be a palindrome, at most one character can have an odd frequency (in the case of odd-length palindromes). For multiple palindromes:
   - Each palindrome can have one odd frequency character at most in the center.
   - The number of characters that have an odd frequency should not exceed `k` because each odd frequency character will be the center of a different palindrome.
3. **Minimum Required Palindromes**: The minimum number of palindromes required to use all characters would be dictated by the number of characters with odd frequencies.

### Code

Based on this strategy, here's how we can implement this in Python:

```python
def canConstruct(s: str, k: int) -> bool:
    from collections import Counter
    
    # Case when k is more than the length of the string
    if k > len(s):
        return False
    
    # Count the frequency of each character
    char_count = Counter(s)
    
    # Count the number of characters that have an odd frequency
    odd_count = sum(1 for count in char_count.values() if count % 2 != 0)
    
    # We need at least `odd_count` palindromes, and we cannot have more than `k` palindromes
    return odd_count <= k

# Test cases to verify the solution
assert(canConstruct("annabelle", 2) == True)
assert(canConstruct("leetcode", 3) == False)
assert(canConstruct("true", 4) == True)
assert(canConstruct("yzyzyzyzyzyzyzy", 2) == True)
assert(canConstruct("cr", 7) == False)
```

### Time Complexity

- **Counting Characters**: O(n), where n is the length of `s`.
- **Counting Odd Frequency Characters**: O(1), since there are at most 26 letters in the English alphabet.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n). The additional space complexity is also O(1) if we consider the space used by the character frequencies (which can be fixed to 26 English letters).

This solution efficiently determines whether it is possible to construct the desired number of palindrome strings with the given conditions.
