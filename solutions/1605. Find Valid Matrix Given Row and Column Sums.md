title:  Find Valid Matrix Given Row and Column Sums-out
permalink: /s1605
---
You are given two arrays `rowSum` and `colSum` of non-negative integers where `rowSum[i]` is the sum of the elements in the `i-th` row and `colSum[j]` is the sum of the elements in the `j-th` column of a 2D matrix. Your task is to find any matrix of non-negative integers that satisfies the given `rowSum` and `colSum` requirements.

Return any matrix that meets the criteria. It is guaranteed an answer exists.

Example:
```
Input: rowSum = [3, 8], colSum = [4, 7]
Output: [[3, 0],
         [1, 7]]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Size of rowSum and colSum:** Are `rowSum` and `colSum` of equal lengths?
    - No, `rowSum` and `colSum` can be of different lengths. `rowSum` has the length of the number of rows and `colSum` of the number of columns.
2. **Non-negative constraints:** Are the values in `rowSum` and `colSum` guaranteed to be non-negative?
    - Yes, the values are non-negative integers.
3. **Unique solution:** Is there a unique solution or can there be multiple valid matrices?
    - There can be multiple valid solutions, any valid matrix can be returned.

## Strategy
To construct a valid matrix based on the given `rowSum` and `colSum`, a greedy approach can be used:
1. Initialize a matrix of zeros with dimensions `len(rowSum) x len(colSum)`.
2. Start filling the matrix from the top-left element to the bottom-right.
3. For each cell `(i, j)`:
   - Determine the minimum value between the current `rowSum` and `colSum` values.
   - Place this minimum value in the cell.
   - Subtract this value from both the `rowSum` and `colSum`.
4. Move to the next cell and repeat until all `rowSum` and `colSum` values are satisfied.

This approach ensures that each row and column contributes to their respective sums without exceeding the specified constraints.

## Code
```python
def restoreMatrix(rowSum, colSum):
    rows, cols = len(rowSum), len(colSum)
    matrix = [[0] * cols for _ in range(rows)]
    
    for i in range(rows):
        for j in range(cols):
            # Determine the value to place in matrix[i][j]
            min_value = min(rowSum[i], colSum[j])
            matrix[i][j] = min_value
            
            # Deduct the min_value from respective rowSum and colSum
            rowSum[i] -= min_value
            colSum[j] -= min_value
            
    return matrix

# Example Usage:
rowSum = [3, 8]
colSum = [4, 7]
print(restoreMatrix(rowSum, colSum))
```

## Time Complexity
- **Initialization of matrix:** O(m * n)
- **Filling the matrix:** O(m * n)

Where `m` is the length of `rowSum` and `n` is the length of `colSum`. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(m * n).
