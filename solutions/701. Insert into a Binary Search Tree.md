title:  Insert into a Binary Search Tree-out
permalink: /s701
---

You are given the root node of a Binary Search Tree (BST) and a value to insert into the tree. Insert the value into the BST in such a way that the resulting tree remains a valid BST. Return the root node of the BST after the insertion. It is guaranteed that the new value does not exist in the original BST.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Are duplicates allowed in the BST?
   **A**: No, the problem guarantees that the new value does not exist in the original BST.
   
2. **Q**: Can the input tree be empty?
   **A**: Yes, the tree can be empty, in which case the new value should become the root node.

3. **Q**: Should we consider balancing the BST with this insertion?
   **A**: No, the problem does not require keeping the tree balanced, just that it remains a valid BST.

4. **Q**: Is the tree guaranteed to be a valid BST before insertion?
   **A**: Yes, the tree given will be a valid BST.

### Strategy

To insert a value into a BST:
1. If the tree is empty, the new value will become the root node.
2. Starting from the root, compare the new value with the current node value:
   - If the new value is smaller, move to the left subtree.
   - If the new value is greater, move to the right subtree.
3. Insert the new value in the appropriate position when you find a null node.

### Code

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def insertIntoBST(root: TreeNode, val: int) -> TreeNode:
    if root is None:
        return TreeNode(val)

    current = root
    while True:
        if val < current.val:
            if current.left is None:
                current.left = TreeNode(val)
                break
            else:
                current = current.left
        else:  # val > current.val because duplicates are not allowed
            if current.right is None:
                current.right = TreeNode(val)
                break
            else:
                current = current.right
                
    return root
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(H)**, where **H** is the height of the BST. In the average case, the height of the BST is **O(log N)**, where **N** is the number of nodes, but in the worst case (when the tree is skewed), the height can be **O(N)**. Therefore, the time complexity ranges from **O(log N)** to **O(N)** depending on the structure of the tree.
