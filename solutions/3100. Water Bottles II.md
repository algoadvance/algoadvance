title:  Water Bottles II-out
permalink: /s3100

You are given two integers `numBottles` and `numExchange`:

- `numBottles`: The initial number of full water bottles.
- `numExchange`: The number of empty bottles you can exchange for one full bottle.

You want to maximize the total number of water bottles you can drink. Return the maximum number of water bottles you can drink.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What happens when you do not have enough empty bottles to make an exchange?
   - Once you cannot make an exchange due to lacking enough empty bottles, you cannot drink any more water.
2. Are the empty bottles from the exchanged full bottles immediately available for the next exchange?
   - Yes, the empty bottles you get from drinking can be used for the next exchange.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to simulate the process iteratively. Initially, you drink all the bottles you have. Then, we calculate how many new full bottles we can get by exchanging the empty bottles and add them to the remaining empty bottles. This process continues until we can no longer exchange any empty bottles for full ones.

We'll:
1. Initialize total_bottles with `numBottles`.
2. Initialize `current_bottles` with `numBottles`.
3. Use a loop to:
   - Drink all current bottles, adding to the total count of bottles.
   - Calculate the new full bottles from the current empty bottles.
   - Update the number of current bottles and remaining empty bottles.
4. The loop stops when no more bottles can be exchanged.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(log(numBottles)) because, in each loop iteration, the number of bottles we can exchange reduces substantially if `numExchange` is greater than 1.

### Code
```python
def numWaterBottles(numBottles: int, numExchange: int) -> int:
    total_bottles = numBottles
    current_bottles = numBottles
    
    while current_bottles >= numExchange:
        new_bottles = current_bottles // numExchange
        remain_bottles = current_bottles % numExchange
        total_bottles += new_bottles
        current_bottles = new_bottles + remain_bottles

    return total_bottles

# Example usage:
# print(numWaterBottles(9, 3)) # Output: 13
```

This code snippet initializes the total number of bottles you can drink with the initial count and iteratively computes the new bottles you can obtain through exchanges, updating the total count and the number of current bottles each time, until no more exchanges can be made.
