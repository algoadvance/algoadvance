title:  First Bad Version-out
permalink: /s278
---

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions [1, 2, ..., n], and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which returns whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

#### Example:
```
Input: n = 5, bad = 4
Output: 4
Explanation:
call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true
Then 4 is the first bad version.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - Typically, `n` can be quite large, say up to \(2^{31} - 1\).
   
2. **Are the versions numbered sequentially starting from 1 up to n?**
   - Yes, versions are sequentially numbered from 1 to n.

3. **Can the `isBadVersion` API call be costly?**
   - Yes, the main goal is to minimize the number of API calls, suggesting `isBadVersion` might be costly.

### Strategy

To find the first bad version efficiently, we can use a Binary Search algorithm. This approach helps in reducing the number of `isBadVersion` API calls by dividing the search space in half each time.

### Binary Search Approach

1. **Initialization:** 
   - Use two pointers, `left` starting at 1 and `right` starting at n.

2. **Binary Search:**
   - Calculate the middle point `mid`.
   - If `isBadVersion(mid)` is `true`, then the first bad version must be `mid` or to the left of `mid`, so we move the `right` pointer to `mid`.
   - If `isBadVersion(mid)` is `false`, then we move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1` to search the right half.

3. **Termination:**
   - The loop repeats until `left` meets `right`, at which point `left` will be at the position of the first bad version.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of the binary search approach is \(O(\log n)\), which is very efficient compared to a linear scan \(O(n)\).

### Code Implementation
Here is the implementation in Python:

```python
def firstBadVersion(n):
    left, right = 1, n
    
    while left < right:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2
        
        if isBadVersion(mid):
            right = mid  # mid might be the first bad version
        else:
            left = mid + 1  # mid is definitely not the first bad version
    
    return left  # or right, since left == right
```

### Final Notes
- The implementation assumes that `isBadVersion` is already defined or provided in the environment.
- The binary search ensures that we zero in on the first bad version efficiently, minimizing the number of calls to `isBadVersion`.
