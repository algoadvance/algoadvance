[Leetcode 17. Letter Combinations of a Phone Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l17)
## Problem Statement

Given a string containing digits from 2-9 inclusive, return all possible letter combinations that the number could represent. A mapping of digit to letters (just like on the telephone buttons) is given below. Note that 1 does not map to any letters.

    2 -> "abc"
    3 -> "def"
    4 -> "ghi"
    5 -> "jkl"
    6 -> "mno"
    7 -> "pqrs"
    8 -> "tuv"
    9 -> "wxyz"

The input is a string that contains digits ranging from 2 to 9. You need to return all possible letter combinations you can get by pressing these started next number of buttons.

### Example:
```
Input: "23"
Output: ["ad", "ae", "af", "bd", "be", "bf", "cd", "ce", "cf"]
```

### Note:
Although the above answer is in lexicographical order, your answer could be in any order you want.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What to do with invalid input like an empty string or digits outside the range 2-9?**
   - An empty string should return an empty list of combinations.
  
2. **Is the order of the resulting combinations important?**
   - No, the order of the resulting combinations is not important.

3. **Is there a limit on the length of the input string?**
   - Typically, constraints like these are not explicitly stated, but the length of the input will generally be reasonably small, making it manageable within common constraints (length <= 10).

## Strategy

1. **Mapping Digits to Letters**: Create a mapping from digits to their corresponding letters.
2. **Backtracking Technique**: Use a backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations. This is suitable for problems where we need to explore all potential configurations.
3. **Recursive Function**: Write a recursive function that:
   - Takes the current combination and the next digit to process.
   - Adds each possible letter for that digit to the current combination.
   - Recursively proceeds to process subsequent digits.
4. **Base Case**: If all digits are processed, add the current combination to the list of results.

## Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    
    private static final String[] KEYPAD = {
        "",     // 0
        "",     // 1
        "abc",  // 2
        "def",  // 3
        "ghi",  // 4
        "jkl",  // 5
        "mno",  // 6
        "pqrs", // 7
        "tuv",  // 8
        "wxyz"  // 9
    };

    public List<String> letterCombinations(String digits) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        if (digits == null || digits.length() == 0) {
            return result;
        }
        
        backtrack(result, new StringBuilder(), digits, 0);
        return result;
    }

    private void backtrack(List<String> result, StringBuilder current, String digits, int index) {
        if (index == digits.length()) {
            result.add(current.toString());
            return;
        }
        
        String letters = KEYPAD[digits.charAt(index) - '0'];
        for (char letter : letters.toCharArray()) {
            current.append(letter);
            backtrack(result, current, digits, index + 1);
            current.deleteCharAt(current.length() - 1); // backtrack
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        String digits = "23";
        List<String> combinations = solution.letterCombinations(digits);
        for (String combination : combinations) {
            System.out.println(combination);
        }
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(3^N * 4^M), where N is the number of digits corresponding to 3 letters (2-6, 8) and M is the number of digits corresponding to 4 letters (7, 9).

- **N digits**: Each of these digits can map to 3 letters.
- **M digits**: Each of these digits can map to 4 letters.

The recursive backtracking approach explores all possible combinations formed by these letters.

- **Space Complexity**: O(3^N * 4^M) for storing the result list of combinations. The recursion depth will be O(N+M).
