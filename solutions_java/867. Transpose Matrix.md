[Leetcode 867. Transpose Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l867)
## Problem Statement

Given a 2D integer array `matrix`, return the transpose of `matrix`.

The transpose of a matrix is the matrix flipped over its main diagonal, switching the matrix's row and column indices.

For example, the transpose of a matrix:

```
[
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9]
]
```

is

```
[
  [1,4,7],
  [2,5,8],
  [3,6,9]
]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: Are the elements of the matrix bounded by any value range?
    - There are no specific constraints provided, so we can assume they are integers within a typical range.
    
2. **Matrix Size**: Can the matrix be non-square (i.e., different number of rows and columns)?
    - Yes, the matrix can be non-square.

3. **Edge Cases**: Can the input matrix be empty or contain a single element?
    - The matrix can contain any form of input that is within the problem's constraints. An empty matrix would be an edge case to handle.

## Strategy

1. **Create a New Matrix**: Initialize a new matrix `transpose` with the dimensions swapped â€” if the original matrix is `m x n`, the new matrix will be `n x m`.

2. **Iterate and Assign Values**: Iterate over the original matrix, and for each element at position `(i,j)`, place it in the new matrix at position `(j,i)`.

3. **Return Result**: Return the newly created transposed matrix.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int[][] transpose(int[][] matrix) {
        int m = matrix.length;
        int n = matrix[0].length;
        int[][] transpose = new int[n][m];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                transpose[j][i] = matrix[i][j];
            }
        }
        
        return transpose;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n)
  - We iterate over every element of the `m x n` matrix once, making a single operation for each. Thus, the complexity is proportional to the number of elements in the matrix.

- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n)
  - The space complexity is also O(m * n) because we are creating a new matrix of the same number of elements as the input matrix but with swapped dimensions.
