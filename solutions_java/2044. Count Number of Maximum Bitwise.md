[Leetcode 2044. Count Number of Maximum Bitwise](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2044)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, find the number of non-empty **subsets** whose **Bitwise OR** is **maximum**.

A **subset** of an array is a selection of elements (possibly none) of the array such that their order is preserved. The **bitwise OR** of a subset is the bitwise OR of all elements in it.

Return the **number of subsets** with the **maximum** bitwise OR.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the elements in the `nums` array?**
   - According to the problem, assume typical integer values as per normal constraints in related problems unless specified otherwise.

2. **What is the size range of the input array `nums`?**
   - The length can be up to 16 given typical constraints for such problems to keep our approach feasible.

3. **Are there negative integers in the input array?**
   - Generally, what makes sense for this type of problem is to consider non-negative integers.

Given the clarities letâ€™s move to the solution.

## Strategy

1. **Calculate the Maximum Bitwise OR:**
   - First, iterate through the array to calculate the maximum bitwise OR value possible from any subset.
   
2. **Count the Subsets Matching Maximum Bitwise OR:**
   - Use a recursive approach or bit-manipulation to generate all subsets and count those whose bitwise OR equals the maximum value found.

### Steps:

1. Initialize `max_or` to track the maximum Bitwise OR encountered.
2. For each subset, calculate its Bitwise OR:
   - You can use bit manipulation to generate each subset.
3. Count how many subsets yield this maximum bitwise OR value.
4. Return the count.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int countMaxOrSubsets(int[] nums) {
        int maxOr = 0;
        // Calculate the maximum possible OR value
        for (int num : nums) {
            maxOr |= num;
        }
        
        return countSubsets(nums, 0, 0, maxOr);
    }
    
    private int countSubsets(int[] nums, int index, int currentOr, int maxOr) {
        if (index == nums.length) {
            return currentOr == maxOr ? 1 : 0;
        }
        
        // Decision to include nums[index]
        int include = countSubsets(nums, index + 1, currentOr | nums[index], maxOr);
        
        // Decision to exclude nums[index]
        int exclude = countSubsets(nums, index + 1, currentOr, maxOr);
        
        // Return count of both decisions
        return include + exclude;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {3, 1};
        System.out.println(sol.countMaxOrSubsets(nums)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**
  - The overall complexity is \(O(2^n \cdot n)\), where `n` is the number of elements in the input array.
  - Generating subsets takes \(2^n\), and calculating the OR operation on each subset might take \(O(n)\) time in the worst case.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the stack space required for the recursion.

Given the constraints, this approach should be efficient.
