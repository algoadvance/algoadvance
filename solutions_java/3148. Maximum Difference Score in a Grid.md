[Leetcode 3148. Maximum Difference Score in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3148)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D grid `grid` of size `m x n` where each cell is in the range `[1, 10^9]`, and you are asked to find the maximum difference between any two values in different rows. Specifically, you need to select one element from each row such that the difference between the maximum and the minimum of the selected elements is maximized.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: Can `m` and `n` be very large, for example up to 1000?
2. **Constraints on Elements**: Are all elements guaranteed to be within the given range `[1, 10^9]`?
3. **Output Format**: Should the output be a single integer representing the maximum difference?
4. **Row Uniqueness**: Is it guaranteed that all rows have unique values, or can there be duplicate values in the same row?

### Strategy

To maximize the difference between selected elements, we can use a greedy approach:
1. For each row, identify the minimum and maximum elements.
2. Keep track of the global minimum and global maximum across all rows.
3. Compute the difference between the global maximum and global minimum, which will be the maximum difference possible.

### Code

```java
public class MaxDifferenceScore {

    public static int maxDifference(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        
        int globalMin = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int globalMax = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            int rowMin = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            int rowMax = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
            
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] < rowMin) {
                    rowMin = grid[i][j];
                }
                if (grid[i][j] > rowMax) {
                    rowMax = grid[i][j];
                }
            }
            
            if (rowMin < globalMin) {
                globalMin = rowMin;
            }
            if (rowMax > globalMax) {
                globalMax = rowMax;
            }
        }
        
        return globalMax - globalMin;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] grid = {
            {1, 2, 3},
            {4, 5, 6},
            {7, 8, 9}
        };
        
        System.out.println(maxDifference(grid)); // Output: 8
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(m \times n)\), where \(m\) is the number of rows and \(n\) is the number of columns:
- We iterate over each row and each column to find the minimum and maximum in \(O(n)\) operations per row.
- The overall operations will be \(m \times n\).

### Explanation

- **Outer Loop**: Iterates through each row in the grid.
- **Inner Loop**: Iterates through each column within the current row to find the rowâ€™s minimum and maximum values.
- We keep updating the global minimum and maximum values encountered.
- Finally, the difference between the global maximum and the global minimum is returned as the result.
