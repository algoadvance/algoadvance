[Leetcode 2530. Maximal Score After Applying K Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2530)
## Problem Statement

Given a list of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, you need to maximize your score by performing exactly `k` operations. In one operation, you select one element from `nums`, remove it from the list, and add the square root of that element back into the list (rounding down to the nearest integer). Your task is to determine the maximal possible score after `k` operations, where the score is the sum of all elements in the final list.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the list `nums` contain negative numbers?
   - No, the list will only contain non-negative integers as per the problem constraints.

2. Can k be larger than the number of elements in the list?
   - No, it is guaranteed that `k` will be less than or equal to the number of elements in `nums`.

3. What is the maximum size of `nums` and value of `k`?
   - We need to assume that both can be very large, but efficiently handle common constraints like up to 10^5 elements and operations.

## Strategy
To maximize the score, we need to iteratively replace the highest value element with its square root (rounded down). Here's the step-by-step strategy:

1. Use a max-heap (priority queue) to always extract the maximum element efficiently.
2. Perform `k` operations:
    - Extract the maximum element.
    - Add its value to the score.
    - Insert the integer square root of this element back into the heap.
3. Sum all elements in the heap to get the final score.

## Code
Let's implement this strategy in Java.

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;
import java.util.Collections;

public class MaximalScore {
    public int maxScoreAfterKOperations(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Create a max-heap using PriorityQueue
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        
        // Add all elements to the max-heap
        for (int num : nums) {
            maxHeap.offer(num);
        }
        
        int score = 0;
        
        // Perform k operations
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            // Get the maximum element
            int maxElement = maxHeap.poll();
            // Add the maximum element to the score
            score += maxElement;
            // Compute the integer square root of the max element
            int sqrtMaxElement = (int) Math.floor(Math.sqrt(maxElement));
            // Add the square root back to the max-heap
            maxHeap.offer(sqrtMaxElement);
        }
        
        // Sum all remaining elements in the heap
        while (!maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
            score += maxHeap.poll();
        }
        
        return score;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximalScore solution = new MaximalScore();
        int[] nums = {10, 20, 7};
        int k = 2;
        System.out.println(solution.maxScoreAfterKOperations(nums, k));  // Output expected: 45
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution involves:
1. Building the max-heap from the initial list of numbers: \(O(n \log n)\)
2. Performing `k` extraction and insertion operations from the heap: \(O(k \log n)\)
3. The final summation step involves emptying the heap: \(O(n \log n)\)
Thus, the total time complexity is \(O(n \log n + k \log n)\).

Overall, this approach is efficient for large `n` and moderate `k`.
