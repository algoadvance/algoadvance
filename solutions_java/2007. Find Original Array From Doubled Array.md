[Leetcode 2007. Find Original Array From Doubled Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2007)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `changed`, which is a doubled array where `changed` is formed by taking an original array and appending twice each value in the original array in any order. You need to return the original array if it exists, or an empty array if it does not.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of numbers in the array `changed`?**
   - The numbers are non-negative integers.

2. **Can we have negative or duplicate numbers in the `changed` array?**
   - No, `changed` will only contain non-negative integers, but duplicates can exist.

3. **What is the size of the input array `changed`?**
   - The size of the input array `changed` will be even.

### Strategy

1. **Check length**: If the length of `changed` is odd, immediately return an empty array since it can't be a valid doubled array.
   
2. **Sort `changed`**: Sorting helps in ensuring that when looking for double values, the original values are processed before their doubled values.

3. **Use a HashMap**: Use a map to count occurrences of each number in the `changed` array.

4. **Iterate through sorted array**: For each number in the sorted array, check if it is available in the map. If it is, check for its double. If the double exists in the map, decrease the count for both numbers. Otherwise, return an empty array indicating it's not possible to form an original array.

5. **Return the results**: If successful, the map entries should consistently be reduced to zero, and the collected original array is returned.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int[] findOriginalArray(int[] changed) {
        if (changed.length % 2 != 0) {
            return new int[0]; // If length is odd, it's not possible
        }
        
        Arrays.sort(changed);
        Map<Integer, Integer> countMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Fill the count map with frequency of each number
        for (int num : changed) {
            countMap.put(num, countMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        List<Integer> original = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int num : changed) {
            if (countMap.get(num) == 0) {
                continue; // If the number is already used up in pairings
            }
            
            if (countMap.getOrDefault(num * 2, 0) == 0) {
                return new int[0]; // If there isn't any double of this number left
            }
            
            original.add(num);
            countMap.put(num, countMap.get(num) - 1);
            countMap.put(num * 2, countMap.get(num * 2) - 1);
        }
        
        int[] originalArray = new int[original.size()];
        for (int i = 0; i < original.size(); i++) {
            originalArray[i] = original.get(i);
        }
        
        return originalArray;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting the array**: This takes \(O(n \log n)\) time.
2. **Filling the hashmap**: This takes \(O(n)\) time.
3. **Iterating through the sorted array and updating the hashmap**: This takes \(O(n)\) time.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

This solution should efficiently handle the problem while ensuring correctness.
