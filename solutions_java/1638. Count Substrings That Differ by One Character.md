[Leetcode 1638. Count Substrings That Differ by One Character](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1638)
### Problem Statement
Given two strings `s` and `t`, you want to find the number of non-empty substrings in `s` and `t` that differ by exactly one character. Formally, a substring `s[l..r]` differs by one character from a substring `t[i..j]` if and only if:
- `l - r = i - j` and
- `s[l] != t[i]` and
- `s[l+1, ..., r] == t[i+1, ..., j]`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input constraints**:
   - What is the maximum length of the strings `s` and `t`? 
     - Typically in LeetCode problems, unless stated otherwise, strings do not exceed 1000 characters.
   
2. **Substring definition**:
   - Is the substring length fixed? 
     - No, the problem requires checking various lengths of substrings.
   
3. **Difference count**:
   - Is the difference allowed only for exactly one character, and should other characters be exactly the same?
     - Yes, only one character can differ while the rest is exactly the same.

### Strategy
1. **Iterate through substrings**:
   - Generate all possible substrings of `s` and `t`.
   - Compare each pair of substrings to check if they differ by exactly one character.
   
2. **Efficient comparison**:
   - Use nested loops to iterate through starting positions and lengths of substrings for both `s` and `t`.
   - Count the number of mismatches:
     - Proceed only if there is exactly one mismatch.
   
3. **Optimization consideration**:
   - Instead of generating all pairs of substrings naively, apply direct comparison to reduce redundant operations.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int countSubstrings(String s, String t) {
        int count = 0;
        int n = s.length();
        int m = t.length();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                int mismatch = 0;
                
                for (int k = 0; i + k < n && j + k < m; k++) {
                    if (s.charAt(i + k) != t.charAt(j + k)) {
                        mismatch++;
                    }
                    
                    if (mismatch == 1) {
                        count++;
                    } else if (mismatch > 1) {
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Traverse `s` and `t`**:
   - Use two nested loops to get the start positions `i` and `j` of the substrings.
   
2. **Check substrings**:
   - Use another loop to compare characters of substrings starting at `i` in `s` and `j` in `t`.
   - Count mismatched characters and break the loop if mismatches exceed one.
   
3. **Count valid substrings**:
   - Increase the count when there is exactly one mismatch.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * m * min(n, m))`
   - Outer loops iterate over all possible starting positions pairs `(i, j)` leading to `O(n * m)`.
   - The inner loop iterates for the possible length of substrings leading to an average time of `min(n, m)`.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
   - Constant extra space used for counting mismatches and basic variables.
