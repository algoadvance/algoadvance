[Leetcode 383. Ransom Note](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l383)
### Problem Statement

Given two strings `ransomNote` and `magazine`, return `true` if `ransomNote` can be constructed by using the letters from `magazine` and `false` otherwise. Each letter in `magazine` can only be used once in `ransomNote`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the inputs case-sensitive?**
   - Yes, the inputs are case-sensitive. For example, 'a' and 'A' are considered different characters.

2. **Can the ransomNote and magazine be empty strings?**
   - Yes, both strings can be empty. If `ransomNote` is empty, return `true` because it trivially requires no letters.

3. **What is the maximum length of the ransomNote and magazine?**
   - In general practice problems, you can assume they won't exceed around \(10^5\) characters.

### Strategy

1. **Frequency Counting Method:**
   - Construct a frequency count of each character in `magazine`.
   - Traverse through `ransomNote` and check if each character is available in the frequency count constructed from `magazine`.
   - Decrease the frequency for each letter used. If a letter from `ransomNote` cannot be matched against the frequency count derived from `magazine`, return `false`.
   - If all characters in `ransomNote` can be matched while respecting their frequencies, return `true`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n + m), where `n` is the length of `ransomNote` and `m` is the length of `magazine`.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) since we only use a fixed-size frequency array of 26 letters (assuming only lowercase English letters).

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean canConstruct(String ransomNote, String magazine) {
        int[] charCount = new int[26]; // Frequency array for letters 'a' to 'z'
        
        // Populate the frequency array with counts from magazine
        for (char c : magazine.toCharArray()) {
            charCount[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        // Check each character in ransomNote
        for (char c : ransomNote.toCharArray()) {
            if (--charCount[c - 'a'] < 0) {
                return false; // If usage of any character exceeds its availability
            }
        }
        
        return true; // All characters are available with sufficient frequency
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Frequency Array Construction:**
   - `charCount` array is used to store the count of each character in the `magazine`. Since there are 26 lowercase English letters, the array size is 26.

2. **Character Check:**
   - For each character in `ransomNote`, we decrement the corresponding count in `charCount`. 
   - If at any point, the count becomes negative, it means the character is used more times than it appears in `magazine`, hence we return `false`.

3. **Return True:**
   - If we manage to process the entire `ransomNote` without finding any character overused, we return `true`.

This approach ensures an efficient determination of whether `ransomNote` can be constructed from `magazine`.
