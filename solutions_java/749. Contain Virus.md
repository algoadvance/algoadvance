[Leetcode 749. Contain Virus](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l749)
### Problem Statement
You are given a `m x n` 2D grid initialized with these three possible values:
1. `0` representing a cell with no virus.
2. `1` representing a cell infected by a virus.
3. `-1` representing a cell protected by a wall.

Initially, all the viruses are currently spreading every day to neighboring cells in the four binary directions (north, east, south, and west). However, it is possible to capture perhaps multiple regions simultaneously by installing walls around one or more contaminated regions (i.e., regions that are adjacent to each other).

You need to find the minimum number of walls required to contain the virus completely.

Return the number of walls used to contain the virus.

### Clarifying Questions:
Before we move to the strategy and implementation, here are some questions to clarify:

1. **Contiguous Infected Regions**: Can there be multiple disjoint regions of infection, and how do we handle them?
2. **Walls and Virus Spread**: When walls are placed, do they stop the virus completely from spreading to the neighboring cells?
3. **Daily Spread**: Is there a specific order in which the cells are considered for spreading the virus?

Assuming the cells spread one step uniformly at a time and a wall completely stops the spreading of the virus, letâ€™s move to the strategy.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we'll take the following steps:

1. **Identify Infected Regions**: Identify all the infected regions and the perimeter cells they would infect if not walled.
2. **Calculate Walls for Each Region**: For each region, calculate the number of walls needed to contain it and potential new infections.
3. **Select Optimal Region**: Select the region that, if contained, results in the maximum reduction of potential infection spread.
4. **Simulate Daily Spread**: After walls are placed, simulate the virus spread for the next day on the remaining unprotected cells.
5. **Repeat**: Repeat the above steps until all potential spreads are contained.

### Code
Here is a potential implementation in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class ContainVirus {
    
    private static final int[] DIRS = {-1, 0, 1, 0, -1};

    public int containVirus(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;
        int totalWalls = 0;
        while (true) {
            boolean[][] visited = new boolean[m][n];
            List<Set<int[]>> regions = new ArrayList<>();
            List<Set<int[]>> frontiers = new ArrayList<>();
            List<Integer> walls = new ArrayList<>();
            
            // Identify the regions
            for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                    if (grid[i][j] == 1 && !visited[i][j]) {
                        Set<int[]> region = new HashSet<>();
                        Set<int[]> frontier = new HashSet<>();
                        int[] wallCount = new int[]{0};
                        dfs(grid, i, j, visited, region, frontier, wallCount);
                        regions.add(region);
                        frontiers.add(frontier);
                        walls.add(wallCount[0]);
                    }
                }
            }

            // If no regions are found, we're done
            if (regions.isEmpty()) break;

            // Find the most dangerous region
            int idx = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i < frontiers.size(); i++) {
                if (frontiers.get(i).size() > frontiers.get(idx).size()) {
                    idx = i;
                }
            }

            // Use walls to contain the most dangerous region
            totalWalls += walls.get(idx);
            for (int[] cell : regions.get(idx)) {
                grid[cell[0]][cell[1]] = -1; // Wall off the region
            }

            // Spread the virus in all other regions
            for (int i = 0; i < regions.size(); i++) {
                if (i != idx) {
                    for (int[] cell : frontiers.get(i)) {
                        grid[cell[0]][cell[1]] = 1;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return totalWalls;
    }

    private void dfs(int[][] grid, int x, int y, boolean[][] visited, Set<int[]> region, Set<int[]> frontier, int[] walls) {
        int m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;
        if (x < 0 || x >= m || y < 0 || y >= n || visited[x][y] || grid[x][y] == -1) return;
        visited[x][y] = true;
        if (grid[x][y] == 1) {
            region.add(new int[]{x, y});
            for (int d = 0; d < 4; d++) {
                int newX = x + DIRS[d], newY = y + DIRS[d + 1];
                if (newX < 0 || newX >= m || newY < 0 || newY >= n || grid[newX][newY] == -1) continue;
                if (grid[newX][newY] == 0) {
                    frontier.add(new int[]{newX, newY});
                    walls[0]++;
                } else if (grid[newX][newY] == 1) {
                    dfs(grid, newX, newY, visited, region, frontier, walls);
                }
            }
        }
    }

}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is determined by the nested loops and the depth-first search (DFS) operations:
- **DFS per cell**: Each cell could be visited multiple times due to the DFS operation, leading to a time complexity of \(O(m \times n)\) per region identification.
- **Spread simulation**: Every spread operation would again be on the order of \(O(m \times n)\).

Hence, the overall time complexity is approximately \(O(m \times n \times (number\ of\ simulations))\), where the number of simulations is generally limited to the dimensional constraints and the initial spread configuration.

This solution aims to effectively minimize the potential spread by optimally placing walls and simulating the spread in a systematic manner.
