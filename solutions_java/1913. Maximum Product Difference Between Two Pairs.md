[Leetcode 1913. Maximum Product Difference Between Two Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1913)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`, where the length of `nums` is 4 or more. You need to find the maximum product difference between two pairs `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` where `a` and `b` are elements from the array `nums` as well as `c` and `d`, and their positions are distinct. The product difference is defined and computed as:
```
Product Difference = (a * b) - (c * d)
```
Return the maximum such product difference you can achieve.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the expected input size?**
   - The array `nums` will have a length of at least 4 and can be considerably large.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the values of the integers in `nums`?**
   - The problem does not specify this, but we can assume based on typical constraints that the integers can be both negative and positive.

3. **Can the pairs `(a, b)` and `(c, d)` include the same elements?**
   - No, the problem specifies that the elements have to be in distinct positions.

### Strategy

1. **Sorting Approach**:
   - Sort the array `nums` in ascending order.
   - The two largest elements (which will produce the maximum product) will be the last two elements of the sorted array.
   - The two smallest elements (which will produce the minimum product) will be the first two elements of the sorted array.
   - Calculate the product difference using these four elements.

### Code
The following Java code implements the sorting approach described:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MaxProductDifference {
    public int maxProductDifference(int[] nums) {
        // Step 1: Sort the array
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        
        // Step 2: Identify the two largest and two smallest elements
        int n = nums.length;
        int max1 = nums[n - 1];
        int max2 = nums[n - 2];
        int min1 = nums[0];
        int min2 = nums[1];
        
        // Step 3: Calculate the product differences
        int productDifference = (max1 * max2) - (min1 * min2);
        
        return productDifference;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaxProductDifference solution = new MaxProductDifference();
        int[] nums = {5, 6, 2, 7, 4};
        System.out.println(solution.maxProductDifference(nums));  // Output: 34
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting the array**: `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the length of the array.
- **Accessing the largest and smallest values**: `O(1)`.
  
The overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, so the time complexity is **O(n log n)**.

In this solution, we efficiently derive the maximum product difference by sorting the array and then using the appropriate elements from the sorted array to perform the calculation.
