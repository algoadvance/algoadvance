[Leetcode 1894. Find the Student that Will Replace the Chalk](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1894)
### Problem Statement
1894. Find the Student that Will Replace the Chalk

There are `n` students in a class numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. The teacher will give each student an unspecified amount of chalk one by one based on their positions. Once the chalk runs out, the student who is supposed to receive the next piece of chalk will replace it. Initially, the amount of chalk the teacher has is given by `k`.

You are given an integer array `chalk` where `chalk[i]` is the amount of chalk that the `i-th` student will consume. Return the index of the student that will replace the chalk.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are the values in the `chalk` array positive integers?
   **A:** Yes, each value in the `chalk` array is a positive integer.
   
2. **Q:** What range of values can `k` and the elements of `chalk` take?
   **A:** `k` and the elements of `chalk` are non-negative integers, where `k` can be large.
   
3. **Q:** Is there any situation where the chalk value in the array could be zero?
   **A:** No, the values in the `chalk` array are positive integers.

### Strategy
1. **Step 1:** Compute the total amount of chalk required for one complete round over all students.
2. **Step 2:** Determine the remaining amount of chalk after full rounds by using modulo operation `k = k % totalChalk`.
3. **Step 3:** Traverse the `chalk` array and subtract each studentâ€™s chalk requirement from `k`. The first student for whom `k` becomes less than 0 will be the one that needs to replace the chalk.

By using the modulo operation, we reduce the potentially large value of `k` to a smaller equivalent value, which reduces the number of iterations needed and optimizes the solution.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int chalkReplacer(int[] chalk, int k) {
        // Compute the total amount of chalk required for one round
        long totalChalk = 0;
        for (int c : chalk) {
            totalChalk += c;
        }
        
        // Reduce k mod totalChalk to get the remaining chalk
        k = (int)(k % totalChalk);

        // Find the student who will need to replace the chalk
        for (int i = 0; i < chalk.length; i++) {
            if (k < chalk[i]) {
                return i;
            }
            k -= chalk[i];
        }
        
        // Edge case: should never get here
        return -1;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization of `totalChalk`:** O(n) where `n` is the number of students, as we sum up all the chalk values.
- **Modulo Operation:** O(1) as it is a single arithmetic operation.
- **Finding the Student:** O(n) traversal through the array to find the student who will replace the chalk.

**Overall Time Complexity:** O(n)

This approach ensures that we handle even very large values of `k` efficiently and reduces unnecessary processing.
