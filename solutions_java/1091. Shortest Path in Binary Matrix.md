[Leetcode 1091. Shortest Path in Binary Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1091)
### Problem Statement

Given an `n x n` binary matrix `grid`, return the length of the shortest clear path in the matrix. If there is no clear path, return -1.

A clear path in a binary matrix is a path from the top-left cell (i.e., `grid[0][0]`) to the bottom-right cell (i.e., `grid[n-1][n-1]`) such that:

1. All the visited cells of the path are `0`.
2. All the adjacent cells of the path are 8-directionally connected (i.e., they are different and they share an edge or a corner).

The length of a clear path is the number of visited cells of this path.

**Example:**
```
Input: [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: 2
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Cell Content:**
   - Can the `grid[0][0]` or `grid[n-1][n-1]` be 1 (i.e., blocked)? 
     - Response: Yes, if either the start or end is `1`, then the path cannot be completed and should return -1.

2. **Path Movement:**
   - Can we move diagonally?
     - Response: Yes, you can move to eight possible directions (vertical, horizontal, and diagonal).

3. **Grid Size:**
   - What are the limits on `n` (the size of the grid)?
     - Response: `n` will be between 1 and 100.

### Strategy

We will use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm for this problem because BFS is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. 

**Steps:**

1. **Initial Checks:**
   - If the start (top-left) or end (bottom-right) is blocked (value `1`), return `-1`.

2. **Queue Initialization:**
   - Use a queue to perform BFS. Start by enqueuing the starting cell with the initial path length of `1`.

3. **Direction Array:**
   - Define an array to represent the 8 possible directions one can move.

4. **BFS Execution:**
   - Dequeue an element and explore all 8 possible directions.
   - For each valid direction, check if the cell is `0` and within boundaries. If so, mark it as visited and enqueue it with an incremented path length.

5. **End Condition:**
   - If we reach the bottom-right cell during BFS traversal, return the path length.
   - If the queue is exhausted and no path has been found, return `-1`.

### Code

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public class Solution {
    public int shortestPathBinaryMatrix(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;

        // Check if starting or ending cell is blocked
        if (grid[0][0] == 1 || grid[n-1][n-1] == 1) {
            return -1;
        }

        // Directions array for 8 possible movements (right, down-right, down, down-left, left, up-left, up, up-right)
        int[][] directions = {{1, 0}, {1, 1}, {0, 1}, {-1, 1}, {-1, 0}, {-1, -1}, {0, -1}, {1, -1}};
        
        // Queue for BFS
        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(new int[]{0, 0, 1});  // starting cell with initial path length of 1
        grid[0][0] = 1;  // mark as visited by setting it to 1
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] current = queue.poll();
            int x = current[0], y = current[1], dist = current[2];
            
            // If we have reached the bottom-right cell
            if (x == n-1 && y == n-1) {
                return dist;
            }
            
            // Explore all 8 directions
            for (int[] dir : directions) {
                int newX = x + dir[0], newY = y + dir[1];
                if (newX >= 0 && newX < n && newY >= 0 && newY < n && grid[newX][newY] == 0) {
                    queue.offer(new int[]{newX, newY, dist + 1});
                    grid[newX][newY] = 1;  // mark as visited
                }
            }
        }

        return -1;  // No path found
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is `O(n^2)` since each cell can be visited at most once.
- The space complexity is also `O(n^2)` for the BFS queue and auxiliary space for storing directions.

This algorithm ensures that we find the shortest path efficiently using BFS.
