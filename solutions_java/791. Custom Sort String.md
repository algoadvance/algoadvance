[Leetcode 791. Custom Sort String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l791)
## Problem Statement

You are given two strings, `order` and `s`. All the characters of `order` are unique, and `order` is a permutation of the characters in `s`. Reorder the characters of `s` so that they match the order that `order` was sorted. More specifically, if a character `x` appears before a character `y` in `order`, then `x` should appear before `y` in the reordered string.

Return any permutation of `s` that respects this ordering.

### Example 1:
```
Input: order = "cba", s = "abcd"
Output: "cbad"
```

### Constraints:
* 1 <= `order.length` <= 26
* 1 <= `s.length` <= 200
* `order` and `s` consist of lowercase English letters.
* All the characters of `order` are unique.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is it guaranteed that all characters in `s` will appear in `order`?**
   - Yes, since `order` is a permutation of the characters in `s`.
   
2. **Should we consider the frequency of characters in `s` while sorting?**
   - Yes, we need to maintain the frequency of characters.

3. **Can there be any additional characters in `s` which are not in `order`?**
   - No, as per the problem statement `order` is a permutation of the characters in `s`.

## Strategy

1. **Frequency Count:**
   - Count the frequency of each character in `s`.

2. **Sorting as per Order:**
   - Traverse through each character in `order` and append the characters from `s` to the result based on their count.

3. **Appending Remaining Characters:**
   - After sorting according to the `order`, append any remaining characters that are not included in the `order`. But as per problem statement, this step won't be necessary since `order` is a permutation of characters present in `s`.

## Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class CustomSortString {
    
    public String customSortString(String order, String s) {
        // Map to count frequency of characters in s
        HashMap<Character, Integer> countMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            countMap.put(ch, countMap.getOrDefault(ch, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        
        // Append characters as per the order
        for (char ch : order.toCharArray()) {
            if (countMap.containsKey(ch)) {
                int count = countMap.get(ch);
                for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
                    result.append(ch);
                }
                // Remove the character from the map once it is processed
                countMap.remove(ch);
            }
        }
        
        // Append remaining characters if any
        // which should not exist per problem statement
        for (char ch : countMap.keySet()) {
            int count = countMap.get(ch);
            for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
                result.append(ch);
            }
        }
        
        return result.toString();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CustomSortString sorter = new CustomSortString();
        String order = "cba";
        String s = "abcd";
        System.out.println(sorter.customSortString(order, s)); // Output: "cbad"
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Building Frequency Map:** O(n), where n is the length of string `s`.
- **Appending Characters According to Order:** O(m), where m is the length of string `order`.

The overall time complexity is O(n + m). Space complexity is O(n) for storing the frequency count.
