[Leetcode 1952. Three Divisors](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1952)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer `n`, return `true` if `n` has exactly three positive divisors. Otherwise, return `false`.

An integer `m` has exactly three positive divisors if and only if there exist two integers `a` and `b` such that:
1. `a` is a prime number.
2. `b = a^2` and `b` is exactly divisible by 1, `a`, and `a^2`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What are the constraints on the integer `n`?
   - `1 <= n <= 10^4`

2. What should be returned if `n` is less than 2 or is not a perfect square?
   - If `n` is less than 4 (since \(2^2=4\)), return `false`.
   - If `n` is not a perfect square, return `false`.

### Strategy
To solve the problem, we need to identify if `n` has exactly three divisors, which happens only when `n` is of the form \( p^2 \), where `p` is a prime. Here's our plan:

1. **Check if `n` is a perfect square:** Calculate the integer square root of `n`. If squaring it back doesn't give `n`, then `n` is not a perfect square.
2. **Check if the square root is prime:** If `n` is a perfect square, the next step is to check if the square root of `n` is a prime number.
3. **Return true if both conditions are met:** If both conditions are fulfilled, and the number has exactly three divisors (1, the square root, and the number itself).

### Code
```java
public class ThreeDivisors {
    public boolean isThree(int n) {
        // Check if n is a perfect square
        int sqrt = (int) Math.sqrt(n);
        if (sqrt * sqrt != n) {
            return false;
        }

        // Check if sqrt is a prime number
        return isPrime(sqrt);
    }

    // Helper method to check if a number is prime
    private boolean isPrime(int num) {
        if (num <= 1) return false;
        if (num == 2) return true; // 2 is the only even prime number
        if (num % 2 == 0) return false; // Other even numbers are not primes

        for (int i = 3; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i += 2) {
            if (num % i == 0) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    // Main method to test the function
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ThreeDivisors td = new ThreeDivisors();
        int test1 = 9;  // True, because 9 = 3^2 and 3 is prime
        int test2 = 12; // False, because 12 is not a square of a prime
        int test3 = 16; // False, because 16 = 4^2 and 4 is not prime
        
        System.out.println(td.isThree(test1)); // Expected: True
        System.out.println(td.isThree(test2)); // Expected: False
        System.out.println(td.isThree(test3)); // Expected: False
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Calculating sqrt:** \(O(1)\)
- **Prime check:** The prime check is \(O(\sqrt{m})\), where \(m\) is the value of the square root. In the worst case, this is \(O(\sqrt{\sqrt{n}})\) which simplifies to \(O(\sqrt{n})\) because the actual value checked is much smaller compared to \(n\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(sqrt(n))`. This is efficient given the constraints \(1 <= n <= 10^4\).
