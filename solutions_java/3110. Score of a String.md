[Leetcode 3110. Score of a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3110)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting only of characters `a`, `b`, and `c`. The function `scoreOfString(s: String) -> int` should return the score of the string, where the score is calculated as follows:

- Every character `a` has a score of 1.
- Every character `b` has a score of 2.
- Every character `c` has a score of 3.
- For every contiguous subsegment of identical characters, the score of the subsegment is multiplied by the length of the subsegment.

For example, the score of the string `"aaabbc"` is calculated as follows:
- `"aaa"` has a score of `1 * 3 = 3`
- `"bb"` has a score of `2 * 2 = 4`
- `"c"` has a score of `3 * 1 = 3`
So, the total score of `"aaabbc"` is `3 + 4 + 3 = 10`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: 
   - Minimum length of `s`? 
   - Maximum length of `s`? 
   - Any character other than `a`, `b`, and `c` that we might need to handle?
   
2. **Examples**: 
   - Should consider empty string as input as well? How to handle?
   - Any case sensitivity rules?

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int scoreOfString(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.length() == 0) return 0;

        int totalScore = 0;
        int currentScore = 0;
        int currentCount = 0;
        char prevChar = s.charAt(0);
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == prevChar) {
                currentCount++;
            } else {
                // Calculate the score of the previous contiguous segment
                totalScore += calculateSegmentScore(prevChar, currentCount);
                // Reset for the new character segment
                prevChar = c;
                currentCount = 1;
            }
        }
        
        // Handle the last segment
        totalScore += calculateSegmentScore(prevChar, currentCount);
        
        return totalScore;
    }

    private int calculateSegmentScore(char c, int count) {
        int baseScore = 0;
        switch (c) {
            case 'a':
                baseScore = 1;
                break;
            case 'b':
                baseScore = 2;
                break;
            case 'c':
                baseScore = 3;
                break;
        }
        return baseScore * count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.scoreOfString("aaabbc")); // Output: 10
        System.out.println(sol.scoreOfString("abcabc")); // Output: 9
        System.out.println(sol.scoreOfString(""));       // Output: 0
        System.out.println(sol.scoreOfString("aaa"));    // Output: 3
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with setting the `totalScore` to `0`.
   - Initialize `currentScore` and `currentCount` to `0`.
   - Track the `prevChar` as the first character of the string `s`.

2. **Traversing the String**:
   - Iterate through each character `c` in the string `s`.
   - If the character `c` is the same as `prevChar`, increment `currentCount`.
   - If the character `c` is different from `prevChar`:
     - Calculate the score of the segment ending with `prevChar` and add it to `totalScore`.
     - Update `prevChar` to the new character `c`.
     - Reset `currentCount` to `1`.

3. **Final Segment Calculation**:
   - After the loop, handle the last segment by adding its score to the `totalScore`.

4. **Helper Function**:
   - Implement `calculateSegmentScore` to calculate the score for a segment of identical characters based on the character's base score.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. We traverse the string once and perform constant-time operations.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we're using a fixed amount of extra space.
