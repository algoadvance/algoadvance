[Leetcode 467. Unique Substrings in Wraparound String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l467)
## Problem Statement

We are given a string `p` which is assumed to be a substring of an infinite wraparound string of alphabet "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz". We need to determine the number of unique non-empty substrings of `p` that are present in this wraparound string.

Wraparound string means a string where "z" is followed by "a", and it is infinite in both directions.

**Example:**  
`Input: p = "zab"`  
`Output: 6`  
**Explanation:**  
The substrings of `p` that are in the infinite wraparound string are: "z", "a", "b", "za", "ab", and "zab".

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the string `p` contain duplicate characters?
   **A:** Yes, the string `p` can contain duplicated characters.

2. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the length of `p`?
   **A:** The problem does not explicitly mention constraints, but typically constraints for string lengths in such problems are manageable within typical limits (usually up to 10^4 or 10^5).

3. **Q:** What should be returned if the string `p` is empty?
   **A:** The problem specifies non-empty substrings, so for an empty input string, the result should be 0.

## Strategy

1. **Break Down the Problem:**
   - Analyze how substrings in the wraparound string can be identified.
   - Each character in `p` can potentially start a valid series of substrings if it continues in the wraparound sequence.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Use an array `dp` of size 26 representing each character of the alphabet.
   - For each character `ch` in `p`, maintain the maximum length of contiguous substring ending with `ch` that is in wraparound order.
   - Update the count of unique substrings ending at each character as we iterate through `p`.

3. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Initialize the `dp` array with zeros.
   - Traverse the string `p` character by character:
     - Calculate if the current character continues the wraparound sequence from the previous character.
     - Update the `dp` array with the maximum length of valid substrings found so far ending at current character.
   - Sum all values in the `dp` array to get the number of unique substrings.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int findSubstringInWraproundString(String p) {
        int[] dp = new int[26];
        int maxLen = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < p.length(); i++) {
            if (i > 0 && (p.charAt(i) - p.charAt(i - 1) == 1 || p.charAt(i - 1) - p.charAt(i) == 25)) {
                maxLen++;
            } else {
                maxLen = 1;
            }
            int idx = p.charAt(i) - 'a';
            dp[idx] = Math.max(dp[idx], maxLen);
        }
        
        int result = 0;
        for (int count : dp) {
            result += count;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where `n` is the length of the string `p`. We make a single pass through the string `p`, and each character operation is O(1).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1). The space used is independent of the input size; the `dp` array has a fixed size of 26.

This strategy ensures that we efficiently count all unique substrings in the wraparound string specified.
