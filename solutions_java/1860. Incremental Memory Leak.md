[Leetcode 1860. Incremental Memory Leak full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1860)
### Problem Statement
You are given two integers `memory1` and `memory2` representing the initial amounts of memory in two memory banks. 

On the i-th second (starting from i = 1), the system will allocate i bytes of memory to the first bank if `memory1` is greater than or equal to `memory2`. Otherwise, it will allocate i bytes of memory to the second bank.

If there is enough memory in the corresponding memory bank, the system will continue the allocation; otherwise, it will stop.

Return an array containing:
1. The time (in seconds) at which the system stopped.
2. The remaining memory in the first bank.
3. The remaining memory in the second bank.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can `memory1` and `memory2` be equal?
   - Yes, the given amounts of memory can be equal.
2. If memory is not sufficient, should the system stop immediately?
   - Yes, the system should stop as soon as it cannot allocate the required amount of memory.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we will simulate the allocation process:

1. Initialize a variable `i` to represent the current second.
2. At each second, check which bank has more or equal memory.
3. Allocate `i` bytes to the appropriate bank.
4. If the chosen bank has enough memory, reduce its memory by `i` bytes and increment `i`.
5. If not, break the loop and return the current second, `memory1`, and `memory2`.
6. Continue this process until memory allocation is not possible for the current second `i`.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] memLeak(int memory1, int memory2) {
        int i = 1;
        
        while (true) {
            if (memory1 >= memory2) {
                if (memory1 >= i) {
                    memory1 -= i;
                } else {
                    break;
                }
            } else {
                if (memory2 >= i) {
                    memory2 -= i;
                } else {
                    break;
                }
            }
            i++;
        }
        
        return new int[] { i, memory1, memory2 };
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(\sqrt{\text{min}(memory1, memory2)})\), which comes from the fact that the sum of the first `n` natural numbers is \(\frac{n(n + 1)}{2}\). Therefore, the loop will run approximately \(\sqrt{\text{min}(memory1, memory2)}\) times before any memory runs out.
