### Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 837: New 21 Game

Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".

Alice starts with `0` points and draws numbers while she has less than `K` points. During each draw, she gains an integer number of points randomly from the range `[1, W]`, where each draw is independent and the probability of getting any integer within the range `[1, W]` is equal. Alice stops drawing numbers when she gets `K` or more points. Alice wins if her points are anywhere from `K` to `N` inclusive.

Given the integers `N`, `K`, and `W`, return the probability that Alice wins the game.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can points exceed N before reaching K?**
   - No, Alice stops drawing if the points reach or exceed `K`.

2. **What limits do the input values have?**
   - `0 ≤ K ≤ N ≤ 10^4` and `1 ≤ W ≤ 10^4`.

3. **Is there a minimum value for `K` where Alice starts drawing points?**
   - Yes, Alice starts drawing points while she has less than `K` points.

4. **Do points reset if Alice decides to stop drawing?**
   - No, Alice stops once she reaches or exceeds `K` points.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: 
   - We'll use a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the probability of having exactly `i` points.
   
2. **Initialization**:
   - `dp[0]` is 1 because Alice starts with 0 points.
   
3. **Filling DP Array**:
   - For each point value from 0 to `K-1`, calculate the probabilities for every future point Alice could get by drawing 1 to `W` points.

4. **Summation**:
   - For each point `i` from `K` to `N`, sum probabilities from `dp[i]` to get the final result.

5. **Sliding Window Optimization**:
   - Use a sliding window to maintain a running sum of probabilities to avoid recalculating sums repeatedly.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public double new21Game(int N, int K, int W) {
        if (K == 0 || N >= K + W) {
            return 1.0;
        }
        
        double[] dp = new double[N + 1];
        double sum = 1.0;  // This will store the sum of probabilities in the window
        dp[0] = 1.0;
        double result = 0.0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
            dp[i] = sum / W;
            if (i < K) {
                sum += dp[i];
            } else {
                result += dp[i];
            }
            if (i - W >= 0) {
                sum -= dp[i - W];
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N) 
  - This arises because we iterate over each `i` from 1 to `N` and maintain the sliding window sum which ensures each operation within the loop is O(1).

- **Space Complexity**: O(N) 
  - We use an array `dp` of size `N + 1` to store the probabilities.

This approach ensures we efficiently calculate the probability of Alice winning the game with the given constraints.
