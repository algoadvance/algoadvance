[Leetcode 1727. Largest Submatrix With Rearrangements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1727)
### Problem Statement

You are given a binary matrix `matrix` (a matrix consisting of only `0s` and `1s`). You can rearrange the columns of the given matrix in any order.

Return the area of the largest submatrix containing only `1s` after rearranging the columns optimally.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size of the matrix?**
   - The problem description does not specify limits, but as per LeetCode constraints, the size can be up to `200 x 200`.

2. **Can columns be swapped more than once?**
   - Yes, you can rearrange the columns in any order for optimal results.

3. **What is the expected type for the output?**
   - The expected output is a single integer representing the area of the largest submatrix.

4. **Are all elements in the matrix guaranteed to be either 0 or 1?**
   - Yes, the matrix is binary, containing only `0s` and `1s`.

### Strategy

1. **Column Rearrangement Insight**:
   - To maximize the area of submatrices composed of `1s`, the columns should be rearranged in descending order of the number of consecutive `1s` from top to bottom.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - For each row, calculate the number of consecutive `1s` ending at each column.
   - For each row, to maximize the submatrix area, sort the above-calculated columns in descending order and then compute the maximum rectangle area from that row.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - For each row, compute a histogram-like array that indicates the consecutive number of `1s`.
   - Use sorting to order these histograms in descending order to compute possible submatrix areas.
   - Track the maximum area found.

### Code

Here is a possible implementation in Java:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int largestSubmatrix(int[][] matrix) {
        if (matrix == null || matrix.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        int rows = matrix.length;
        int cols = matrix[0].length;
        int[][] height = new int[rows][cols];

        // Fill the height array
        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
                if (matrix[i][j] == 1) {
                    height[i][j] = i == 0 ? 1 : height[i - 1][j] + 1;
                }
            }
        }

        int maxArea = 0;

        // Calculate the maximum submatrix for each row
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            Arrays.sort(height[i]);
            for (int j = cols - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                int width = cols - j;
                int area = width * height[i][j];
                maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, area);
            }
        }

        return maxArea;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[][] matrix = {
            {0,0,1},
            {1,1,1},
            {1,0,1}
        };
        System.out.println(sol.largestSubmatrix(matrix));  // Output: 4
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The above solution runs in `O(n * m * log m)` time complexity, where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns:
1. **Histogram Calculation**: `O(n * m)`
2. **Sorting Histograms**: `O(n * m * log m)`
3. **Area Calculation**: `O(n * m)`

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n * m * log m)`. This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the largest submatrix area possible after optimal rearrangement of columns.
