[Leetcode 903. Valid Permutations for DI Sequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l903)
### Problem Statement

A permutation of an array of integers is **valid** if for a given sequence of `'D'` and `'I'` characters, where `'D'` means the next number has to be smaller, and `'I'` means the next number has to be larger, the permutation follows these rules.

You are given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters `'D'` and `'I'`. Find the number of valid permutations of an array of the first `n+1` positive integers that satisfy the given `'D'` and `'I'` sequence. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Length Constraints**: What is the maximum length for the input string `s`?
   - The length of `s` (n) can be up to `200`.

2. **Output Constraints**: Should the result always be returned modulo `10^9 + 7`?
   - Yes, the result should always be returned modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach**:
    - Use a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of valid permutations using the first `i+1` numbers and ending with number `j` at index `i`.
    - Initialize the DP table for base cases. For the first position, each single number forms a trivial valid sequence.
    - Iterate through the sequence `s` and update the DP table based on whether the current character is `'D'` or `'I'`.
    - Sum up the appropriate values from the previous row based on whether it is an increasing or decreasing condition.

2. **Modulo Operation**:
    - Since the numbers can get very large, we need to use modulo `10^9 + 7` to handle overflow and match the specified constraints.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is `O(n^3)` due to the nested loops iterating over `n` and potential summations over ranges up to `n`.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    private static final int MOD = 1000000007;

    public int numPermsDISequence(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][n + 1];

        // Base case: single number permutations
        for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = 1;
        }

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i - 1) == 'I') {
                for (int j = 0; j <= n - i; j++) {
                    dp[i][j] = 0;
                    for (int k = 0; k < j; k++) {
                        dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - 1][k]) % MOD;
                    }
                }
            } else {
                for (int j = 0; j <= n - i; j++) {
                    dp[i][j] = 0;
                    for (int k = j + 1; k <= n - i + 1; k++) {
                        dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - 1][k]) % MOD;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        int result = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
            result = (result + dp[n][j]) % MOD;
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        String s = "DID";
        int result = solution.numPermsDISequence(s);
        System.out.println("Result: " + result);  // Example output test
    }
}
```

This code appropriately initializes the DP table, iterates through cases for 'I' and 'D', and calculates permutations while managing large numbers with modulo operations. The main function shows an example test, ensuring the solution works correctly.
