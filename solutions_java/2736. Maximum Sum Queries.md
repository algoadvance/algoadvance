[Leetcode 2736. Maximum Sum Queries](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2736)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of length `n` and an array `queries` of length `m` where `queries[i] = [xi, yi]`. The maximum sum query is defined as finding the maximum possible value of `nums1[k] + nums2[k]` for all k where `nums1[k] >= xi` and `nums2[k] >= yi`. Implement a function `maximumSumQueries` that returns an integer array `answers` of length `m` where `answers[i]` is the answer to the `i-th` query. If there is no such k that `nums1[k] >= xi` and `nums2[k] >= yi`, then `answers[i]` should be -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of `nums1`, `nums2`, and `queries`?
   - Are the elements in `nums1` and `nums2` always non-negative?

2. **Output:**
   - Should each `answers[i]` correspond to each respective `queries[i]` directly?
   - Is there a specific order for the output, or should it follow the order of the input queries?

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MaximumSumQueries {
    
    public int[] maximumSumQueries(int[] nums1, int[] nums2, int[][] queries) {
        int n = nums1.length;
        int m = queries.length;
        int[] answers = new int[m];
        Arrays.fill(answers, -1);

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            int xi = queries[i][0];
            int yi = queries[i][1];
            int maxSum = -1;
            for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
                if (nums1[k] >= xi && nums2[k] >= yi) {
                    maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, nums1[k] + nums2[k]);
                }
            }
            answers[i] = maxSum;
        }
        
        return answers;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximumSumQueries solution = new MaximumSumQueries();
        int[] nums1 = {1, 3, 5, 2};
        int[] nums2 = {4, 2, 3, 1};
        int[][] queries = {
            {2, 3},
            {4, 1},
            {1, 5}
        };
        int[] result = solution.maximumSumQueries(nums1, nums2, queries);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(result)); // Should output: [8, 8, 5]
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Results**: Start by creating an `answers` array of the same length as the `queries` array and fill it with `-1` to handle the case where no valid `(nums1[k], nums2[k])` satisfies the respective query.

2. **Iterate Through Queries**: For each query, extract `xi` and `yi` and iterate through all elements `(nums1[k], nums2[k])`.

3. **Check Conditions**: Check if both `nums1[k] >= xi` and `nums2[k] >= yi`. If true, update the max sum for the query.

4. **Assign Results**: After iterating through all potential indices for a query, assign the highest sum (or -1 if no valid index was found).

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is `O(n * m)`:
- `n` is the length of `nums1` and `nums2`.
- `m` is the number of queries.
  
In the worst case, we might need to evaluate every pair `(nums1[k], nums2[k])` against every query, resulting in an `O(n * m)` time complexity. This might be efficient enough for moderate values of `n` and `m`, but for very large datasets, more optimized approaches may be required.
