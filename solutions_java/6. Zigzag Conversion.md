[Leetcode 6. Zigzag Conversion](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l6)
### Problem Statement
The **Zigzag Conversion** problem can be described as follows:

Given a string `s` and a number of rows `numRows`, arrange the characters of the string in a zigzag pattern on the given number of rows, and then read the characters row by row.

For example, the string "PAYPALISHIRING" with `numRows = 3` is arranged in a zigzag pattern as follows:
```
P   A   H   N
A P L S I I G
Y   I   R
```
And the output string (reading it row by row) would be: `"PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the length range of the input string?
   - What is the range of `numRows`?

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - What should be the output if `numRows` is 1?
   - How should we handle an empty input string?

### Code
Let's implement this in Java:

```java
public class ZigzagConversion {
    public String convert(String s, int numRows) {
        if (numRows == 1 || s.length() <= numRows) {
            return s;
        }
        
        StringBuilder[] rows = new StringBuilder[numRows];
        for (int i = 0; i < numRows; i++) {
            rows[i] = new StringBuilder();
        }
        
        int currentRow = 0;
        boolean goingDown = false;
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            rows[currentRow].append(c);
            if (currentRow == 0 || currentRow == numRows - 1) {
                goingDown = !goingDown;
            }
            currentRow += goingDown ? 1 : -1;
        }
        
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        for (StringBuilder row : rows) {
            result.append(row);
        }
        
        return result.toString();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ZigzagConversion converter = new ZigzagConversion();
        System.out.println(converter.convert("PAYPALISHIRING", 3));  // Output: "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
        System.out.println(converter.convert("PAYPALISHIRING", 4));  // Output: "PINALSIGYAHRPI"
    }
}
```

### Strategy
1. **Edge Cases Handling**:
   - If `numRows` is 1 or if the length of the string `s` is less than or equal to `numRows`, return the string `s` as it is. This is because no zigzag pattern would need to be applied.
  
2. **Allocate Rows**:
   - Use an array of `StringBuilder` to hold the characters for each row. Initialize each `StringBuilder`.
  
3. **Traverse the String**:
   - Use a loop to traverse through each character of the string.
   - Determine the current row and the direction (either up or down) for placing characters.
   - Place characters accordingly in the respective `StringBuilder` objects.

4. **Combine Rows**:
   - After populating characters in their respective rows, concatenate all rows and return the final result.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we are processing each character of the string exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string `s`, due to the storage required for the `rows` array of `StringBuilder` objects.

This solution ensures that the characters are arranged and read in a zigzag pattern efficiently.
