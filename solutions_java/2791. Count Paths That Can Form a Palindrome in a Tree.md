[Leetcode 2791. Count Paths That Can Form a Palindrome in a Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2791)
## Problem Statement

The problem requires counting the number of paths in a tree such that the concatenation of characters (associated with nodes) along the path forms a palindrome. Given the tree with `n` nodes, you need to determine how many such paths exist.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Description**:
   - How are the tree nodes and their connections provided?
   - Where are the characters associated with each node provided?

2. **Output Description**:
   - What should be the format of the output?
   
3. **Constraints**:
   - What are the constraints on `n` (number of nodes)?
   - Are there any constraints on the characters (e.g., only lowercase English letters)?

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - What should be considered for paths of length 1 (only one node)?
   - Should all nodes be treated distinctively even if they have the same character?

## Strategy

### Approach

1. **Tree Representation**:
   - Represent the tree using an adjacency list.
   - Store character associations in an array/list.

2. **Counting Palindromic Paths**:
   - Use Depth First Search (DFS) to explore paths from any starting node.
   - Use bit manipulation to keep track of the character counts along the path dynamically.
   - A palindromic path means each character count should be even, or at most one character count can be odd.
   
3. **Bitmasking Techniques**:
   - Use a 26-bit integer as the bitmask (since there are 26 lowercase English letters).
   - Flip the bit corresponding to a character when traversing a node.
   - Check if the current bitmask, or any bitmask differing by exactly one bit, has been seen before.

### Detailed Steps

1. Initialize an array to keep track of frequencies of character bitmasks seen.
2. Perform DFS from the root.
3. During DFS, for each node:
   - Update the current path bitmask.
   - Check if the current bitmask or any similar bitmask (differing by one bit) is in the frequency array.
   - Increment the result counter if a valid palindromic path is identified.
   - Recur for child nodes.
   - Backtrack (unvisit) the node to ensure we only count unique paths.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    private int result = 0;
    private Map<Integer, Integer> freqMap = new HashMap<>();
    
    public int countPalindromicPaths(int n, int[][] edges, String s) {
        List<List<Integer>> tree = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            tree.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            tree.get(edge[0]).add(edge[1]);
            tree.get(edge[1]).add(edge[0]);
        }
        
        freqMap.put(0, 1);
        dfs(0, -1, 0, tree, s);
        
        return result;
    }
    
    private void dfs(int node, int parent, int pathMask, List<List<Integer>> tree, String s) {
        pathMask ^= 1 << (s.charAt(node) - 'a');
        
        result += freqMap.getOrDefault(pathMask, 0);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            int mask = pathMask ^ (1 << i);
            result += freqMap.getOrDefault(mask, 0);
        }
        
        freqMap.put(pathMask, freqMap.getOrDefault(pathMask, 0) + 1);
        
        for (int neighbor : tree.get(node)) {
            if (neighbor == parent) continue;
            dfs(neighbor, node, pathMask, tree, s);
        }
        
        freqMap.put(pathMask, freqMap.get(pathMask) - 1);
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \times 26)\): Traversal of `n` nodes, and bit manipulation operations are constant, hence simplified to O(n).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n + 2^26)\): For storing the tree and the frequency map. The map can have at most \(2^{26}\) entries, but realistically itâ€™s considerably less as paths will not cover all combinations.

This ensures our approach is efficient for medium-sized tree graphs.
