[Leetcode 1531. String Compression II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1531)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, the string `s` can be compressed using the following algorithm:

1. Begin with an empty compressed string `str`.
2. For each group of consecutive repeating characters, append either the character followed by the count if the count is more than 1, or the character alone if the count is 1.

You can also delete at most `k` characters from `s` in order to achieve the minimum possible length of the compressed string.

Return the length of the shortest compressed string that can be obtained using these operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - The length of the string `s` ranges from 1 to 100.
   - The integer `k` is between 0 and `s.length`.
   
2. **Output:**
   - Return an integer value indicating the minimum length of the compressed string.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - How should we handle edge cases where deleting characters doesn’t change the compression length? 
   - How should we handle uniformly repeating or unique characters case?
  
Let’s proceed to the solution.

### Strategy

We can solve this problem using Dynamic Programming (DP) with memoization. The key idea is to evaluate all possible states of the string after making up to `k` deletions, and compute the minimum compressed length for those states.

1. **Define State:**
   - `dp[i][k]` will represent the minimum length of the compressed string for the substring starting at index `i` with `k` deletions allowed.

2. **Transition between States:**
   - The DP table will be filled by considering whether to delete a character or not, and keeping track of the number of repetitions of each character.

3. **Base Case:**
   - If there are no more characters left to process and deletions left, the compressed length is 0.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int getLengthOfOptimalCompression(String s, int k) {
        int n = s.length();
        Integer[][] dp = new Integer[n + 1][k + 1];
        return helper(s, 0, k, dp);
    }
    
    private int helper(String s, int i, int k, Integer[][] dp) {
        if (k < 0) return Integer.MAX_VALUE; // If deletions exceeded
        if (i >= s.length() || s.length() - i <= k) return 0; // All remaining can be deleted
        
        if (dp[i][k] != null) return dp[i][k];
        
        int res = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int[] count = new int[26];
        int maxFreq = 0;
        for (int j = i; j < s.length(); j++) {
            count[s.charAt(j) - 'a']++;
            maxFreq = Math.max(maxFreq, count[s.charAt(j) - 'a']);
            int cost = 1 + (maxFreq > 1 ? 1 + ("" + maxFreq).length() - 1 : 0);
            res = Math.min(res, cost + helper(s, j + 1, k - (j - i + 1 - maxFreq), dp));
        }
        
        dp[i][k] = res;
        return dp[i][k];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this DP approach is `O(n^2 * k)` where `n` is the length of the string `s` and `k` is the number of deletions. This is because for each position `i`, we explore up to `n` positions and make recursive calls considering up to `k` deletions.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is `O(n * k)` to store the memoization table `dp`, plus the recursive stack space which is `O(n)` in the worst case.

By leveraging this dynamic programming strategy, we efficiently compute the minimum compressed length possible after at most `k` deletions.
