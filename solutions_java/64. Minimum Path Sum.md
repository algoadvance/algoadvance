[Leetcode 64. Minimum Path Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l64)
### Problem Statement

Given a `m x n` grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path. You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What should I return if the input grid is empty?
   **A:** You can assume the grid will always have at least one cell.

2. **Q:** Is there any constraint on the values inside the grid?
   **A:** The grid will always contain non-negative integers only.

3. **Q:** Can you move diagonally?
   **A:** No, you can only move either down or right.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use Dynamic Programming (DP). The idea is to construct a `dp` table where `dp[i][j]` contains the minimum path sum to reach cell `(i, j)`.

Here's the strategy:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The top-left cell `dp[0][0]` is simply the grid's top-left cell value.
   - Fill in the first row where `dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + grid[0][j]` since you can only move right.
   - Fill in the first column where `dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][0]` since you can only move down.
   
2. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - For other cells, `dp[i][j]` is the minimum of the value coming from the top or the left, plus the current cellâ€™s value:
     `dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.

3. **Result**:
   - The value at the bottom-right cell `dp[m-1][n-1]` will be the minimum path sum.

### Code

Here is the implementation in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minPathSum(int[][] grid) {
        if (grid == null || grid.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        int[][] dp = new int[m][n];
        
        // Initialize the DP table with the grid's array values.
        dp[0][0] = grid[0][0];
        
        // Fill in the first row.
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + grid[0][j];
        }
        
        // Fill in the first column.
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][0];
        }
        
        // Fill in the rest of the DP table.
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + Math.min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
            }
        }
        
        // The answer is in the bottom-right cell.
        return dp[m-1][n-1];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

* **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is \(O(m \times n)\), where \(m\) is the number of rows and \(n\) is the number of columns. This is because we fill each cell of the `dp` table exactly once.

* **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(m \times n)\) due to the additional `dp` array of the same size as the grid. However, it can be optimized to \(O(n)\) by using a single-dimensional array if needed.
