[Leetcode 2271. Maximum White Tiles Covered by a Carpet](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2271)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer array `tiles` where `tiles[i] = [li, ri]` represents that every tile from position `li` to position `ri` (inclusive) is colored white. You are also given an integer `carpetLen`, which represents the length of a carpet that can be placed over any range of tiles. You need to return the maximum number of white tiles that can be covered by the carpet.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume that the input array `tiles` is sorted based on the starting positions `li`?
   - If not, should I sort it first?
   
2. Are there any constraints on the size of the array `tiles` or the values of `li` and `ri`?
   
3. Can tiles overlap, and how should this be handled?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can utilize a "sliding window" approach along with sorting:

1. **Sort the Tiles**: Start by sorting the `tiles` array based on the starting positions `li`. This will allow us to easily slide a window over the possible positions for the carpet.
2. **Sliding Window**: We maintain two pointers (let's name them `start` and `end`) to represent the current range covered by the carpet.
3. **Track Maximum Coverage**: As we slide the window, we keep track of the current number of white tiles covered by the carpet. If moving the `end` pointer exceeds the carpet length, adjust the `start` pointer accordingly.
4. **Update Covered Tiles Count**: While sliding the window, continuously update the maximum number of white tiles that we can cover.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MaximumWhiteTiles {
    public int maximumWhiteTiles(int[][] tiles, int carpetLen) {
        // Step 1: Sort the tiles array based on the starting positions
        Arrays.sort(tiles, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);

        int maxCovered = 0;
        int currentCovered = 0;
        int start = 0;

        for (int end = 0; end < tiles.length; end++) {
            // Add the white tiles covered by the current tile range to currentCovered
            currentCovered += tiles[end][1] - tiles[end][0] + 1;

            // While the carpet's right end is beyond the current tile's left end
            while (tiles[start][0] + carpetLen - 1 < tiles[end][1]) {
                // Reduce the currentCovered by the number of tiles that the carpet cannot cover
                int overCovered = Math.max(0, tiles[start][0] + carpetLen - tiles[end][0]);
                maxCovered = Math.max(maxCovered, currentCovered - overCovered);
                currentCovered -= tiles[start][1] - tiles[start][0] + 1;
                start++;
            }

            maxCovered = Math.max(maxCovered, currentCovered);
        }

        return maxCovered;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximumWhiteTiles solver = new MaximumWhiteTiles();

        int[][] tiles = {
            {1, 5},
            {10, 11},
            {12, 18},
            {20, 25},
            {30, 32}
        };
        int carpetLen = 10;
        int result = solver.maximumWhiteTiles(tiles, carpetLen);
        System.out.println("Maximum White Tiles Covered: " + result);  // Output should be 9
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: Sorting the `tiles` array takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of tiles.
- **Sliding Window**: Traversing the `tiles` array with two pointers results in \(O(n)\) operations.

Overall, the time complexity of this approach is \(O(n \log n)\), primarily dominated by the sorting step.
