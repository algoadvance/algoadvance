[Leetcode 3154. Find Number of Ways to Reach the K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3154)
### Problem Statement
You are given a staircase with `n` stairs, and you are standing at the bottom of the stairs. Each time you can either climb 1 stair or 2 stairs. In how many distinct ways can you reach the top of the staircase (that is, the `n`-th stair)?

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Edge Cases**:
   - What if `n` is 0? (There's only one way to be at the ground without moving).
   - What if `n` is 1? (There's only one way to reach the first stair).
   - What if `n` is a negative number? (Not applicable as stairs count can't be negative).

2. **Input/Output**:
   - **Input**: The number `n`, an integer representing the number of stairs.
   - **Output**: The count of distinct ways to reach the `n`-th stair.

3. **Constraints**:
   - The input number `n` will be a non-negative integer.
   - What is the maximum value of `n`? (This will help determine whether we need an optimized solution for larger values).

### Strategy
This problem is a classic dynamic programming problem related to the Fibonacci sequence. Each step can be reached either from the previous step (one step) or two steps back. Therefore, the number of ways to reach the `n`-th step (`ways(n)`) is:
- ways(n) = ways(n-1) + ways(n-2)

We'll use dynamic programming to store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

### Steps
1. Handle edge cases where `n` is 0 or 1 directly.
2. Use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach the `i`-th step.
3. Initialize `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` appropriately.
4. Iterate from 2 to `n` to fill the `dp` array using the relation `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]`.
5. Return `dp[n]` as the result.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) because we fill the `dp` array once with `n` elements.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for storing the `dp` array. However, we can optimize this to O(1) by using only two variables to keep track of the last two results if needed.

### Code

Here's the Java code:

```java
public class Staircase {

    public static int numberOfWays(int n) {
        // Base cases
        if (n == 0) return 1;
        if (n == 1) return 1;

        // Initialize dp array
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 1; // One way to stay at the ground
        dp[1] = 1; // One way to reach the first stair

        // Fill the dp array
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2];
        }

        // The number of ways to reach the n-th stair
        return dp[n];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 5; // Example input
        System.out.println("Number of ways to reach the " + n + "-th stair: " + numberOfWays(n)); // Output should be 8
    }
}
```

### Optimized Space Complexity

If needed we can reduce the space complexity to O(1):

```java
public class Staircase {

    public static int numberOfWays(int n) {
        // Base cases
        if (n == 0) return 1;
        if (n == 1) return 1;

        // Variables to store results for the last two steps
        int prev1 = 1; // Ways to reach (n-1)th stair
        int prev2 = 1; // Ways to reach (n-2)th stair

        // Calculate ways to reach each stair from 2 to n
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            int current = prev1 + prev2;
            prev2 = prev1;
            prev1 = current;
        }

        // The number of ways to reach the n-th stair
        return prev1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 5; // Example input
        System.out.println("Number of ways to reach the " + n + "-th stair: " + numberOfWays(n)); // Output should be 8
    }
}
```

This solution uses only two variables to keep track of the states, thereby reducing the space complexity to O(1).
