[Leetcode 2317. Maximum XOR After Operations  full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2317)
### Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. In one operation, you can select any non-negative integer `x` and update any element of `nums` to be `nums[i] AND (nums[i] XOR x)`.

Return *the maximum possible bitwise XOR of all elements of `nums` after applying the operation any number of times.*

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `nums` contain negative numbers?**
   - No, `nums` contains only non-negative integers.
   
2. **What should be the return type of the function?**
   - The function should return an integer which is the maximum XOR of all elements.

---

### Strategy
1. **Observation:**
   - The operation allows us to change `nums[i]` to any number less than or equal to `nums[i]`.
   - The XOR operation of all the elements in the array will only be maximized if each bit in the resultant number has a chance to be `1`.

2. **Optimal Operation:**
   - Given the constraints where the number can only decrease or stay the same, we should aim to set as many bits in the result to `1` as possible.
   - Thus, the result of maximum XOR likely involves each element `nums[i]` contributing to the maximum possible value it holds (i.e., performing operations on `nums` such that we get the maximum XOR).

3. **Approach:**
    - Iterate through the list and take the bitwise OR of all elements. This is because taking the OR will ensure every bit that can possibly be `1` is set to `1` in the result.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int maximumXOR(int[] nums) {
        int result = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            result |= num;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array. We are iterating through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we use only a fixed amount of additional space regardless of the input size.
