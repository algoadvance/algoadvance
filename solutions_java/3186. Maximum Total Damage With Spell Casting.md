## Problem Statement

**3186. Maximum Total Damage With Spell Casting-out**

You are given an array spells of length n, where spells[i] is the damage you can deal by casting the i-th spell. You have a total of k spell casts. You want to maximize the total damage you deal by selecting spells to cast.

Given the array spells and the integer k, return the maximum total damage you can deal with k spell casts.

**Example:**
```
Input: spells = [3, 1, 5, 7, 9], k = 3
Output: 21
```

In this example, you can select the spells with damage values `5`, `7`, and `9` since they have the highest possible damage values.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the array always non-empty?**
   - Yes, the array spells will have at least one element.
   
2. **Can the value of k be larger than the length of the array spells?**
   - No, k will always be less than or equal to the length of the array.

3. **Are there any negative values in the spells array?**
   - No, all values in the spells array are non-negative integers.
   
4. **Will the spells array contain distinct values?**
   - No guarantee, spells can have duplicate values.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, our strategy will be:

1. **Sort the Array:** First, we sort the `spells` array in descending order to easily access the `k` highest damage spells.
2. **Sum the k Largest Values:** Once sorted, take the first `k` elements from the sorted array and return their sum.

This approach ensures that we are maximizing the total damage by always selecting the highest possible damage spells up to `k` casts.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is primarily determined by the sorting step:

- Sorting the array takes `O(n log n)` time.
- Summing the top `k` elements takes `O(k)` time.

Since `k <= n`, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it `O(n log n)`.

## Code

Here is the Java implementation for the above strategy:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MaximumTotalDamage {
    public int maxTotalDamage(int[] spells, int k) {
        // Sort spells in descending order
        Arrays.sort(spells);
        int n = spells.length;
        int sum = 0;
        // Sum the top k elements
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= n - k; i--) {
            sum += spells[i];
        }
        return sum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximumTotalDamage solution = new MaximumTotalDamage();
        int[] spells = {3, 1, 5, 7, 9};
        int k = 3;
        System.out.println(solution.maxTotalDamage(spells, k)); // Output: 21
    }
}
```

This code first sorts the array in ascending order (using the default `Arrays.sort` method), then iterates from the end of the sorted array to sum the highest `k` spells, providing the maximum total damage.
