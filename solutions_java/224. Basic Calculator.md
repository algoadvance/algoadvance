[Leetcode 224. Basic Calculator](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l224)
### Problem Statement
Implement a basic calculator to evaluate a simple expression string.

The expression string may contain open `(` and closing parentheses `)`, the plus `+` or minus sign `-`, non-negative integers, and empty spaces.

You may assume that the given expression is always valid.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: "1 + 1"
Output: 2

Input: " 2-1 + 2 "
Output: 3

Input: "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
Output: 23
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the expression contain other operators like `*` or `/`?
   - No, the expression only contains `+`, `-`, `(`, and `)`.
   
2. Will there always be a valid expression given as input?
   - Yes, the input expression is always valid.

3. How large could the input string be?
   - Assume reasonable bounds according to typical competitive programming constraints, e.g., the string length will not exceed \(10^4\).

4. Should we consider any precedence other than the usual `()` handling?
   - No, only the `+` and `-` operators need to be handled along with parentheses precedence.

### Strategy
The idea is to use a stack to handle parenthesis and maintain the current result and sign:
1. Iterate through the string character by character.
2. Use a stack to store the result and sign before encountering a parenthesis.
3. Track the current number and current sign.
4. When encountering a digit, we construct the number to handle multi-digit numbers.
5. When encountering `+`, add the current number to the result and update the sign.
6. When encountering `-`, subtract the current number from the result and update the sign.
7. When encountering `(`, push the current result and sign onto the stack and reset them.
8. When encountering `)`, pop the result and sign from the stack and add the current result to the result on the stack.

### Code
```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class BasicCalculator {
    public int calculate(String s) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        int result = 0;
        int number = 0;
        int sign = 1; // 1 means positive, -1 means negative

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            
            if (Character.isDigit(c)) {
                number = number * 10 + (c - '0');
            } else if (c == '+') {
                result += sign * number;
                number = 0;
                sign = 1;
            } else if (c == '-') {
                result += sign * number;
                number = 0;
                sign = -1;
            } else if (c == '(') {
                stack.push(result);
                stack.push(sign);
                result = 0;
                sign = 1;
            } else if (c == ')') {
                result += sign * number;
                number = 0;
                result *= stack.pop();    // this is the sign
                result += stack.pop();    // this is the result before parenthesis
            }
        }
        
        if (number != 0) {
            result += sign * number;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BasicCalculator calculator = new BasicCalculator();
        System.out.println(calculator.calculate("1 + 1")); // Output: 2
        System.out.println(calculator.calculate(" 2-1 + 2 ")); // Output: 3
        System.out.println(calculator.calculate("(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)")); // Output: 23
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the expression string. Each character in the string is processed exactly once.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is \(O(n)\) in the worst case due to the stack usage, especially if the input has multiple nested parenthesis.
