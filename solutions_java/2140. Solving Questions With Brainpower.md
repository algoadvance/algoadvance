[Leetcode 2140. Solving Questions With Brainpower](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2140)
## Problem Statement:
You are given a 2D integer array `questions` where `questions[i] = [points_i, brainpower_i]`.

The array describes the questions of an exam, where you have to solve the questions in order (i.e., you can only solve question i if you have already solved all the previous questions) or skip the question without solving it.

- `points_i` is the points you get for solving the `i-th` question.
- `brainpower_i` is the number of subsequent questions after the `i-th` question that you need to skip when solving the `i-th` question.

- The goal is to maximize the total points you can get.

Return the maximum points you can achieve.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: questions = [[3,2],[4,3],[4,4],[2,5]]
Output: 5
Explanation: Solve question 0: get 3 points, skip the next 2 questions, so skip question 1 and 2.
             Then solve question 3: get 2 points.
             Total points = 3 + 2 = 5.
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= questions.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= points_i, brainpower_i <= 10^5`

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Can I solve questions in any order?
   - No, questions should be considered in the given order.
2. Can the brainpower exceed the number of remaining questions when taken into account?
   - Yes, which means you would skip over all remaining questions.
3. Should I consider edge cases such as single-element arrays?
   - Yes, consider the simplest cases as well.

## Strategy:
- This problem is a variation of the dynamic programming "knapsack" problem.
- We need to decide for each question whether to solve it or skip it.
- Use dynamic programming to store the maximum points up to each question.
- Define an array `dp` where `dp[i]` will store the maximum points we can collect from question `i` to the end.
- Use a bottom-up approach, filling `dp` from the end of the list to the start.

## Code:
```java
class Solution {
    public long mostPoints(int[][] questions) {
        int n = questions.length;
        long[] dp = new long[n + 1]; // Add one to handle base case easily.
        
        // Traverse the array from right to left
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int points = questions[i][0];
            int brainpower = questions[i][1];
            
            // Calculate the next index to solve after brainpower
            int nextIdx = i + 1 + brainpower;
            
            // If nextIdx is within bounds, add its corresponding dp value, else only consider points
            if (nextIdx < n) {
                dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i + 1], points + dp[nextIdx]); // Solve or skip
            } else {
                dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i + 1], points); // Solve or skip
            }
        }
        
        return dp[0]; // Maximum points achievable starting from question 0
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where `n` is the number of questions. We process each question once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for storing the dp array which tracks maximum points from each starting index.

With this solution, we ensure that we maximize the total points while accounting for the constraints provided by each question's brainpower requirements.
