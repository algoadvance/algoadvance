[Leetcode 1798. Maximum Number of Consecutive Values You Can Make](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1798)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `coins` of length `n` which represents the `n` coins the player has. The value of the i-th coin is `coins[i]`. The player can make different sums by choosing some of these coins. However, when picking the coins, they can only make values of a sum of consecutive values starting from 1.

Given this, you need to find out the maximum number of consecutive integer values that can be made starting from 1.

**Example:**

- Input: `coins = [1,3]`
- Output: `2`

**Explanation:**
With `coins = [1, 3]`, you can create the sum 1, but you can't create the sum 2. Hence, the maximum number of consecutive integer values you can create is 2 (`1` and `2`).

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the values in the `coins` array guaranteed to be positive integers?
   - Yes, we assume all coin values are positive integers.
2. Can the `coins` array be empty?
   - No, by problem statement assumption, the `coins` array contains at least one coin.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can follow a greedy approach:

1. **Sort the Array**: Start by sorting the `coins` array. This allows us to tackle the smallest values first.
2. **Iterate and determine the range of sums**: Initialize a variable `maxConsecutive` to 0 that keeps track of the maximum consecutive sum we can form up to now.
3. **Incremental Construction**:
    - Iterate through the sorted `coins` array:
        - For each coin `c`, check if it can extend the current consecutive sum range. The criterion is if the coin's value `c` is less than or equal to `maxConsecutive + 1`.
        - If yes, add `c` to `maxConsecutive`.
        - Otherwise, break the loop because the next coins are too large to fill the gap.
4. **Final Value**: The variable `maxConsecutive` after the loop indicates the maximum sum of consecutive integers that can be formed starting from 1.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class ConsecutiveValuesMaker {

    public int getMaximumConsecutive(int[] coins) {
        Arrays.sort(coins);
        int maxConsecutive = 0;
        for (int coin : coins) {
            if (coin > maxConsecutive + 1) {
                break; // Cannot use this coin to create more consecutive values
            }
            maxConsecutive += coin;
        }
        return maxConsecutive + 1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ConsecutiveValuesMaker maker = new ConsecutiveValuesMaker();
        int[] coins1 = {1, 3};
        System.out.println(maker.getMaximumConsecutive(coins1)); // Output: 2

        int[] coins2 = {1, 1, 1, 4};
        System.out.println(maker.getMaximumConsecutive(coins2)); // Output: 8
        
        int[] coins3 = {1, 5, 7, 1, 1, 1};
        System.out.println(maker.getMaximumConsecutive(coins3)); // Output: 17
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is primarily determined by the sorting step:

- **Sorting the array**: `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of coins.
- **Iteration through the array**: `O(n)` for summing up the possible consecutive values.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step, which dominates the linear scan.
