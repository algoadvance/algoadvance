[Leetcode 1239. Maximum Length of a Concatenated String with Unique Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1239)
### Problem Statement

The problem is to find the maximum length of a concatenated string that can be formed using strings from a given list in which all the characters are unique.

- You are given an array of strings `arr`.
- Each string in the array contains only lowercase English letters.
- You need to find and return the maximum possible length of a concatenated string that can be formed such that all the characters in the concatenated string are unique.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Duplicate Strings**: Can the array `arr` contain duplicate strings?
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicate strings, but any duplicates should be treated as separate instances.
   
2. **String Length**: Is there a maximum length for each individual string in `arr`?
   - Each string in `arr` could be assumed to have lengths between 1 and 26 (26 being the maximum since it should not contain duplicate characters).

3. **Array Size**: What is the maximum size of the array `arr`?
   - You can assume the size does not exceed 16, making it feasible to use exhaustive search techniques like DFS or backtracking.

### Strategy

The problem can be approached using backtracking or Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore all possible concatenations of the strings and track the maximum length of a concatenated string with unique characters.

Here’s a systematic approach:

1. **Filter and Transform**: First, filter out any strings that have duplicate characters within themselves, as they can't contribute to a valid concatenated string.
2. **Backtracking/DFS**: Use a backtracking approach to recursively explore all possible concatenations. At each step, maintain a set of characters in the current concatenation and ensure no character is repeated.
3. **Pruning**: Use pruning to cut off branches early if they contain duplicate characters.

### Code
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int maxLength(List<String> arr) {
        List<String> filteredList = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Filter out strings that contain duplicate characters
        for (String str : arr) {
            if (isUnique(str)) {
                filteredList.add(str);
            }
        }
        
        return backtrack(filteredList, 0, "");
    }
    
    private boolean isUnique(String str) {
        int[] charCount = new int[26];
        for (char c : str.toCharArray()) {
            if (++charCount[c - 'a'] > 1) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    private int backtrack(List<String> arr, int start, String current) {
        if (!isUnique(current)) {
            return 0;
        }
        int maxLength = current.length();
        for (int i = start; i < arr.size(); i++) {
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, backtrack(arr, i + 1, current + arr.get(i)));
        }
        return maxLength;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        List<String> arr = Arrays.asList("un", "iq", "ue");
        System.out.println(sol.maxLength(arr));  // Output: 4
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Filtering**: Checking each string for uniqueness involves a check for each character, making it `O(K)` for each string, where `K` is the average length of the strings. For `N` strings, this results in `O(N*K)`.
2. **Backtracking/DFS**: In the worst case, we explore all subsets of length `N`, leading to `O(2^N)` recursive calls. For each recursive call, creating a new concatenated string might take up to `O(N*K)`.

Combining these gives a time complexity in worst case as `O(N*K + 2^N * N*K)`.

While this might seem high, given the constraints (size of `arr` ≤ 16), it is feasible.

Thus, this approach efficiently solves the problem within reasonable limits.
