[Leetcode 2949. Count Beautiful Substrings II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2949)
### Problem Statement
You are given a binary string `s` which consists only of the characters '0' and '1'. A substring is called a "beautiful" substring if it has an equal number of '0's and '1's. You need to count the number of beautiful substrings in `s`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the length of the binary string `s`?**
   - The length isn't specified, so we'll assume it can be large, possibly in the range of typical constraints for strings in coding challenges (e.g., up to \(10^5\)).
2. **Is there any constraint on the substring length?**
   - No constraints on substring length except that it must have an equal number of '0's and '1's.
3. **Should the substrings be contiguous?**
   - Yes, substrings should be contiguous parts of the original string.

Ensure there are no edge cases that need handling like all '0's or all '1's resulting in zero beautiful substrings.

### Strategy
The plan is to use a cumulative sum to keep track of the difference between the number of '0's and '1's encountered as we iterate through the string. The difference between cumulative sums at two indices can tell us if a substring between these two indices is "beautiful".

1. Initialize a counter for the cumulative sum difference.
2. Use a hashmap to store the frequency of each cumulative sum difference encountered.
3. As we iterate through the string, update the cumulative sum difference and count the number of previous indices where the same cumulative sum difference was encountered (indicating an equal number of '0's and '1's).

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public int countBeautifulSubstrings(String s) {
        int count = 0;    // to count the number of beautiful substrings
        int balance = 0;  // cumulative sum balance
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> balanceCount = new HashMap<>();
        
        // initially, balance of 0 (no characters processed) occurs once
        balanceCount.put(0, 1);
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            // update the balance
            balance += (c == '0') ? 1 : -1;
            
            // if 'balance' is seen before, then all substrings between previous 
            // occurrences of this balance and this point are beautiful
            if (balanceCount.containsKey(balance)) {
                count += balanceCount.get(balance);
            }
            
            // update the balance count map
            balanceCount.put(balance, balanceCount.getOrDefault(balance, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        
        // Example test cases
        System.out.println(sol.countBeautifulSubstrings("00110011")); // Expected output: 6
        System.out.println(sol.countBeautifulSubstrings("10101")); // Expected output: 4
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string. This is because we make a single pass through the string and perform constant-time operations for each character.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) in the worst case, where the cumulative balance values are unique and we store them all in the hashmap.

This approach ensures an efficient solution using the cumulative balance and hashmap to track the beautiful substrings.
