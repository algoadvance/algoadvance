[Leetcode 2328. Number of Increasing Paths in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2328)
### Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` matrix `grid`, your task is to count the number of strictly increasing paths and return this count modulo `10^9 + 7`. A path is defined as strictly increasing if each subsequent element is greater than the previous one and paths can move in any of the four directions (up, down, left, right).

### Clarifying Questions

- **Q:** What are the constraints on the matrix dimensions `m` and `n`?
  - **A:** Typically, these constraints are provided in the problem description. For this case, we can assume `1 <= m, n <= 1000`.

- **Q:** Can the matrix contain negative numbers or is it restricted to positive integers?
  - **A:** The matrix can contain any integers, both positive and negative.

- **Q:** Are diagonal movements allowed?
  - **A:** No, diagonal movements are not allowed. Only up, down, left, and right movements are permitted.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization:** We can use a depth-first search (DFS) combined with memoization to efficiently count the increasing paths starting from each cell.
2. **DFS Traversal:** For each cell in the grid, perform a DFS to explore all possible increasing paths.
3. **Memoization:** Use a 2D array to store results of subproblems, i.e., the number of increasing paths starting from a particular cell to avoid redundant calculations.
4. **Modulo Operation:** Given the constraint of the problem, we need to return the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

class Solution {
    private static final int MOD = 1000000007;
    private int[][] directions = // use example from above
    private int[][] memo;
    private int rows, cols;

    public int countPaths(int[][] grid) {
        rows = grid.length;
        cols = grid[0].length;
        memo = new int[rows][cols];

        // Initialize memoization table with -1
        for (int[] row : memo) {
            Arrays.fill(row, -1);
        }

        int totalPaths = 0;

        // Calculate the number of increasing paths starting from each cell
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                totalPaths = (totalPaths + dfs(grid, i, j)) % MOD;
            }
        }

        return totalPaths;
    }

    private int dfs(int[][] grid, int row, int col) {
        // Check if the result is already computed
        if (memo[row][col] != -1) {
            return memo[row][col];
        }

        int paths = 1; // The cell itself is a path of length 1

        // Explore all four possible directions
        for (int[] direction : directions) {
            int newRow = row + direction[0];
            int newCol = col + direction[1];

            // Check if the new position is within grid bounds and the path is strictly increasing
            if (newRow >= 0 && newRow < rows && newCol >= 0 && newCol < cols && grid[newRow][newCol] > grid[row][col]) {
                paths = (paths + dfs(grid, newRow, newCol)) % MOD;
            }
        }

        memo[row][col] = paths;
        return paths;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n)` for filling the memoization table because each cell is visited once and each DFS call operates in constant time after the initial visit.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(m * n)` for the memoization table and the call stack for DFS, which in the worst case can be as deep as `O(m * n)` in case of a single long path.

Feel free to ask any more clarifying questions or for further optimizations!
