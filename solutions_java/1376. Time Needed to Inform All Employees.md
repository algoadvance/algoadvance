[Leetcode 1376. Time Needed to Inform All Employees](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1376)
### Problem Statement

You are given a company structure represented as follows:
- There is a company with `n` employees with unique IDs from `0` to `n-1`.
- The head of the company has an ID of `headID`.
- Each employee has a direct manager (except for the head of the company).
- You are given a manager array where `manager[i]` is the direct manager of the `i-th` employee, and `manager[headID] = -1`.
- You are also given an informTime array where `informTime[i]` is the time it takes for employee `i` to inform all their direct subordinates.
- Your task is to find the total time needed for the head of the company to inform all employees in the company.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be returned if there are no employees except the head?**
   - The returned time should be `0` since no one else needs to be informed.
   
2. **Can there be cycles in the management structure?**
   - No, assume the management structure is a valid tree with a single root.

3. **Is there only one head of the company?**
   - Yes, and the head is indicated as `headID`.

### Strategy

1. **Build Tree Structure**:
   - Use a HashMap to represent the tree structure. The key is the manager and the value is a list of their direct subordinates.

2. **Depth First Search (DFS)**:
   - Start the traversal from the head of the company, and use DFS to calculate the total time taken.
   - For each employee, calculate the maximum time required to inform all their subordinates.

3. **Recursive Calculation**:
   - For each employee, traverse all their subordinates and sum up the time taken by the subordinates, adding the inform time of the current employee.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int numOfMinutes(int n, int headID, int[] manager, int[] informTime) {
        // Build the tree structure from the manager array
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> tree = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (manager[i] != -1) {
                tree.computeIfAbsent(manager[i], k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(i);
            }
        }
        
        // Perform DFS to calculate the total time to inform all employees
        return dfs(headID, tree, informTime);
    }
    
    private int dfs(int currentID, Map<Integer, List<Integer>> tree, int[] informTime) {
        // If the current employee has no subordinates
        if (!tree.containsKey(currentID)) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int maxTime = 0;
        // Traverse all subordinates to calculate the maximum inform time required
        for (int subordinate : tree.get(currentID)) {
            maxTime = Math.max(maxTime, dfs(subordinate, tree, informTime));
        }
        
        // Return the total time for current employee to inform all subordinates
        return informTime[currentID] + maxTime;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Building the Tree Structure**: `O(n)` because we iterate over the `manager` array once.
- **DFS Traversal**: `O(n)` because in the worst case, every node (employee) will be visited once.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n)`, and the space complexity is also `O(n)` due to the storage used for the tree and call stack during DFS.

By structuring the solution this way, we ensure an efficient traversal and calculation of the total inform time.
