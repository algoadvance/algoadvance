[Leetcode 1921. Eliminate Maximum Number of Monsters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1921)
### Problem Statement
- **Title:** Eliminate Maximum Number of Monsters
- **Description:** 
    You are given an array `dist` of integers where `dist[i]` represents the distance of the ith monster from the city, and another array `speed` of integers where `speed[i]` represents the speed of the ith monster. The monsters advance towards the city at their respective speeds. The city has a defense system that allows you to destroy one monster per minute. As soon as a monster reaches the city, the city gets destroyed. Your goal is to maximize the number of monsters that can be eliminated before any monster reaches the city.
    
    **Constraints:**
    - `1 <= dist.length == speed.length <= 10^5`
    - `1 <= dist[i], speed[i] <= 10^9`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are the distances and speeds guaranteed to be positive integers?
   **A:** Yes, as per the constraints.
2. **Q:** Can multiple monsters reach the city at the same time?
   **A:** Yes, if they have the same time to reach the city based on their distances and speeds.

### Strategy
1. **Calculate Time to Reach the City:**
   - For each monster, calculate the time it takes to reach the city as `time[i] = dist[i] / speed[i]`.
   
2. **Sort by Arrival Time:**
   - Sort the monsters based on their `time` to reach the city in ascending order.

3. **Eliminate Monsters in order:**
   - Starting from the monster with the least time, eliminate one monster per minute and keep track of the time elapsed.
   - For each monster, check whether the elapsed time is less than their arrival time. If it is, eliminate the monster; otherwise, break the loop.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int eliminateMaximum(int[] dist, int[] speed) {
        int n = dist.length;
        
        // Calculate the time it takes for each monster to reach the city.
        double[] timeToCity = new double[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            timeToCity[i] = (double) dist[i] / speed[i];
        }
        
        // Sort the times in ascending order.
        Arrays.sort(timeToCity);
        
        // Eliminate monsters in order of their arrival time.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i >= timeToCity[i]) {
                return i; // Monsters reach the city before we can eliminate i-th monster.
            }
        }
        
        return n; // Able to eliminate all monsters.
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Calculating time to reach:** O(n)
- **Sorting:** O(n log n)
- **Eliminating monsters:** O(n)
  
Thus, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is **O(n log n)** due to the sorting step.
