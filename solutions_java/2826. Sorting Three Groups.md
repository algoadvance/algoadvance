[Leetcode 2826. Sorting Three Groups](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2826)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` consisting of integers, which represents several papers. Each paper can belong to one of three groups, labeled with numbers 1, 2, and 3. We want to sort the array such that all papers belonging to group 1 come first, followed by those belonging to group 2, and finally those belonging to group 3.

Implement a function that sorts the array `nums` in place such that the papers are sorted as described.

*Example:*
- Input: nums = [3, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1]
- Output: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the `nums` array contain numbers other than 1, 2, and 3?
   - No, it only contains 1, 2, and 3.
2. What should be the expected time and space complexity for the solution?
   - We should aim for O(n) time complexity and O(1) additional space complexity since we can sort the array in place.
3. Are there any constraints on the length of the array?
   - Yes, typically `1 <= nums.length <= 100000`.

## Strategy

A well-known algorithm for solving this problem with O(n) time complexity and O(1) space complexity is the Dutch National Flag problem algorithm, also known as the three-way partitioning method. 

Here's the strategy:
1. Maintain three pointers: `low`, `mid`, and `high`.
2. Initialize `low` and `mid` to the start of the array and `high` to the end.
3. Iterate over the array with the `mid` pointer:
   - If `nums[mid]` is 1, swap it with the element at the `low` pointer, and increment both `low` and `mid`.
   - If `nums[mid]` is 2, just move the `mid` pointer forward.
   - If `nums[mid]` is 3, swap it with the element at the `high` pointer, and decrement the `high` pointer, but do not move the `mid` pointer forward in this case.

This method ensures that all 1s are moved to the beginning, all 3s are moved to the end, and all 2s stay in the middle.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public void sortThreeGroups(int[] nums) {
        int low = 0, mid = 0, high = nums.length - 1;
        
        while (mid <= high) {
            if (nums[mid] == 1) {
                swap(nums, low, mid);
                low++;
                mid++;
            } else if (nums[mid] == 2) {
                mid++;
            } else { // nums[mid] == 3
                swap(nums, mid, high);
                high--;
            }
        }
    }
    
    private void swap(int[] nums, int i, int j) {
        int temp = nums[i];
        nums[i] = nums[j];
        nums[j] = temp;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n) since we are essentially passing through the array once.
- The space complexity is O(1) as we are using only a few additional integer variables and modifying the array in place. 

This ensures that the provided solution is efficient and meets the problem constraints.
