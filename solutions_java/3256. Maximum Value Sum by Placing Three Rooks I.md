[Leetcode 3256. Maximum Value Sum by Placing Three Rooks I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3256)
### Problem Statement
Given a `3 x 3` chessboard with some cells containing integers and others empty, place 3 rooks on the chessboard such that their sum is maximized. Rooks can attack any position in the same row or column, so no two rooks can be on the same row or column.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the cells that are initially filled with integers guaranteed to have non-negative values?
2. Is it possible for some cells to contain negative values or should we assume all values are zero and above?
3. Should the input be taken as a `2D array` of size `3x3`?
4. Can we assume that the input is always valid (i.e., always exactly a `3x3` array)?

Once these points are clarified, we can proceed with the solution.

### Strategy
The size of the board (`3x3`) allows us to leverage brute force methods because there are only 6 possible ways to place 3 Rooks on different rows and columns. Given the constraints, we can:
1. Generate all permutations of rows for the Rooks.
2. For each permutation, calculate the sum of the elements where the Rooks are placed.
3. Track the maximum sum across all permutations.

### Code
Below is the Java code to solve this problem:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MaximumValueSumByPlacingThreeRooks {
    public static int maxSum(int[][] board) {
        int[] columns = {0, 1, 2}; // There are 3 columns indexed 0, 1, 2
        int maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        
        // Generate all permutations of 3 columns
        do {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
                sum += board[i][columns[i]];
            }
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, sum);
        } while (nextPermutation(columns));
        
        return maxSum;
    }
    
    // Generate next permutation in lexicographical order
    private static boolean nextPermutation(int[] array) {
        int i = array.length - 2;
        while (i >= 0 && array[i] >= array[i + 1]) i--;
        if (i == -1) return false;
        
        int j = array.length - 1;
        while (array[j] <= array[i]) j--;
        swap(array, i, j);
        
        reverse(array, i + 1, array.length - 1);
        return true;
    }
    
    private static void swap(int[] array, int i, int j) {
        int temp = array[i];
        array[i] = array[j];
        array[j] = temp;
    }
    
    private static void reverse(int[] array, int i, int j) {
        while (i < j) {
            int temp = array[i];
            array[i] = array[j];
            array[j] = temp;
            i++;
            j--;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] board = {
            {5, 3, 8},
            {1, 9, 7},
            {4, 6, 2}
        };

        System.out.println(maxSum(board)); // Expected output: 22 (choosing the cells with 5, 9, and 8)
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution can be broken down as follows:
- Generating all permutations of the 3 columns: `O(3!)`, which is `O(6)`.
- Calculating the sum for each permutation: `O(3)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(3! * 3) = O(18)`, which simplifies to `O(1)` due to the constant size of the permutations (only 6 permutations of 3 elements).

This algorithm is efficient and optimal given the fixed size of the chessboard.
