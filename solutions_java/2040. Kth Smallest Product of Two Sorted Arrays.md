[Leetcode 2040. Kth Smallest Product of Two Sorted Arrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2040)
### Problem Statement
Given two sorted 0-indexed integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` as well as an integer `k`, return the `k`th smallest product of `nums1[i] * nums2[j]` where `0 <= i < nums1.length` and `0 <= j < nums2.length`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the range of values for elements in `nums1` and `nums2`?
    - What is the range of values for `k`?

2. **Output Specifications**:
    - Should the output be the product value or the indices `(i, j)`?

3. **Duplicates**:
    - Are there duplicates in the arrays, and how should they be handled?

4. **Edge Cases**:
    - How should the function handle cases where `nums1` or `nums2` is empty?

### Strategy
1. **Initial Approach**:
    - Utilize a combination of binary search with a counting technique to efficiently find the k-th smallest product.
    - We avoid the naive method of generating all possible products since it would be computationally expensive with time complexity O(n * m) in the worst-case scenario.

2. **Binary Search**:
    - Define the range of possible products by using the minimum and maximum possible products of elements from both arrays.
    - Use binary search within this range to find the smallest product such that there are at least `k` products smaller than or equal to it.

3. **Counting Function**:
    - Implement a helper function that for a given product `mid`, counts how many products are less than or equal to `mid`.
    - This can be done in linear time relative to the length of the arrays by leveraging their sorted nature.

### Code
```java
public class KthSmallestProduct {
    
    public long kthSmallestProduct(int[] nums1, int[] nums2, int k) {
        long left = (long) nums1[0] * nums2[0];
        long right = (long) nums1[nums1.length - 1] * nums2[nums2.length - 1];
        
        while (left < right) {
            long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (countLessEqual(nums1, nums2, mid) < k) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        
        return left;
    }
    
    private long countLessEqual(int[] nums1, int[] nums2, long x) {
        long count = 0;
        for (int num : nums1) {
            if (num > 0) {
                count += countLessEqualPositive(nums2, x / num);
            } else if (num < 0) {
                count += countLessEqualNegative(nums2, x / num);
            } else {
                if (x >= 0) {
                    count += nums2.length;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    private long countLessEqualPositive(int[] nums, long x) {
        int left = 0, right = nums.length;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] <= x) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }

    private long countLessEqualNegative(int[] nums, long x) {
        int left = 0, right = nums.length;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (nums[mid] * x >= 0 && nums[mid] >= x) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return nums.length - right;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        KthSmallestProduct solution = new KthSmallestProduct();
        int[] nums1 = {1, 7};
        int[] nums2 = {3, 4};
        int k = 3;
        System.out.println(solution.kthSmallestProduct(nums1, nums2, k)); // Output: 21
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Binary Search**: O(log(max - min)), where `max` and `min` are the maximum and minimum possible product values.
- **Counting Function**: O(n + m), where `n` is the length of `nums1` and `m` is the length of `nums2`.
- **Overall**: The time complexity is O((n + m) * log(max - min)), which is more efficient than the naive O(n * m) approach.
