[Leetcode 207. Course Schedule full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l207)
## Problem Statement
You are given a list of courses you need to take, labeled from `0` to `n-1`. Some courses may have prerequisites, where taking course `i` requires taking course `j` first. Given the total number of courses and a list of prerequisite pairs, determine if it is possible for you to finish all courses.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: numCourses = 2, prerequisites = [[1,0]]
Output: true
Explanation: There are a total of 2 courses. To take course 1 you should have finished course 0. So it is possible.
```

### Constraints:
- The input prerequisites are represented as a list of pairs `[a, b]`, where `a` requires `b` to be taken first.
- You may assume that prerequisites are valid and form a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

### Clarifying Questions
1. What should be the output if there are no courses (i.e., `numCourses = 0`)?
   - It should return `true` since there are no courses to take.
2. Can there be duplicate pairs in the prerequisites list?
   - For simplicity, you can assume there are no duplicate pairs.

## Strategy
To determine if all courses can be completed, we must detect if there is a cycle in the directed graph formed by the course prerequisites. If there is a cycle, it is impossible to finish all courses.

We can use Depth First Search (DFS) to detect cycles in the graph. Here are the steps:
1. Create an adjacency list representation of the graph from prerequisites.
2. Use a recursive DFS approach to check for cycles.
3. Mark each node with three states: 
   - `0` for unvisited,
   - `1` for being visited (part of the current DFS path),
   - `2` for fully visited (no cycle detected for this node).

## Code
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public boolean canFinish(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites) {
        List<List<Integer>> adjList = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            adjList.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }

        for (int[] pair : prerequisites) {
            adjList.get(pair[1]).add(pair[0]);
        }

        int[] visited = new int[numCourses]; // 0 = unvisited, 1 = visiting, 2 = visited

        for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
            if (dfs(i, adjList, visited)) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }

    private boolean dfs(int node, List<List<Integer>> adjList, int[] visited) {
        if (visited[node] == 1) {
            return true; // Cycle detected
        }
        if (visited[node] == 2) {
            return false; // Already fully processed node
        
        visited[node] = 1; // Mark the node as being visited

        for (int neighbor : adjList.get(node)) {
            if (dfs(neighbor, adjList, visited)) {
                return true; // Cycle detected
            }
        }

        visited[node] = 2; // Mark the node as fully processed
        return false;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- Constructing the adjacency list takes `O(E)` time where `E` is the number of prerequisite pairs.
- The DFS traversal of the graph will take `O(V + E)` where `V` is the number of courses.

Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(V + E)`.

## Space Complexity
- Adjacency list uses `O(V + E)` space.
- The visited array uses `O(V)` space.
- The recursion stack in the worst case can go up to `O(V)` depth.

Thus, the space complexity is `O(V + E)`.
