[Leetcode 2611. Mice and Cheese](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2611)
## Problem Statement:

You are given two arrays of integers, `reward1` and `reward2`, each of length `n`. You are also given an integer `k`.

You are playing a game involving `n` mice and `n` pieces of cheese. All the mice are considered identical. Each piece of cheese gets exactly one mouse, and each mouse will exactly eat one piece of cheese.

A mouse eating a piece of cheese at index `i` will get a reward of:

- `reward1[i]` if the mouse eats the `i-th` piece of cheese for the first time.
- `reward2[i]` if the mouse eats the `i-th` piece of cheese for the second time.

Return the **maximum** reward you can achieve if you distribute the pieces of cheese optimally.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. Can `reward1` and `reward2` contain negative values?
2. Is there always exactly one distribution that gives maximum reward, or are there ties possible?
3. What should be done if the value of `k` is larger or smaller than `n`?
4. Are the arrays guaranteed to be of equal length?

## Strategy:

To maximize the reward, we can take the following approach:

1. Calculate the difference in reward if a mouse eats the `i-th` piece of cheese first rather than second: `diff[i] = reward1[i] - reward2[i]`.
2. Sort the `diff` array in descending order. This allows us to determine the pieces of cheese that provide the most benefit when eaten first.
3. Sum the rewards:
   - Pick the top `k` pieces of cheese from the `diff` array based on the sorted order (maximum difference in favor of `reward1`).
   - For these pieces, add `reward1[i]` to the total reward.
   - For the remaining pieces (those not in the top `k`), add `reward2[i]` to the total reward.

This method ensures we are choosing the placement of the first `k` pieces in a way that maximizes the overall reward.

## Code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MiceAndCheese {
    public int maxReward(int[] reward1, int[] reward2, int k) {
        int n = reward1.length;
        
        // Array to store the difference between reward1 and reward2 for each piece of cheese
        int[] diff = new int[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            diff[i] = reward1[i] - reward2[i];
        }

        // Sort the diff array in descending order along with indices
        Integer[] indices = new Integer[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            indices[i] = i;
        }
        Arrays.sort(indices, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(diff[b], diff[a]));

        // Calculate the maximum reward
        int maxReward = 0;

        // Use a set to remember indexes picked
        Set<Integer> pickedIndexes = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            maxReward += reward1[indices[i]];
            pickedIndexes.add(indices[i]);
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!pickedIndexes.contains(i)) {
                maxReward += reward2[i];
            }
        }

        return maxReward;
    }

    // Example usage
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MiceAndCheese mc = new MiceAndCheese();
        int[] reward1 = {1, 4, 3};
        int[] reward2 = {2, 6, 3};
        int k = 2;
        System.out.println(mc.maxReward(reward1, reward2, k)); // Expected Output: 10
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:

1. Calculating the differences: O(n)
2. Sorting the differences: O(n log n)
3. Calculating the max reward: O(n)

Total time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting step, which is the most time-consuming part of the algorithm.
