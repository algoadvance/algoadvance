[Leetcode 2217. Find Palindrome With Fixed Length](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2217)
## Problem Statement
You are given two integers, `n` and `k`. You need to return the `k-th` smallest palindrome of the length `n`. 

For example, given `n = 3` and `k = 2`, the 2nd smallest palindrome of length 3 is "111".

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Values:**
   - What is the expected range of `n` and `k`?
   - Can `n` be zero?
2. **Output Format:**
   - Do we need to return the palindrome in string format?
3. **Constraints:**
   - Are there any specific constraints we need to abide by regarding computation time or space?

If no constraints are given explicitly, we will assume reasonable ranges for `n` and `k`, and that the output should be a string representation of the palindrome.

## Strategy
1. **Palindrome Characteristics:**
   - For an integer of length `n`, a palindrome implies a symmetric structure with respect to its center.
   - If `n` is odd, the middle digit does not need a pair; for even `n`, every digit must have a corresponding pair.

2. **Palindrome Generation:**
   - To generate the k-th smallest palindrome of a given length `n`, we can focus on constructing the first half of the palindrome and then mirror it to form the second half.

3. **Indexed Palindrome Calculation:**
   - For `n` = 3 and `k` = 2, we find that small palindromes are "101", "111", "121", etc. We take the k-th such palindrome directly.

4. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Compute the half-length: if `n` is odd, include one more digit for the middle part. Otherwise, take the first half directly.
   - Generate the base palindrome using the start of the numeric sequence and mirror it as required.

## Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public String kthPalindrome(int n, int k) {
        int halfLen = (n + 1) / 2; // Compute the half length, accounting for odd length palindromes
        int start = (int) Math.pow(10, halfLen - 1); // Starting number for the first half
        int num = start + k - 1; // Get the k-th number in the sequence

        // Convert the number to string for easier manipulation
        String firstHalf = Integer.toString(num); 
        
        // Prepare the second half as a reverse of the appropriate prefix of the first half
        String secondHalf = new StringBuilder(firstHalf).reverse().substring(n % 2);
        
        // Construct the full palindrome by concatenating the two halves
        return firstHalf + secondHalf;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(log(k))` for computing the necessary numbers and converting them to strings, which is efficient for practical input sizes.

- **String Manipulations:** StringBuilder and substring operations take linear time based on the length, which is manageable within this context with a fixed small length `n`.
- **Arithmetic Operations:** Basic arithmetic and logarithmic computations are constant in practical scenarios.

This approach ensures we generate the k-th smallest palindrome effectively by focusing on constructing half and mirroring it, keeping the performance optimal for competitive coding scenarios.
