[Leetcode 1814. Count Nice Pairs in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1814)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` that consists of non-negative integers. Letâ€™s define a "nice pair" `(i, j)` such that:

- `0 <= i < j < nums.length`
- `nums[i] + rev(nums[j]) == nums[j] + rev(nums[i])`

Where `rev(x)` is the reverse of integer `x`.

Return the number of nice pairs in the array.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [42,11,1,97]
Output: 2

Explanation: The two pairs are:
    - (0, 3): nums[0] + rev(nums[3]) = 42 + 79 = 97 + 24
    - (1, 2): nums[1] + rev(nums[2]) = 11 + 1 = 1 + 11
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

---

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we do if the length of `nums` is 1?**
   - Since no pair can be formed, the result should be 0.

2. **Is reversing the integer considered as reversing the digits?**
   - Yes, reversing the integer means reversing the digits of the integer.

3. **Do we need to handle the input being invalid (e.g., containing negative numbers)?**
   - No, based on the constraints, the input will always be non-negative integers.

---

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we need to observe that the condition `nums[i] + rev(nums[j]) == nums[j] + rev(nums[i])` is equivalent to stating:
`nums[i] - rev(nums[i]) == nums[j] - rev(nums[j])`.

This insight simplifies the problem: instead of comparing pairs of elements, we can transform the array and count the frequencies of these differences `delta = nums[i] - rev(nums[i])`.

Our steps will be:
1. Iterate through the array and calculate `delta` for each element.
2. Use a hashmap to count the occurrences of each `delta`.
3. For each unique `delta`, the number of ways to pick pairs is given by the combination formula `C(n, 2) = n * (n - 1) / 2`.

### Implementation Steps

1. Define a function to reverse an integer.
2. Iterate through the array to compute `delta` and use a hashmap to store the frequencies.
3. Iterate through the hashmap to sum up the number of nice pairs, taking modulo `10^9 + 7` to handle large outputs.

## Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    private static final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;

    public int countNicePairs(int[] nums) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        long count = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            int revNum = reverse(num);
            int delta = num - revNum;

            count = (count + map.getOrDefault(delta, 0)) % MOD;
            map.put(delta, map.getOrDefault(delta, 0) + 1);
        }

        return (int) count;
    }

    private int reverse(int num) {
        int rev = 0;
        while (num != 0) {
            rev = rev * 10 + num % 10;
            num /= 10;
        }
        return rev;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {42, 11, 1, 97};
        System.out.println(solution.countNicePairs(nums)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n * d)` where `n` is the length of the input array and `d` is the number of digits in the largest number (to reverse it). In the worst case, this is `O(n * 10)` which is effectively `O(n)`.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for the hashmap to store the frequency of the `delta` values.

This approach efficiently counts nice pairs using the key insight about the `delta` transformation.
