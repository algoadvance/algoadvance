[Leetcode 3129. Find All Possible Stable Binary Arrays I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3129)
## Problem Statement

You are given two integers `n` and `k`. A binary array is an array consisting of only `0`s or `1`s.

A binary array of length `n` is stable if and only if the following conditions are met:
- The first element is `0`.
- The number of contiguous subarrays of length `k` that contain only `1`s is equal to the number of contiguous subarrays of length `k` that contain only `0`s.

Return *all possible stable binary arrays of length `n`*. You can return the answer in any order.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints:**
   - What is the range of `n` and `k`?
   - Are there any restrictions on the maximum size of the output?

2. **Output Format:**
   - Should the output be a list of lists, with each list representing a valid binary array?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - How should the solution handle cases where `k` is greater than `n` (since no contiguous subarray of length `k` can exist in an array of length `n`)?
   - What if `k` is 0 or 1?
   - Can the solution assume that there will always be at least one valid stable binary array?

Understanding these details will help us ensure the implementation is correct and efficient.

## Strategy

To solve the problem, we need to consider the following steps:

1. **Generate a Binary Array with Fixed Length**:
   - The array needs to start with a `0`.
  
2. **Ensure Stability Conditions**:
   - For every contiguous subarray of length `k` that has only `1`s, there should be another subarray of length `k` that contains only `0`s. This constraint must hold throughout the array.
  
3. **Iterate Possible Combinations**:
   - Generate all possible binary arrays of length `n`, and then check each array to see if it meets the stability condition.

Due to potentially large number of arrays, we might need an efficient approach for generating only those arrays that satisfy our conditions.

## Code

The code implements a strategy to generate valid stable arrays recursively:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class StableBinaryArrays {

    public static List<int[]> findAllStableBinaryArrays(int n, int k) {
        List<int[]> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int[] array = new int[n];

        // Start the recursion with the first element fixed to 0
        if (n > 0) {
            array[0] = 0;
            generateStableArrays(array, 1, k, result);
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    private static void generateStableArrays(int[] array, int position, int k, List<int[]> result) {
        if (position == array.length) {
            // Check if the array is stable
            if (isStable(array, k)) {
                result.add(array.clone());
            }
            return;
        }

        // Try placing 0 and 1 at the current position recursively
        array[position] = 0;
        generateStableArrays(array, position + 1, k, result);
        
        array[position] = 1;
        generateStableArrays(array, position + 1, k, result);
    }

    private static boolean isStable(int[] array, int k) {
        int countOnes = 0, countZeros = 0;

        // Count contiguous subarrays of length k that are all 1s or all 0s
        for (int i = 0; i <= array.length - k; i++) {
            boolean allOnes = true, allZeros = true;
            for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
                if (array[i + j] != 1) allOnes = false;
                if (array[i + j] != 0) allZeros = false;
            }
            if (allOnes) countOnes++;
            if (allZeros) countZeros++;
        }
        return countOnes == countZeros;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 4, k = 2;
        List<int[]> result = findAllStableBinaryArrays(n, k);
        
        for (int[] array : result) {
            for (int num : array) {
                System.out.print(num + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of generating all binary arrays of length `n` is \( O(2^n) \). However, not all generated arrays will be stable, so the final list will contain only those arrays that meet the stability condition. The main bottleneck is checking the stability of each generated array, which in the worst case can be \( O(n \cdot k) \), making the overall complexity approximately \( O(n \cdot k \cdot 2^n) \).

This approach is brute-force and may not be optimal for larger values of `n`. Further optimization could be explored by pruning invalid arrays early or leveraging dynamic programming to keep track of valid configurations.
