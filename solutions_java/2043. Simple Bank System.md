[Leetcode 2043. Simple Bank System](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2043)
### Problem Statement
Design a simple bank system to handle operations on several bank accounts. The system should support the following operations:
1. Query the balance of a specific account.
2. Deposit money into a specific account.
3. Withdraw money from a specific account.
4. Transfer money between two accounts.

Given the initial balances of the bank accounts and a list of operations, implement the design of the class `Bank` to handle these operations efficiently.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should happen if an operation (such as a transfer or withdrawal) cannot be completed due to insufficient funds or invalid account numbers?**
   - Return `false` if an operation cannot be completed.

2. **How many accounts will the system have to handle?**
   - The number of accounts `n` will be provided via constructor input.

3. **What data structures should we use for the account details?**
   - Use an array to maintain account balances.

4. **What are the constraints on the account numbers?**
   - Accounts are 1-indexed, i.e., account numbers start from 1.

5. **Should we assume the input is always valid (i.e., operations only performed on valid accounts)?**
   - No, we should handle invalid operations as specified.

### Strategy
1. **Initialize the Bank System:**
   - Use an array `balances` where the index represents the account numbers (1 to `n`).

2. **Implement Operations:**
   - **Query Balance:** Check the account number validity and return the corresponding balance.
   - **Deposit:** Check account validity and update the balance accordingly.
   - **Withdraw:** Check account validity and ensure sufficient funds before proceeding.
   - **Transfer:** Validate both accounts and ensure sufficient funds before completing the transfer.

### Code
```java
class Bank {
    private long[] balance;

    public Bank(long[] balance) {
        this.balance = balance;
    }

    public boolean transfer(int account1, int account2, long money) {
        if (!isValidAccount(account1) || !isValidAccount(account2)) {
            return false;
        }
        if (balance[account1 - 1] < money) {
            return false;
        }
        balance[account1 - 1] -= money;
        balance[account2 - 1] += money;
        return true;
    }

    public boolean deposit(int account, long money) {
        if (!isValidAccount(account)) {
            return false;
        }
        balance[account - 1] += money;
        return true;
    }

    public boolean withdraw(int account, long money) {
        if (!isValidAccount(account) || balance[account - 1] < money) {
            return false;
        }
        balance[account - 1] -= money;
        return true;
    }

    private boolean isValidAccount(int account) {
        return account >= 1 && account <= balance.length;
    }
}

// Example Usage:
// Bank bank = new Bank(new long[]{10, 100, 20, 50, 30});
// bank.withdraw(3, 10);   // true
// bank.transfer(5, 1, 20); // true
// bank.deposit(5, 20);    // true
// bank.transfer(3, 4, 15); // false
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Initialization:** O(n), where `n` is the number of accounts.
2. **Each Operation (transfer, deposit, withdraw):** O(1), constant time operations.

This design ensures that the operations are handled efficiently, as each operation involves a fixed number of steps regardless of the number of accounts.
