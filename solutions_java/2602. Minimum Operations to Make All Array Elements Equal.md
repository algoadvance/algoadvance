[Leetcode 2602. Minimum Operations to Make All Array Elements Equal full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2602)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array `nums` and an integer `k`. In one operation, you can increment or decrement an element of the array by `k`. Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to make all elements of the array equal.

#### Example
- Input: `nums = [2, 8, 6, 5]`, `k = 2`
- Output: `5`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Element Range:**
   - What is the range of the elements in the array?
   - **Assumption:** Elements can range from a large negative number to a large positive number.

2. **Array Length:**
   - What is the expected size of the array?
   - **Assumption:** The array can be of large size, possibly up to `10^5`.

3. **Value for Equality:**
   - How do we decide which value the elements need to be converted into?
   - **Assumption:** We need to determine the best candidate value, which can be any integer.

4. **Constraints on `k`:**
   - Can `k` be any positive integer?
   - **Assumption:** Yes, `k` is a positive integer and provided as input.

### Strategy
1. **Modular Arithmetic Insight:** Because the operation allowed is incrementing or decrementing by `k`, all numbers can be considered equivalent modulo `k`. Therefore, for numbers to be made equal, they must become congruent modulo `k`.

2. **Transform and Standardize:** Convert all elements in `nums` to their respective residues modulo `k`. The minimum number of operations to make all elements equal can be derived by transforming all elements towards a common residue modulo `k`.

3. **Calculate Operations:** Iterate through possible target values of residue (0 to `k-1`) and calculate the cost (number of operations) to make all elements equal to each relevant residue value. Choose the minimal cost.

### Code
```java
public class MinimumOperations {
    public int minimumOperations(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Calculate the minimum operations required to make all elements equal
        
        // Store the residues modulo k
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] residues = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            residues[i] = nums[i] % k; // Get residues (calculate modulo k)
            if (residues[i] < 0) residues[i] += k; // Adjust for negative numbers
        }
        
        // Find the optimal target residue
        int minOperations = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int target = 0; target < k; target++) {
            int currentOps = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                int diff = Math.abs(target - residues[i]);
                currentOps += Math.min(diff, k - diff);
            }
            minOperations = Math.min(minOperations, currentOps);
        }
        return minOperations;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumOperations solution = new MinimumOperations();
        int[] nums = {2, 8, 6, 5};
        int k = 2;
        System.out.println(solution.minimumOperations(nums, k)); // Output: 5
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n \cdot k)\)
    - Calculating residues takes \(O(n)\).
    - Determining the minimal operations cost across all possible target residues requires \(O(n \cdot k)\).

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
    - Space used to store residues is proportional to the size of `nums`.
