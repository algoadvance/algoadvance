### Problem Statement

**1561. Maximum Number of Coins You Can Get**

There are 3n piles of coins of varying size, you and your friends will take piles of coins as follows:

- In each step, you will choose **any** 3 piles of coins (not necessarily consecutive).
- Of your choice, Alice will pick the pile with the maximum number of coins.
- You will pick the next pile with the maximum number of coins.
- Your friend Bob will pick the last pile.
- Repeat until there are no more piles of coins.

Given an array of integers `piles` where `piles[i]` is the number of coins in the i-th pile, return the maximum number of coins you can get.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the number of coins in a pile be zero?**
   - Yes.
  
2. **Are the number of piles guaranteed to be a multiple of 3?**
   - Yes, the number of piles is guaranteed to be a multiple of 3.

3. **How large can the size of the `piles` array be?**
   - The problem definition does not specify, but it would typically fit within the constraints of typical competitive programming limits.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Piles:**
   - First, sort the array in non-decreasing order to facilitate easy extraction of the piles.
   
2. **Select Piles:**
   - After sorting, choose piles starting from the second largest for yourself, skipping every third pile starting from the end.
   
3. **Calculate the Sum: **
   - Summing up these chosen piles will give the maximum number of coins you can get.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int maxCoins(int[] piles) {
        Arrays.sort(piles);
        int n = piles.length / 3; // Since there are 3n piles
        int maxCoins = 0;
        
        // We pick all piles starting from the second largest, skipping every third pile from the end
        for (int i = piles.length - 2; i >= n; i -= 2) {
            maxCoins += piles[i];
        }
        
        return maxCoins;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] piles = {2, 4, 1, 2, 7, 8};
        System.out.println(sol.maxCoins(piles)); // outputs 9
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the Array:** Sorting takes \(O(3n \log (3n)) \approx O(n \log n)\).
- **Iterating through the Array:** We iterate through the sorted array which takes \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

### Explanation

1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - Sorting arranges the piles in non-decreasing order.

2. **Choosing Piles:**
   - Start from the second largest element and skip every second element backwards (because Alice picks the largest, you pick the second largest).
   - By iterating starting from the second last, and decrementing by 2, we ensure Alice picks the largest and Bob picks the smallest at each step.

Combining these, we guarantee the optimal collection of coins based on the given picking order.
