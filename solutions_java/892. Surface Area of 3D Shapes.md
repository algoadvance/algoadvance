[Leetcode 892. Surface Area of 3D Shapes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l892)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `n x n` grid where we have `n` vertical stacks of cubes. Each cell `(i, j)` in the grid represents a vertical stack of cubes that has `grid[i][j]` cubes.

Return the total surface area of the resulting shapes formed by these stacks.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of the dimensions of the grid (`n` x `n`)?
     - Typically, `1 <= n <= 50`.
   - What is the range of values for each cell in the grid (`grid[i][j]`)?
     - Typically, `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 50`.

2. **Surface Area Definition:**
   - How is the surface area calculated?
     - The surface area is calculated as the sum of all exposed faces of all cubes in the grid.

3. **Adjacent Cubes Consideration:**
   - Are adjacent cubes considered to reduce the surface area?
     - Yes, faces between adjacent cubes are not counted towards the surface area.

### Code

Here is a Java solution to compute the total surface area:

```java
public class SurfaceArea3DShapes {
    public int surfaceArea(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        int totalSurfaceArea = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] > 0) {
                    // Add surface area of the stack itself
                    totalSurfaceArea += 2 + grid[i][j] * 4;
                    
                    // Subtract surfaces where adjacent cubes touch
                    if (i > 0) {
                        totalSurfaceArea -= Math.min(grid[i][j], grid[i - 1][j]) * 2;
                    }
                    if (j > 0) {
                        totalSurfaceArea -= Math.min(grid[i][j], grid[i][j - 1]) * 2;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return totalSurfaceArea;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SurfaceArea3DShapes sa = new SurfaceArea3DShapes();
        int[][] grid = {
            {2, 2, 2},
            {2, 1, 2},
            {2, 2, 2}
        };
        System.out.println(sa.surfaceArea(grid)); // Expected surface area
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Initial Surface Area Calculation:**
   - For each stack of cubes, the initial surface area is calculated as `2 + grid[i][j] * 4` (since each cube contributes 4 side faces and the top and bottom faces add 2 more).

2. **Adjust for Touching Adjacent Cubes:**
   - For adjacent stacks in the grid, subtract the surface areas where they touch. This is done by checking neighbors:
     - If there is a stack above (`grid[i-1][j]`), subtract the touching surface area.
     - If there is a stack to the left (`grid[i][j-1]`), subtract the touching surface area.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n^2)` where `n` is the side length of the grid. This is because we are iterating through every cell in an `n x n` grid exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` as we are using a constant amount of additional space.

This approach ensures that you efficiently compute the surface area considering all edge cases and constraints.
