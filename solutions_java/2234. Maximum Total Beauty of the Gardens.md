[Leetcode 2234. Maximum Total Beauty of the Gardens full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2234)
Sure, let's break down the problem and solve it step-by-step.

### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `flowers` representing the number of flowers in each garden. You need to maximize the total beauty of the gardens. The total beauty of a garden is defined as the greatest number of flowers present in any of the gardens. You are allowed to:
1. Pick a garden and transfer any number of flowers to another garden.
2. Perform the above operation exactly once.

You need to return the maximum total beauty that can be achieved by performing the operation exactly once.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can a garden receive more flowers than its initial count?
2. Is the initial state of the gardens considered when calculating the maximum beauty?
3. Do we need to return the total beauty or the position of the garden with the maximum beauty?

### Let's assume the answers to the clarifying questions are as follows:
1. Yes.
2. Yes.
3. We need to return the total maximum beauty.

### Strategy
1. Calculate the initial maximum number of flowers in any garden.
2. For each garden, evaluate the maximum beauty achievable by either transferring flowers from it to another garden or to it from another garden.
3. Keep track of the maximum beauty found during these operations.
4. Return this maximum beauty as the result.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int maxBeauty(int[] flowers) {
        int n = flowers.length;
        if (n == 1) return flowers[0]; // If only one garden, its beauty is the max beauty
        
        int maxInitialBeauty = Arrays.stream(flowers).max().orElse(0);

        int maxBeautyWithTransfer = maxInitialBeauty;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i != j) {
                    int originalI = flowers[i];
                    int originalJ = flowers[j];
                    
                    // Transfer flowers[i] to flowers[j]
                    int newBeauty = Math.max(originalJ + originalI, maxInitialBeauty);
                    // Update max beauty
                    maxBeautyWithTransfer = Math.max(maxBeautyWithTransfer, newBeauty);
                    
                    // Since we need only perform the operation once, we can compare all possible transfers
                }
            }
        }

        return maxBeautyWithTransfer;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solver = new Solution();
        int[] flowers = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        System.out.println(solver.maxBeauty(flowers)); // Expected output is 6
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Initial maximum calculation using `Arrays.stream().max()` runs in O(n).
- Nested loops to evaluate every transfer operation run in O(n^2).
- Overall time complexity of the solution is O(n^2). 

Given this complexity, the solution should be efficient enough for relatively small arrays, but may need optimization for very large input sizes or if performance issues are observed.

If you have any specific constraints like bounds on array size or values, please let me know so I can refine the solution accordingly.
