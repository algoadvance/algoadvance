[Leetcode 24. Swap Nodes in Pairs full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l24)
### Problem Statement
Given a linked list, swap every two adjacent nodes and return its head. You must solve the problem without modifying the values in the list's nodes (i.e., only nodes themselves may be changed).

For example:
- Given `1->2->3->4`, you should return the list as `2->1->4->3`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What happens if there's an odd number of nodes in the linked list?
   - **A:** The last node remains as it is since there is no adjacent node to swap with.
   
2. **Q:** Can the linked list be empty?
   - **A:** Yes, in the case of an empty list, the result should also be an empty list.

3. **Q:** What is the range of the number of nodes in the list?
   - **A:** There can be anywhere from 0 to 100 nodes.

4. **Q:** Can we use additional data structures to assist with the solution?
   - **A:** No, the challenge here is to swap the nodes themselves without using extra space beyond the stack frame in a recursive solution.

### Strategy
1. **Iterative Approach:**
   - Use a dummy node that simplifies edge cases.
   - Traverse the list in pairs and swap nodes.
   - Update pointers accordingly to swap adjacent nodes.

2. **Recursive Approach:**
   - Base case: If there are fewer than two nodes left, return the head.
   - Recursive case: Swap the first two nodes and recursively solve for the rest of the list.

### Code

#### Iterative Approach:

```java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
}

public class Solution {
    public ListNode swapPairs(ListNode head) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;
        ListNode current = dummy;

        while (current.next != null && current.next.next != null) {
            ListNode first = current.next;
            ListNode second = current.next.next;

            // swap
            first.next = second.next;
            second.next = first;
            current.next = second;

            // move current
            current = first;
        }

        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```

#### Recursive Approach:

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode swapPairs(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) {
            return head;
        }
        ListNode first = head;
        ListNode second = head.next;

        first.next = swapPairs(second.next);
        second.next = first;

        return second;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Both the iterative and recursive solutions have a **time complexity** of O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list, because we traverse each node exactly once.
- The **space complexity** for the iterative solution is O(1) since we are not using any extra space aside from a few pointers.
- The **space complexity** for the recursive solution is O(n) due to the recursion stack call.
