[Leetcode 2930. Number of Strings Which Can Be Rearranged to Contain Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2930)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `words` and a string `s`. A string from `words` is considered good if it can be rearranged to contain the substring `s`. Return the number of good strings.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the order of characters in the substring `s` important?**
   - Yes, the substring `s` must appear in the exact order in some permutation of each string in `words`.

2. **Can the strings in `words` be empty?**
   - No, the `words` array contains non-empty strings.

3. **Can the substring `s` be empty?**
   - Not relevant, since an empty substring is trivially a substring of any string.

4. **What is the maximum length of the strings in `words` and `s`?**
   - Assume the length of strings in `words` can be up to \(10^4\) and the length of `s` can be up to \(10^4\).

### Strategy

1. **Requirement Check**:
    - For each string `word` in `words`, check if there is any permutation of `word` that contains the exact substring `s`.

2. **Character Count**:
    - Use character counts to determine if a permutation of `word` can contain `s`. Specifically, `word` must contain at least as many of each character as `s`.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
    - Count the frequency of each character in the substring `s`.
    - For each `word` in `words`, check if the word contains at least the same frequency of each character as `s`.

4. **Efficiency**:
    - Counting characters in `s` and each `word` can be done in linear time relative to their lengths.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m), where n is the number of strings in `words` and m is the average length of the strings and the length of `s`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the character frequency array used for counting characters (constant size since there are only 26 possible lowercase letters).

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class NumberOfGoodStrings {
    
    public int numOfStringsWhichCanBeRearranged(String[] words, String s) {
        // Create a frequency map for the string `s`
        int[] targetFreq = new int[26];
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            targetFreq[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        int goodCount = 0;
        
        for (String word : words) {
            if (canForm(word, targetFreq)) {
                goodCount++;
            }
        }
        
        return goodCount;
    }
    
    private boolean canForm(String word, int[] targetFreq) {
        int[] wordFreq = new int[26];
        
        for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
            wordFreq[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (wordFreq[i] < targetFreq[i]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NumberOfGoodStrings solution = new NumberOfGoodStrings();
        String[] words = {"abc", "abdc", "cadb", "xyza"};
        String s = "abd";
        System.out.println(solution.numOfStringsWhichCanBeRearranged(words, s));  // Output should be 3
    }
}
```

This code defines a method `numOfStringsWhichCanBeRearranged` that counts how many strings in the array `words` can be rearranged to contain the substring `s`. The function `canForm` checks if a given word can be rearranged to contain `s` by comparing character frequencies.
