[Leetcode 1773. Count Items Matching a Rule](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1773)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `items`, where each `items[i] = [typei, colori, namei]` describes the type, color, and name of the ith item. You are also given a rule represented by two strings, `ruleKey` and `ruleValue`.

The `ruleKey` could be either "type", "color", or "name". You need to count the number of items that match the given `ruleKey` and `ruleValue`.

### Example
1. Input: 
   - `items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]]`
   - `ruleKey = "color"`
   - `ruleValue = "silver"`
   
   Output:
   - `1`
   
2. Input:
   - `items = [["phone","blue","pixel"],["computer","silver","lenovo"],["phone","gold","iphone"]]`
   - `ruleKey = "type"`
   - `ruleValue = "phone"`

   Output:
   - `2`

### Clarifying Questions
1. What are the possible values for `ruleKey`?
   - **Answer**: The possible values are "type", "color", and "name".

2. Can the `items` array be empty?
   - **Answer**: Yes, it can be empty. In such a case, the result will be `0`.

3. Are the values in the items consistent and in a fixed format?
   - **Answer**: Yes, each item is represented as a list of three strings `[type, color, name]`.

### Strategy
1. Identify the index corresponding to the `ruleKey`.
   - If `ruleKey` is "type", the index is 0.
   - If `ruleKey` is "color", the index is 1.
   - If `ruleKey` is "name", the index is 2.
   
2. Loop through the `items` list and count the items that match the `ruleValue` for the specified `ruleKey`.

### Code
Here's the implementation in Java:

```java
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public int countMatches(List<List<String>> items, String ruleKey, String ruleValue) {
        int index = -1;
        if ("type".equals(ruleKey)) {
            index = 0;
        } else if ("color".equals(ruleKey)) {
            index = 1;
        } else if ("name".equals(ruleKey)) {
            index = 2;
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        for (List<String> item : items) {
            if (ruleValue.equals(item.get(index))) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of items in the list. This is because we iterate through each item exactly once, performing a constant-time operation for each item.

### Explanation
1. **Determining the index**:
   - The ruleKey determines which attribute of the items we are interested in ("type" -> index 0, "color" -> index 1, "name" -> index 2).

2. **Counting matches**:
   - We iterate over each item in the `items` list.
   - We check if the attribute at the determined index matches the `ruleValue`.
   - We keep a count of such matches.
   
3. **Return the count**:
   - After completing the iteration, return the count of items that match the given rule.
