[Leetcode 1356. Sort Integers by The Number of 1 Bits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1356)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `arr`, you need to sort the integers in the array in ascending order by the number of `1`s in their binary representation and in case of two or more integers have the same number of `1`s you need to sort them in ascending order of their values.

### Example:
1. **Input:** `arr = [0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]`
   - **Output:** `[0,1,2,4,8,3,5,6,7]`
   - **Explanation:**
     - The numbers in binary are:
       - `0  -> 0000`
       - `1  -> 0001`
       - `2  -> 0010`
       - `3  -> 0011`
       - `4  -> 0100`
       - `5  -> 0101`
       - `6  -> 0110`
       - `7  -> 0111`
       - `8  -> 1000`
     - Sorting by the number of `1`s gives us `[0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 3, 5, 6, 7]`.

2. **Input:** `arr = [1024, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1]`
   - **Output:** `[1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024]`
   - **Explanation:** 
     - Binary representation has only one `1` bit for each number.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Should we consider negative numbers or just non-negative integers?
   - **A:** The problem typically involves non-negative integers.

2. **Q:** Are duplicates allowed in the array?
   - **A:** Yes, duplicates are allowed in the input array.

3. **Q:** Should the function be case-sensitive with regards to sorting?
   - **A:** Sorting is based on binary representation `1` bits and then by numeric value in case of ties.

## Strategy

1. **Convert each integer to its binary representation**, count the number of `1` bits.
2. **Sort the array** using a custom comparator:
   - First, by the number of `1` bits.
   - Second, by the numeric value in case of ties.
3. **Return the sorted array**.

Using Java, we will:
- Implement a comparator that counts `1` bits using `Integer.bitCount`.
- Sort the array using `Arrays.sort` with the custom comparator.

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: The time complexity of `Arrays.sort()` is `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
- **Counting bits**: Counting `1` bits using `Integer.bitCount` is `O(1)` since it processes a constant number of bits.

## Java Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int[] sortByBits(int[] arr) {
        // Sorting the array with a custom comparator
        Arrays.sort(arr, (a, b) -> {
            int bitCountA = Integer.bitCount(a);
            int bitCountB = Integer.bitCount(b);

            if (bitCountA == bitCountB) {
                return a - b; // If counts are equal, sort by the numeric value
            } else {
                return bitCountA - bitCountB; // Else sort by the bit count
            }
        });
        return arr;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        
        // Test cases
        int[] arr1 = {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8};
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(sol.sortByBits(arr1))); // [0, 1, 2, 4, 8, 3, 5, 6, 7]

        int[] arr2 = {1024, 512, 256, 128, 64, 32, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1};
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(sol.sortByBits(arr2))); // [1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128, 256, 512, 1024]
    }
}
```
