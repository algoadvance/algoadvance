[Leetcode 943. Find the Shortest Superstring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l943)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of strings `A`, find the shortest string that contains each string in `A` as a substring. We may assume that no string in `A` is a substring of another string in `A`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size:** What are the constraints on the number of strings in `A` and the length of each string in `A`?
   - Assume `1 <= A.length <= 12` and `1 <= A[i].length <= 20`.

2. **Character Set:** Are the strings composed of lowercase English letters only?
   - Yes.

3. **Return Value:** Should the function return any such shortest superstring or all possible shortest superstrings?
   - The function should return any one shortest possible superstring.

### Strategy

We need to construct a string that includes every string in `A` at least once and minimize its length. We can think of this as a variation of the traveling salesman problem (TSP), where the cost is defined as the additional length required to add a new string to our superstring. 

We can use dynamic programming with bitmasks to achieve this. Here's a step-by-step summary:

1. **Calculate Overlaps:**
   - Calculate the maximum overlap between every pair of strings `A[i]` and `A[j]`. This tells us how much of `A[j]` can be appended to `A[i]` after their overlapping parts are factored out.

2. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - Use a bitmask DP array `dp[mask][i]` where `mask` represents a subset of strings and `i` represents the last string added to the superstring.
   - The value of `dp[mask][i]` will store the shortest length of the superstring that can be composed from the subset defined by `mask` and ends with the string `A[i]`.

3. **Reconstruct the Path:**
   - After filling out the DP table, backtrack to reconstruct the shortest superstring by keeping track of the transitions.

Here is the implementation of the above plan in Java:

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public String shortestSuperstring(String[] A) {
        int n = A.length;
        int[][] overlap = new int[n][n];
        
        // Calculate overlap[i][j]
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i != j) {
                    overlap[i][j] = getOverlap(A[i], A[j]);
                }
            }
        }

        // DP table
        int[][] dp = new int[1 << n][n];
        int[][] parent = new int[1 << n][n];

        // Initialize DP and parent tables
        for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
            Arrays.fill(dp[mask], Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2);  // Use a large value to initialize
            Arrays.fill(parent[mask], -1);
        }

        // Seed the dp and parent for single item sets
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[1 << i][i] = A[i].length();
        }

        // DP to fill the table
        for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if ((mask & (1 << i)) == 0) continue;
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                    if (i == j || (mask & (1 << j)) == 0) continue;
                    int newMask = mask ^ (1 << i);
                    int newLength = dp[newMask][j] + overlap[j][i];
                    if (newLength < dp[mask][i]) {
                        dp[mask][i] = newLength;
                        parent[mask][i] = j;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // Get the shortest superstring length
        int mask = (1 << n) - 1;
        int minLen = Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2;
        int last = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (dp[mask][i] < minLen) {
                minLen = dp[mask][i];
                last = i;
            }
        }

        // Reconstruct the path
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        boolean[] seen = new boolean[n];
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        for (int i = last; i != -1; i = parent[mask][i]) {
            stack.push(i);
            mask ^= (1 << i);
        }
        
        int curr = stack.pop();
        sb.append(A[curr]);
        seen[curr] = true;
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            int next = stack.pop();
            sb.append(A[next].substring(overlap[curr][next]));
            seen[next] = true;
            curr = next;
        }
        
        // Append any remaining words (it should not happen but for safety)
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!seen[i]) sb.append(A[i]);
        }

        return sb.toString();
    }

    // Calculate the maximum overlap between suffix of a and prefix of b
    private int getOverlap(String a, String b) {
        int maxOverlap = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= Math.min(a.length(), b.length()); i++) {
            if (a.substring(a.length() - i).equals(b.substring(0, i))) {
                maxOverlap = i;
            }
        }
        return b.length() - maxOverlap;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Overlap Calculation:** Calculating the overlap between every pair of strings takes \(O(n^2 \cdot k)\), where \(n\) is the number of strings and \(k\) is the maximum length of a string.
- **Dynamic Programming:** The DP table has \(O(2^n \cdot n)\) states, and each state transition involves checking \(O(n)\) previous states, giving \(O(2^n \cdot n^2)\) time complexity.
- **Total:** The overall time complexity is \(O(n^2 \cdot k + 2^n \cdot n^2)\), which is feasible given the constraints.
