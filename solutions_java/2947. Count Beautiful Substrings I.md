[Leetcode 2947. Count Beautiful Substrings I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2947)
## Problem Statement

The problem is to count "beautiful substrings" in a given binary string `s` containing only the characters '0' and '1'. A "beautiful substring" is defined as any substring of `s` that starts with '0' and ends with '1'.

### Example

For example, given `s = "011011"`, the beautiful substrings are:
- "01"
- "011"
- "0110"
- "01101"
- "10"
- "101"
- "1101"
- "01"

So the result should be `8`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are overlapping substrings allowed?**
   - Yes, overlapping substrings are allowed.
   
2. **Is there a maximum length for the string `s`?**
   - For the sake of interview scenarios, assume the length can be large, say up to 10^5.

3. **Do we need to consider substrings containing only 0s or only 1s?**
   - No, only substrings starting with '0' and ending with '1'.

## Strategy

1. **Initialize Counters:**
   - Use two integer counters: one for counting '0's and one for counting 'beautiful substrings'.

2. **Traverse the String:**
   - Iterate through each character in the string `s`.
   - If the character is '0', increment the '0' counter.
   - If the character is '1', add the current '0' counter value to the 'beautiful substrings' counter (to account for all substrings ending with this '1' and starting with any '0' encountered before).

3. **Return the Counter:**
   - At the end, the 'beautiful substrings' counter will have the count of all possible beautiful substrings.

This approach ensures a linear time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string, which is efficient given the constraints.

## Code

```java
public class BeautifulSubstrings {
    public int countBeautifulSubstrings(String s) {
        int zeroCount = 0;
        int beautifulCount = 0;
        
        // Traverse through the string
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '0') {
                zeroCount++;
            } else if (c == '1') {
                beautifulCount += zeroCount;
            }
        }
        
        return beautifulCount;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BeautifulSubstrings solution = new BeautifulSubstrings();
        System.out.println(solution.countBeautifulSubstrings("011011")); // Output should be 8
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we traverse the string once, with constant time operations inside the loop. The space complexity is O(1), as we are using only a few extra variables, irrespective of the input size.
