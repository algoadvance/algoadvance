[Leetcode 1763. Longest Nice Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1763)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return the longest substring of `s` that is a "nice" substring. A "nice" substring is a string where, for every letter in that substring, the corresponding uppercase or lowercase letter also exists in the substring. If there are multiple longest "nice" substrings, return the one that appears first. If there are none, return an empty string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Is the input guaranteed to be non-null?
   - What is the maximum length of the input string `s`?

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - If there are multiple substrings of the same maximum length that are "nice", do we need to return the first one encountered?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - How should we handle strings with no "nice" substrings?
   - How should we treat empty strings?

Based on the prompt, I'll assume:
- The input string `s` is non-null.
- When multiple substrings of the same length exist, return the first one.

### Strategy

The solution to this problem can be approached using the following steps:

1. **Substrings Generation:**
   - Generate all possible substrings of `s`.

2. **Check for "Nice" Property:**
   - For each substring, check whether it satisfies the "nice" property.

3. **Track Longest Substring:**
   - Keep track of the longest substring that satisfies the "nice" property.

For checking the "nice" property, we can use a set to record the presence of characters in both their uppercase and lowercase forms. If all characters in a substring have both their uppercase and lowercase counterparts, the substring is considered "nice".

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public String longestNiceSubstring(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        String longestNiceSubstring = "";

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; j++) {
                String substring = s.substring(i, j);
                if (isNice(substring) && substring.length() > longestNiceSubstring.length()) {
                    longestNiceSubstring = substring;
                }
            }
        }

        return longestNiceSubstring;
    }

    private boolean isNice(String str) {
        Set<Character> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (char ch : str.toCharArray()) {
            set.add(ch);
        }
        for (char ch : str.toCharArray()) {
            if (!set.contains(Character.toUpperCase(ch)) || !set.contains(Character.toLowerCase(ch))) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        String s = "YazaAay";
        System.out.println("Longest Nice Substring: " + solution.longestNiceSubstring(s));
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Generating Substrings:** \(O(n^2)\) where \(n\) is the length of the input string, since there are \(\frac{n(n+1)}{2}\) substrings to consider.
- **Checking "Nice" Property:** \(O(n)\) for each substring, where \(n\) is the length of the substring.

Combining these complexities, the overall time complexity is:
- **Total Time Complexity:** \(O(n^3)\) where \(n\) is the length of the input string.

This is because for each of the \( \frac{n(n+1)}{2} \approx O(n^2) \) substrings, we are performing a \(O(n)\) check.
