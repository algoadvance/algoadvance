[Leetcode 2150. Find All Lonely Numbers in the Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2150)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. A number `x` is considered lonely if it appears only once in the array, and no adjacent numbers (i.e., `x+1` and `x-1`) appear in the array.

Return _all lonely numbers in `nums`._ You may return the answer in any order.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [10,6,5,8]
Output: [10,8]
Explanation:
- 10 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 9 and 11 do not appear in the array.
- 8 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 7 and 9 do not appear in the array.
- 5 and 6 are not lonely numbers because they are adjacent to each other.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,5,3]
Output: [1,5]
Explanation:
- 1 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 0 and 2 do not appear in the array.
- 5 is a lonely number since it appears exactly once and 4 and 6 do not appear in the array.
- 3 is not a lonely number because it appears twice.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the input array be empty?**
   - No, according to the problem context, the input array will have at least one integer.
2. **Can the input array have negative numbers?**
   - The problem doesn't specify restrictions on negative numbers, so we assume the array can contain negative integers.
3. **Are we required to return the result in sorted order?**
   - No, the problem statement allows returning the result in any order.

### Strategy
1. **Frequency Count:** We'll use a HashMap to count the frequency of each number in the array.
2. **Loneliness Check:** We'll iterate through the array and check if a number is lonely:
   - It appears exactly once (using the frequency map).
   - Its adjacent numbers (i.e., `x+1` and `x-1`) do not appear in the array (using a HashSet for quick lookup).

### Code
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.Set;

public class LonelyNumbers {
    public List<Integer> findLonely(int[] nums) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();
        Set<Integer> uniqueNums = new HashSet<>();
        
        // Building the frequency map
        for (int num : nums) {
            frequencyMap.put(num, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
            uniqueNums.add(num);
        }
        
        List<Integer> lonelyNumbers = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Finding lonely numbers
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (frequencyMap.get(num) == 1 && !uniqueNums.contains(num - 1) && !uniqueNums.contains(num + 1)) {
                lonelyNumbers.add(num);
            }
        }
        
        return lonelyNumbers;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LonelyNumbers ln = new LonelyNumbers();
        
        int[] nums1 = {10, 6, 5, 8};
        System.out.println(ln.findLonely(nums1)); // Output: [10, 8]
        
        int[] nums2 = {1, 3, 5, 3};
        System.out.println(ln.findLonely(nums2)); // Output: [1, 5]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Building Frequency Map & Unique Set:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
- **Finding Lonely Numbers:** O(n).

Overall, the algorithm runs in **O(n)** time complexity, which is efficient for this problem.

This approach ensures that we check each number's conditions in a linear pass with the help of auxiliary data structures.
