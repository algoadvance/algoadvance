[Leetcode 1742. Maximum Number of Balls in a Box](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1742)
### Problem Statement:

You are working in a ball factory where you have `n` balls numbered from `lowLimit` to `highLimit` inclusive. You want to distribute the balls into `m` boxes. To do this, you can use a hashing function defined as the summation of the digits of the ball number. The box number that a ball goes into is the result of the hashing function modulo `m`.

Find the box that has the maximum number of balls. If there are multiple such boxes, return any of them.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Range of Numbers:**
    - What are the constraints on `lowLimit`, `highLimit`, and `m`?
2. **Function Definition:**
    - Should the hashing function handle negative numbers, or is it guaranteed that ball numbers are positive?

### Strategy:

1. **Digit Sum Function:**
    - Implement a helper function to compute the sum of the digits of a given number.
2. **Distribution and Counting:**
    - Iterate over each number from `lowLimit` to `highLimit`.
    - Use the digit sum function to determine the box number for each ball by calculating `digit_sum % m`.
    - Use a hash map to count the number of balls in each box.
3. **Finding the Maximum:**
    - Traverse the hash map to find the box with the maximum number of balls.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is dominated by the need to process each ball number from `lowLimit` to `highLimit`. Each computation involves summing the digits (which is a logarithmic operation relative to the number).

Letâ€™s assume the average digit sum operation takes constant time: `O(log n) ~ O(1)`, then:
- Overall time complexity is `O(highLimit - lowLimit + 1)`, i.e., linear in the number of balls.

### Implementation in Java:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class MaximumNumberOfBallsInBox {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int lowLimit = 1;
        int highLimit = 10;
        int m = 5;
        
        System.out.println(maximumBallsInBox(lowLimit, highLimit, m));
    }

    public static int maximumBallsInBox(int lowLimit, int highLimit, int m) {
        // Map to store counts of balls in each box
        Map<Integer, Integer> boxCountMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Iterate from lowLimit to highLimit
        for (int i = lowLimit; i <= highLimit; i++) {
            int boxNumber = digitSum(i) % m;
            boxCountMap.put(boxNumber, boxCountMap.getOrDefault(boxNumber, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        // Find the box with maximum balls
        int maxBalls = 0;
        for (int count : boxCountMap.values()) {
            if (count > maxBalls) {
                maxBalls = count;
            }
        }
        
        // If there are multiple such boxes, any will do - return maxBalls
        return maxBalls;
    }

    // Helper method to calculate sum of digits
    private static int digitSum(int num) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            sum += num % 10;
            num /= 10;
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **digitSum Function:** Computes the sum of the digits for the ball number.
- **maximumBallsInBox Method:** Iterates over the ball numbers, computes their box using the digit sum modulo `m`, and maintains a count of balls per box in a hash map.
- Finally, it finds the maximum count of balls in any box and returns it.
