[Leetcode 338. Counting Bits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l338)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, return an array `ans` of length `n + 1` such that for each `i` (0 <= i <= n), `ans[i]` is the number of `1`'s in the binary representation of `i`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,1]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 5
Output: [0,1,1,2,1,2]
Explanation:
0 --> 0
1 --> 1
2 --> 10
3 --> 11
4 --> 100
5 --> 101
```

**Constraints:**
- 0 <= n <= 10^5

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Should we consider the binary representation length or only the count of `1`s?
   **A:** Only the count of `1`s in the binary representation of each integer from 0 to `n`.

2. **Q:** Are there any restrictions on time or space complexity?
   **A:** The solution should be efficient in both time and space, preferably `O(n)` for time complexity and `O(n)` for space complexity.

### Strategy
We can utilize dynamic programming to solve this problem. Let's break down our approach:

1. **Base Case:**
   The number of `1`s for `0` is `0`.

2. **General Case:**
   For any integer `i`, the number of `1`s in `i` can be derived from its half (`i/2`):
   - If `i` is even, `i` has the same number of `1`s as `i/2`.
   - If `i` is odd, `i` has one more `1` than `i/2`.

Thus, we can use the following recurrence relation to populate our `ans` array:
- `ans[i] = ans[i >> 1] + (i & 1)`

   Here, `i >> 1` is equivalent to dividing `i` by 2, and `i & 1` checks if `i` is odd (1) or even (0).

### Code
```java
public class CountingBits {
    public int[] countBits(int n) {
        int[] ans = new int[n + 1];
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            ans[i] = ans[i >> 1] + (i & 1);
        }
        return ans;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CountingBits cb = new CountingBits();
        int[] result1 = cb.countBits(2);
        for (int num : result1) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
        
        int[] result2 = cb.countBits(5);
        for (int num : result2) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time complexity:** `O(n)`. We iterate through each number from `1` to `n` once.
- **Space complexity:** `O(n)`. We use an array of size `n+1` to store the results.

This solution is efficient and leverages the properties of binary numbers to count bits in linear time.
