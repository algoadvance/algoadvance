[Leetcode 238. Product of Array Except Self](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l238)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

The problem must be solved without using division and in O(n) time complexity.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on Array Elements:**
   - What is the range of values that elements in `nums` can take?

   Typically, the elements are within the range of `-30` to `30`, and the length of the array is between `1` to `10^5`.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should be returned if the input `nums` contains only one element?

   Since the problem statement implicitly expects length >= 1, this is not a practical concern for the given constraints.

3. **Handling Zeros in the Array:**
   - How are zeros handled in `nums`?

   The method should correctly handle multiple zeros, ensuring the product result respects those zeros.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Arrays for Left and Right Products:**
   - Use two additional arrays (`leftProducts` and `rightProducts`) to store the cumulative products of all elements to the left and right of each element, respectively.
   
2. **Calculate Left Products:**
   - Traverse the array from left to right to populate `leftProducts`.

3. **Calculate Right Products:**
   - Traverse the array from right to left to populate `rightProducts`.

4. **Compute Result Array:**
   - Combine the `leftProducts` and `rightProducts` to produce the result based on the formula:
     `answer[i] = leftProducts[i] * rightProducts[i]`

By using this approach, we avoid division and ensure the solution adheres to O(n) time complexity because each traversal is linear with respect to the array length.

### Code

Here's the implementation based on the described strategy:

```java
public class ProductOfArrayExceptSelf {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        
        // Prepare arrays to store products of all elements to the left and right of each element
        int[] leftProducts = new int[n];
        int[] rightProducts = new int[n];
        int[] result = new int[n];
        
        // Initialize the first element of leftProducts array and the last element of rightProducts array
        leftProducts[0] = 1;
        rightProducts[n - 1] = 1;
        
        // Fill leftProducts array with cumulative products from the left
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            leftProducts[i] = nums[i - 1] * leftProducts[i - 1];
        }
        
        // Fill rightProducts array with cumulative products from the right
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            rightProducts[i] = nums[i + 1] * rightProducts[i + 1];
        }
        
        // Construct the result array using leftProducts and rightProducts
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            result[i] = leftProducts[i] * rightProducts[i];
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ProductOfArrayExceptSelf solution = new ProductOfArrayExceptSelf();
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        int[] result = solution.productExceptSelf(nums);
        
        for (int val : result) {
            System.out.print(val + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. We traverse the data three times linearly: first to compute `leftProducts`, then `rightProducts`, and finally to build the result array.

- **Space Complexity:** O(n) due to the additional arrays `leftProducts` and `rightProducts` (excluding the input and output arrays).
