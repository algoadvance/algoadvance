[Leetcode 2809. Minimum Time to Make Array Sum At Most x](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2809)
### Problem Statement
**2809. Minimum Time to Make Array Sum At Most**

You are given an array `nums` and an integer `x`.

In one operation, you can choose any element from the array, and perform one of the following manipulations to the element:
- Decrease the element by 1.
- Increase the element by 1.
- Remove the element from the array.

You need to perform a set of operations such that the sum of the array becomes less than or equal to `x` as quickly as possible.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to achieve this goal. If it is not possible, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of values in the array `nums` and the integer `x`?**
   - This helps in understanding if there are any constraints on the values that may affect the solution or edge cases.
   
2. **Is the array empty or can it be zero-length?**
   - To know if we need to handle edge cases involving empty arrays.

3. **Can the values in `nums` be negative?**
   - To determine if special handling for negative numbers is required.

### Code
```java
import java.util.*;

public class MinimumTimeArraySum {
    
    public static int minOperations(int[] nums, int x) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        int sum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            maxHeap.add(num);
            sum += num;
        }
        
        if (sum <= x) {
            return 0; // No operations needed if sum already less than or equal to x
        }
        
        int operations = 0;
        
        while (!maxHeap.isEmpty() && sum > x) {
            int maxElement = maxHeap.poll();
            sum -= maxElement;
            operations++;
        }
        
        return sum <= x ? operations : -1; // If not possible to reduce the sum to x, return -1
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int x = 10;
        System.out.println(minOperations(nums, x)); // Should output the minimum operations
    }
}
```
### Strategy
1. **Initial Sum Calculation**: Compute the initial sum of the array. If it is already less than or equal to `x`, return 0 indicating no operations are needed.
2. **Use a Max Heap**: To efficiently get the highest element to remove (or reduce), use a max heap.
3. **Remove/Reduce the Highest Element**: Continuously remove the highest element from the heap until the sum of the remaining elements is less than or equal to `x`.
4. **Edge Case Handling**: If after removing all elements the sum is still greater than `x`, return `-1` since it is not possible to make the sum less than or equal to `x`.

### Time Complexity
The main operations involve heap insertions and deletions:
- **Building the initial heap**: O(n log n) due to inserting each element.
- **Heap operations while reducing the sum**: Each operation takes O(log n), and in the worst case, we might need n operations.
Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)**. The space complexity is **O(n)** due to the heap.

This should be efficient enough for relatively large arrays given typical constraints in coding problems.
