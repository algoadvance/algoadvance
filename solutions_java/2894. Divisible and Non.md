[Leetcode 2894. Divisible and Non full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2894)
Sure! Let's solve the LeetCode problem step-by-step. Here's a structured approach:

## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. Return the sum of elements that are divisible by `k` minus the sum of elements that are not divisible by `k`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can `nums` contain negative numbers?
   - Yes, the problem statement does not restrict the nature of the integers.
2. What should we return if all numbers are divisible or non-divisible by `k`?
   - Follow the same logic: sum the elements that match the condition and return the difference.

## Strategy

1. Initialize two variables `divisible_sum` and `non_divisible_sum` to zero.
2. Iterate through each element in `nums` and:
   - If the element is divisible by `k`, add it to `divisible_sum`.
   - Otherwise, add it to `non_divisible_sum`.
3. Compute and return the difference: `divisible_sum - non_divisible_sum`.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int getDifference(int[] nums, int k) {
        int divisible_sum = 0;
        int non_divisible_sum = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num % k == 0) {
                divisible_sum += num;
            } else {
                non_divisible_sum += num;
            }
        }
        
        return divisible_sum - non_divisible_sum;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`. The algorithm iterates through each element once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as no additional space proportional to the input size is used, only a fixed amount of extra space.

This approach ensures we efficiently calculate the required difference with optimal time and space usage.
