[Leetcode 476. Number Complement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l476)
### Problem Statement:
Given a positive integer `num`, output its complement number. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation. For instance, the binary complement of the number `5` (`101` in binary) is `2` (`010` in binary).

**Example 1:**
```
Input: num = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is 101 (5 in decimal), and its complement is 010 (2 in decimal).
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: num = 1
Output: 0
Explanation: The binary representation of 1 is 1 (1 in decimal), and its complement is 0 (0 in decimal).
```

**Constraints:**
- The given integer `num` is guaranteed to fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
- `num >= 1`

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Q:** What is the maximum value of the input number?
   - **A:** The maximum value is \(2^{31} - 1\) (the limit for a 32-bit signed integer).
2. **Q:** Are there any special requirements for the output format?
   - **A:** The output should be an integer which is the complement of the given number.
3. **Q:** Do we need to handle negative values?
   - **A:** No, the problem constraints ensure the input will always be a positive integer.

### Strategy:
1. Convert the number to its binary representation.
2. Create a mask which has all bits set to 1 up to the most significant bit in the binary representation of the number.
3. XOR the original number with this mask to flip all bits.

**Detailed Steps:**
1. Calculate the bit length of `num`.
2. Create a mask of the same bit length with all bits set to 1.
3. XOR the number with the mask to get the complement.

### Code:
```java
public class NumberComplement {
    public int findComplement(int num) {
        // Calculate the bit length of num
        int bitLength = (int)(Math.log(num) / Math.log(2)) + 1;
        
        // Create a mask with all 1s of the same bit length as num
        int mask = (1 << bitLength) - 1;
        
        // XOR num with the mask to get the complement
        return num ^ mask;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NumberComplement nc = new NumberComplement();
        
        // Test cases
        System.out.println(nc.findComplement(5)); // Output: 2
        System.out.println(nc.findComplement(1)); // Output: 0
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is \(O(1)\) because the number of operations required does not depend on the input size. The logarithmic operation and bit manipulation are performed in constant time.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is also \(O(1)\), since we are using a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.
