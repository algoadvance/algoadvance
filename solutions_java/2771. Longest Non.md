[Leetcode 2771. Longest Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2771)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, both having length `n`. A *non-decreasing subarray* is a subarray that meets the condition where every `nums[i] <= nums[i + 1]`.

You can choose a subarray from either `nums1` or `nums2` but need to find the maximum length of a non-decreasing subarray that can be taken from both arrays combined.

Write an algorithm to find the maximum length of such subarray.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range:**
   - What is the maximum size of the arrays? (Assume typical constraints like `1 <= n <= 10^5` for competitive programming problems)

2. **Values of Elements:**
   - Can the array elements be negative, or should we assume non-negative numbers?

3. **Combined Subarray Clarification:**
   - Can an optimal subarray switch between `nums1` and `nums2` at the intersection, or do we strictly consider a subarray fully contained within one of the arrays?

### Strategy

1. **Simulation and Two-Pointer Approach:**
   - Use two pointers to iterate over the arrays while maintaining and comparing the lengths of non-decreasing subarrays.
   - For each index, decide whether continuing with the current subarray or starting a new one gives a better result.

2. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - Use dynamic programming to find the lengths of non-decreasing subarrays that can start or end at each index for both arrays.
   - Combine results to derive the longest subarray considering both arrays.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxNonDecreasingLength(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int n = nums1.length;
        int[] dp1 = new int[n];
        int[] dp2 = new int[n];
        
        dp1[0] = 1;
        dp2[0] = 1;
        int maxLen = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dp1[i] = nums1[i] >= nums1[i - 1] ? dp1[i - 1] + 1 : 1;
            dp2[i] = nums2[i] >= nums2[i - 1] ? dp2[i - 1] + 1 : 1;
            
            if (nums1[i] >= nums2[i - 1]) {
                dp1[i] = Math.max(dp1[i], dp2[i - 1] + 1);
            }
            if (nums2[i] >= nums1[i - 1]) {
                dp2[i] = Math.max(dp2[i], dp1[i - 1] + 1);
            }
            
            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, Math.max(dp1[i], dp2[i]));
        }
        
        return maxLen;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
  - We iterate over the arrays once, performing constant-time operations at each step.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`
  - We use two additional arrays `dp1` and `dp2` of length `n`.

This solution efficiently calculates the required maximum length of a non-decreasing subarray by considering transitions between both arrays.
