[Leetcode 1566. Detect Pattern of Length M Repeated K or More Times](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1566)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of positive integers `arr`, find a pattern of length `m` that is repeated at least `k` times. A pattern is a subarray (contiguous subarray) of `arr` that:
- occurs at least `k` times.
- the distance between each occurrence of the pattern is exactly `m`.

Return `true` if there exists such a pattern and `false` otherwise.

### Example 1:

```
Input: arr = [1,2,4,4,4,4], m = 1, k = 3
Output: true
Explanation: The pattern (4) of length 1 is repeated 4 times.
```

### Example 2:

```
Input: arr = [1,2,1,2,1,1,1,3], m = 2, k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: The pattern (1,2) of length 2 is repeated 2 times.
```

### Example 3:

```
Input: arr = [1,2,1,2,1,1,1,3], m = 2, k = 3
Output: false
Explanation: The pattern (1,2) of length 2 is repeated 2 times but not 3 times.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the array have negative or zero values?**
   - No, the array contains only positive integers.
2. **Should the pattern be contiguous in its repetitions, or can there be gaps as long as the distance between repetitions is `m`?**
   - The pattern must be contiguous and every repetition should be exactly `m` distance from each other.
3. **Can `m` or `k` be zero or negative?**
   - No, `m` and `k` are positive integers.

## Strategy

1. **Sliding Window Approach**: We will utilize a sliding window method to check for patterns:
   - Iterate through the array up to the length minus `m` times `k` to avoid out-of-bound errors.
   - Use nested loops to check for patterns of length `m` starting from each index.
   - For each subarray of length `m`, check if it repeats `k` times consecutively.
   
2. **Pattern Matching**:
   - For a given starting index, extract a subarray of length `m`.
   - Check if this subarray is repeated exactly `k` times by comparing the subsequent elements in blocks of size `m`.

## Code

```java
public class DetectPattern {
    public boolean containsPattern(int[] arr, int m, int k) {
        int n = arr.length;
        
        // Iterate through the array up to length minus (m * (k - 1))
        for (int i = 0; i <= n - m * k; i++) {
            boolean matchFound = true;
            // Check the pattern in chunks of size m
            for (int j = 0; j < m * (k - 1); j++) {
                if (arr[i + j] != arr[i + j + m]) {
                    matchFound = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (matchFound) return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DetectPattern dp = new DetectPattern();
        
        // Test cases
        System.out.println(dp.containsPattern(new int[]{1,2,4,4,4,4}, 1, 3)); // true
        System.out.println(dp.containsPattern(new int[]{1,2,1,2,1,1,1,3}, 2, 2)); // true
        System.out.println(dp.containsPattern(new int[]{1,2,1,2,1,1,1,3}, 2, 3)); // false
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m * k)
  - We iterate through the array up to `n - m * k`, checking for patterns. Each pattern check involves comparing up to `m * (k - 1)` elements.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We only use a constant amount of extra space for variables.

By adapting this approach, we ensure an efficient and clear solution to the problem.
