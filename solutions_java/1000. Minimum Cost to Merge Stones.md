[Leetcode 1000. Minimum Cost to Merge Stones full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1000)
Certainly! Let's break this down step by step.

### Problem Statement
You are given an array `stones` of length `n` where `stones[i]` represents the weight of the i-th stone. We need to merge exactly `k` adjacent stones into one pile repeatedly until there is one stone left. The cost of merging k stones is the sum of their weights. Find the minimum cost to merge all the stones into one pile. If it is impossible to merge into one pile, return -1.

**Constraints:**
1. `1 <= stones.length <= 30`
2. `2 <= k <= 30`
3. `1 <= stones[i] <= 100`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Can `k` be greater than the length of the array? 
   **A**: No, because it wouldn't be possible to merge k stones if k is greater than the length.

2. **Q**: Can we have negative weights?
   **A**: No, all weights are positive as given in the constraints.

3. **Q**: What if we can't merge into one pile?
   **A**: If it's not possible to merge all the way down to one pile, we return -1.

### Strategy
1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: 
   We will use a dynamic programming approach where `dp[i][j][m]` will represent the minimum cost to merge the subarray `stones[i...j]` into `m` piles.

2. **Base Case**: 
   If `m = 1`, then we need exactly one big merge that converts `k` piles into 1 pile.

3. **Transition**: 
   If we want to reduce `dp[i][j][m]` to `dp[i][j][1]`, it will depend on merging `m` to 1, which will turn into merging `m` subproblems.

4. **Optimization**: 
   We need to maintain a prefix sum array to help quickly calculate the sum of any subarray.

### Code

```java
public class MinCostToMergeStones {
    public int mergeStones(int[] stones, int K) {
        int n = stones.length;
        
        // Check whether we can merge into one pile
        if ((n - 1) % (K - 1) != 0) return -1;
        
        // 3D DP table
        int[][][] dp = new int[n][n][K + 1];
        
        // Initialize sums array for the subarray sums
        int[] sum = new int[n + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum[i + 1] = sum[i] + stones[i];
        }
        
        // Fill DP table
        for (int len = 1; len <= n; len++) { // length of the subarray
            for (int i = 0; i + len <= n; i++) {
                int j = i + len - 1;
                for (int m = 2; m <= K; m++) {
                    dp[i][j][m] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
                    // Try to split into m piles
                    for (int x = i; x < j; x += K - 1) {
                        dp[i][j][m] = Math.min(dp[i][j][m], dp[i][x][1] + dp[x + 1][j][m - 1]);
                    }
                }
                dp[i][j][1] = (len == 1) ? 0 : dp[i][j][K] + sum[j + 1] - sum[i];
            }
        }
        
        return dp[0][n - 1][1];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
Given the constraints, the time complexity would be:
- Building the prefix sum array: `O(n)`
- Filling up the DP table: `O(n^3 * K)`

This results because for each possible subarray of length `n`, you might be iteratively calculating over potential splits and piles `K`.

### Final Notes
1. This DP approach is standard for merging stone problems as it minimizes redundant calculations.
2. Ensure understanding of why certain conditions like `(n-1) % (K-1) != 0` are checked initially.
3. The use of prefix sum array helps optimize the sum calculation.
