[Leetcode 2225. Find Players With Zero or One Losses](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2225)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of matches where `matches[i] = [winner_i, loser_i]` indicates that the player `winner_i` defeated the player `loser_i` in a match.

Return a list `answer` of size 2 where:
- `answer[0]` is a list of all players who have not lost any matches.
- `answer[1]` is a list of all players who have lost exactly one match.

Each list in `answer` should be sorted in increasing order.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints on input size and values**:
   - What is the maximum size of the `matches` array?
   - What values can the players' identifiers take (e.g., integer range)?
2. **Unique identifiers**:
   - Are the player identifiers unique positive integers?
3. **Output specifications**:
   - Should the lists in the answer be sorted in ascending order?

**Assumption based on common problem constraints**:
- The number of matches is reasonably large (within typical constraints like 10^5).
- Player identifiers are unique positive integers and could be quite large.

### Strategy
1. Use two hash maps:
   - One for counting the number of defeats for each player.
   - One for tracking all players to identify those who havenâ€™t lost.
2. Iterate over the matches:
   - Update the defeat count for the loser in the first hash map.
   - Update the set of players.
3. After processing all matches:
   - Determine which players have zero defeats (not in the defeat count map).
   - Determine which players have exactly one defeat from the defeat count map.
4. Sort both lists and populate the answer array.

### Code
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> findWinners(int[][] matches) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> defeatCount = new HashMap<>();
        Set<Integer> players = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (int[] match : matches) {
            int winner = match[0];
            int loser = match[1];
            
            players.add(winner);
            players.add(loser);
            
            defeatCount.put(loser, defeatCount.getOrDefault(loser, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        List<Integer> noLosses = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Integer> oneLoss = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int player : players) {
            int losses = defeatCount.getOrDefault(player, 0);
            if (losses == 0) {
                noLosses.add(player);
            } else if (losses == 1) {
                oneLoss.add(player);
            }
        }
        
        Collections.sort(noLosses);
        Collections.sort(oneLoss);
        
        List<List<Integer>> answer = new ArrayList<>();
        answer.add(noLosses);
        answer.add(oneLoss);
        
        return answer;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Building the maps and set**: O(N), where N is the number of matches, since each match is processed once.
- **Determining the players with zero or one losses**: O(P), where P is the total number of unique players (typically <= 2N).
- **Sorting the result lists**: O(P log P).

Overall, the time complexity is **O(N + P log P)**, where P <= 2N.

### Space Complexity
- O(N + P) for storing defeat counts and player set, which is linear in terms of the input size and number of unique players.

This approach ensures efficient processing and sorting, providing the required lists of players meeting the specified criteria.
