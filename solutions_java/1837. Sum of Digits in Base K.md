[Leetcode 1837. Sum of Digits in Base K full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1837)
## Problem Statement

**1837. Sum of Digits in Base K**

Given an integer `n` (in base 10) and an integer `k`, return the sum of the digits of `n` after converting `n` from base 10 to base `k`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 34, k = 6
Output: 9
Explanation: 34 (base 10) is 54 in base 6. 5 + 4 = 9.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 10, k = 10
Output: 1
Explanation: 10 (base 10) is 10 in base 10. 1 + 0 = 1.
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `2 <= k <= 10`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What should we do in case of invalid inputs, such as `n < 1` or `k < 2`?
    - **A:** The problem statement guarantees that `1 <= n <= 100` and `2 <= k <= 10`, so we don't need to handle invalid inputs.

2. **Q:** Are there any specific constraints on the output?
    - **A:** The output should always be a non-negative integer, which is the sum of the digits of the given number in the new base `k`.

3. **Q:** Can we assume that the inputs `n` and `k` will always be integers?
    - **A:** Yes, the inputs are guaranteed to be integers within the given constraints.

## Strategy

To solve the problem, follow these steps:

1. **Convert `n` from Base 10 to Base `k`:**
   - Repeatedly divide the number `n` by `k`.
   - Store the remainders of these divisions which will be the digits in base `k`.
   - Build the number in the new base by placing remainders in reverse order.

2. **Sum the Digits:**
   - As you obtain each remainder during conversion, you can directly add it to the sum, avoiding the need to construct the full number in base `k`.

## Code

```java
public class SumOfDigitsInBaseK {
    public int sumBase(int n, int k) {
        int sum = 0;
        
        while (n > 0) {
            sum += n % k;
            n /= k;
        }
        
        return sum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SumOfDigitsInBaseK solver = new SumOfDigitsInBaseK();
        
        // Test cases
        System.out.println(solver.sumBase(34, 6));  // Expected output: 9
        System.out.println(solver.sumBase(10, 10)); // Expected output: 1
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Conversion and Summation Process:**
   - Each division operation decreases the value of `n` by a factor of `k`. The number of operations required is proportional to `(log_k n)`.
   - Each division and modulus operation is O(1).

In summary, the time complexity of this solution is **O(log k n)**, which is efficient given the constraints \(1 \le n \le 100\) and \(2 \le k \le 10\).
