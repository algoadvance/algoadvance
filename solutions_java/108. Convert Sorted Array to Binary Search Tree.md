## Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 108: "Convert Sorted Array to Binary Search Tree"

Given an integer array `nums` where the elements are sorted in ascending order, convert it to a height-balanced binary search tree (BST).

A height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than 1.

Example:
```
Input: nums = [-10, -3, 0, 5, 9]
Output: [0, -3, 9, -10, null, 5]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Can the input array be empty?
   - **A**: Yes, in which case the output should be `null`.
2. **Q**: Should the BST values be returned in any specific format?
   - **A**: As required by the problem, we will return the root node of the BST.

## Strategy

1. **Approach**:
   - Since the input array is sorted in ascending order, we can use a divide-and-conquer strategy.
   - At each step, select the middle element of the current array segment to be the root of the subtree.
   - Recursively apply this to the left and right subarrays to construct the left and right subtrees respectively.

2. **Steps**:
   - Define a helper function `sortedArrayToBST` that takes in the array segment's start and end indices.
   - To get the middle element, calculate `middle = (start + end) / 2`.
   - Create a tree node with the value at this middle index.
   - Recursively construct the left subtree with the segment from `start` to `middle - 1`.
   - Recursively construct the right subtree with the segment from `middle + 1` to `end`.
   - Return the root node.

3. **Base Case**:
   - If `start > end`, return `null` because it means the segment is invalid or all elements have been processed.

## Code

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode sortedArrayToBST(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
            return null;
        }
        return constructBST(nums, 0, nums.length - 1);
    }

    private TreeNode constructBST(int[] nums, int start, int end) {
        if (start > end) {
            return null;
        }

        int mid = start + (end - start) / 2;
        TreeNode node = new TreeNode(nums[mid]);
        node.left = constructBST(nums, start, mid - 1);
        node.right = constructBST(nums, mid + 1, end);

        return node;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - Each element in the array is processed once to create tree nodes.
  - Because the array is divided and processed in a balanced manner, each level of recursion operates on portions of the array that get smaller by approximately half.

- **Space Complexity**: O(log n) for the recursion stack
  - The depth of the recursion is limited to the height of the tree, which is log(n) for a balanced BST with n nodes.
