[Leetcode 2102. Sequentially Ordinal Rank Tracker](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2102)
### Problem Statement

Design a system that gives users the ability to track the ranking of elements based on their values. Specifically, you need to implement a class `SORTracker` with the following methods:

- **`void add(String name, int score)`**: Adds a user's name and score to the system.
- **`String get()`**: Returns the name of the k-th highest score among the elements added so far (where k starts at 1).

By repeatedly calling `get()` consecutively after `add()`, you get the next highest rank element.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can multiple users have the same score?**
   - Yes, and in such a case, they should be ranked lexicographically by name.
   
2. **Should `get()` always return the next highest rank?**
   - Yes, each call to `get()` should return the next highest rank based on the elements added so far.

3. **Can we call `add()` and `get()` in any sequence?**
   - Yes, the methods can be called in any arbitrary order.

4. **What are the constraints on name and score?**
   - Typically constraints might be:
     - Name: 1 ≤ length of name ≤ 10, alphanumeric characters.
     - Score: 1 ≤ score ≤ 10^6.

### Strategy

We need to maintain a dynamic list of elements ordered by their score and name. This suggests using a data structure that supports efficient insertion and retrieval of ordered elements. A balanced binary search tree or a priority queue could be appropriate.

But, to handle efficiently the `get` operation which involves finding the k-th highest rank (or equivalently the k-th lowest if using a max-heap), we need to ensure that we can maintain an ordered sequence and retrieve the k-th element efficiently.

Thus, the implementation approach would benefit from using two balanced heaps:
1. A max-heap to maintain the highest k elements.
2. A min-heap to store the remainder of the elements.

Each time an element is added, we need to ensure the heaps' top elements correctly reflect the k-th highest element.

### Code

Here is an implementation using `PriorityQueue` in Java for the two-heap strategy:

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class SORTracker {
    private PriorityQueue<Element> maxHeap;
    private PriorityQueue<Element> minHeap;
    private int getCount;

    public SORTracker() {
        maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a.compareTo(b));
        minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b.compareTo(a));
        getCount = 0;
    }
    
    public void add(String name, int score) {
        Element newElement = new Element(name, score);
        if (maxHeap.size() < getCount + 1) {
            maxHeap.offer(newElement);
        } else {
            if (newElement.compareTo(maxHeap.peek()) < 0) {
                minHeap.offer(maxHeap.poll());
                maxHeap.offer(newElement);
            } else {
                minHeap.offer(newElement);
            }
        }
    }

    public String get() {
        getCount++;
        minHeap.offer(maxHeap.poll());
        return minHeap.peek().name;
    }

    private static class Element implements Comparable<Element> {
        String name;
        int score;
        
        Element(String name, int score) {
            this.name = name;
            this.score = score;
        }

        @Override
        public int compareTo(Element other) {
            if (this.score != other.score) {
                return Integer.compare(other.score, this.score);
            }
            return this.name.compareTo(other.name);
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **add(String name, int score)**:
  - The `add` operation primarily involves heap operations:
    - Insertion into a heap: O(log k), where k is the size of the larger heap (bounded by the total number of elements added).
  - Overall: O(log k).

- **get()**:
  - The `get` operation involves moving the top of the max-heap to the min-heap.
  - It also requires accessing the top of the min-heap, both of which are O(log k) operations.
  - Overall: O(log k).
