[Leetcode 53. Maximum Subarray](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l53)
## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [-2,1,-3,4,-1,2,1,-5,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [4,-1,2,1] has the largest sum = 6.
```

Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the input array be empty?
   - **A:** No, as per the constraints, the length of the array is at least 1.
   
2. **Q:** Are all elements integers?
   - **A:** Yes, all elements in the array are integers and fall within the range `-10^4` to `10^4`.

3. **Q:** Should we return the subarray itself, or just its sum?
   - **A:** The problem requires only the sum of the maximum subarray.

## Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use **Kadane's Algorithm**. This algorithm is based on dynamic programming and works as follows:
1. Initialize two variables: `max_current` and `max_global`. Set both to the first element of the array.
2. Iterate through the array starting from the second element:
   - Update `max_current` to be the maximum of the current element alone or the sum of `max_current` and the current element.
   - Update `max_global` to be the maximum of `max_global` and `max_current`.
3. After finishing the iteration, `max_global` will contain the largest sum of the contiguous subarray.

## Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxSubArray(int[] nums) {
        int max_current = nums[0];
        int max_global = nums[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            max_current = Math.max(nums[i], max_current + nums[i]);
            if (max_current > max_global) {
                max_global = max_current;
            }
        }
        
        return max_global;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the array. We only need to pass through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`. No additional space besides a few variables.
