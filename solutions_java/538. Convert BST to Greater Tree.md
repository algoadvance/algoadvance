[Leetcode 538. Convert BST to Greater Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l538)
### Problem Statement
Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), convert it to a Greater Tree such that every key of the original BST is changed to the original key plus the sum of all keys greater than the original key in BST.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the input BST always valid?**
   - Yes, you can assume the BST is always valid.
2. **Can the BST contain negative values?**
   - Yes, it can contain negative values.
3. **What should be returned?**
   - The root of the modified BST should be returned.
4. **Can the BST have duplicate values?**
   - No, a valid BST does not contain duplicate values.

### Strategy
To convert the BST to a Greater Tree, we need to ensure that every node's value is updated to the sum of its value plus all nodes with values greater than its own.

**Steps to achieve this:**
1. Perform a reverse in-order traversal (Right -> Node -> Left). This allows us to process nodes in descending order.
2. Maintain a cumulative sum while traversing the tree.
3. For each node, update its value with the cumulative sum and then update the cumulative sum to include the node's original value.

### Code
```java
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    
    TreeNode() {}
    
    TreeNode(int val) { 
        this.val = val; 
    }

    TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

public class Solution {
    private int cumulativeSum = 0;

    public TreeNode convertBST(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return null;
        }
        // Traverse the right subtree
        convertBST(root.right);
        // Process the current node
        cumulativeSum += root.val;
        root.val = cumulativeSum;
        // Traverse the left subtree
        convertBST(root.left);
        return root;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the BST. This is because we are traversing each node exactly once.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(h), where h is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursion stack used for the depth-first search. In the worst case of a highly imbalanced tree (e.g., a straight line), the space complexity could be O(n). For a balanced tree, it would be O(log n).
