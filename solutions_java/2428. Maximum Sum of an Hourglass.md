[Leetcode 2428. Maximum Sum of an Hourglass](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2428)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid`. The maximum sum of an hourglass cannot be obtained directly. An hourglass in the grid is a subset of values with indices making the following pattern:

```
a b c
  d
e f g
```

If there are multiple hourglasses, you need to return the maximum sum of these hourglasses.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the size constraints on the matrix `grid`?**
   - The matrix can be any size, but for an hourglass to exist, `m >= 3` and `n >= 3`.

2. **Can the matrix contain negative values?**
   - Yes, the matrix may contain negative values.

3. **What is the expected input format?**
   - The function will receive a 2D list representing the `grid`.

4. **Are there any specific edge cases to consider?**
   - Edge cases include the minimum matrix size (3x3), matrices with all negative values, or matrices with mixed values.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we'll use the following approach:

1. Iterate through each possible starting point of the hourglass in the grid. 
   An hourglass starting at `(i, j)` must be contained within bounds of the grid, so `0 <= i <= m-3` and `0 <= j <= n-3`.
   
2. For each starting point, compute the sum of the hourglass:
   ```
   sum = grid[i][j]   + grid[i][j+1]   + grid[i][j+2]
                     + grid[i+1][j+1]
         + grid[i+2][j] + grid[i+2][j+1] + grid[i+2][j+2]
   ```
3. Keep track of the maximum sum encountered during the iteration.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxSumOfHourglass(int[][] grid) {
        int maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int rows = grid.length;
        int cols = grid[0].length;
        
        // Loop through potential top-left corners of hourglass
        for (int i = 0; i <= rows - 3; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= cols - 3; j++) {
                int currentSum = calculateHourglassSum(grid, i, j);
                maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);
            }
        }
        
        return maxSum;
    }
    
    private int calculateHourglassSum(int[][] grid, int i, int j) {
        return grid[i][j] + grid[i][j+1] + grid[i][j+2]
                            + grid[i+1][j+1]
               + grid[i+2][j] + grid[i+2][j+1] + grid[i+2][j+2];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. We need to iterate through all possible top-left positions of an hourglass.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, since we're only using a few extra variables regardless of the input size.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum sum of any hourglass in the given grid.
