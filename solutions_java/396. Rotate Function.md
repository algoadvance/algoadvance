[Leetcode 396. Rotate Function](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l396)
### Problem Statement

**LeetCode 396: Rotate Function**

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`.

Assume `F(k)` is a function that calculates the sum of the products of each element in `nums` with their respective indexes after `nums` is rotated `k` times.

The rotation is done in such a manner that:
- When `k = 1`, the last element moves to the first position, and all other elements are shifted to the right.
- When `k = n-1`, the same rightward shift continues.

Define `F(k)` as:

```
F(k) = 0 * nums[k] + 1 * nums[k+1] + ... + (n-1) * nums[k-1]
```

The task is to find out the maximum value after calculating `F(k)` for all `k` in the range `[0, n-1]`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of the input size `n`?
   - What is the range of the elements in the `nums` array?

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Should the function return an integer representing the maximum value of `F(k)`?

### Strategy

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - We need to calculate `F(k)` for all rotations `k` from `0` to `n-1`.
   - Directly computing `F(k)` would involve a lot of repeated calculations, so we need an optimal approach.

2. **Mathematical Insight:**
   - Notice that the transition from `F(k)` to `F(k+1)` can be derived using the relationship between consecutive rotations rather than recalculating from scratch each time.
   - Define `F(0)` as the initial state:
     ```
     F(0) = 0 * nums[0] + 1 * nums[1] + ... + (n-1) * nums[n-1]
     ```
   - For `F(k+1)`, the value can be derived from `F(k)`:
     ```
     F(k+1) = F(k) + sum(nums) - n * nums[n-k]
     ```
   - Where `sum(nums)` is the sum of all elements in `nums`.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - Calculate `sum(nums)` and `F(0)` initially.
   - Iterate from `1` to `n-1` and use the relationship to compute `F(k+1)` from `F(k)`.
   - Track the maximum value during these iterations.

### Code

```java
public class RotateFunction {
    public int maxRotateFunction(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        if (n == 0) return 0;

        int sum = 0;
        int f = 0;

        // Compute sum of all numbers and the initial F(0)
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sum += nums[i];
            f += i * nums[i];
        }

        int max = f;

        // Compute F(k) iteratively and update the maximum found
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            f = f + sum - n * nums[n - i];
            max = Math.max(max, f);
        }

        return max;
    }

    public static void main(String[]args) {
        RotateFunction rf = new RotateFunction();
        int[] nums = {4, 3, 2, 6};
        System.out.println(rf.maxRotateFunction(nums)); // Output: 26
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - We iterate through the array a few times but the operations within each iteration are O(1). Hence, the overall complexity is O(n).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - We use a few extra variables for tracking sums and the current value of `F(k)`, which does not depend on the input size `n`.

This solution efficiently computes the desired maximum value of the rotate function by leveraging the mathematical relationship between consecutive rotations, avoiding redundant calculations.
