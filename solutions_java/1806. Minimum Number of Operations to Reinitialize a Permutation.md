[Leetcode 1806. Minimum Number of Operations to Reinitialize a Permutation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1806)
## Problem Statement
You are given an even integer `n` and you need to create a permutation `perm` of the first `n` positive integers `[0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`. Generate the new array `arr` by using the following rule:
- If `i` is even, then `arr[i] = perm[i / 2]`.
- If `i` is odd, then `arr[i] = perm[n / 2 + (i - 1) / 2]`.

Initially, `perm` is the identity permutation. Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to reinitialize the permutation `perm`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be the output if the permutation is already reinitialized in fewer moves?**
   - We should return the minimum number of operations required, even if the permutation gets back to its original state before `perm` reinitializes completely.
2. **What is the maximum value of `n` that we need to handle?**
   - Typically, the constraints will be manageable within the scope of integer sizes in Java (let's assume `n <= 10^4` for complexity considerations).

## Strategy
1. **Initialization:** Start with the identity permutation `perm = [0, 1, 2, ..., n-1]`.
2. **Transformation:** Create a function to apply the defined transformation rules.
3. **Cycle Detection:** Repeatedly apply the transformation until the permutation returns to its original state, while counting the steps.

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** The algorithm will run in `O(n log n)` due to iterating and checking against the original permutation and reconstructing arrays.
- **Space Complexity:** This approach will use `O(n)` space to store the current permutation array.

## Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MinimumOperationsToReinitializePermutation {
    public int reinitializePermutation(int n) {
        int[] perm = new int[n];
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        
        // Initialize the permutation array as the identity permutation
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            perm[i] = i;
        }
        
        int operations = 0;
        boolean isReinitialized = false;
        
        while (!isReinitialized) {
            // Apply the transformation rule
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (i % 2 == 0) {
                    arr[i] = perm[i / 2];
                } else {
                    arr[i] = perm[n / 2 + (i - 1) / 2];
                }
            }
            
            // Increase the operation count
            operations++;

            // Check if the transformed array is the initial identity permutation
            isReinitialized = Arrays.equals(arr, new int[]{0, 1, 2, ..., n-1});

            // Copy arr back to perm for the next iteration
            perm = Arrays.copyOf(arr, n);
        }
        
        return operations;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumOperationsToReinitializePermutation solver = new MinimumOperationsToReinitializePermutation();
        System.out.println(solver.reinitializePermutation(4));  // Example testcase: Expected output is 2
        System.out.println(solver.reinitializePermutation(6));  // Example testcase: Output should be competently reasoned
    }
}
```

This implementation initializes the permutation array and then repeatedly applies the transformation rules while checking if the permutation has returned to the identity initialization. The main loop continues until the reinitialized state is detected, and the number of operations is counted to deliver the result.
