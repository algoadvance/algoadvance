[Leetcode 2062. Count Vowel Substrings of a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2062)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `word`. A **vowel substring** is a substring of `word` that consists only of vowels (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`) and has all five vowels present at least once.

Your task is to return the number of vowel substrings in the given word.

### Example
1. Input: `word = "aeiouu"`
   Output: `2`
   
2. Input: `word = "unicornarihan"`
   Output: `0`
   
3. Input: `word = "cuaieuouac"`
   Output: `7`

### Constraints
- `1 <= word.length <= 100`
- `word` consists only of lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Should the vowels be contiguous in the substring?**
   - Yes, the vowels should form a contiguous substring.

2. **Is `y` considered a vowel in this context?**
   - No, only `a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u` are considered vowels.

3. **Do we need to count overlapping substrings?**
   - Yes, overlapping substrings should be counted.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach:

1. **Identify Vowel Substrings:** Iterate over the string and use two pointers to identify substrings that contain only vowels.
2. **Check for All Vowels Presence:** For each identified substring, check if it contains all five vowels.
3. **Count Valid Substrings:** Increment the count whenever a valid substring is found.

We will accomplish this in a nested loop to check all substrings and use a set to check the presence of vowels.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int countVowelSubstrings(String word) {
        Set<Character> vowels = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'));
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
            Set<Character> seen = new HashSet<>();
            for (int j = i; j < word.length(); j++) {
                char ch = word.charAt(j);
                if (!vowels.contains(ch)) {
                    break;
                }
                seen.add(ch);
                if (seen.size() == 5) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where `n` is the length of the input string:

- The outer loop runs `n` times, iterating through each character in the string.
- The inner loop, in the worst case, also runs `n` times for each character in the string.

The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a fixed size set to keep track of vowels seen in the current substring.

## Analysis

This algorithm effectively checks each possible substring in a nested manner and ensures that all conditions for a valid vowel substring are met. The constraints (word length up to 100) make the O(n^2) approach feasible.

This concludes the solution to the "Count Vowel Substrings of a String" problem.
