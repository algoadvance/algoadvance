[Leetcode 2929. Distribute Candies Among Children II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2929)
### Problem Statement

You have `n` candies and `k` children. The `i-th` child will get at least `i` candies. After giving these initial candies, if some candies are left then the entire process of distribution will start over according to the same rule. Determine how many candies each of the children gets after distributing all `n` candies.

Given:
- `n` (integer): the total number of candies.
- `k` (integer): the number of children.

Return an array of size `k` where the `i-th` element represents the number of candies that the `i-th` child receives.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the distribution of candies cyclical in a way that we keep distributing candies until none are left?**  
   Yes, the children get candies in rounds. In each round, the first child gets 1 candy, the second child gets 2 candies, and so on until the k-th child gets k candies. If there are remaining candies, the process starts over with the first child.
   
2. **Is it guaranteed that `n` and `k` are positive integers?**  
   Yes, according to the problem constraints.

3. **What should we do if `n` is less than the sum of the initial candies?**  
   If `n` is less than the initial sum required to give at least one candy to each child, distribute as many candies as possible according to the given order.

### Strategy

1. Initialize an array `candies` of size `k` with all zeros to keep track of how many candies each child receives.
2. Start a variable `current_candy` from 1 which represents the number of candies given in the current turn.
3. Use a variable `index` to cycle through the children (`index = index % k`).
4. In each iteration:
   - Check if there are enough candies left to give `current_candy` candies.
   - If not, give the remaining candies.
   - If yes, give `current_candy` candies to the child at `index` and update the child's total.
   - Update the number of remaining candies, increment `current_candy` and `index`.
5. Repeat until there are no more candies left.

### Code

```java
public static int[] distributeCandies(int n, int k) {
    int[] result = new int[k];
    int currentCandy = 1;
    int index = 0;

    while (n > 0) {
        // Determining how many candies to give to current child
        int candiesToGive = Math.min(currentCandy, n);
        result[index] += candiesToGive;
        n -= candiesToGive;

        currentCandy++;
        index = (index + 1) % k; // move to the next child
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the algorithm is `O(sqrt(2n))`.

- Since the sum of the first `m` natural numbers is `m * (m + 1) / 2`, we need to find the point where this sum approaches `n`.
- Thus in the worst case, the number of operations will be proportional to the square root of `2n`, resulting in `O(sqrt(2n))` iterations.

This solution is efficient and works well within typical constraints for the given problem.
