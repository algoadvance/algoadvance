[Leetcode 82. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l82)
### Problem Statement

You are given the head of a sorted linked list. Remove all nodes that have duplicate numbers, leaving only distinct numbers from the original list. Return the linked list sorted as well.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5]
Output: [1,2,5]
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: head = [1,1,1,2,3]
Output: [2,3]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the list guaranteed to be sorted in non-decreasing order?**
   - Yes, the list is sorted.
2. **Do we receive an empty linked list as input?**
   - Yes, the list could be empty, and we should handle it appropriately.
3. **Can the list have all elements as duplicates?**
   - Yes, and in that case, the output should be an empty list.

### Strategy

To solve this problem:
1. We will traverse the linked list while keeping track of the current node and a boolean indicating whether this node is a duplicate.
2. Use a dummy head to easily handle edge cases where the head itself needs to be removed.
3. For each node, we will:
   - Skip over the nodes which are duplicates.
   - If we encounter nodes that are not duplicates, we will include them in our new linked list.
4. Use pointers to omit nodes that are duplicates and move the pointers appropriately.

### Code

Here is the code implementation in Java:

```java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode() {}
    ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
    ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
}

public class Solution {
    public ListNode deleteDuplicates(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null) return null;

        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0, head);
        ListNode pred = dummy;  // predecessor, the last node before the sublist of duplicates

        while (head != null) {
            if (head.next != null && head.val == head.next.val) {
                // Skip nodes whose value are the same as the current node's value
                while (head.next != null && head.val == head.next.val) {
                    head = head.next;
                }
                pred.next = head.next;
            } else {
                pred = pred.next;
            }
            head = head.next;
        }

        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this solution is **O(n)** because:
- We traverse the list only once, processing each node exactly once.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is **O(1)** because:
- We utilize a constant amount of extra space (just a few pointers) regardless of the input size.
