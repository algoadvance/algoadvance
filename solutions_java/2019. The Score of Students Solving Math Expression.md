[Leetcode 2019. The Score of Students Solving Math Expression](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2019)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` that represents a valid arithmetic expression consisting of non-negative integers and the operators `+`, `-`, and `*`, evaluate different possible results by resolving the expression in multiple ways, following the given order of operations and give a score based on a set of results from the students. The `students` array contains the results that each student wrote down, and their total score is the sum of the individual scores of each student’s results:

1. Each correct result from the possible results scores `5` points.
2. Each result that is not correct but can be reached by making a single mistake either in operation order or by using any parenthesis incorrectly scores `2` points.

You need to return the total score.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Can the input string contain spaces or assume it to be space-free?
   - What is the maximum length of the input string?

2. **Possible Errors:**
   - Should we account for cases where students provide results that are neither correct nor reachable by a single mistake?
   - If a student’s result is invalid or out of ordinary scope, what should be its score?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Are there any restrictions on the number of operators or operands?
   - Can the input string be empty or have only one number?

### Strategy

1. **Expression Parsing:**
   - Use dynamic programming to evaluate all possible results of the given expression by inserting parentheses in different ways.
  
2. **DP Table Construction:**
   - Create a 2D DP table where `dp[i][j]` keeps track of all possible results for the sub-expression from index `i` to `j`.

3. **Mistake Calculations:**
   - Determine the results that can be obtained through a single mistake either by changing operation order or adding/removing parentheses.
  
4. **Scoring:**
   - For each result from the `students` array:
     - If the result is in the set of correct results: add 5 points.
     - If the result is a result from a single mistake: add 2 points.
     - Otherwise, add 0 points.

5. **Result Calculation:**
   - Iterate through the `students` array and calculate the total score based on the described scoring strategy.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int scoreOfStudents(String s, int[] students) {
        int n = s.length();
        HashSet<Integer>[][] dp = new HashSet[n][n];
        for (HashSet<Integer>[] row : dp) {
            Arrays.fill(row, new HashSet<>());
        }

        // Evaluate expression using dynamic programming
        for (int len = 1; len <= n; len += 2) {
            for (int i = 0; i + len <= n; i += 2) {
                int j = i + len - 1;
                if (len == 1) { // single number
                    dp[i][j].add(s.charAt(i) - '0');
                } else {
                    for (int k = i + 1; k < j; k += 2) {
                        char op = s.charAt(k);
                        for (int left : dp[i][k - 1]) {
                            for (int right : dp[k + 1][j]) {
                                if (op == '+') {
                                    if (left + right <= 1000) dp[i][j].add(left + right);
                                } else if (op == '-') {
                                    if (left - right <= 1000) dp[i][j].add(left - right);
                                } else if (op == '*') {
                                    if (left * right <= 1000) dp[i][j].add(left * right);
                                }
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        Set<Integer> correctResults = dp[0][n - 1];
        int correctResult = evaluateCorrect(s);

        Set<Integer> mistakeResults = new HashSet<>(correctResults);
        mistakeResults.add(correctResult);

        int score = 0;
        for (int result : students) {
            if (correctResults.contains(result)) {
                score += 5;
            } else if (mistakeResults.contains(result)) {
                score += 2;
            }
        }

        return score;
    }

    private int evaluateCorrect(String s) {
        // Evaluate the expression based on order of operations (multiplication before addition/subtraction).
        Stack<Integer> nums = new Stack<>();
        Stack<Character> ops = new Stack<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {

                while (!ops.isEmpty() && (ops.peek() == '*' || ops.peek() == '+' || ops.peek() == '-')) {

                }

            } else if (c == '*') {

                    compute(nums, ops);
                }
                ops.push(c);
            }
        }
        while (!ops.isEmpty()) {
            compute(nums, ops);
        }

        int b = nums.pop();

        } else if (op == '*') {
            nums.push(a * b);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        String s = "3+2*2";
        int[] students = {7, 8, 11, 6};
        System.out.println(solution.scoreOfStudents(s, students)); // expected output: 12
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of evaluating all possible expressions using the aforementioned dynamic programming approach is \(O(N^3)\) where \(N\) is the length of the expression string.
  
- Evaluating the main expression using the order of operations is \(O(N)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by the dynamic programming approach, making it \(O(N^3)\).
