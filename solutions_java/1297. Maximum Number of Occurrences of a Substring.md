[Leetcode 1297. Maximum Number of Occurrences of a Substring full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1297)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return the maximum number of occurrences of any substring under the following constraints:
- The substring size must be between `minSize` and `maxSize` inclusive.
- The number of unique characters in the substring must be less than or equal to `maxLetters`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Size Constraints**:
    - What is the range of the string length `s`?
    - Can `minSize` be greater than `maxSize`?
   
2. **Character Constraints**:
    - Are there any constraints on the type of characters in `s` (e.g., only lowercase English letters)?

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - What should be returned if no substrings satisfy all constraints?

Assumptions (based on typical problem constraints):
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= minSize <= maxSize <= 26` (assuming `maxSize` is manageable)
- `1 <= maxLetters <= 26`
- String `s` contains only lowercase English letters

### Strategy

To efficiently solve the problem, we will:
1. Focus on substrings of length exactly `minSize`, since longer substrings (up to `maxSize`) will usually be less likely to occur frequently.
2. Use a sliding window approach to generate all substrings of `minSize` length.
3. Use a hash map to count occurrences of these substrings.
4. Use a set to keep track of unique characters in each substring.
5. Maintain a running maximum of valid substring counts.

### Time Complexity

- The sliding window approach ensures we process each substring in constant time, making the computation scales linearly with the length of `s`.
  
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.HashSet;

public class MaximumNumberOfOccurrences {
    public int maxFreq(String s, int maxLetters, int minSize, int maxSize) {
        HashMap<String, Integer> substringCount = new HashMap<>();
        int maxOccurrences = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i <= s.length() - minSize; i++) {
            String substring = s.substring(i, i + minSize);
            HashSet<Character> uniqueCharacters = new HashSet<>();
            for (char c : substring.toCharArray()) {
                uniqueCharacters.add(c);
            }

            if (uniqueCharacters.size() <= maxLetters) {
                substringCount.put(substring, substringCount.getOrDefault(substring, 0) + 1);
                maxOccurrences = Math.max(maxOccurrences, substringCount.get(substring));
            }
        }

        return maxOccurrences;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximumNumberOfOccurrences solution = new MaximumNumberOfOccurrences();
        System.out.println(solution.maxFreq("aababcaab", 2, 3, 4)); // Output: 2
        System.out.println(solution.maxFreq("aaaa", 1, 3, 3)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Sliding Window**:
    - `for (int i = 0; i <= s.length() - minSize; i++)`: Iterate over every possible substring of length `minSize`.
    - `String substring = s.substring(i, i + minSize)`: Extract the substring of length `minSize`.
   
2. **Unique Character Counting**:
    - Use a `HashSet` to count unique characters in the substring.

3. **Constraint Check**:
    - If the number of unique characters in the substring is less than or equal to `maxLetters`, update the occurrence count in the hash map and track the maximum occurrences found.

This ensures that the algorithm efficiently finds the answer with an optimal time complexity relative to the constraints.
