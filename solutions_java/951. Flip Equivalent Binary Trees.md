### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 951: Flip Equivalent Binary Trees

For a binary tree `root1` and `root2`, we would like to check if they are flip equivalent. Two binary trees are considered flip equivalent if and only if they are the same can be obtained from each other by a series of flip operations. In a flip operation, you can swap the left and right children of a node.

Below is an example, where two binary trees are flip equivalent:

```
Example:

Input:
    root1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6,null,null,null,7,8]
    root2 = [1,3,2,null,6,4,5,null,null,null,null,8,7]

Output: true
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Tree Structure**: How are the trees provided, as nodes or array representation?
    * The trees will be given as tree nodes, likely using a TreeNode structure.
2. **Tree Values**: Can we assume the values in the nodes will be unique?
    * Yes, values can be assumed to be unique since each node has a distinct identifier.
3. **Input Constraints**: What are the constraints on the size and structure of the binary tree?
    * Constraints depend on typical binary tree problems, but we should consider trees up to a reasonable depth and size due to recursion limits.

### Strategy

1. **Base Cases**:
    * If both `root1` and `root2` are null, then they are flip equivalent.
    * If one is null and the other is not, then they are not flip equivalent.
    * If the values of `root1` and `root2` are different, then they are not flip equivalent.

2. **Recursive Cases**:
    * Recursively check if the left subtree of `root1` is flip equivalent to the left subtree of `root2` and the right subtree of `root1` is flip equivalent to the right subtree of `root2`.
    * Or, recursively check if the left subtree of `root1` is flip equivalent to the right subtree of `root2` and the right subtree of `root1` is flip equivalent to the left subtree of `root2`.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Objects;

public class FlipEquivalentBinaryTrees {
    public boolean flipEquiv(TreeNode root1, TreeNode root2) {
        if (root1 == null && root2 == null) {
            return true;
        }
        if (root1 == null || root2 == null) {
            return false;
        }
        if (root1.val != root2.val) {
            return false;
        }
        return (flipEquiv(root1.left, root2.left) && flipEquiv(root1.right, root2.right)) ||
               (flipEquiv(root1.left, root2.right) && flipEquiv(root1.right, root2.left));
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we may need to visit each node once to determine if the trees are flip equivalent. We compare subtrees recursively, and each comparison involves a constant amount of work (checking the values and recursive calls).

### Explanation:
- **Base Cases**: Handles null nodes and value mismatches.
- **Recursive Cases**: Two primary checks, the first comparing subtrees as they are and the second comparing them flipped.
