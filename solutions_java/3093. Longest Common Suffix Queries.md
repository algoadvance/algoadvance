[Leetcode 3093. Longest Common Suffix Queries](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3093)
### Problem Statement

You are given two arrays of strings, `words1` and `words2`. For each string `words2[j]`, determine the length of the longest common suffix it shares with any string `words1[i]`.

A suffix of a string is a substring that occurs at the end of the string. The function should return an array of integers where the `j-th` element is the length of the longest common suffix between `words2[j]` and any string in `words1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the strings in the arrays?
   - How many strings can each array contain?

2. **Expected Output:**
   - Should the function handle cases where there are no common suffixes?
   - What should be returned if either array is empty?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Are the strings case-sensitive?
   - Can the arrays contain empty strings?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, you can use a brute force approach that checks each string in `words2` against each string in `words1` to determine the longest common suffix. However, the brute force approach has a high time complexity, which can be optimized by using string matching techniques or data structures like a Trie.

#### Steps:
1. **Initialization**: Create a result array to store the lengths of the longest common suffixes for each string in `words2`.
2. **Nested Loop Comparison**:
    - For each string in `words2`, compare it with each string in `words1`.
    - Use a helper function to find the length of the longest common suffix between two strings.
3. **Store Results**: For each string in `words2`, store the maximum suffix length found with any string in `words1`.

### Code

Here's a Java implementation of the above strategy:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class LongestCommonSuffix {
    public static int[] longestCommonSuffixLength(String[] words1, String[] words2) {
        int[] result = new int[words2.length];
        
        for (int j = 0; j < words2.length; j++) {
            int maxSuffixLength = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < words1.length; i++) {
                int suffixLength = findCommonSuffixLength(words1[i], words2[j]);
                if (suffixLength > maxSuffixLength) {
                    maxSuffixLength = suffixLength;
                }
            }
            result[j] = maxSuffixLength;
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    private static int findCommonSuffixLength(String s1, String s2) {
        int i = s1.length() - 1;
        int j = s2.length() - 1;
        int count = 0;
        
        while (i >= 0 && j >= 0 && s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(j)) {
            count++;
            i--;
            j--;
        }
        
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] words1 = {"test", "hello", "world"};
        String[] words2 = {"fest", "yello", "dworld"};
        
        int[] result = longestCommonSuffixLength(words1, words2);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(result));  // Output: [3, 1, 4]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization**: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of `words2`.
- **Nested Loop Comparison**: `O(n * m * k)` where `n` is the length of `words2`, `m` is the length of `words1`, and `k` is the maximum length of the strings involved.
- **Overall Time Complexity**: `O(n * m * k)`.

This approach ensures that you accurately find the longest common suffix for each string in `words2` by comparing it with all strings in `words1`. If you have further questions or need optimizations, feel free to ask!
