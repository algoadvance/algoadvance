[Leetcode 1751. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1751)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of `events` where `events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi, valuei]`. The `i-th` event starts at `startDayi` and ends at `endDayi`, and if you attend this event, you will receive a value of `valuei`. You are also given an integer `k` which represents the maximum number of events you can attend.

You can only attend one event at any time but can attend non-overlapping events. The goal is to find the maximum sum of values that you can obtain by attending at most `k` non-overlapping events.

Return *the maximum sum of values that you can obtain by attending events.*

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Range and Constraints:**
   - `1 <= k <= events.length <= 10^5`
   - `1 <= startDayi <= endDayi <= 10^9`
   - `1 <= valuei <= 10^6`

2. **Can the events be on the same day?**
   - Yes, an event can start and end on the same day.

3. **Are the events sorted in any way?**
   - Events are not necessarily sorted; we might need to sort them based on their ending times for an optimal solution.

### Strategy
1. **Sort Events by End Day:** Sorting events by their end day ensures that while iterating through events, we always consider earlier finishing events first, which provides a way to select non-overlapping events efficiently.

2. **Utilize Dynamic Programming with Binary Search:**
   - Use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum value achievable by attending `j` events considering the first `i` events.
   - Maintain an auxiliary array to record the maximum value up to the current event.
   - Use binary search to find the most recent event that does not overlap with the current event.

3. **Update DP Arrays:** Iterate through the list of events to update the DP arrays, leveraging precomputed results and binary search for efficiency.

4. **Optimization:** Given `O(n * k * log(n))` complexity, ensure efficient lookups with binary search and minimize redundant computations by memoizing intermediate results.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int maxValue(int[][] events, int k) {
        // Sort the events based on the end time
        Arrays.sort(events, (a, b) -> a[1] - b[1]);
        
        int n = events.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n+1][k+1];
        
        // Initialize dp array
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            Arrays.fill(dp[i], 0);
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            int prev = findNonOverlappingEvent(events, i-1);
            for (int j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
                // if not attending the i-th event
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j];
                // if attending the i-th event
                if (prev != -1) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[prev+1][j-1] + events[i-1][2]);
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], events[i-1][2]);
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[n][k];
    }
    
    private int findNonOverlappingEvent(int[][] events, int index) {
        int left = 0, right = index - 1;
        int target = events[index][0];
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (events[mid][1] < target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return right;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[][] events = // use example above
        int k = 2;
        System.out.println(solution.maxValue(events, k)); // Output: 7
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting:** `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of events.
- **DP Computation:** `O(n * k * log n)` because for each DP state update, a binary search (`O(log n)`) is performed.
- **Total Time Complexity:** `O(n k log n)`, which is efficient given the constraint `n <= 10^5`.
