[Leetcode 1770. Maximum Score from Performing Multiplication Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1770)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays `nums` and `multipliers` of size `n` and `m` respectively, where `n >= m`. The arrays are 1-indexed.

You begin with a score of 0. You want to maximize your score after performing exactly `m` operations. For the i-th operation (1-indexed), you will:

1. Choose one integer `nums[x]` from **either** the start or the end of the `nums` array.
2. Add `multipliers[i] * nums[x]` to your score.
3. Remove `nums[x]` from the array.

Return the maximum score after performing `m` operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is it allowed to choose elements from the middle of the array `nums`?**
   No, you can only choose from the start or the end of the array.

2. **Does the order of multipliers matter?**
   Yes, for each step `i`, you must use `multipliers[i]`.

3. **Can multipliers have negative values?**
   Yes, multipliers can have both positive and negative values.

### Strategy

To efficiently maximize the score, we can use Dynamic Programming (DP). We'll use a 2D DP table to keep track of the maximum scores we can achieve by selecting elements from either end of `nums`.

1. **Define DP State**: Let `dp[i][left]` be the maximum score we can get by performing `i` operations where `left` elements have been taken from the start.
2. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - When choosing from the start: `dp[i][left] = dp[i-1][left-1] + nums[left-1] * multipliers[i-1]`
   - When choosing from the end: `dp[i][left] = dp[i-1][left] + nums[n-(i-left)] * multipliers[i-1]`
3. **Initialization**: `dp[0][0] = 0` because no operations have been performed.
4. **Goal**: Maximize the value in `dp[m][*]`, where `*` ranges from `0` to `m`.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maximumScore(int[] nums, int[] multipliers) {
        int n = nums.length, m = multipliers.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][m + 1];

        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int left = 0; left <= i; left++) {
                int mult = multipliers[i - 1];
                if (left > 0) {
                    dp[i][left] = dp[i-1][left-1] + mult * nums[left-1];
                }
                if (i-left > 0) {
                    dp[i][left] = Math.max(dp[i][left], dp[i-1][left] + mult * nums[n-(i-left)]);
                }
            }
        }

        int maxScore = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int left = 0; left <= m; left++) {
            maxScore = Math.max(maxScore, dp[m][left]);
        }

        return maxScore;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Space Complexity**: The DP table requires `O(m^2)` space as we need a 2D array of size `[m+1][m+1]`.
- **Time Complexity**: Filling the DP table takes `O(m^2)`. Each cell access and update involves simple arithmetic operations.

This solution efficiently computes the maximum score by leveraging dynamic programming to explore all possible scenarios of selecting elements from the start or end of the `nums` array and determining the best possible cumulative score.
