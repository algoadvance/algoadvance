[Leetcode 1260. Shift 2D Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1260)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D `grid` of size `m x n` and an integer `k`. You need to shift the `grid` `k` times. In one shift operation:

1. Element at `grid[i][j]` moves to `grid[i][j+1]`.
2. Element at `grid[i][n-1]` moves to `grid[i+1][0]`.
3. Element at `grid[m-1][n-1]` moves to `grid[0][0]`.

Return the `2D grid` after applying the shift operation `k` times.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], k = 1
Output: [[9,1,2],[3,4,5],[6,7,8]]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. What are the constraints on the values of `m`, `n`, and `k`?
2. Will the `grid` always be non-empty?
3. If `k` is greater than the total number of elements in the `grid`, should we take `k % (m*n)`?

## Strategy

The strategy to solve this problem involves flattening the 2D grid into a 1D array, performing the shift on this 1D array, and then converting the 1D array back into the 2D grid.

Steps:

1. Calculate the total number of elements in the grid (`total = m * n`).
2. Normalize the number of shifts: `k = k % total` (since shifting by `total` times results in the same grid).
3. Flatten the grid into a 1D array.
4. Perform the shift on the 1D array.
5. Convert the 1D array back to a 2D grid.

## Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Shift2DGrid {
    public List<List<Integer>> shiftGrid(int[][] grid, int k) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        int total = m * n;
        
        // Normalize the number of shifts
        k = k % total;
        
        // Flatten the grid into a 1D array
        int[] flattened = new int[total];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                flattened[i * n + j] = grid[i][j];
            }
        }
        
        // Create a new flattened array shifted by k positions
        int[] shifted = new int[total];
        for (int i = 0; i < total; i++) {
            shifted[(i + k) % total] = flattened[i];
        }

        // Unflatten the array back into a 2D grid
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            List<Integer> row = new ArrayList<>();
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                row.add(shifted[i * n + j]);
            }
            result.add(row);
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Flattening the grid into a 1D array:** O(m * n)
- **Shifting the elements in the 1D array:** O(m * n)
- **Unflattening the array back into the 2D grid:** O(m * n)

Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(m * n)**.
