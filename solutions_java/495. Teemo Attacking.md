[Leetcode 495. Teemo Attacking](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l495)
### Problem Statement
In the game, Teemo is attacking an enemy Ashe with poison attacks. When Teemo attacks Ashe, Ashe gets poisoned for a certain duration of time. If Teemo attacks again before the poison effect ends, the poison duration will be extended by the time of the new attack, not by adding the new attack's poison time to the remaining poison time.

You are given a non-decreasing array `timeSeries` where `timeSeries[i]` denotes the time at which Teemo attacks Ashe, and an integer `duration` which denotes the duration of the poison effect. Your task is to return the total time that Ashe is poisoned.

### Example
1. Input: `timeSeries = [1, 4]`, `duration = 2`
   Output: `4`
   
2. Input: `timeSeries = [1, 2]`, `duration = 2`
   Output: `3`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `timeSeries` be empty?**
   - Yes, if `timeSeries` is empty, the output should be `0` since no attack means no poison.
   
2. **Is the `timeSeries` guaranteed to be sorted?**
   - Yes, it is guaranteed to be a non-decreasing array.

3. **Can `duration` be zero or negative?**
   - For the purpose of this problem, `duration` will be a positive integer.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int findPoisonedDuration(int[] timeSeries, int duration) {
        if (timeSeries.length == 0) return 0;

        int totalDuration = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < timeSeries.length - 1; i++) {
            totalDuration += Math.min(timeSeries[i + 1] - timeSeries[i], duration);
        }

        // Add the duration for the last attack
        totalDuration += duration;

        return totalDuration;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        
        int[] timeSeries1 = {1, 4};
        int duration1 = 2;
        System.out.println(solution.findPoisonedDuration(timeSeries1, duration1));  // Output: 4

        int[] timeSeries2 = {1, 2};
        int duration2 = 2;
        System.out.println(solution.findPoisonedDuration(timeSeries2, duration2));  // Output: 3
    }
}
```

### Strategy
1. **Initialize `totalDuration`:** Start by initializing `totalDuration` to `0`.
2. **Iterate through the `timeSeries` array:** 
   - For each attack, determine the duration of poisoning by comparing the difference between the current attack and the next attack with `duration`.
   - Use `Math.min(timeSeries[i + 1] - timeSeries[i], duration)` to get the actual contaminated time due to overlapping attacks.
3. **Add the duration of the last attack:** Once loop terminates, append the `duration` caused by the last attack.
4. **Return the calculated `totalDuration`.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the `timeSeries` because we are looping through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` since we are using a constant amount of space for the variable `totalDuration`.

This ensures the solution is both time and space efficient, making it suitable for large inputs as well.
