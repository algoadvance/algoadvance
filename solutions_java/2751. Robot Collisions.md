[Leetcode 2751. Robot Collisions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2751)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `directions` representing the directions in which robots are moving. Specifically, `directions[i]` will be "L" if the i-th robot is moving left, and "R" if the i-th robot is moving right. Robots moving in `L` direction can collide with robots moving in `R` direction if they meet at the same position.

You need to determine after all possible collisions and the robots have stopped moving, which robots remain.

The `robots` array may contain values representing their initial positions. Assume robots move at constant speeds.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the robots moving at the same speed?**
   - Yes, assume all robots move at the same speed.

2. **How do we handle multiple collisions?**
   - Robots colliding in opposing directions cancel each other out (disappear).

3. **Do robots stop after colliding?**
   - Yes, robots stop and disappear on collision.

### Strategy

1. Traverse robot positions to detect collisions.
2. Use a stack to keep track of active robots and manage collisions:
   - Push right-moving robots onto the stack.
   - Whenever a left-moving robot is encountered, check for possible collision:
     - If stack top is a right-moving robot and their positions allow collision, pop the stack (both robots disappear).
     - Continue until no collision is possible or stack is empty.
3. Robots remaining in the stack or to the left of a left-moving robot are survivors.

### Code

Here's how you can implement this logic in Java:

```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class RobotCollisions {

    public static String remainingRobots(String directions) {
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<Character>();
        
        for (char dir : directions.toCharArray()) {
            if (dir == 'R') {
                stack.push(dir);
            } else { // dir == 'L'
                boolean collision = false;
                
                // Process collisions
                while (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() == 'R') {
                    stack.pop();  // collision
                    collision = true;
                }
                
                if (!collision) {
                    stack.push(dir); // No collision so left-moving remains
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Remaining robots after all collisions
        StringBuilder remaining = new StringBuilder();
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            remaining.insert(0, stack.pop());
        }
        
        return remaining.toString();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String directions = "RLRLR";
        System.out.println("Remaining Robots: " + remainingRobots(directions));  // Example test case
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of the input string `directions`.
  - The algorithm processes each character once.
  - Stack operations (push, pop) are O(1).

### Explanation

- The function `remainingRobots` takes the `directions` string as input.
- It uses a stack to track robots moving to the right (R).
- When a left-moving robot (L) is encountered, it processes potential collisions with the robots in the stack.
- The stack retains only the surviving robots.
- The resultant remaining directions (robots) are then returned as a string.

This algorithm efficiently simulates the collision process and determines the robots that remain after all possible collisions.
