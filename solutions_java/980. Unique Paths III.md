[Leetcode 980. Unique Paths III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l980)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` integer array `grid` where `grid[i][j]` could be:

- `1`: The starting square. There is exactly one starting square.
- `2`: The ending square. There is exactly one ending square.
- `0`: Empty squares we can walk over.
- `-1`: Obstacles that we cannot walk over.

Return the number of 4-directional walks from the starting square to the ending square, that walk over every non-obstacle square exactly once.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Grid Dimensions**: What is the maximum size of the grid (m, n)?
   - The problem typically specifies grid sizes to be within manageable limits but confirming the ranges would aid in determining the complexity.
2. **Multiple Paths Handling**: Can there be multiple solutions or paths?
   - Yes, but the problem asks for the count of all unique paths that satisfy the criteria.
3. **Edge Cases**: Can the grid contain only one cell?
   - Usually, grids are at least a couple of cells, but handling degenerate cases or minimum bounds would be good to clarify.

## Strategy

1. **DFS Traversal**: Utilize Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore all possible paths from the start to the end.
2. **Tracking Visited Cells**: Maintain a visited grid or use in-place modification to mark cells as visited to avoid re-visiting.
3. **Ending Condition**: Ensure that the path includes all non-obstacle cells when a path terminates at the ending square (`2`).
4. **Backtracking**: Utilize backtracking to explore all possible paths by resetting the visited state once a path exploration is complete.

## Time Complexity

Let `m` be the number of rows and `n` be the number of columns in the grid:
- **Time Complexity**: The worst-case complexity is `O(4^(m*n))` since in the worst case, each cell has up to 4 recursive calls, with each call further branching into 4.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(m*n)` due to the recursion stack in the worst case when all cells are part of the path.

## Code

```java
public class UniquePathsIII {
    private int result = 0;
    private int rows, cols, emptyCells = 1; // start included in empty cells

    public int uniquePathsIII(int[][] grid) {
        rows = grid.length;
        cols = grid[0].length;
        int startX = 0, startY = 0;
        
        // Initialize and count empty cells
        for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
                if (grid[r][c] == 1) {
                    startX = r;
                    startY = c;
                } else if (grid[r][c] == 0) {
                    emptyCells++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        backtrack(grid, startX, startY, 0);
        return result;
    }

    private void backtrack(int[][] grid, int x, int y, int count) {
        // Boundary check or obstacle
        if (x < 0 || x >= rows || y < 0 || y >= cols || grid[x][y] == -1) {
            return;
        }
        
        // Reach the end
        if (grid[x][y] == 2) {
            if (count == emptyCells) {
                result++;
            }
            return;
        }

        // Mark as visited
        int temp = grid[x][y];
        grid[x][y] = -1;

        // Move in the 4 possible directions
        backtrack(grid, x + 1, y, count + 1);
        backtrack(grid, x - 1, y, count + 1);
        backtrack(grid, x, y + 1, count + 1);
        backtrack(grid, x, y - 1, count + 1);

        // Backtrack and unmark this cell
        grid[x][y] = temp;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        UniquePathsIII solution = new UniquePathsIII();
        int[][] grid = {
            {1, 0, 0, 0},
            {0, 0, 0, 0},
            {0, 0, 2, -1}
        };
        System.out.println(solution.uniquePathsIII(grid));  // Output: 2
    }
}
```

This code defines a method to calculate the number of unique paths from the start to the end while walking over every non-obstacle cell exactly once. The `backtrack` function is recursively called to explore all possible paths.
