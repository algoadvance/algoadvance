[Leetcode 1797. Design Authentication Manager](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1797)
## Problem Statement

Design a token-based authentication manager that can handle user login sessions. The manager should be able to:
1. Generate a new token for each session.
2. Renew existing tokens before they expire.
3. Require tokens for certain operations.
4. Automatically remove expired tokens.

The `AuthenticationManager` class should be implemented with the following methods:

### Methods to Implement

1. `AuthenticationManager(int timeToLive)`: Initializes the object with `timeToLive` set to `timeToLive` seconds.
2. `void generate(string tokenId, int currentTime)`: Generates a new token with the given `tokenId` at the given `currentTime`.
3. `void renew(string tokenId, int currentTime)`: Renews the given token's expiration time if it's still valid at the given `currentTime`.
4. `int countUnexpiredTokens(int currentTime)`: Returns the count of tokens that are still valid at the given `currentTime`.

### Constraints
- `1 <= timeToLive <= 10^8`
- `1 <= currentTime <= 10^8`
- 1 <= tokenId.length <= 5
- `tokenId` consists of only lowercase letters.
- All `generate`, `renew`, countUnexpiredTokens methods are called with strictly increasing values of `currentTime`.

## Clarifying Questions

Before implementing the solution, let's clarify a few points:
1. Will `renew` be called with an invalid tokenId (one that was never created or already expired)? If so, what's the expected behavior?
2. Should `generate` create a token if `tokenId` is already present?
3. Can there be concurrent operations, which would necessitate synchronization?

## Strategy

1. **Data Structure**: Use a `HashMap` to store tokens with their expiration times. This allows O(1) access and update.
2. **Generate**: When generating a token, store the token id and its expiration time in the map.
3. **Renew**: Update the expiration time if the token exists and is valid.
4. **Count Unexpired Tokens**: Iterate over the tokens and count the ones which are still valid.

## Code

Here is the Java code for the `AuthenticationManager`:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Iterator;
import java.util.Map;

class AuthenticationManager {
    private final int timeToLive;
    private final Map<String, Integer> tokenMap;

    public AuthenticationManager(int timeToLive) {
        this.timeToLive = timeToLive;
        this.tokenMap = new HashMap<>();
    }

    public void generate(String tokenId, int currentTime) {
        int expirationTime = currentTime + timeToLive;
        tokenMap.put(tokenId, expirationTime);
    }

    public void renew(String tokenId, int currentTime) {
        if (tokenMap.containsKey(tokenId)) {
            int expirationTime = tokenMap.get(tokenId);
            if (expirationTime > currentTime) {
                tokenMap.put(tokenId, currentTime + timeToLive);
            }
        }
    }

    public int countUnexpiredTokens(int currentTime) {
        int count = 0;
        Iterator<Map.Entry<String, Integer>> iterator = tokenMap.entrySet().iterator();
        while (iterator.hasNext()) {
            Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry = iterator.next();
            if (entry.getValue() > currentTime) {
                count++;
            } else {
                // Remove expired tokens to save space
                iterator.remove();
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

Let's analyze the complexity of each operation:
1. **Generate Operation**: O(1) because inserting into the map is an O(1) operation.
2. **Renew Operation**: O(1) because it involves a lookup and an update in the map, both O(1) operations.
3. **Count Unexpired Tokens**: O(n), where n is the number of tokens, because we need to traverse and potentially clean up expired tokens.

This design ensures that the most frequent operations (generate and renew) are efficient, while the count operation, though linear, manages cleanup efficiently.
