[Leetcode 1249. Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1249)
**Problem Statement:**
Given a string `s` of `'('`, `')'`, and lowercase English characters, your task is to remove the minimum number of parentheses (either `'('` or `')'`, in any positions) so that the resulting parentheses string is valid and return any valid string.

A string is considered valid if:
1. It is the empty string, contains only lowercase characters, or
2. It can be written as `AB` (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or
3. It can be written as `(A)`, where A is a valid string.

The problem can be found at: [1249. Minimum Remove to Make Valid Parentheses](https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-remove-to-make-valid-parentheses/)

**Clarifying Questions:**
1. Can I assume that the input string `s` will always contain only lowercase English letters and parentheses?
   - Yes.
2. Should the function return the result in the same order as the input string?
   - Yes, the result should maintain the original order of characters in the input string.

**Strategy:**
1. Traverse the string to identify misplaced parentheses.
   - Use a stack to track indices of `'('` that might need to be removed if they don't find a matching `')'`.
   - During the traversal, when encountering a `')'`, check if there is a matching `'('` in the stack. If there isnâ€™t, mark this `')'` for removal.
2. After the traversal, any indices left in the stack will correspond to unmatched `'('` that should be removed.
3. Construct a new string excluding the characters at the marked indices.

**Code:** 

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public String minRemoveToMakeValid(String s) {
        // Convert the given string to character array for mutability
        char[] sArray = s.toCharArray();
        // Stack to keep track of indices of '('
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        // Set to keep track of indices that need to be removed
        Set<Integer> toRemove = new HashSet<>();

        // First pass to identify misplaced parentheses
        for (int i = 0; i < sArray.length; i++) {
            if (sArray[i] == '(') {
                stack.push(i); // Add index of '(' to the stack
            } else if (sArray[i] == ')') {
                if (!stack.isEmpty()) {
                    stack.pop(); // Matched parenthesis, pop from stack
                } else {
                    toRemove.add(i); // Unmatched ')', add to removal set
                }
            }
        }

        // Add remaining '(' indices in the stack to the removal set
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            toRemove.add(stack.pop());
        }

        // Construct the resulting string excluding indices in the removal set
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < sArray.length; i++) {
            if (!toRemove.contains(i)) {
                result.append(sArray[i]);
            }
        }

        return result.toString();
    }
}
```

**Time Complexity:**
- The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because:
  1. We traverse the string once to identify misplaced parentheses.
  2. We traverse the string again to construct the result string.
- Space complexity is O(n) due to:
  - The stack used to keep track of `'('` positions.
  - The set used to store indices of characters to be removed.
  - The result string builder.
