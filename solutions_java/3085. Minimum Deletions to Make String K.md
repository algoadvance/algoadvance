[Leetcode 3085. Minimum Deletions to Make String K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3085)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, a string is K-special if every character appears exactly `k` times. Your task is to return the minimum number of deletions required to make the string `K-special`. If it is not possible, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the length of `s` and value of `k`?**
   - This impacts the efficiency of the algorithm we will employ.

2. **Can the string `s` contain any character from the ASCII set, or is it limited to lowercase, uppercase, etc.?**
   - It could affect how we handle the frequency count of characters.

3. **Should we consider an empty string as K-special?**
   - This helps in understanding edge cases.

4. **Can `k` be zero?**
   - This would impact how we handle certain edge cases.

### Strategy

1. **Count Frequency of Characters:** We will first count the frequency of each character in the string `s`.
2. **Compute Required Deletions:** Using the frequency count, compute the number of deletions needed for each character to appear exactly `k` times.
3. **Check Feasibility:** If any characterâ€™s frequency is less than `k` and non-zero, making the string K-special is impossible.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    public int minDeletionsToMakeKSpecial(String s, int k) {
        if (k == 0) {
            return -1;
        }

        Map<Character, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            frequencyMap.put(c, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }

        int deletionsNeeded = 0;
        for (int freq : frequencyMap.values()) {
            if (freq < k) {
                return -1;
            }
            deletionsNeeded += (freq - k);
        }

        return deletionsNeeded;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        
        // Example Tests
        System.out.println(solution.minDeletionsToMakeKSpecial("aabbcc", 2)); // Expected Output: 0
        System.out.println(solution.minDeletionsToMakeKSpecial("aabbc", 2));  // Expected Output: -1
        System.out.println(solution.minDeletionsToMakeKSpecial("aaabb", 2)); // Expected Output: 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Building Frequency Map:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`, as we traverse the entire string.
- **Computing Deletions:** O(m), where `m` is the number of unique characters in the string (which is at most 26 for lowercase English letters).

The overall time complexity is O(n), as `m` is bounded by a constant (26 for lowercase letters). This ensures our solution is efficient even for the maximum possible length of `s`.

### Conclusion

This approach ensures that we effectively compute the minimum deletions needed to transform the given string into a K-special string, or correctly identify when it is impossible to do so. Make sure to validate the constraints and handle edge cases according to given constraints or problem definition.
