[Leetcode 2467. Most Profitable Path in a Tree full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2467)
### Problem Statement

You are given a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph with no cycles) rooted at node 0 containing `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n-1`. Each node has a value associated with it representing profit/loss. We need to find the maximum sum path from the root (node `0`) to any leaf node. A leaf node is defined as a node with exactly one edge.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the values associated with nodes allowed to be negative?**
   - Yes, the values can be negative, but the goal is to maximize the sum.
   
2. **Should we consider paths that start and end at node `0`?**
   - No, we need to find a path from node `0` to any leaf node.

3. **Is the tree always connected and contains no cycles?**
   - Yes, the problem guarantees that it is a tree.

4. **What should be returned if there are no nodes in the tree?**
   - The problem definition implies there is at least one node (node `0`).

### Strategy

1. **DFS Traversal:**
   - Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) starting from the root node (node `0`).
   - Keep track of the current path sum during the traversal.

2. **Identify Leaf Nodes:**
   - Leaf nodes have only one connection (i.e., they are not the root and their degree is 1).
   - If during traversal a leaf node is reached, compare the path sum to the current maximum sum.

3. **Update Maximum Sum:**
   - Keep updating the maximum sum whenever a leaf node is reached with a higher path sum than the previously recorded maximum.

### Code

Here is the Java code implementing the above strategy:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class MostProfitablePath {
    
    private static int maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
    
    public static int mostProfitablePath(int n, int[][] edges, int[] values) {
        List<List<Integer>> tree = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            tree.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            tree.get(u).add(v);
            tree.get(v).add(u);
        }
        
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        dfs(tree, values, 0, 0, visited);
        return maxSum;
    }
    
    private static void dfs(List<List<Integer>> tree, int[] values, int node, int currentSum, boolean[] visited) {
        visited[node] = true;
        currentSum += values[node];
        boolean isLeaf = true;
        
        for (int neighbor : tree.get(node)) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                isLeaf = false;
                dfs(tree, values, neighbor, currentSum, visited);
            }
        }
        
        if (isLeaf && node != 0) {
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);
        }
        
        visited[node] = false; // Backtrack
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 6;
        int[][] edges = {{0, 1}, {0, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 5}};
        int[] values = {0, -2, 3, 1, 10, -1};
        
        System.out.println(mostProfitablePath(n, edges, values)); // Output should be 11
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **DFS Traversal Complexity:**
   - Each node and edge is visited exactly once in the DFS.
   - Time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes.

2. **Space Complexity:**
   - The recursion stack for DFS can go as deep as the height of the tree, which in worst cases is \(O(n)\).
   - The adjacency list representation of tree also takes \(O(n)\) space.
   - Overall space complexity is \(O(n)\).

This solution effectively handles the problem by leveraging depth-first traversal and keeping track of cumulative path sums to identify the maximum profit path from the root node to any leaf node.
