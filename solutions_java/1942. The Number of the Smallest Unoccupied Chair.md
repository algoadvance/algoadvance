[Leetcode 1942. The Number of the Smallest Unoccupied Chair full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1942)
### Problem Statement

We are given an array `times` where `times[i] = [start[i], end[i]]` indicates the arrival and departure times of the ith friend. All the friends arrive and leave at different times. 

There is also an integer `targetFriend` and exactly one chair is assigned to each friend. We want to find the smallest numbered chair that the `targetFriend` will sit in. Chairs are numbered starting from 0. 

Friends arrive and occupy the smallest available chair and leave, making the chair available for others. The objective is to return the chair number that the `targetFriend` will sit in.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Will the input array `times` always be sorted based on the arrival times?**
   - No, the input array `times` can be unordered.
   
2. **What is the range of the input values and sizes?**
   - You can assume reasonable limits such as 1 <= `times.length` <= 1000 and 0 <= `start[i], end[i]` <= 10^9.
   
3. **Is there a possibility of concurrent arrivals?**
   - No, since arrivals and departures are distinct as per the problem statement.

### Strategy

To solve this problem:

1. **Sort the times**: Sort events by their arrival times, if equal by departure times.
2. **Utilize priority queues**:
   - A min-heap to track when chairs are freed up by storing (end time, chair number).
   - Another min-heap to manage the smallest number of chairs that are available.

3. **Process each friend**: Assign the smallest available chair to each arriving friend and free up the chair when the friend leaves.

4. **Track the targetFriend**: Each time the target friend arrives, note the chair assigned and return it.

### Code

Here's the Java code to accomplish the task:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class SmallestUnoccupiedChair {
    public int smallestChair(int[][] times, int targetFriend) {
        int targetArrival = times[targetFriend][0];
        
        // Generate events (start, +1) and (end, -1) for on arrival and departure.
        List<int[]> events = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < times.length; i++) {
            events.add(new int[] { times[i][0], 1, i }); // arrival
            events.add(new int[] { times[i][1], 0, i }); // departure
        }
        
        // Sort events by time, then by type (-1 for departure first)
        Collections.sort(events, (a, b) -> a[0] != b[0] ? a[0] - b[0] : a[1] - b[1]);
        
        PriorityQueue<Integer> availableChairs = new PriorityQueue<>();
        PriorityQueue<int[]> occupiedChairs = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[0]));
        
        // Initialize all chair indices (from 0 to n-1) into the availableChairs heap
        for (int i = 0; i < times.length; i++) {
            availableChairs.add(i);
        }
        
        for (int[] event : events) {
            int time = event[0];
            int type = event[1];
            int friendIndex = event[2];

            // Release chairs that are freed up by checked the earliest used chairs
            while (!occupiedChairs.isEmpty() && occupiedChairs.peek()[0] <= time) {
                availableChairs.add(occupiedChairs.poll()[1]);
            }
            
            if (type == 1) { // Arrival
                int assignedChair = availableChairs.poll();
                occupiedChairs.add(new int[] { times[friendIndex][1], assignedChair });
                if (friendIndex == targetFriend) {
                    return assignedChair;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return -1; // This line should never be reached.
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is primarily driven by the sorting step, which is \(O(N \log N)\), where \(N\) is the number of friends (or events, which is \(2N\)). The operations on the priority queues typically add up to \(O(N \log N)\) as well. Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(N \log N)\).

The space complexity is \(O(N)\) to store the events and the priority queues.
