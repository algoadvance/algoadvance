[Leetcode 1551. Minimum Operations to Make Array Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1551)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer `n`. You have an array `arr` of length `n`, where `arr[i] = 2 * i + 1` for all valid values of `i` (i.e., 0 <= i < n).

In one operation, you can select two different indices `i` and `j` and increase `arr[i]` by 1 and decrease `arr[j]` by 1. The goal is to make all the elements of the array equal. Return the minimum number of operations needed to make all the elements of the array equal.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: arr = [1, 3, 5]
The target common value is 3.
- Operation 1: i=0, j=2 -> arr = [2, 3, 4]
- Operation 2: i=0, j=2 -> arr = [3, 3, 3]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 6
Output: 9
Explanation: arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11]
The target common value is 6.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Does the input `n` have any constraints?
   **A:** Yes, typically for such problems `n` would range between 1 and 10^4.
2. **Q:** Are negative values for `n` possible?
   **A:** No, `n` will always be a positive integer.
3. **Q:** Do we need to return specific operations or just the number of operations?
   **A:** Just the number of operations.

## Strategy
1. **Array Initialization:**
   - The array `arr` will be of length `n` with elements following the pattern `arr[i] = 2 * i + 1`.

2. **Target Value Calculation:**
   - The target value to which all elements should be equal is the median value of the array since this minimizes the sum of absolute deviations.
   - For an odd-length `n`, the median is the middle element.
   - For an even-length `n`, the median could be either of the two middle elements (they are same due to array properties) which simplifies to the middle value in formula `(left + right) // 2`.

3. **Operations Calculation:**
   - The array is symmetric around its median.
   - For each pair `(arr[i], arr[n-1-i])`, calculate the difference between `arr[i]` and target value or `arr[n-1-i]` and target, subtract either from target to equalize.

## Pseudocode
1. Identify the target value (median).
2. Sum the differences from the target for all elements.
3. Return the total sum divided by two to get the minimum operations count.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity to compute the operations is O(n).

## Code
```java
public class MinimumOperationsArrayEqual {
    public int minOperations(int n) {
        int target = n; // Since the array arr[i] = 2*i + 1, its median is n if count is odd or even.
        int operations = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; ++i) {
            int left = 2 * i + 1;
            int right = 2 * (n - 1 - i) + 1;
            operations += target - left; // Focus on left side moving towards the middle value.
        }
        return operations;
    }
}
```

This code ensures minimal operations to make the array elements equal by focusing on the value pattern and exploiting the symmetry of the array around its median.
