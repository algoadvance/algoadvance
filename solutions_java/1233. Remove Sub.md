[Leetcode 1233. Remove Sub](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1233)
## Problem Statement

Given a list of folders `folder`, return the folders after removing all sub-folders in those folders. You may return the answer in any order.

If a folder `/a` is a sub-folder of a folder `/a/b`, it is guaranteed that `/a/b` will be in the list but not `/a`.

### Example 1
```plaintext
Input: folder = ["/a","/a/b","/c/d","/c/d/e","/c/f"]
Output: ["/a","/c/d","/c/f"]
Explanation: Folders "/a/b" and "/c/d/e" are sub-folders of "/a" and "/c/d" respectively.
```

### Example 2
```plaintext
Input: folder = ["/a","/a/b/c","/a/b/d"]
Output: ["/a"]
Explanation: Folders "/a/b/c" and "/a/b/d" will be removed because they are sub-folders of "/a".
```

### Constraints
- `1 <= folder.length <= 4 * 10^4`
- `2 <= folder[i].length <= 100`
- `folder[i]` contains only lowercase letters and '/'.
- `folder[i]` always starts with '/'.
- Each folder name is unique.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the folders list be empty?**
   - No, based on the constraints, there will always be at least one folder.

2. **Is the result order important?**
   - No, the problem statement mentions that the folders can be returned in any order.

3. **How to handle if there are no sub-folders?**
   - If there are no sub-folders, return the original list.

## Strategy

1. **Sort the list**: First, we'll sort the given list of folders. Sorting helps as it ensures that when we iterate, any sub-folder will directly follow its parent folder in the list.
2. **Iterate and compare**: Iterate through the sorted list and compare each folder to the last folder added to the result. If the current folder isn't a sub-folder of the last added folder, add it to the result.
3. **Sub-folder criteria**: A folder `/a/b` is considered a sub-folder of `/a` if it starts with `/a/`.

## Code

Here's the implementation of the above strategy in Java:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class RemoveSubFolders {
    
    public List<String> removeSubfolders(String[] folder) {
        // Sort the folders array
        Arrays.sort(folder);
        
        // Resultant list
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Add the first folder to the result directly
        result.add(folder[0]);
        
        // Iterate over the sorted folders
        for (int i = 1; i < folder.length; i++) {
            String lastAdded = result.get(result.size() - 1);
            
            // Check if the current folder is not a sub-folder of the last added folder
            if (!folder[i].startsWith(lastAdded + "/")) {
                result.add(folder[i]);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RemoveSubFolders solution = new RemoveSubFolders();
        String[] folder1 = {"/a","/a/b","/c/d","/c/d/e","/c/f"};
        System.out.println(solution.removeSubfolders(folder1)); // Output: ["/a", "/c/d", "/c/f"]

        String[] folder2 = {"/a","/a/b/c","/a/b/d"};
        System.out.println(solution.removeSubfolders(folder2)); // Output: ["/a"]
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: The dominant operation here is sorting the folders array, which has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of folders.
- **Iteration**: The iteration through the folders array runs in \(O(n)\).

So, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

This approach ensures that we efficiently remove sub-folders while maintaining clarity and simplicity in the implementation.
