[Leetcode 2528. Maximize the Minimum Powered City](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2528)
### Problem Statement

You're tasked with solving a coding challenge where you need to maximize the minimum power supply in a list of cities given a certain number of power plants and a constraint on the distance they can affect. Specifically, for a list of cities with their initial power supplies, you need to determine the maximum of the minimum power supply each city can have after placing a given number of additional power plants. Each power plant can increase the power of nearby cities within a specified range.

### Problem Description

1. **Input:**
   - An integer array `power` representing the initial power supplies of cities.
   - An integer `k` representing the number of new power plants you can place.
   - An integer `r` representing the range within which each power plant can augment power.

2. **Output:**
   - Return an integer representing the maximum possible minimum power supply across all cities after placing the `k` additional power plants optimally.

### Clarifying Questions

Before diving into the solution, here are some questions to clarify the problem requirements:
1. Can the same city accumulate power from multiple power plants?
2. How should overlapping ranges from different power plants be handled?
3. Are there constraints on the values of city power, `k`, and `r`?
4. Is the power increment fixed or variable and can it be added cumulatively?

Understanding these details will ensure the developed algorithm meets all edge cases and scenarios expected in the problem.

### Strategy

1. **Binary Search on Result:**
   - Given that we need to maximize the minimum power, a binary search on the answer is feasible. This involves checking a mid-value to see if it can be achieved, and adjusting the search range based on whether the current mid-value is achievable.

2. **Sliding Window for Power Distribution:**
   - Within the binary search, a sliding window or a prefix sum array can help efficiently determine if a certain minimum power can be maintained across all cities after placing `k` power plants.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maximizeMinPower(int[] power, int k, int r) {
        int low = 0, high = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        while (low < high) {
            int mid = (low + high + 1) / 2;
            if (canAchieveMid(power, k, r, mid)) {
                low = mid;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        return low;
    }

    private boolean canAchieveMid(int[] power, int k, int r, int mid) {
        int alterations = 0;
        int[] effect = new int[power.length]; // to track additional power units

        for (int i = 0; i < power.length; i++) {
            if (power[i] + effect[i] < mid) {
                int needed = mid - (power[i] + effect[i]);
                alterations += needed;
                if (alterations > k) return false;

                int left = i, right = Math.min(i + 2 * r, power.length - 1);
                if (right + 1 < power.length) effect[right + 1] -= needed;
                effect[left] += needed;
            }
            if (i < power.length - 1) effect[i + 1] += effect[i];
        }

        return alterations <= k;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search:** The number of iterations is `O(log(maxPower))`, where `maxPower` is the maximum value possible for power (bounded by constraints).
- **canAchieveMid Function:** Each iteration involves a linear scan of the `power` array and updates that take linear time. Thus, this is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of cities.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n log(maxPower))`, making it efficient for larger inputs within typical competitive programming constraints.

By following this strategy, the code ensures the optimal placement of additional power plants to maximize the minimum power among all cities efficiently.
