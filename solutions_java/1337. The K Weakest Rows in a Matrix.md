[Leetcode 1337. The K Weakest Rows in a Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1337)
### Problem Statement:

Given a `m x n` binary matrix `mat` of `1`'s (representing soldiers) and `0`'s (representing civilians), return the indexes of the `k` weakest rows in the matrix ordered from the weakest to the strongest.

A row `i` is weaker than row `j` if the number of soldiers in row `i` is less than the number of soldiers in row `j`, or they have the same number of soldiers but `i` is less than `j`. Soldiers are always standing in front of civilians, that is, all the `1`'s will appear to the left of all the `0`'s in each row.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Validity**: 
   - What if `k` is greater than the number of rows? 
   - Should we assume all rows have at least one `0`'s to ensure a mixture of soldiers and civilians?

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Should the output be a list of integers indicating the indices of the rows?

### Strategy:

1. **Count Soldiers in Each Row**:
   - Iterate through each row to count the number of `1`s. Since soldiers (`1`s) always appear before civilians (`0`s), we can use binary search to find the first `0` for efficiency.

2. **Store and Sort**:
   - Store the count along with the row index.
   - Sort these pairs first by the count of soldiers and then by the row index.

3. **Select Top K**:
   - Extract the indices of the top `k` weakest rows from the sorted list.

### Code:

Here is the implementation of the strategy in Java:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public int[] kWeakestRows(int[][] mat, int k) {
        List<int[]> soldiersCount = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Step 1: Count the number of soldiers in each row and pair with the row index
        for (int i = 0; i < mat.length; i++) {
            int soldiers = countSoldiers(mat[i]);
            soldiersCount.add(new int[]{soldiers, i});
        }
        
        // Step 2: Sort the list by the number of soldiers, then by row index
        Collections.sort(soldiersCount, (a, b) -> {
            if (a[0] != b[0]) {
                return a[0] - b[0]; // Compare by number of soldiers
            } else {
                return a[1] - b[1]; // Compare by row index
            }
        });
        
        // Step 3: Extract the indices of the k weakest rows
        int[] weakestRows = new int[k];
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            weakestRows[i] = soldiersCount.get(i)[1];
        }
        
        return weakestRows;
    }
    
    // Helper method to count soldiers using binary search
    private int countSoldiers(int[] row) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = row.length;
        
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (row[mid] == 1) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        
        return left;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

1. **Counting Soldiers**: `O(m * log(n))` - counting soldiers in each of the `m` rows using binary search (`log(n)`).
2. **Sorting Rows**: `O(m * log(m))` - sorting the `m` rows based on soldier count and row indices.

Thus, the overall time complexity is:
\[ O(m \log n + m \log m) \]

This approach ensures that the matrix is processed efficiently and the weakest rows are identified correctly.
