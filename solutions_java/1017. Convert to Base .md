[Leetcode 1017. Convert to Base ](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1017)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, return a string representing its representation in base `-2`.

The function signature:
```java
public String baseNeg2(int n)
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `n` be negative?**
   - No, `n` is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.
   
2. **What is the expected behavior of the function if `n` is zero?**
   - The function should return "0".

3. **How large can `n` be?**
   - The problem doesn't explicitly state the upper limit, but typical constraints for problems of this nature mean `n` can be quite large (e.g., up to `2^31 - 1`).

### Strategy

To convert a number `n` to its base `-2` representation:
1. **Initialize a result string builder** to construct the base `-2` representation.
2. **Iterate while `n` is not zero:**
    - Calculate the remainder `r` when `n` is modulo `-2`.
    - If the remainder is negative, adjust the quotient and the remainder to ensure both are positive.
    - Append the adjusted remainder to the result string.
    - Update `n` to its quotient when divided by `-2`.
3. Reverse the constructed result string to get the final base `-2` representation.
4. Handle the special case where `n` is zero by directly returning "0".

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public String baseNeg2(int n) {
        if (n == 0) {
            return "0";
        }
        
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        
        while (n != 0) {
            int remainder = n % -2;
            n = n / -2;
            
            // Adjust remainder and quotient if remainder is negative
            if (remainder < 0) {
                remainder += 2;
                n += 1;
            }
            
            result.append(remainder);
        }
        
        return result.reverse().toString();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.baseNeg2(2)); // Expected output: "110"
        System.out.println(solution.baseNeg2(3)); // Expected output: "111"
        System.out.println(solution.baseNeg2(4)); // Expected output: "100"
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The conversion process depends on the number of digits in the base `-2` representation of `n`. Each iteration effectively reduces `n` by a factor of `-2` (or increases when adjusted), so the loop runs in `O(log |n|)` iterations.
- **Space Complexity:** The space required is proportional to the number of digits in the base `-2` representation, which is also `O(log |n|)` for the string builder. 

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(log |n|)` and the space complexity is `O(log |n|)`.
