[Leetcode 1386. Cinema Seat Allocation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1386)
## Problem Statement

There is a cinema with `n` rows of seats. Each row has 10 seats labeled from 1 to 10. Given an array `reservedSeats` representing the seats that are already reserved, find the maximum number of families that can be seated together. A family consists of 4 people, and the seating arrangements for a family are:
- Seats 2, 3, 4, 5 (block A)
- Seats 4, 5, 6, 7 (block B)
- Seats 6, 7, 8, 9 (block C)
A family cannot occupy any seat that is already reserved.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format:**
    - `n`: An integer representing the number of rows.
    - `reservedSeats`: A 2D list where each element is a list of two integers representing a reserved seat in the format `[row, seatNumber]`.

2. **Output Format:**
    - An integer representing the maximum number of families that can be seated together.

3. **Constraints:**
    - 1 <= `n` <= 10^9
    - 1 <= `reservedSeats.length` <= min(10*n, 10^4)
    - `reservedSeats[i].length == 2`
    - 1 <= `reservedSeats[i][0] <= n`
    - 1 <= `reservedSeats[i][1] <= 10`
    - All `reservedSeats[i]` are distinct.

Let's now proceed with the strategy.

## Strategy

1. **Data Structure**:
   - Use a HashMap to store the reserved seats for each row. The keys will be the row numbers and the values will be sets of seat numbers that are reserved.
   
2. **Iterate Over Reserved Seats**:
   - Populate the HashMap with the reserved seats.

3. **Count Maximum Families**:
   - For each row, initialize the count of families to 2 (as a row can have a maximum of 2 families if no seats are reserved).
   - Check for each block (A, B, C) defined whether they are free of reserved seats.
   - Adjust the count based on the reserved seats in each row.
   
4. **Calculate Total**:
   - The total number of families is the sum of families in each row.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class CinemaSeatAllocation {
    public int maxNumberOfFamilies(int n, int[][] reservedSeats) {
        Map<Integer, Set<Integer>> reservedMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Populate reserved seats in the map
        for (int[] seat : reservedSeats) {
            reservedMap.putIfAbsent(seat[0], new HashSet<>());
            reservedMap.get(seat[0]).add(seat[1]);
        }
        
        int maxFamilies = 0;
        
        // Calculate for each row in reserved seats
        for (Set<Integer> seats : reservedMap.values()) {
            boolean blockA = !seats.contains(2) && !seats.contains(3) && !seats.contains(4) && !seats.contains(5);
            boolean blockB = !seats.contains(4) && !seats.contains(5) && !seats.contains(6) && !seats.contains(7);
            boolean blockC = !seats.contains(6) && !seats.contains(7) && !seats.contains(8) && !seats.contains(9);
            
            if (blockA && blockC) {
                maxFamilies += 2; // Both blocks can be used
            } else if (blockA || blockB || blockC) {
                maxFamilies += 1; // One of the block can be used
            }
        }
        
        // Add the rows which are not in reservedSeats map, they can accommodate 2 families each
        maxFamilies += 2 * (n - reservedMap.size());
        
        return maxFamilies;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CinemaSeatAllocation solution = new CinemaSeatAllocation();
        int n = 3;
        int[][] reservedSeats = // use example from above
        System.out.println(solution.maxNumberOfFamilies(n, reservedSeats)); // output should be 4
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Map Population**: \(O(R)\), where \(R\) is the length of `reservedSeats`.
- **Row Processing**: \(O(R) \cdot O(1)\) considering the fixed size constraints of rows up to 10 seats.
- Calculating total families take a constant amount of work for each row.
- Overall complexity: \(O(R)\), where \(R\) is the number of reserved seats, which is optimal given the constraints.

This efficiently calculates the maximum number of families that can be seated without any reserved seat conflicts.
