[Leetcode 809. Expressive Words](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l809)
### Problem Statement

We are given a string `S` and a list of strings `words`. We want to determine how many words in the list can be considered "stretchy." A word is stretchy if it can be made to match `S` by adding some number of the same character to every group of consecutive characters in `S`.

Formally, we can achieve a stretchy word by extending each group of consecutive characters of a word `W` such that each group `W_i` can be extended to match group `S_i` in `S`, under the conditions:
1. If the length of `S_i` is 3 or more, we can extend `W_i` to any length equal to or larger than the length of `S_i`.
2. If the length of `S_i` is exactly 2, `W_i` has to match `S_i` exactly (i.e., `len(W_i) == len(S_i)`).
3. If the length of `S_i` is exactly 1.

Return the number of words in `words` that are stretchy.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Limits**: 
   - Is the length of `S` and words in `words` constrained in any way?
   - Are all strings guaranteed to be non-empty and consist of only lowercase English letters?
   
2. **Output**:
   - Should the result be an integer representing the number of stretchy words?

### Strategy

1. **Identify Groups**:
   - Define a helper function `split_to_groups` to split any string into groups of consecutive characters along with their counts.

2. **Check Stretchy Compatibility**:
   - Define a helper function `is_stretchy` to compare the groups from `S` with groups from a word in `words` using the given stretching rules.

3. **Main Function**:
   - Iterate over each word in `words`, split `S` and the current word into groups, check if the word is stretchy using the `is_stretchy` function and count the number of stretchy words.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class ExpressiveWords {

    public static int expressiveWords(String S, String[] words) {
        int count = 0;
        
        List<Group> sGroups = split_to_groups(S);
        
        for (String word : words) {
            List<Group> wGroups = split_to_groups(word);
            if (is_stretchy(sGroups, wGroups)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }

    private static List<Group> split_to_groups(String str) {
        List<Group> groups = new ArrayList<>();
        int i = 0;
        int len = str.length();
        
        while (i < len) {
            char c = str.charAt(i);
            int start = i;
            while (i < len && str.charAt(i) == c) {
                i++;
            }
            groups.add(new Group(c, i - start));
        }
        return groups;
    }

    private static boolean is_stretchy(List<Group> sGroups, List<Group> wGroups) {
        int sLen = sGroups.size();
        int wLen = wGroups.size();
        
        if (sLen != wLen) return false;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < sLen; i++) {
            Group sGroup = sGroups.get(i);
            Group wGroup = wGroups.get(i);
            
            if (sGroup.character != wGroup.character) return false;
            if (sGroup.count < wGroup.count) return false;
            if (sGroup.count > wGroup.count && sGroup.count < 3) return false;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
    
    private static class Group {
        char character;
        int count;
        
        public Group(char character, int count) {
            this.character = character;
            this.count = count;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String S = "heeellooo";
        String[] words = {"hello", "hi", "helo"};
        System.out.println(expressiveWords(S, words));  // Output: 1
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Grouping Function**: O(n), where n is the length of the string because we traverse the string once.
- **Stretchy Check**: O(k), where k is the number of groups, which is bound by the length of the string.
- **Overall**: Worst case for each word, combining grouping and stretchy checks: O(m log p), where m is the length of the string `S` and p is the total length of all words in `words`.

The overall time complexity considering all words is O(m * w * k), where `w` is the number of words.
