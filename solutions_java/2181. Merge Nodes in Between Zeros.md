[Leetcode 2181. Merge Nodes in Between Zeros](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2181)
## Problem Statement

The problem "2181. Merge Nodes in Between Zeros" from LeetCode is described as follows:

You are given the head of a linked list, which contains a series of integers. The linked list is formed by merging multiple subsequences. Each subsequence in the linked list is formed by the integers appearing between two **0's** (exclusive). For example, the linked list **[0,3,1,0,4,5,2,0]** represents three subsequences **[3,1]**, **[4,5,2]**, and **[]** (between the pair of **0's** respectively).

Your task is to return a linked list where the values of the nodes are the sum of the integers in each subsequence formed between **0's** (exclusive). The new linked list should not contain any **0's**.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the initial and trailing zeros always guaranteed?**
   - Yes, each subsequence in the linked list is framed by **0**, both at the beginning and the end.

2. **Should I consider empty subsequences?**
   - Yes, the linked list will have segments between **0's** which might be empty. But the problem guarantees the sequence segments are represented by zero at both ends.

3. **What is the data structure for the linked list?**
   - The typical structure for a linked list node is provided.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Pointers:**
   - Use a pointer to traverse the list.
   - Use a dummy node to construct the new list.

2. **Traverse the List:**
   - Skip the initial zero.
   - For each zero encountered, sum up the values of nodes until the next zero is reached.
   - Append the summed value to the newly formed list.

3. **Skip Consecutive Zeroes:**
   - Only start summing after encountering a zero and stop before the next zero.

### Code

Here is the Java implementation of the solution:

```java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode() {}
    ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
    ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
}

public class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeNodes(ListNode head) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode current = dummy;
        ListNode ptr = head.next;
        
        while (ptr != null) {
            int sum = 0;
            
            // Sum values until next zero
            while (ptr != null && ptr.val != 0) {
                sum += ptr.val;
                ptr = ptr.next;
            }
            
            // Move pointer to the next node after zero
            if (ptr != null) {
                ptr = ptr.next;
            }
            
            // Add sum to the new list
            current.next = new ListNode(sum);
            current = current.next;
        }
        
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the original list. Each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), besides the space used for the input and output, no extra space proportional to the input size is used.

This should effectively solve the stated problem within optimal time constraints.
