[Leetcode 2274. Maximum Consecutive Floors Without Special Floors full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2274)
### Problem Statement:
You are given `bottom`, `top`, and an array named `special` of unique integers. These integers represent the floors in a building that are "special." You aim to find the maximum number of consecutive floors without a "special" floor.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Range:** What are the constraints on `bottom`, `top`, and the length of `special`?
2. **Ordering:** Is the `special` list sorted?
3. **Values in `special`:** Can we assume that all values in `special` are within the range `[bottom, top]`?

### Strategy:
1. **Sort the Special List:** Since `special` might not be sorted, we first sort it.
2. **Calculate Gaps:** Iterate through the sorted `special` list to calculate the gaps between consecutive "special" floors.
3. **Edge Cases:** Consider the gaps from `bottom` to the first "special" floor and from the last "special" floor to `top`.

### Code:
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MaxConsecutiveFloors {
    public int maxConsecutive(int bottom, int top, int[] special) {
        Arrays.sort(special);
        int maxGap = 0;

        // Gap between bottom and the first special floor
        maxGap = Math.max(maxGap, special[0] - bottom);

        // Gaps between the special floors
        for (int i = 1; i < special.length; i++) {
            maxGap = Math.max(maxGap, special[i] - special[i - 1] - 1);
        }

        // Gap between the last special floor and top
        maxGap = Math.max(maxGap, top - special[special.length - 1]);

        return maxGap;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaxConsecutiveFloors solution = new MaxConsecutiveFloors();
        
        // Example test case
        int bottom = 2;
        int top = 9;
        int[] special = {4, 6};

        // Should output 3
        System.out.println(solution.maxConsecutive(bottom, top, special));
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Sorting:** `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of elements in the `special` array.
- **Gap Calculation:** `O(n)` to iterate through the sorted `special` array.
- **Overall Complexity:** `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step being the most time-consuming operation.

This solution efficiently handles the problem constraints and calculates the maximum number of consecutive non-special floors within the given range.
