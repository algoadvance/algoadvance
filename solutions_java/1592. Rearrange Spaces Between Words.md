[Leetcode 1592. Rearrange Spaces Between Words](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1592)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `text` of words that are separated by spaces. Your task is to rearrange the spaces so that there is an equal number of spaces between each word and any extra spaces are placed at the end of the string.

For instance, consider the input string `text = "  this   is  a sentence "`. 
- The words are `"this"`, `"is"`, `"a"`, and `"sentence"`.
- There are 9 spaces in the input string.
- There are 4 words.

Your task is to partition the spaces as evenly as possible between the words, with any extra spaces flowing to the end. 

### Example

```plaintext
Input: text = "  this   is  a sentence "
Output: "this   is   a   sentence"
```

### Constraints

1. `1 <= text.length <= 100`
2. `text` consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters and ' ' (space) characters.
3. There is at least one word in `text`.

---

## Clarifying Questions

1. Do we need to handle both leading and trailing spaces?
   - Yes, the extra spaces should be added to the end of the resultant string if they do not evenly divide among the words.

2. Are words guaranteed to be separated by at least one space in the input?
   - Yes, they are separated by spaces as per the problem statement.

## Strategy

1. Split the input text into words using space as the delimiter.
2. Count the number of spaces in the original text.
3. Calculate the number of spaces needed between each word (`evenlyDistributedSpaces`).
4. Calculate the remaining spaces that need to go at the end (`remainingSpaces`).
5. Build the resultant string by joining the words with the computed number of spaces between each.
6. Append the remaining spaces to the end of the resultant string.

## Code

Here's the complete implementation in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public String reorderSpaces(String text) {
        // Split the text by spaces to get words
        String[] words = text.trim().split("\\s+");
        int totalSpaces = text.length() - text.replace(" ", "").length();
        int spaceBetweenWords = words.length > 1 ? totalSpaces / (words.length - 1) : 0;
        int extraSpaces = words.length > 1 ? totalSpaces % (words.length - 1) : totalSpaces;
        
        // Join words with `spaceBetweenWords` number of spaces.
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            if (i > 0) {
                for (int j = 0; j < spaceBetweenWords; j++) {
                    sb.append(' ');
                }
            }
            sb.append(words[i]);
        }
        
        // Add extra spaces at the end
        for (int i = 0; i < extraSpaces; i++) {
            sb.append(' ');
        }
        
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Splitting the text**: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input string.
- **Counting spaces**: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input string.
- **Building the result**: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the original input string (since we iterate over words and the spaces).
  
Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input string. 

This is efficient given the constraint that the maximum length of `text` can be 100 characters.
