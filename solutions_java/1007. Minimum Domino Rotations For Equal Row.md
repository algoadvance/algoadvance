[Leetcode 1007. Minimum Domino Rotations For Equal Row](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1007)
### Problem Statement

You are given two lists of integers `tops` and `bottoms` representing the top and bottom halves of dominoes respectively. Each domino has two numbers, one on the top and one on the bottom. Your goal is to make all the numbers in either the top or bottom lists the same by performing the minimum number of rotations. If it is not possible to achieve this, return `-1`.

Each rotation involves swapping the top and bottom numbers of a single domino.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - How many dominoes will each list contain?
     - Both lists `tops` and `bottoms` will have the same length `n` where `n` is between `2` and `2 * 10^4`.
   - What are the possible values for numbers on the dominos?
     - Each number on a domino is between `1` and `6`.

2. **Output**:
   - Return the minimum number of rotations needed to make either all the values in the top row the same or all the values in the bottom row the same.
   - Return `-1` if it's not possible.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will consider two candidate numbers from the `tops` and `bottoms` arrays as the potential number to fill either the top or bottom row:

1. **Candidate Numbers**: We will consider `tops[0]` and `bottoms[0]` as potential candidates for the number that we might be able to convert all tops or bottoms to. This is based on the rationale that if all dominos are to show the same number on one side, that number must at least be present in the first domino.

2. **Counting Rotations**: For each candidate number, we will count the minimum rotations required to make all numbers in the `tops` array or all numbers in the `bottoms` array equal to that candidate number. If it's impossible to make a particular candidate number uniform across any row, we skip that candidate.

3. **Comparing Results**: Finally, we compare the rotation counts for all candidates and take the minimum count among them. If no valid transformations exist, return `-1`.

### Code

```java
public class MinimumDominoRotations {
    public int minDominoRotations(int[] tops, int[] bottoms) {
        int n = tops.length;

        // These are the two potential values we might convert all elements to.
        int candidate1 = tops[0];
        int candidate2 = bottoms[0];

        // Helper method to calculate the number of rotations needed
        int rotationsForTop = check(candidate1, tops, bottoms, n);
        int rotationsForBottom = check(candidate2, tops, bottoms, n);

        if (rotationsForTop == -1 && rotationsForBottom == -1) {
            return -1;
        } else if (rotationsForTop == -1) {
            return rotationsForBottom;
        } else if (rotationsForBottom == -1) {
            return rotationsForTop;
        } else {
            return Math.min(rotationsForTop, rotationsForBottom);
        }
    }

    private int check(int candidate, int[] tops, int[] bottoms, int n) {
        int rotationsA = 0;
        int rotationsB = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (tops[i] != candidate && bottoms[i] != candidate) {
                return -1; // It's not possible to unify all values as candidate
            } else if (tops[i] != candidate) {
                rotationsA++; // Need a rotation to bring the candidate up
            } else if (bottoms[i] != candidate) {
                rotationsB++; // Need a rotation to bring the candidate down
            }
        }

        return Math.min(rotationsA, rotationsB);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumDominoRotations solution = new MinimumDominoRotations();
        int[] tops = {2, 1, 2, 4, 2, 2};
        int[] bottoms = {5, 2, 6, 2, 3, 2};
        System.out.println(solution.minDominoRotations(tops, bottoms)); // Output: 2

        tops = new int[]{3, 5, 1, 2, 3};
        bottoms = new int[]{3, 6, 3, 3, 4};
        System.out.println(solution.minDominoRotations(tops, bottoms)); // Output: -1
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of the solution is \(O(n)\) since we only perform a constant number of passes over the lists `tops` and `bottoms`. This ensures that the algorithm can handle the upper limit of input sizes efficiently.

### Conclusion

This approach ensures that we minimize the number of rotations needed to make all elements in either the top or bottom row the same, by focusing on the candidate values present at the start and efficiently counting necessary transformations.
