[Leetcode 1689. Partitioning Into Minimum Number Of Deci](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1689)
### Problem Statement

The problem "1689. Partitioning Into Minimum Number Of Deci-Binary Numbers" involves finding the minimum number of positive deci-binary numbers needed to sum up to a given number represented as a string `n`.

**Deci-binary** numbers are numbers that contain only 0s and 1s in their decimal representation, so each digit must be either 0 or 1.

For example:
- Given `n = "32"`, the output should be `3` because `32` can be written as "11" + "11" + "10".
- Given `n = "82734"`, the output should be `8`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format**: Will the input always be a non-empty string consisting of digits?
   - **Yes**, the input string `n` will always be non-empty and contain only digits (0-9).

2. **Output Format**: Should the function return an integer?
   - **Yes**, the function should return an integer that represents the minimum number of deci-binary numbers needed.

3. **Constraints**: What are the constraints on the size of `n`?
   - The length of `n` can be up to 100,000 characters.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, consider the properties of deci-binary numbers. Each digit in the string `n` must be formed by summing digits from deci-binary numbers, each being either 0 or 1. 

The key observation is:
- The minimum number of deci-binary numbers required is the maximum digit in `n`.

This is because:
- If the highest digit in `n` is `9`, you need at least 9 deci-binary numbers to achieve that digit since each deci-binary number contributes at most `1` to each digit place.

Therefore, the answer is simply the maximum digit in the string `n`.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int minPartitions(String n) {
        int maxDigit = 0;
        for (char c : n.toCharArray()) {
            int digit = c - '0';
            if (digit > maxDigit) {
                maxDigit = digit;
            }
            // If we find digit '9', we can immediately return 9, since it's the maximum possible.
            if (maxDigit == 9) {
                return 9;
            }
        }
        return maxDigit;
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: Start with `maxDigit` set to 0.
2. **Iteration**: Traverse each character in the string `n`.
   - Convert the character to its digit value.
   - Update `maxDigit` if the current digit is greater.
   - If the maximum digit `9` is found, return `9`. No higher digit exists, so this is the minimum number needed.
3. **Return**: After the loop, `maxDigit` holds the highest digit found in `n` which is the answer.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this approach is **O(N)**, where `N` is the length of the string `n` because we are iterating through each character in the string exactly once.

This solution is efficient given the constraints, with a linear pass through the input string, making it suitable for large inputs up to 100,000 characters.
