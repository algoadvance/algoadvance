[Leetcode 2348. Number of Zero](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2348)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of subarrays filled with `0`.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**: Are there any constraints on the size of the input array, `nums`?
   - Typically, constraints will guide our choice of algorithm.
2. **Data Type**: Will `nums` contain only integers?
   - This clarifies input validation if required.
3. **Output Range**: Is there a maximum or minimum size for the count value?
   - Helps in understanding if additional checks for integer overflow are needed.

Assuming typical constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- The output count will fit in a 64-bit integer.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use an approach that iterates through the array and counts the number of `0`s and the subarrays they form on-the-fly.

1. **Initialization**: We'll use a `zeroCount` variable to count consecutive `0`s during our iteration.
2. **Iteration**: Traverse through each element of `nums`:
   - If the element is `0`, increment `zeroCount`.
   - If the element is not `0`, then for the `zeroCount` number of zeros, they form subarrays:
     - There are `(zeroCount * (zeroCount + 1)) / 2` subarrays formed by `zeroCount` zeros.
   - Reset `zeroCount` whenever a non-zero element is encountered.
3. **Edge Case**: At the end of the loop, handle the case if the last element of `nums` is `0`. We must add the final count of subarrays.

This approach ensures a single pass through the array, making it efficient.

### Time Complexity

The algorithm runs in `O(n)` time complexity where `n` is the length of `nums`, because it only requires a single traversal of the array.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public long zeroFilledSubarray(int[] nums) {
        long result = 0;
        long zeroCount = 0;
        
        // Traverse through the array
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == 0) {
                zeroCount++;
            } else {
                // Calculate the number of subarrays formed by zeroCount zeros
                result += (zeroCount * (zeroCount + 1)) / 2;
                zeroCount = 0;
            }
        }
        
        // Handle the last set of zeros if the array ends with one or more zeros
        if (zeroCount > 0) {
            result += (zeroCount * (zeroCount + 1)) / 2;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

This code will return the number of zero-filled subarrays in `nums` as required by the problem statement.
