### Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 204: Count Primes

Given an integer `n`, return the number of prime numbers that are strictly less than `n`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of the input integer n?
     - Solution: The input integer \( n \) is in the range \([0, 5 \times 10^6]\).
   
2. **Edge Cases:**
   - How should the function handle values of n less than or equal to 2?
     - Solution: Return 0 since there are no prime numbers less than 2.

3. **Performance:**
   - Is there an efficient algorithm since the brute-force solution might not be feasible for large \( n \)?
     - Solution: Yes, we should consider using the Sieve of Eratosthenes for an optimal solution.

### Strategy

To count the number of prime numbers less than \( n \), we can use the **Sieve of Eratosthenes** technique:

1. **Initialize:** Create a boolean array `isPrime` of size \( n \) where each entry `isPrime[i]` will be `true` if `i` is a prime number, initially assuming all numbers are prime.
2. **Mark Non-Primes:** We will iterate through the numbers starting from 2. For each number `p` that is still marked as prime, mark all multiples of `p` (starting from \( p \times p \)) as non-prime.
3. **Count Primes:** The number of `true` values in the `isPrime` array from index 2 to \( n-1 \) will give the count of prime numbers less than \( n \).

### Code

```java
public class CountPrimes {
    public int countPrimes(int n) {
        if (n <= 2) return 0;

        boolean[] isPrime = new boolean[n];
        // Initialize all entries as true, except for index 0 and 1 which are not primes
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            isPrime[i] = true;
        }

        for (int i = 2; i * i < n; i++) {
            if (isPrime[i]) {
                for (int j = i * i; j < n; j += i) {
                    isPrime[j] = false;
                }
            }
        }

        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            if (isPrime[i]) count++;
        }

        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CountPrimes cp = new CountPrimes();
        System.out.println(cp.countPrimes(10));  // Output: 4 (2, 3, 5, 7)
        System.out.println(cp.countPrimes(0));   // Output: 0
        System.out.println(cp.countPrimes(1));   // Output: 0
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm is \( O(n \log \log n) \) because each prime number's multiples are marked in approximately \( O(\log \log n) \) operations. This is a near-linear time complexity, making it efficient for large values of \( n \).

### Edge Cases

- For \( n \leq 2 \), the function immediately returns 0 as there are no prime numbers less than 2.
- For large values of \( n \), the algorithm efficiently handles marking and counting primes using the sieve technique.
