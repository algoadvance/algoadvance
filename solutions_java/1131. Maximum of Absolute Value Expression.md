[Leetcode 1131. Maximum of Absolute Value Expression](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1131)
### Problem Statement

Given two arrays of integers `arr1` and `arr2` of the same length, the absolute value expression is defined as:
\[ |arr1[i] - arr1[j]| + |arr2[i] - arr2[j]| + |i - j| \]
where \(|x|\) denotes the absolute value of `x`.

You need to find the maximum value of this expression for all valid indices `i` and `j` (0 <= i, j < arr1.length).

### Clarifying Questions

Before diving into the solution, we should clarify some key points:
1. **Array Lengths**: Are the lengths of `arr1` and `arr2` always the same?
2. **Element Range**: What are the possible ranges for the elements within `arr1` and `arr2`?
3. **Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the time complexity due to large input sizes?

Assumption: Both arrays are non-empty and of the same length since the problem specifies "the same length".

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we need to break down the absolute value function and leverage mathematical properties to minimize the complexity. The inner terms can be evaluated under different sign combinations because absolute values can be distributed among possible positive and negative cases:

The expression can be expanded to:
\[ |arr1[i] - arr1[j]| + |arr2[i] - arr2[j]| + |i - j| \]

Let's decompose this:
1. \(S1: arr1[i] - arr1[j] + arr2[i] - arr2[j] + (i - j)\)
2. \(S2: arr1[i] - arr1[j] + arr2[i] - arr2[j] + (j - i)\)
3. \(S3: arr1[i] - arr1[j] + arr2[j] - arr2[i] + (i - j)\)
4. \(S4: arr1[i] - arr1[j] + arr2[j] - arr2[i] + (j - i)\)
5. \(S5: arr1[j] - arr1[i] + arr2[i] - arr2[j] + (i - j)\)
6. \(S6: arr1[j] - arr1[i] + arr2[i] - arr2[j] + (j - i)\)
7. \(S7: arr1[j] - arr1[i] + arr2[j] - arr2[i] + (i - j)\)
8. \(S8: arr1[j] - arr1[i] + arr2[j] - arr2[i] + (j - i)\)

We'll simplify these cases further by merging common terms:
\[ M1: arr1[i] + arr2[i] + i \]
\[ M2: arr1[i] + arr2[i] - i \]
\[ M3: arr1[i] - arr2[i] + i \]
\[ M4: arr1[i] - arr2[i] - i \]
\[ M5: -arr1[i] + arr2[i] + i \]
\[ M6: -arr1[i] + arr2[i] - i \]
\[ M7: -arr1[i] - arr2[i] + i \]
\[ M8: -arr1[i] - arr2[i] - i \]

We must find the maximum and minimum values for these merged expressions, then compute the differences.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxAbsValExpr(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
        int n = arr1.length;
        
        int[] M1 = new int[n];
        int[] M2 = new int[n];
        int[] M3 = new int[n];
        int[] M4 = new int[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            M1[i] = arr1[i] + arr2[i] + i;
            M2[i] = arr1[i] + arr2[i] - i;
            M3[i] = arr1[i] - arr2[i] + i;
            M4[i] = arr1[i] - arr2[i] - i;
        }
        
        int max1 = Integer.MIN_VALUE, min1 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int max2 = Integer.MIN_VALUE, min2 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int max3 = Integer.MIN_VALUE, min3 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int max4 = Integer.MIN_VALUE, min4 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            max1 = Math.max(max1, M1[i]);
            min1 = Math.min(min1, M1[i]);
            max2 = Math.max(max2, M2[i]);
            min2 = Math.min(min2, M2[i]);
            max3 = Math.max(max3, M3[i]);
            min3 = Math.min(min3, M3[i]);
            max4 = Math.max(max4, M4[i]);
            min4 = Math.min(min4, M4[i]);
        }
        
        int result = Math.max(Math.max(max1 - min1, max2 - min2), Math.max(max3 - min3, max4 - min4));
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the input arrays `arr1` and `arr2`. This is because we iterate through the arrays a constant number of times to compute the maximum and minimum values for each of the derived expressions. The space complexity is \(O(n)\) for the additional arrays used to store intermediate values.
