[Leetcode 188. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock IV](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l188)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the i-th day, and an integer `k`.

Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete at most `k` transactions.

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you can buy again).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are transactions limited by the sequence, i.e., buying has to be followed by selling without another buying in between?
   - **A:** Yes, you must sell before you can buy again.
   
2. **Q:** What is the value range for `k`?
   - **A:** `1 <= k <= 100`.

3. **Q:** What is the length range for `prices`?
   - **A:** `0 <= prices.length <= 1000`.

4. **Q:** If `prices` array is empty, should the output be zero?
   - **A:** Yes, if `prices` is empty, the maximum profit is zero.

### Strategy

This problem can be efficiently solved using Dynamic Programming (DP). The idea is to use a DP table where we track profits for each transaction up to `k` and for each day up to `n` (length of prices).

#### Steps:

1. **Base Case:** If `k` is 0 or prices is empty, the maximum profit is 0.
2. **DP Table:** Use a 2D DP table `dp[i][j]` where `i` represents the transaction count and `j` represents the day index.
3. **Transition:** For each transaction and day, we have two choices; do nothing or execute a transaction by buying at some previous day and selling on the current day.

#### DP Formulation:
- Initialize `dp[i][0] = 0` for all `i`.
- Initialize `dp[0][j] = 0` for all `j`.
- For `i = 1` to `k`:
  - Track `max_diff` which keeps the maximum difference of `dp[i-1][m] - prices[m]` for all `m < j`.
  - For `j = 1` to `n-1`:
    - Update `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j-1], prices[j] + max_diff)`.
    - Update `max_diff = max(max_diff, dp[i-1][j] - prices[j])`.

#### Time Complexity:
- The solution is `O(k*n)`, where `k` is the number of transactions and `n` is the size of `prices`.

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int k, int[] prices) {
        int n = prices.length;
        if (n == 0 || k == 0) return 0;

        // If k >= n / 2, then we can make maximum number of transactions.
        if (k >= n / 2) {
            int maxProfit = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
                if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
                    maxProfit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
                }
            }
            return maxProfit;
        }

        // DP array
        int[][] dp = new int[k + 1][n];

        for (int i = 1; i <= k; i++) {
            int maxDiff = -prices[0];
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j - 1], prices[j] + maxDiff);
                maxDiff = Math.max(maxDiff, dp[i - 1][j] - prices[j]);
            }
        }

        return dp[k][n - 1];
    }
}
```

In this solution, we account for cases where `k` is large in comparison to `n` by simplifying to the unlimited transactions case. This ensures efficiency for the given constraints while maintaining clarity and correctness.
