[Leetcode 1334. Find the City With the Smallest Number of Neighbors at a Threshold Distance](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1334)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n`, the number of cities, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [from_i, to_i, weight_i]` represents a bidirectional and weighted edge between cities `from_i` and `to_i`. You are also given an integer `distanceThreshold`.

Return the city with the smallest number of cities that are reachable within `distanceThreshold`. If there are multiple cities with the same number of reachable cities, return the city with the greatest number.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the inputs?**
   - The number of cities `n` can be at most 100.
   - The number of edges `edges.length` can be at most 4600.

2. **Can there be multiple edges between the same pair of cities?**
   - Yes, but we should only consider the minimum weight edge between any two cities for our computation.

3. **Is the distance from a city to itself considered within the threshold?**
   - Yes, the distance from a city to itself is 0, which is always within the threshold.

## Strategy

- Use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find the shortest paths between all pairs of cities. This algorithm is suitable given the constraints (`n <= 100`), and it can compute shortest paths in O(n^3) time complexity.
- After computing the shortest path matrix, count how many cities are reachable from each city within the given `distanceThreshold`.
- Identify the city with the smallest number of reachable cities. In case of a tie, return the city with the greatest index.

## Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class CityWithSmallestNeighbors {
    public int findTheCity(int n, int[][] edges, int distanceThreshold) {
        final int INF = 10001; // given max distance is edges[i][2] <= 10^4
        int[][] dist = new int[n][n];

        // Initialize the distance matrix
        for (int[] row : dist) {
            Arrays.fill(row, INF);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dist[i][i] = 0;
        }

        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0], v = edge[1], w = edge[2];
            dist[u][v] = w;
            dist[v][u] = w;
        }

        // Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find all pairs shortest path
        for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                    if (dist[i][k] + dist[k][j] < dist[i][j]) {
                        dist[i][j] = dist[i][k] + dist[k][j];
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        int minReachableCities = n;
        int resultCity = -1;

        // Count reachable cities within distanceThreshold for each city
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i != j && dist[i][j] <= distanceThreshold) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            // If this city has fewer reachable cities, or same number but higher index, update result
            if (count < minReachableCities || (count == minReachableCities && i > resultCity)) {
                minReachableCities = count;
                resultCity = i;
            }
        }

        return resultCity;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CityWithSmallestNeighbors solution = new CityWithSmallestNeighbors();
        int n = 4;
        int[][] edges = {
            {0, 1, 3},
            {1, 2, 1},
            {1, 3, 4},
            {2, 3, 1}
        };
        int distanceThreshold = 4;
        System.out.println(solution.findTheCity(n, edges, distanceThreshold)); // Expected output: 3
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:** O(n^3) where `n` is the number of cities
- **Reachability Check:** O(n^2)
  
Overall, the time complexity is O(n^3), which is efficient given the problem constraints (`n <= 100`).
