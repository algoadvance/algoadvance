[Leetcode 1111. Maximum Nesting Depth of Two Valid Parentheses Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1111)
### Problem Statement
Given a valid parentheses string `s`, consider its primitive decomposition: `(A1)(A2)...(An)`, where `Ai` are primitive valid parentheses strings (defined by the fact that they are non-empty and that no two distinct primitive substrings can be concatenated to form another valid parentheses string).

A valid parentheses string is either:
- `""` (an empty string),
- or it can be written as `AB` (A concatenated with B), where `A` and `B` are valid parentheses strings,
- or it can be written as `(A)`, where `A` is a valid parentheses string.

We define the *nesting depth* of `s` to be the maximum depth of nested parentheses, which can be computed using the traverse method. Given a valid parentheses string `s` of length `n`, your task is to split it into two disjoint subarrays (substrings) such that both subarrays have the maximum possible depth but they don't intersect each other.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are there any constraints on the string length?
   - The problem statement typically assumes that `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`.

2. Can we assume the input string `s` is always valid?
   - Yes, as per the problem definition, `s` is a valid parentheses string.

3. Are there any specific requirements for how the substrings should be split?
   - The goal is to split the string into two disjoint substrings where each substring can have a maximum depth of nested parentheses.

### Strategy
We can leverage the validity of the parentheses and use a balance counter to determine at what depth a given parenthesis occurs. By processing each parenthesis and assigning depth information, we can determine how to split the string so that the two substrings formed from it maintain maximum depth. Here is the step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize variables to keep track of the balance of the parentheses string as we iterate through it.
2. Use the balance to decide whether a parenthesis should go into the first or second group such that both groups maintain approximately the same maximum nesting depth.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] maxDepthAfterSplit(String seq) {
        int n = seq.length();
        int[] result = new int[n];
        int balance = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            char c = seq.charAt(i);
            if (c == '(') {
                // If balance is even, assign to group 0, otherwise to group 1
                result[i] = balance % 2;
                balance++;
            } else {
                balance--;
                // If balance after decrementing was even, it means this ')' balanced an inner '(', so group 0; else group 1
                result[i] = balance % 2;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) - We iterate over each character of the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) - We use an array to store the result which will have the same length as the input string.

This solution ensures that we distribute parentheses between two groups to achieve the desired depth balance effectively.
