[Leetcode 2857. Count Pairs of Points With Distance k](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2857)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `k` and an array `points` where each `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on a 2D plane. Return the number of pairs (i, j) such that the distance between the points `points[i]` and `points[j]` is exactly `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Distance Metric**: Should we use Euclidean distance for measuring the distance between points, or can we use another metric like Manhattan distance?
2. **Value of Points**: Are the points guaranteed to have integer coordinates?
3. **Constraints**: What are the constraints on `k` and the coordinates in `points`? This can help determine if optimization is necessary.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will make a couple of assumptions given typical constraints:
1. **Euclidean Distance** is used: \( \sqrt{(x2 - x1)² + (y2 - y1)²} = k \).
2. **Only integer distances**: This problem can be simplified if we consider that only integer distances are to be worked with. 

We need to iterate over each pair of points and check the distance between them. If the distance matches `k`, we will count that pair.

### Code Implementation

```java
import java.util.*;

public class CountPairsDistanceK {
    public int countPairs(int[][] points, int k) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < points.length; j++) {
                // Calculate Euclidean distance squared (to avoid floating-point imprecision)
                int dx = points[i][0] - points[j][0];
                int dy = points[i][1] - points[j][1];
                int distanceSquared = dx * dx + dy * dy;
                
                // Compare the square of k with calculated squared distance
                if (distanceSquared == k * k) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CountPairsDistanceK solution = new CountPairsDistanceK();
        int[][] points = // use example from above
        int k = 5;
        System.out.println(solution.countPairs(points, k));  // Example usage
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity for this approach is \( O(n^2) \) where \( n \) is the number of points because we are using a double nested loop to check each pair of points.

2. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \( O(1) \) as we are not using any additional space proportional to the input size.

This simple brute-force approach should be acceptable for relatively small datasets. For larger datasets, further optimization may be required, potentially involving data structures like spatial hashes or sorting-based solutions to reduce the search space.
