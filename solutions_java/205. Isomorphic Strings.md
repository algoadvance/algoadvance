[Leetcode 205. Isomorphic Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l205)
## Problem Statement
Given two strings `s` and `t`, determine if they are isomorphic. Two strings are isomorphic if the characters in `s` can be replaced to get `t`.

All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "egg", t = "add"
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "foo", t = "bar"
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "paper", t = "title"
Output: true
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `t.length == s.length`
- `s` and `t` consist of any valid ASCII character.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Do we consider an empty string to be isomorphic with another empty string?
   **A**: Yes, since they trivially satisfy the condition of having no characters to map between the two.

2. **Q**: Are the strings always of the same length?
   **A**: Yes, as per the problem statement `t.length == s.length`.

3. **Q**: Can we assume the strings contain only printable ASCII characters?
   **A**: Yes, the problem states they consist of any valid ASCII character.

## Strategy
1. **Character Mapping**: Use two hash maps to maintain mapping from `s` to `t` and `t` to `s`.
2. **Validation**: As we iterate through the characters of both strings, update both hash maps. If any inconsistency is found (i.e., a character from `s` maps to a different character in `t` than expected or vice versa), return `false`.

## Code
```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public boolean isIsomorphic(String s, String t) {
        if (s.length() != t.length()) return false;

        HashMap<Character, Character> mapS = new HashMap<>();
        HashMap<Character, Character> mapT = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char charS = s.charAt(i);
            char charT = t.charAt(i);
            
            if (mapS.containsKey(charS)) {
                if (mapS.get(charS) != charT) {
                    return false;
                }
            } else {
                mapS.put(charS, charT);
            }
            
            if (mapT.containsKey(charT)) {
                if (mapT.get(charT) != charS) {
                    return false;
                }
            } else {
                mapT.put(charT, charS);
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm runs in `O(n)` time, where `n` is the length of the strings. We iterate through each character of the strings exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(1)` since the hash map will at most store a character mapping for all unique characters of the ASCII set, which is constant in size (256 characters).
