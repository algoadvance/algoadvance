### Problem Statement

**Leetcode 744: Find Smallest Letter Greater Than Target**

Given a list of sorted characters `letters` containing only lowercase letters, and a target character `target`, the task is to find the smallest character in the list that is larger than the given target character. If no such character exists, you should return the first character in the list.

#### Example:
- **Input:** `letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "a"`
  - **Output:** `"c"`
- **Input:** `letters = ["c","f","j"], target = "c"`
  - **Output:** `"f"`
- **Input:** `letters = ["x","x","y","y"], target = "z"`
  - **Output:** `"x"`

#### Constraints:
- `2 <= letters.length <= 10^4`
- `letters` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `letters` is sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `letters` contains at least two different characters.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the list `letters` contain duplicate letters?
   - **A:** Yes, the list can contain duplicates, but the list is always sorted and contains at least two different characters.
   
2. **Q:** What should be returned if all the characters in the list are less than or equal to the target?
   - **A:** Return the first character in the list.

### Strategy
To find the smallest character greater than the target, we can use a binary search approach due to the following reasons:
1. The list `letters` is sorted, which makes binary search an optimal choice.
2. Binary search will allow us to perform the search in logarithmic time.

Here is the plan:
1. Initialize `low` to 0 and `high` to the length of the list.
2. Perform binary search:
   - Compute the middle index `mid`.
   - If `letters[mid]` is less than or equal to `target`, move the `low` pointer to `mid + 1`.
   - If `letters[mid]` is greater than `target`, move the `high` pointer to `mid`.
3. Once the loop ends, the `low` pointer should be at the smallest character that is greater than the target. If `low` reaches the end of the list, wrap around to the first character.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public char nextGreatestLetter(char[] letters, char target) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = letters.length;
        
        // Perform binary search
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (letters[mid] <= target) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid;
            }
        }
        
        // Since the array is circular
        return letters[low % letters.length];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is \(O(\log n)\) due to the binary search algorithm, where \(n\) is the length of the `letters` array.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as we are using only a fixed amount of additional space regardless of the input size.

This approach ensures that we efficiently and correctly determine the smallest character greater than the given target in the sorted list.
