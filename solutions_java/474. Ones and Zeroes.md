[Leetcode 474. Ones and Zeroes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l474)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of binary strings `strs` and two integers `m` and `n`.

- Return the size of the largest subset of `strs` such that there are at most `m` `0`s and `n` `1`s in the subset.
- A subset is a combination of elements obtained by deleting some (possibly none) of the array elements.

##### Example 1:
- Input: `strs = ["10","0001","111001","1","0"], m = 5, n = 3`
- Output: 4
- Explanation: The largest subset with at most 5 zeroes and 3 ones is `{"10", "0001", "1", "0"}`, thus the answer is 4.

##### Example 2:
- Input: `strs = ["10","0","1"], m = 1, n = 1`
- Output: 2
- Explanation: The largest subset is `{"0", "1"}`, so the answer is 2.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints for `m` and `n`?**
    - `1 <= strs.length <= 600`
    - `1 <= strs[i].length <= 100`
    - `strs[i]` consists only of '0' and '1'.
    - `1 <= m, n <= 100`

2. **Should the subset maintain order?**
    - No, the subset does not need to maintain order.

3. **Are empty subsets allowed?**
    - While valid, they would not contribute to maximizing the size of the subset, so they are not practically useful for solving the problem.

### Strategy

We can solve this problem using Dynamic Programming. The idea is to create a DP array `dp[i][j]` which represents the maximum size of the subset that can be formed with at most `i` zeros and `j` ones.

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize a DP array `dp` of size `(m+1) x (n+1)` with all zeros as initially, with zero `0`s and `1`s, no subset can be formed other than the empty one.

2. **Iterating through `strs`:**
   - For each string in `strs`, count the number of `0`s and `1`s.
   - Update the DP array from the bottom-right corner to top-left corner to avoid re-using the same string in multiple counts unintentionally.

3. **DP Transition:**
   - If a string has `zeros` number of `0`s and `ones` number of `1`s, for each `dp[i][j]` from `m` to `zeros` and `n` to `ones`, we check:
     ```
     dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], 1 + dp[i - zeros][j - ones])
     ```

4. **Result:**
   - The value `dp[m][n]` will contain the maximum size of the subset we seek.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is \(O(len \cdot m \cdot n)\) where `len` is the length of `strs`. This is because we iterate through all strings and for each string, we update the `m x n` DP array.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {

    public int findMaxForm(String[] strs, int m, int n) {

        int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];

        for (String str : strs) {
            int zeros = 0, ones = 0;

            // Count the number of 0s and 1s in the current string
            for (char c : str.toCharArray()) {
                if (c == '0') zeros++;
                else ones++;
            }

            // Update the dp array from bottom to top to prevent reuse
            for (int i = m; i >= zeros; i--) {
                for (int j = n; j >= ones; j--) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i - zeros][j - ones] + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[m][n];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        String[] strs = {"10", "0001", "111001", "1", "0"};
        int m = 5;
        int n = 3;
        System.out.println(solution.findMaxForm(strs, m, n)); // Output: 4
    }
}
```

This code initializes the DP array, processes each string to update the DP values, and finally returns the maximum subset size that meets the criteria.
