[Leetcode 2518. Number of Great Partitions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2518)
### Problem Statement

We are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. We define a partition of the array as "great" if the sum of each subset in the partition is at least `k`. We need to find the number of great partitions of the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the input values?**
    - Typically, constraints on array length `N` and values in the array should be known.
2. **Can there be duplicate values in the array?**
    - Confirm if the array can contain duplicates.
3. **What is the range of `k`?**
    - Understand the acceptable range of the integer `k`.
4. **Does the array need to be non-empty?**
    - Confirm if the array will always have at least one element.
5. **Is the partition split into exactly two subsets, or can it be more?**
    - Clarify how many subsets the array should be partitioned into.

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the Partitioning:**
    - We need to partition the array such that the sum of elements in each subset is at least `k`.
    - If the total sum of the array is less than `2*k`, it's impossible to create two subsets each with sum `>= k`.

2. **Counting Subsets:**
    - Use dynamic programming to find all possible sums that can be made from elements of the subset.
    - Sum up all these subsets to count how many of them satisfy the condition.

3. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
    - Use a boolean array `dp` where `dp[i]` indicates if a subset sum of `i` is possible.
    - Iterate through each number in the array and update the `dp` array accordingly.
    - Count the possible sums from the `dp` array to see if we can form subsets with sum `>= k`.

### Code

Here is a Java implementation to solve the problem using the described strategy:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int countGreatPartitions(int[] nums, int k) {
        int totalSum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            totalSum += num;
        }
        // Minimum total required to form two subsets with sums >= k
        if (totalSum < 2 * k) {
            return 0;
        }

        int n = nums.length;
        int[] dp = new int[k];
        dp[0] = 1;  // base case: there's one way to get sum 0, which is taking no elements
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            for (int j = k - 1; j >= num; j--) {
                dp[j] += dp[j - num];
            }
        }
        
        // Calculate subsets that can contribute to sum >= k
        int totalSubsets = 1 << n;  // total number of subsets is 2^n
        int countInvalidSubsets = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            countInvalidSubsets += dp[i];
        }
        
        // since the partition splits into two subsets
        return (totalSubsets - 2 * countInvalidSubsets);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n * k)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array, and `k` is the target sum for each subset.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(k)` due to the `dp` array used to store possible sums.

### Explanation

1. **Calculate the Total Sum:** Sum all elements in the array. If the total sum is not at least `2 * k`, return `0` immediately as it is impossible to partition the array as required.
2. **Dynamic Programming Array Initialization:** Initialize a DP array `dp` that keeps track of possible subset sums up to `k`.
3. **Update DP Array:** Iterate through each number in `nums`, update the `dp` array from back to front to avoid overwriting results from the same iteration.
4. **Count Invalid Subsets:** Calculate the number of subsets with sums less than `k`.
5. **Calculate Valid Partitions:** Subtract twice the number of invalid subsets (since each invalid subset has a complement that is also invalid) from the total number of possible subsets (which is `2^n`). 

This solution effectively handles the counting of partitions that meet the constraints given in the problem.
