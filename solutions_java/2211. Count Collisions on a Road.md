[Leetcode 2211. Count Collisions on a Road](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2211)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `directions`, where each letter represents the direction a car is moving in a lane. The characters could be:
- 'L' meaning the car is moving to the left,
- 'R' meaning the car is moving to the right,
- 'S' meaning the car is stopped.

A collision happens when:
- A car moving to the right ('R') collides with a car moving to the left ('L') or a stopped car ('S').
- A car moving to the left ('L') collides with a car moving to the right ('R').

When a collision occurs:
- The moving cars become stopped cars.

You need to count the total number of collisions that will happen on the road.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the string `directions` be empty?**
   - No, the string will contain at least one character representing a car's direction.
2. **Is the length of the `directions` string limited to a certain value?**
   - It's within the typical constraints for such interview problems, say up to 10^5 characters.

### Strategy
- We will simulate the process of car movements.
- When we encounter 'R', it indicates a potential for future collisions as cars moving to the right can collide with subsequent 'L' or 'S'.
- When we encounter 'L', it indicates a possible immediate collision if there are any preceding 'R' cars.
- When we encounter 'S', it will stop any active 'R' cars from continuing beyond it, leading to a collision.
- We will iterate through the string, track active 'R' cars and count collisions based on the current character.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int countCollisions(String directions) {
        int collisions = 0;
        int activeRightCars = 0;
        
        for (char dir : directions.toCharArray()) {
            if (dir == 'R') {
                // Car moving to the right, potential future collision
                activeRightCars++;
            } else if (dir == 'L') {
                // Car moving to the left, immediate collision with any active 'R' cars
                if (activeRightCars > 0) {
                    collisions += activeRightCars + 1; // all active 'R' cars + current 'L' car collide
                    activeRightCars = 0;
                }
            } else if (dir == 'S') {
                // Car stopped, any active 'R' cars will collide with this stopped car
                if (activeRightCars > 0) {
                    collisions += activeRightCars; // all active 'R' cars collide
                    activeRightCars = 0;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return collisions;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the `directions` string. We are iterating through the string once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), we are using a constant amount of extra space.
