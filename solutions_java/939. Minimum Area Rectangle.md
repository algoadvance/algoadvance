[Leetcode 939. Minimum Area Rectangle full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l939)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of points in the X-Y plane, `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`. Return the minimum area of a rectangle formed from these points, with sides parallel to the X and Y axes. If there is no rectangle formed, return 0.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum number of points?**
   - This can help us understand if the solution needs to be optimized for larger inputs.
   
2. **Are the points always distinct?**
   - This helps to avoid unnecessary handling of duplicated points.

3. **Can we assume all coordinates will be within a certain range (e.g., -10^4 to 10^4)?**
   - Helps to determine if any special considerations for large coordinates are needed.

### Strategy

1. **Use a Set for Fast Lookup:**
   - Store each point in a set for O(1) lookup time.
  
2. **Iterate Through Pairs of Points:**
   - For each pair of points, treat them as potential diagonally opposite corners of a rectangle.
   - To form a rectangle, the other two corners must also be in the set.
  
3. **Calculate Area:**
   - If the other two corners exist, calculate the area of the rectangle.
   - Track the minimum area found during the iterations.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - No rectangles can be formed if there are less than 4 points.
   - Handle cases where points might be collinear.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int minAreaRect(int[][] points) {
        // Convert the array of point into a set of strings for easy lookup
        Set<String> pointSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (int[] point : points) {
            pointSet.add(point[0] + "," + point[1]);
        }

        int minArea = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int n = points.length;
        
        // Iterate through each pair of points
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                int[] p1 = points[i];
                int[] p2 = points[j];
                
                // Skip if current points are the same or they don't form the diagonal of a rectangle
                if (p1[0] == p2[0] || p1[1] == p2[1]) {
                    continue;
                }
                
                // Check if the other two corners exist
                if (pointSet.contains(p1[0] + "," + p2[1]) && pointSet.contains(p2[0] + "," + p1[1])) {
                    int area = Math.abs(p1[0] - p2[0]) * Math.abs(p1[1] - p2[1]);
                    minArea = Math.min(minArea, area);
                }
            }
        }

        return minArea == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? 0 : minArea;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2)
  - Iterating through each pair of points results in O(n^2) comparisons.
  - Set lookups and inserts are O(1) on average.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - The set contains up to n points.

This solution should efficiently handle the problem for reasonably large inputs up to the provided constraints.
