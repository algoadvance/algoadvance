[Leetcode 763. Partition Labels](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l763)
### Problem Statement:
Given a string `s`, partition it into as many parts as possible so that each letter appears in at most one part, and return a list of integers representing the size of these parts.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. What is the range of length for string `s`?
   - The length of `s` is from 1 to 500.
2. Does the string contain only lowercase English letters?
   - Yes, the string contains only lowercase English letters.

### Strategy:
1. **Last Occurrence Index**:
   - First, create an array (or hashmap) to store the last index of each character in the string.
2. **Partitioning**:
   - Iterate through the string while maintaining two pointers: `start` and `end`.
   - `start` denotes the beginning of the current partition, and `end` denotes the farthest point we need to go to include the current character.
   - For each character, update the `end` pointer to be the maximum of its current value and the last occurrence index of the current character.
   - When the current index reaches the `end` pointer, it means a partition can be made. Record the size of this partition and update the `start` pointer to the next character.
   
### Code:
```java
import java.util.*;

public class PartitionLabels {
    public List<Integer> partitionLabels(String s) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Step 1: Record the last occurrence index of each character
        int[] lastOccurrences = new int[26]; // Since there are 26 lowercase English letters
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            lastOccurrences[s.charAt(i) - 'a'] = i;
        }
        
        // Step 2: Iterate through the string and partition
        int start = 0, end = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            end = Math.max(end, lastOccurrences[s.charAt(i) - 'a']);
            
            if (i == end) {
                // End of the current partition
                result.add(end - start + 1);
                start = end + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PartitionLabels solution = new PartitionLabels();
        String s = "ababcbacadefegdehijhklij";
        List<Integer> result = solution.partitionLabels(s);
        System.out.println(result); // Output should be [9, 7, 8]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we make one pass to record the last occurrence of each character and another pass to create the partitions.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), because the array `lastOccurrences` is of fixed size (26) and we use a few additional variables, regardless of the input size.

This solution should efficiently solve the problem while ensuring that each character appears in at most one partition, as required.
