[Leetcode 1383. Maximum Performance of a Team](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1383)
## Problem Statement

You are given two integers `n` (number of engineers) and `k` (maximum number of engineers in the team), and two arrays `speed` and `efficiency`, both of length `n`. The `i-th` engineer has a speed `speed[i]` and efficiency `efficiency[i]`. We need to form a team with at most `k` engineers, and the performance of a team is defined as the sum of their speeds multiplied by the minimum efficiency among them.

Find the maximum performance of this team and return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Example:
```
Input: n = 6, k = 2, speed = [2,10,3,1,5,8], efficiency = [5,4,3,9,7,2]
Output: 60
Explanation: 
We can choose engineers 2 (with speed=10 and efficiency=4) and 5 (with speed=5 and efficiency=7). 
Maximum performance = (10 + 5) * min(4, 7) = 60.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Should I assume that all elements in the input arrays are positive integers?
2. Can the sizes of the speed and efficiency arrays be different than `n`?
3. Is there any significance to the ordering of the engineers in the input?

## Strategy

1. **Sorting by Efficiency:** Since the performance is constrained by the minimum efficiency, it makes sense to consider engineers with higher efficiency first. Thus, sort engineers by their efficiency in descending order.
2. **Maintaining a Heap:** To always maintain the top-k speeds, use a min-heap (priority queue). This helps efficiently manage the current pool of speeds, ensuring we can quickly remove the smallest speed when a new engineer is added beyond the `k` limit.
3. **Iterate and Calculate:** Iterate over the sorted list of engineers, simultaneously maintaining the sum of the top speeds (current team speed). At each step, calculate the performance and update the maximum performance.
4. **Modulo Operation:** As required, ensure the final result is returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MaximumPerformance {
    public int maxPerformance(int n, int k, int[] speed, int[] efficiency) {
        final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;
        
        // Pair efficiency and speed together
        int[][] engineers = new int[n][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            engineers[i][0] = efficiency[i];
            engineers[i][1] = speed[i];
        }

        // Sort by efficiency in decreasing order
        Arrays.sort(engineers, (a, b) -> b[0] - a[0]);
        
        // Use a min-heap to keep track of the k highest speeds
        PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(k);
        long speedSum = 0;
        long maxPerformance = 0;
        
        for (int[] engineer : engineers) {
            int currEfficiency = engineer[0];
            int currSpeed = engineer[1];
            
            // If we already have k engineers, remove the one with the smallest speed
            if (minHeap.size() == k) {
                speedSum -= minHeap.poll();
            }
            // Add new speed to both min-heap and speedSum
            minHeap.add(currSpeed);
            speedSum += currSpeed;
            
            // Calculate performance with the current engineer as the least efficient
            long performance = speedSum * currEfficiency;
            maxPerformance = Math.max(maxPerformance, performance);
        }
        
        return (int)(maxPerformance % MOD);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximumPerformance mp = new MaximumPerformance();
        int n = 6, k = 2;
        int[] speed = {2, 10, 3, 1, 5, 8};
        int[] efficiency = {5, 4, 3, 9, 7, 2};
        
        System.out.println(mp.maxPerformance(n, k, speed, efficiency)); // Output: 60
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** \(O(n \log n)\) to sort the engineers by efficiency.
- **Heap Operations:** Each insertion and deletion operation in the min-heap takes \(O(\log k)\). Thus, for `n` operations, it is \(O(n \log k)\).

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n \log n + n \log k)\).

This approach ensures efficient performance in both sorting engineers and maintaining the top-k speeds.
