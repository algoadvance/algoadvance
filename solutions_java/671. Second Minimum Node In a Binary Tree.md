### Problem Statement
LeetCode Problem 671: Second Minimum Node In a Binary Tree

Given a non-empty special binary tree consisting of nodes with the non-negative value, where each node in this tree has exactly two or zero sub-node. If the node has two sub-nodes, then this node's value is the smaller value among its two sub-nodes. More formally, the property `root.val = min(root.left.val, root.right.val)` always holds.

Find the second minimum value in this tree. If no such second minimum value exists, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the structure of the tree?**
   - Each node has either **0** or **2** children.
2. **Are the node values distinct?**
   - No, multiple nodes can have the same value.
3. **What is guaranteed about the tree?**
   - The root node has the smallest value as per the property mentioned.
4. **Can there be only one unique value in the tree?**
   - Yes, if all nodes have the same value, return -1 as per the rules.

### Strategy
1. **Initial Checks**:
   - If the tree is empty (though the problem states it is not), return -1.
   - If both left and right children are not present, return -1 since there can't be a second minimum.
   
2. **Traversal**:
   - Use a Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree.
   - Track the minimum and the second minimum values.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - Use a helper function to perform DFS.
   - Start the second minimum value as `Long.MAX_VALUE` (to handle larger secondary values).

### Code
Here is the Java code to solve the problem:

```java
public class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode() {}
    TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
    TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

public class Solution {
    public int findSecondMinimumValue(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null || (root.left == null && root.right == null)) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        return dfs(root, root.val);
    }

    private int dfs(TreeNode node, int minValue) {
        if (node == null) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        if (node.val > minValue) {
            return node.val;
        }
        
        int left = dfs(node.left, minValue);
        int right = dfs(node.right, minValue);
        
        if (left > minValue && right > minValue) {
            return Math.min(left, right);
        }
        
        return left > minValue ? left : right;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree because we might visit each node once.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(h)\), where \(h\) is the height of the tree due to the recursive call stack. In the worst-case scenario (a completely unbalanced tree), this could be \(O(n)\). For a balanced tree, it would be \(O(\log n)\).

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the second minimum value by traversing the tree effectively while adhering to the problem's requirements.
