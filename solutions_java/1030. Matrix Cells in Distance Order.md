[Leetcode 1030. Matrix Cells in Distance Order](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1030)
## Problem Statement

Given the integers `R` and `C` denoting the dimensions of a matrix, and the integers `r0` and `c0` denoting the coordinates of a cell in the matrix, return the coordinates of all cells in the matrix, sorted by their distance from `(r0, c0)`. The distance between two cells `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` is calculated as `|r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|` (Manhattan Distance).

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - `1 <= R, C <= 100`
   - `0 <= r0 < R`
   - `0 <= c0 < C`

2. **Output Format:**
   - A list of lists, where each inner list contains two integers indicating the coordinates `[row, col]`.

3. **Expected Output:**
   - All cells in the matrix presented in ascending order of their distance from `(r0, c0)`.

## Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Comparator;
import java.util.List;

public class MatrixCellsInDistanceOrder {

    public int[][] allCellsDistOrder(int R, int C, int r0, int c0) {
        int[][] result = new int[R * C][2];
        int index = 0;
        
        // Collect all the cells in the matrix
        for (int r = 0; r < R; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < C; c++) {
                result[index++] = new int[]{r, c};
            }
        }
        
        // Sort the cells based on their distance from (r0, c0)
        Arrays.sort(result, new Comparator<int[]>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(int[] a, int[] b) {
                int dist1 = Math.abs(a[0] - r0) + Math.abs(a[1] - c0);
                int dist2 = Math.abs(b[0] - r0) + Math.abs(b[1] - c0);
                return Integer.compare(dist1, dist2);
            }
        });
        
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MatrixCellsInDistanceOrder solution = new MatrixCellsInDistanceOrder();
        int[][] result = solution.allCellsDistOrder(2, 3, 1, 2);
        
        for (int[] cell : result) {
            System.out.println(Arrays.toString(cell));
        }
    }
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Matrix Generation:**
   - Create an `R x C` matrix and populate it with the indices of all the cells. This is done using nested loops where each cell's coordinates are stored in an `int[][]`.

2. **Sorting:**
   - Use a custom comparator to sort the cells based on their Manhattan distance from the given `(r0, c0)` coordinates. The Manhattan distance is calculated using the formula `|r1 - r0| + |c1 - c0|` for each cell.

3. **Return the Result:**
   - Return the sorted array of coordinates.

## Time Complexity

- **Matrix Cell Generation:** O(R * C)
- **Sorting:** O((R * C) log(R * C)) due to the sorting of the matrix cells

Hence, the overall time complexity is `O((R * C) log(R * C))` when considering both matrix generation and sorting steps.
