[Leetcode 1962. Remove Stones to Minimize the Total full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1962)
### Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `piles`, where `piles[i]` represents the number of stones in the `i-th` pile. Every **operation**, you can choose any pile of stones and remove half of the stones (rounded down). Return the **minimum** possible total number of stones remaining after exactly `k` operations.

#### Example 1:
Input: `piles = [5,4,9], k = 2`
Output: `12`
Explanation: Steps:
1. Choose the third pile, remove 4 or 4.5 stones (9 -> 4.5), round it down to 4 stones, piles = [5,4,5]
2. Choose the first pile, remove 2 stones, piles = [3,4,5]
The total number of stones left is `3 + 4 + 5 = 12`

#### Example 2:
Input: `piles = [4,3,6,7], k = 3`
Output: `12`
Explanation: Steps:
1. Choose the fourth pile, remove 3.5 stones, round it down to 3, piles = [4,3,6,3]
2. Choose the third pile, remove 3 stones, piles = [4,3,3,3]
3. Choose the first pile, remove 2 stones, piles = [2,3,3,3]
The total number of stones left is `2 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 11`

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can piles be empty? (Assume they cannot be for this problem since k > 0 implies there are stones to operate on)
2. Can pile sizes or k be very large? (Yes, consider efficiency for larger inputs)
3. How is "round down" handled? (Using integer division)

### Strategy
1. Use a **max-heap (priority queue)** to always select the pile with the maximum number of stones to minimize the stones efficiently.
2. Perform `k` operations:
   - Extract the maximum element from the max-heap.
   - Remove half of the stones from this pile.
   - Insert the updated pile size back into the heap.
3. Sum the remaining elements in the heap for the final answer.

### Code
```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public class Solution {
    public int minStoneSum(int[] piles, int k) {
        // Create a max-heap 
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b - a);
        
        // Add all pile sizes to the heap
        for (int pile : piles) {
            maxHeap.offer(pile);
        }
        
        // Perform k operations
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            // Get and remove the largest pile
            int largestPile = maxHeap.poll();
            
            // Calculate the new size of the pile after removing half of the stones
            int newPile = largestPile - (largestPile / 2);
            
            // Insert the new pile size back into the heap
            maxHeap.offer(newPile);
        }
        
        // Sum the remaining stones
        int totalStones = 0;
        while (!maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
            totalStones += maxHeap.poll();
        }
        return totalStones;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
1. Building the initial max-heap from `piles` takes \(O(n \log n)\).
2. Each of the `k` operations involves extracting the maximum element and reinserting a modified element into the heap:
   - Extracting the maximum element: \(O(\log n)\)
   - Reinserting a modified element: \(O(\log n)\)
3. Therefore, for `k` operations: \(O(k \log n)\).
4. Summing the remaining elements after heap operations: \(O(n \log n)\).

Thus, the total time complexity is \(O((k + n) \log n)\).

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is mainly dictated by the space required for the heap, which is \(O(n)\).
