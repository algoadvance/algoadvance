[Leetcode 2492. Minimum Score of a Path Between Two Cities](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2492)
## Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer `n` representing `n` cities numbered from `1` to `n`. You are also given a 2D array `roads` where `roads[i] = [a_i, b_i, distance_i]` indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities `a_i` and `b_i` with a distance of `distance_i`.

The minimum score of a path between two cities is defined as the minimum distance of any road in the path.

Return the minimum score of a path between city `1` and city `n`.

Note:
- A path is a sequence of roads connecting two cities.
- It is guaranteed that there is a path between city `1` and city `n`.

## Example
```
Input: n = 4, roads = [[1, 2, 9], [2, 3, 6], [2, 4, 5], [1, 4, 7]]
Output: 5
Explanation: The path from city 1 to city 4 with the minimum score is 1 -> 4, with a score of 7. The path 1 -> 2 -> 4 has a minimum score of 5. Hence, the minimum score is 5.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the same path be counted multiple times?**
   - No, each path is counted once even though there might be multiple ways to traverse it.

2. **Is the graph always connected?**
   - Yes, it is guaranteed that there is a path between city `1` and city `n`.

## Strategy

This is a graph problem which can be solved using techniques like BFS or DFS. We need to find a path from city `1` to city `n` such that the minimum score (defined as the minimum distance on that path) is maximized. The overall strategy can be simplified as follows:

1. **Graph Construction**:
   - Construct the graph as an adjacency list from the given `roads`.

2. **Perform BFS/DFS**:
   - Perform BFS/DFS starting from city `1` to find paths to city `n` while keeping track of the minimum distance in those paths. The goal is to minimize the score along the path.

3. **Maintain Minimum Distance**:
   - Keep updating the minimum score while traversing the paths.

## Code

Below is the Java implementation to solve the problem using BFS:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MinimumScorePath {
    static class Pair {
        int node, distance;
        Pair(int node, int distance) {
            this.node = node;
            this.distance = distance;
        }
    }

    public int minScore(int n, int[][] roads) {
        Map<Integer, List<Pair>> graph = new HashMap<>();
        for (int[] road : roads) {
            graph.computeIfAbsent(road[0], k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(new Pair(road[1], road[2]));
            graph.computeIfAbsent(road[1], k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(new Pair(road[0], road[2]));
        }

        int minScore = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n + 1];

        queue.add(1);
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int current = queue.poll();
            visited[current] = true;

            for (Pair neighbor : graph.get(current)) {
                if (!visited[neighbor.node]) {
                    minScore = Math.min(minScore, neighbor.distance);
                    queue.add(neighbor.node);
                }
            }
        }

        return minScore;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumScorePath solution = new MinimumScorePath();
        int n = 4;
        int[][] roads = { {1, 2, 9}, {2, 3, 6}, {2, 4, 5}, {1, 4, 7} };
        System.out.println(solution.minScore(n, roads));  // Output: 5
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Graph Construction**: \(O(E)\), where \(E\) is the number of roads.
- **BFS/DFS Traversal**: \(O(V + E)\), where \(V\) is the number of cities and \(E\) is the number of roads.

Hence, the overall time complexity is \(O(V + E)\). 

This solution ensures that we check all possible paths and find the minimum score effectively.
