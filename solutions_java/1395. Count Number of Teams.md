[Leetcode 1395. Count Number of Teams](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1395)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `rating` of distinct integers where `rating[i]` represents the rating of the ith soldier.

A team is formed when three soldiers are selected such that:
- The first soldier's rating is less than the second soldier's rating and the second soldier's rating is less than the third soldier's rating (`rating[i] < rating[j] < rating[k]` where `i < j < k`), or
- The first soldier's rating is greater than the second soldier's rating and the second soldier's rating is greater than the third soldier's rating (`rating[i] > rating[j] > rating[k]` where `i < j < k`).

Return the number of teams you can form given the conditions above. Soldiers can be part of multiple teams.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Are the elements in the `rating` array always distinct?
   **A**: Yes, the problem statement specifies that the integers in the `rating` array are distinct.
   
2. **Q**: What is the size range of the `rating` array?
   **A**: The size of the `rating` array will be between 3 and 200.

3. **Q**: Is it expected that the solution should be optimized given that the maximum constraint is 200?
   **A**: Yes, while brute force may be a consideration due to small constraints, an optimal solution is preferred.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need an efficient way to count the number of valid teams. We can use three nested loops to check every combination of three soldiers to see if they form a valid team. However, this could be optimized. Here's a more efficient approach:

1. **Initialize variables**:
   - `n`: the length of the `rating` array.
   - `teams_count`: to keep count of valid teams.

2. **Iterate through the array** using indices i, j, k:
   - For each `j` (middle soldier), count the number of valid `i` (left soldiers) and `k` (right soldiers) that form increasing or decreasing teams.
   - Specifically, for each `j`, check how many elements to the left of `j` are either less than or greater than `rating[j]` and similarly for the right of `j`.

### Code

Here's the solution in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int numTeams(int[] rating) {
        int n = rating.length;
        int teams_count = 0;
        
        for (int j = 1; j < n - 1; j++) {
            int less_left = 0, greater_left = 0;
            int less_right = 0, greater_right = 0;
            
            for (int i = 0; i < j; i++) {
                if (rating[i] < rating[j])
                    less_left++;
                if (rating[i] > rating[j])
                    greater_left++;
            }
            for (int k = j + 1; k < n; k++) {
                if (rating[k] < rating[j])
                    less_right++;
                if (rating[k] > rating[j])
                    greater_right++;
            }
            
            teams_count += less_left * greater_right + greater_left * less_right;
        }
        
        return teams_count;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization and variable declaration**: `O(1)`
- **Nested loops**: 
  - Outer loop through each `j`: `O(n)`
  - Inner loops to count for `i` and `k`:
    - First inner loop (left of `j`): `O(n)` in the worst case.
    - Second inner loop (right of `j`): `O(n)` in worst case.
    
This results in a worst-case time complexity of `O(n^2)` which is efficient given the constraint `n <= 200`.

### Conclusion
This approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of valid teams while iterating through the ratings array. Each step is carefully crafted to ensure that we capture all possible valid teams in an optimal manner.
