[Leetcode 3143. Maximum Points Inside the Square](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3143)
### Problem Statement

Given a list of points in a 2D plane, find a square of fixed size such that the number of points inside the square is maximized. The sides of the square are parallel to the x and y axes.

The function signature is:
```java
public int maxPointsInsideSquare(int[][] points, int sideLength) {
    // your code here
}
```

- `points` is a list of points represented by their coordinates `[x, y]`, given as a 2D array of integers.
- `sideLength` is the side length of the square.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the coordinates of the points always integers?
2. Can the square touch the border of the plane?
3. Are there any constraints on the range or number of points?
4. Can the square be rotated or does it always stay parallel to the x and y axes?

### Strategy

1. **Determine Range**: First, identify the range of x and y coordinates based on the given points.
2. **Sliding Window**: Use a sliding window technique to check different positions of the square:
    - Iterate through all possible positions of the bottom-left corner of the square.
    - For each position, count how many points lie inside the square.
3. **Count Points**: For each square position, use a brute-force approach to count the number of points inside the square.
4. **Optimize**: To improve performance, consider using a more optimized data structure like a 2D prefix sum array for counting points quickly within ranges.

### Code

Here's an implementation of the brute-force approach:

```java
public int maxPointsInsideSquare(int[][] points, int sideLength) {
    int maxCount = 0;
    
    for (int[] point1 : points) {
        for (int[] point2 : points) {
            // Try all possible bottom-left corners of the square
            int x0 = point1[0];
            int y0 = point2[0];
            
            int count = 0;
            
            for (int[] point : points) {
                if (point[0] >= x0 && point[0] <= x0 + sideLength &&
                    point[1] >= y0 && point[1] <= y0 + sideLength) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            
            maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, count);
        }
    }
    
    return maxCount;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Brute Force**: This approach has a time complexity of \(O(n^3)\):
  - Iterate over all pairs of points to determine possible square positions \((x0, y0)\), which takes \(O(n^2)\).
  - For each position, iterating over all points to count how many are inside the square takes \(O(n)\).
  - Hence, the overall time complexity is \(O(n^3)\).

This brute-force solution can be further optimized using better data structures and algorithms, perhaps leveraging spatial partitioning, but as a first-pass solution, this should be sufficient for small inputs. For larger input sizes, more sophisticated algorithms like employing a 2D prefix sum array would be necessary.
