[Leetcode 994. Rotting Oranges](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l994)
### Problem Statement

You are given an m x n grid where each cell can have one of three values:
- `0` representing an empty cell,
- `1` representing a fresh orange, or
- `2` representing a rotten orange.

Every minute, any fresh orange that is 4-directionally adjacent to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return `-1`.

### Example:
**Input:**
```
[[2,1,1],
 [1,1,0],
 [0,1,1]]
```
**Output:** `4`

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can fresh oranges become rotten in the same minute if they are adjacent to rotten oranges? 
   - Yes, fresh oranges can become rotten in the same minute if they are adjacent to rotten oranges.
   
2. Is it guaranteed that there will be at least one fresh or rotten orange in the grid?
   - No, it is not guaranteed; the grid may only contain empty cells.

3. How large can m and n be?
   - The constraints are: 1 <= m, n <= 10.

### Code:
```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public class Solution {
    public int orangesRotting(int[][] grid) {
        if (grid == null || grid.length == 0) return -1;
        
        int rows = grid.length;
        int cols = grid[0].length;
        
        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        int freshOranges = 0;
        
        // Step 1: Initialize the queue with all the current rotten oranges
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 2) {
                    queue.offer(new int[]{i, j});
                } else if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    freshOranges++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // If there are no fresh oranges, return 0 immediately.
        if (freshOranges == 0) return 0;
        
        // Step 2: Process the grid minute by minute
        int minutesElapsed = 0;
        int[][] directions = // use example from above
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty() && freshOranges > 0) {
            int size = queue.size();
            
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                int[] current = queue.poll();
                int x = current[0], y = current[1];
                
                for (int[] dir : directions) {
                    int newX = x + dir[0], newY = y + dir[1];
                    
                    if (newX >= 0 && newX < rows && newY >= 0 && newY < cols && grid[newX][newY] == 1) {
                        grid[newX][newY] = 2;
                        queue.offer(new int[]{newX, newY});
                        freshOranges--;
                    }
                }
            }
            
            minutesElapsed++;
        }
        
        return freshOranges == 0 ? minutesElapsed : -1;
    }
}
```

### Strategy:

1. **Initialization**:
    - Create a queue to keep track of all rotten oranges in the grid. Iterate through the grid and enqueue all positions of rotten oranges (value `2`). Also, count the number of fresh oranges (value `1`).

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
    - Perform a BFS starting from all initial rotten oranges. For each rotten orange, check its 4-directionally adjacent cells (up, down, left, right). If any of these cells contain a fresh orange, they become rotten.
    - Each level of BFS (each iteration over the queue) represents a minute elapsed.

3. **Termination**:
    - Continue the BFS until there are no more fresh oranges, or the queue is empty.
    - If there are no fresh oranges left, return the number of minutes elapsed; otherwise, return `-1` indicating it's impossible to rot all oranges.

### Time Complexity:
- **Initialization**: O(m * n), where m and n are the dimensions of the grid. This involves scanning every cell to initialize the queue and count fresh oranges.
- **BFS Traversal**: O(m * n), as each cell is added to the queue at most once.

Overall, the time complexity is O(m * n). The space complexity is also O(m * n) due to the storage in the queue.
