[Leetcode 1608. Special Array With X Elements Greater Than or Equal X](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1608)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` of non-negative integers. `nums` is considered special if there exists a number `x` such that there are exactly `x` numbers in `nums` that are greater than or equal to `x`. Notice that `x` does not have to be an element in `nums`.

Return `x` if the array is special, otherwise return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size range of the `nums` array?**
   - The array length can vary from `0` to `100`.

2. **What can be the values of elements in `nums`?**
   - Each element in `nums` is a non-negative integer from `0` to `100`.

3. **Can the array be empty?**
   - Yes, the array can be empty. In this case, the output should be `-1`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, you can use the following steps:

1. **Sort the Array:** Sorting helps in counting elements efficiently.
2. **Iterate and Validate:** Iterate from `0` to the length of the array. For each index, check if the condition for special number `x` is satisfied.
3. **Return the Result:** If such a number `x` is found, return it; otherwise, return `-1`.

### Code

Here is the implementation in Java:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class SpecialArray {
    public int specialArray(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int n = nums.length;

        for (int x = 0; x <= n; x++) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int num : nums) {
                if (num >= x) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            if (count == x) {
                return x;
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SpecialArray solution = new SpecialArray();
        int[] nums1 = {3, 5};
        int result1 = solution.specialArray(nums1);
        System.out.println(result1);  // Output: 2

        int[] nums2 = {0, 0};
        int result2 = solution.specialArray(nums2);
        System.out.println(result2);  // Output: -1

        int[] nums3 = {0, 4, 3, 0, 4};
        int result3 = solution.specialArray(nums3);
        System.out.println(result3);  // Output: 3
        
        int[] nums4 = {3,6,7,7,0};
        int result4 = solution.specialArray(nums4);
        System.out.println(result4);  // Output: -1
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting:** The array is sorted initially which takes `O(n log n)` time.
2. **Iteration and Validation:** We iterate over the array to calculate the count, which takes `O(n)` time and is done `O(n)` times in the worst case.

Overall, the time complexity is **O(n log n)** due to the sorting step being the most time-consuming part.
