[Leetcode 1739. Building Boxes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1739)
## Problem Statement

You have a cubic storeroom where the floor is a grid of size `n x n`, and you want to place boxes in the storeroom such that they form a pile. The piles of boxes have a special requirements: 

- Each box must be placed on top of another box or directly on the floor.
- Each box must be stable, which means no box can be overhanging any grid cell which does not contain another box underneath.

You are asked to determine the minimum number of boxes needed to build a pile that reaches exactly `n` levels high.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the boxes be of any size, or should we assume they are all 1x1x1?**
   - The boxes are all 1x1x1 in size.
   
2. **Are we given any constraints on the value of `n`? What are the possible values of `n`?**
   - Let's assume typical constraint ranges might be `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`.

3. **Are all the piles independent, or can they combine to form a structure?**
   - The objective is to find the minimum number of boxes needed to build a structure that reaches exactly `n` levels high. They can combine to form a larger structure.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can take advantage of the fact that the number of boxes needed to reach successive levels forms a kind of triangular number sequence within a cumulative fashion. To build a stable structure, at height `h`, the base area should be a triangular number of `h`.

1. **Generate the minimum number of boxes to reach successive heights**:
   - For height `1`: We need `1` box.
   - For height `2`: We need `1 + 3` = `4` boxes (1 for the first layer, and 1+2 for the second layer)
   - For height `3`: We need `1 + 3 + 6` = `10` boxes (1 for the first layer, 1+2 for the second layer, and 1+2+3 for the third layer)

We can use a greedy approach:
1. Find the cumulative sum to determine a range where `n` falls between two cumulative sums.
2. Use binary search or arithmetic techniques to minimize the boxes needed to achieve exactly `n` levels.

## Code

```java
public class BuildingBoxes {
    public int minimumBoxes(int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        
        long totalBoxes = 0, height = 0, base = 0;
        
        // Total until the height becomes more than n
        while (totalBoxes + base + (height+1)*(height+2)/2 <= n) {
            height++;
            totalBoxes += base;
            base += height;
        }
        
        // Add boxes at the ground level
        while (totalBoxes + (height*(height+1)/2) < n) {
            height++;
            totalBoxes += height*(height+1)/2;
        }
        
        return (int)(totalBoxes);
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BuildingBoxes solver = new BuildingBoxes();
        System.out.println(solver.minimumBoxes(3));  // Example Output: 3
        System.out.println(solver.minimumBoxes(10)); // Example Output: 6
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach can be analyzed based on the while loops:
1. The first loop constructs the basic layers (triangular number sequence) until just below or equal to `n`.
2. The second loop adjusts to exactly meet `n` considering last partial layer adjustments.

Given the nature of triangular number sums and loops for iterative summation:
- The time complexity is approximately `O(h)` where `h` is the height required to consider until `n`, but since each number increases significantly with each iteration, it's typically manageable even for large values.

This setup allows for good computational efficiency given the constraints (typical scenario) posed by the nature of the piling required.
