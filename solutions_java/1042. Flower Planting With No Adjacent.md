[Leetcode 1042. Flower Planting With No Adjacent full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1042)
### Problem Statement

You have `n` gardens, labeled from 1 to `n`, and an array `paths` where `paths[i] = [x, y]` describes a bidirectional path between garden `x` and garden `y`. In each garden, you want to plant one of 4 types of flowers represented by different integers (1, 2, 3, or 4). 

You need to plant flowers in such a way that no two adjacent gardens have the same type of flower. Return any such a valid type assignment as an array answer in which `answer[i]` is the type of flower planted in the `(i+1)`-th garden. It is guaranteed an answer exists.

**Example:**

```text
Input: n = 3, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: [1,2,3]

Input: n = 4, paths = [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: [1,2,1,2]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Does every garden have to be connected to at least one other garden?**
   Not necessarily, some gardens might be isolated.
   
2. **Can we assume that the input paths are valid and do not contain duplicates or self-loops?**
   Yes, we can assume the input is well-formed.

3. **Does the order of the flower types in the answer matter as long as the constraint is satisfied?**
   No, any valid assignment that satisfies the constraints is acceptable.

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation:** Use an adjacency list to represent the garden connections. Each garden will be a node, and each path will be an edge connecting two nodes.
2. **Flower Assignment:** Use a greedy algorithm to assign flower types. Since each garden can have one of 4 types of flowers, pick a flower type that is not used by any of its adjacent gardens.
3. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Construct the adjacency list from the input `paths`.
   - Initialize an array to store the flower types for each garden.
   - For each garden, iterate through its neighbors and choose a flower type that hasn't been used by any neighbor.

### Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class FlowerPlanting {

    public int[] gardenNoAdj(int n, int[][] paths) {
        List<Integer>[] graph = new ArrayList[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        
        // Build the graph
        for (int[] path : paths) {
            graph[path[0] - 1].add(path[1] - 1);
            graph[path[1] - 1].add(path[0] - 1);
        }

        int[] result = new int[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            boolean[] used = new boolean[5]; // Track used flower types by neighbors
            
            for (int neighbor : graph[i]) {
                if (result[neighbor] != 0) {
                    used[result[neighbor]] = true;
                }
            }
            
            for (int flowerType = 1; flowerType <= 4; flowerType++) {
                if (!used[flowerType]) {
                    result[i] = flowerType;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FlowerPlanting solution = new FlowerPlanting();
        int n = 3;
         //int[][] paths = Use example from above
        int[] result = solution.gardenNoAdj(n, paths);
        for (int flowerType : result) {
            System.out.print(flowerType + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Graph Construction:** \(O(n + e)\) where `n` is the number of gardens and `e` is the number of paths.
- **Flower Assignment:** For each garden, checking used flower types and assigning a flower is \(O(1)\) because there are at most 4 neighbors (due to only 4 adjacent flower types).

Overall time complexity is \(O(n + e)\).

This solution ensures that the problem requirements are met by using a greedy approach, guaranteeing that no two adjacent gardens have the same flower type.
