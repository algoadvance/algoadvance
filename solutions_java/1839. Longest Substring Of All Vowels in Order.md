[Leetcode 1839. Longest Substring Of All Vowels in Order](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1839)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `word` consisting of lowercase English letters only. A substring of `word` is considered to be a proper vowel substring if it consists of the five vowels `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, `'u'` in that order (each of these vowels must appear at least once in the substring and the letters must appear in such a way that every vowel must be placed after its previous vowel).

Your task is to determine the length of the longest proper vowel substring of `word`. If no such substring exists, return `0`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What if the input string is empty?
   - **A:** If the input string is empty, the length of the longest proper vowel substring is `0`.

2. **Q:** Are there any special characters or uppercase letters in the input string?
   - **A:** No, the string consists of lowercase English letters only.

3. **Q:** Can there be multiple longest proper vowel substrings?
   - **A:** Yes, but we only need the length of one of the longest substrings.

### Code

```java
public class LongestVowelSubstring {
    public int longestBeautifulSubstring(String word) {
        if (word == null || word.isEmpty()) return 0;
        
        // Vowels in the required order
        String vowels = "aeiou";
        int maxLength = 0, currentLength = 0, vowelIndex = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
            char currentChar = word.charAt(i);
            
            if (vowelIndex > 0 && vowels.charAt(vowelIndex - 1) == currentChar) {
                // If the character is the same as the previous vowel, just increase the length
                currentLength++;
            } else if (vowelIndex < 5 && vowels.charAt(vowelIndex) == currentChar) {
                // If the character matches the required order
                if (vowelIndex == 0 || (i > 0 && word.charAt(i-1) == vowels.charAt(vowelIndex - 1))) {
                    currentLength++;
                } else if (i > 0 && word.charAt(i-1) < currentChar) {
                    // Start new length calculation with the current vowel if in order
                    currentLength = 1;
                }
                if (vowelIndex < 5) {
                    vowelIndex++;
                }
            } else {
                // Reset if character is out of order
                if (currentChar == 'a') {
                    currentLength = 1;
                    vowelIndex = 1;
                } else {
                    currentLength = 0;
                    vowelIndex = 0;
                }
            }
            
            if (vowelIndex == 5) {
                // We encountered all the vowels in order, update maxLength
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength);
            }
        }
        
        return maxLength;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LongestVowelSubstring solution = new LongestVowelSubstring();
        System.out.println(solution.longestBeautifulSubstring("aeiaaioaaaaeiiiiouuuooaauuaeiu"));  // Example test case
        // Further test cases can be added
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:** Set up a string with the vowels in the required order. Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum length found, the current length being tracked, and the index of the vowel we are currently expecting.
2. **Iterate through the string:**
   - Check the current character against the expected order.
   - If the character matches the current expected vowel, increase the current length.
   - Reset and re-calculate if the order is broken or if a different vowel sequence starts.
3. **Check and update the maximum length whenever all vowels in order are found.**
4. **Edge Cases:** Handle cases with an empty string or where the vowels are interrupted.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the length of the input string `word`. We iterate through the string once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we use a constant amount of extra space.
