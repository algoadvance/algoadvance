[Leetcode 2790. Maximum Number of Groups With Increasing Length](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2790)
## Problem Statement

You are given a non-negative integer array `grades` that represents the grades of students in a school. You want to form the maximum number of groups of students such that each group contains at least one student, and the length of each group is strictly greater than the length of the previous group.

Given the array `grades`, return the maximum number of such groups you can form.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: grades = [10, 6, 12, 7, 3, 5]
Output: 3
Explanation:
1. The first group has 1 student: [10]
2. The second group has 2 students: [6, 12]
3. The third group has 3 students: [7, 3, 5]
It can be shown that it is not possible to form more than 3 groups.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the grades all unique?**
   - There is no requirement for the grades to be unique.

2. **What should be done if the array is empty?**
   - If the array is empty, the output should be 0 since no groups can be formed.

3. **Is there any constraint on the size of `grades` array?**
   - Assume `grades.length` is at most \(10^5\).

## Strategy

1. Sort the array `grades`. Sorting helps in managing the increment in group size.
2. Use a greedy strategy to form groups:
   - Initialize variables to keep track of the current group size and the maximum number of groups.
   - Iterate through the sorted `grades` and try to form groups with a strictly increasing size. Keep a count of the students added to the current group.
   - When the current group reaches the required size, start forming the next group with an incremented size.
  
## Time Complexity

- Sorting the array `grades` takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array.
- Forming the groups will take \(O(n)\) time.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

## Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MaxNumberOfGroups {
    public int maxGroups(int[] grades) {
        if (grades == null || grades.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        Arrays.sort(grades);
        
        int groupCount = 0;
        int currentGroupSize = 1;
        int currentGroupMembers = 0;
        
        for (int grade : grades) {
            currentGroupMembers++;
            if (currentGroupMembers == currentGroupSize) {
                groupCount++;
                currentGroupSize++;
                currentGroupMembers = 0;
            }
        }
        
        return groupCount;
    }

    // Example usage
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaxNumberOfGroups sol = new MaxNumberOfGroups();
        int[] grades = {10, 6, 12, 7, 3, 5};
        System.out.println(sol.maxGroups(grades)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

This code sorts the array and then uses a greedy approach to form the maximum number of groups with increasing length.
