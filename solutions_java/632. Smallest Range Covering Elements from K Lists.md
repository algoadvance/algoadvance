[Leetcode 632. Smallest Range Covering Elements from K Lists full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l632)
## Problem Statement

You have `k` lists of sorted integers `nums`. Find the smallest range `[a, b]` that includes at least one number from each of the `k` lists.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - How large can `k` be?
   - What is the maximum length of each list?

2. **Nature of Elements:**
   - Are all the elements in the lists unique?
   - Can the lists contain negative numbers including zero?
   
3. **Output Format:**
   - Should the output be the exact range `[a, b]`, or just the length of the range?

Assuming:
- `k` and length of each list can be up to 500.
- Elements can include negative numbers.
- Output should be the exact range `[a, b]`.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a min-heap (priority queue) to help us efficiently find the smallest range. Here is the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Use a min-heap to keep track of the smallest current elements from each of the `k` lists.
   - Track the maximum value among the current elements from the lists.

2. **Iteration:**
   - Continuously extract the minimum element from the heap.
   - Compute the current range from the minimum element to the maximum element.
   - Update the result if the current range is smaller than the previously found ranges.
   - Move to the next element in the list from which the minimum element was extracted, and insert this next element into the heap.
   - Update the maximum value if the new element is larger than the current maximum value.

3. **Termination:**
   - The process ends when one of the lists is exhausted, as then it is impossible to cover all the lists anymore.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class SmallestRange {

    public int[] smallestRange(List<List<Integer>> nums) {
        // Min-heap to manage the current smallest elements from each list.
        PriorityQueue<Element> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(e -> e.value));
        
        // To track the maximum element in the heap.
        int currentMax = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        
        // Initial population of the heap with the first element from each list.
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            int value = nums.get(i).get(0);
            minHeap.offer(new Element(value, i, 0));
            currentMax = Math.max(currentMax, value);
        }
        
        // Initialize the smallest range as the largest possible range.
        int rangeStart = 0, rangeEnd = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        // Process elements from the heap.
        while (true) {
            Element currentElement = minHeap.poll();
            int currentMin = currentElement.value;

            // Update the range if a smaller range is found.
            if (currentMax - currentMin < rangeEnd - rangeStart) {
                rangeStart = currentMin;
                rangeEnd = currentMax;
            }
            
            // If there are more elements in the current list, add the next element to the heap.
            if (currentElement.col + 1 < nums.get(currentElement.row).size()) {
                int nextValue = nums.get(currentElement.row).get(currentElement.col + 1);
                minHeap.offer(new Element(nextValue, currentElement.row, currentElement.col + 1));
                currentMax = Math.max(currentMax, nextValue);
            } else {
                // If any list is exhausted, we terminate.
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return new int[]{rangeStart, rangeEnd};
    }

    // Helper class to encapsulate the element along with its origin list and column index.
    private static class Element {
        int value;
        int row;
        int col;
        
        public Element(int value, int row, int col) {
            this.value = value;
            this.row = row;
            this.col = col;
        }
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The overall time complexity of the solution can be broken down as follows:
- Initial heap construction: \(O(k \log k)\)
- Each insertion and extraction operation from the heap: \(O(\log k)\)
- Since each list contributes 'n' elements, and we do these operations for all elements,
  the total complexity for \(k\) lists of size \(n\) would be: \(O(nk \log k)\).

Given that \(k, n \leq 500\), this complexity should be manageable for the problem constraints.
