[Leetcode 3212. Count Submatrices With Equal Frequency of X and Y](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3212)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D grid `grid` of dimensions `m x n`, which contains integers `X` and `Y`. You need to find the number of submatrices (smaller rectangular matrices which are part of the given matrix) where the frequency of `X` is equal to the frequency of `Y`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the possible values of grid elements?**
   - The grid elements are integers with possible values being `X` or `Y`.

2. **What should be done if there are no `X` and `Y` in the grid?**
   - In such cases, the count should be zero as there would be no submatrices containing both `X` and `Y`.

3. **How large can the grid be?**
   - The constraints in the grid size will help define the optimal approach. For example, if the grid size (m, n) is large, we need to consider an optimal approach to avoid time complexity issues.

4. **Are submatrices with no X and Y or only one out of X or Y considered valid?**
    - No, only submatrices with equal numbers of Xs and Ys should be considered.

### Strategy

1. **Prefix Sum Arrays:** 
   - Utilize prefix sum arrays to keep track of the count of `X` and `Y` in a fast retrievable manner.
   
2. **Brute Force Limitation:**
   - A na√Øve brute force approach would generate all possible submatrices and then count the occurrences of `X` and `Y` which will be very inefficient \(O((m \times n)^2)\).

3. **Efficient Submatrix Enumeration:**
   - Use histogram-like techniques to convert the 2D problem to a 1D sum problem and then apply a sliding window or hashmap to count the equal number occurrences.

### Code 

Here is an optimized Java solution:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int countSubmatricesWithEqualFrequency(int[][] grid, int X, int Y) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        int count = 0;
        
        // Iterate over all pairs of rows
        for (int top = 0; top < m; top++) {
            int[] diffCount = new int[n];
            for (int bottom = top; bottom < m; bottom++) {
                for (int col = 0; col < n; col++) {
                    if (grid[bottom][col] == X) {
                        diffCount[col]++;
                    } else if (grid[bottom][col] == Y) {
                        diffCount[col]--;
                    }
                }
                
                // Use hash map to find subarrays with (X - Y) difference zero
                count += countEqualZero(diffCount);
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
    
    private int countEqualZero(int[] arr) {
        int count = 0;
        int sum = 0;
        Map<Integer, Integer> prefixSum = new HashMap<>();
        prefixSum.put(0, 1); // base condition: subarray starting from index 0
        
        for (int num : arr) {
            sum += num;
            count += prefixSum.getOrDefault(sum, 0);
            prefixSum.put(sum, prefixSum.getOrDefault(sum, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Outer loops over the rows:** O(m^2)
- **Inner loop over the columns:** O(n)
- **Hash Map Operations:** O(n) on average due to hashing

Overall, the time complexity of this solution is **O(m^2 * n)**, which should be efficient enough for reasonably sized grids.

This solution transforms the 2D grid problem into a 1D subarray sum problem for each pair of rows, enabling efficient counting by accumulating differences and using a hashmap to quickly find the subarrays with the required conditions.
