[Leetcode 438. Find All Anagrams in a String full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l438)
## Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `p`, return an array of all the start indices of `p`'s anagrams in `s`. You may return the answer in any order.

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "cbaebabacd", p = "abc"
Output: [0, 6]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "abab", p = "ab"
Output: [0, 1, 2]
Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 1 is "ba", which is an anagram of "ab".
The substring with start index = 2 is "ab", which is an anagram of "ab".
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length, p.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `s` and `p` consist of lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `s` and `p` be empty?**
   - No, given the constraints both `s` and `p` will have at least one character.

2. **Are special characters or spaces allowed in `s` or `p`?**
   - No, the strings consist only of lowercase English letters.

3. **Can `s` be smaller than `p`?**
   - No, itâ€™s specified that `s` and `p` both have lengths between 1 and 30000, and it's implicitly given that we will only perform operations when looking for anagrams where it makes sense (i.e., `s.length` should be greater or equal to`p.length`).

## Strategy

To find all anagrams of the string `p` in `s`, we'll leverage a sliding window technique with a frequency counter. The idea is to maintain a window of length equal to `p` and slide it across `s`, updating the frequency counts of characters and checking if they match the character frequency of `p`.

1. **Initialize Frequency Arrays:**
   - Create frequency arrays (or hashmaps) for `p` and the current window in `s`.

2. **Setup Initial Window:**
   - Populate the frequency array for the initial window of length `p` from the start of `s`.

3. **Slide the Window:**
   - Slide the window one character at a time.
   - Update the frequency arrays by removing the count of the character that's left behind and adding the new character that comes into the window.

4. **Check for Anagrams:**
   - After each slide, compare the frequency arrays: if they are equal, the current starting index is an anagram's starting point.

5. **Return Indices:**
   - Collect and return all starting indices where the frequency arrays matched.

## Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class AnagramFinder {
    public List<Integer> findAnagrams(String s, String p) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        if(s.length() < p.length()) return result;
        
        int[] pCount = new int[26];
        int[] sCount = new int[26];
        
        // Count frequency of each character in p
        for(char ch : p.toCharArray()) {
            pCount[ch - 'a']++;
        }
        
        // Populate the initial window
        for(int i = 0; i < p.length(); i++) {
            sCount[s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        }
        
        // Check if initial window matches
        if(Arrays.equals(sCount, pCount)) {
            result.add(0);
        }
        
        // Slide the window across `s`
        for(int i = p.length(); i < s.length(); i++) {
            // add new character to the window
            sCount[s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
            // remove the old character from the window
            sCount[s.charAt(i - p.length()) - 'a']--;
            
            // check if matching
            if(Arrays.equals(sCount, pCount)) {
                result.add(i - p.length() + 1);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization of frequency counters:** `O(p.length)`
- **Sliding window through the string:** `O((s.length - p.length + 1) * 26)`, since in the worst case we compare two frequency arrays of size 26 for each window.
- **Total Time Complexity:** `O(s.length * 26)`, which simplifies to `O(26 * s.length)`. Since 26 is a constant (`O(1)`), the final complexity is essentially `O(s.length)`.

This approach efficiently finds all starting indices of anagrams of `p` in `s` by using sliding window and constant-time character frequency comparison.
