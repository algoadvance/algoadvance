[Leetcode 667. Beautiful Arrangement II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l667)
## Problem Statement

Given two integers `n` and `k`, you need to construct a permutation of the integers from `1` to `n` such that there are exactly `k` distinct absolute differences between consecutive elements.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints**:
   - Is it guaranteed that a valid permutation exists for any `n` and `k` satisfying 1 â‰¤ `k` < `n`?
     - Yes, it's guaranteed by the problem statement.
   - Can `n` be a large value like 10^6, and what is the expected complexity?
     - The constraints typically imply that `n` can be large, but an efficient solution is expected to handle this.

2. **Output Format**:
   - The function should return a list of integers representing the permutation.
   - Is there a specific format required for the output permutation, or any permutation with `k` distinct differences is acceptable?
     - Any permutation that satisfies the condition is acceptable.

## Strategy

1. **Initial Thoughts**:
   - We need a permutation such that exactly `k` distinct absolute differences exist.
   - We can start with a simple increasing permutation from `1` to `n`.

2. **Key Insight**:
   - The idea is to construct the permutation in such a way that the differences are controlled.
   - An effective strategy is to alternate between the smallest and largest remaining elements to ensure distinct differences initially, and then continue with a simple increase.

3. **Construction Plan**:
   - Start from the smallest and largest remaining numbers.
   - Alternate between the smallest (left) and largest (right) until we create `k` distinct differences.
   - After achieving `k` distinct differences, fill the remaining part of the permutation straightforwardly.

## Code

Let's implement this strategy in the code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class BeautifulArrangementII {
    public int[] constructArray(int n, int k) {
        int[] result = new int[n];
        int left = 1, right = n;
        boolean flag = true;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if (flag) {
                result[i] = left++;
            } else {
                result[i] = right--;
            }
            flag = !flag;
        }
        
        if (k % 2 == 0) {
            for (int i = k; i < n; i++) {
                result[i] = left++;
            }
        } else {
            for (int i = k; i < n; i++) {
                result[i] = right--;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BeautifulArrangementII solution = new BeautifulArrangementII();
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(solution.constructArray(3, 1))); // [1, 2, 3]
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(solution.constructArray(3, 2))); // [1, 3, 2] or [2, 1, 3] etc.
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - We iterate through the array slightly more than once to construct it.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) (excluding the space required for the output array)
  - We use only a constant amount of extra space for variables apart from the output array.
