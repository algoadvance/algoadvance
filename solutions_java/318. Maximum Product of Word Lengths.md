[Leetcode 318. Maximum Product of Word Lengths](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l318)
### Problem Statement

Given a string array `words`, return the maximum value of `length(word[i]) * length(word[j])` where the two words do not share common letters. If no such two words exist, return 0.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the maximum length of the array `words` and the maximum length of each word?
   - Usually, we expect `words.length` to be up to `10^3` and the length of each word up to `10^3`, but we should confirm.
   
2. **Character Set**: Are the words composed of only lowercase English letters?
   - Assuming from typical constraints, yes.

3. **Output**: Are we guaranteed that there will be at least two words in the array?
   - If not, we should handle cases where there are fewer than two words by directly returning 0.

### Strategy

1. **Bitmask Representation**: 
   - Each word can be represented by a bitmask with 26 bits, where each bit corresponds to a character 'a' to 'z'. For example, if a word contains 'a', 'b', and 'c', then its bitmask will have the first three bits set (i.e., `000...0111`).
   
2. **Store Lengths and Bitmasks**: 
   - We will create an array of the same length as `words` where each element contains the bitmask of the word and its length.
   
3. **Check Pairwise**: 
   - Iterate over all pairs of words, checking if their bitmasks do not overlap. If not overlapping, calculate the product of their lengths and keep track of the maximum product.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int maxProduct(String[] words) {
        if (words.length < 2) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int n = words.length;
        int[] masks = new int[n];
        int[] lengths = new int[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int bitmask = 0;
            for (char c : words[i].toCharArray()) {
                bitmask |= (1 << (c - 'a'));
            }
            masks[i] = bitmask;
            lengths[i] = words[i].length();
        }
        
        int maxProduct = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if ((masks[i] & masks[j]) == 0) {
                    maxProduct = Math.max(maxProduct, lengths[i] * lengths[j]);
                }
            }
        }

        return maxProduct;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Bitmask Generation**: O(N * L), where N is the number of words and L is the average length of the words.
- **Pairwise Checking**: O(N^2).
  
Thus, the total time complexity is O(N * L + N^2).

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient given usual constraints, but keep in mind that for extremely large inputs, the quadratic part (N^2) might become a bottleneck.
