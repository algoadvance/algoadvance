[Leetcode 2918. Minimum Equal Sum of Two Arrays After Replacing Zeros](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2918)
### Problem Statement

Given two integer arrays `A` and `B` of the same length, we can replace any zeros in both arrays with any positive integer. After such replacements, we aim to minimize the absolute difference between the sums of the two arrays.

Write a function `minEqualSum` that:
- Accepts two integer arrays `A` and `B`
- Returns the minimum absolute difference between the sums of `A` and `B` after optimally replacing the zeros.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can both arrays have different lengths?**
   - No, both arrays will have the same length.

2. **Can the arrays be empty?**
   - No, the arrays are non-empty and have the same length.

3. **What should be the value range for replacements?**
   - Any positive integer.

4. **Can arrays have no zeros?**
   - Yes, they can.

### Strategy

1. Calculate the initial sums of `A` and `B`.
2. Determine the absolute difference `diff` between the sums of the two arrays.
3. If `diff` is already zero, return 0 since no replacements are necessary.
4. Identify if minimising the absolute difference involves replacing zeroes in
   - A to decrease its sum or,
   - B to increase its sum or,
   - vice versa.
5. When there are zeros, optimally choose replacements to approach equalized sums:
   - Prioritize adjustments reducing the highest contributors to `diff` first.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minEqualSum(int[] A, int[] B) {
        int sumA = 0, sumB = 0;
        for (int num : A) {
            sumA += num;
        }
        for (int num : B) {
            sumB += num;
        }
        
        int diff = Math.abs(sumA - sumB);
        
        if (diff == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        if (sumA > sumB) {
            return adjustZeros(A, B, diff);
        } else {
            return adjustZeros(B, A, diff);
        }
    }
    
    private int adjustZeros(int[] largerSumArray, int[] smallerSumArray, int diff) {
        for (int i = 0; i < largerSumArray.length; i++) {
            if (largerSumArray[i] == 0) {
                largerSumArray[i] = 1;
                diff -= 1;
            }
            if (smallerSumArray[i] == 0) {
                smallerSumArray[i] = diff;
                diff -= diff;
            }
            if (diff <= 0) {
                return 0;
            }
        }
        return diff;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] A = {0, 2, 3};
        int[] B = {1, 0, 4};
        System.out.println(sol.minEqualSum(A, B)); // Output should be 0
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initial sum computation**: O(n)
- **Adjustment loop**: O(n)

Overall, the solution has a time complexity of O(n).

### Explanation:

- The program first computes the total sums of arrays `A` and `B`.
- If the difference `diff` between the sums is zero, it returns 0 immediately.
- Otherwise, it determines which array initially has the larger sum.
- It then minimizes the absolute difference `diff` by replacing zeros in the larger and smaller arrays accordingly.
