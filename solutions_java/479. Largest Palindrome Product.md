[Leetcode 479. Largest Palindrome Product](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l479)
### Problem Statement

The problem is to find the largest palindrome made from the product of two `n`-digit numbers. Since the output could be very large, return the answer modulo 1337.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of `n`:** What are the possible values for `n`? Is it safe to assume `n` will be an integer between 1 and 8 (as constraints for this problem typically go)?
2. **Efficiency Constraints:** Are there any specific constraints on time or space complexity, or should we strive for the most optimal solution?
3. **Output Requirement:** Is the output required to be a specific format or just the integer value of the palindrome product modulo 1337?

Let's proceed under the assumption that `n` will be an integer between 1 and 8, and we aim for an efficient solution.

### Strategy

1. **Define Range:** For `n`-digit numbers, we need to define the range:
   - The maximum `n`-digit number is `max = (int) Math.pow(10, n) - 1`.
   - The minimum `n`-digit number is `min = (int) Math.pow(10, n-1)`.

2. **Find Largest Palindrome:**
   - Iterate through potential products of two `n`-digit numbers from largest to smallest.
   - Check if the product is a palindrome.
   - Track the largest palindrome found.

3. **Check Palindrome:** Implement a helper function to determine if a number is a palindrome.

4. **Modulo Operation:** Apply modulo `1337` at the end to return the required result.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    // Helper function to check if a number is a palindrome
    private boolean isPalindrome(int num) {
        String str = Integer.toString(num);
        int left = 0;
        int right = str.length() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            if (str.charAt(left) != str.charAt(right)) {
                return false;
            }
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        return true;
    }

    public int largestPalindrome(int n) {
        // Define the bounds of n-digit numbers
        int max = (int) Math.pow(10, n) - 1;
        int min = (int) Math.pow(10, n - 1);

        // Track the largest palindrome found
        int largestPalindrome = 0;

        // Iterate from the largest n-digit number downwards
        for (int i = max; i >= min; i--) {
            for (int j = i; j >= min; j--) {
                int product = i * j;
                if (product <= largestPalindrome) {
                    break; // All further products will be smaller
                }
                if (isPalindrome(product)) {
                    largestPalindrome = product; // Update largest palindrome
                }
            }
        }

        return largestPalindrome % 1337;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int n = 2; // Example input
        System.out.println(solution.largestPalindrome(n)); // Example output
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Outer Loop:** Runs from `max` to `min`, total `10^n - 10^(n-1)` iterations, approximated as `10^n - 10^(n-1) â‰ˆ 10^n`.
- **Inner Loop:** Similar range, so approximately `10^n`.
- **Palindrome Check:** Takes `O(d)` where `d` is the number of digits in the product. The maximum number of digits for the product of two `n`-digit numbers is `2 * n`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is roughly `O((10^n)^2 * n)` or approximated as `O(10^(2n) * n)`.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is primarily determined by the space used for variables and storage. Since we're not using any additional substantial data structures, it's O(1).

This algorithm efficiently finds the largest palindrome product of two `n`-digit numbers and returns it modulo 1337 as required.
