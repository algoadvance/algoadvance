[Leetcode 3113. Find the Number of Subarrays Where Boundary Elements Are Maximum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3113)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums`. A subarray is defined to be an array of consecutive integers. We need to find out the number of subarrays such that the maximum element in the subarray is one of the boundary elements (either the first or the last element of the subarray).

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of Elements**: What is the range of numerical values in the `nums` array?
2. **Array Length**: What is the maximum length of the `nums` array?
3. **Constraints**: Are there any specific constraints we should keep in mind (e.g., can elements be negative, duplicate values, etc.)?

Assuming a general case based on typical constraints: 1 ≤ `nums.length` ≤ 10^5 and -10^9 ≤ `nums[i]` ≤ 10^9.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to:
1. **Iterate through all possible subarrays** and count the number of valid subarrays where the boundary elements are the maximum in that subarray.

A naive approach would involve generating all possible subarrays and checking for each, which would be too slow given the possible array length (`O(n^3)`). Therefore, a more efficient approach is necessary.

#### Efficient Approach:

Dynamic Programming or precomputation can help in reducing the time complexity:
1. **Identify valid subarrays** efficiently by leveraging properties of the array.
2. For each element in the array, determine the number of valid subarrays where this element is the maximum and the element is on the boundary.

To achieve better performance:
- **Prefix and Suffix Arrays**: Create arrays that hold the maximum values up to each point, and from each point to the end respectively, and use these for range querying the maximum efficiently.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int countBoundaryMaximumSubarrays(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        
        // Total number of valid subarrays
        int count = 0;

        // Compute prefix maximum
        int[] prefixMax = new int[n];
        prefixMax[0] = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            prefixMax[i] = Math.max(prefixMax[i - 1], nums[i]);
        }

        // Compute suffix maximum
        int[] suffixMax = new int[n];
        suffixMax[n - 1] = nums[n - 1];
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            suffixMax[i] = Math.max(suffixMax[i + 1], nums[i]);
        }

        // Iterate over possible subarrays
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Check subarrays ending at i
            for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
                if (nums[j] == prefixMax[i] || nums[i] == suffixMax[j]) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }

        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {1, 3, 2, 4, 6};
        System.out.println(sol.countBoundaryMaximumSubarrays(nums)); // Example usage
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Building prefix and suffix maximum arrays: `O(n)`
- Checking subarrays: `O(n^2)`

While the worst-case time complexity here is `O(n^2)`, it improves significantly when quick lookups for maximum values are available and if optimizations to skip unnecessary comparisons are possible based on the problem constraints. For larger input sizes, further improvements may involve more sophisticated range query structures like Segment Trees or Fenwick Trees, depending on the typical constraints and required performance.
