[Leetcode 2293. Min Max Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2293)
## Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` whose length is a power of 2.

Apply the following algorithm repeatedly until there is only one element remaining:

1. Let `n` be the length of `nums`. If `n == 1`, end the process. Otherwise, create a new 0-indexed integer array `newNums` of length `n / 2`.
2. For every even index `i` where `0 <= i < n / 2`, assign the value of `newNums[i]` as `min(nums[2 * i], nums[2 * i + 1])`.
3. For every odd index `i` where `0 <= i < n / 2`, assign the value of `newNums[i]` as `max(nums[2 * i], nums[2 * i + 1])`.
4. Replace the array `nums` with `newNums`.
5. Repeat the entire process starting from step 1.

Return the last number that remains in `nums`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What is the length range of the input array `nums`?
   **A:** The length of the array will always be a power of 2, and within a reasonable range for typical array operations.
2. **Q:** Can the elements of `nums` be negative?
   **A:** Yes, the elements of `nums` can be any integers, both negative and positive.
3. **Q:** When constructing `newNums`, how should we handle an element if `i` is neither even nor odd?
   **A:** Each index `i` will always be either even or odd by definition of integers.

## Strategy
1. **Base Case:** If the length of `nums` is 1, return `nums[0]`.
2. Iterate through the array in steps of 2 to form the `newNums` array.
   - For every even index in `newNums`, take the minimum of the corresponding two elements from `nums`.
   - For every odd index in `newNums`, take the maximum of the corresponding two elements from `nums`.
3. Replace `nums` with `newNums` and repeat until `nums` has only one element.

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int minMaxGame(int[] nums) {
        while (nums.length > 1) {
            int n = nums.length;
            int[] newNums = new int[n / 2];
            for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
                if (i % 2 == 0) {
                    newNums[i] = Math.min(nums[2 * i], nums[2 * i + 1]);
                } else {
                    newNums[i] = Math.max(nums[2 * i], nums[2 * i + 1]);
                }
            }
            nums = newNums;
        }
        return nums[0];
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where `n` is the length of the initial `nums` array:
- Each iteration halves the size of the array.
- There are O(log n) iterations since the length of the array is halved each time.
- The amount of work done in each iteration is proportional to the size of the array being halved.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n) due to the sum of the series in the worst case.
