[Leetcode 1254. Number of Closed Islands](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1254)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid` where `0` represents land and `1` represents water.

An island is a maximal 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical) connected group of `0`s and a closed island is an island totally (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by `1`s.

Return the number of closed islands.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for `m` and `n`?**
   - Typically, the constraints will be provided. For most problems, `1 <= m, n <= 1000` is common.
2. **Can I modify the input `grid`?**
   - Usually, modifying the input `grid` in-place is acceptable unless stated otherwise.
3. **Are diagonally connected `0`s considered connected?**
   - No, only 4-directionally (horizontal and vertical) connected `0`s are considered part of the same island.

### Strategy

1. **Flood Fill Algorithm**: Use DFS to mark all connected `0`s from a starting point.
2. **Boundary Check**: A closed island should be checked to ensure none of its `0`s are on the boundary, they should be fully enclosed by `1`s.
3. **Iterate**: Iterate through each cell of the grid. When we find an unvisited land cell (`0`), initiate a DFS/BFS to explore the entire island and check if it is a closed island.
4. **Boundary Flood Fill**: Before we start counting closed islands, we can use a flood-fill algorithm to mark all lands connected to the boundary as visited. This ensures that any land connected to the boundary doesn't get falsely counted as closed.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {

    public int closedIsland(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;

        // Helper function to perform DFS
        void dfs(int x, int y) {
            // If out of bounds or not land, return
            if (x < 0 || y < 0 || x >= m || y >= n || grid[x][y] == 1) {
                return;
            }
            // Mark the cell as visited (change land to water)
            grid[x][y] = 1;
            // Visit all 4 adjacent cells
            dfs(x + 1, y);
            dfs(x - 1, y);
            dfs(x, y + 1);
            dfs(x, y - 1);
        }

        // First, flood-fill all lands connected to the boundary to avoid counting them
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            if (grid[i][0] == 0) {
                dfs(i, 0);
            }
            if (grid[i][n-1] == 0) {
                dfs(i, n-1);
            }
        }
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[0][j] == 0) {
                dfs(0, j);
            }
            if (grid[m-1][j] == 0) {
                dfs(m-1, j);
            }
        }

        // Now count all closed islands
        int closedIslands = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 0) {
                    closedIslands++;
                    dfs(i, j);
                }
            }
        }

        return closedIslands;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: 
  - The DFS function will visit each cell at most once, thus the time complexity is `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.
  
- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is also `O(m * n)` in the worst case due to the DFS recursion stack (if done recursively) or the queue (if done iteratively using BFS).
