[Leetcode 1603. Design Parking System full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1603)
### Problem Statement

You are asked to design a parking system for a parking lot. The parking system has three kinds of parking spaces: big, medium, and small, with a fixed number of slots for each size.

Implement the `ParkingSystem` class:
- `ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small)` Initializes the object of the `ParkingSystem` class. The number of slots for each parking space are given as parameters.
- `boolean addCar(int carType)` Checks whether there is a parking space of `carType` for the car that wants to get into the parking lot. `carType` can be one of three values: 1 (big car), 2 (medium car), or 3 (small car). A car can only park in a parking space of its `carType`. If there is no space available, return `false`, otherwise park the car and return `true`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the total numbers of parking slots for each car type fixed and provided at the initialization?**
   - Yes.
   
2. **Should the solution handle concurrent car parking requests?**
   - No, concurrent requests are not in the scope of this problem.

3. **Are there any constraints on the values that can be passed for big, medium, and small slots?**
   - Yes, constraints are provided in the problem statement:
     - `0 <= big, medium, small <= 1000`
     - `carType` is an integer with values 1, 2, or 3.

### Strategy

We will store the remaining number of slots for each car type using an array or instance variables. When a car arrives with a specific `carType`, we will check if there is a slot available in the corresponding category:
- Decrease the corresponding slot count if a slot is available and return `true`.
- Return `false` if no slot is available for that car type.

### Code

```java
class ParkingSystem {
    
    private int[] slots;
    
    public ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small) {
        slots = new int[4]; // There are three types, use index 1, 2, 3
        slots[1] = big;
        slots[2] = medium;
        slots[3] = small;
    }
    
    public boolean addCar(int carType) {
        if (slots[carType] > 0) {
            slots[carType]--;
            return true;
        } else {
            return false;
        }
    }
}

// Example Usage
// ParkingSystem obj = new ParkingSystem(big, medium, small);
// boolean param_1 = obj.addCar(carType);

```

### Time Complexity

- Initialization: `O(1)` since we're just storing three integer values.
- `addCar`: `O(1)` since checking the availability and updating the slot count is done in constant time.

This design ensures the solution is efficient while being simple and straightforward to implement.
