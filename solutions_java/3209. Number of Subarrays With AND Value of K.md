[Leetcode 3209. Number of Subarrays With AND Value of K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3209)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `arr` and an integer `K`. A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array. Return the number of subarrays where the bitwise AND of all the elements in the subarray is equal to `K`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints:**
   - What is the size range of the array? 
   - What are the possible values for the array elements and `K`?
   - Are there any negative numbers in the array?

2. **Output:**
   - Should I return the count of such subarrays or the subarrays themselves?

3. **Examples:**
   - Can you provide a basic example with expected output?

## Strategy

Given the constraints, we can utilize a sliding window approach or a two-pointer technique to find all the subarrays with a bitwise AND equal to `K`. Here are the steps:

1. Iterate through each possible starting index of the subarray.
2. For each starting index, expand to the right to find subarrays bitwise ANDing up to `K`.
3. Stop expanding when the bitwise AND goes below `K` because adding more numbers will only decrease the value.

### Key Operations:
- **Bitwise AND (`&`)**: This operation will be frequently used as it's crucial for the problem.

### Steps:
1. Initialize a variable to count valid subarrays.
2. Use nested loops where the outer loop sets the starting point and the inner loop expands the subarray.
3. Keep track of the bitwise AND of the current subarray.
4. If it becomes equal to `K`, increase the count.
5. If it becomes less than `K`, break out of the inner loop because subsequent operations won't restore it to `K`.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int subarraysWithANDValueK(int[] arr, int K) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int currentAND = arr[i];
            
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                currentAND &= arr[j];
                
                if (currentAND == K) {
                    count++;
                } else if (currentAND < K) {
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Outer Loop**: Iterates `n` times.
- **Inner Loop**: In the worst-case scenario, it can iterate up to `n` times for every `i`.
- **Bitwise AND Operations**: Performed `O(n^2)` times in total.

Thus, the time complexity is **O(n^2)**, where `n` is the length of the input array.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is **O(1)** since we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This should cover the necessary points to solve the problem efficiently within the provided constraints.
