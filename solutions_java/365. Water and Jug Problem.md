[Leetcode 365. Water and Jug Problem](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l365)
### Problem Statement:
You are given two jugs with capacities `jug1Capacity` and `jug2Capacity` liters. There is an infinite amount of water supply available. Determine whether it is possible to measure exactly `targetCapacity` liters using these two jugs.

The operations you can perform are:
1. Fill any of the jugs completely with water.
2. Empty any of the jugs.
3. Pour water from one jug into another until the other jug is completely full, or the first jug itself is empty.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can `jug1Capacity`, `jug2Capacity`, or `targetCapacity` be negative?**
   - No, all inputs are non-negative integers.

2. **What happens if `targetCapacity` is 0?**
   - If `targetCapacity` is 0, you can always measure it by having both jugs empty.

3. **Can `targetCapacity` be greater than the sum of both jugs?**
   - No, if `targetCapacity` is greater than `jug1Capacity + jug2Capacity`, it is not possible to measure.

### Strategy:
To determine if the target capacity can be measured using the two jugs and the allowed operations, the problem can be translated into a number theory problem. Specifically, it connects to the mathematical concept of the BÃ©zout's identity, which states that for any two integers \(a\) and \(b\), the greatest common divisor \(d\) of \(a\) and \(b\) can be expressed as \(ax + by = d\) for some integers \(x\) and \(y\). Using this identity, it is possible to measure the exact capacity \(z\) if and only if \(z\) is a multiple of the greatest common divisor of \(a\) and \(b\), and \(z\) is less than or equal to \(a + b\).

Formally, given jug capacities `x` and `y`, and target `z`:
1. If \(z > x + y\), return false.
2. If \(z \% gcd(x, y) == 0\), return true; otherwise, return false.

### Code:
Let's translate this strategy into Java code:

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean canMeasureWater(int jug1Capacity, int jug2Capacity, int targetCapacity) {
        // Base case: If the required water is more than the sum of the two jugs, it's impossible
        if (targetCapacity > jug1Capacity + jug2Capacity) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // Base case: If the targetCapacity is zero, it's always possible
        if (targetCapacity == 0) {
            return true;
        }
        
        // Using the GCD approach
        return targetCapacity % gcd(jug1Capacity, jug2Capacity) == 0;
    }

    // Helper method to calculate gcd
    private int gcd(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            int temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Calculating GCD**: The Euclidean method for computing the greatest common divisor takes \(O(\log(\min(a, b)))\).
- **Overall complexity**: The check `targetCapacity % gcd() == 0` is an \(O(1)\) operation. Therefore, the overall time complexity is dominated by the GCD computation, making it \(O(\log(\min(\text{jug1Capacity}, \text{jug2Capacity})))\).
