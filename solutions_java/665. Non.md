### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` with `n` elements. A subarray of `nums` is called good if its length is at least `2` and its elements are non-decreasing. Return the length of the shortest good subarray of `nums`. If no such subarray exists, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What constitutes a non-decreasing array?**
   A subarray is non-decreasing if for any two indices `i` and `j` within the subarray where `i < j`, `nums[i] <= nums[j]`.

2. **What is the minimal and maximal length for the input array `nums`?**
   The input will adhere to the constraint `n >= 1`.

3. **What should be returned if the input array has only one element?**
   Return `-1` since a subarray of length `1` cannot be considered.

4. **Are there any constraints on the elements of `nums`?**
   Elements of `nums` can be any integer within the bounds of typical integer ranges.

### Strategy

1. Iterate over the array, maintaining two pointers `i` and `j` where `i` denotes the start of a potential subarray and `j` scans the elements ahead to find the longest non-decreasing sequence starting from `i`.

2. Whenever a non-decreasing condition is broken (`nums[j] < nums[j-1]`), calculate the length of the subarray from `i` to `j-1`. Update the minimum length if this subarray meets the criteria of having at least 2 elements.

3. Continue this process until the end of the array is reached. 

4. If no valid subarray is found by the end of the iteration, return `-1`.

The approach ensures we find the shortest non-decreasing subarray efficiently using a single pass over the array.

### Code

```java
public int shortestNonDecreasingSubarray(int[] nums) {
    int n = nums.length;
    if (n < 2) return -1; // No subarray can exist in this case.

    int minLength = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    int i = 0;

    // Iterate through the array.
    while (i < n) {
        int j = i + 1;
        // Find the end of a non-decreasing subarray.
        while (j < n && nums[j] >= nums[j - 1]) {
            j++;
        }
        // Calculate the length of the subarray.
        int length = j - i;
        if (length >= 2) {
            minLength = Math.min(minLength, length);
        }
        i = j; // Move to the next starting point.
    }

    return (minLength == Integer.MAX_VALUE) ? -1 : minLength;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) - The array is traversed only once with the increment of `i` and `j`.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) - Only a few extra variables are used regardless of the input size.
