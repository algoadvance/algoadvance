[Leetcode 2386. Find the K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2386)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You need to determine the k-th largest sum of a non-empty subsequence of the array `nums`.

- A **subsequence** of an array is a sequence that can be derived by deleting some or none of the elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
- The **sum** of the subsequence is the total sum of its elements.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of Values**: 
    - What are the constraints on the values within the array `nums`?
    - What is the range of `k`?
2. **Duplicates and Order**:
    - Can the array `nums` contain duplicate values?
    - Should the sums be unique when considering the k-th sum?

### Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= k <= min(2000, 2^n)`

### Strategy
1. **Priority Queue**: Utilize a max heap (priority queue) to keep track of the largest k sums.
2. **Iterate through Combinations**: Since directly enumerating all subsequences would be computationally impractical due to the large number of potential subsequences (exponential in terms of `nums.length`), we need a more efficient method like dynamic programming.
3. **Dynamic Programming**: Use a dynamic programming approach to build sums iteratively using a max heap to efficiently manage the largest k sums.

### Code
Here is a solution that efficiently finds the k-th largest sum of a non-empty subsequence.

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;
import java.util.Collections;

public class KSum {
    public long kSum(int[] nums, int k) {
        long totalPositiveSum = 0;
        int n = nums.length;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > 0) {
                totalPositiveSum += nums[i];
            } else {
                nums[i] = -nums[i];
            }
        }
        
        // Max heap to keep track of k largest sums
        PriorityQueue<Long> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        maxHeap.offer(totalPositiveSum);
        
        // Sort the absolute values array to process in order of additions
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= k - 1; i++) {
            if (maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
                break;
            }
            long currentSum = maxHeap.poll();
            
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                long newSum = currentSum - nums[j];
                maxHeap.offer(newSum);
                
                if (j + 1 < n && nums[j] == nums[j + 1]) {
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return maxHeap.poll();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        KSum ks = new KSum();
        int[] nums = {2, 4, -2};
        int k = 5;
        System.out.println(ks.kSum(nums, k));
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: The sorting step takes `O(n log n)`.
- **Priority Queue Operations**: The main loop runs `k` times, and each time it may add up to `n` elements to the priority queue. Each insertion/deletion operation in the priority queue takes `O(log k)`, and thus the time complexity is `O(k log k)`.
- **Overall**: The overall time complexity is `O(n log n + k log k)`.

This strategy leverages the properties of the max heap and ensures that we don't have to generate all possible subsequences, thus significantly improving the performance.
