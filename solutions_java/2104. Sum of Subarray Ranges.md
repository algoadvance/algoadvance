[Leetcode 2104. Sum of Subarray Ranges](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2104)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return the sum of all subarray ranges of `nums`.

A subarray range is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the subarray.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: The 6 subarrays of [1,2,3] are:
[1], range = 0
[2], range = 0
[3], range = 0
[1,2], range = 1
[2,3], range = 1
[1,2,3], range = 2
The sum of all ranges is 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 4.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: The 6 subarrays of [1,3,3] are:
[1], range = 0
[3], range = 0
[3], range = 0
[1,3], range = 2
[3,3], range = 0
[1,3,3], range = 2
The sum of all ranges is 0 + 0 + 0 + 2 + 0 + 2 = 4.
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [4,-2,-3,4,1]
Output: 59
Explanation: The sum of all subarray ranges of nums is 59.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the array size and the elements?**
    - Typically in such problems, the array size could range from 1 to 10^4, and the element values could be in the range of -10^9 to 10^9.
2. **Is there any specific requirement on time or space complexity?**
    - Would prefer more efficient solutions but let's aim first for correct quadratic solutions, as a subarray problem with range calculation inherently might lead to O(n^2) complexity.

### Strategy

1. **Brute Force Approach:**
    - Use nested loops to generate all possible subarrays.
    - For each subarray, compute the minimum and maximum values.
    - Compute the range and sum them up.

2. **Optimization:**
    - Consider possible ways to optimize, for instance, leveraging sliding window techniques or using data structures like deques to efficiently manage the min-max calculations.

### Code

Here's the brute-force solution to this problem:

```java
public class Solution {
    public long subArrayRanges(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        long sum = 0;

        for (int start = 0; start < n; start++) {
            int min = nums[start];
            int max = nums[start];

            for (int end = start; end < n; end++) {
                min = Math.min(min, nums[end]);
                max = Math.max(max, nums[end]);
                sum += (max - min);
            }
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The brute-force approach has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input array `nums`.
- Nested loops iterate over all subarrays, and for each subarray, we calculate the minimum and maximum values which are done within the inner loop itself.

In further interviews, you may be asked to optimize this to \(O(n)\) or \(O(n \log n)\) using more sophisticated approaches like segment trees, stacks, or other data structures which support efficient range queries. However, starting with a correct and clear \(O(n^2)\) solution is often a good base.
