[Leetcode 30. Substring with Concatenation of All Words](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l30)
## Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`. All the strings in `words` are of the same length. Return all starting indices of substring(s) in `s` that is a concatenation of each word in `words` exactly once, in any order, and without any intervening characters.

**Example:**
```
Input: s = "barfoothefoobarman", words = ["foo","bar"]
Output: [0,9]
Explanation: Substrings starting at index 0 and 9 are "barfoo" and "foobar" respectively. Both are concatenations of "foo" and "bar".
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are all characters in the input string `s` lowercase English letters?
2. What is the length range for the string `s` and the words in the list `words`?
3. Can the list `words` contain duplicate words?
4. What should be returned if there are no valid substrings?

## Strategy
1. Calculate the length of each word in `words` (since they are of the same length).
2. Calculate the total length of the concatenated string formed by all words.
3. Use a sliding window approach to check all possible starting points in `s` where such a concatenated substring could begin.
4. Use a hash map to count the frequency of each word in `words`.
5. For each possible starting point, check if a substring of the same length as the concatenated words can be formed by the words, using the frequency map for validation.

## Implementation

Here's the Java solution for the described problem:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findSubstring(String s, String[] words) {
        List<Integer> indices = new ArrayList<>();
        if (s == null || s.length() == 0 || words == null || words.length == 0) {
            return indices;
        }

        int wordLength = words[0].length();
        int numWords = words.length;
        int totalLength = wordLength * numWords;

        if (s.length() < totalLength) {
            return indices;
        }

        // Create a frequency map for the words
        Map<String, Integer> wordCount = new HashMap<>();
        for (String word : words) {
            wordCount.put(word, wordCount.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
        }

        // Sliding window approach
        for (int i = 0; i <= s.length() - totalLength; i++) {
            Map<String, Integer> seenWords = new HashMap<>();
            int j = 0;
            while (j < numWords) {
                int wordStartIndex = i + j * wordLength;
                String word = s.substring(wordStartIndex, wordStartIndex + wordLength);
                if (wordCount.containsKey(word)) {
                    seenWords.put(word, seenWords.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
                    if (seenWords.get(word) > wordCount.get(word)) {
                        break;
                    }
                } else {
                    break;
                }
                j++;
            }
            if (j == numWords) {
                indices.add(i);
            }
        }

        return indices;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        String s = "barfoothefoobarman";
        String[] words = {"foo", "bar"};
        System.out.println(sol.findSubstring(s, words)); // [0, 9]
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time complexity:** 
  - Constructing the frequency map: O(N), where N is the number of words.
  - Sliding window checking: O((L - totalLength + 1) * M), where L is the length of string `s`, and M is the length of any word in `words` (since all words are of the same length).
  - Overall: O((L - totalLength + 1) * M).

- **Space complexity:** 
  - Storing word counts: O(N).
  - Extra space for the seen words during the sliding window process: O(N) in the worst case where all words are unique and present in the current substring.
  - Therefore, the overall space complexity is O(N).
