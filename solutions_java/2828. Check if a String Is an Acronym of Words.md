[Leetcode 2828. Check if a String Is an Acronym of Words](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2828)
## Problem Statement

You are given a list of strings `words` and a string `s`. A string `s` is considered an acronym of the list `words` if it can be formed by concatenating the first character of each string in `words` in order. For example, the list `["alice", "bob", "charlie"]` generates the acronym "abc".

Write a function `isAcronym(List<String> words, String s)` which returns `true` if `s` is an acronym of `words`, and `false` otherwise.

---

### Example:
1. Input:
    - `words = ["alice", "bob", "charlie"]`
    - `s = "abc"`
   Output: `true`
   
2. Input:
    - `words = ["apple", "banana", "carrot"]`
    - `s = "ab"`
   Output: `false`

3. Input:
    - `words = ["dog", "elephant", "frog"]`
    - `s = "def"`
   Output: `true`

---

### Constraints:
- Each string in `words` will have at least one character.
- `1 <= words.length <= 100`
- `1 <= s.length <= 100`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Case Sensitivity**: Should the acronym matching be case-sensitive? For example, should "AbC" match `["alice", "bob", "charlie"]`?
   - Assume case-insensitivity unless stated otherwise.
   
2. **Punctuation and Special Characters**: Are there any special characters or punctuation in the strings?
   - Assume no special characters, all inputs are simple lowercase alphabetic strings by default.

---

## Strategy
1. **Initial Check**: If the length of `s` is not equal to the number of strings in `words`, return `false`.
2. **Iterate and Compare**: For each string in `words`, extract the first character and build the expected acronym. Compare it with `s`.
3. **Result**: If all characters match, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

---

## Code

```java
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public static boolean isAcronym(List<String> words, String s) {
        // If the length of the 's' is not equal to the number of words, it cannot be an acronym.
        if (words.size() != s.length()) {
            return false;
        }

        // Initialize the acronym string.
        StringBuilder acronym = new StringBuilder();
        
        // Build the acronym using the first character of each word.
        for (String word : words) {
            acronym.append(word.charAt(0));
        }
        
        // Compare the built acronym to the given string `s`.
        return acronym.toString().equals(s);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<String> words1 = List.of("alice", "bob", "charlie");
        String s1 = "abc";
        System.out.println(isAcronym(words1, s1));  // Should return true
    
        List<String> words2 = List.of("apple", "banana", "carrot");
        String s2 = "ab";
        System.out.println(isAcronym(words2, s2));  // Should return false
    
        List<String> words3 = List.of("dog", "elephant", "frog");
        String s3 = "def";
        System.out.println(isAcronym(words3, s3));  // Should return true
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of strings in the `words` list. We take the first character from each string once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for additional space used, except for the space required to store the result string, which is O(n).

(Note: If we are storing the acronym in a StringBuilder, and given the constraints, this is efficient and within acceptable limits.)
