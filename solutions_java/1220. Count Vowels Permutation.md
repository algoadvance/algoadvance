[Leetcode 1220. Count Vowels Permutation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1220)
Sure, let's go through the problem step by step.

### Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, your task is to count how many strings of length `n` can be formed under the following rules:

1. Each character in the string will be a vowel (`'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, `'u'`).
2. The rules for forming strings are:
   - 'a' can only be followed by 'e'.
   - 'e' can only be followed by 'a' and 'i'.
   - 'i' can only be followed by 'a', 'e', 'o', and 'u'.
   - 'o' can only be followed by 'i' and 'u'.
   - 'u' can only be followed by 'a'.

Return the number of strings of length `n` that can be formed under these constraints. As the answer may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Should we consider upper-case vowels?**
   - No, only lower-case vowels should be considered.
2. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - Typically for competitive programming problems like these, `n` can go up to a fairly high number like 10^9, but we should check the problem to confirm.

### Strategy

We'll use dynamic programming to solve this problem. The idea is to use a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of valid strings of length `i` which end with the j-th vowel. Given 5 vowels, we'll track the state transitions based on the rules provided:

1. Initialize a current state array for the first character since any character can start.
2. Iterate from 2 to n, updating the possible string counts based on the previous state and the given rules.
3. Use modulo operation to ensure the result remains within bounds.

Finally, the sum of all states for strings of length `n` will give us the final result.

### Code

Here is the implementation in Java:

```java
public class VowelPermutationCount {
    public int countVowelPermutation(int n) {
        // Constants
        int MOD = 1_000_000_007;

        // Initialize dp arrays for current and previous states
        long[] dp = new long[5];
        // Starting with one occurrence for each vowel
        Arrays.fill(dp, 1);

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            // Temporary array for the new state
            long[] newDp = new long[5];

            // Transition rules based on the problem statement
            newDp[0] = (dp[1] + dp[2] + dp[4]) % MOD; // 'a' -> 'e', 'i', 'u'
            newDp[1] = (dp[0] + dp[2]) % MOD;         // 'e' -> 'a', 'i'
            newDp[2] = (dp[1] + dp[3]) % MOD;         // 'i' -> 'e', 'o'
            newDp[3] = dp[2];                         // 'o' -> 'i'
            newDp[4] = (dp[2] + dp[3]) % MOD;         // 'u' -> 'i', 'o'

            // Update dp with the new values
            dp = newDp;
        }

        // Sum all the possible dp end states for strings of length n
        long result = 0;
        for (long x : dp) {
            result = (result + x) % MOD;
        }

        return (int) result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        VowelPermutationCount vpc = new VowelPermutationCount();
        int n = 5;
        System.out.println(vpc.countVowelPermutation(n)); // Example usage
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)` since we iterate from 1 to `n` and in each iteration, we perform a constant amount of work (5 operations for updating the state). The space complexity is `O(1)` as we are only using a fixed-size array for our DP states.

Feel free to ask if you have any more questions or need further clarification!
