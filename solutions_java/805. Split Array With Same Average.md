[Leetcode 805. Split Array With Same Average](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l805)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`. Split the array into two parts of lengths `m` and `n - m` such that the average of both parts is the same. Return `true` if you can find a way to do that or `false` otherwise.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for `n`?**
   - n can be from 1 up to 30.

2. **Can `nums` contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, `nums` can contain negative, zero, and positive numbers.

3. **Is it mandatory to split the array into two non-empty parts?**
   - Yes, both parts must be non-empty.

4. **Do the parts need to be contiguous subarrays?**
   - No, the parts can consist of any elements in the array, not necessarily contiguous ones.

## Strategy

1. **Sum of Elements and Average**: 
   - Calculate the total sum of the array and the average. If it's not possible for any subset to have an integer average under the given constraints, return `false`.

2. **Dynamic Programming and Combinations**:
   - Use dynamic programming (DP) and combinatorial logic to explore possible subsets and check if they can achieve the same average as the original array. Track possible sums that can be achieved for different subset sizes.

3. **Optimization Considerations**:
   - Use a memoization technique to keep track of visited states and prune the search space.

## Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    public boolean splitArraySameAverage(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int totalSum = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            totalSum += num;
        }
        
        Map<Integer, Map<Integer, Boolean>> memo = new HashMap<>();
        for (int len = 1; len <= n / 2; len++) {
            if ((totalSum * len) % n == 0) {
                if (canFindSubset(nums, len, (totalSum * len) / n, 0, memo)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    private boolean canFindSubset(int[] nums, int length, int target, int start, Map<Integer, Map<Integer, Boolean>> memo) {
        if (length == 0) return target == 0;
        if (start == nums.length) return false;
        if (memo.containsKey(length) && memo.get(length).containsKey(target)) {
            return memo.get(length).get(target);
        }
        
        boolean found = false;
        if (nums[start] <= target) {
            found = canFindSubset(nums, length - 1, target - nums[start], start + 1, memo);
        }
        
        if (!found) {
            found = canFindSubset(nums, length, target, start + 1, memo);
        }
        
        memo.computeIfAbsent(length, k -> new HashMap<>()).put(target, found);
        return found;
    }
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Initialization**:
   - We first calculate the total sum of all elements in the array.
   
2. **Memoization Setup**:
   - We set up a memoization map to avoid re-computation for states we've already processed.

3. **Checking Valid Subsets**:
   - We iterate through possible subset lengths from `1` to `n/2` and determine if a subset of that length can have the same average (i.e., can achieve a target sum based on the average).

4. **Recursive Function**:
   - The function `canFindSubset` recursively checks whether a subset of given length and target sum can be found. It uses memoization to store and reuse results of subproblems, ensuring optimal performance.

## Time Complexity

- The worst-case time complexity is \(O(n \times \text{total sum} \times \text{length})\), meaning it depends on the length of the array, the total sum, and the possible subset lengths.
- However, in practice, the memoization and pruning significantly reduce the number of states processed, making it more efficient. The average time complexity will often be much less due to these optimizations.
