[Leetcode 778. Swim in Rising Water full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l778)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `grid` where each value represents the elevation at that point `grid[i][j]`. The task is to find the minimum time required to swim from the top-left corner (0,0) to the bottom-right corner (n-1,n-1) under the following constraints:

- You can swim in four directions: up, down, left, and right.
- During each move, the water level rises to at least the maximum elevation encountered along the path.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are all values in the grid unique?
   **A:** Yes, all the values in the grid are unique according to the problem statement on LeetCode.

2. **Q:** What are the possible sizes of the grid?
   **A:** The grid is an `n x n` matrix, where `1 <= n <= 50`.

3. **Q:** Are negative elevations possible?
   **A:** No, based on typical problem constraints, elevation values are non-negative integers.

4. **Q:** Is there a guaranteed path from the top-left to bottom-right corners?
   **A:** Yes, there is always a path as defined by the problem constraints.

## Strategy

The strategy combines a priority queue (min-heap) with a breadth-first search (BFS):

1. Use a priority queue to always expand the lowest possible "maximum height" encountered at any point in the grid.
2. Keep a boolean matrix to check visited nodes to avoid cycles.
3. Push the starting point `(0,0)` into the priority queue with its elevation as the priority.
4. Expand the point with the lowest elevation from the priority queue.
5. Propagate to its neighboring points if they have not been visited.
6. Continue the process until the point `(n-1, n-1)` is reached.

## Code

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public class SwimInRisingWater {
    public int swimInWater(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[n][n];
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a[2] - b[2]);
        
        // Starting with the top-left cell
        pq.offer(new int[] {0, 0, grid[0][0]});
        int[][] directions = \ use example from above
        visited[0][0] = true;
        
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            int[] curr = pq.poll();
            int x = curr[0];
            int y = curr[1];
            int maxElevation = curr[2];
            
            // If we have reached the bottom-right corner
            if (x == n - 1 && y == n - 1) {
                return maxElevation;
            }
            
            // Explore neighbors
            for (int[] dir : directions) {
                int nx = x + dir[0];
                int ny = y + dir[1];
                
                if (nx >= 0 && nx < n && ny >= 0 && ny < n && !visited[nx][ny]) {
                    visited[nx][ny] = true;
                    pq.offer(new int[] {nx, ny, Math.max(maxElevation, grid[nx][ny])});
                }
            }
        }
        
        return -1; // This line will never be reached in a valid input scenario.
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity has several components:

- Each cell is inserted and extracted from the priority queue once, giving us `O(n^2 log n^2)` operations due to the log factor of the priority queue.
- Simplifying this, we get `O(n^2 log n)` because `n^2` terms dominate and `log n^2` simplifies to `2 log n`.

Thus, the **overall time complexity** is `O(n^2 log n)`.
