[Leetcode 2766. Relocate Marbles](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2766)
### Problem Statement:

You are given three arrays:
- `nums`: An integer array representing the positions of marbles.
- `moveFrom`: An integer array representing start positions of marbles we want to move.
- `moveTo`: An integer array representing end positions to where we want to move the marbles.

Each element in `moveFrom` indicates a position in `nums` from which a marble should be moved, and the corresponding element in `moveTo` indicates the position to which the marble should be moved.

Implement a function:

```java
public List<Integer> relocateMarbles(int[] nums, int[] moveFrom, int[] moveTo)
```

Return a sorted list of values representing all the possible marble positions after performing all moves.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Can marbles be moved outside the initial range of positions?**
   - No, each position after moves should remain valid within the typical range specified by common constraint.

2. **Can a marble be moved to the position where another marble currently exists?**
   - Yes, marbles can end up at the same position.

3. **What should be the behavior if `moveFrom` and`moveTo` arrays have different lengths?**
   - Assume that `moveFrom` and `moveTo` arrays always have the same length.

4. **Are there any constraints on the input size?**
   - Standard constraint would be applied to keep the complexity manageable, e.g., 1 <= nums.length, moveFrom.length == moveTo.length <= 10^4.

### Strategy:

1. **Create a Set Data Structure**:
   - Use a `Set` to keep track of the current positions of the marbles. This helps in ensuring positions are unique and allows efficient update operations.

2. **Process Moves**:
   - For each move operation, remove the marble's current position from the `Set` and add its new position.

3. **Sort and Return**:
   - Convert the `Set` to a `List`, sort it and return.

### Code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class RelocateMarbles {

    public List<Integer> relocateMarbles(int[] nums, int[] moveFrom, int[] moveTo) {
        Set<Integer> marblePositions = new HashSet<>();
        
        // Initialize the set with initial positions of marbles
        for (int num : nums) {
            marblePositions.add(num);
        }
        
        // Process each move
        for (int i = 0; i < moveFrom.length; i++) {
            // Remove the marble from initial position
            marblePositions.remove(moveFrom[i]);
            // Add the marble to the new position
            marblePositions.add(moveTo[i]);
        }
        
        // Convert the Set to a List and sort it
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>(marblePositions);
        Collections.sort(result);
        
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RelocateMarbles solution = new RelocateMarbles();
        int[] nums = {1, 3, 5, 7};
        int[] moveFrom = {1, 7};
        int[] moveTo = {2, 6};
        List<Integer> result = solution.relocateMarbles(nums, moveFrom, moveTo);
        System.out.println(result); // Should output [2, 3, 5, 6]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Initialization**: O(n) for adding initial positions to the `Set` where `n` is the length of `nums`.
- **Processing Moves**: O(m) for processing the move operations where `m` is the length of `moveFrom` and `moveTo`.
- **Sorting**: O(k log k) where `k` is the number of unique positions in the `Set`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n + m + k log k)**, which should be efficient given the problem constraints.
