[Leetcode 910. Smallest Range II full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l910)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. For each index `i` where `0 <= i < nums.length`, change `nums[i]` to be either `nums[i] + k` or `nums[i] - k`. The score of `nums` is the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in `nums`. Return the minimum score of `nums` after changing the values at each index.

### Example
1. Input: `nums = [1, 3, 6]`, `k = 3`
   Output: `3`
   Explanation: Change `nums` to be `[4, 6, 3]`. The score is `6 - 3 = 3`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What values will the elements of `nums` take?**
   * The elements of `nums` are integers and can be positive, negative or zero.
2. **What is the size range of `nums`?**
   * The length of `nums` will be between `1` and `10^4`.
3. **Would there be a case when `k` is zero?**
   * Yes, `k` can be zero in which case we won't change any elements, but we need to handle that explicitly.

## Strategy
To minimize the difference between the max and min values of the transformed array:
1. Sort the array to make it easier to determine the possible maximum and minimum values after transformation.
2. After sorting, consider the initial range as `nums[n-1] - nums[0]` (max - min of the sorted array).
3. Then explore the minimum possible range after introducing `k`:
    - If we add `k` to the minimum element or subtract `k` from it,
    - If we subtract `k` from the maximum element or add `k` to it,
    - This gives different ranges which we must check to find the minimum difference.

### Steps:
1. Sort the array.
2. Initialize the result with the initial range `nums[n-1] - nums[0]`.
3. Iterate through each index and calculate the new possible max and min by applying `+k` or `-k` to the boundaries:
    - For each index `i` from `0` to `n-2`:
        - Calculate potential new max as the maximum of `nums[i] + k` and `nums[n-1] - k`.
        - Calculate potential new min as the minimum of `nums[0] + k` and `nums[i+1] - k`.
        - Update the result with the minimum range found.

## Code

```java
public class SmallestRangeII {
    public int smallestRangeII(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Sort the array
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        
        int n = nums.length;
        // Initial max and min range as it is before any modifications
        int result = nums[n - 1] - nums[0];
        
        // Iterate through the array and calculate the potential new minimum and maximum ranges
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            int maxVal = Math.max(nums[i] + k, nums[n - 1] - k);
            int minVal = Math.min(nums[0] + k, nums[i + 1] - k);
            // Update the result with the minimum range
            result = Math.min(result, maxVal - minVal);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: The sorting operation takes `O(n log n)` time.
- **Iteration**: The main iteration through the array takes `O(n)` time.
Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.

This strategy ensures we explore all possible transformations effectively to find the minimum possible score.
