[Leetcode 1481. Least Number of Unique Integers after K Removals](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1481)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `k`. The aim is to remove exactly `k` elements from `arr` such that the number of unique integers in the array is minimized afterward. Return the minimum number of unique integers left in the array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the range of the size of `arr`? *(e.g., is it up to 10^5 or more/less?)*
    - What is the range of the integers in `arr`? *(e.g., are they all positive or can they be negative as well?)*
    - Can `k` be larger than the length of `arr`?

2. **Output**:
    - Should the function return an integer representing the minimum number of unique integers left?

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - What should be returned if `k` is 0?
    - What if all elements are the same or all are unique?

### Strategy
1. **Frequency Count**: 
    - First, determine the frequency of each integer in `arr`.
    
2. **Heap/Priority Queue**:
    - Use a min-heap (priority queue) to handle the frequencies of the unique elements. A min-heap can efficiently give us the element with the lowest frequency, which is optimal for minimizing the number of unique integers.
    
3. **Removal Process**:
    - Remove the elements starting with the smallest frequencies until `k` removals are achieved.
    - Each time you remove instances of an integer, reduce `k` by the frequency of that integer. If `k` becomes zero, compute the remaining unique integers in the heap.

### Code

Here is a Java implementation of the solution:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public class Solution {
    public int findLeastNumOfUniqueInts(int[] arr, int k) {
        // Frequency map for the elements in arr
        Map<Integer, Integer> freqMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (int num : arr) {
            freqMap.put(num, freqMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        // Priority Queue (Min Heap) for frequencies
        PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
        for (int freq : freqMap.values()) {
            minHeap.offer(freq);
        }
        
        // Removal process
        while (k > 0) {
            k -= minHeap.poll(); // Remove the least frequent element
            if (k >= 0) {
                // if k >= 0 means we have removed one unique number
                freqMap.size--;
            }
        }
        
        return freqMap.size();
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **O(n)** for counting frequencies where `n` is the number of elements in `arr`.
- **O(m log m)** for inserting `m` unique elements into the min-heap.
- **O(m log m)** for the removal operations from the min-heap.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n + m log m)**, where `n` is the length of the array and `m` is the number of unique elements.
