[Leetcode 1653. Minimum Deletions to Make String Balanced](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1653)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s` consisting only of characters 'a' and 'b', you can delete some characters from the string to make the string balanced. The string is considered balanced if no 'a' appears after any 'b'.

You need to return the minimum number of deletions needed to make the string balanced.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
   - The length of the string `s` will be at most `10^5`.

2. **Character Composition**: Will the string always be a mix of 'a' and 'b', or can it have only 'a's or only 'b's?
   - The string can consist of any combination of 'a's and 'b's, including potentially strings with only one type of character.

3. **Empty String**: How should an empty string be handled?
   - An empty string is already balanced, so no deletions are needed.

4. **Case Sensitivity**: Are the characters case-sensitive?
   - The problem specifies characters 'a' and 'b', implying case sensitivity.

### Strategy
To determine the minimum number of deletions required to make the string balanced, we can use the following strategy:
1. Traverse the string and count all the 'a's (let's call this `totalA`).
2. Use a two-pointer technique or a running tally to determine the minimum deletions needed at each position.
3. As we traverse the string:
   - Maintain a running count of 'a's encountered so far (`countA`).
   - Maintain a count of 'b's encountered so far (`countB`).
   - At each character position, calculate the deletions needed if the 'b's seen so far were retained and the rest of the 'a's after the current position were deleted.
4. The minimum of these deletion counts across all positions will give the desired result.

### Code
Here's the Java implementation of this strategy:

```java
public class MinimumDeletions {
    public int minimumDeletions(String s) {
        // count total number of 'a's in the string
        int totalA = 0;
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == 'a') {
                totalA++;
            }
        }
        
        int countA = 0;
        int countB = 0;
        int minDeletions = totalA; // if we delete all 'a's when there are no 'b's

        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            // if we encounter 'b', we might consider not deleting this 'b'
            if (c == 'b') {
                countB++;
            } else {
                // if we encounter 'a', we might consider deleting this 'a'
                countA++;
            }

            // deletions required: all previous 'b's retained and delete remaining 'a's after current position
            int deletions = countB + (totalA - countA);
            minDeletions = Math.min(minDeletions, deletions);
        }
        
        return minDeletions;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumDeletions solution = new MinimumDeletions();
        System.out.println(solution.minimumDeletions("aababbab")); // Output: 2
        System.out.println(solution.minimumDeletions("bbaaaa")); // Output: 2
        System.out.println(solution.minimumDeletions("aaaaaabbbbb")); // Output: 0
        System.out.println(solution.minimumDeletions("")); // Output: 0
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. We make a single pass to count the 'a's and then another single pass to calculate the minimum deletions.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we use a constant amount of extra space, regardless of the input size.
