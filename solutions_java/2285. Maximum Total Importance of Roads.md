[Leetcode 2285. Maximum Total Importance of Roads](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2285)
## Problem Statement

You are given:
- An integer `n` representing the number of cities in a country.
- A 2D integer array `roads`, where `roads[i] = [a_i, b_i]` denotes a road between cities `a_i` and `b_i`.

The importance of a city is a positive integer. The total importance of all roads is obtained by adding up the importance of the two cities at both ends of each road. Assign the importance to each city such that the total importance of all roads is maximized and return it.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on `n` and `roads`?**
   - For instance, is there a maximum number of cities or roads?

2. **Do we need to consider disconnected cities?**
   - Are we only given roads for connected cities, or do we need to handle cities with no roads?

3. **Can there be multiple roads between the same pair of cities?**
   - Should the solution handle duplicates?

4. **Are the cities labeled from 1 to n or 0 to n-1?**
   - This helps to decide how to index them in code.

5. **Is there any constraint on the importance values?**
   - Are they constrained by any specific range or all positive integers are valid?

## Strategy

To maximize the total importance of all roads, it makes sense to assign higher importance values to cities with more connections. The more connections a city has, the more often its importance will be added into the sum.

Steps:
1. **Calculate Degree**: Calculate the degree (number of connections) for each city.
2. **Sort by Degree**: Sort cities based on their degree in descending order.
3. **Assign Importance**: Assign the maximum importance (from n to 1) to cities with the highest degree first.
4. **Compute the Total Importance**: Compute the total importance based on the assigned importances.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public long maximumImportance(int n, int[][] roads) {
        // Step 1: Calculate the degree for each city
        int[] degree = new int[n];
        for (int[] road : roads) {
            degree[road[0]]++;
            degree[road[1]]++;
        }
        
        // Step 2: Create an array of city indices based on their degree
        Integer[] cityIndices = new Integer[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cityIndices[i] = i;
        }
        
        // Step 3: Sort the city indices based on their degree in descending order
        Arrays.sort(cityIndices, (a, b) -> degree[b] - degree[a]);
        
        // Step 4: Assign importance values to cities
        int[] importance = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            importance[cityIndices[i]] = n - i;
        }
        
        // Step 5: Calculate the total importance of all roads
        long totalImportance = 0;
        for (int[] road : roads) {
            totalImportance += importance[road[0]] + importance[road[1]];
        }
        
        return totalImportance;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        
        // Test cases
        int n1 = 5;
        int[][] roads1 = // use example from above
        System.out.println(solution.maximumImportance(n1, roads1)); // Example output: 43
        
        int n2 = 5;
        int[][] roads2 = // use example from above
        System.out.println(solution.maximumImportance(n2, roads2)); // Example output: 25
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Degree Calculation**: O(E), where E is the number of roads.
2. **Sorting Cities by Degree**: O(N log N), where N is the number of cities.
3. **Assigning Importance and Calculating Total Importance**: O(E).

Overall, the time complexity is **O(E + N log N)**. Given the constraints typically seen in LeetCode problems, this should be efficient enough for decent-sized inputs.
