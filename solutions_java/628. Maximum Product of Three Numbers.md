[Leetcode 628. Maximum Product of Three Numbers full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l628)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, find three numbers whose product is maximum and return the maximum product.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What are the constraints on the array `nums`?
   - **A:** At least three integers in the array. The array length will be between 3 and 10^4, and values will range between -1000 to 1000.

2. **Q:** Can the numbers be both positive and negative?
   - **A:** Yes, the array can contain both positive and negative numbers including zero.

3. **Q:** What if all numbers are negative?
   - **A:** The solution should still return the maximum product among any three selected numbers.

### Strategy
1. **Sort the Array:**
   - The simplest approach is to sort the array first.
   - After sorting, the potential candidates for the maximum product will be the largest three numbers or the two smallest numbers (most negative) and the largest number.

2. **Calculate Candidate Products:**
   - From the sorted array, compute the product of the last three elements: `nums[len-1] * nums[len-2] * nums[len-3]`.
   - Compute the product of the two smallest elements and the largest element: `nums[0] * nums[1] * nums[len-1]`.

3. **Return the Maximum:**
   - Return the maximum value between the two computed products.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int maximumProduct(int[] nums) {
        // Sort the array
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        
        int n = nums.length;
        // Candidate 1: product of the three largest numbers
        int candidate1 = nums[n-1] * nums[n-2] * nums[n-3];
        // Candidate 2: product of the two smallest numbers and the largest number
        int candidate2 = nums[0] * nums[1] * nums[n-1];
        
        // Return the maximum of the two candidates
        return Math.max(candidate1, candidate2);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting the array:** `O(n log n)` where `n` is the length of the array.
- **Computing the products and max:** `O(1)` constant time operation.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)` due to sorting.

This method ensures that we correctly identify the maximum product by considering both positive and negative numbers efficiently.
