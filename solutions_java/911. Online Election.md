[Leetcode 911. Online Election](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l911)
### Problem Statement

The problem "911. Online Election" on LeetCode can be summarized as follows:

You have been given two arrays, `persons` and `times`. The `persons[i]` represents the person that was voted for at time `times[i]`.

Implement the `TopVotedCandidate` class with the following methods:

- `TopVotedCandidate(int[] persons, int[] times)`: Initializes the object with the persons and times arrays.
- `int q(int t)`: Returns the number of the person that was leading the election at time `t`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What if the `times` array contains duplicate values?**
   - For this problem, it's implied that `times` is strictly increasing and contains unique values.
   
2. **How large can the arrays be?**
   - According to the problem constraints, the size of `persons` and `times` can be up to `5000`.

3. **What should be returned if `t` is earlier than the first vote time?**
   - It's safe to assume that such scenarios won't be queried according to the problem constraints.

### Strategy

1. **Creating a Lead Tracking System:**
   - We need to track the leading candidate at each timestamp up to the given query time `t`.
   
2. **Precompute Leading Candidates:**
   - We can iterate through the `persons` array and maintain a count of votes for each candidate.
   - As we iterate, keep track of the current leading candidate.
   - Store the leading candidate at each time in a list.

3. **Efficient Query Handling:**
   - Precompute the results for all times in the given `times` array.
   - For each query `q(t)`, perform a binary search to find the largest time `<= t` and return the leading candidate at that time.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

class TopVotedCandidate {
    private Map<Integer, Integer> leadingCandidates;
    private int[] times;

    public TopVotedCandidate(int[] persons, int[] times) {
        this.times = times;
        this.leadingCandidates = new HashMap<>();
        Map<Integer, Integer> voteCounts = new HashMap<>();
        
        int leadingCandidate = -1;
        int maxVotes = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < persons.length; i++) {
            int person = persons[i];
            int time = times[i];
            
            voteCounts.put(person, voteCounts.getOrDefault(person, 0) + 1);
            if (voteCounts.get(person) >= maxVotes) {
                if (voteCounts.get(person) > maxVotes || person != leadingCandidate) {
                    leadingCandidate = person;
                    maxVotes = voteCounts.get(person);
                }
            }
            leadingCandidates.put(time, leadingCandidate);
        }
    }
    
    public int q(int t) {
        int left = 0, right = times.length - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (times[mid] <= t) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return leadingCandidates.get(times[right]);
    }
}

```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization (Constructor):** O(N), where N is the number of votes. This is because we make a single pass through the `persons` and `times` arrays and update the HashMaps.
- **Querying (q(int t)):** O(log N) per query due to the binary search on the `times` array.

This approach ensures efficient precomputation and quick query responses, making the class suitable for handling up to 5000 votes gracefully.
