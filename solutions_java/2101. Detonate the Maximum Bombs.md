[Leetcode 2101. Detonate the Maximum Bombs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2101)
## Problem Statement
You are given a list of bombs. The range of a bomb determines how far its effect can be. If a bomb explodes, all bombs that are in its range will also explode. Determine the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated if you are allowed to start the detonation with any one bomb.

- Each bomb `i` is represented by a tuple `(x[i], y[i], r[i])` where `(x[i], y[i])` is the coordinate of the bomb and `r[i]` is the radius of the bomb.
- Two bombs can be in the range of each other if the Euclidean distance between their coordinates is less than or equal to the sum of their radii.

### Example:
```
Input:
bombs = [[2,1,3],[6,1,4]]

Output:
2

Explanation:
The first bomb could detonate the second bomb. Therefore, we can detonate 2 bombs.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the coordinates and radii?**
   The coordinates and radii are constrained within typical integer ranges for such problems, typically between \(-10^6\) and \(10^6\).

2. **Is the input always well-formed?**
   Yes, you can assume the input is always in the correct form.

3. **Is there a guaranteed solution?**
   There will always be at least one bomb to detonate.

## Strategy
1. **Model Bombs and Their Effective Ranges:** 
   - Each bomb can be represented as a node in a graph.
   - A directed edge from bomb `i` to bomb `j` indicates that bomb `i` can detonate bomb `j`.

2. **Graph Construction:**
   - For each pair of bombs, check if they are in range by using the Euclidean distance.

3. **Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - Use DFS or BFS to explore all bombs starting from each bomb to determine the total number of bombs that can be detonated.

4. **Track the Maximum Detonations:**
   - Keep track of the maximum number of bombs detonated when starting from each bomb.

## Code
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class MaximumBombs {
    public int maximumDetonation(int[][] bombs) {
        int n = bombs.length;
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Initialize graph
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }

        // Build the adjacency list
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i != j && inRange(bombs[i], bombs[j])) {
                    graph.get(i).add(j);
                }
            }
        }

        // Function to perform DFS traversal and return the count of detonated bombs
        boolean[] visited;
        int maxDetonated = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            visited = new boolean[n];
            maxDetonated = Math.max(maxDetonated, dfs(i, graph, visited));
        }
        
        return maxDetonated;
    }
    
    private boolean inRange(int[] bomb1, int[] bomb2) {
        long x1 = bomb1[0], y1 = bomb1[1], r1 = bomb1[2];
        long x2 = bomb2[0], y2 = bomb2[1];
        // Check Euclidean distance squared to avoid precision issues
        long distSq = (x1 - x2) * (x1 - x2) + (y1 - y2) * (y1 - y2);
        long rangeSq = r1 * r1;
        return distSq <= rangeSq;
    }
    
    private int dfs(int node, List<List<Integer>> graph, boolean[] visited) {
        visited[node] = true;
        int count = 1; // Count current bomb
        for (int neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                count += dfs(neighbor, graph, visited);
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Graph Construction:** \(O(n^2)\) where \(n\) is the number of bombs because we are checking the distance between each pair of bombs.
- **DFS Traversal:** \(O(n + E)\) where \(E\) is the number of edges in the graph.
- Since the graph is essentially dense due to the \(O(n^2)\) checks, our overall complexity remains \(O(n^2)\).

This solution ensures an efficient detonation calculation and maximum bomb count determination.
