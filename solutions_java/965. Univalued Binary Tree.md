[Leetcode 965. Univalued Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l965)
### Problem Statement:

Given a binary tree, determine if it is a univalued binary tree. A binary tree is univalued if every node in the tree has the same value.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **What is the definition of the "value" of a node?**
   - The value of a node is an integer associated with each node in the tree.

2. **What should be the output if the tree is empty?**
   - If the tree is empty, we consider it univalued, so the output should be `true`.

3. **Can the node contain negative values?**
   - Yes, nodes can contain negative values.

4. **Is there a limit to the depth of the tree?**
   - Generally, no strict limit in practical terms, but the solution should handle typical binary tree depths efficiently.

### Strategy:

1. **Recursive Approach**:
   - Use a recursive approach to compare the value of each node with the value of the root node.
   - Define a helper function to perform this comparison for each node and its children.

2. **Base Case**:
   - If the current node is `null`, return `true` because an empty subtree is trivially univalued.

3. **Recursive Case**:
   - Compare the current node's value with the root's value.
   - Also, recursively check the left and right subtrees.

### Code:

```java
/**
* Definition for a binary tree node.
* public class TreeNode {
*     int val;
*     TreeNode left;
*     TreeNode right;
*     TreeNode() {}
*     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
*     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
*         this.val = val;
*         this.left = left;
*         this.right = right;
*     }
* }
*/

public class Solution {
    public boolean isUnivalTree(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return true;
        }
        return isUnivalTreeHelper(root, root.val);
    }
    
    private boolean isUnivalTreeHelper(TreeNode node, int value) {
        if (node == null) {
            return true;
        }
        if (node.val != value) {
            return false;
        }
        return isUnivalTreeHelper(node.left, value) && isUnivalTreeHelper(node.right, value);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(h) where h is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursion stack used in the depth-first traversal.

This solution efficiently checks every node's value against the root's value to determine if the binary tree is univalued.
