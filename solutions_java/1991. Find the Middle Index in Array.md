[Leetcode 1991. Find the Middle Index in Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1991)
### Problem Statement

Find the Middle Index in Array

Given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`, find the leftmost middleIndex (if exists) such that:
- The sum of elements to the left of `middleIndex` is equal to the sum of elements to the right of `middleIndex`.

If there is no such index, return -1. Note that `middleIndex` should not be considered to be part of either the left sum or the right sum.

Example:
```
Input: nums = [2, 3, -1, 8, 4]
Output: 3
Explanation: 
The sum of the numbers to the left of index 3 is: 2 + 3 + -1 = 4
The sum of the numbers to the right of index 3 is: 4 = 4
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   Yes, the array can contain negative as well as positive integers.

2. **Will the array always have at least one element?**
   Constraints typically state the array size, but let's assume the array will have at least one element for now.

3. **Are there any constraints on time complexity?**
   While no explicit constraints are provided, we should aim for an optimal solution. Ideally, a solution better than `O(n^2)` should be considered.

### Strategy

To find the middle index, we can use the following approach:
1. Calculate the total sum of the array.
2. Initialize a variable `leftSum` to 0. This will be used to store the sum of elements to the left of the current index.
3. Iterate over the array and for each element:
   - Calculate the sum of elements to the right using the formula: `totalSum - leftSum - nums[i]`.
   - Check if `leftSum` is equal to the right sum.
   - If they are equal, return the current index.
   - Update `leftSum` by adding the current element.
4. If no such index is found, return -1.

### Code

Here's the Java solution for the problem:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int findMiddleIndex(int[] nums) {
        int totalSum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            totalSum += num;
        }
        
        int leftSum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (leftSum == totalSum - leftSum - nums[i]) {
                return i;
            }
            leftSum += nums[i];
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Calculate Total Sum**:
   - Compute the total sum of all elements in the array.
   
2. **Iterate and Check**:
   - Initialize `leftSum` to 0.
   - For each element, compute the right sum and check if it matches with `leftSum`.
   - If it matches, return the current index.
   - Update `leftSum` to include the current element.

3. **Return -1**:
   - If no such index is found after iterating through the array, return -1.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array. This is because we are iterating through the array twice:
- Once to calculate the total sum.
- Once to find the middle index while maintaining the left sum.

The space complexity is `O(1)` as we are using only a few extra variables.

This approach ensures that we find the solution efficiently.
