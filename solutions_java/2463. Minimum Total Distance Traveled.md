[Leetcode 2463. Minimum Total Distance Traveled](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2463)
## Problem Statement

You are given two arrays, `robot` and `factory`, where:
- `robot[i]` represents the position of the i-th robot.
- `factory[j]` represents the position of the j-th factory.

You want to assign each robot to a factory such that the total distance traveled by all robots is minimized. The total distance traveled is defined as the sum of the distances each robot needs to travel to reach its assigned factory.

Return the minimum total distance traveled.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: robot = [0,4,8], factory = [1,2,7]
Output: 5
Explanation: The optimal assignment is:
- Robot 0 -> Factory 0, distance = |0 - 1| = 1
- Robot 1 -> Factory 0, distance = |4 - 1| = 3
- Robot 2 -> Factory 2, distance = |8 - 7| = 1
Total distance = 1 + 3 + 1 = 5
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: robot = [4,8,1], factory = [1,2,3]
Output: 5
Explanation: The optimal assignment is:
- Robot 0 -> Factory 0, distance = |4 - 1| = 3
- Robot 1 -> Factory 2, distance = |8 - 3| = 5
- Robot 2 -> Factory 1, distance = |1 - 2| = 1
Total distance = 3 + 5 + 1 = 9
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints & Edge Cases**:
   - Are there any constraints on the size of the `robot` and `factory` arrays?
   - Can there be multiple robots or factories at the same position?
   - Is there a maximum distance that a robot can travel to reach a factory?

2. **Input Validation**:
   - Should we assume that input always consists of valid integer arrays?
   - Will there always be at least one robot and one factory?

3. **Output Precision**:
   - Should we consider the result modulo some number in case of large outputs?

## Strategy

The goal is to minimize the total travel distance. This problem can be related to "Assignment Problem" in combinatorial optimization, but here we use a greedy approach (Sorting Method) which has proven effective for these types of problems.

### Steps:
1. **Sort both arrays**:
   - Sorting both `robot` and `factory` arrays will allow us to consider closer positions first. The intuition is that minimizing travel distance between closest positions is likely to minimize the total distance.

2. **Greedy Pairing**:
   - Pair each robot with the nearest available factory in a sorted manner.

### Constraints Consideration:
- The time complexity of sorting is \(O(n \log n)\).
- The greedy pairing algorithm runs in \(O(n)\).
- Therefore, the overall time complexity should be \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the maximum of the lengths of the two arrays.

## Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int minTotalDistance(int[] robot, int[] factory) {
        Arrays.sort(robot);
        Arrays.sort(factory);
        
        int totalDistance = 0;
        int rIndex = 0, fIndex = 0;
        
        while (rIndex < robot.length && fIndex < factory.length) {
            totalDistance += Math.abs(robot[rIndex] - factory[fIndex]);
            rIndex++;
            fIndex++;
        }
        
        return totalDistance;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] robot = {0, 4, 8};
        int[] factory = {1, 2, 7};
        System.out.println(solution.minTotalDistance(robot, factory)); // Output: 5
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity Analysis

- **Sorting Step**: Sorting both arrays takes \(O(n \log n)\) time.
- **Greedy Pairing Step**: Pairing each robot with a factory takes \(O(n)\) time.
- **Total Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the longer array (`robot` or `factory`).

This approach is efficient given the context and constraints typically expected in such problems.
