[Leetcode 152. Maximum Product Subarray](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l152)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, find a contiguous non-empty subarray within the array that has the largest product, and return the product.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [2,3,-2,4]
Output: 6
Explanation: [2,3] has the largest product 6.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [-2,0,-1]
Output: 0
Explanation: The result cannot be 2, because [-2,-1] is not a subarray.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What should be returned if the array is empty?
   - **A:** The problem specifies that the input array is non-empty.

2. **Q:** Can the array contain both positive and negative numbers?
   - **A:** Yes, the array can contain positive, negative, and zero values.

3. **Q:** What will be the size range of the input array?
   - **A:** The size of the input array is typically constrained by the problem specifications; we will assume it to be reasonable for typical integer array problems (e.g., 1 <= nums.length <= 2 * 10^4).

### Strategy
1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - We need to keep track of both the maximum and minimum product subarray ending at the current position since a minimum product (negative value) multiplied by a negative number could become a maximum product.
   - Use two variables to maintain the maximum and minimum products ending at the current index.
   - Iterate through the array, updating these two variables accordingly.
   - Update the result whenever the maximum product variable is updated.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxProduct(int[] nums) {
        // Edge case: Empty array is not allowed as per problem statement
        if(nums.length == 0) return 0;
        
        // Initialize the variables for tracking maximum and minimum products
        int maxProduct = nums[0];
        int minProduct = nums[0];
        int result = nums[0];
        
        // Iterate through the array starting from index 1
        for(int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            // If the current number is negative, swap the max and min products
            if(nums[i] < 0){
                int temp = maxProduct;
                maxProduct = minProduct;
                minProduct = temp;
            }
            
            // Update the maximum and minimum products ending at the current position
            maxProduct = Math.max(nums[i], maxProduct * nums[i]);
            minProduct = Math.min(nums[i], minProduct * nums[i]);
            
            // Update the result with the maximum found so far
            result = Math.max(result, maxProduct);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of elements in the input array. We go through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`. We use a constant amount of extra space. The variables `maxProduct`, `minProduct`, and `result` are used to keep track of the required values.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum product of a contiguous subarray while keeping the implementation straightforward.
