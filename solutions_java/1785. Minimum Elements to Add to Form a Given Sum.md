[Leetcode 1785. Minimum Elements to Add to Form a Given Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1785)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers `limit` and `goal`. The array `nums` represents elements with an absolute value up to `limit`. We want to add a minimum number of elements to `nums` such that the sum of `nums` equals `goal`. Each element that can be added should be within the range `[-limit, limit]`.

Return the minimum number of elements you need to add to make the sum of the array equal to `goal`.

### Example:
```text
Input: nums = [1, -1, 1], limit = 3, goal = -4
Output: 2

Input: nums = [1, -10, 9, 1], limit = 100, goal = 0
Output: 1
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `nums` be empty?**
   - Yes, `nums` can be empty.

2. **What are the range constraints on the elements of `nums` and the values of `limit` and `goal`?**
   - Constraints are given that the elements in `nums` lie within `[-1000, 1000]`, `limit` is within `[1, 1000000]`, and `goal` can be a value within `[-10^9, 10^9]`.

3. **Is there a maximum length for `nums`?**
   - Yes, `nums` can have up to `10^5` elements.

### Strategy

The strategy to solve this problem is straightforward:
1. Calculate the current sum of the array `nums`.
2. Determine the difference between the current sum and the `goal`.
3. To minimize the number of elements required, each added element should be as large as possible in magnitude, i.e., `limit`.
4. Calculate how many such elements are necessary to cover the difference.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minElements(int[] nums, int limit, int goal) {
        // Step 1: Calculate the current sum.
        long currentSum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            currentSum += num;
        }
        
        // Step 2: Calculate the difference we need to bridge.
        long diff = Math.abs(goal - currentSum);
        
        // Step 3: Calculate the minimum number of elements needed.
        // We use Math.ceil(diff / (double) limit), but to avoid floating-point computation,
        // we can use (diff + limit - 1) / limit which effectively performs ceiling division.
        return (int)((diff + limit - 1) / limit);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.minElements(new int[]{1, -1, 1}, 3, -4)); // Output: 2
        System.out.println(sol.minElements(new int[]{1, -10, 9, 1}, 100, 0)); // Output: 1
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Calculating current sum:** O(n), where n is the length of the array `nums`.
- **Calculating difference and required steps:** O(1).

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is **O(n)**.
