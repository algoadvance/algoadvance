[Leetcode 3223. Minimum Length of String After Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3223)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. You can perform operations on the string: in one operation, you can remove any one of the characters and any further occurrences of the same character.

Return the minimum length of the string after performing these operations as many times as possible.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: 
   - Is the input string always non-empty?
   - What are the length constraints on the input string `s`?

2. **Output Details**:
   - Should the result be a single integer representing the minimum length?
   
For the sake of this problem, let's assume:
- The input string `s` has a length ranging from 1 to \(10^5\).
- The output is a single integer.

### Strategy
1. **Frequency Count**:
   - First, count the frequency of each character in the string `s`.
   
2. **Odd Frequency Count**:
   - If the frequency of a character is odd, at least one instance of that character must remain in the string after operations.

3. **Sum of Remaining Characters**:
   - Iterate over the frequency counts and add up the frequencies of characters that have an odd count.
   
The problem boils down to summing the frequencies of the characters that appear an odd number of times after we remove all complete pairs (if a character appears an even number of times, it can be fully removed).

### Code
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class MinLengthOfStringAfterOperations {
    public static int minLengthOfString(String s) {
        // Frequency map to count occurrences of each character
        Map<Character, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Populate the frequency map
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            frequencyMap.put(ch, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(ch, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        int minLength = 0;
        
        // Iterate over the frequency map to calculate the minimum length
        for (int count : frequencyMap.values()) {
            if (count % 2 != 0) {
                minLength++;
            }
        }
        
        return minLength;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "aabbccddeeffg";
        System.out.println(minLengthOfString(s));  // Output: 1
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Overall Complexity**: O(N)
    - **Frequency Count**: O(N) where N is the length of the string `s`, because we iterate over the string once to populate the frequency map.
    - **Iterate over Counts**: O(1) on average, because the number of distinct characters (lowercase English letters) is limited to 26.
    
Thus, the solution is efficient and scales linearly with the size of the input string.

This problem shows that efficient use of hashing (frequency counting) is key to solving many string manipulation challenges in competitive programming and interview scenarios.
