[Leetcode 2310. Sum of Numbers With Units Digit K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2310)
### Problem Statement

2310. Sum of Numbers With Units Digit K.

Given two integers num and k, you need to find the sum of all integers from 1 to num that have their units place (last digit) equal to k.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the range inclusive of both 1 and num?**
   - Yes, the range is inclusive of both 1 and num.
2. **What is the range of num and k?**
   - Typically, `1 <= num <= 10^6` and `0 <= k <= 9`.
3. **Should the function return 0 if no such numbers exist?**
   - Yes, if no numbers in the range have k as the unit digit, the function should return 0.

### Strategy
1. **Iterate through the Range**: Loop through all numbers from 1 to `num`.
2. **Check the Units Digit**: For each number, check if its units digit is equal to `k`.
3. **Sum the Valid Numbers**: Maintain a cumulative sum of numbers whose units digit is `k`.

### Code

Let's implement this in Java:

```java
public class SumOfNumbersWithUnitsDigitK {
    public static int sumOfNumbersWithUnitsDigitK(int num, int k) {
        int sum = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
            if (i % 10 == k) {
                sum += i;
            }
        }
        
        return sum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 100;
        int k = 7;
        System.out.println(sumOfNumbersWithUnitsDigitK(num, k)); // Expected output: 385
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **O(num)**: The function iterates from 1 to `num`, checking the units digit of each number and adding it to the sum if it matches `k`. This leads to a time complexity of O(num).

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: Initialize `sum` to `0`.
2. **Loop through Range**: Loop from `1` to `num` (inclusive).
3. **Check Units Digit**: Use the modulus operator (`%`) to determine if the units digit of the current number `i` equals `k`.
4. **Accumulate Sum**: If the units digit matches `k`, add the number to `sum`.
5. **Return Result**: Return the cumulative `sum` after completing the loop.

By following this strategy, the function efficiently calculates the sum of all numbers from `1` to `num` that end in `k`.
