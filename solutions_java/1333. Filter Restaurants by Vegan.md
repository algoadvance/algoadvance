[Leetcode 1333. Filter Restaurants by Vegan](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1333)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of restaurants, where each restaurant is represented by an array `[id, rating, veganFriendly, price, distance]`. You need to filter the restaurants based on the following criteria:
1. **vegan_friendly**: If the user is looking for vegan-friendly restaurants, only include restaurants that are vegan-friendly.
2. **max_price**: Only include restaurants that have a price less than or equal to `max_price`.
3. **max_distance**: Only include restaurants that are within the given `max_distance`.

After filtering the restaurants, you need to sort them by their rating (in descending order). If two restaurants have the same rating, sort them by their `id` (in descending order).

Return the list of restaurant IDs after filtering and sorting.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What are the ranges of the parameters for the restaurants (e.g., rating, price, distance)?
   - Each item in the restaurants list follows the format `[id, rating, veganFriendly, price, distance]`.
   - The constraints usually are provided within the problem statement, but for the sake of implementation, we will assume reasonable ranges (e.g., ratings are between 1 to 5, price and distance are positive).

2. Are there any edge cases like empty restaurants list?
   - Yes, if the list of restaurants is empty, we should return an empty list.

3. In case of conflicting sorting criteria (e.g., same rating and id), how should it be handled?
   - If two restaurants have the same rating, they should be sorted by their `id` in descending order.

### Strategy

1. **Filtering**:
   - Use the given criteria (`vegan_friendly`, `max_price`, and `max_distance`) to filter the list of restaurants.
   
2. **Sorting**:
   - After filtering, sort the resulting list by `rating` in descending order.
   - If two restaurants have the same rating, then sort by `id` in descending order.

3. **Extracting IDs**:
   - Once sorted, extract the IDs of the restaurants to form the final output list.

### Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.Comparator;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> filterRestaurants(int[][] restaurants, int veganFriendly, int maxPrice, int maxDistance) {
        List<int[]> filteredRestaurants = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Step 1: Filter restaurants
        for (int[] restaurant : restaurants) {
            if ((veganFriendly == 0 || restaurant[2] == 1) 
                 && restaurant[3] <= maxPrice 
                 && restaurant[4] <= maxDistance) {
                filteredRestaurants.add(restaurant);
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Sort restaurants
        Collections.sort(filteredRestaurants, new Comparator<int[]>() {
            @Override
            public int compare(int[] r1, int[] r2) {
                if (r2[1] != r1[1]) {
                    return r2[1] - r1[1]; // Sort by rating in descending order
                } else {
                    return r2[0] - r1[0]; // Sort by id in descending order
                }
            }
        });

        // Step 3: Extract restaurant IDs
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int[] restaurant : filteredRestaurants) {
            result.add(restaurant[0]);
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[][] restaurants = {
            {1, 4, 1, 40, 10},
            {2, 8, 0, 50, 5},
            {3, 8, 1, 30, 4},
            {4, 10, 0, 10, 3},
            {5, 1, 1, 15, 1}
        };

        // Example usage:
        List<Integer> filteredIds = solution.filterRestaurants(restaurants, 1, 30, 10);
        System.out.println(filteredIds); // Expected output: [3, 1, 5]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Filtering**: \( O(N) \), where \( N \) is the number of restaurants.
2. **Sorting**: \( O(N \log N) \) due to the sorting step.
3. **Overall Complexity**: The overall time complexity is \( O(N \log N) \).

This approach ensures efficient filtering and sorting, making it well-suited for the given problem constraints.
