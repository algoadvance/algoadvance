[Leetcode 838. Push Dominoes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l838)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `dominoes` representing the initial state where:
- `'.'` represents a domino standing still.
- `'L'` represents a domino that has been pushed to the left.
- `'R'` represents a domino that has been pushed to the right.

Return a string representing the final state after all dominoes have been pushed.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - The string length \( n \) can be up to \( 10^5 \).
    - The string contains only the characters `'.'`, `'L'`, and `'R'`.

2. **Is there a guaranteed solution?**
    - Yes, there will be a deterministic outcome for the domino setup provided.

3. **Can I make any assumptions about the interactions?**
    - Yes, the dominoes will fall until they either hit another domino or reach the end of the string.

### Strategy

1. We'll process the string `dominoes` by simulating the effect of domino pushes over time but do it in a single pass for efficiency.
2. Initialize an array `forces` to keep track of net forces applied on each position in `dominoes`.
3. Traverse the string from left to right and compute forces exerted by dominoes pushed to the right (`'R'`).
4. Traverse the string from right to left and compute forces exerted by dominoes pushed to the left (`'L'`).
5. Combine the forces to determine the final state of each domino:
   - Positive force means the net force is towards the right (`'R'`).
   - Negative force means the net force is towards the left (`'L'`).
   - Zero force means no net push (domino stays `'.'`).

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public String pushDominoes(String dominoes) {
        int n = dominoes.length();
        int[] forces = new int[n];

        // Traversing from left to right
        int force = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (dominoes.charAt(i) == 'R') {
                force = n;  // Reset the force to a high positive number
            } else if (dominoes.charAt(i) == 'L') {
                force = 0;  // Reset the force to zero if 'L'
            } else if (force > 0) {
                force--;  // Decrease the force for continuing 'R'
            }
            forces[i] += force;
        }

        // Traversing from right to left
        force = 0;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (dominoes.charAt(i) == 'L') {
                force = n;  // Reset the force to a high negative number
            } else if (dominoes.charAt(i) == 'R') {
                force = 0;  // Reset the force to zero if 'R'
            } else if (force > 0) {
                force--;  // Decrease the force for continuing 'L'
            }
            forces[i] -= force;
        }

        // Construct final string based on net forces
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (forces[i] > 0) {
                result.append('R');
            } else if (forces[i] < 0) {
                result.append('L');
            } else {
                result.append('.');
            }
        }

        return result.toString();
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \)
  - We traverse the string `dominoes` twice (once from left to right, and once from right to left), each in linear time.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(n) \) for the `forces` array used to store the net forces applied to each position.
