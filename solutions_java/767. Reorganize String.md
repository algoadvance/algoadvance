[Leetcode 767. Reorganize String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l767)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, rearrange the characters of `s` so that any two adjacent characters are not the same.

Return any possible rearrangement of `s` or return an empty string if no such rearrangement is possible.

### Example 1
Input: `s = "aab"`
Output: `"aba"`

### Example 2
Input: `s = "aaab"`
Output: `""`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if it is impossible to rearrange the string to meet the requirement?**
   - You should return an empty string `""`.

2. **Are all characters in the string lowercase English letters?**
   - Yes, the problem can assume that all characters are lowercase English letters (a-z).

3. **What is the maximum length of the input string?**
   - The maximum length of `s` is 500.

## Strategy

1. **Count Character Frequencies:**
   - Use a hash map (or an array of size 26) to count the frequency of each character.

2. **Max Heap for Frequency:**
   - Use a max heap (priority queue) to keep track of characters by their frequencies. The most frequent characters should be at the top.

3. **Rebuild the String:**
   - Repeatedly pull two most frequent characters from the heap and add them to the output string. This ensures that no two adjacent characters are the same.
   - After adding characters to the result, decrease their frequency and if they still have a remaining count, push them back into the heap.

4. **Check for Possibility:**
   - If at any moment the count of a character (while constructing the result) becomes more than half the size of the remaining characters + 1, then it is impossible to rearrange.

## Code

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public class Solution {
    public String reorganizeString(String s) {
        // Character frequency array
        int[] freq = new int[26];
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            freq[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        // Max Heap
        PriorityQueue<int[]> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b[1] - a[1]);
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (freq[i] > 0) {
                if (freq[i] > (s.length() + 1) / 2) {
                    return ""; // Not possible to rearrange
                }
                maxHeap.add(new int[]{i, freq[i]});
            }
        }
        
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        
        // Reorganize the string
        while (maxHeap.size() >= 2) {
            int[] first = maxHeap.poll();
            int[] second = maxHeap.poll();
            
            // Append characters to the result
            result.append((char)(first[0] + 'a'));
            result.append((char)(second[0] + 'a'));
            
            // Decrease frequency and push back into heap if still remaining
            if (--first[1] > 0) maxHeap.add(first);
            if (--second[1] > 0) maxHeap.add(second);
        }
        
        // If one character left in heap
        if (!maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
            int[] last = maxHeap.poll();
            if (last[1] > 1) {
                return ""; // Not possible to rearrange
            }
            result.append((char)(last[0] + 'a'));
        }
        
        return result.toString();
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Counting Frequencies:**
   - This takes O(n), where n is the length of the string.

2. **Building the Max Heap:**
   - We have up to 26 characters, so inserting into and extracting from the max heap operates in O(log 26) which is constant.

3. **Reconstructing the String:**
   - This takes O(n) as we build the final string.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, mostly dominated by the initial counting and the final string reconstruction steps.
