[Leetcode 2897. Apply Operations on Array to Maximize Sum of Squares full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2897)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. In one operation, you can choose any index `i` in `nums` and set `nums[i]` to `nums[i] + 1`. Your goal is to maximize the sum of squares of the array after `k` operations. The sum of squares of an array is defined as the sum of the squares of its elements.

Return the maximum sum of squares possible after exactly `k` operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of values**: What is the range of `nums` and `k`?
   - Typically, array elements can be within the range of integer values. Clarifying the exact range would help but let's assume they are within the constraints of typical LeetCode problems.
   
2. **Duplicates**: Is the array allowed to have duplicate values?
   - Yes. The array can have duplicate values.

3. **Length of the array**: Is there any specific constraint on the length of `nums`?
   - No specific length constraints mentioned, assume it can get very large.

4. **Negative numbers**: Can the array contain negative numbers?
   - Based on the problem context, let's assume all numbers are non-negative.

### Strategy

To maximize the sum of squares, we should focus on increasing the largest number possible after each operation. Here is a step-by-step approach:

1. **Use a Max-Heap**: Since we want to always increment the largest number:
    - Convert the array elements to negative and use a min-heap to simulate a max-heap.
2. **Perform Operations**: 
    - Extract the maximum element (top of the max-heap).
    - Increment it and add it back to the heap.
    - Repeat this for `k` operations.
3. **Calculate Sum of Squares**: After all operations are applied, calculate the sum of squares of the array elements.

### Code

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public class MaximizeSumOfSquares {
    public static int maximizeSumOfSquares(int[] nums, int k) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b - a);

        // Initialize the max-heap
        for (int num : nums) {
            maxHeap.add(num);
        }

        // Apply k operations: increment the largest element
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            int maxElement = maxHeap.poll();
            maxHeap.add(maxElement + 1);
        }

        // Calculate the sum of squares
        int sumOfSquares = 0;
        while (!maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
            int num = maxHeap.poll();
            sumOfSquares += num * num;
        }

        return sumOfSquares;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3};
        int k = 5;
        System.out.println(maximizeSumOfSquares(nums, k)); // Expected output: 43
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Heap Operations**: Inserting into and extracting from a priority queue (heap) both require `O(log n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the heap.
- **Initialization**: We initialize the heap with `n` elements: `O(n log n)`.
- **k Operations**: Each operation of incrementing the maximum element involves removing the max and then re-inserting it into the heap, each requiring `O(log n)`. Therefore, for `k` operations, itâ€™s `O(k log n)`.
- **Sum Calculation**: Calculating the sum of squares involves iterating through the heap elements: `O(n log n)`.

Combining these, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n + k log n + n log n)`, which simplifies to `O((n + k) log n)`.

This solution should effectively handle typical input sizes for competitive programming contests and coding interviews.
