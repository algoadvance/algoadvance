[Leetcode 1725. Number Of Rectangles That Can Form The Largest Square](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1725)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `rectangles` where `rectangles[i] = [li, wi]` represents the length and width of the `i-th` rectangle.

A **square** can be formed with a side length of `k` if `k <= li` and `k <= wi`. The largest possible square has a side length equal to the minimum side length of any rectangle in the array.

Return *the number of rectangles that can form the largest square*.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: rectangles = [[5,8],[3,9],[5,12],[16,5]]
Output: 3
Explanation: The largest squares with side length 5 are formed by the rectangles [5,8], [5,12], and [16,5].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: rectangles = [[2,3],[3,7],[4,3],[3,7]]
Output: 3
```

### Clarifying Questions

Before proceeding with coding, let's clarify some questions to make sure the requirements are clear:
1. Can the rectangles have different orientations (i.e., are [3, 4] and [4, 3] considered the same)?
2. Are there any constraints on the values of `li` and `wi` or the number of rectangles?

### Strategy

1. **Determine the maximum side length**: Iterate through each rectangle and determine the minimum of its sides. Track the maximum of these minimum values, which will be the side length of the largest possible square.
2. **Count the rectangles**: Iterate through the rectangles again to count how many have their minimum side at least as large as the maximum side length identified in step 1.

### Code

Here's the Java implementation:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int countGoodRectangles(int[][] rectangles) {
        int maxSideLength = 0;
        int count = 0;

        // Find the maximum possible side length for a square
        for (int[] rectangle : rectangles) {
            int sideLength = Math.min(rectangle[0], rectangle[1]);
            maxSideLength = Math.max(maxSideLength, sideLength);
        }

        // Count the rectangles that can form the largest square with maxSideLength
        for (int[] rectangle : rectangles) {
            if (Math.min(rectangle[0], rectangle[1]) >= maxSideLength) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of rectangles. This is because we make two passes over the input array:
1. The first pass to find the maximum possible side length.
2. The second pass to count the rectangles that can form the largest square.

The space complexity is `O(1)` as we are using only a few extra variables.

This approach ensures we efficiently determine the correct number of rectangles that can form the largest possible square.
