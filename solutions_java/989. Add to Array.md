[Leetcode 989. Add to Array full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l989)
### Problem Statement

Given a non-negative integer represented as a non-empty array of digits (`num`), and a non-negative integer `k`, return the array-form of the integer `num + k`.

The array-form of an integer is an array representing its digits in left-to-right order.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: num = [1,2,0,0], k = 34
Output: [1,2,3,4]
Explanation: 1200 + 34 = 1234
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: num = [2,7,4], k = 181
Output: [4,5,5]
Explanation: 274 + 181 = 455
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: num = [2,1,5], k = 806
Output: [1,0,2,1]
Explanation: 215 + 806 = 1021
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the maximum length of the array `num`?
2. Can `k` be a very large number, or is there a constraint on its size?
3. Are there any leading zeros in the `num` array?
4. Is the input always valid (e.g., `num` is a non-empty array and `k` is a non-negative number)?

Assuming the constraints based on typical LeetCode problems:
- The length of `num` and the value of `k` can be quite large.

### Strategy

1. We will iterate through the array from the last digit to the first because addition starts from the least significant digit (rightmost).
2. Add `k` to the number represented by `num` starting from the least significant digit.
3. Manage carry-over if the sum of a position exceeds 9.
4. If after processing all digits, there remains a carry, it needs to be added at the beginning of the resulting list.
5. Convert the list back to array-form to return.

### Code

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> addToArrayForm(int[] num, int k) {
        LinkedList<Integer> result = new LinkedList<>();
        int i = num.length - 1;
        int carry = 0;
        
        while (i >= 0 || k > 0) {
            int digit = carry;
            
            if (i >= 0) {
                digit += num[i];
                i--;
            }
            
            if (k > 0) {
                digit += k % 10;
                k /= 10;
            }
            
            carry = digit / 10;
            result.addFirst(digit % 10);
        }
        
        if (carry > 0) {
            result.addFirst(carry);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(\max(N, \log_{10}K))\), where `N` is the length of the `num` array and `\log_{10}K` is the number of digits in `k`. This is because we process each digit of both `num` and `k`.

This solution ensures that the problem is handled efficiently and correctly even when `num` and `k` are large.
