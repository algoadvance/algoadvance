[Leetcode 946. Validate Stack Sequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l946)
## Problem Statement

The problem "946. Validate Stack Sequences" on LeetCode is defined as follows:

Given two integer arrays `pushed` and `popped` each with distinct values, you need to return `true` if this could have been the result of a sequence of push and pop operations on an initially empty stack, or `false` otherwise.

### Example 1:
```
Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,5,3,2,1]
Output: true
Explanation: We might do the following sequence:
push(1), push(2), push(3), push(4), pop() -> 4,
push(5), pop() -> 5, pop() -> 3, pop() -> 2, pop() -> 1
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: pushed = [1,2,3,4,5], popped = [4,3,5,1,2]
Output: false
Explanation: 1 cannot be popped before 2.
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= pushed.length == popped.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= pushed[i], popped[i] < 1000`
- `pushed` is a permutation of `popped`.
- `pushed` and `popped` have distinct values.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are both `pushed` and `popped` valid permutations of each other?
   - Yes, based on the constraints.
   
2. Should the solution handle arbitrary large input sizes?
   - No, the constraints limit the size up to 1000, so the solution should be optimized accordingly but doesn't need to accommodate extremely large sizes.

## Strategy

To validate if the given `pushed` and `popped` sequences can represent a valid sequence of stack operations:

1. **Initialize a Stack**: Use a stack to simulate the push and pop operations.
2. **Iterate through `pushed` Array**: For each element in the `pushed` array, push the element onto the stack.
3. **Check `popped` Array**: After each push, check if the top of the stack matches the next element in the `popped` array.
4. If they match, keep popping elements from the stack until they no longer match.
5. **Final Check**: If all elements are appropriately matched, the stack should be empty at the end of the iteration, implying that the sequence is valid.

### Pseudocode:

- Initialize an empty stack.
- Initialize an index `j` to 0 to keep track of the position in `popped` array.
- Loop through each element `x` in `pushed`:
    - Push `x` to the stack.
    - While the stack is not empty and the top of the stack equals `popped[j]`:
        - Pop from the stack.
        - Increment `j`.
- After the loop, check if the stack is empty.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the pushed/popped array. Each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- Space complexity is also O(N) for the stack.

## Code Implementation

```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class ValidateStackSequences {
    public boolean validateStackSequences(int[] pushed, int[] popped) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        int j = 0; // pointer for popped

        for (int x : pushed) {
            stack.push(x);
            // Pop elements from the stack if they match the current popped element
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() == popped[j]) {
                stack.pop();
                j++;
            }
        }

        // If the stack is empty, it means we were able to match all elements
        return stack.isEmpty();
    }
    
    // Main method for quick testing
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ValidateStackSequences validator = new ValidateStackSequences();

        // Example 1
        int[] pushed1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int[] popped1 = {4, 5, 3, 2, 1};
        System.out.println(validator.validateStackSequences(pushed1, popped1)); // Should print true

        // Example 2
        int[] pushed2 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int[] popped2 = {4, 3, 5, 1, 2};
        System.out.println(validator.validateStackSequences(pushed2, popped2)); // Should print false
    }
}
```

The code provided should cover the requirements of the problem and works efficiently within the given constraints.
