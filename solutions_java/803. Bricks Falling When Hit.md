[Leetcode 803. Bricks Falling When Hit](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l803)
### Problem Statement:

You are given an m x n binary grid, where each 1 represents a brick, and each 0 represents an empty space. A brick is stable if one of the following conditions is met:
- It is directly connected to the top of the grid.
- At least one other brick in its four adjoining cells (left, right, top, and bottom) is stable. 

You are also given an array `hits`, where `hits[i] = [rowi, coli]` represents that the brick at `(rowi, coli)` is being hit. You need to return an array representing the number of bricks that will fall after each hit. 

If a brick is not present at `hits[i]`, the cell becomes an empty space and it doesn't affect any bricks. 

**Example:**
```
Input: grid = [[1,0,0,0],[1,1,1,0]], hits = [[1,0]]
Output: [2]
```

**Constraints:**
1. `m == grid.length`
2. `n == grid[i].length`
3. `1 <= m, n <= 200`
4. `1 <= hits.length <= 4 * 10^4`
5. `hits[i].length == 2`
6. `0 <= xi <= m - 1`
7. `0 <= yi <= n - 1`
8. All `(xi, yi)` are unique.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Do we have to handle the scenario when a hit points to an empty cell?**  
   - Yes, if a hit lands on an empty cell, it doesn't affect any bricks and the count is zero for that hit.

2. **Should we modify the grid as we process the hits?**  
   - Yes, every hit should be processed in order, and the grid should be updated accordingly.

### Strategy:

**Union-Find Approach:**
The solution involves the Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to efficiently manage and connect components of bricks in the grid.

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - Convert the hits into a state change by marking the positions where bricks are intended to be hit.
   
2. **Connect Stable Bricks:**
   - Start from the modified grid (post-hits) to mark stable bricks and connect them using union-find to identify connected components.

3. **Reverse Hits:**
   - Process hits in reverse order to determine how adding a brick back influences the stability of other bricks.
   - If a hit position is an actual brick (originally), attempt to reconnect it and determine how many bricks will become stable as a result.

### Code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class BricksFallingWhenHit {
    int[] parent, size;
    int rows, cols;

    public int[] hitBricks(int[][] grid, int[][] hits) {
        rows = grid.length;
        cols = grid[0].length;
        parent = new int[rows * cols + 1];
        size = new int[rows * cols + 1];
        Arrays.fill(size, 1);

        for (int i = 0; i < parent.length; i++) {
            parent[i] = i;
        }

        for (int[] hit : hits) {
            if (grid[hit[0]][hit[1]] == 1) {
                grid[hit[0]][hit[1]] = 2; // Mark bricks to be removed
            }
        }

        // Connect first row bricks to the virtual top
        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            if (grid[0][j] == 1) {
                union(j, rows * cols);
            }
        }

        // Connect all other bricks
        for (int i = 1; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    if (grid[i-1][j] == 1) union(i * cols + j, (i-1) * cols + j);
                    if (j > 0 && grid[i][j-1] == 1) union(i * cols + j, i * cols + j - 1);
                }
            }
        }

        int[] result = new int[hits.length];
        int[][] directions = {{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};

        for (int k = hits.length - 1; k >= 0; k--) {
            int x = hits[k][0], y = hits[k][1];
            if (grid[x][y] == 2) {
                int prevTop = size[find(rows * cols)];
                grid[x][y] = 1;

                for (int[] dir : directions) {
                    int nx = x + dir[0], ny = y + dir[1];
                    if (nx >= 0 && ny >= 0 && nx < rows && ny < cols && grid[nx][ny] == 1) {
                        union(x * cols + y, nx * cols + ny);
                    }
                }

                if (x == 0) {
                    union(y, rows * cols);
                }

                int newTop = size[find(rows * cols)];
                result[k] = Math.max(0, newTop - prevTop - 1);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

    private int find(int x) {
        if (x != parent[x]) parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        return parent[x];
    }

    private void union(int x, int y) {
        int rootX = find(x), rootY = find(y);
        if (rootX != rootY) {
            if (size[rootX] >= size[rootY]) {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
                size[rootX] += size[rootY];
            } else {
                parent[rootX] = rootY;
                size[rootY] += size[rootX];
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- Building Union-Find structure: O(m * n)
- Processing hits in reverse: O(L * α(m * n)), where L is the number of hits and α is the inverse Ackermann function, which is nearly constant.

The provided solution efficiently handles large grids and numerous hits using the Union-Find data structure to keep track of connected components and stability of bricks. The solution processes the grid in a way that respects the connectivity constraints and updates the state dynamically by reversing the hits.
