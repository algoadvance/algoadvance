[Leetcode 2934. Minimum Operations to Maximize Last Elements in Arrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2934)
### Problem Statement

Given N arrays where each array initially contains a single positive integer and an integer `x`, you can perform operations to maximize the last element in each array. The operations allowed are:
1. Choose any array and append the element `x` to it.
2. Choose any array and append the last element of any other array to it.

The goal is to find the minimum number of operations to ensure that all arrays have the same last element as their maximum possible value. 

Let's denote these arrays as `A1, A2, ..., AN`. Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the value of `N` or `x`?
   - Assumption 1: `N` is the number of arrays, and `1 <= N <= 1000`.
   - Assumption 2: `1 <= x <= 1000`.
   
2. **Initial Values**: Can the initial values in the arrays be any positive integer?
   - Yes, the initial values are arbitrary positive integers.

3. **Output**: Should the output be a single integer representing the minimum number of operations?
   - Yes, output the minimum number of operations. 

### Strategy

To find the minimum number of operations to ensure all arrays have the same last element, we can use the following approach:

1. **Identify Maximum Value**: Determine the maximum value among the last elements in all arrays.
2. **Count Steps to Equalize**:
   - For each array, compute how many operations are needed to match the maximum value.
   - The operations required would either be incrementing the current value by repeatedly adding `x` or setting the desired value directly through other arrays' last elements.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MinimumOperations {
    public static int minOperations(int N, int x, int[] arr) {
        // Step 1: Identify the maximum value among last elements
        int maxValue = arr[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < N; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > maxValue) {
                maxValue = arr[i];
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Calculate the required operations to make all arrays' last elements equal to maxValue
        int totalOperations = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            int difference = maxValue - arr[i];
            totalOperations += difference / x;
            if (difference % x != 0) {
                totalOperations++;
            }
        }

        return totalOperations;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage:
        int N = 3;
        int x = 2;
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3}; // Initial values in arrays

        int result = minOperations(N, x, arr);
        System.out.println("Minimum operations required: " + result); // Output should match the required minimum operations
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this code is O(N), where N is the number of arrays. This is primarily because we need to:
1. Iterate over the array once to find the maximum value (O(N)).
2. Iterate over the array once again to compute the number of operations for each element (O(N)).

So the overall time complexity is O(N).
