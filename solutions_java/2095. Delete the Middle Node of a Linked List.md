[Leetcode 2095. Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2095)
### Problem Statement

You are given the head of a linked list. Delete the middle node, and return the head of the modified linked list.

The middle node can be calculated as follows: if there are `n` nodes in the linked list, the middle node is the `(n // 2)`-th node (0-indexed, where `//` represents integer division). For example, if there are `5` nodes, the middle node is the `2`nd node.

You must solve this problem in `O(n)` time complexity, where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if the linked list is empty?**
    - If the linked list is empty, we should return `null`.

2. **What should be done if the linked list has only one node?**
    - If the linked list has only one node, deleting the middle node would result in an empty linked list, so we should return `null`.

3. **Should the input be mutated or should we return a new list?**
    - The problem asks to modify the original list and return it.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we can use the two-pointer technique to identify the middle node efficiently:

1. **Initialize Two Pointers**:
   - Use two pointers: `slow` and `fast`. Both start at the head of the list.

2. **Move Pointers**:
   - Move `slow` by one step and `fast` by two steps in each iteration. When `fast` reaches the end of the list, `slow` will be at the middle node.

3. **Delete the Middle Node**:
   - Keep track of the node before the `slow` pointer (`prev`). When `slow` is at the middle node, set `prev.next = slow.next` to bypass the middle node.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the linked list is empty, return `null`.
   - If the list has only one node, return `null`.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of the approach is `O(n)` since we traverse the list to find the middle node.
- The space complexity is `O(1)` as we are using a constant amount of space.

### Code

Here's the Java code implementing the above strategy:

```java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode() {}
    ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
    ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
}

public class Solution {
    public ListNode deleteMiddle(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) {
            return null; // Empty list or only one element
        }

        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;
        ListNode prev = null;

        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            prev = slow;
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }

        // slow is now pointing to the middle node
        if (prev != null) {
            prev.next = slow.next;
        }

        return head;
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initial Checks**:
    - If the list is empty or has only one node, return `null`.

2. **Initialization**:
    - Initialize `slow`, `fast`, and `prev`.

3. **Two-pointer Traversal**:
    - Move `slow` one step and `fast` two steps in each iteration.
    - Track the node before the `slow` pointer with `prev`.

4. **Deletion**:
    - Once the loop ends, `slow` is at the middle node. Set `prev.next` to `slow.next` to delete the current `slow` node.

5. **Return**:
    - Return the modified linked list starting from `head`.

With this approach, you can efficiently delete the middle node of a linked list in `O(n)` time while using `O(1)` additional space.
