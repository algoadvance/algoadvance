[Leetcode 1657. Determine if Two Strings Are Close](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1657)
### Problem Statement
Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, you want to determine if you can transform `word1` into `word2` using the following operations any number of times:

1. Swap any two existing characters.
2. Transform every occurrence of one existing character into another existing character, and do the same with the other character.

Two strings are considered "close" if and only if:
- They have the same characters.
- They can be transformed to each other by swapping characters or transforming characters as described above.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input constraints**: What is the maximum length of the input strings?
2. **Character set**: Can the strings contain special characters or are they limited to lowercase alphabets?
3. **Edge cases**: Should the case where either of the strings is empty be considered?

### Strategy
1. **Frequency Check**: Both strings must have the same set of unique characters.
2. **Frequency Distribution**: The frequency of each character in `word1` and `word2` when sorted must be identical. This ensures that the characters can be rearranged to match up properly.

### Implementation

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class TwoStringsClose {
    public boolean closeStrings(String word1, String word2) {
        if (word1.length() != word2.length()) {
            return false;
        }
        
        int[] count1 = new int[26];
        int[] count2 = new int[26];
        boolean[] unique1 = new boolean[26];
        boolean[] unique2 = new boolean[26];
        
        for (char c : word1.toCharArray()) {
            count1[c - 'a']++;
            unique1[c - 'a'] = true;
        }
        
        for (char c : word2.toCharArray()) {
            count2[c - 'a']++;
            unique2[c - 'a'] = true;
        }
        
        // Check if both strings have the same set of unique characters
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (unique1[i] != unique2[i]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        // Check if the frequency distributions, when sorted, are the same
        Arrays.sort(count1);
        Arrays.sort(count2);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (count1[i] != count2[i]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Counting Frequencies**: O(n) for both `word1` and `word2` where `n` is the length of the strings.
2. **Sorting Frequency Arrays**: O(26 log 26), which is essentially O(1) since the size of the alphabet is constant.
3. **Overall**: The overall time complexity is O(n), which is efficient given the constraints.

This solution ensures that both the frequency of individual characters and the presence of specific characters is considered, enabling accurate checking of whether two strings can be made "close".
