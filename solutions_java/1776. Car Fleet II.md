[Leetcode 1776. Car Fleet II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1776)
### Problem Statement

You are given `n` cars that are traveling at the same speed initially but each car has its own unique position and deceleration rate. For each car, you are given its initial position `position[i]` and its base deceleration rate `rate[i]`. Each car also has a speed `v` at which it is traveling. Your task is to simulate the race and find out if a car ever catches up to another one in front of it, forming a car fleet. 

The problem is to find the time at which each car meets the car ahead of it or never, in which case the answer should be `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Cars Interaction**: Do cars affect each other in terms of speed and behavior upon meeting?
   - **Answer**: Yes, once a car catches up to the car in front of it, they can be regarded as moving together at the same speed.
   
2. **Output Format**: How should the result be formatted?
   - **Answer**: The result should be an array where the i-th element indicates the time it takes for the i-th car to meet the next car in front of it. If the i-th car never meets the next car, return `-1` for that position.
   
3. **Initial Speed**: Are all cars traveling at the same initial speed `v`?
   - **Answer**: Assuming they have different speeds (potentially implying loosely that their deceleration rates affect how quickly they slow down).

### Strategy

1. **Preprocessing**: Begin by ensuring the cars are processed in the order of their positions (sorted from the closest to the start line to the farthest).
2. **Stack-based Approach**: Use a stack to keep track of the leading car fleets. Process each car and determine its time to contact with the next car.
3. **Mathematical Calculation**: For two cars `i` and `j`:
   - Determine meeting time using their relative speeds and positions.
   - For cars `i` and `j`, using `t = (position[j] - position[i]) / (speed[i] - speed[j])` if `speed[i] > speed[j]` (positions are given in sorted order).
   
### Code

Here's the Java implementation for the given strategy:

```java
public class CarFleetII {
    public double[] getCollisionTimes(int[][] cars) {
        int n = cars.length;
        double[] result = new double[n];
        Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        
        // Initialize result array with -1 indicating no possible meeting
        Arrays.fill(result, -1);
        
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; --i) {
            int p = cars[i][0], s = cars[i][1];
            
            // Process the stack to find valid collision times
            while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
                int j = stack.peek();  // Get the front car index from the stack
                int pj = cars[j][0], sj = cars[j][1];
                
                // If the current car does not catch the front car, or if the front car catches another car first
                if (sj >= s || (result[j] > 0 && (pj - p) / (double)(s - sj) >= result[j])) {
                    stack.pop();
                } else {
                    break;
                }
            }
            
            // Compute the collision time if stack is not empty after processing
            if (!stack.isEmpty()) {
                int j = stack.peek();
                result[i] = (cars[j][0] - p) / (double)(s - cars[j][1]);
            }
            
            // Push the current car onto the stack
            stack.push(i);
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CarFleetII fleet = new CarFleetII();
        int[][] cars = {{1, 2}, {2, 1}, {4, 3}, {7, 2}};
        double[] times = fleet.getCollisionTimes(cars);
        
        for (double t : times) {
            System.out.println(t);
        }
    }
}
```
### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The solution iterates through each car once, and each car is processed in the stack potentially multiple times, leading to an amortized O(n) complexity due to the stack-based approach.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the stack and results array, making the space complexity linear in relation to the number of cars.
