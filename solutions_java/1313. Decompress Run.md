[Leetcode 1313. Decompress Run](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1313)
### Problem Statement

1313. Decompress Run-Length Encoded List

We are given a run-length encoded list `nums`. Consider each adjacent pair of elements `[freq, val] = [nums[2*i], nums[2*i+1]]` (with `i >= 0`). For each such pair, there are `freq` elements with value `val` concatenated in a sublist. Concatenate all the sublists from left to right to generate the decompressed list.

Return the decompressed list.

#### Example
- Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4]`
- Output: `[2,4,4,4]`

#### Constraints
- `2 <= nums.length <= 100`
- `nums.length % 2 == 0`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input type:**
   - Are `nums` always positive integers? 
     - Yes, based on the constraints `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`.

2. **Output type:**
   - Should the output be a list of integers? 
     - Yes, it should be a list of integers, where each integer appears its respective frequency number of times.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate over the list `nums`:**
   - The length of `nums` is always even, and we will iterate through pairs of elements.
   
2. **Decompose each pair:**
   - For each pair `[freq, val]`, generate a sublist containing `freq` instances of `val`.

3. **Concatenate all sublists:**
   - Collect all these generated lists into a single result list.

### Code

Here is the Java implementation for the problem:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public int[] decompressRLElist(int[] nums) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Iterate over the pairs in the input array
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i += 2) {
            int freq = nums[i];
            int val = nums[i+1];
            
            // Add 'val' to the result 'freq' times
            for (int j = 0; j < freq; j++) {
                result.add(val);
            }
        }
        
        // Convert the list to an array
        int[] decompressedList = new int[result.size()];
        for (int i = 0; i < result.size(); i++) {
            decompressedList[i] = result.get(i);
        }
        
        return decompressedList;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - We iterate over the input array `nums` of length `n` once.
  - For each pair, we generate exactly `freq` number of elements, ensuring linear traversal of the list input.

- **Space Complexity:** O(m)
  - The space complexity is proportional to the output list size `m`, which is the total number of elements generated from the run-length encoded list.
