[Leetcode 33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l33)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (not necessarily with distinct values), and an integer `target`. Suppose `nums` is rotated at some pivot unknown to you beforehand (i.e., `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`).

Given the array `nums` after the rotation and an integer `target`, return the index of `target` if it is in `nums`, or `-1` if it is not in `nums`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

*Example 1:*
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 0
Output: 4
```

*Example 2:*
```
Input: nums = [4,5,6,7,0,1,2], target = 3
Output: -1
```

*Example 3:*
```
Input: nums = [1], target = 0
Output: -1
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Q:** Could the array be rotated at any index?
   * **A:** Yes, the array can be rotated at any index.
   
2. **Q:** Are there any duplicates in the array?
   * **A:** No, the array does not contain duplicate values as per the problem definition for this variant.

### Strategy:
The problem requires an `O(log n)` runtime complexity, which suggests a binary search approach. We can modify the standard binary search to handle the rotation:

1. **Identify the mid-point**:
   - If the `mid` element is equal to the target, return the mid index.

2. **Determine which part of the array is sorted**:
   - If the left part (`nums[left]` to `nums[mid]`) is sorted:
     - Check if the target is within this range.
   - Otherwise, the right part (`nums[mid]` to `nums[right]`) must be sorted:
     - Check if the target is within this range.

3. **Adjust the search range** based on the sorted part and target position:
   - If the target lies within the range of the sorted part, adjust the `left` or `right` pointers accordingly.

### Code:
```java
public class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            
            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return mid;
            }
            
            // Determine if the left half is sorted
            if (nums[left] <= nums[mid]) {
                // Target is in the left sorted part
                if (nums[left] <= target && target < nums[mid]) {
                    right = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    left = mid + 1;
                }
            }
            // Otherwise, the right half must be sorted
            else {
                // Target is in the right sorted part
                if (nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[right]) {
                    left = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    right = mid - 1;
                }
            }
        }

        return -1; // Target not found
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the algorithm is `O(log n)`, as each step effectively halves the search range, characteristic of binary search.
