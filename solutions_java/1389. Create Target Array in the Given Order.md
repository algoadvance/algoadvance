[Leetcode 1389. Create Target Array in the Given Order](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1389)
### Problem Statement

Given two arrays of integers `nums` and `index`. Your task is to create a target array under the following rules:

- Initially, the target array is empty.
- From left to right, read each element from `nums` and its corresponding index from `index`.
- Insert the element from `nums` at the position given by `index`.

Return the target array.

It is guaranteed that the insertion positions will be valid.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - `nums.length == index.length`
   - Both `nums` and `index` are non-empty arrays.
   - The arrays could have up to 100 elements (`1 <= nums.length, index.length <= 100`).

2. **Output:**
   - Return an array that is formed by inserting the elements of `nums` at positions defined by `index`.

### Example

```plaintext
Input: nums = [0,1,2,3,4], index = [0,1,2,2,1]
Output: [0,4,1,3,2]
Explanation:
nums       index     target
0          0         [0]
1          1         [0,1]
2          2         [0,1,2]
3          2         [0,1,3,2]
4          1         [0,4,1,3,2]
```

### Strategy

1. Initialize an empty list `target`.
2. Iterate through pairs of elements from `nums` and `index`.
3. For each pair, insert the element from `nums` at the specified position from `index` into the `target` list.
4. Convert the list `target` to an array and return it.

### Time Complexity

- **Insertion Operation Complexity:** Each insertion operation in a list in Java can take up to `O(n)` time in the worst case, where `n` is the number of elements in the list at the time of insertion.
- **Total Time Complexity:** For `n` insertions, the time complexity will be `O(n^2)`.

### Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public int[] createTargetArray(int[] nums, int[] index) {
        List<Integer> target = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            target.add(index[i], nums[i]);
        }

        // Convert the target list to array
        int[] result = new int[target.size()];
        for (int i = 0; i < target.size(); i++) {
            result[i] = target.get(i);
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
        int[] index = {0, 1, 2, 2, 1};

        int[] result = sol.createTargetArray(nums, index);
        for (int num : result) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

This code snippet defines a `Solution` class with a method `createTargetArray` taking two integer arrays `nums` and `index`, and produces the desired target array following the insertion rules specified in the problem. The main method also includes an example to demonstrate the usage of the function.
