[Leetcode 1296. Divide Array in Sets of K Consecutive Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1296)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and a positive integer `k`, check whether it is possible to divide this array into sets of `k` consecutive numbers. 

### Example:
1. **Input**: `nums = [1,2,3,3,4,4,5,6]`, `k = 4`
   - **Output**: `true`
2. **Input**: `nums = [3,3,2,2,1,1]`, `k = 2`
   - **Output**: `true`
3. **Input**: `nums = [1,2,3,4]`, `k = 3`
   - **Output**: `false`

If it is possible, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Are the elements in `nums` guaranteed to be non-negative?\
   **A**: No specific guarantee, assume they could be any integers.

2. **Q**: Can `nums` contain duplicates?\
   **A**: Yes.

3. **Q**: What is the maximum size of the `nums` array and value of `k`?\
   **A**: Assume `nums` can have a length up to \(10^5\) and `k` will be a positive integer within reasonable limits for standard operations.

## Strategy

1. **Frequency Map**: Create a frequency map to count occurrences of each number in the array.

2. **Sort and Process**: Sort the unique numbers and attempt to build consecutive sets from the smallest numbers available using the frequency map.

3. **Partition Check**: For each unique number, if it can contribute to a set of `k` consecutive numbers, reduce those counts appropriately, otherwise return `false`.

### Steps:
1. **Frequency Map Creation**: Use a `HashMap` to count occurrences of each number.
2. **Sort the Keys**: Sort the keys of the map.
3. **Set Construction**: Iterate through the sorted keys and attempt to create sets of `k` consecutive numbers. Reduce the current frequency and any frequencies of the next `k-1` consecutive numbers for each successful set creation.

### Detailed Execution:

1. If the total number of elements in the array is not divisible by `k`, it's impossible to partition.
2. Create a frequency map.
3. Sort the keys of this frequency map.
4. For each key in the sorted list, try to decrement the frequency of it and the next `k-1` numbers, ensuring each required number has sufficient count.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public boolean isPossibleDivide(int[] nums, int k) {
        if (nums.length % k != 0) {
            return false;
        }
        
        Map<Integer, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Fill the frequency map
        for (int num : nums) {
            frequencyMap.put(num, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        // Get the sorted unique keys
        List<Integer> uniqueNumbers = new ArrayList<>(frequencyMap.keySet());
        Collections.sort(uniqueNumbers);
        
        // Try to construct sets of k consecutive numbers
        for (int num : uniqueNumbers) {
            int count = frequencyMap.get(num);
            if (count > 0) {
                // Check if we can create a set starting at num
                for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
                    int current = num + i;
                    int frequency = frequencyMap.getOrDefault(current, 0);
                    if (frequency < count) {
                        return false;
                    }
                    frequencyMap.put(current, frequency - count);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Frequency Map Construction**: \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of array `nums`.
2. **Sorting Unique Numbers**: \( O(m \log m) \), where \( m \) is the number of unique numbers in `nums`.
3. **Set Construction**: \( O(m \cdot k) \).

Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step: \( O(m \log m) \).

The space complexity is \( O(n) \) due to the frequency map storage.
