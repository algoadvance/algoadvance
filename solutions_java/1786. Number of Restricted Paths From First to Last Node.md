[Leetcode 1786. Number of Restricted Paths From First to Last Node](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1786)
### Problem Statement

You are given an undirected weighted connected graph containing `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n` and `m` edges. The nodes are represented by integers from `1` to `n`. You are also given an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [u, v, w]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `u` and `v` with weight `w`.

A path is a sequence of nodes such that there is an edge between every consecutive node in the sequence. The distance of a path is the sum of the weights on the edges of the path. A restricted path is a path that starts from node `1` and ends at node `n` and has the following property: for every pair of consecutive nodes in the path, if node `u` precedes node `v`, then the distance from node `v` to node `n` is strictly less than the distance from node `u` to node `n`.

Return the number of restricted paths from node `1` to node `n`. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Number of nodes, `n`: `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4`
   - Number of edges, `m`: `0 <= m <= 5 * 10^4`
   - Edge weights, `w`: `1 <= w <= 10^5`
   - All edges are undirected.
   - The graph is connected, so there is at least one path between any two nodes.

2. **Graph Representation:**
   - Would the edges contain duplicate nodes and weights? Yes, but it's considered a connected graph.

3. **Returned Value:**
   - The number of restricted paths from node `1` to node `n`.

### Strategy

**Step-by-step Approach:**

1. **Shortest Distance from Each Node to Node `n`:**
   - Use Dijkstra's Algorithm starting from node `n` to determine the shortest path from every node to node `n`.

2. **Count Restricted Paths:**
   - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) with memoization to count the number of restricted paths from `1` to `n`. For this, we will only traverse paths that satisfy the restricted path condition.

3. **Data Structures:**
   - Priority Queue (min-heap) for Dijkstra's Algorithm to maintain the minimum distance nodes.
   - Adjacency list to represent the graph.
   - Memoization map to store the number of restricted paths from node `i` to node `n`.

4. **Modulus Operation:**
   - As the number of paths can be large, return the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class NumberOfRestrictedPaths {
    private static final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;

    public int countRestrictedPaths(int n, int[][] edges) {
        // Convert the edge list to an adjacency list
        Map<Integer, List<int[]>> graph = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            graph.put(i, new ArrayList<>());
        }
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            graph.get(edge[0]).add(new int[] { edge[1], edge[2] });
            graph.get(edge[1]).add(new int[] { edge[0], edge[2] });
        }

        // Dijkstra's algorithm to find shortest path from node `n` to all other nodes
        int[] dist = new int[n + 1];
        Arrays.fill(dist, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        dist[n] = 0;
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[1]));
        pq.offer(new int[] { n, 0 });

        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            int[] curr = pq.poll();
            int u = curr[0], d = curr[1];
            if (d > dist[u]) continue;
            for (int[] neighbor : graph.get(u)) {
                int v = neighbor[0], w = neighbor[1];
                if (dist[u] + w < dist[v]) {
                    dist[v] = dist[u] + w;
                    pq.offer(new int[] { v, dist[v] });
                }
            }
        }

        // Perform DFS from node 1 to node n using memoization
        Map<Integer, Integer> memo = new HashMap<>();
        return dfs(1, n, graph, dist, memo);
    }

    private int dfs(int node, int n, Map<Integer, List<int[]>> graph, int[] dist, Map<Integer, Integer> memo) {
        if (node == n) return 1;
        if (memo.containsKey(node)) return memo.get(node);

        int count = 0;
        for (int[] neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
            int v = neighbor[0];
            if (dist[node] > dist[v]) {
                count = (count + dfs(v, n, graph, dist, memo)) % MOD;
            }
        }
        memo.put(node, count);
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NumberOfRestrictedPaths solution = new NumberOfRestrictedPaths();
        int[][] edges = { {1, 2, 3}, {2, 3, 4}, {3, 4, 5}, {1, 4, 6} };
        int result = solution.countRestrictedPaths(4, edges);
        System.out.println(result);  // Output: Number of restricted paths
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** \( O((n + m) \log n) \)
- **DFS with Memoization:** \( O(n + m) \)

### Overall Complexity
Combining both, the overall time complexity is \( O((n + m) \log n) \).
This ensures the solution is efficient even for the upper constraints of the problem.
