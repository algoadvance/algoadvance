[Leetcode 1671. Minimum Number of Removals to Make Mountain Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1671)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return the minimum number of elements to remove to make `nums` *a mountain array*. 

A mountain array is an array that satisfies the following conditions:

- `nums.length >= 3`
- There exists some index `i` (0-indexed) with `0 < i < nums.length - 1` such that:
  - `nums[0] < nums[1] < ... < nums[i - 1] < nums[i]`
  - `nums[i] > nums[i + 1] > ... > nums[nums.length - 1]`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the constraints on the elements in the array? Specifically, are there any bounds on the values of elements?
   - Are there any guaranteed properties like distinct elements?

2. **Output Constraints:**
   - Can the output be zero? Specifically, is the array always guaranteed to be non-mountain initially?

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach with the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) and Longest Decreasing Subsequence (LDS).

1. **Calculate the LIS and LDS:**
   - For each element in the array, calculate the LIS up to that element.
   - Similarly, calculate the LDS starting from each element.

2. **Identify potential peaks:**
   - A valid peak is an index `i` where both LIS[i] > 1 and LDS[i] > 1.

3. **Determine the minimum number of removals:**
   - For each valid peak, calculate the maximum length of a valid mountain array.
   - The number of removals required will be the total length of the array minus this maximum mountain length.

## Code

Here is the Java code to implement the above strategy:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minimumMountainRemovals(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;

        // Calculate LIS
        int[] lis = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(lis, 1);
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                    lis[i] = Math.max(lis[i], lis[j] + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        // Calculate LDS
        int[] lds = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(lds, 1);
        for (int i = n-2; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = n-1; j > i; j--) {
                if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                    lds[i] = Math.max(lds[i], lds[j] + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        // Find the maximum mountain length
        int maxMountainLen = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (lis[i] > 1 && lds[i] > 1) {
                maxMountainLen = Math.max(maxMountainLen, lis[i] + lds[i] - 1);
            }
        }

        // Minimum removals to form the mountain array
        return n - maxMountainLen;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **LIS and LDS Calculation:**
  - The LIS and LDS computation involves nested loops, leading to O(n^2) for each.

- **Overall Complexity:**
  - The overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(n^2), where `n` is the length of the `nums` array.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is O(n) for storing the `lis` and `lds` arrays.
