[Leetcode 1003. Check If Word Is Valid After Substitutions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1003)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, determine if it is valid. The string `s` is valid if it can be formed by repeatedly appending the string "abc" to itself any number of times, deleting substrings "abc", or replacing the substrings that are equal to "abc".

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Clarification on Input Constraints**:
    - **Q**: What are the constraints on the length of `s`?
    - **A**: The length of `s` can go up to 2 * 10^4.
    
2. **Clarification on Characters**:
    - **Q**: Are there any other characters in `s` besides 'a', 'b', and 'c'?
    - **A**: No, `s` only contains the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.

3. **Valid Transformation**:
    - **Q**: Is `s` valid if it is initially an empty string?
    - **A**: Yes, an empty string is considered valid because it can be seen as the result of deleting all "abc" substrings.

### Strategy

1. Utilize a stack to verify if the string is valid.
2. Traverse through the characters of the string `s`:
    - For each character, push it onto the stack.
    - After pushing, check if the top three characters in the stack form the substring "abc":
        - If they do, pop them from the stack.
3. After processing all characters, the stack should be empty if the string is valid.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Stack;

class Solution {
    public boolean isValid(String s) {
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            stack.push(c);
            if (stack.size() >= 3) {
                int len = stack.size();
                if (stack.get(len - 1) == 'c' && stack.get(len - 2) == 'b' && stack.get(len - 3) == 'a') {
                    stack.pop();
                    stack.pop();
                    stack.pop();
                }
            }
        }
        
        return stack.isEmpty();
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) — Each character is processed exactly once, and each stack operation (push and pop) is O(1).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) — In the worst case, the stack can contain all characters of `s` if no "abc" subsequence is present.
