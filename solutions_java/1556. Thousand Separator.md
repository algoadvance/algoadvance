[Leetcode 1556. Thousand Separator](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1556)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer `n`. You need to add a dot (".") as the thousands separator and return it in string format.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 987
Output: "987"
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 1234
Output: "1.234"
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the input number be negative?
   **A:** No, the input `n` is always a non-negative integer.

2. **Q:** Is there a maximum limit to the value of `n`?
   **A:** `n` is within the range `[0, 2^31 - 1]`.


### Strategy
1. Convert the integer to its string representation.
2. Initialize a result string and iterate backward from the end of the string.
3. Maintain a counter to keep track of every three characters.
4. Insert a dot every time you complete three characters.
5. Return the final formatted string.

### Code

```java
public class ThousandSeparator {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 1234567;
        System.out.println(thousandSeparator(n)); // Should return "1.234.567"
    }

    public static String thousandSeparator(int n) {
        // Convert number to string
        String numStr = Integer.toString(n);
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        
        // Counter to keep track of every three characters
        int count = 0;

        // Iterate from the end of the string towards the start
        for (int i = numStr.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            result.append(numStr.charAt(i));
            count++;
            // Add dot after every three characters
            if (count == 3 && i > 0) {
                result.append('.');
                count = 0;
            }
        }

        // Reverse the result to get the correct order
        return result.reverse().toString();
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of digits in the integer. We have to iterate through the string representation of the number once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), for the StringBuilder that stores the result.

This approach ensures that we correctly handle numbers of any length and format them with dots as the thousands separators.
