[Leetcode 2566. Maximum Difference by Remapping a Digit](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2566)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer `num` consisting of exactly four digits. You need to find and return the maximum possible difference you can achieve by remapping exactly one digit (0-9) to another digit (0-9). Remapping a digit means replacing all occurrences of it in the number with the new digit.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `num` be negative, or is it guaranteed to be a positive four-digit integer?**
   - It is guaranteed to be a positive four-digit integer.
   
2. **Can the remapped digit be the same as the original digit?**
   - While this is technically possible, it will not contribute to maximizing the difference. So, in practice, we would always choose a different digit for the remapping.

3. **Should we consider remapping leading zeros?**
   - No, remapping should keep the result as a four-digit number.

### Strategy
To solve the problem optimally:
1. **Identify Digits to Remap:** We iterate through each digit of the number and consider it as a candidate for remapping.
2. **Compute Results:** For each digit in the number, generate the new versions of the number by replacing it with digits 0-9, except for the digit itself.
3. **Calculate Difference:** Calculate the possible differences by remapping, and keep track of the maximum difference encountered.

### Code
Here is a simple and efficient approach implemented in Java:

```java
public class MaximumDifferenceByRemappingDigit {
    public static int minMaxDifference(int num) {
        String numStr = Integer.toString(num);
        int maxDifference = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        for (char c = '0'; c <= '9'; c++) {
            // Skip digit if it is not in the number
            if (numStr.indexOf(c) == -1) continue;
            
            // Perform remapping for max
            String maxStr = numStr.replace(c, '9');
            int maxVal = Integer.parseInt(maxStr);
            
            // Perform remapping for min
            String minStr = numStr.replace(c, '0');
            int minVal = Integer.parseInt(minStr);
            
            // Calculate difference
            int currentDifference = maxVal - minVal;

            // update maxDifference
            maxDifference = Math.max(maxDifference, currentDifference);
        }

        return maxDifference;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(minMaxDifference(1234)); // Example test case, should output the max difference
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O((D * N))`
  - Here, `D` is the number of digits (0-9) to potentially remap. Since it's always 10, it's a constant factor.
  - `N` is the number of digits in the number, which is 4 in this case.
  - Thus, the effective complexity is `O(4 * 10)`, which simplifies to `O(1)` as both factors are constants.
  
This approach efficiently finds the maximum possible difference by systematically remapping each digit and considering all valid new values.
