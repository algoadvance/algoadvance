[Leetcode 1001. Grid Illumination](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1001)
Sure, let's solve the LeetCode problem 1001: Grid Illumination using Java.

### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D grid of size `N x N`, and there are lamps in some cells. Each lamp illuminates every square on its row, column, and the two diagonals (45-degree angle). Given an array of lamp positions and an array of query positions, determine if each query position is illuminated or not, and then turn off any lamp that is in the cells adjacent to the query position (including the cell itself).

#### Input:
- `N`: size of the grid (N x N)
- `lamps`: a 2D array where each element is a pair `[x_i, y_i]` representing the position of a lamp
- `queries`: a 2D array where each element is a pair `[x_i, y_i]` representing a query position

#### Output:
- An array of integers where each integer is either 1 (illuminated) or 0 (not illuminated) for each query position.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the grid coordinates zero or one indexed?
    - Let's assume they are zero-indexed based on standard programming practice.
2. Can a lamp be placed more than once in the same cell?
    - Let's assume there are no duplicate lamps initially placed.
3. Are lamps turned off after processing each query even if they did not illuminate the queried cell?
    - Yes, we turn off the lamps adjacent to the query position including the queried cell itself.

### Strategy

1. Use mapping to keep track of the count of lights affecting each row, column, and the two diagonals.
2. Process each query to check if it is illuminated or not using the row, column, and diagonal mappings.
3. Turn off the lamp if found in the adjacent cells of the query.
4. Update the row, column, and diagonal mappings accordingly after turning off the lamps.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class GridIllumination {
    public int[] gridIllumination(int N, int[][] lamps, int[][] queries) {
        // Maps to count illuminated lines
        Map<Integer, Integer> rows = new HashMap<>();
        Map<Integer, Integer> cols = new HashMap<>();
        Map<Integer, Integer> diag1 = new HashMap<>();
        Map<Integer, Integer> diag2 = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Set for the active lamps
        Set<Long> lampsSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (int[] lamp : lamps) {
            int r = lamp[0], c = lamp[1];
            long hash = computeHash(r, c);
            if (lampsSet.add(hash)) {
                rows.put(r, rows.getOrDefault(r, 0) + 1);
                cols.put(c, cols.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
                diag1.put(r - c, diag1.getOrDefault(r - c, 0) + 1);
                diag2.put(r + c, diag2.getOrDefault(r + c, 0) + 1);
            }
        }
        
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int[][] directions = { {0, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}, {1, 0}, {1, 1}, {1, -1}, {-1, 0}, {-1, 1}, {-1, -1} };

        for (int[] query : queries) {
            int r = query[0], c = query[1];
            if (rows.getOrDefault(r, 0) > 0 ||
                cols.getOrDefault(c, 0) > 0 ||
                diag1.getOrDefault(r - c, 0) > 0 ||
                diag2.getOrDefault(r + c, 0) > 0) {
                result.add(1);
            } else {
                result.add(0);
            }
            
            //Turn off the lamp in the 9 adjacent cells including the cell itself
            for (int[] dir : directions) {
                int x = r + dir[0];
                int y = c + dir[1];
                long hash = computeHash(x, y);
                if (lampsSet.remove(hash)) {
                    rows.put(x, rows.getOrDefault(x, 0) - 1);
                    cols.put(y, cols.getOrDefault(y, 0) - 1);
                    diag1.put(x - y, diag1.getOrDefault(x - y, 0) - 1);
                    diag2.put(x + y, diag2.getOrDefault(x + y, 0) - 1);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result.stream().mapToInt(i -> i).toArray();
    }

    private long computeHash(int r, int c) {
        return ((long) r << 32) + c;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        GridIllumination sol = new GridIllumination();
        int[][] lamps = { {0, 0}, {4, 4} };
        int[][] queries = { {1, 1}, {1, 0} };
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(sol.gridIllumination(5, lamps, queries))); // Output: [1, 0]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Initial setup with all lamps: \( O(L) \), where \( L \) is the number of lamps.
- Each query processing including turning off lamps: \( O(1) \).
- Overall complexity for all queries: \( O(Q) \), where \( Q \) is the number of queries.
- This makes the final complexity \( O(L + Q) \).

This solution efficiently handles the grid illumination problem by leveraging hash maps to keep track of illuminated rows, columns, and diagonals efficiently.
