[Leetcode 1679. Max Number of K full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1679)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the maximum number of unique pairs `(a, b)` where `a` and `b` are elements of the array such that `a + b = k`. Also, each element in the array can only be used once.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What are the length bounds of the `nums` array?
    - What is the range of values for `nums[i]` and `k`?

    **Response:** 
    - The length of `nums` is between 1 and 10^5.
    - Each `nums[i]` is between -10^9 and 10^9, and `k` is also in the same range.

2. **Output Constraints:**
    - Should the pairs `(a, b)` be considered the same as `(b, a)`?
    
    **Response:**
    - Yes, the pairs `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` are considered identical.

3. **Expectations:**
    - Should the solution handle large arrays efficiently?
    - Should we take care of the uniqueness of the pairs ourselves?

    **Response:**
    - Yes, we should ensure the solution is optimized for large inputs.
    - Yes, each pair should be counted as unique even if they might seem reversed.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a HashMap to keep track of the elements and their frequencies. Hereâ€™s the plan:

1. **Initialize a HashMap**:
    - The key will be the element, and the value will be its frequency.
    
2. **Traverse the Input Array**:
    - For each element `num` in the array:
        - Compute the complement `complement = k - num`.
        - Check if the complement exists in the HashMap and if it has a non-zero count.
        - If it does, we have found a valid pair, increment the count of pairs, and decrement the counts of both `num` and `complement` in the HashMap.
        - If it doesn't, increment the frequency of `num` in the HashMap.

3. **Return the Count of Pairs**:
    - After processing all elements, return the total count of pairs found.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    public int maxOperations(int[] nums, int k) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();
        int pairsCount = 0;

        // Iterate through the array
        for (int num : nums) {
            int complement = k - num;
            if (frequencyMap.getOrDefault(complement, 0) > 0) {
                // If complement is found and count is positive, we found a pair
                pairsCount++;
                // Decrease the count of the complement
                frequencyMap.put(complement, frequencyMap.get(complement) - 1);
            } else {
                // Increment the count of the current number
                frequencyMap.put(num, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
            }
        }

        return pairsCount;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array `nums`. 
  - This is because each element is processed in constant time.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array `nums`.
  - In the worst case, all elements could be different and stored in the HashMap.

This solution is efficient and should work well within the input constraints.
