[Leetcode 3210. Find the Encrypted String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3210)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `S` of lowercase alphabet characters, convert it into its "encrypted" form by the following steps:
1. Find the middle character of `S`. If the length of `S` is odd, the middle character is the middle one. If the length is even, the middle character is the left one of the two "center" characters.
2. Append that character to the answer, then split the string into two halves (excluding the middle character) and repeat until no characters are left.

The final "encrypted" string is the concatenation of all middle characters found at each step.

### Clarifying Questions
- **Q:** What should be returned if the input string is empty?
  - **A:** An empty string should be returned.
- **Q:** How should we handle strings with an even number of characters?
  - **A:** For even-length strings, the middle character should be the one on the left side of the two middle characters.
- **Q:** Is the input always guaranteed to be a valid string of lowercase alphabet characters?
  - **A:** Yes, it's guaranteed.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach:
1. Define a helper function that takes a string and returns its "encrypted" form.
2. Find the middle character of the string and add it to the result.
3. Recursively process the left and right substrings (excluding the middle character) until the string is empty.
4. Concatenate and return the resulting middle characters.

### Code
```java
public class EncryptedString {
    public static String findEncryptedString(String S) {
        return encryptHelper(S);
    }

    private static String encryptHelper(String S) {
        if (S.isEmpty()) {
            return "";
        }
        int len = S.length();
        int midIndex = (len - 1) / 2; // Middle character index
        String middleChar = String.valueOf(S.charAt(midIndex));
        String leftPart = S.substring(0, midIndex);
        String rightPart = S.substring(midIndex + 1);

        // Recursively encrypt the left and right parts
        return middleChar + encryptHelper(leftPart) + encryptHelper(rightPart);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String S = "abc";
        System.out.println(findEncryptedString(S)); // Output: "bac"
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. The `findEncryptedString` method initiates the encryption by calling a helper method `encryptHelper`.
2. The `encryptHelper` method:
   - Base case: If the string is empty, return an empty string.
   - Calculate the middle character's index.
   - Extract the middle character.
   - Form the left and right substrings.
   - Concatenate the middle character with recursively computed encrypted versions of the left and right substrings.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n log n):
- At each recursive call, we split the string and perform operations that are linear in the length of the string. However, since the problem size reduces by half each time, this resembles the behavior of a merge sort algorithm.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n log n), where `n` is the length of the input string `S`.
