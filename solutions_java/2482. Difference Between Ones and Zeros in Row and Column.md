[Leetcode 2482. Difference Between Ones and Zeros in Row and Column](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2482)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D grid of size `m x n` consisting of only 1s and 0s. Your task is to calculate a new grid where each element in the new grid is computed as:

`diff[i][j] = (number of 1s in the ith row + number of 1s in the jth column) - (number of 0s in the ith row + number of 0s in the jth column)`

Return the new grid.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What are the constraints on the values of `m` and `n`?
   - Assume constraints are typical for such problems, e.g., \(1 \leq m, n \leq 1000\).

2. Can I modify the original grid, or should I create a new grid for the result?
   - We should create a new grid for the result.

3. Are there any edge cases to consider, such as grids with only 1s or 0s?
   - Yes, the solution should handle grids with only 1s or only 0s appropriately.

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Create two arrays, `rowOnes` and `colOnes`, of sizes `m` and `n`, respectively. These will store the number of 1s in each row and each column.

2. **Counting 1s**: Loop through the grid to populate `rowOnes` and `colOnes`.

3. **Calculating Diff Grid**:
   - Calculate the number of 0s in each row and column using the grid's dimensions (`number of 0s = total elements - number of 1s` for rows and columns).
   - Create an output grid `diff` where each element is calculated based on the formula provided in the problem statement.

4. **Returning the Result**: Return the `diff` grid.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int[][] onesMinusZeros(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        
        int[] rowOnes = new int[m];
        int[] colOnes = new int[n];
        
        // Count the number of 1s in each row and column
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                rowOnes[i] += grid[i][j];
                colOnes[j] += grid[i][j];
            }
        }
        
        int[][] diff = new int[m][n];
        
        // Compute the resulting grid using the formula
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                int rowCount = rowOnes[i];
                int colCount = colOnes[j];
                int rowZeroCount = n - rowCount;
                int colZeroCount = m - colCount;
                diff[i][j] = (rowCount + colCount) - (rowZeroCount + colZeroCount);
            }
        }
        
        return diff;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Counting 1s**: Takes \(O(m \times n)\) time since we need to iterate through the entire grid.
- **Calculating Diff Grid**: Also takes \(O(m \times n)\) time for the nested loops.
- Overall, the time complexity is \(O(m \times n)\).

This solution is efficient and should work well within the typical constraint limits.
