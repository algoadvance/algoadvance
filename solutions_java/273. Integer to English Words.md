[Leetcode 273. Integer to English Words](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l273)
## Problem Statement

Given a non-negative integer, convert the integer to its English words representation.

**Examples:**

- Input: `123`
- Output: `"One Hundred Twenty Three"`

- Input: `12345`
- Output: `"Twelve Thousand Three Hundred Forty Five"`

- Input: `1234567`
- Output: `"One Million Two Hundred Thirty Four Thousand Five Hundred Sixty Seven"`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**: Do we have a known range for the input integers?
   - **Answer**: The problem states non-negative integers, so the range is typically from `0` to `2^31 - 1` (i.e., 0 to 2147483647).

2. **Leading Zeros**: Are there any special rules for handling leading zeros?
   - **Answer**: Leading zeros in the input can be ignored since they do not affect the integer value.

3. **Output Format**: Is the output case-sensitive and should it deal with any punctuation?
   - **Answer**: The output should be in title case with words separated by a single space without any special punctuation.

## Strategy

1. **Divide and Conquer**: Break down the problem by segments: billions, millions, thousands, and then the remainder.
  
2. **Component Functions**: Write helper functions to convert numbers less than 1000, since larger segments like thousands, millions, and billions can be constructed using these smaller segments.

3. **Mapping Digits**: Use arrays or lists to store textual representations of digits, tens, and other special cases like teens.

4. **Edge Cases**: Handle special cases such as `0` directly since its output is a single word "Zero".

## Code

```java
public class IntegerToEnglishWords {
    
    private static final String[] BELOW_TWENTY = {"", "One", "Two", "Three", "Four", "Five", "Six", "Seven", "Eight", "Nine", "Ten", "Eleven", "Twelve", "Thirteen", "Fourteen", "Fifteen", "Sixteen", "Seventeen", "Eighteen", "Nineteen"};
    
    private static final String[] TENS = {"", "", "Twenty", "Thirty", "Forty", "Fifty", "Sixty", "Seventy", "Eighty", "Ninety"};
    
    private static final String[] THOUSANDS = {"", "Thousand", "Million", "Billion"};
    
    public String numberToWords(int num) {
        if (num == 0) return "Zero";
        
        String result = "";
        
        for (int i = 0; num > 0; i++) {
            if (num % 1000 != 0) {
                result = helper(num % 1000) + THOUSANDS[i] + " " + result;
            }
            num /= 1000;
        }
        
        return result.trim();
    }
    
    private String helper(int num) {
        if (num == 0) return "";
        else if (num < 20) return BELOW_TWENTY[num] + " ";
        else if (num < 100) return TENS[num / 10] + " " + helper(num % 10);
        else return BELOW_TWENTY[num / 100] + " Hundred " + helper(num % 100);
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        IntegerToEnglishWords converter = new IntegerToEnglishWords();
        // Test cases
        System.out.println(converter.numberToWords(123)); // "One Hundred Twenty Three"
        System.out.println(converter.numberToWords(12345)); // "Twelve Thousand Three Hundred Forty Five"
        System.out.println(converter.numberToWords(1234567)); // "One Million Two Hundred Thirty Four Thousand Five Hundred Sixty Seven"
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(1)`, as the function processes the number segment by segment, but there are a fixed number of segments (`billions`, `millions`, `thousands`, `units`). Each segment conversion is handled in constant time.

## Space Complexity

The space complexity is also `O(1)`, as we use a fixed amount of extra space for arrays and temporary variables.
