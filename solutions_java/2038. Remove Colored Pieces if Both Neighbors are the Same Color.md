[Leetcode 2038. Remove Colored Pieces if Both Neighbors are the Same Color](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2038)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `colors` consisting of colored pieces represented by 'A' and 'B'. The game involves removing a piece if it has the same color as both its neighbors. Alice can only remove 'A' pieces, and Bob can only remove 'B' pieces. Players alternate turns with Alice going first. Given the string `colors`, return `true` if Alice can win, and `false` if Bob can win, assuming both play optimally.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What does it mean for Alice or Bob to win?
   - Alice wins if she can make a move such that Bob cannot make a move afterward, and vice versa.
2. Can the string contain any characters other than 'A' and 'B'?
   - No, the string only contains 'A' and 'B'.

### Strategy
To determine the winner, we need to count potential moves for both Alice and Bob:
- Alice can make a move on 'A's only if there are three consecutive 'A's.
- Bob can make a move on 'B's only if there are three consecutive 'B's.

The solution involves:
1. Iterating over the string to count the number of valid moves for Alice and Bob.
2. Comparing the counts to decide the winner.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean winnerOfGame(String colors) {
        int aliceMoves = 0, bobMoves = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < colors.length() - 1; i++) {
            if (colors.charAt(i) == 'A' && colors.charAt(i - 1) == 'A' && colors.charAt(i + 1) == 'A') {
                aliceMoves++;
            } else if (colors.charAt(i) == 'B' && colors.charAt(i - 1) == 'B' && colors.charAt(i + 1) == 'B') {
                bobMoves++;
            }
        }
        // Alice goes first, so if she has more moves, she can always ensure Bob runs out of moves first.
        return aliceMoves > bobMoves;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string. We are iterating over the string once to count possible moves for both players.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using a fixed amount of extra space for variables `aliceMoves` and `bobMoves`.

This solution checks each triplet of characters exactly once and counts the potential moves for both Alice and Bob efficiently.
