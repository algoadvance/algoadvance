[Leetcode 374. Guess Number Higher or Lower](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l374)
### Problem Statement

You're playing a guessing game with your friend. The game is as follows:

- You need to guess a number between 1 and `n`.
- Your friend will tell you whether your guess is:
  - Lower than the target number (indicating you need to pick a higher number)
  - Higher than the target number (indicating you need to pick a lower number)
  - Correct (indicating you have found the number)

Your goal is to determine the target number with the fewest guesses.

You are given a function `int guess(int num)` that returns:
- `-1` if `num` is higher than the target number
- `1` if `num` is lower than the target number
- `0` if `num` is the target number

Your task is to implement the function `int guessNumber(int n)` that returns the target number.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range Clarity**: Can I assume `n` is always greater than or equal to 1?
2. **Input Validity**: Can `n` be a very large number, necessitating concerns about performance?
3. **Edge Cases**: Should I handle cases where `n` is minimal (e.g., 1)?

### Strategy

To efficiently determine the target number, we can use a binary search algorithm. By continually halving the search range based on feedback from the `guess()` function, we can pinpoint the target number in logarithmic time.

Steps:
1. Initialize two pointers, `low` and `high`, to 1 and `n` respectively.
2. While `low` is less than or equal to `high`:
   - Calculate the midpoint, `mid`.
   - Use the `guess(mid)` function to get feedback.
   - Adjust the search range based on the feedback.
3. When the `guess(mid)` function returns 0, we have found the target number and can return it.

### Code

```java
public class Solution extends GuessGame {
    public int guessNumber(int n) {
        int low = 1;
        int high = n;
        
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;  // Avoid potential overflow
            
            int result = guess(mid);
            
            if (result == 0) {
                return mid;
            } else if (result == -1) {
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        // If no number is found (though per problem statements, this point shouldn't be reached)
        return -1;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above solution is `O(log n)`, thanks to the binary search approach. Each iteration halves the search space, leading to a logarithmic number of iterations relative to the size of `n`.

### Summary

- **Problem**: Guess a target number between 1 and `n` using minimal comparisons.
- **Solution**: Implement binary search utilizing the `guess()` function for feedback.
- **Complexity**: The solution runs in `O(log n)` time, which is efficient for even large values of `n`.
