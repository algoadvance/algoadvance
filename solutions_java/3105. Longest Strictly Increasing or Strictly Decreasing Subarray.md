[Leetcode 3105. Longest Strictly Increasing or Strictly Decreasing Subarray](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3105)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `arr`. Write a function to find the length of the longest subarray which is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing. Subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^9 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`

The function signature in Java:
```java
public int longestAlternatingSubarray(int[] arr);
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What should be the output for an array with only one element?
   - **A:** The longest subarray in this case would be the array itself, so the length is 1.

2. **Q:** Should we consider both increasing and decreasing subarrays in one pass, or should we handle them separately?
   - **A:** Both strictly increasing and strictly decreasing subarrays should be considered in one pass for efficiency.

## Strategy

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Create variables to keep track of the maximal length subarray which can be incremented or decremented while traversing the array.
   - `maxLength`: To store the maximum length found for either increasing or decreasing subarrays.
   - `increasingLength` and `decreasingLength`: For keeping track of the lengths of currently considered strictly increasing and strictly decreasing subarrays.

2. **Traverse the Array:**
   - Iterate through the array from the second element to the end. For each element:
     - If the current element is greater than the previous element, increment `increasingLength` and reset `decreasingLength` to 1.
     - If the current element is less than the previous element, increment `decreasingLength` and reset `increasingLength` to 1.
     - If the current element is equal to the previous element, reset both `increasingLength` and `decreasingLength` to 1.
   - Update `maxLength` with the maximum value between `increasingLength`, `decreasingLength`, and the current `maxLength`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Single element array.
   - Array where all elements are the same.

## Code

Here is the Java implementation for the described strategy:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int longestAlternatingSubarray(int[] arr) {
        if (arr == null || arr.length == 0) return 0;
        if (arr.length == 1) return 1;

        int maxLength = 1;
        int increasingLength = 1;
        int decreasingLength = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > arr[i - 1]) {
                increasingLength++;
                decreasingLength = 1;  // reset decreasingLength
            } else if (arr[i] < arr[i - 1]) {
                decreasingLength++;
                increasingLength = 1;  // reset increasingLength
            } else {
                // Element equal to the previous one, so both are reset
                increasingLength = 1;
                decreasingLength = 1;
            }
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, Math.max(increasingLength, decreasingLength));
        }

        return maxLength;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        System.out.println(solution.longestAlternatingSubarray(arr));  // Output is 5 (strictly increasing)
        
        arr = new int[] {5, 4, 3, 2, 1};
        System.out.println(solution.longestAlternatingSubarray(arr));  // Output is 5 (strictly decreasing)
        
        arr = new int[] {1, 3, 5, 4, 2};
        System.out.println(solution.longestAlternatingSubarray(arr));  // Output is 3 (either 1, 3, 5 or 5, 4, 2)
        
        arr = new int[] {1, 2, 2, 1};
        System.out.println(solution.longestAlternatingSubarray(arr));  // Output is 2 (either 1, 2)
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input array `arr`. We only traverse the array once, making comparisons and updating variables in constant time.

The space complexity is **O(1)**, as we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
