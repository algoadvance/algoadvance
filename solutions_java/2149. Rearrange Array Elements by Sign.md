[Leetcode 2149. Rearrange Array Elements by Sign](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2149)
### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 2149: Rearrange Array Elements by Sign

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of **even** length consisting of an equal number of positive and negative integers.

You should **rearrange** the elements of `nums` such that the modified array follows the given conditions:

1. Every **consecutive** pair of integers have the opposite sign.
2. For all integers with the same sign, the order in which they were present in `nums` is preserved.
3. The rearranged array begins with a positive integer.

Return the modified array after rearranging the elements to satisfy the above conditions.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - The length of the array `nums` is even.
   - There are equal numbers of positive and negative integers in the array.

2. **Output Specifications**:
   - The returned array should start with a positive integer.
   - The order of appearance of positive and negative numbers should be preserved.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Are there any cases with `nums` containing zeros?
     - No, as every number is either positive or negative.

### Strategy

1. **Separate Positive and Negative Numbers**:
   - Iterate through the original array and separate the positive and negative numbers into two different lists.

2. **Reconstruct the Array**:
   - Use two pointers to alternately add elements from the positive and negative lists to form the resulting array.

### Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public int[] rearrangeArray(int[] nums) {
        List<Integer> positive = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Integer> negative = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Separate positive and negative numbers
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num > 0) {
                positive.add(num);
            } else {
                negative.add(num);
            }
        }
        
        int[] rearranged = new int[nums.length];
        int posIndex = 0, negIndex = 0;
        
        // Reconstruct the array
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                rearranged[i] = positive.get(posIndex++);
            } else {
                rearranged[i] = negative.get(negIndex++);
            }
        }
        
        return rearranged;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The solution has a linear time complexity, O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because:
  1. Separating positive and negative numbers requires a single pass through the array: O(n).
  2. Constructing the resulting array also requires a single pass to fill in the elements: O(n).

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) because:
  - We store the positive and negative numbers in separate lists, consuming additional linear space.
