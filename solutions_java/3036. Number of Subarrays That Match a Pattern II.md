[Leetcode 3036. Number of Subarrays That Match a Pattern II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3036)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and another array representing a pattern `pattern`, return the number of subarrays of `nums` that match the given `pattern`. The pattern matches a subarray if the relative ordering of the elements in the subarray is the same as in the pattern.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:** 
   - What are the constraints on the size of `nums` and `pattern`? 
   - Are there any constraints on the values within `nums` and `pattern`?

2. **Pattern Match:** 
   - Should the pattern match exactly in length with any subarray?
   
3. **Output Requirements:** 
   - Should the function return the count of such subarrays only, or do we also need to list them?

### Constraints and Assumptions
- Both `nums` and `pattern` will be arrays of integers.
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= pattern.length <= nums.length`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i], pattern[i] <= 10^9`

Let's assume that the pattern must match exactly in length with subarrays in `nums` and that the only requirement is the count of such subarrays.

## Strategy

The goal is to find how many subarrays of `nums` match the given `pattern` in terms of the relative ordering of elements. Hereâ€™s how we can break it down:

1. **Generate Pattern Indices:** Identify the relative order of elements in `pattern` (e.g., for `pattern = [4, 8, 6]`, the relative order is [0, 2, 1] because 4 < 6 < 8).
  
2. **Sliding Window:** Use a sliding window of the same length as `pattern` to check subarrays of `nums` for matching relative order.

3. **Comparison:** For each window in `nums`, check if the relative order of its elements matches the relative order of `pattern`.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class NumberOfSubarraysThatMatchPattern {
    
    public int numOfSubarraysMatchingPattern(int[] nums, int[] pattern) {
        int patternLen = pattern.length;
        int numsLen = nums.length;
        if (patternLen > numsLen) return 0;

        int[] patternOrder = getRelativeOrder(pattern);

        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i <= numsLen - patternLen; i++) {
            int[] currentWindow = Arrays.copyOfRange(nums, i, i + patternLen);
            int[] windowOrder = getRelativeOrder(currentWindow);
            if (Arrays.equals(patternOrder, windowOrder)) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }

    private int[] getRelativeOrder(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        Integer[] indices = new Integer[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) indices[i] = i;

        Arrays.sort(indices, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(arr[a], arr[b]));

        int[] order = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) order[indices[i]] = i;

        return order;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NumberOfSubarraysThatMatchPattern solution = new NumberOfSubarraysThatMatchPattern();
        int[] nums = {4, 6, 8, 6, 4, 8, 2, 6, 4};
        int[] pattern = {6, 4, 8};
        int result = solution.numOfSubarraysMatchingPattern(nums, pattern);
        System.out.println("Number of subarrays matching the pattern: " + result); // Output: expected number
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity Analysis

- **Sorting Relative Order:** For each `k`-length sliding window, generating the relative order involves sorting. This is O(k log k).
- **Total Sliding Windows:** There are `(n - k + 1)` windows of length `k` in `nums`.

Hence, the overall complexity is O((n - k + 1) * k log k), where `n` is the length of `nums` and `k` is the length of `pattern`. In the worst-case scenario where `k` is close to `n`, this becomes O(n * log n), but typically it would be sub-linear in terms of `n`.
