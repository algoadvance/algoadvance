[Leetcode 1870. Minimum Speed to Arrive on Time](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1870)
## Problem Statement

You are given a floating-point number `hour`, representing the amount of time you have to reach the office. To commute to the office, you must take `n` train rides in sequence. You are also given an integer array `dist` of length `n` where `dist[i]` describes the distance (in kilometers) of the `i-th` train ride.

Return the **minimum positive integer speed (in kilometers per hour)** that all the trains must travel at for you to reach the office on time, or `-1` if it is impossible to be on time.

**Note**: The trains can only travel at integer speeds and the total commuting time must be within `hour`. The total time taken to travel each distance `dist[i]` at a given speed `speed` is `ceil(dist[i] / speed)` for all except the last distance.

### Example
```
Input: dist = [1,3,2], hour = 6
Output: 1

Input: dist = [1,3,2], hour = 2.7
Output: 3

Input: dist = [1,3,2], hour = 1.9
Output: -1
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the permissible range for `dist` and `hour`?**
   - `1 <= dist.length <= 10^5`
   - `1 <= dist[i] <= 10^5`
   - `1 <= hour <= 10^7`

2. **Can `hour` be a fractional value?**
   - Yes, `hour` can be a floating-point number.

3. **What should be the return value if it's impossible to reach on time?**
   - Return `-1`.

## Strategy

The problem requires us to find the minimum speed such that the total travel time is within `hour`. Given the maximum constraints, a direct approach will be inefficient.

### Approach:
1. **Binary Search:** Given the large potential input size, a binary search provides an efficient way to find the minimum possible speed.
2. **Time Calculation:** For a given speed `s`, compute total time required:
   - Use ceiling for all but the last train distance.
   - Use exact division for the last train distance.

### Steps:
1. Set the binary search bounds:
   - `low = 1` (since the speed has to be a positive integer)
   - `high = 10^7` (initially setting a high upper bound since the maximum speed needs to be determined)
2. Use a while loop to perform binary search within the bounds.
3. In each iteration, calculate:
   - Middle point `mid` of current bounds.
   - Total travel time with speed `mid`.
4. Adjust bounds based on the total travel time calculation:
   - If the total time at `mid` speed is within `hour`, attempt lower speeds (`high = mid - 1`).
   - If not, attempt higher speeds (`low = mid + 1`).
5. Return the minimum feasible speed from the binary search.

## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int minSpeedOnTime(int[] dist, double hour) {
        int low = 1, high = 10000000; // Setting the initial bounds for speed
        int result = -1;
        
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (canReachOnTime(dist, hour, mid)) {
                result = mid; // valid speed found, but check for lower speed
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1; // need higher speed to meet the time constraint
            }
        }
        return result;
    }

    private boolean canReachOnTime(int[] dist, double hour, int speed) {
        double totalTime = 0.0;
        for (int i = 0; i < dist.length; i++) {
            if (i == dist.length - 1) {
                totalTime += (double) dist[i] / speed;
            } else {
                totalTime += Math.ceil((double) dist[i] / speed);
            }
        }
        return totalTime <= hour;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Binary Search:** O(log(max_speed)) = O(log(10^7)) = O(23)
- **Total Time Calculation per Speed Check:** O(n)
- **Overall Time Complexity:** O(n * log(10^7)). This is efficient given the constraints.

The binary search efficiently narrows down the minimum speed required by leveraging the `canReachOnTime` function within the permissible time limits.
