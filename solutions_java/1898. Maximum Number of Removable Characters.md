[Leetcode 1898. Maximum Number of Removable Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1898)
### Problem Statement
You are given two strings `s` and `p` where `p` is a subsequence of `s`. You are also given an integer array `removable` containing a list of indices of `s`. You want to make `p` not a subsequence of `s` by removing a certain number of characters from `s` using the indices in `removable`.

Return the maximum number of characters you can remove from `s` to make `p` not a subsequence of `s`.

### Example:
```
Input: s = "abcacb", p = "ab", removable = [3,1,0]
Output: 2
Explanation: The characters at indices 3 ("c") and 1 ("b") are removed, resulting in s = "aaccb". "ab" is no longer a subsequence of the modified s.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the indices array `removable` contain duplicate values?
    - No, each index in `removable` is unique.
2. Are the indices in `removable` guaranteed to be within the range of `s`?
    - Yes, indices in `removable` are valid indices of `s`.
3. What are the lengths of `s`, `p`, and `removable`?
    - We assume the length of `s` is `m`, length of `p` is `n`, and length of `removable` is `k`.

### Strategy

1. **Binary Search for Optimal Solution**: We'll use binary search to determine the maximum number of characters we can remove while making sure `p` is no longer a subsequence of `s`.
2. **Helper Function**: Create a helper function to remove characters from `s` based on the indices in `removable` and check if `p` is still a subsequence.
3. **Subsequence Check**: Use a two-pointer technique to check if `p` remains a subsequence of the modified `s`.

### Time Complexity
- **Binary Search Time Complexity**: `O(log k)`
- **Subsequence Check Time Complexity per Check**: `O(m + n)`
- The overall complexity would be `O((m + n) * log k)`.

### Code
```java
public class MaximumRemovableCharacters {
    public int maximumRemovals(String s, String p, int[] removable) {
        int low = 0, high = removable.length;
        
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = (low + high + 1) / 2;
            if (isSubsequence(s, p, removable, mid)) {
                low = mid;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return low;
    }
    
    private boolean isSubsequence(String s, String p, int[] removable, int k) {
        boolean[] removed = new boolean[s.length()];
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            removed[removable[i]] = true;
        }
        
        int j = 0; // Pointer for `p`
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length() && j < p.length(); i++) {
            if (!removed[i] && s.charAt(i) == p.charAt(j)) {
                j++;
            }
        }
        
        return j == p.length(); // p is a subsequence of modified s if we were able to iterate through `p`
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximumRemovableCharacters solver = new MaximumRemovableCharacters();
        String s = "abcacb";
        String p = "ab";
        int[] removable = {3, 1, 0};
        int result = solver.maximumRemovals(s, p, removable);
        System.out.println(result); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:
- Use binary search over the number of removable characters from `0` to `k`.
- The helper function `isSubsequence` determines if `p` is still a subsequence of `s` after removing `k` characters.
- Adjust the binary search bounds based on the result of `isSubsequence`.
- The final `low` will represent the maximum number of characters that can be removed to make `p` not a subsequence of `s`.
