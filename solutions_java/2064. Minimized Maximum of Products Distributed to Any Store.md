[Leetcode 2064. Minimized Maximum of Products Distributed to Any Store](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2064)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n` to represent the number of stores and an integer array `quantities` where `quantities[i]` represents the number of products of the `i-th` product type that need to be distributed to the stores. You want to distribute all the products to the stores such that the maximum number of products assigned to any store is minimized.

Return the minimized maximum number of products that can be assigned to any store.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: n = 6, quantities = [11, 6]
Output: 3
Explanation: One optimal way is:
- 3 stores get 3 products each (3*3 = 9). THE 4th store gets 2 products.
- 2 stores get 3 products each.
The maximum number of products in any store is 3.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can `n` be smaller than the length of `quantities`?
   - No, `n` will be greater than or equal to the total number of product types.
2. Can the `quantities` array contain zero?
   - No, `quantities` will contain positive integers.
3. What should be returned if the distribution is not possible?
   - By problem constraints, there will always be a distribution possible.

### Strategy

1. **Binary Search Approach:** The goal is to minimize the maximum number of products assigned to any store.
2. Define search bounds:
   - The lower bound (`low`) is 1 (minimum possible products per store).
   - The upper bound (`high`) is the maximum value in `quantities` (worst case, one store gets all products of a particular type).
3. Use binary search to minimize the maximum number of products per store.
4. For each mid value, use a helper function to check if it's possible to distribute products such that no store gets more than `mid` products.

### Helper Function
- Define a function `isPossible(quantities, n, maxProductsPerStore)` that returns `True` if itâ€™s possible to distribute the products such that no store gets more than `maxProductsPerStore` products. This checks if the required number of stores does not exceed `n`.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minimizedMaximum(int n, int[] quantities) {
        int low = 1;
        int high = 0;

        // Finding the highest value in quantities array
        for (int quantity : quantities) {
            high = Math.max(high, quantity);
        }

        // Binary search to find the minimized maximum products per store
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            if (isPossible(quantities, n, mid)) {
                high = mid;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return low;
    }

    // Helper function to check if we can distribute within maxProductsPerStore limit
    private boolean isPossible(int[] quantities, int n, int maxProductsPerStore) {
        int storeCount = 0;

        // Count number of stores needed
        for (int quantity : quantities) {
            storeCount += (quantity + maxProductsPerStore - 1) / maxProductsPerStore;
        }
        return storeCount <= n;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int n = 6;
        int[] quantities = {11, 6};
        System.out.println(solution.minimizedMaximum(n, quantities)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Binary search complexity:** O(log(max(quantities))).
- **Checking feasibility for each mid:** O(m), where `m` is the length of `quantities`.

Overall time complexity is **O(m * log(max(quantities)))**.

This solution efficiently determines the minimized maximum number of products any store gets using binary search combined with a feasibility check.
