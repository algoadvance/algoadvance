[Leetcode 1574. Shortest Subarray to be Removed to Make Array Sorted](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1574)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `arr`, you're asked to remove a subarray of length `k` such that the resulting array is sorted in non-decreasing order. Return the length `k` of the shortest subarray that you can remove.

### Example
1. Input: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 10, 4, 2, 3, 5]`
   - Output: `3`
2. Input: `arr = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
   - Output: `4`
3. Input: `arr = [1, 2, 3]`
   - Output: `0`

### Clarifying Questions
1. Does the array contain only integers?
    - Yes.
2. Could the array contain negative integers?
    - Yes.
3. Is the array always non-empty?
    - Yes, you can assume the array has at least one element.

### Strategy
1. **Identify Non-Decreasing Prefix and Suffix**:
   - Find the longest prefix from the start that is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - Find the longest suffix from the end that is sorted in non-decreasing order.
   
2. **Combine Prefix and Suffix**:
   - The array can be made non-decreasing if we combine the non-decreasing prefix and suffix such that elements in the suffix are greater than or equal to the last element of the prefix.
   - Iterate through all possible combinations of prefix and suffix lengths to find the minimum length of the subarray to remove.
   
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array is already non-decreasing, return 0.
   - If the array is sorted in strictly decreasing order, return `n - 1` where `n` is the length of the array.

### Code Implementation

```java
public class ShortestSubarrayRemoval {
    public int findLengthOfShortestSubarray(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int left = 0;
        
        // Find the longest non-decreasing prefix
        while (left < n - 1 && arr[left] <= arr[left + 1]) {
            left++;
        }
        
        // If the whole array is non-decreasing return 0
        if (left == n - 1) {
            return 0;
        }

        int right = n - 1;
        
        // Find the longest non-decreasing suffix
        while (right > 0 && arr[right] >= arr[right - 1]) {
            right--;
        }
        
        // Try to combine prefix and suffix
        int toRemove = Math.min(n - left - 1, right); // if we remove whole prefix or suffix
        
        // Merge prefix [0...left] with suffix [right...n-1]
        int i = 0, j = right;
        while (i <= left && j < n) {
            if (arr[i] <= arr[j]) {
                toRemove = Math.min(toRemove, j - i - 1);
                i++;
            } else {
                j++;
            }
        }

        return toRemove;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ShortestSubarrayRemoval solution = new ShortestSubarrayRemoval();
        System.out.println(solution.findLengthOfShortestSubarray(new int[]{1, 2, 3, 10, 4, 2, 3, 5})); // Output: 3
        System.out.println(solution.findLengthOfShortestSubarray(new int[]{5, 4, 3, 2, 1})); // Output: 4
        System.out.println(solution.findLengthOfShortestSubarray(new int[]{1, 2, 3})); // Output: 0
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input array. This is because the algorithm involves a few linear passes over the array to find the longest non-decreasing prefix and suffix and a final linear pass to find the minimum subarray removal required.
