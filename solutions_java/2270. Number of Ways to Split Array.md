[Leetcode 2270. Number of Ways to Split Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2270)
### Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n`.

 `nums` contains a positive integer only.

You need to split the array into exactly two non-empty parts such that the first part has a sum greater than or equal to the sum of the second part. 

More formally, if you split the array `nums` into `nums1` and `nums2`, then you need to satisfy the condition:
 
 `sum(nums1) >= sum(nums2)` and `nums1` and `nums2` are non-empty.
 
Return the number of ways to split the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the range of values for `n` (the length of the array)?
   - Assume `1 <= n <= 10^5`.
   
2. **Element Values**: Are there any constraints on the individual elements in `nums`?
   - Assume `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`.

3. **Edge Cases**: Do we need to consider very small arrays, such as those of length 1 or 2?
   - Since the array must be split into two non-empty parts, the minimum valid array length should be 2.

### Code

```java
public class NumberOfWaysToSplitArray {

    public int waysToSplitArray(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;

        long totalSum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            totalSum += num;
        }

        long leftSum = 0;
        int ways = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
            leftSum += nums[i];
            long rightSum = totalSum - leftSum;
            if (leftSum >= rightSum) {
                ways++;
            }
        }

        return ways;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NumberOfWaysToSplitArray solution = new NumberOfWaysToSplitArray();
        int[] nums = {10, 4, -8, 7};
        System.out.println(solution.waysToSplitArray(nums)); // Expected output: 2
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Total Sum Calculation**: First, compute the total sum of the array. This will allow us to get the sum of the right part efficiently.
   
2. **Iterative Splitting**: Iterate through the array, updating the left sum as you go. For each index, compute the right sum by subtracting the left sum from the total sum. Check if the condition `leftSum >= rightSum` holds and count such instances.

3. **Edge Handling**: Ensure to stop one index before the end during iteration as the last index cannot form a valid second part.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. This is because we perform a single pass to compute the total sum and another pass to check the split condition for each prefix of the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we use only a fixed amount of additional space for variables to store sums and the counter.
