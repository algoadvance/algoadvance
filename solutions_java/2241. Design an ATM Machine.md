[Leetcode 2241. Design an ATM Machine](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2241)
## Problem Statement

You have to design an ATM machine that supports operations for depositing and withdrawing money efficiently. The ATM machine has an unlimited storage capacity for money of the following denominations: $20, $50, $100, $200, and $500. The operation methods required are:

1. `void deposit(int[]):` Takes an array of 5 integers representing the number of banknotes of each denomination to deposit.
2. `int[] withdraw(int amount):` Takes a single integer `amount` representing the amount of money to withdraw. The method should return an array of 5 integers representing the number of banknotes of each denomination used to fulfill the withdrawal. If it is not possible to withdraw the given amount, it should return `[-1]`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What should be the order of the denominations in the arrays used in methods `deposit` and `withdraw`?
   - The denominations are in the order [20, 50, 100, 200, 500].

2. What should be the initial state of the ATM machine?
   - It starts empty, i.e., with zero notes of each denomination.

3. Should the `withdraw` method prioritize higher denominations?
   - Yes, using higher denominations first generally minimizes the number of notes dispensed and leaves more flexibility for future withdrawals.

## Strategy

1. Use an array, `banknotes`, to keep track of the count of each denomination in the ATM:
   - `banknotes[0]` represents the number of $20 notes.
   - `banknotes[1]` represents the number of $50 notes.
   - `banknotes[2]` represents the number of $100 notes.
   - `banknotes[3]` represents the number of $200 notes.
   - `banknotes[4]` represents the number of $500 notes.

2. For the `deposit` method:
   - Iterate through the input array and increment the corresponding values in the `banknotes` array.

3. For the `withdraw` method:
   - Iterate through the denominations array starting from the highest denomination.
   - Greedily withdraw as many notes as possible of the current denomination without exceeding the available count or the remaining amount to be dispensed.
   - If the withdrawal cannot be completed with the available notes, return `[-1]`.
   - Otherwise, update the `banknotes` array to reflect the withdrawn notes and return the result.

## Code

```java
public class ATM {
    private long[] banknotes;
    private int[] denominations = {20, 50, 100, 200, 500};

    public ATM() {
        this.banknotes = new long[5]; // Initialize storage for 5 denominations
    }

    public void deposit(int[] banknotes) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            this.banknotes[i] += banknotes[i];
        }
    }

    public int[] withdraw(int amount) {
        int[] result = new int[5];
        long[] copyOfBanknotes = banknotes.clone();

        for (int i = 4; i >= 0; i--) {
            int noteValue = denominations[i];
            long maxNotesToUse = Math.min(copyOfBanknotes[i], amount / noteValue);
            result[i] = (int) maxNotesToUse;
            amount -= maxNotesToUse * noteValue;
        }

        if (amount > 0) {
            return new int[]{-1}; // Withdrawal not possible with available banknotes
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
            banknotes[i] -= result[i];
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The `deposit` method operates in \(O(1)\) time, as it iterates over a fixed array of 5 elements.
- The `withdraw` method operates in \(O(1)\) time as well, as it also iterates over a fixed array of 5 elements.

Both methods are constant time operations, making the implementation very efficient in terms of time complexity.
