[Leetcode 2916. Subarrays Distinct Element Sum of Squares II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2916)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` of positive integers. Your task is to find the sum of the squares of distinct elements for every subarray within `nums`, and then return the sum of these values.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the elements in the array always positive integers?**
   - Yes, the problem statement mentions that the array contains positive integers.

2. **What is the range of the array length `n`?**
   - This is not specified, but it's safe to assume we need to handle reasonably large arrays efficiently.

3. **Do empty subarrays count as valid subarrays?**
   - No, we consider non-empty subarrays only.

4. **If a subarray has repeated elements, do we count each element only once for the sum of squares calculation?**
   - Yes, we consider only unique elements within a subarray to calculate the sum of their squares.

### Strategy

The brute force approach would involve generating all possible subarrays, finding distinct elements within each subarray, computing the sum of their squares, and then summing these values across all subarrays. However, this approach would be inefficient given the time complexity:

1. Generate all possible subarrays: \(O(n^2)\)
2. For each subarray, compute distinct elements and sum of squares: Another \(O(n)\)

This results in an overall time complexity of \(O(n^3)\), which is not feasible for large arrays.

Instead, we can use a sliding window and a hashmap to keep track of the frequency of elements in the current window. This should help in efficiently managing distinct elements and their squares.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public long sumOfSquaresOfDistinctElements(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        long totalSum = 0;

        // Use a hashmap to store the frequency of elements in the current window
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> freqMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int start = 0; start < n; start++) { // start of the subarray
            freqMap.clear();
            long subarraySum = 0;
            for (int end = start; end < n; end++) { // end of the subarray
                int num = nums[end];
                if (freqMap.containsKey(num) && freqMap.get(num) > 0) {
                    // If already present in window, we don't add its square again
                    freqMap.put(num, freqMap.get(num) + 1);
                } else {
                    // Else, we add its square to the subarray sum
                    freqMap.put(num, 1);
                    subarraySum += (long) num * num;
                }
                // Add the sum of squares for the current subarray
                totalSum += subarraySum;
            }
        }

        return totalSum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {1,2,3};
        System.out.println(solution.sumOfSquaresOfDistinctElements(nums)); // Expected output depends on specific array values
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Outer Loop (start):** \(O(n)\) - Iterates over each possible start of the subarray.
- **Inner Loop (end):** \(O(n)\) - For each start, iterates over each possible end of the subarray.
- **Operations within the inner loop (adding to hashmap, computing the square):** \(O(1)\)

Since we clear the frequency map in each iteration of the outer loop, the combined time complexity of generating subarrays and processing them is \(O(n^2)\), which is a significant improvement over the \(O(n^3)\) brute-force approach.
