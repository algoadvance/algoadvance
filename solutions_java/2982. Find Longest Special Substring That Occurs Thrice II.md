[Leetcode 2982. Find Longest Special Substring That Occurs Thrice II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2982)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, you are required to find the longest special substring that occurs at least three times in `s`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the minimum length of the string `s`?**
   - The minimum length of the string `s` is `1`.
2. **Can the input string contain special characters and spaces?**
   - Yes, the string can contain any valid ASCII characters including spaces and special characters.
3. **If there is no substring that occurs at least three times, what should be the output?**
   - If no such substring exists, the output should be an empty string `""`.
4. **Are there any constraints regarding the length of the substring we are looking for?**
   - There are no explicit constraints except that the substring should occur at least three times.

### Strategy

1. **Start with the Longest Possible Substring:**
   - Use a binary search approach to find the length of the longest substring that appears at least three times.

2. **Binary Search on Length:**
   - Define the binary search range between 1 and the length of the string.
   - For each middle length, use a sliding window strategy along with a hash set to check if any substring of the current length appears at least three times.

3. **Sliding Window and Hashing:**
   - Use a hash map to count the frequency of all substrings of a given length.
   - If any substring appears at least three times, adjust the binary search accordingly to look for longer substrings.

4. **Return the Longest Substring:**
   - Keep track of and return the longest substring that meets the condition.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class LongestSpecialSubstring {

    public static String longestSpecialSubstring(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int low = 1, high = n;
        String result = "";

        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            String candidate = findSubstringWithLength(s, mid);

            if (candidate != null) {
                result = candidate;
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }

    private static String findSubstringWithLength(String s, int length) {
        Map<String, Integer> substringCount = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i <= s.length() - length; i++) {
            String substring = s.substring(i, i + length);
            substringCount.put(substring, substringCount.getOrDefault(substring, 0) + 1);

            if (substringCount.get(substring) >= 3) {
                return substring;
            }
        }
        return null;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(longestSpecialSubstring("abababab")); // Example
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Binary Search:** 
   - The binary search runs in O(log N) iterations, where N is the length of the string.

2. **Counting Substrings:**
   - For each length `L` being tested, creating hash map entries for substrings of length `L` takes O(N).
   - In the worst case, this would involve O(N) operations for length 1 to N/2.

**Overall Time Complexity:** The complexity can be approximated as O(N log N), which is efficient for moderately long strings.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest substring that appears at least three times in the given string.
