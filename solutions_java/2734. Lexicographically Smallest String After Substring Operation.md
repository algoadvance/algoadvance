[Leetcode 2734. Lexicographically Smallest String After Substring Operation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2734)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, you can perform the following operation any number of times:

1. Choose any substring of `s` and sort it in non-decreasing order.

Return the lexicographically smallest string you can achieve after applying the above operation any number of times.

### Example:

    Input: s = "dcab"
    Output: "abcd"

    Explanation:
    Perform the following operations:
    - Choose substring "d" and sort it => "dcab"
    - Choose substring "dc" and sort it => "cdab"
    - Choose substring "cdab" and sort it => "abcd"

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the string contain uppercase letters?
   **A:** The problem does not specifically mention this, so I will assume it contains only lowercase letters.

2. **Q:** Can we choose the same substring multiple times?
   **A:** Yes, you can choose any substring any number of times.

3. **Q:** Is the return type always a string?
   **A:** Yes, the output should always be the lexicographically smallest string.

## Strategy

The problem can be directly solved by sorting the entire string. Since sorting is a fundamental operation in achieving a lexicographically smallest string and since we can perform the sorting operation on any substring any number of times, we can always consider sorting the whole string directly.

### Steps:

1. Convert the input string into a character array.
2. Sort the character array.
3. Convert the sorted character array back to a string.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of sorting a string of length `n` is `O(n log n)`, which is efficient for this problem.

## Code

```java
public class LexicographicallySmallestString {
    public static String makeSmallestString(String s) {
        char[] charArray = s.toCharArray();
        Arrays.sort(charArray);
        return new String(charArray);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "dcab";
        System.out.println(makeSmallestString(s));  // Output: "abcd"
    }
}
```

In this solution:
- We first convert the string `s` to a character array.
- We use `Arrays.sort` to sort the characters in non-decreasing order.
- We then convert the sorted character array back to a string and return it.

This approach ensures the smallest lexicographical order for the given string.
