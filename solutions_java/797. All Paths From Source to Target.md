[Leetcode 797. All Paths From Source to Target](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l797)
### Problem Statement
Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) of `N` nodes labeled from `0` to `N-1`, find all possible paths from node `0` to node `N-1`, and return them in any order.

The graph is given as a list of lists, where `graph[i]` is a list of all nodes `j` for which the edge `(i, j)` exists.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can there be multiple paths from the source to the target?
   - **A:** Yes, and we need to find all such paths.

2. **Q:** What should be the format of the output?
   - **A:** The output should be a list of lists, where each list represents a path from node `0` to node `N-1`.

3. **Q:** Will the graph have cycles?
   - **A:** No, since the graph is a directed acyclic graph (DAG).

4. **Q:** What is the maximum size of the graph?
   - **A:** The graph can be of size up to `15` nodes (0 to 14).

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore all paths from the source node (`0`) to the target node (`N-1`). Since the graph is a DAG, there will be no cycles, making DFS an appropriate choice.

1. **Initialization**:
   - Define a method to perform the DFS traversal.
   - Use a list to keep track of the current path and a list of lists to store all the valid paths.

2. **DFS Execution**:
   - Start the DFS traversal from node `0`.
   - For each node, recursively explore all its neighbors.
   - If node `N-1` is reached, add the current path to the list of valid paths.
   - Backtrack to explore other possible paths.

3. **Return the Results**:
   - After the DFS traversal completes, return the list containing all valid paths.

### Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> allPathsSourceTarget(int[][] graph) {
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Integer> path = new ArrayList<>();
        dfs(graph, 0, path, result);
        return result;
    }
    
    private void dfs(int[][] graph, int node, List<Integer> path, List<List<Integer>> result) {
        path.add(node);
        // If the current node is the target, add the path to the result
        if (node == graph.length - 1) {
            result.add(new ArrayList<>(path));
        } else {
            // Explore all the neighbors of the current node
            for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
                dfs(graph, neighbor, path, result);
            }
        }
        // Backtrack to explore other paths
        path.remove(path.size() - 1);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[][] graph = { {1, 2}, {3}, {3}, {} };
        List<List<Integer>> paths = sol.allPathsSourceTarget(graph);
        System.out.println(paths);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is \(O(2^N \cdot N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the graph. This complexity arises because:
- In the worst case, each node can have up to \(N-1\) outgoing edges, leading to an exponential number of paths to explore (up to \(2^N\)).
- Constructing each path and copying it to the result list takes \(O(N)\) time.

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**:
   - The `allPathsSourceTarget` method initializes the `result` list to store all paths and the `path` list to store the current path during the DFS traversal.

2. **DFS Execution**:
   - The `dfs` method is a recursive helper function that explores all paths starting from the given `node`.

3. **Path Recording**:
   - When the target node (`N-1`) is reached, the current path is added to the `result`.

4. **Backtracking**:
   - After exploring all neighbors, the current node is removed from the `path` to allow exploration of other paths.

By utilizing DFS and backtracking, the solution efficiently finds all paths from the source to the target in the given DAG.
