[Leetcode 1473. Paint House III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1473)
### Problem Statement
You are given a row of `m` houses, numbered from 0 to m - 1, that need to be painted. Each house can be painted with one of `n` colors (labeled from 1 to n), and some houses may already be painted (represented by houses array). 

- `houses[i]` is the color of the house `i`, and 0 if the house is not painted yet.
- You will have to paint all the houses `houses` in such a way that exactly `target` neighborhoods are formed. 
- A neighborhood is defined as a maximal group of continuous houses that are painted with the same color.

You are also given an integer matrix `cost` where `cost[i][j]` is the cost of painting house `i` with color `j + 1`. 

Return the minimum cost of painting all the remaining houses such that there are exactly `target` neighborhoods. If it is not possible, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can multiple houses be painted in one operation or is it one house at a time?
   - Each house has its own cost in the `cost` matrix and each needs to be considered individually.
2. Are the provided costs always positive?
   - Yes, the costs in the `cost` matrix are positive integers.
3. If a house is already painted, is the cost to paint it considered zero?
   - Correct, if a house is already painted, the painting cost won't be taken into account for that house.
4. What will be the maximum values for m, n, and target?
   - Typically, these constraints ensure feasible computation within the scope of dynamic programming.

### Strategy
We can use a dynamic programming (DP) approach to solve this problem. We'll use a 3D DP table where `dp[i][j][k]` represents the minimum cost to paint the first `i` houses with exactly `k` neighborhoods and the `i`-th house painted with color `j`.

#### Steps:
1. **Initialization**: Initialize a large value for impossible states.
2. **DP Table Update**:
   - Iterate over each house.
   - For each color, update the cost considering if current house is contributing to a new neighborhood or extending a previous neighborhood.
3. **Final Calculation**: Retrieve the minimum cost from the DP table that matches the target neighborhoods.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int minCost(int[] houses, int[][] cost, int m, int n, int target) {
        final int INF = Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2;
        int[][][] dp = new int[m][n + 1][target + 1];

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
                Arrays.fill(dp[i][j], INF);
            }
        }

        if (houses[0] != 0) {
            dp[0][houses[0]][1] = 0;
        } else {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                dp[0][j][1] = cost[0][j - 1];
            }
        }

        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                if (houses[i] != 0 && houses[i] != j) continue;
                int currentCost = (houses[i] == 0) ? cost[i][j - 1] : 0;

                for (int prevColor = 1; prevColor <= n; prevColor++) {
                    for (int k = 1; k <= target; k++) {
                        if (j == prevColor) {
                            dp[i][j][k] = Math.min(dp[i][j][k], dp[i - 1][prevColor][k] + currentCost);
                        } else {
                            if (k > 1) {
                                dp[i][j][k] = Math.min(dp[i][j][k], dp[i - 1][prevColor][k - 1] + currentCost);
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        int result = INF;
        for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            result = Math.min(result, dp[m - 1][j][target]);
        }

        return result == INF ? -1 : result;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(m \times n^2 \times \text{target})\) because:
- We iterate over each house `i` (m houses).
- For each house, we iterate over each color `j` (n colors).
- Within each color, we check each previous color and manipulate the target neighborhoods (n colors for each of `target` neighborhoods).

The space complexity is also \(O(m \times n \times \text{target})\) because of the 3D DP array we maintain.

This ensures an efficient solution given typical constraints in competitive programming and interview contexts.
