[Leetcode 1816. Truncate Sentence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1816)
## Problem Statement
You are given a sentence `s` and an integer `k`. You need to return a string containing the first `k` words from the given sentence.

### Example
- Input: `s = "Hello how are you Contestant"`, `k = 4`
- Output: `"Hello how are you"`

### Constraints
- The sentence `s` consists of words separated by spaces.
- Each word consists of only lowercase and uppercase English letters.
- The number of words in `s` is at most `500`.
- `k` is in the range of `[1, the number of words in s]`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What separators are used in the sentences?**  
   The sentence uses spaces to separate words.

2. **Can the input string be empty or contain any special characters?**  
   No, the input string will not be empty and will only contain words with English letters separated by spaces.

3. **Is leading or trailing whitespace a concern to handle?**  
   No, the problem guarantees that the input sentence does not have leading or trailing whitespace.

## Strategy
1. **Split the Sentence**: Use the `split(" ")` method to break the sentence into an array of words.
2. **Select the First `k` Words**: Use array slicing or a similar method to take the first `k` elements from the array.
3. **Join the Words**: Use `String.join(" ", parts)` to join the selected first `k` words back into a single string.

## Time Complexity
1. **Splitting the Sentence**: The split operation is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the sentence string.
2. **Slicing the Array**: This operation is `O(k)`.
3. **Joining the Words**: This operation is `O(k)`.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n + k)`.

## Code
Here is the Java code implementing the above logic:

```java
public class TruncateSentence {
    public String truncateSentence(String s, int k) {
        // Split the sentence into an array of words
        String[] words = s.split(" ");
        
        // Use StringBuilder to efficiently build the output string
        StringBuilder truncated = new StringBuilder();
        
        // Append the first k words to the string builder
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            truncated.append(words[i]);
            // Add a space after each word except the last word
            if (i < k - 1) {
                truncated.append(" ");
            }
        }
        
        // Convert StringBuilder to String and return
        return truncated.toString();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TruncateSentence ts = new TruncateSentence();
        System.out.println(ts.truncateSentence("Hello how are you Contestant", 4)); // "Hello how are you"
    }
}
```

This solution efficiently handles the truncation of the sentence and ensures that the first `k` words are returned as expected.
