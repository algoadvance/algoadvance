[Leetcode 1694. Reformat Phone Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1694)
### Problem Statement
You are given a phone number in the form of a string `number`. `number` consists of digits, spaces `' '`, and/or dashes `'-'`. You want to reformat the phone number in a certain manner. Firstly, remove all spaces and dashes. Then, group the digits from left to right into blocks of length 3 until only 4 or fewer digits are left. After that, the reformatting is done as follows:

- If there are 4 digits left, they should be split into two blocks of length 2.
- The blocks should be separated by dashes.

Return the phone number after reformatting.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the maximum length of the phone number string?**
   - The problem does not specify, but we can assume it to be reasonably large to fit within typical phone number scenarios.

2. **Are there any other characters we need to consider apart from spaces and dashes?**
   - No, only digits, spaces, and dashes are considered.

3. **Should we handle invalid inputs or assume that input is always valid as per the problem description?**
   - We can assume the input is always formatted as described in the problem.

### Strategy
1. **Remove non-digit characters:** We will first remove all spaces `' '` and dashes `'-'` from the string.
2. **Reformat the digits into groups:**
   - If the number of remaining digits is more than 4, group them into chunks of 3.
   - If we have exactly 4 digits remaining, split them into two groups of 2.
3. **Join the groups with dashes** and return the result.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public String reformatNumber(String number) {
        // Step 1: Remove spaces and dashes
        StringBuilder digits = new StringBuilder();
        for (char ch : number.toCharArray()) {
            if (Character.isDigit(ch)) {
                digits.append(ch);
            }
        }
        
        // Step 2: Reformat digits into blocks of length 3 or 2
        int length = digits.length();
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        int i = 0;
        
        // Process chunks of 3 until the remaining characters are handled
        while (length - i > 4) {
            result.append(digits.substring(i, i + 3));
            result.append("-");
            i += 3;
        }
        
        // Handle the last 4 or fewer characters
        if (length - i == 4) {
            result.append(digits.substring(i, i + 2));
            result.append("-");
            result.append(digits.substring(i + 2));
        } else {
            result.append(digits.substring(i));
        }
        
        return result.toString();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.reformatNumber("1-23-45 6"));       // Output: "123-456"
        System.out.println(sol.reformatNumber("123 4-567"));       // Output: "123-45-67"
        System.out.println(sol.reformatNumber("123 4-5678"));      // Output: "123-456-78"
        System.out.println(sol.reformatNumber("12"));              // Output: "12"
        System.out.println(sol.reformatNumber("--17-5 229 35-39475 ")); // Output: "175-229-353-94-75"
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the input string `number`. This is because:
- Removing non-digit characters takes **O(n)** time.
- The reformatting takes **O(n)** time as we process each digit at most once.

This approach is efficient and runs in linear time with respect to the length of the input.
