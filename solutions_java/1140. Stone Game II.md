[Leetcode 1140. Stone Game II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1140)
### Problem Statement

You are playing a game with several piles of stones, where each pile contains a positive integer number of stones `[p1, p2, ..., pn]`. The objective is to maximize the number of stones you can get against an opponent playing optimally. 

The game starts with Alice picking stones. She can pick at most `2 * M` piles of stones, where `M` starts at 1. After Alice's turn, `M` is updated to the maximum between `M` and the number of piles Alice just picked up. The objective is to determine the maximum number of stones Alice can collect if both players play optimally.

### Example:
```
Input: [2, 7, 9, 4, 4]
Output: 10
```

Alice can first pick 2 piles and then maximize her score considering the opponent's optimal choices.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Is the sum of the stones in each pile always positive and non-zero?**
   - Yes.
2. **Can both players see the entire array and make decisions with full knowledge of the array?**
   - Yes, both players play optimally with full knowledge of the stones in each pile.
3. **What's the range of the number of piles `n`?**
   - This problem typically can handle up to around 100 stones.

### Strategy

1. **Recursive Definition**: We can define a function `dfs(piles, index, M)` that returns the maximum number of stones a player can collect starting from the `index`-th pile with the given value of `M`.

2. **Memoization**: Use a memoization table to store and reuse the results of subproblems to avoid recomputation.

3. **Suffix Sums**: Precompute the suffix sums to get the total stones from any index to the end more efficiently.

### Solution Code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class StoneGameII {
    public int stoneGameII(int[] piles) {
        int n = piles.length;
        int[][] memo = new int[n][n];
        for (int[] row : memo) Arrays.fill(row, -1);
        
        int[] suffixSums = new int[n];
        suffixSums[n - 1] = piles[n - 1];
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            suffixSums[i] = suffixSums[i + 1] + piles[i];
        }

        return dfs(piles, 0, 1, suffixSums, memo);
    }

    private int dfs(int[] piles, int i, int M, int[] suffixSums, int[][] memo) {
        if (i == piles.length) return 0;
        if (2 * M >= piles.length - i) return suffixSums[i];
        if (memo[i][M] != -1) return memo[i][M];

        int maxStones = 0;
        for (int x = 1; x <= 2 * M; x++) {
            int opponent = dfs(piles, i + x, Math.max(M, x), suffixSums, memo);
            maxStones = Math.max(maxStones, suffixSums[i] - opponent);
        } 
        
        memo[i][M] = maxStones;
        return maxStones;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StoneGameII game = new StoneGameII();
        int[] piles = {2, 7, 9, 4, 4};
        System.out.println(game.stoneGameII(piles));  // Output: 10
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Precomputation** (suffix sums): O(n)
- **Memoization Calculation**: Each state is defined by the index `i` and `M`, there are at most O(n^2) states, and each state requires O(n) time due to the maximum `2*M=2*n` iterations.

Overall, this solution runs in O(n^3) time, which is efficient given the problem constraints.
