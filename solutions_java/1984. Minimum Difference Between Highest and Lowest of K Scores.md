[Leetcode 1984. Minimum Difference Between Highest and Lowest of K Scores](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1984)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of integers `scores` representing the scores of a game and an integer `k`. Your task is to find the minimum difference between the highest and lowest scores in any k-subarray of `scores`. A k-subarray is a subarray of length `k`.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= k <= scores.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= scores[i] <= 10^5`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the array of scores always sorted?**
   - No, the array of scores is not necessarily sorted.
2. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - According to constraints, all numbers are non-negative.
3. **Should we return the exact minimum difference or just any valid difference within a k-size subarray?**
   - The goal is to return the exact minimum difference between the highest and lowest scores in any k-size subarray.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, you'll use the following steps:

1. **Sort the Array**:
   - First, sort the array to simplify finding k-size subarrays with the minimum range.

2. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - Use a sliding window approach to find the minimum difference between the maximum and minimum values in each subarray of length `k`.

### Code

Here is the Java implementation for the problem:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MinimumDifferenceBetweenScores {
    public int minimumDifference(int[] scores, int k) {
        // If k is 1, the minimum difference is always 0
        if (k == 1) return 0;

        // Step 1: Sort the array
        Arrays.sort(scores);

        int minDifference = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        // Step 2: Use sliding window approach
        for (int i = 0; i <= scores.length - k; i++) {
            int currentDifference = scores[i + k - 1] - scores[i];
            if (currentDifference < minDifference) {
                minDifference = currentDifference;
            }
        }

        return minDifference;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumDifferenceBetweenScores solution = new MinimumDifferenceBetweenScores();
        int[] scores = {9, 4, 1, 7};
        int k = 2;
        System.out.println(solution.minimumDifference(scores, k)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: Sorting the array takes `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the length of the array.
- **Sliding Window**: This operation runs in `O(n)`, as we slide the window across the array.

Hence, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, resulting in `O(n log n)`.

This should cover the problem comprehensively and provide a clear and efficient solution using Java.
