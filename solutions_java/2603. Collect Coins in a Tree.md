[Leetcode 2603. Collect Coins in a Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2603)
### Problem Statement
You are given a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph with no cycles) consisting of `n` nodes indexed from `0` to `n-1`. Each node has a certain number of coins associated with it. 

Your task is to collect all the coins by making the minimum number of moves. Each move allows you to travel from one node to another along the edges of the tree. You must start and end at the root node (node `0`).

Write a function that returns the minimum number of moves needed to collect all the coins.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints on `n`**
   - What is the range of `n` (the number of nodes)?
   - Are there any specific constraints on the number of coins in each node?

2. **Input Format**
   - How is the tree represented in the input? Is it an adjacency list, adjacency matrix, or list of edges?

3. **Output Format**
   - Should the function return the number of moves as an integer?

### Example
Consider the following example:

Input:
``` 
n = 3
coins = [1, 0, 1]
edges = [[0, 1], [1, 2]]
```

Output:
``` 
2
```

### Strategy
1. **Representation and Parsing**
   - Parse the number of nodes `n`, the list indicating the number of coins at each node, and the list of edges representing the tree structure.

2. **Tree Traversal**
   - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree to collect the coins.
   - Track the total number of moves needed to collect all coins.

3. **Backtracking**
   - Implement backtracking in DFS to ensure that you return to the root node after collecting coins from subtrees.

### Time Complexity
The overall time complexity should be \(O(n)\) due to the single traversal of the tree (DFS).

### Code
Here's the Java solution to solve the problem:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class CollectCoinsInTree {
    public int collectTheCoins(int n, int[] coins, int[][] edges) {
        // Step 1: Build the tree representation using an adjacency list
        List<List<Integer>> tree = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            tree.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            tree.get(edge[0]).add(edge[1]);
            tree.get(edge[1]).add(edge[0]);
        }
        
        // Simple DFS to collect coins
        return dfs(0, -1, coins, tree);
    }
    
    private int dfs(int node, int parent, int[] coins, List<List<Integer>> tree) {
        int totalMoves = 0;
        
        for (int neighbor : tree.get(node)) {
            if (neighbor != parent) {
                int moves = dfs(neighbor, node, coins, tree);
                if (coins[neighbor] > 0) {
                    totalMoves += moves + 2; // Each subtree requires two moves for entry and exit
                    coins[node] += coins[neighbor]; // Transfer coins to the parent
                }
            }
        }
        
        return totalMoves;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CollectCoinsInTree solver = new CollectCoinsInTree();
        int n = 3;
        int[] coins = {1, 0, 1};
        int[][] edges = // use example from above
        
        System.out.println(solver.collectTheCoins(n, coins, edges)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code
1. **Tree Representation**: The tree is represented using an adjacency list.
2. **DFS Function**: The `dfs` function computes the total moves required to collect coins from the entire subtree rooted at a given node.
3. **Base Case and Recursive Case**:
   - The base case handles leaf nodes.
   - For each subtree, we recursively compute the moves required and then add/subtract moves based on whether there are coins to be collected.

This solution efficiently leverages depth-first search to ensure optimal moves for collecting all coins in the tree. The tree's properties ensure that this algorithm runs efficiently within a linear time complexity.
