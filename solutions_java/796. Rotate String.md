[Leetcode 796. Rotate String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l796)
### Problem Statement

Leetcode 796: **Rotate String**

We are given two strings `s` and `goal`. We need to determine if `s` can become `goal` after a series of shifts. In one shift, `s` is moved to the left by one position. For example, if `s = "abcde"`, then it can be shifted to the left to become `"bcdea"`, `"cdeab"`, `"deabc"`, `"eabcd"`, and finally back to `"abcde"`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the lengths of `s` and `goal`?**
   - Both strings have a length ranging from `1 to 100`.

2. **Are there any specific characters allowed in the strings?**
   - The strings consist of lowercase English letters.

3. **Can the strings be of different lengths?**
   - No, for `s` to possibly be rotated into `goal`, both strings need to be of the same length.

### Strategy

To determine if `s` can become `goal` after a series of shifts:
1. **Concatenate `s` with itself**: This would allow us to check for any shifted versions within the new string.
2. **Check for substring**: If `goal` is a substring within the concatenated string, then `s` can be shifted to become `goal`.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean rotateString(String s, String goal) {
        if (s.length() != goal.length()) {
            return false;
        }
        String concatenated = s + s;
        return concatenated.contains(goal);
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Checking Length**: First, we check if `s` and `goal` have the same length. If not, return `false` since they cannot be the same string after any number of shifts.
2. **Concatenate and Check**: We concatenate `s` with itself to create a new string. If `goal` is a substring of this new string, it means that `goal` can be formed by rotating `s`.

### Time Complexity

1. **Concatenation**: Concatenating `s` with itself takes O(n) time where `n` is the length of `s`.
2. **Substring Check**: Checking if `goal` is a substring in the concatenated string can be performed in O(n) time typically (char checking would take linear time given efficient implementations).

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the strings `s` and `goal`.
