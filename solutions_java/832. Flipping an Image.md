[Leetcode 832. Flipping an Image](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l832)
### Problem Statement

The problem requires us to flip an image horizontally and then invert it.

**Flipping horizontally** means that each row of the image is reversed. For example, if the row is `[1, 0, 1]`, after flipping, it will be `[1, 0, 1]`.

**Inverting** means that each 0 is replaced by 1 and each 1 is replaced by 0. Continuing with the previous example, after inverting, `[1, 0, 1]` becomes `[0, 1, 0]`.

Given an `n x n` binary matrix `image`, we need to return the resulting matrix after performing both operations.

Example:
```
Input: image = [[1,1,0],[1,0,1],[0,0,0]]
Output: [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[1,1,1]]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Will the input always be a square matrix (n x n)?
   - The problem only specifies an `n x n` matrix, so we will assume it is true unless specified otherwise.
2. Can we modify the input matrix in place?
   - Unless otherwise specified, we can assume either in-place mutation or creating a new matrix is acceptable.

### Strategy

1. **Flipping the Image Horizontally**:
    - For each row in the matrix, reverse the elements.
  
2. **Inverting the Image**:
    - After flipping the rows, invert each element. Inverting is straightforward, as we can subtract the current element from 1.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int[][] flipAndInvertImage(int[][] image) {
        for (int[] row : image) {
            int length = row.length;
            // Flip the row by swapping elements from both ends up to the middle
            for (int i = 0; i < (length + 1) / 2; i++) {
                // Swap and invert the values
                int temp = row[i] ^ 1; // Invert while saving
                row[i] = row[length - 1 - i] ^ 1; // Invert while assigning
                row[length - 1 - i] = temp;
            }
        }
        return image;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- We traverse each element in the matrix exactly once to flip it and invert it.
- Let `n` be the number of rows and each row also has `n` columns.
- Time Complexity: **O(n^2)** because we are dealing with each element once.

### Explanation

- **Flipping**: The inner loop swaps elements from either end of the row, effectively reversing it.
- **Inverting**: During the swap, the elements are also inverted by using the XOR operation with `1` (`^ 1`). This works because `1^1 = 0` and `0^1 = 1`.
- This two-step process (flip and invert) is combined into a single loop to increase efficiency.
