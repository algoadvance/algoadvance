[Leetcode 552. Student Attendance Record II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l552)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s`, representing an attendance record for a student. The record only contains the following three characters:
- `'A'` : Absent.
- `'L'` : Late.
- `'P'` : Present.
  
A student could be rewarded if his attendance record doesn't contain more than one `'A'` (absent) and more than two continuous `'L'` (late).

You need to return the number of possible attendance records of length `n` that will be rewarded. The answer may be very large, so return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Whatâ€™s the range of `n`?**
    - `n` can be a large value, typically in the range from `1` to `10^5`.
    
2. **Should we consider consecutive 'L's greater than two only once or multiple times?**
    - Any occurrence of more than two consecutive 'L's will disqualify the record.

3. **Is the order of characters important?**
    - Yes, the specific sequence of 'A', 'L', and 'P' matters.

### Strategy

This problem can be approached using Dynamic Programming due to the overlapping subproblems nature:

1. **Base Cases:**
    - For `n = 1`: 
      - "P", "L", "A"

2. **Define DP Table:**
    - Let `dp[i][A][L]` be the number of valid attendance records of length `i` with exactly `A` number of 'A' and ending with at most `L` consecutive 'L'.

3. **Transition:**
    - Start with any valid sequence of `i-1`, and for every valid state, append 'P', 'A', or 'L', updating the states accordingly:
      - Append 'P': does not increase 'A' and resets 'L' continuous count.
      - Append 'A': increases 'A' by 1 and resets 'L' continuous count.
      - Append 'L': increases 'L' continuous count if it's less than 2.

4. **Result Calculation:**
    - Sum up all dp[n][A][L] where `A <= 1` and `L <= 2`.

Given the potential large value of `n`, the time complexity needs to be optimal, avoiding redundant calculations by caching intermediate results.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) 
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) due to the use of dynamic tables.

Here's the code implementation in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int checkRecord(int n) {
        final int MOD = 1000000007;
        int[][][] dp = new int[n + 1][2][3];  // [length][A count][L count]

        dp[0][0][0] = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
            // Ending with P (3 states)
            for (int j = 0; j < 2; ++j) {
                for (int k = 0; k < 3; ++k) {
                    dp[i][j][0] = (dp[i][j][0] + dp[i - 1][j][k]) % MOD;
                }
            }

            // Ending with A (2 states)
            for (int k = 0; k < 3; ++k) {
                dp[i][1][0] = (dp[i][1][0] + dp[i - 1][0][k]) % MOD;
            }

            // Ending with L (5 states)
            for (int j = 0; j < 2; ++j) {
                for (int k = 1; k < 3; ++k) {
                    dp[i][j][k] = (dp[i][j][k] + dp[i - 1][j][k - 1]) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }

        int ans = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < 2; ++j) {
            for (int k = 0; k < 3; ++k) {
                ans = (ans + dp[n][j][k]) % MOD;
            }
        }

        return ans;
    }
}
```

This solution constructs possible attendance records dynamically and maintains constraints efficiently, ensuring optimal performance within provided constraints.
