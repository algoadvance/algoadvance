[Leetcode 1404. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number in Binary Representation to One](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1404)
### Problem Statement

Given a number `s` in binary format (`s` is a binary string), return the number of steps to reduce it to `1` under the following conditions:
1. If the number is even, divide it by `2`.
2. If the number is odd, add `1` to it.

The steps should be performed until the number becomes `1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: What is the maximum length of the binary string `s`?
2. **Output**: Can I confirm that the output should be a single integer representing the number of steps?

### Given Example
- Example 1:
  - Input: `s = "1101"`
  - Output: `6`
  - Explanation: 
    - "1101" is 13 in decimal.
    - Step 1: Add `1` (because 13 is odd) -> "1110" (14 in decimal).
    - Step 2: Divide by `2` -> "111" (7 in decimal).
    - Step 3: Add `1` -> "1000" (8 in decimal).
    - Step 4: Divide by `2` -> "100" (4 in decimal).
    - Step 5: Divide by `2` -> "10" (2 in decimal).
    - Step 6: Divide by `2` -> "1" (1 in decimal).

### Strategy
1. **Iterate through the steps**:
   - Initialize a counter for steps.
   - While the binary string `s` is not "1":
     - If the last character of `s` is '0', it means `s` is even, so "divide by 2" operation can be simulated by removing the last character.
     - If the last character is '1', it means `s` is odd, so "add 1" operation can be simulated by incrementing the binary string using binary string addition.

2. **Binary Addition Handling**:
   - If `s` is "1", add `1` results in adding a carry that might change multiple bits in the string. The increment operation should be handled carefully.

3. **Simulate Division**:
   - Simply truncate the last character of the string when dividing by 2.

### Time Complexity
- Each step either divides the length of the string or involves flipping bits and carrying over carries. Hence, the overall complexity should be O(n) where n is the length of the input string.

### Code
```java
public class NumberOfSteps {
    public static int numSteps(String s) {
        int steps = 0;
        
        while (!s.equals("1")) {
            if (s.charAt(s.length() - 1) == '0') {
                // Even case: simply divide by 2, i.e., remove the last character
                s = s.substring(0, s.length() - 1);
            } else {
                // Odd case: we need to add 1
                s = addOne(s);
            }
            steps++;
        }
        
        return steps;
    }
    
    private static String addOne(String s) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(s);
        int carry = 1;
        
        for (int i = sb.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (sb.charAt(i) == '1') {
                sb.setCharAt(i, '0');
            } else {
                sb.setCharAt(i, '1');
                carry = 0;
                break;
            }
        }
        
        if (carry == 1) {
            sb.insert(0, '1');
        }
        
        return sb.toString();
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "1101";
        System.out.println(numSteps(s));  // Output: 6
    }
}
```

### Explanation on Key Operations:
- **Binary String Manipulation**:
  - `addOne`: This function mimics binary addition for the cases when the string represents an odd number, taking care of the carry.
  - Dividing by two in binary (right shift operation) is simply removing the last character if it is '0'.

By following this approach, we reduce the binary number step-by-step until it becomes `1`, ensuring each step follows the required operations.
