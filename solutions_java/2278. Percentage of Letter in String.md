[Leetcode 2278. Percentage of Letter in String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2278)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` and a character `letter`. Your task is to return the percentage of characters in `s` that equal `letter` rounded down to the nearest whole percent.

The formula to calculate the percentage is:
\[ \text{percentage} = \left(\frac{\text{number of occurrences of `letter`}}{\text{length of `s`}}\right) \times 100 \]

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the length range of the string `s`? (Typically, constraints might be 1 <= |s| <= 100)
   - Is the string `s` always non-empty?
   - Can `s` contain non-alphabetic characters?

2. **Case Sensitivity:**
   - Should the character matching be case sensitive or insensitive? (Assuming case sensitive unless specified otherwise)

3. **Output Rounding:**
   - Should the percentage be rounded down to the nearest whole number after the calculation? (Assuming yes, based on the problem statement)

### Strategy
1. **Count Occurrences:** Iterate through the string `s` to count the occurrences of `letter`.
2. **Calculate Percentage:** Use the formula to calculate the percentage.
3. **Round Down:** Use integer division to round down the percentage to the nearest whole number.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of string `s`. This is because we need to iterate through the string once to count the occurrences of `letter`.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int percentageLetter(String s, char letter) {
        int count = 0;
        int length = s.length();
        
        // Count the occurrences of `letter` in the string
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == letter) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        // Calculate the percentage and round down using integer division
        int percentage = (count * 100) / length;
        
        return percentage;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        // Test cases
        System.out.println(solution.percentageLetter("foobar", 'o'));    // Expected output: 33
        System.out.println(solution.percentageLetter("jjjj", 'j'));      // Expected output: 100
        System.out.println(solution.percentageLetter("abcde", 'f'));     // Expected output: 0
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Counting Occurrences:**
   - We initialize `count` to zero.
   - We iterate through each character of the string `s` and increment `count` whenever we find the character `letter`.

2. **Calculating Percentage:**
   - The percentage is computed using the formula \((\text{count} \times 100) / \text{length}\).
   - Since we're using integer division, this automatically rounds down the percentage.

3. **Return Result:**
   - The computed percentage is then returned as an integer.

This way, we can effectively compute the percentage of occurrences of a given character in a string, rounded down to the nearest whole percentage.
