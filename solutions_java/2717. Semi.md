[Leetcode 2717. Semi](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2717)
### Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed permutation of integers `nums` (1-indexed) of length `n`. A permutation means `nums` contains each integer from `1` to `n` exactly once.

A permutation is called semi-ordered if the first number equals 1 and the last number equals `n`. More formally, for a permutation `nums` it is semi-ordered if `nums[0] == 1` and `nums[n - 1] == n`.

You are allowed to perform any number of operations, where in each operation you can choose any two adjacent elements of `nums` and swap them.

Return the minimum number of operations to make `nums` semi-ordered.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input permutation ever be empty?
   - No, the length `n` of the permutation will be at least 1 as per the problem statement.
   
2. What is the range of the length `n` of the permutation?
   - The problem does not specify a range, but you may assume typical constraints like 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5 for competitive programming.

3. Are duplicates allowed in the permutation?
   - No, by definition, a permutation of length `n` contains each integer from `1` to `n` exactly once.

4. Should variations of the same permutation be considered different?
   - Yes, since the problem explicitly focuses on the position of `1` and `n`.

### Strategy
1. Find the positions of `1` and `n` in the array.
2. Calculate the number of adjacent swaps needed to move `1` to the start of the array (`index at 0`).
3. Calculate the number of adjacent swaps needed to move `n` to the end of the array (`index at n-1`).
4. Depending on whether the position of `1` is before or after `n`, we may need to subtract one swap because moving `1` left might free up the slot that `n` moves into.
5. Summing up these operations will give the minimum number of required operations.

### Code
```java
public class SemiOrderedPermutation {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int index1 = -1, indexN = -1;

        // Find indices of 1 and n
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == 1) {
                index1 = i;
            } else if (nums[i] == n) {
                indexN = i;
            }
        }

        // Calculate number of swaps needed to move 1 to the start
        int swapsFor1 = index1;

        // Calculate number of swaps needed to move n to the end
        int swapsForN = (n - 1) - indexN;

        // If 1 is before n, n moving will occupy the freed slot by moving 1
        if (index1 < indexN) {
            return swapsFor1 + swapsForN;
        } else {
            return swapsFor1 + swapsForN - 1;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SemiOrderedPermutation sol = new SemiOrderedPermutation();
        int[] nums = {2, 4, 1, 3};
        System.out.println(sol.minOperations(nums)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Finding the indices of `1` and `n` takes O(n).
- Calculating the number of swaps is O(1).
- Hence, the overall time complexity is O(n).

### Explanation
- The algorithm efficiently finds the positions of `1` and `n` and computes the minimum swaps needed based on their positions.
- The edge case where `1` and `n` are already in proper positions is implicitly handled since the operations would result in zero swaps.
