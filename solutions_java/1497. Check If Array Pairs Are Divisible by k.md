[Leetcode 1497. Check If Array Pairs Are Divisible by k](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1497)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `k`, you need to determine if you can divide this array into pairs such that the sum of each pair is divisible by `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `k` be zero?**
   - No, typically `k` will be non-zero as division by zero is undefined.

2. **Is the array guaranteed to contain an even number of elements?**
   - Yes, the problem assumes that it is possible to pair the entire array, so the array length must be even.

3. **Are negative numbers allowed in the array?**
   - Yes, negative numbers can be in the array, and they should be handled appropriately in pairing for divisibility.

### Strategy

1. **Understanding Remainders:**
   - For any integer `a`, `a % k` gives the remainder when `a` is divided by `k`. For the sum of two numbers `a` and `b`, `(a + b) % k == 0` if the sum of their remainders is `k` or 0.

2. **Frequency Counts:**
   - Count the frequency of each remainder when the elements of `arr` are divided by `k`.
   - Use a map or an array to store these frequency counts.

3. **Pairing Logic:**
   - For elements with remainder `0`, they must be paired among themselves.
   - For other remainders `r`, the frequency of `r` must match the frequency of `k-r`.

### Code

Here is the implementation of the above logic in Java:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class ArrayPairsDivisibleByK {
    public boolean canArrange(int[] arr, int k) {
        if (arr.length % 2 != 0) {
            return false;
        }
        
        Map<Integer, Integer> remainderFreq = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Step 1: Count the frequency of each remainder
        for (int num : arr) {
            int remainder = ((num % k) + k) % k; // handling negatives correctly
            remainderFreq.put(remainder, remainderFreq.getOrDefault(remainder, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        // Step 2: Check the pairing condition
        for (int remainder : remainderFreq.keySet()) {
            int freq = remainderFreq.get(remainder);
            if (remainder == 0) {
                // If remainder is 0, then there must be an even number of such elements
                if (freq % 2 != 0) {
                    return false;
                }
            } else {
                // freq of remainder should be equal to freq of (k - remainder)
                int counterpart = (k - remainder) % k;
                if (freq != remainderFreq.getOrDefault(counterpart, 0)) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ArrayPairsDivisibleByK solution = new ArrayPairsDivisibleByK();
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 10, 6, -8};
        int k = 5;
        System.out.println(solution.canArrange(arr, k)); // Output: true
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in `arr`. We iterate over the array once to compute the remainders and once more to check the condition.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(k)`, for storing the frequency of remainders in the hash map.

This solution efficiently checks whether the array can be divided into pairs whose sums are divisible by `k`.
