[Leetcode 556. Next Greater Element III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l556)
### Problem Statement

Given a positive integer `n`, find the smallest integer which has exactly the same digits existing in the integer `n` and is greater in value than `n`. If no such positive integer exists, return `-1`.

**Example:**
1. Input: n = 12
   Output: 21

2. Input: n = 21
   Output: -1

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can `n` contain leading zeros?
   **A:** No, `n` will be a positive integer with no leading zeros.

2. **Q:** What is the range of `n`?
   **A:** The constraint is not explicitly given, but assume it will fit within the bounds of a 32-bit signed integer (`1 <= n <= 2^31 - 1`).

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we follow these steps:
1. **Identify the Pivot:** From the right, find the first digit that is smaller than its next digit. Let this digit be at index `i`.
2. **Find the Swap Candidate:** From the right, find the smallest digit that is larger than the digit at index `i` and swap them.
3. **Reverse the Suffix:** Reverse the digits to the right of index `i` to get the smallest lexicographical order.

Here are the detailed steps:
1. Convert the integer `n` to a character array `arr` for easy manipulation of digits.
2. Traverse the array from the second last element to the start to find the first decreasing element; index `i`.
3. If no such element is found, return `-1`.
4. Traverse the array from the end to find the smallest digit larger than `arr[i]` and swap them.
5. Reverse the sub-array starting from `i + 1` to the end.
6. Convert the character array back to an integer.
7. If the result exceeds 32-bit integer range, return `-1`.

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int nextGreaterElement(int n) {
        char[] number = Integer.toString(n).toCharArray();
        
        int i = number.length - 2;
        // Step 1: Find first decreasing digit
        while (i >= 0 && number[i] >= number[i + 1]) {
            i--;
        }
        
        // If no such element is found, return -1
        if (i < 0) return -1;
        
        int j = number.length - 1;
        // Step 2: Find the next larger digit to swap with
        while (number[j] <= number[i]) {
            j--;
        }
        
        // Step 3: Swap the elements
        swap(number, i, j);
        
        // Step 4: Reverse the digits after index i
        reverse(number, i + 1, number.length - 1);
        
        // Convert back to integer and be cautious with overflow
        try {
            return Integer.parseInt(new String(number));
        } catch (NumberFormatException e) {
            return -1;
        }
    }
    
    private void swap(char[] arr, int i, int j) {
        char temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[j];
        arr[j] = temp;
    }
    
    private void reverse(char[] arr, int start, int end) {
        while (start < end) {
            swap(arr, start, end);
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is O(d) where `d` is the number of digits in the number `n`. This is because we are performing a couple of linear scans (to find the pivot and the swap candidate) and one reverse operation.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(d) due to the storage of the number as a character array.

This approach ensures that we effectively find the next greater permutation with the least lexicographical order in a constrained time frame.
