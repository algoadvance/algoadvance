[Leetcode 950. Reveal Cards In Increasing Order](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l950)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `deck`. There is a deck of cards where every card has a unique integer. The order in which the cards are given is not revealed to you. We need to reveal the cards in a particular manner:

1. Order the deck in increasing order.
2. Take the top card of the deck, reveal it, and put it in the result list.
3. If there are any cards left in the deck, put the next top card at the bottom of the deck.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until all cards are revealed.

Return the ordering of the deck that would reveal the cards in increasing order.

Example:
```
Input: deck = [17,13,11,2,3,5,7]
Output: [2,13,3,11,5,17,7]
Explanation: 
We get the order [2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17] (increasing order), and generate the output step by step:
1. Reveal 2, deck rearranged: [3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17]
2. Move 3 to the bottom: [5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 3]
3. Reveal 5, deck rearranged: [7, 11, 13, 17, 3]
4. Move 7 to the bottom: [11, 13, 17, 3, 7]
5. Reveal 11, deck rearranged: [13, 17, 3, 7]
6. Move 13 to the bottom: [17, 3, 7, 13]
7. Reveal 17, deck rearranged: [3, 7, 13]
8. Move 3 to the bottom: [7, 13, 3]
9. Reveal 7, deck rearranged: [13, 3]
10. Move 13 to the bottom: [3, 13]
11. Reveal 3
12. Reveal 13
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints:** What is the maximum length of the `deck`? (Typical constraint questions)
2. **Output format:** Should the output match the example format as a list of integers?
3. **Unique values:** Can it be confirmed that each card has a unique integer?

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Deck:** First, we sort the deck in increasing order.
2. **Simulate the process:** Create a result list with the same size as the deck initialized with zeros. Use a deque to simulate the process of revealing cards and moving cards to the bottom.
3. **Populate positions:** For each card in the sorted deck, we place it in the correct position using a queue.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the strategy in Java:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public class RevealCardsInIncreasingOrder {
    public static int[] deckRevealedIncreasing(int[] deck) {
        // Number of cards
        int N = deck.length;
        
        // Sort the deck first
        Arrays.sort(deck);
        
        // This queue will help to simulate the revealing process
        Queue<Integer> indexQueue = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            indexQueue.add(i);
        }
        
        // This array will hold the final result
        int[] result = new int[N];
        
        for (int card : deck) {
            // Place the next card in the position indicated by the queue
            result[indexQueue.poll()] = card;
            if (!indexQueue.isEmpty()) {
                // Move the next index to the bottom of the queue
                indexQueue.add(indexQueue.poll());
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] deck = {17, 13, 11, 2, 3, 5, 7};
        int[] result = deckRevealedIncreasing(deck);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(result)); // Output: [2, 13, 3, 11, 5, 17, 7]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** The time complexity for sorting the deck is \(O(N \log N)\), where \(N\) is the number of cards.
- **Simulation:** Maintaining and manipulating the queue has a complexity of \(O(N)\).
- **Overall:** The overall time complexity is \(O(N \log N) + O(N)\), which simplifies to \(O(N \log N)\).

This complexity is efficient and should work well within typical constraints for such problems.
