[Leetcode 1790. Check if One String Swap Can Make Strings Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1790)
### Problem Statement

Given two strings `s1` and `s2` of equal length, return `true` if you can swap two letters in `s1` such that the result is equal to `s2`; otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the strings have special characters or are they limited to only lowercase letters?**
   - The problem does not specify, but typically such problems involve lowercase letters.
   
2. **Is it guaranteed that the lengths of `s1` and `s2` are equal?**
   - Yes, it is mentioned in the problem statement.

3. **Do the two letters to swap have to be different?**
   - No, the two letters can be the same as long as the swap results in the strings being equal.

### Strategy

1. **Check if Lengths are Equal**: Since the lengths are guaranteed to be equal, this check is not required.
2. **Identify Mismatched Positions**: Iterate through both strings and collect the positions where the characters differ.
3. **Validate the Number of Mismatches**:
   - If there are exactly two mismatched positions, check if swapping these mismatched indices in `s1` makes it equal to `s2`.
   - If there are zero mismatched positions, it means the strings are already equal, so no swap is needed.
   - Any other number of mismatched positions will result in a `false` output.
   
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Strings with length 1 should immediately return `false` (if they are not identical).
   - If both strings are identical, then they technically already satisfy the conditions of the problem.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean areAlmostEqual(String s1, String s2) {
        if (s1.length() != s2.length()) {
            return false;
        }
        
        int n = s1.length();
        List<Integer> diff = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (s1.charAt(i) != s2.charAt(i)) {
                diff.add(i);
            }
        }
        
        // If there are no differences, the strings are already same
        if (diff.size() == 0) {
            return true;
        }
        
        // If there are exactly 2 differences, check if swapping them would make the strings equal
        if (diff.size() == 2) {
            int i = diff.get(0), j = diff.get(1);
            return s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(j) && s1.charAt(j) == s2.charAt(i);
        }
        
        return false;  // For any other number of differences
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the strings. This is because we only make a single pass through both strings to identify mismatched positions and perform constant-time checks.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is **O(1)** for the auxiliary space used (ignoring the space used by the input strings themselves). The list `diff` can only hold at most 2 indices, making its additional space usage constant.
