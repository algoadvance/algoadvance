[Leetcode 2397. Maximum Rows Covered by Columns](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2397)
### Problem Statement

You are given a binary matrix `mat` of size `m x n` and an integer `cols`. This matrix represents a grid where each cell is either 0 representing an empty cell or 1 representing a filled cell. You need to select exactly `cols` columns such that the maximum number of rows in the matrix are covered. A row is covered if every cell in that row is a filled cell (1) for the selected columns.

Return the maximum number of rows that can be covered by selecting `cols` columns.

**Example:**
```
Input:
mat = [[1,0,0,1,0],
       [0,1,1,0,1],
       [0,0,0,1,1],
       [1,0,1,1,0]], cols = 2
       
Output: 3
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. If a cell in the matrix is `0`, does it mean that it must not be selected for a row to be considered covered?
2. Are there any constraints on the size of the matrix (m and n)?
3. Can columns be selected in any order or does the order matter?

### Strategy
1. **Identify the Subsets of Columns:** We need to check all possible combinations of `cols` columns. This suggests a combinatorial approach.
  
2. **Cover Calculation:** For each combination, count the number of rows which will be fully covered by the chosen columns.

3. **Generate Combinations:** Use combinations to generate all possible ways to choose `cols` columns out of `n`.

4. **Iterate and Check:** For each combination of columns, iterate through the rows and check how many rows are fully covered by the chosen columns.

5. **Max Rows Covered:** Keep track of the maximum number of rows covered across all combinations of columns.

### Time Complexity

- Generating all combinations of columns is `O(C(n, cols))` which can be approximated as `O(n^cols)`.
- For each combination, we iterate over `m` rows and `cols` columns leading to `O(m * cols)` checks per combination.

Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(C(n, cols) * m * cols)`.

### Code Implementation

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class MaximumRowsCoveredByColumns {
    
    public static int maximumRows(int[][] mat, int cols) {
        int m = mat.length;
        int n = mat[0].length;
        
        List<int[]> combinations = combine(n, cols);
        int maxCoveredRows = 0;

        // Evaluate each combination of columns
        for (int[] combination : combinations) {
            int coveredRows = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
                boolean isCovered = true;
                for (int column : combination) {
                    if (mat[i][column] == 0) {
                        isCovered = false;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (isCovered) {
                    coveredRows++;
                }
            }
            maxCoveredRows = Math.max(maxCoveredRows, coveredRows);
        }
        return maxCoveredRows;
    }
    
    private static List<int[]> combine(int n, int k) {
        List<int[]> combinations = new ArrayList<>();
        combineHelper(0, n, k, new int[k], 0, combinations);
        return combinations;
    }
    
    private static void combineHelper(int start, int n, int k, int[] combo, int idx, List<int[]> combinations) {
        if (idx == k) {
            combinations.add(combo.clone());
            return;
        }
        for (int i = start; i < n; i++) {
            combo[idx] = i;
            combineHelper(i + 1, n, k, combo, idx + 1, combinations);
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] mat = {
            {1, 0, 0, 1, 0},
            {0, 1, 1, 0, 1},
            {0, 0, 0, 1, 1},
            {1, 0, 1, 1, 0}
        };
        int cols = 2;
        
        System.out.println(maximumRows(mat, cols)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

This solution generates all combinations of columns, checks which rows are covered, and returns the maximum number of rows that can be covered.
