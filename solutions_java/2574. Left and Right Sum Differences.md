[Leetcode 2574. Left and Right Sum Differences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2574)
## Problem Statement

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, find a **0-indexed** integer array `answer` where:

- `answer.length == nums.length`.
- `answer[i] = |leftSum[i] - rightSum[i]|`.

Where:
- `leftSum[i]` is the sum of elements to the left of index `i` in the array `nums`. If there is no such element, `leftSum[i]` is `0`.
- `rightSum[i]` is the sum of elements to the right of index `i` in the array `nums`. If there is no such element, `rightSum[i]` is `0`.

Return the `answer` array.

### Example 1
```
Input: nums = [10,4,8,3]
Output: [15,1,11,22]

Explanation:
- For index 0, leftSum is [], rightSum is [4,8,3], and |0 - 15| = 15.
- For index 1, leftSum is [10], rightSum is [8,3], and |10 - 11| = 1.
- For index 2, leftSum is [10,4], rightSum is [3], and |14 - 3| = 11.
- For index 3, leftSum is [10,4,8], rightSum is [], and |22 - 0| = 22.
```

### Example 2
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [10,8,6,4]

Explanation:
- For index 0, leftSum is [], rightSum is [2,3,4], and |0 - 9| = 9.
- For index 1, leftSum is [1], rightSum is [3,4], and |1 - 7| = 6.
- For index 2, leftSum is [1,2], rightSum is [4], and |3 - 4| = 1.
- For index 3, leftSum is [1,2,3], rightSum is [], and |6 - 0| = 6.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input array be empty?
2. What are the constraints on the elements of the input array?

## Strategy
1. **Initialize Sum Variables**: Use two arrays, one for the cumulative left sums (`leftSum`) and one for the cumulative right sums (`rightSum`).
2. **Compute Left Sums**: Traverse the array from left to right to compute the left sums.
3. **Compute Right Sums**: Traverse the array from right to left to compute the right sums.
4. **Calculate Answer**: Use the left and right sums to compute the absolute differences and store them in the `answer` array.
5. **Return Result**: Return the `answer` array.

## Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] leftRightDifference(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] leftSum = new int[n];
        int[] rightSum = new int[n];
        int[] answer = new int[n];
        
        // Calculate left sums
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            leftSum[i] = leftSum[i - 1] + nums[i - 1];
        }
        
        // Calculate right sums
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            rightSum[i] = rightSum[i + 1] + nums[i + 1];
        }
        
        // Calculate answer array
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            answer[i] = Math.abs(leftSum[i] - rightSum[i]);
        }
        
        return answer;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because we are iterating through the array three times: once for calculating `leftSum`, once for calculating `rightSum`, and once for computing the `answer`.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` due to the additional arrays `leftSum` and `rightSum`.

This solution efficiently computes the required difference arrays with linear time complexity and minimal extra space.
