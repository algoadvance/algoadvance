[Leetcode 2871. Split Array Into Maximum Number of Subarrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2871)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums`. You need to split the array into the maximum number of non-empty subarrays (continuous subarrays), such that each element in the array is part of exactly one subarray, and each subarray has at most one peak.

A peak is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors.

Return the maximum number of subarrays you can fit satisfying the condition.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the range of the number of elements in the array?
   - Typically, how large can the array get?

2. **Output**: What should be returned?
   - Number of subarrays.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - What should be done if the array is empty?
   - How to handle arrays with no peaks at all?

### Strategy

1. **Definitions**
   - A peak is an element `nums[i]` where `nums[i-1] < nums[i] > nums[i+1]`.

2. **Approach**:
   - Traverse the array and identify peaks.
   - Split the array wherever a peak is found.
   - Ensure each subarray contains at most one peak.

3. **Detailed Steps**:
   - Traverse the `nums` array while maintaining a list of subarrays.
   - Whenever a peak is identified, split and start a new subarray.
   - Continue this until the end of the array.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxSubarraysWithOnePeak(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        int n = nums.length;
        int subarrayCount = 0;
        boolean inSubarray = false;
        boolean hasPeak = false;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!inSubarray) {
                inSubarray = true;
                subarrayCount++;
                hasPeak = false;
            }

            if (i > 0 && i < n - 1 && nums[i] > nums[i - 1] && nums[i] > nums[i + 1]) {
                if (hasPeak) {
                    inSubarray = false;
                    hasPeak = false;
                    i--; // re-evaluate the current position in the next subarray
                } else {
                    hasPeak = true;
                }
            }
        }

        return subarrayCount;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        // Example test cases
        System.out.println(solution.maxSubarraysWithOnePeak(new int[]{1, 3, 2, 4, 3, 5, 1})); // 3
        System.out.println(solution.maxSubarraysWithOnePeak(new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5})); // 1
        System.out.println(solution.maxSubarraysWithOnePeak(new int[]{5, 4, 3, 2, 1})); // 5
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The algorithm runs in O(n) time, where n is the number of elements in the array.
- This efficiency is achieved because we only make a single pass through the array to identify and handle peaks.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space for variables.
