[Leetcode 1626. Best Team With No Conflicts](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1626)
### Problem Statement

You are the manager of a basketball team. For the upcoming tournament, you want to choose the team with the highest overall score. The score of the team is the sum of scores of all the players in the team.

However, the team must be chosen with the following rule:
- The age of the players must be strictly increasing when you consider the score of the players.

You are given two lists, `scores` and `ages`, where `scores[i]` and `ages[i]` represent the score and age of the `i`-th player, respectively.

Return the highest overall score of all possible basketball teams that do not have conflicts.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can two players have the same age and score?
2. Do we need to consider any edge case scenarios, like empty input lists?
3. Is it possible to have only one player on the team?
4. Should the age be "strictly" increasing or "non-decreasing"?

### Strategy

1. **Data sorting:** First, pair each playerâ€™s age with their score, then sort these pairs. Sorting will help in handling the age constraints. If ages are the same, we can sort by score to simplify the problem.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:** 
   - Define a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the highest score achievable including the player `i` and any qualifying players before `i`.
   - Iterate through the list, and for each player, iterate all previous players and update the `dp` array where the current player can be included to maximize the score without violating the age constraint.

3. **Final answer:** The maximum value in the `dp` array will be the answer.

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the data pairs takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- Populating the `dp` array takes \(O(n^2)\).

Hence, the overall time complexity is \(O(n^2)\).

### Code

Here is the detailed Java solution implementing the above strategy:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class BestTeamNoConflicts {
    public int bestTeamScore(int[] scores, int[] ages) {
        int n = scores.length;
        Player[] players = new Player[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            players[i] = new Player(scores[i], ages[i]);
        }
        
        Arrays.sort(players, (a, b) -> (a.age == b.age) ? Integer.compare(a.score, b.score) : Integer.compare(a.age, b.age));
        
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        int maxScore = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = players[i].score;
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (players[i].score >= players[j].score) {
                    dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + players[i].score);
                }
            }
            maxScore = Math.max(maxScore, dp[i]);
        }
        
        return maxScore;
    }
    
    private class Player {
        int score;
        int age;
        
        Player(int score, int age) {
            this.score = score;
            this.age = age;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BestTeamNoConflicts solution = new BestTeamNoConflicts();
        int[] scores = {4, 5, 6, 5};
        int[] ages = {2, 1, 2, 1};
        
        System.out.println(solution.bestTeamScore(scores, ages)); // Output: 16
    }
}
```

This code first creates a `Player` class to encapsulate the player's age and score. The players are then sorted primarily by age and secondarily by score if ages are the same. The dynamic programming approach is used to find the maximum score for any valid team configuration.
