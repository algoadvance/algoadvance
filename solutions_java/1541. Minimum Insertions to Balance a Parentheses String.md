[Leetcode 1541. Minimum Insertions to Balance a Parentheses String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1541)
## Problem Statement
Given a parentheses string `s` containing only the characters `(` and `)`. A parentheses string is balanced if:
1. Any left parenthesis `(` has a corresponding two consecutive right parenthesis `))`.
2. Left parenthesis `(` must go before the corresponding right parenthesis `))`.

In other words, we treat `(` as opening a piece of code block that is effectively closed by `))`. The task is to return the minimum number of insertions needed to balance the parentheses string.

### Examples:

1. **Input:** `s = "(()))"`  
   **Output:** `1`  
   **Explanation:** The string can be balanced by inserting one `)` at the end.

2. **Input:** `s = "())"`  
   **Output:** `0`  
   **Explanation:** The string is already balanced.

3. **Input:** `s = "))())("`  
   **Output:** `3`  
   **Explanation:** The string can be balanced by inserting three `(` at the beginning and one `)` at the end to become `((())))))`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Will the input string always contain only `(` and `)`?
   **A:** Yes, the input string contains only `(` and `)`.

2. **Q:** Can the input string be empty?
   **A:** Yes, the input string can be empty and if it is, the output should be 0 since it is already balanced.

3. **Q:** Is there a maximum length for the input string?
   **A:** For this problem, we can assume the input string length falls within typical constraints, usually up to 10^5 characters.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to maintain two variables:
1. `openRequired` - This keeps track of how many `(` are required.
2. `insertions` - This counts the number of insertions needed to balance the string.

We iterate through the string character by character and simulate fixing the string:
1. For each `(` encountered, increment `openRequired`.
2. For each `)` encountered:
   - If another `)` follows, pair them up.
   - If a single `)` is encountered, check if prepending or appending another `)` balances it with existing pending opens or requires more `(`.

We balance the string as we go and return the total number of insertions needed.

## Time Complexity
The solution has a time complexity of `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the string because we are processing each character in the string exactly once.

## Code
```java
public class MinimumInsertionsToBalanceParentheses {
    public int minInsertions(String s) {
        int openRequired = 0; // Tracks number of `(` needed
        int insertions = 0; // Tracks total insertions required

        int i = 0;
        while (i < s.length()) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '(') {
                openRequired++;
            } else { // s.charAt(i) == ')'
                if (i + 1 < s.length() && s.charAt(i + 1) == ')') {
                    // If next character is also `)`, it's a pair `))`
                    i++;
                } else {
                    // Only one `)` found, so we need an extra `)` to make it `))`
                    insertions++;
                }

                if (openRequired > 0) {
                    openRequired--; // Use one of the pending open `(`
                } else {
                    // No open `(` available, so we need one `(`
                    insertions++;
                }
            }
            i++;
        }

        // Any open `(` still needed should be closed by adding `))` for each
        insertions += 2 * openRequired;

        return insertions;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumInsertionsToBalanceParentheses solution = new MinimumInsertionsToBalanceParentheses();
        System.out.println(solution.minInsertions("(()))")); // Output: 1
        System.out.println(solution.minInsertions("())")); // Output: 0
        System.out.println(solution.minInsertions("))())(")); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

This approach ensures that the string is balanced by counting the necessary insertions, considering paired and single parenthesis implications.
