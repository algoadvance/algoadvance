[Leetcode 873. Length of Longest Fibonacci Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l873)
### Problem Statement
Given a strictly increasing array `arr` of positive integers forming a sequence, you need to find the length of the longest Fibonacci-like subsequence of `arr`. If one does not exist, return `0`.

A Fibonacci-like sequence is a sequence `X` such that:
- `X[i] + X[i+1] = X[i+2]` for all `i + 2 < len(X)`.

For example, `[1, 3, 7, 11, 12, 14, 18]` can form the Fibonacci-like sequence `[1, 11, 12, 23]`.

#### Example
- Input: `arr = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]`
- Output: `5`
- Explanation: The longest Fibonacci-like subsequence is `[1,2,3,5,8]`.

### Clarifying Questions
- Can the array contain duplicate elements? 
  - No, the array is strictly increasing.
- What is the expected size of the input array?
  - The array size can be up to 1000.

### Strategy
To find the length of the longest Fibonacci-like subsequence, we will use dynamic programming along with hashing:
1. Create a map that maps each element to its index for quick lookup.
2. Use a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the Fibonacci-like subsequence that ends with `arr[i]` and `arr[j]`.
3. Iterate through pairs of indices `(i, j)` and for each pair, use the map to find if there exists a previous element `arr[k]` such that `arr[k] + arr[i] = arr[j]`.
4. Update the DP table accordingly.
5. Keep track of the maximum length found during the process.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class LengthOfLongestFibonacciSubsequence {
    public int lenLongestFibSubseq(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        Map<Integer, Integer> indexMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            indexMap.put(arr[i], i);
        }

        int[][] dp = new int[n][n];
        int maxLen = 0;

        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < j; i++) {
                int k = indexMap.getOrDefault(arr[j] - arr[i], -1);
                if (k >= 0 && k < i) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[k][i] + 1;
                    maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, dp[i][j] + 2);
                }
            }
        }

        return maxLen > 2 ? maxLen : 0;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LengthOfLongestFibonacciSubsequence solver = new LengthOfLongestFibonacciSubsequence();
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
        System.out.println(solver.lenLongestFibSubseq(arr)); // Output: 5
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is \(O(n^2)\) where \(n\) is the number of elements in the input array `arr`. The nested loops are over pairs of indices, and each lookup in the map is \(O(1)\) on average.
- The space complexity is \(O(n^2)\) for the DP array, and \(O(n)\) for the map.

This approach efficiently finds the length of the longest Fibonacci-like subsequence in polynomial time.
