[Leetcode 3228. Maximum Number of Operations to Move Ones to the End](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3228)
### Problem Statement

The goal is to calculate the maximum number of adjacent swaps needed to move all the ones in an array to the end of that array.

Given an array `nums` which only contains 0s and 1s, you need to return an integer representing the maximum number of adjacent swaps required to move all 1s to the end.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if the array is already full of ones or zeroes?**
   - You should return `0` since no swaps are needed.

2. **What is the expected input size?**
   - Typical constraints range from 1 to 10^5 elements in the array.

3. **Is the array mutable?**
   - No need for the original array to be modified, we just need to calculate the number of swaps.

### Strategy

1. **Identify the Maximum Number of Adjacent Swaps:**
   - To achieve this, count the number of zeros to the left of each one in the array.
   - Aggregate these counts to get the total number of swaps.

### Approach

1. Traverse the array and count the number of zeros encountered so far.
2. For each one encountered in the array, add the current count of zeros to the total number of swaps.
3. Return the total number of swaps needed.

### Code

```java
public class MaximumNumberOfOperations {
    public int minMoves(int[] nums) {
        int zeroCount = 0;
        int swaps = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == 0) {
                zeroCount++;
            } else { // num == 1
                swaps += zeroCount;
            }
        }

        return swaps;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximumNumberOfOperations operations = new MaximumNumberOfOperations();
        // Example usage
        int[] nums1 = {1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1};
        int[] nums2 = {1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0};
        int[] nums3 = {0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1};
        System.out.println(operations.minMoves(nums1)); // Output: 6
        System.out.println(operations.minMoves(nums2)); // Output: 0
        System.out.println(operations.minMoves(nums3)); // Output: 0
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of elements in the input array. We traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) since we use only a few extra variables for counting.

This approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the maximum number of adjacent swaps needed to move all ones to the end of the array.
