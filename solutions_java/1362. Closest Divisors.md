[Leetcode 1362. Closest Divisors](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1362)
## Problem Statement

1362. **Closest Divisors**

Given an integer `num`, find two integers in the range [1, num+2] whose product is either `num+1` or `num+2` and whose absolute difference is the smallest among all pairs satisfying these conditions.

Return the pair of integers in any order.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `num` be negative?**
   - The problem statement implies that `num` is a positive integer.

2. **What is the range for `num`?**
   - The problem will specify its range, but usually, `num` is a non-negative integer.

3. **Is there any restriction on how to return the pair?**
   - The pair can be returned in any order.

4. **Should we care about performance constraints?**
   - Yes, we should aim for an optimal solution since `num` can be quite large.

## Strategy

1. **Identify candidate numbers:**
   - We have two numbers to consider: `num+1` and `num+2`.
  
2. **Find closest divisors for each candidate:**
   - For each candidate, find the pair of divisors whose product equals the candidate and which have the minimal absolute difference.
  
3. **Evaluate all divisor pairs for both numbers:**
   - We iterate up to the square root of the number to find divisor pairs.
  
4. **Compare results from the two candidates:**
   - We evaluate which pair of divisors (from `num+1` or `num+2`) has the smallest absolute difference.
  
5. **Return the optimal pair of divisors:**
   - Return the pair that has the minimal absolute difference.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] closestDivisors(int num) {
        int[] res1 = findClosestDivisors(num + 1);
        int[] res2 = findClosestDivisors(num + 2);
        
        if (Math.abs(res1[0] - res1[1]) < Math.abs(res2[0] - res2[1])) {
            return res1;
        } else {
            return res2;
        }
    }
    
    private int[] findClosestDivisors(int target) {
        int sqrt = (int) Math.sqrt(target);
        for (int i = sqrt; i > 0; i--) {
            if (target % i == 0) {
                int j = target / i;
                return new int[] {i, j};
            }
        }
        return new int[] {1, target}; // fallback
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Finding Divisors**: 
  - For each target number (`num+1` and `num+2`), we iterate up to the square root of the number to find divisors, which is `O(√n)`.
  
- **Overall Complexity**: 
  - We perform this operation twice (once for `num+1` and once for `num+2`), so the overall complexity is `O(2√n)`, which simplifies to `O(√n)`.

This solution is efficient and should work well even for larger values of `num`.
