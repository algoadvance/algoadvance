[Leetcode 1413. Minimum Value to Get Positive Step by Step Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1413)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. You start with an initial value `startValue = 0`.

In each step, you are required to add the current element of the array to `startValue`.

Return the minimum positive value of `startValue` such that the step by step sum is always positive.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Input Values**: What are the constraints on the values of `nums` and its length?
   - `nums` can be of length between 1 and 100.
   - Each element in `nums` can be in the range of -100 to 100.

2. **Output**: Should I return the minimum positive integer as the output?
   - Yes, you need to return the smallest positive integer value for `startValue` such that the cumulative sum never drops to zero or below during the iteration through the array.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Initialize `minVal` to a high positive value (e.g., `Integer.MAX_VALUE`) to keep track of the minimum step-by-step sum encountered during the iteration.
2. **Iterate and Track**: Iterate through the array while maintaining a running sum and update `minVal` with the smallest running sum.
3. **Determine Start Value**: The minimum positive `startValue` will be `1 - minVal` if `minVal` is negative or zero. If `minVal` is positive, `startValue` will simply be 1.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minStartValue(int[] nums) {
        int minVal = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int runningSum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            runningSum += num;
            minVal = Math.min(minVal, runningSum);
        }
        
        // If minVal is negative or zero, the minimum start value to get positive sums is 1 - minVal
        // If minVal is positive, the minimum start value is 1
        return minVal < 1 ? 1 - minVal : 1;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {-3, 2, -3, 4, 2};
        System.out.println(sol.minStartValue(nums)); // Output: 5
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. We only make a single pass through the array to compute the running sum and determine the minimum value.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) as the solution only uses a constant amount of additional space.

This strategy ensures that the solution is efficient and meets the problem's constraints.
