[Leetcode 1447. Simplified Fractions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1447)
## Problem Statement:
Given an integer `n`, return a list of all simplified fractions between 0 and 1 (exclusive) such that the denominator is less-than or equal to `n`. The fractions can be in any order.

A fraction `a/b` is simplified if there is no integer `k > 1` such that `a` and `b` are both divisible by `k`.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Inputs:** 
   - What is the range of `n`? 
     - You can assume `n` is between 1 and 100 inclusive.

2. **Outputs:**
   - Should the fractions be returned as strings in the form `"a/b"`?
     - Yes.

3. **Order:**
   - Is there a specific order required for the output list?
     - No, the fractions can be in any order.

## Strategy:
To generate all simplified fractions for a given denominator up to `n`, we need to:
1. Iterate over all possible denominators `b` from 2 to `n`.
2. For each denominator `b`, iterate over all possible numerators `a` from 1 to `b-1`.
3. Check if the fraction `a/b` is in its simplified form:
   - A fraction is simplified if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` is 1.
4. If the fraction is simplified, add it to the result list in the format `"a/b"`.

## Code:
Let's implement the solution in Java:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class SimplifiedFractions {
    public List<String> simplifiedFractions(int n) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int b = 2; b <= n; b++) {
            for (int a = 1; a < b; a++) {
                if (gcd(a, b) == 1) {
                    result.add(a + "/" + b);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    private int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            return a;
        }
        return gcd(b, a % b);
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the solution can be analyzed as follows:

1. **Outer loop** over `b` from 2 to `n`: This takes O(n) time.
2. **Inner loop** over `a` from 1 to `b-1`: On average, this can be approximated by O(n/2) over all iterations.
3. **GCD calculation** for each pair `(a, b)`: This operation runs in O(log(min(a, b))) time, where `log` is the logarithm base 2.

Overall, the time complexity can be considered as:
\[ O(n^2 \log n) \]
Where n is the maximum value of the denominator. 

## Space Complexity:
The additional space used by the program is mainly for storing the result list, which in the worst case can contain approximately O(n^2) elements.

Thus, the space complexity is:
\[ O(n^2) \]
