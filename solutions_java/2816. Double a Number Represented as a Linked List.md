[Leetcode 2816. Double a Number Represented as a Linked List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2816)
## Problem Statement
You are given a non-negative number represented in the form of a singly linked list. Each node contains a single digit and the digits are stored in reverse order. Your task is to write a function that doubles this number represented by the linked list and returns it in the same reverse order format.

For example:
- Input: `1 -> 2 -> 3` (which represents the number 321)
- Output: `2 -> 4 -> 6` (which represents the number 642)

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Can the linked list be empty?
   - Are there any limitations on the size of the number?
   - Is the input guaranteed to be non-negative?

2. **Output Format:**
   - Should we return a new linked list or modify the existing one?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should we do if the result has more digits than the input?
   - How do we handle a carry that results from the doubling?

## Strategy
1. **Traverse the Linked List:** Start from the head and iterate through the linked list.
2. **Double Each Digit:** For each node, double its value and handle the carry-over to the next digit.
3. **Handle Carry-overs:** If doubling a digit results in a number greater than 9, set the current digit to the remainder when divided by 10 and carry over the quotient to the next digit.
4. **Account for Additional Digit:** If there is any carry left after processing the last node, create a new node with the carry value.
5. **Return the Head of the Modified List:** The input list is modified (or a new list is created), and the head node of this list is returned.

## Code
```java
// Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode() {}
    ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
    ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
}

public class Solution {
    public ListNode doubleNumber(ListNode head) {
        // Edge case: if the linked list is empty.
        if (head == null) {
            return null;
        }

        ListNode current = head;
        int carry = 0;

        // Iterate over the linked list, doubling values and managing carry.
        while (current != null) {
            int newValue = current.val * 2 + carry;
            carry = newValue / 10;
            current.val = newValue % 10;
            
            // If there is no next node and carry is not zero, we need to add a new node.
            if (current.next == null && carry != 0) {
                current.next = new ListNode(carry);
                carry = 0; // Reset carry as it has been handled.
            }
            
            current = current.next;
        }
        
        return head;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the linked list. 
  - We traverse each node exactly once to process the doubling and manage carry operations.
  
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\).
  - We only use a constant amount of extra space (e.g., for the `carry` variable). The modification is done in-place on the original linked list.

By following the provided strategy and implementing the code above, we ensure that the linked list is correctly doubled and handle any additional cases like carry-over.
