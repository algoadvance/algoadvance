[Leetcode 2663. Lexicographically Smallest Beautiful String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2663)
### Problem Statement:

You are given a string, `s`, of lowercase English letters and an integer `k`. Your task is to find the lexicographically smallest string that is greater than `s` but still beautiful. A string is considered beautiful if no consecutive characters are the same, and no three consecutive characters form a palindrome.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. What are the constraints on the length of the string `s`?
2. Can you confirm that the string must be strictly greater than the given string `s`?
3. What values can `k` take?

Let's assume the following after getting answers from the interviewer:

1. The length of the string can be up to \(10^5\).
2. Yes, the new string must be strictly greater than `s`.
3. The value of `k` can be any integer from 1 to 26, representing the size of the character set.

### Strategy:

To solve this problem, we need to:

1. **Generate the Next Lexicographical String:**
    - Start from right to left, and find the first character that can be incremented.
    - Increment this character and set all subsequent characters to the smallest lexicographically character (`'a'`).

2. **Validate and Fix the New String to Ensure It's Beautiful:**
    - Iterate through the new string:
        - Ensure there are no consecutive duplicate characters.
        - Ensure no three consecutive characters form a palindrome.

3. **Adjust Characters to Skip Invalid Situations:**
    - If we find an invalid character situation, we need to change characters while ensuring all subsequent characters are as small as possible.

### Code:
```java
public class LexicographicallySmallestBeautifulString {
    public static String makeBeautiful(String s, int k) {
        int n = s.length();
        char[] chars = s.toCharArray();
        int i = n - 1;
        
        // Increment the string to get next lexicographical string
        while (i >= 0 && chars[i] == (char) ('a' + k - 1)) {
            chars[i] = 'a';
            i--;
        }

        if (i < 0) {
            // If we can't increment anymore, return an empty string
            return "";
        }

        // Increment the character
        chars[i] = (char) (chars[i] + 1);

        // Set the rest to 'a'
        for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            chars[j] = 'a';
        }

        // Validate and fix the beautiful string
        boolean valid = false;
        while (!valid) {
            valid = true;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if ((j > 0 && chars[j] == chars[j-1]) || 
                    (j > 1 && chars[j] == chars[j-2])) {
                    valid = false;
                    if (chars[j] == (char) ('a' + k - 1)) {
                        chars[j] = 'a';
                        int l = j - 1;
                        while (l >= 0 && chars[l] == (char) ('a' + k - 1)) {
                            chars[l] = 'a';
                            l--;
                        }
                        if (l >= 0) {
                            chars[l]++;
                        } else {
                            return "";
                        }
                        break;
                    } else {
                        chars[j]++;
                    }
                    for (int m = j + 1; m < n; m++) {
                        chars[m] = 'a';
                    }
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        return new String(chars);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(makeBeautiful("abcz", 3)); // Sample test
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- Generating the next lexicographical string takes \(O(n)\) since we only move from the end of the string to the first modifiable character.
- Validating and potentially adjusting the beautiful string also effectively takes \(O(n)\) in the worst case because every character might need to be inspected and changed.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\).

Given the problem constraints, this approach should be efficient and suitable for the input limits.
