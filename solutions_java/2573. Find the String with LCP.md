[Leetcode 2573. Find the String with LCP](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2573)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of strings `words`. You need to find the string that, when removed, leaves the longest common prefix (LCP) unchanged. The prefix should be as long as possible after removing one string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What should we return if multiple strings can be removed to achieve the same effect?
   - You can return any one of them.
2. What should we return if removing any string changes the LCP?
   - In that case, return an empty string or an indication that no such string exists.
3. What would be the input size and constraints?
   - The length of `words` can be up to `10^5`.
   - Each word's length can be up to `100`.

### Strategy
1. **Calculate the LCP**: First, determine the longest common prefix of the entire array of strings.
2. **Simulate Removals**: Attempt to remove each string individually and recalculate the LCP for the remaining strings.
3. **Compare LCPs**: Compare these LCPs to check if there's any string whose removal results in the original LCP.
4. **Optimization**: Use binary search to find the longest common prefix among strings for faster computation.

### Code

```java
public class FindStringWithLCPOut {
    
    public static String findStringToRemove(String[] words) {
        String longestCommonPrefix = findLCP(words);
        
        for (String word : words) {
            String[] remainingWords = new String[words.length - 1];
            int index = 0;
            for (String w : words) {
                if (!w.equals(word)) {
                    remainingWords[index++] = w;
                }
            }
            if (findLCP(remainingWords).equals(longestCommonPrefix)) {
                return word;
            }
        }
        
        // If no such string is found, return an empty string or indication
        return "";
    }
    
    private static String findLCP(String[] words) {
        if (words == null || words.length == 0) return "";
        String prefix = words[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < words.length; i++) {
            while (words[i].indexOf(prefix) != 0) {
                prefix = prefix.substring(0, prefix.length() - 1);
                if (prefix.isEmpty()) return "";
            }
        }
        return prefix;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] words = {"flower", "flow", "flight"};
        System.out.println(findStringToRemove(words)); // Example output; "flower", "flow" or "flight"
        
        words = new String[]{"flower", "flow", "flight", "fluent"};
        System.out.println(findStringToRemove(words)); // Expected output
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Finding LCP for the complete array**: 
    - O(N * M), where N is the number of words and M is the average length of the words.
2. **Simulating Removals**:
    - For each word (N times), finding the LCP for the remaining words takes O((N-1) * M).
    - This results in an overall complexity of O(N^2 * M).

By implementing this according to the strategy above, we aim to efficiently determine which string's removal keeps the LCP unchanged. If any clarification is needed, let me know!
