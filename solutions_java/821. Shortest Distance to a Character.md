[Leetcode 821. Shortest Distance to a Character](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l821)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and a character `c` that occurs in `s`, return an array of integers representing the shortest distance from the character `c` in the string `s`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can characters in `s` be uppercase or lowercase?**
   - Typically yes, string `s` can have any characters including uppercase and lowercase letters.
   
2. **Can the character `c` be an uppercase or lowercase letter?**
   - Yes, `c` can be any character including uppercase and lowercase letters.
   
3. **What kind of constraints should we consider (e.g., length of `s`)?**
   - Usually, constraints are mentioned in the problem statement. Let's assume the string length can be up to 10^4 for this explanation.
   
4. **Are there any edge cases we should consider?**
   - Yes, cases where `s` is very short, where `c` is the first or the last character, or where `c` appears consecutively in `s`.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize an array** to store the shortest distances. Set it to a large value (like `Integer.MAX_VALUE`) initially.
2. **First pass (left to right)**: Keep track of the most recent position of `c` and update the shortest distance using this position.
3. **Second pass (right to left)**: Similarly, keep track of the most recent position of `c` and update the shortest distances from this run through.
4. This ensures that every element in the array is the minimum distance to the nearest `c`.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] shortestToChar(String s, char c) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[] result = new int[n];
        
        // Initialize all distances to a large number
        int inf = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        // Left to right pass
        int position = -inf;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == c) {
                position = i;
            }
            result[i] = i - position;
        }
        
        // Right to left pass
        position = inf;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == c) {
                position = i;
            }
            result[i] = Math.min(result[i], position - i);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **First pass**: O(n)
  - Iterates through the string once from left to right.
- **Second pass**: O(n)
  - Iterates through the string once from right to left.
- **Overall**: O(n)
  - The solution processes the string twice linearly.

This approach ensures an efficient solution to the problem while maintaining clarity and simplicity.
