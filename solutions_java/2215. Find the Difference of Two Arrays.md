[Leetcode 2215. Find the Difference of Two Arrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2215)
## Problem Statement

Given two **0-indexed** integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return a list `answer` of size `2` where:

1. `answer[0]` is a list of all distinct integers in `nums1` which are not present in `nums2`.
2. `answer[1]` is a list of all distinct integers in `nums2` which are not present in `nums1`.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3], nums2 = [2,4,6]
Output: [[1,3],[4,6]]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the integers in the arrays be negative? 
   - Yes.

2. Can the arrays contain duplicate numbers?
   - Yes, but we are only interested in distinct integers.

3. What should be the order of elements in the output lists?
   - The order of elements in the output lists does not matter.

4. Can the arrays be empty?
   - Yes, the arrays can be empty.

## Strategy

1. **Use Sets for Distinct Elements:** Convert `nums1` and `nums2` to sets, called `set1` and `set2`, to automatically handle distinct integers.
2. **Difference Calculation:**
   - For `answer[0]`: find elements in `set1` that are not in `set2`.
   - For `answer[1]`: find elements in `set2` that are not in `set1`.

3. **Convert to Lists:** The problem requires the final result to be in the form of lists of integers.

## Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Set;

public class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> findDifference(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        // Convert arrays to sets to handle distinct elements
        Set<Integer> set1 = new HashSet<>();
        Set<Integer> set2 = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (int num : nums1) {
            set1.add(num);
        }
        
        for (int num : nums2) {
            set2.add(num);
        }
        
        // Find elements in set1 not in set2
        List<Integer> list1 = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int num : set1) {
            if (!set2.contains(num)) {
                list1.add(num);
            }
        }
        
        // Find elements in set2 not in set1
        List<Integer> list2 = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int num : set2) {
            if (!set1.contains(num)) {
                list2.add(num);
            }
        }
        
        // Prepare the answer
        List<List<Integer>> answer = new ArrayList<>();
        answer.add(list1);
        answer.add(list2);
        
        return answer;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Conversion to Sets** (`O(n)` and `O(m)` where `n` is the length of `nums1` and `m` is the length of `nums2`): Each integer from the arrays is added to a set.
- **Difference Calculation** (`O(n + m)`): Each set element is checked against the other set.

Overall, the time complexity is O(n + m), where n and m are the lengths of the input arrays.
