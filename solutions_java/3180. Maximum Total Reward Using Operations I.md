[Leetcode 3180. Maximum Total Reward Using Operations I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3180)
## Problem Statement
Given an initial reward of 0, apply a list of operations to maximize the total reward. Each operation is described by two integers: `x` (add the specified amount to the reward) and `y` (multiply the reward by the specified amount). You can apply the operations in any order to maximize the total reward.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are `x` and `y` guaranteed to be positive integers?
2. Is there any limit to the number of operations or the size of the integers?
3. Can the same operation be applied multiple times?
4. Can the reward values become negative?

## Strategy
1. **Sorting Approach**:
   - Since multiplication has a compounding effect, we will first apply operations that multiply by higher values.
   - After the multiplications, we will apply the additions.
   - This approach ensures that when we apply the additions, the multiplying effect has already maximized the reward.

2. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Separate operations into two lists: one for additions and one for multiplications.
   - Sort the multiplication operations in descending order of `y`.
   - Sort the addition operations in descending order of `x`.
   - Apply all multiplication operations followed by addition operations.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle cases where there are no multiplicative operations.
   - Handle cases where the operations list is empty.

## Time Complexity
- Sorting the operations: O(n log n)
- Applying operations: O(n)
- Total: O(n log n)

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MaxTotalReward {
    public static int maxTotalReward(List<int[]> operations) {
        List<int[]> additions = new ArrayList<>();
        List<int[]> multiplications = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Separate operations
        for (int[] op : operations) {
            if (op[1] > 0) {
                multiplications.add(op);
            } else {
                additions.add(op);
            }
        }
        
        // Sort both lists
        multiplications.sort((a, b) -> Integer.compare(b[1], a[1])); // Descending order of y
        additions.sort((a, b) -> Integer.compare(b[0], a[0])); // Descending order of x
        
        int reward = 0;
        
        // Apply multiplication operations
        for (int[] op : multiplications) {
            reward *= op[1];
        }
        
        // Apply addition operations
        for (int[] op : additions) {
            reward += op[0];
        }
        
        return reward;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<int[]> operations = Arrays.asList(
            new int[]{3, 0},
            new int[]{2, 0},
            new int[]{0, 5},
            new int[]{0, 3}
        );
        
        System.out.println(maxTotalReward(operations)); // Should print the maximum reward possible
    }
}
```

## Explanation
- **Operation Separation**: We segregate the operations based on whether they are additions or multiplications.
- **Sorting**: We sort multiplication operations in descending order and addition operations similarly to maximize the effect.
- **Application**: We first apply the multiplications to maximize the intermediate value and then the additions.

This approach ensures the maximum reward is achieved by leveraging the multiplicative compound interest-like effect followed by simple addition.
