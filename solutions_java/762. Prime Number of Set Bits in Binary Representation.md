[Leetcode 762. Prime Number of Set Bits in Binary Representation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l762)
## Problem Statement
Given two integers `left` and `right`, return the count of numbers in the inclusive range `[left, right]` having a prime number of set bits in their binary representation.

Here's a quick recap of the steps:
1. Convert each number in the range to its binary representation.
2. Count the number of set bits (1s) in this representation.
3. Determine if this count is a prime number.
4. Return the total count of such numbers.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of `left` and `right`? Can they be negative, or are they always positive?
     - Both `left` and `right` will be between `1` and `10^6`, inclusive.
   
2. **Prime Definition:**
   - Should we consider `1` as a prime number?
     - No, in standard mathematical definitions, `1` is not considered a prime number.

3. **Output:**
   - The function should return a single integer representing the count of numbers with a prime number of set bits.

## Strategy
1. **Precompute Primes:**
   - Since counts of set bits for numbers within the given range will not be very high, we can precompute which numbers from `0 to 20` (highest count of set bits within the range 1 to 10^6) are prime.
   
2. **Count Set Bits:**
   - For each number in the range ([left, right]), convert the number to its binary representation and count the number of `1s`.
   
3. **Checking Prime Set Bits:**
   - Use the precomputed primes to check if the number of set bits is prime.

4. **Code the Solution:**
   - Iterate through the range and apply the above checks.

## Code

Here's the implementation in Java:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class Solution {
    private static final Set<Integer> primes = new HashSet<>();

    static {
        primes.add(2);
        primes.add(3);
        primes.add(5);
        primes.add(7);
        primes.add(11);
        primes.add(13);
        primes.add(17);
        primes.add(19);
    }

    private int countSetBits(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            count += (n & 1);
            n >>= 1;
        }
        return count;
    }

    public int countPrimeSetBits(int left, int right) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = left; i <= right; i++) {
            if (primes.contains(countSetBits(i))) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        // Example test case
        System.out.println(sol.countPrimeSetBits(6, 10)); // Output: 4
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Precomputation:**
   - Creating the set of prime numbers up to 20 is O(1) since the size of the set is constant and small.

2. **Main Loop over Range `[left, right]`:**
   - Looping from `left` to `right` is O(n), where `n` is (right - left + 1).
   
3. **Counting Set Bits for Each Number:**
   - Counting set bits for each number can be done in O(log(m)), where `m` is the maximum possible value within the range, which is 10^6. Converting and counting bits involves iterating over the bits, resulting in O(log(m)).
   
Combining these, the overall time complexity is O(n * log(m)), which simplifies to O(n * log(n)) for this specific problem with constraints, where `n` is (right - left + 1) and `m` is 10^6. This is efficient enough for the given problem constraints.
