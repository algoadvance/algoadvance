[Leetcode 1658. Minimum Operations to Reduce X to Zero](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1658)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `x`. In one operation, you can either remove the leftmost or the rightmost element from the array `nums` and subtract its value from `x`. Note that this modifies the array for future operations.

Return the **minimum number of operations** to reduce `x` to exactly 0 if it's possible, otherwise, return -1.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,1,4,2,3], x = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: The optimal solution is to remove the last 2 elements to reduce x to zero.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [5,6,7,8,9], x = 4
Output: -1
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [3,2,20,1,1,3], x = 10
Output: 5
Explanation: The optimal solution is to remove the last 3 elements and the first 2 elements to reduce x to zero.
```
 
### Clarifying Questions
1. Does the array contain only positive integers?
2. Is it possible for x to be zero initially? (This would imply no operations are needed)
3. Can the array be empty?

### Strategy
The problem can be transformed into finding the longest subarray whose sum is equal to the total sum of `nums` minus `x`. This is because removing elements from the start or end to achieve `x` is equivalent to keeping a middle subarray that totals `sum(nums) - x`.

Steps:
1. Compute the target sum we need for the subarray, which is `total_sum - x`.
2. Use a sliding window (two-pointer technique) to find the longest subarray with this sum.
3. Subtract the length of this subarray from the total length of the array to get the minimum operations.
4. If no subarray is found, return -1.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums, int x) {
        int total = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            total += num;
        }

        // The target sum we need to find in the subarray
        int target = total - x;
        if (target < 0) {
            return -1;
        }
        if (target == 0) {
            return nums.length;
        }

        int maxLength = -1;
        int currentSum = 0;
        int left = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
            currentSum += nums[right];

            while (currentSum > target && left <= right) {
                currentSum -= nums[left++];
            }

            if (currentSum == target) {
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
            }
        }

        return maxLength == -1 ? -1 : nums.length - maxLength;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array `nums`, since we pass through the array at most twice with the two-pointer technique.
- The space complexity is O(1) because we only use a few extra variables.

This concise and efficient approach ensures that the solution is optimal for large arrays as well.
