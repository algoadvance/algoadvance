[Leetcode 639. Decode Ways II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l639)
### Problem Statement
A message containing letters from A-Z can be encoded into numbers using the following mapping:

```
'A' -> "1"
'B' -> "2"
...
'Z' -> "26"
```

To decode an encoded message, all the digits must be grouped then mapped back to letters using the reverse of the mapping above (there may be multiple ways). For example, "11106" can be mapped into:
- "AAJF" with the grouping (1 1 10 6)
- "KJF" with the grouping (11 10 6)

Notice that "06" cannot be mapped into 'F' because "6" is different from '06'.

In addition to the regular encoding, any '*' character can represent any digit from '1' to '9' and any two consecutive '*' characters can represent any two-digit number from "10" to "26", inclusive.

Given the encoded message containing digits and the character '*', return the total number of ways to decode it. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Example
```
Input: "*"
Output: 9
```

```
Input: "1*"
Output: 18
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the length limit of the input string?
   - The length of the string can be up to 100,000.

2. Are there any characters other than digits and '*' in the input string?
   - No, the message contains only digits and '*' characters.

3. Should we consider leading zeroes as invalid sequences?
   - Yes, any sequence with leading zeroes that cannot form valid mappings should be considered invalid.

### Strategy
1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: We will use dynamic programming to solve this problem. Let's maintain an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to decode the substring `s[0..i-1]`.
2. **Initialization**: 
   - If the first character is '*', it can represent any digit 1-9 (9 options).
   - If the first character is a digit (not '0'), there's only one way to decode it.
3. **Transition**:
   - For a single digit decode: `dp[i]` could consider `dp[i-1]` if the current character is a valid single character.
   - For two-digit decode: `dp[i]` could consider `dp[i-2]` if the combination of current and previous character form a valid two-digit number.
4. **Compute modulo**: Since the answer can be large, we'll take modulo `10^9 + 7` at each step.

### Code
```java
public class DecodeWaysII {
    public int numDecodings(String s) {
        int MOD = 1000000007;
        int n = s.length();
        long[] dp = new long[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 1; // Base case: There's one way to decode an empty string.
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            char current = s.charAt(i - 1);
            
            // Single character decoding
            if (current == '*') {
                dp[i] = dp[i - 1] * 9; // Each '*' can represent any digit from 1 to 9.
            } else if (current >= '1' && current <= '9') {
                dp[i] = dp[i - 1]; // Current single digit is a valid character
            }
            
            // Two characters decoding
            if (i > 1) {
                char previous = s.charAt(i - 2);
                if (previous == '*') {
                    if (current == '*') {
                        dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - 2] * 15) % MOD; // "**" can be 11-19, 21-26
                    } else if (current >= '0' && current <= '6') {
                        dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - 2] * 2) % MOD; // "*1-*6" can be 11-16 or 21-26
                    } else {
                        dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - 2]) % MOD; // "*7-*9" can only be 17-19
                    }
                } else if (previous == '1') {
                    if (current == '*') {
                        dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - 2] * 9) % MOD; // "1*" can be 11-19
                    } else {
                        dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - 2]) % MOD; // "1x" where x is 0-9
                    }
                } else if (previous == '2') {
                    if (current == '*') {
                        dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - 2] * 6) % MOD; // "2*" can be 21-26
                    } else if (current >= '0' && current <= '6') {
                        dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[i - 2]) % MOD; // "2x" where x is 0-6
                    }
                }
            }
            dp[i] %= MOD;
        }
        
        return (int) dp[n];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The algorithm processes each character in the string exactly once.
- Thus, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is O(n) due to the dynamic programming table `dp`.

This solution is efficient and should handle large input sizes up to 100,000 characters.
