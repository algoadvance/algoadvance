[Leetcode 915. Partition Array into Disjoint Intervals](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l915)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. You need to partition the array into two contiguous subarrays left and right so that:

1. Every element in the left subarray is less than or equal to every element in the right subarray.
2. Both left and right are non-empty.
3. Left subarray has the smallest possible size.

Return the length of the left subarray after partitioning it such that the above conditions are met.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What will the input array `nums` look like?**
   - The input `nums` will be a list of integers.

2. **Are there any constraints on the size or the values of `nums`?**
   - `2 <= nums.length <= 30000`
   - `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`

3. **What should be returned?**
   - The length of the left subarray.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the following approach:

1. Iterate through the array from left to right, keeping track of the maximum value in the left subarray (`max_left`).
2. Create an auxiliary array `min_right` where `min_right[i]` stores the minimum value from index `i` to the end.
3. Initialize `min_right` by iterating from right to left.
4. Iterate through `nums`, comparing the current `max_left` with `min_right[i + 1]`. This helps determine the smallest index at which the partition can be made.
5. Return the index + 1 where the partitioning condition is satisfied.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int partitionDisjoint(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] minRight = new int[n];

        // Fill minRight array
        minRight[n - 1] = nums[n - 1];
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            minRight[i] = Math.min(minRight[i + 1], nums[i]);
        }

        // Track the maximum value in the left partition
        int maxLeft = nums[0];
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            maxLeft = Math.max(maxLeft, nums[i]);
            if (maxLeft <= minRight[i + 1]) {
                return i + 1;
            }
        }

        return n; // This should not be reached as there is always a valid partition
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because we are iterating through the array twice (once to fill `minRight` and once to find the partition point).
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` due to the auxiliary array `minRight`.

This approach ensures an efficient solution that meets the required constraints.
