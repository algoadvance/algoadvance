[Leetcode 2399. Check Distances Between Same Letters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2399)
## Problem Statement

Given a 0-indexed string `s` consisting of only lowercase English letters, you need to determine whether the distances between the same letters in `s` are consistent with the provided distances array.

In detail, for each `s[i]` and `s[j]` with `s[i] == s[j]` and `i < j`, the distance between `i` and `j` should equal `distances[s[i]-'a']`. Here, `distances` is an array of length 26 where distances[i] contains the desired distance between the occurrences of the character `('a' + i)` if such a character is in the string.

Return `true` if the distances match for all matching characters, otherwise, return `false`.

### Example
**Example 1:**
```java
Input: s = "abaccb", distances = [1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
Output: true
Explanation: The letter 'a' occurs at indices 0 and 2, and the distance between them is 2 - 0 - 1 = 1. The letter 'b' occurs at indices 1 and 5, and the distance between them is 5 - 1 - 1 = 3.
- For 'c' there is only one occurrence at index 2 and 3, so we do not need to check anything for 'c'.
Thus, the output is true.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can `s` be empty?
   - No, assume `s` will have at least one character as it will always have valid input.

2. Can `distances` have any invalid values or will it always contain 26 non-negative integers?
   - `distances` will always have 26 non-negative integers.

## Strategy

1. Create an array `lastIndex` initialized to `-1` of size 26 to hold the last seen index of each character.
2. Iterate through the string, for each character `c` at index `i`:
   - Calculate its position `pos = c - 'a'`.
   - If `lastIndex[pos]` is not `-1`, then check if the distance between current index `i` and `lastIndex[pos]` is equal to `distances[pos] + 1`. If not, return false.
   - Update `lastIndex[pos]` with the current index `i`.

If all checks pass, return `true`.

## Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean checkDistances(String s, int[] distances) {
        int[] lastIndex = new int[26];
        Arrays.fill(lastIndex, -1);

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            int pos = s.charAt(i) - 'a';

            if (lastIndex[pos] != -1) {
                if ((i - lastIndex[pos] - 1) != distances[pos]) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
            lastIndex[pos] = i;
        }

        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        
        String s1 = "abaccb";
        int[] distances1 = {1, 3, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0};
        System.out.println(sol.checkDistances(s1, distances1)); // Output: true
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s` since we are iterating through the string only once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) because the `lastIndex` array has a fixed size of 26, which does not depend on the size of the input.

This method ensures that we efficiently check each character and its distances in one pass through the string.
