[Leetcode 3153. Sum of Digit Differences of All Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3153)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums`, calculate the sum of absolute differences of the digits of all possible pairs of two distinct integers in the array.

For example:
Input: `nums = [12, 23, 34]`
Output: `13`
Explanation:
- The pairs are (12, 23), (12, 34), (23, 34)
- For pair (12, 23), the sum of absolute digit differences is `|1-2| + |2-3| = 1 + 1 = 2`
- For pair (12, 34), the sum of absolute digit differences is `|1-3| + |2-4| = 2 + 2 = 4`
- For pair (23, 34), the sum of absolute digit differences is `|2-3| + |3-4| = 1 + 1 = 2`
- Total sum is `2 + 4 + 2 = 8`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the integers guaranteed to be positive? (Assumed positive for simplicity)
2. What is the maximum array length? (This will help determine feasibility and complexity)
3. Can we ignore arrays with identical elements since absolute differences will be zero? (Assuming all elements are distinct)

## Strategy

1. Iterate through all possible pairs of integers in the array.
2. For each pair, convert the numbers to their individual digits.
3. Compute the sum of absolute differences of corresponding digits for each pair.
4. Accumulate this sum and return the total.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class SumOfDigitDifferences {
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {12, 23, 34};
        System.out.println(sumOfDigitDifferences(nums));
    }
    
    public static int sumOfDigitDifferences(int[] nums) {
        int totalSum = 0;
        int n = nums.length;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                totalSum += digitDifferenceSum(nums[i], nums[j]);
            }
        }
        
        return totalSum;
    }
    
    private static int digitDifferenceSum(int num1, int num2) {
        int diffSum = 0;
        while (num1 > 0 || num2 > 0) {
            int digit1 = num1 % 10;
            int digit2 = num2 % 10;
            
            diffSum += Math.abs(digit1 - digit2);
            
            num1 /= 10;
            num2 /= 10;
        }
        return diffSum;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The outer loop runs in \( O(n^2) \) where `n` is the number of elements in the array, covering all pairs of integers.
- The digit comparison within the `digitDifferenceSum` method runs in \( O(d) \) where `d` is the number of digits in the largest number. For simplicity, assume `d` is a constant as the maximum number of digits in practical cases is fixed (like 32-bit integer).
- Overall, the time complexity is \( O(n^2) \).

This algorithm should work efficiently for reasonably sized arrays (e.g., `n` up to hundreds).
