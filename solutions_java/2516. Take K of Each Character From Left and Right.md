[Leetcode 2516. Take K of Each Character From Left and Right](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2516)
## Problem Statement
LeetCode Problem 2516: Given a string `s` and integers `k` and `n`, your task is to determine the minimum length of a contiguous substring containing exactly `k` occurrences of each character in `n` distinct characters from `s`. If it is not possible, return `-1`.

### Example
1. Input: `s = "aaabbbccc"`, `k = 2`, `n = 2`
   Output: `4`
2. Input: `s = "aabbcc"`, `k = 3`, `n = 2`
   Output: `-1`

## Clarifying Questions
1. What characters does the input string `s` contain? (Assumption: lowercase English letters)
2. Should the solution account for characters other than the first `n` distinct characters in `s`?
3. What should be returned if it is not possible to find such a substring? (Return `-1`)
4. Can `k` be greater than the number of times any character appears in `s`?
5. Is `n` guaranteed to be less than or equal to the number of distinct characters in `s`?

## Strategy
1. **Initial Checks**:
   - If `n` is greater than the number of distinct characters in `s`, return `-1` immediately.
   - If `k` is greater than the maximum count of any character in `s`, return `-1` immediately.

2. **Sliding Window Approach**:
   - Use a sliding window to find the smallest substring that satisfies the conditions.
   - Maintain a hashmap to count the occurrences of each character in the current window.
   - Expand the window by moving the right pointer.
   - Once the window contains exactly `k` occurrences of `n` distinct characters, try to shrink the window from the left to get the minimum length.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int minLengthSubstring(String s, int k, int n) {
        Map<Character, Integer> charCount = new HashMap<>();
        Set<Character> uniqueChars = new HashSet<>();
        
        // Count occurrences of each character
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            charCount.put(c, charCount.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
            uniqueChars.add(c);
        }

        // Early termination checks
        if (uniqueChars.size() < n) return -1;
        if (charCount.values().stream().anyMatch(count -> count < k)) return -1;

        int minLength = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        Map<Character, Integer> windowCount = new HashMap<>();
        int left = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < s.length(); right++) {
            char cRight = s.charAt(right);
            windowCount.put(cRight, windowCount.getOrDefault(cRight, 0) + 1);

            while (isValid(windowCount, k, n)) {
                minLength = Math.min(minLength, right - left + 1);
                char cLeft = s.charAt(left);
                windowCount.put(cLeft, windowCount.get(cLeft) - 1);
                if (windowCount.get(cLeft) == 0) {
                    windowCount.remove(cLeft);
                }
                left++;
            }
        }

        return minLength == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : minLength;
    }

    private boolean isValid(Map<Character, Integer> windowCount, int k, int n) {
        int validCharacters = 0;
        for (int count : windowCount.values()) {
            if (count >= k) {
                validCharacters++;
            }
        }
        return validCharacters >= n;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.minLengthSubstring("aaabbbccc", 2, 2)); // Output: 4
        System.out.println(sol.minLengthSubstring("aabbcc", 3, 2));    // Output: -1
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Preprocessing:** `O(|s|)` where `|s|` is the length of the string `s` (to count characters).
- **Sliding Window:** `O(|s|)` for processing each character once with sliding window mechanism.
- **Total:** `O(|s|)` for linear pass through the string.

The overall time complexity of the solution is `O(|s|)`.
