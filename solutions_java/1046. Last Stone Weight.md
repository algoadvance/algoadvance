[Leetcode 1046. Last Stone Weight](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1046)
### Problem Statement

We are given a list of stones' weights. Each turn, we choose the **two heaviest** stones and smash them together. Suppose the stones have weights `x` and `y` with `x <= y`. The result of this smash is:

- If `x == y`, both stones are destroyed.
- If `x != y`, the stone of weight `x` is destroyed, and the stone of weight `y` has a new weight `y - x`.

At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left. Return the weight of this stone (or 0 if there are no stones left.)

### Example

- Input: `[2,7,4,1,8,1]`
- Output: `1` 

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What's the expected input size?**
   - The number of stones `n` could be up to 30.
   
2. **Can the weight of stones be negative or zero?**
   - No, stone weights are positive integers.
   
3. **What should be the return value if the input list is empty?**
   - If there are no stones to begin with, the return value should be 0.

### Strategy

1. **Utilize a Max Heap**: 
   - Use a priority queue (max heap) to facilitate extraction of the two heaviest stones efficiently.
   
2. **Algorithm**:
   - Insert all stone weights into the max-heap.
   - While there is more than one stone left in the heap:
     - Extract the two heaviest stones.
     - If they are of equal weight, discard both.
     - If they are not of equal weight, insert the difference back into the heap.
   - At the end of the process, if the heap is empty, return 0. Otherwise, return the weight of the remaining stone.

3. **Java Implementation**: 
   - Use `PriorityQueue` with Collections.reverseOrder to simulate max-heap.

### Code

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;
import java.util.Collections;

public class LastStoneWeight {
    public int lastStoneWeight(int[] stones) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());

        // Add all stones to the max heap
        for (int stone : stones) {
            maxHeap.add(stone);
        }

        // Process the stones
        while (maxHeap.size() > 1) {
            int first = maxHeap.poll();
            int second = maxHeap.poll();

            if (first != second) {
                maxHeap.add(first - second);
            }
        }

        return maxHeap.isEmpty() ? 0 : maxHeap.poll();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LastStoneWeight solution = new LastStoneWeight();
        int[] stones = {2, 7, 4, 1, 8, 1};
        System.out.println(solution.lastStoneWeight(stones));  // Output: 1
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Building the max heap takes O(n log n) time where `n` is the number of stones.
- Each pairing and reinsertion operation has a time complexity of O(log n).
- In the worst case, we have to perform `n-1` such operations.

Overall, the time complexity is approximately O(n log n).
