[Leetcode 699. Falling Squares](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l699)
## Problem Statement

This is a problem from LeetCode called "699. Falling Squares." Here is the problem statement:

On an infinite number line (x-axis), we drop given squares in the order they are given.

The squares are specified by a list `positions`, where `positions[i] = [left, side_length]` represents a square with a side length of `side_length` that drops with its left edge aligned with `x = left`.

Each square falls vertically until it either lands on the top side of another square or touches the ground.

Return a list `ans` where `ans[i]` represents the height of the highest square stack after the `i-th` square is dropped.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format:** Are there any constraints on the value of coordinates or sizes provided in positions?
   - Assume positions is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two integers, and length satisfies `1 <= side_length <= 10^8` and `1 <= left <= 10^8`.
   
2. **Output Type:** Should the output be the maximum height list of integers?

Proceeding with the problem statement and assuming no further specific edge cases or scenarios need clarification.

## Strategy

1. **Data Structure:** Use an array or list to keep track of the heights at each significant point on the x-axis where each square starts and ends.
2. **Height Calculation:** For each new square, determine the range from `left` to `left + side_length - 1`. Check existing heights in this range to find the maximum height. Place the new square on top of this maximum height.
3. **Update Heights:** Update the range from `left` to `left + side_length - 1` to the new height.
4. **Update Result:** Track the highest square seen so far and append it to the result list.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class FallingSquares {
    
    public List<Integer> fallingSquares(int[][] positions) {
        List<int[]> heights = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int currentMax = 0;
        
        for (int[] pos : positions) {
            int left = pos[0], size = pos[1];
            int right = left + size;
            int baseHeight = 0;

            for (int[] h : heights) {
                int start = h[0], end = h[1], height = h[2];
                if (start < right && end > left) {
                    baseHeight = Math.max(baseHeight, height);
                }
            }

            int newHeight = baseHeight + size;
            heights.add(new int[] {left, right, newHeight});
            currentMax = Math.max(currentMax, newHeight);
            result.add(currentMax);
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FallingSquares solution = new FallingSquares();
        int[][] positions = {{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {6, 1}};
        System.out.println(solution.fallingSquares(positions));  // Output: [2, 5, 5]
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Insertion Time:** Each new square insertion could potentially be checked against all previously existing squares to determine the best height to place it at. If there are `n` squares, this gives us `O(n^2)` for the height calculation.
- **Height Update Time:** The update process involves going through previous heights to find the highest stack which again takes `O(n)`.
- **Overall Complexity:** Thus, the total time complexity is `O(n^2)`.

Note: This solution can be optimized using advanced data structures like segment trees or balanced binary search trees to improve efficiency, especially for large inputs.
