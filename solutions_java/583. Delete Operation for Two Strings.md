[Leetcode 583. Delete Operation for Two Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l583)
### Problem Statement

You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. Your task is to return the minimum number of steps required to make `word1` and `word2` the same. In one step, you can delete exactly one character in either string.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: word1 = "sea", word2 = "eat"
Output: 2
Explanation: You need one step to make "sea" to "ea" and another step to make "eat" to "ea".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: word1 = "leetcode", word2 = "etco"
Output: 4
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the strings contain any characters other than lowercase English letters?**
   - No, you can assume that the strings only contain lowercase English letters.

2. **What is the length range of `word1` and `word2`?**
   - Both `word1` and `word2` have lengths that range from `1` to `500`.

3. **Do we need to consider cases where input strings might be empty?**
   - Yes, but the constraints ensure that the strings length from `1` to `500`, so an empty string won't be a part of typical test cases.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use Dynamic Programming to find the longest common subsequence (LCS) of `word1` and `word2`. The idea is to find the longest sequence that appears in both strings without reordering characters. Once we have the length of this sequence, we can determine the minimum deletions needed to make the strings equal by calculating:

\[ \text{deletions} = (\text{length of } word1 - \text{LCS}) + (\text{length of } word2 - \text{LCS}) \]

This is because any character that is not part of the LCS must be deleted.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        int m = word1.length();
        int n = word2.length();

        // Create a DP table to store lengths of longest common subsequence.
        int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];

        // Build the dp table
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                if (word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        // Length of longest common subsequence
        int lcsLength = dp[m][n];

        // The answer is the total number of characters minus twice the lcsLength.
        return (m - lcsLength) + (n - lcsLength);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity of this approach is \(O(m \cdot n)\), where \(m\) is the length of `word1` and \(n\) is the length of `word2`. This is because we use nested loops to fill in the DP table with dimensions \( (m+1) \times (n+1) \).

- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is \( O(m \cdot n) \) as we are using a 2D array of size \( (m+1) \times (n+1) \) to store the DP values.
