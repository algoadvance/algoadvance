[Leetcode 3013. Divide an Array Into Subarrays With Minimum Cost II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3013)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `k`. The objective is to divide the array into intervals such that the sum of the absolute differences between every pair of elements within each interval is minimized along with an additional cost `k` for every subarray created. You need to return the minimal cost.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on `n` and `k`**:
   - What is the range of `n`? Are we dealing with potentially large arrays?
   - Any constraints on the values of `nums`?
2. **Examples for better understanding**:
   - Could you provide a couple of example inputs and outputs?
   
If these questions are clarified satisfactorily, we can then proceed to the solution.

### Code Strategy

To tackle this problem, we can use dynamic programming (DP). Here is a structured plan:

1. **State Definition**:
   - `dp[i]` will represent the minimum cost to partition the first `i` elements of `nums`.
   
2. **Base Case**:
   - `dp[0] = 0`: No cost when there are no elements.
   
3. **Transition**:
   - To calculate `dp[i]`, iterate through all possible previous indices `j` and calculate the cost to partition `nums[j:i]` and add the minimal costs calculated up to `j-1`.

4. **Cost Calculation**:
   - For a range `[j, i]`, the cost of forming this subarray includes the sum of absolute differences plus the cost `k` for creating one subarray.

5. **Final Answer**:
   - The minimal cost for partitioning the entire array `nums` would be `dp[n]`.

### Code

Below is the Java code implementing the above strategy:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MinPartitionCost {

    public int minCost(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        Arrays.fill(dp, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        dp[0] = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = i; j >= 1; j--) {
                int cost = k + costOfSubarray(Arrays.copyOfRange(nums, j - 1, i));
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[j - 1] + cost);
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }

    private int costOfSubarray(int[] subarray) {
        int cost = 0;
        int length = subarray.length;
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < length; j++) {
                cost += Math.abs(subarray[i] - subarray[j]);
            }
        }
        return cost;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinPartitionCost solution = new MinPartitionCost();
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 1, 5, 0, 6};
        int k = 2;
        System.out.println(solution.minCost(nums, k)); // Output depends on correct implementation
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Calculating `costOfSubarray` takes O(m^2), where m is the length of the subarray.
- Outer loop iterates `n` times.
- Inner loop iterates `n` times (worst-case).

This results in a worst-case time complexity of O(n^3), which might require optimization given large inputs. A more efficient way of calculating costs dynamically is required for larger `n`.

### Conclusion

While this solution is conceptually correct, further optimization would be beneficial, especially for efficiently calculating subarray costs. Techniques like prefix sums or segment trees could help optimize the absolute differences calculation.
