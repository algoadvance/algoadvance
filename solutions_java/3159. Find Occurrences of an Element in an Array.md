[Leetcode 3159. Find Occurrences of an Element in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3159)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, write a function to count the number of occurrences of `target` in the array.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,2,2,5], target = 2
Output: 3
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,1,1], target = 1
Output: 5
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3], target = 4
Output: 0
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if the `target` does not exist in the array?**
   - Return `0` if the `target` is not found in `nums`.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the size of the array `nums`?**
   - Assume the length of `nums` is between 0 and 10^4 inclusive.
   
3. **Can `nums` contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, `nums` can contain negative numbers.

4. **What is the expected time complexity for the solution?**
   - A linear time complexity O(n) solution is acceptable since we need to examine each element of the array.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, a straightforward linear scan of the array is sufficient. We will:
1. Initialize a counter to `0`.
2. Iterate through each element in the array.
3. For each element, check if it matches the `target`.
4. If it matches, increment the counter.
5. Return the final count after scanning the array.

### Code

```java
public class OccurrencesOfElement {

    public static int countOccurrences(int[] nums, int target) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == target) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 2, 2, 5};
        int target1 = 2;
        System.out.println(countOccurrences(nums1, target1));  // Output: 3

        int[] nums2 = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1};
        int target2 = 1;
        System.out.println(countOccurrences(nums2, target2));  // Output: 5

        int[] nums3 = {1, 2, 3};
        int target3 = 4;
        System.out.println(countOccurrences(nums3, target3));  // Output: 0
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array `nums`. This is because we make a single pass through the array.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(1), as we are only using a single integer counter, which does not depend on the input size.
