[Leetcode 3111. Minimum Rectangles to Cover Points](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3111)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D grid and a list of points on this grid. Your task is to find the minimum number of rectangles that can be used to cover all the given points. Each rectangle's sides must be parallel to the grid axes.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**: What is the range of coordinates for the points? Is there a maximum value for the coordinates of the points?
2. **Input Format**: Are the points guaranteed to be distinct? How are they provided (e.g., as a list of pairs)?
3. **Rectangles**: Can the rectangles overlap? Do they have to be of a minimum size, or can they be single-point rectangles?
4. **Output**: What should the output look like? Should it be an integer representing the minimum number of rectangles, or should the actual rectangles be listed?

### Assumptions and Strategy

1. **Coordinate Range**: Suppose the coordinates are within a reasonable range (e.g., \( [-10^4, 10^4] \)).
2. **Distinct Points**: Assume each point is unique.
3. **Minimal Rectangles**: Rectangles could be as small as one point.
4. **Output**: Return the minimum number of rectangles needed.

To solve the problem, we can use a greedy approach. We'll try to cover the points with the largest possible rectangles iteratively until all points are covered:

1. **Initialize**: Track points that still need to be covered.
2. **Select Rectangle**: Find the maximum bounding rectangle (with axes alignment) that covers some uncovered points.
3. **Update**: Remove covered points from the list and repeat until all points are covered.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MinimumRectanglesCoverPoints {
    public int minRectanglesToCoverPoints(int[][] points) {
        Arrays.sort(points, (a, b) -> a[0] == b[0] ? a[1] - b[1] : a[0] - b[0]);

        Set<List<Integer>> pointSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (int[] point : points) {
            pointSet.add(Arrays.asList(point[0], point[1]));
        }

        int rectangles = 0;
        while (!pointSet.isEmpty()) {
            int[] topLeft = new int[] { points[0][0], points[0][1] };
            int[] bottomRight = new int[] { points[0][0], points[0][1] };

            for (int[] point : points) {
                if (pointSet.contains(Arrays.asList(point[0], point[1]))) {
                    topLeft[0] = Math.min(topLeft[0], point[0]);
                    topLeft[1] = Math.min(topLeft[1], point[1]);
                    bottomRight[0] = Math.max(bottomRight[0], point[0]);
                    bottomRight[1] = Math.max(bottomRight[1], point[1]);
                }
            }

            Set<List<Integer>> pointsCovered = new HashSet<>();
            for (int i = topLeft[0]; i <= bottomRight[0]; i++) {
                for (int j = topLeft[1]; j <= bottomRight[1]; j++) {
                    if (pointSet.contains(Arrays.asList(i, j))) {
                        pointsCovered.add(Arrays.asList(i, j));
                    }
                }
            }

            pointSet.removeAll(pointsCovered);
            rectangles++;
        }

        return rectangles;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumRectanglesCoverPoints solution = new MinimumRectanglesCoverPoints();
        int[][] points = { {1, 3}, {2, 8}, {3, 4}, {5, 7}, {8, 10} };
        System.out.println(solution.minRectanglesToCoverPoints(points)); // Expected output: At least one
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

Let's analyze the time complexity of the approach:

1. **Sorting**: The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of points.
2. **Iterate and Update**:
    - Each rectangle determination involves potentially iterating through all points, which is \(O(n)\).
    - Removing the points covered by each rectangle further reduces the effective size of the problem per iteration.

In the worst case, if each point must be enclosed by an individual rectangle, then the solution's time complexity is \(O(n^2)\), as each point is processed during each iteration till all points are covered.

This approach should be efficient for moderately sized inputs but note that further optimizations may be necessary for very large sets of points.
