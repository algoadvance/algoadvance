[Leetcode 3011. Find if Array Can Be Sorted](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3011)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `arr` of length `n`. Your task is to determine if the array can be sorted in ascending order by performing at most one swap between any two elements.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the array always non-empty?**  
   Yes, the length `n` is guaranteed to be at least 1.
   
2. **What should we return if the array length is 1?**  
   A single element array is considered sorted, so we should return `true`.

3. **What values can the array elements take?**  
   Array elements can be any integers within the range of Java's integer type.

4. **Should the swap result in the array being sorted strictly in ascending order?**  
   Yes, the array should be sorted strictly in ascending order after at most one swap operation.

### Strategy
1. **Initial Observations:**
   - If the array length is 1, it is already sorted.
   - For larger arrays, determine where elements are out of order.

2. **Logic:**
   - Traverse the array to find pairs of elements that are not in ascending order.
   - If there are more than two such inversions, it's impossible to sort the array with a single swap.
   - If there are one or zero inversions, the array is already sorted or can be sorted by swapping the identified out-of-order elements.

3. **Implementation Steps:**
   1. Traverse the array and identify indices where order is violated.
   2. If the number of such indices is more than two, return `false`.
   3. Otherwise, check if swapping the identified elements sorts the array.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean canBeSortedWithOneSwap(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        
        // Edge case: An array of length 1 is always sorted.
        if (n == 1) return true;
        
        // Variables to store indices of the elements to be swapped
        int first = -1, second = -1;
        
        // Find indices where the array is not sorted
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
                if (first == -1) {
                    first = i;
                } else if (second == -1) {
                    second = i + 1;
                } else {
                    return false; // More than 2 spots where array is not sorted
                }
            }
        }
        
        // If no out of order elements found, array is already sorted
        if (first == -1) return true;
        
        // Edge case: second might not be set correctly if we only enter one if condition
        if (second == -1) {
            second = first + 1;
        }

        // Swap the elements at first and second indices
        swap(arr, first, second);
        
        // Check if the array is sorted
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }

    private void swap(int[] arr, int i, int j) {
        int temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[j];
        arr[j] = temp;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The algorithm performs a single traversal of the array to find the out-of-order indices and another traversal to verify if the array is sorted after a swap.
- **Time complexity:** O(n)
- **Space complexity:** O(1) since we use a constant amount of extra space.

This approach efficiently determines whether the array can be sorted with at most one swap by carefully identifying the misplaced elements and validating the swap.
