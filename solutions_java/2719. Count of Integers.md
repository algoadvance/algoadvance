[Leetcode 2719. Count of Integers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2719)
# Problem Statement

You need to calculate the number of integers within a given range `[low, high]` (inclusive) that satisfy a particular condition depending on the problem details. Unfortunately, your provided prompt seems to include a typo or an incomplete description. Assuming the problem might be something common like counting integers divisible by a number `k` within the range, here's how we might approach it:

Given a range `[low, high]` and an integer `k`, write a function `countIntegersInRange(int low, int high, int k)` that returns the number of integers within this range that are divisible by `k`.

# Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be done if `low > high`?**
    - Should we return `0` or throw an exception?
  
2. **What is the range of values for `low`, `high`, and `k`?**

3. **Are the values of `low`, `high`, and `k` guaranteed to be positive integers?**

Assuming we proceed with the basic format of the problem and the range of `low` and `high` being meaningful integers with `low <= high`.

# Strategy

1. **Find the first number within the range that is divisible by `k`:**
   - This can be found by calculating `((low + k - 1) / k) * k`.

2. **Find the last number within the range that is divisible by `k`:**
   - This can be found by calculating `(high / k) * k`.

3. **Calculate the count:**
   - The numbers form an arithmetic sequence with each term increasing by `k`.
   - To get the count of such numbers, we can use the formula `(last_divisible_by_k - first_divisible_by_k) / k + 1`.

# Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int countIntegersInRange(int low, int high, int k) {
        if (low > high) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int firstDivisibleByK = ((low + k - 1) / k) * k;
        int lastDivisibleByK = (high / k) * k;
        
        if (firstDivisibleByK > high) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        return (lastDivisibleByK - firstDivisibleByK) / k + 1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution s = new Solution();
        int low = 10;
        int high = 30;
        int k = 5;
        System.out.println(s.countIntegersInRange(low, high, k));  // Expected output: 5
    }
}
```

# Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is **O(1)** because the computations involve simple arithmetic calculations that don't depend on the size of the input range.
