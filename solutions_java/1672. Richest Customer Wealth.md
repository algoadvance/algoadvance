[Leetcode 1672. Richest Customer Wealth](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1672)
### Problem Statement
You are given an `m x n` integer grid `accounts` where `accounts[i][j]` is the amount of money the `i`-th customer has in the `j`-th bank account. Return the wealth that the richest customer has.

A customer's wealth is the amount of money they have in all their bank accounts. The richest customer is the customer that has the maximum wealth.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: accounts = [[1,2,3],[3,2,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation: 
1st customer has wealth = 1 + 2 + 3 = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 3 + 2 + 1 = 6
Both customers are considered the richest with a wealth of 6 each, so return 6.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: accounts = [[1,5],[7,3],[3,5]]
Output: 10
Explanation: 
1st customer has wealth = 1 + 5 = 6
2nd customer has wealth = 7 + 3 = 10
3rd customer has wealth = 3 + 5 = 8
The 2nd customer is the richest with a wealth of 10.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: accounts = [[2,8,7],[7,1,3],[1,9,5]]
Output: 17
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the accounts array be empty?
   - No, there will be at least one customer and one bank account.
   
2. What are the ranges of the values within the accounts array?
   - The typical constraints for such problems: 1 <= m, n <= 50 and 1 <= accounts[i][j] <= 100.

### Strategy
- Iterate through each customer.
- For each customer, compute the sum of all bank accounts they have.
- Keep track of the maximum wealth encountered during these iterations.
- Return the maximum wealth.

### Code
Here is the Java code implementation:

```java
public class RichestCustomerWealth {
    public static int maximumWealth(int[][] accounts) {
        int maxWealth = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < accounts.length; i++) {
            int currentWealth = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < accounts[i].length; j++) {
                currentWealth += accounts[i][j];
            }
            if (currentWealth > maxWealth) {
                maxWealth = currentWealth;
            }
        }
        
        return maxWealth;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] accounts1 = { {1, 2, 3}, {3, 2, 1} };
        System.out.println(maximumWealth(accounts1)); // Output: 6
        
        int[][] accounts2 = { {1, 5}, {7, 3}, {3, 5} };
        System.out.println(maximumWealth(accounts2)); // Output: 10
        
        int[][] accounts3 = { {2, 8, 7}, {7, 1, 3}, {1, 9, 5} };
        System.out.println(maximumWealth(accounts3)); // Output: 17
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is O(m * n), where `m` is the number of customers and `n` is the number of bank accounts per customer. This is because we need to traverse each entry in the `accounts` matrix once to compute the wealth of each customer.
- The space complexity is O(1) (constant space), since no additional space proportional to the input size is used. Only a few variables are used to keep track of the current and maximum wealth.
