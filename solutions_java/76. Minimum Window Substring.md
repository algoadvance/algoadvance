[Leetcode 76. Minimum Window Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l76)
## Problem Statement 
Given two strings `s` and `t` of lengths `m` and `n` respectively, return the minimum window substring of `s` such that every character in `t` (including duplicates) is included in the window. If there is no such substring, return an empty string `""`.

The test cases will be generated such that the answer is unique.

Example:
```
Input: s = "ADOBECODEBANC", t = "ABC"
Output: "BANC"
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can we assume that `s` and `t` will always be in lowercase or uppercase letters?**
   - Yes, we can assume that.

2. **What if the length of `t` is greater than the length of `s`?**
   - Since it's guaranteed by the problem statement that there exists a unique answer, this situation won't occur.

3. **Should we consider continuous or discontinuous substrings of `s`?**
   - Only continuous substrings of `s` should be considered.

4. **Can there be multiple valid answers in terms of minimum length?**
   - No, the problem guarantees the answer is unique.

## Strategy
We will use the sliding window technique combined with a frequency counter to keep track of the characters in `t` and their current counts within a window in `s`.

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Two pointers to maintain the window (`left` and `right`).
   - A hashmap to keep track of character frequency in `t`.
   - A hashmap to keep track of the current window's character frequencies.
   - Variables to store the minimum window length and its starting index.

2. **Expand and Contract the Window**:
   - Expand the window by moving `right` and include characters until we have all characters of `t`.
   - Contract the window from the `left` to find the smallest window containing all characters of `t`.

3. **Conditions**:
   - When moving the `right` pointer, update the window frequency of included characters.
   - When all characters are included, try to minimize the window by moving the `left` pointer.
   - Keep track of the minimum window length and update when a smaller valid window is found.

4. **End Condition**:
   - Continue until the `right` pointer goes past the end of `s`.

## Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class MinimumWindowSubstring {
    public String minWindow(String s, String t) {
        if (t.length() > s.length()) return "";

        // Frequency map for characters in t
        Map<Character, Integer> tFreq = new HashMap<>();
        for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
            tFreq.put(c, tFreq.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }

        // Pointers and counting variables
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        int minLeft = 0, minLen = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int required = tFreq.size();
        int formed = 0;

        // Frequency map for current window in s
        Map<Character, Integer> windowFreq = new HashMap<>();

        while (right < s.length()) {
            char c = s.charAt(right);
            windowFreq.put(c, windowFreq.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);

            if (tFreq.containsKey(c) && windowFreq.get(c).intValue() == tFreq.get(c).intValue()) {
                formed++;
            }

            while (left <= right && formed == required) {
                c = s.charAt(left);

                // Update the minimum window if the current one is smaller
                if (right - left + 1 < minLen) {
                    minLen = right - left + 1;
                    minLeft = left;
                }

                // Contract the window from the left
                windowFreq.put(c, windowFreq.get(c) - 1);
                if (tFreq.containsKey(c) && windowFreq.get(c).intValue() < tFreq.get(c).intValue()) {
                    formed--;
                }
                left++;
            }

            right++;
        }

        return minLen == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? "" : s.substring(minLeft, minLeft + minLen);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumWindowSubstring sol = new MinimumWindowSubstring();
        System.out.println(sol.minWindow("ADOBECODEBANC", "ABC")); // Expected output: "BANC"
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(m + n) where `m` is the length of `s` and `n` is the length of `t`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m + n) to store the frequency maps for `s` and `t`.

This solution efficiently finds the minimum window substring using the sliding window technique combined with frequency counting in linear time.
