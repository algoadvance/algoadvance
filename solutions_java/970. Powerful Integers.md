[Leetcode 970. Powerful Integers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l970)
## Problem Statement
Given two positive integers `x` and `y`, an integer `bound`, return a list of all the powerful integers that have a value less than or equal to bound.

A powerful integer is an integer that can be expressed as `x^i + y^j` for some integers `i >= 0` and `j >= 0`.

You can return the answer in any order. Duplicate values in the answer are allowed.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: x = 2, y = 3, bound = 10
Output: [2,3,4,5,7,9,10]
Explanation: 
2 = 2^0 + 3^0
3 = 2^1 + 3^0
4 = 2^0 + 3^1
5 = 2^1 + 3^1
7 = 2^2 + 3^1
9 = 2^3 + 3^0
10 = 2^1 + 3^2
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can `x` or `y` be 1? → (Yes, `x` and `y` can be 1).
2. Are `x` and `y` always integers and positive? → (Yes, they are guaranteed to be positive integers).
3. Is `bound` always a positive integer? → (Yes, bound is guaranteed to be a positive integer).

## Strategy
1. Use two nested loops to iterate over possible values of `i` and `j` such that `x^i + y^j <= bound`.
2. Use sets to avoid duplicate values.
3. Break the loops early if `x^i` or `y^j` exceed the bound to save unnecessary computations.
4. Return the list of powerful integers from the set.

## Code
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Set;

public class PowerfulIntegers {
    public List<Integer> powerfulIntegers(int x, int y, int bound) {
        Set<Integer> powerfulInts = new HashSet<>();
        int valX = 1;
        
        for (int i = 0; valX <= bound; i++) {
            int valY = 1;
            
            for (int j = 0; valX + valY <= bound; j++) {
                powerfulInts.add(valX + valY);
                
                if (y == 1) break;
                valY *= y;
            }
            
            if (x == 1) break;
            valX *= x;
        }
        
        return new ArrayList<>(powerfulInts);
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PowerfulIntegers pi = new PowerfulIntegers();
        System.out.println(pi.powerfulIntegers(2, 3, 10));  // Output: [2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10]
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
1. If `x` and `y` are both greater than 1, the number of iterations is `O(log_x(bound) * log_y(bound))`.
2. If either `x` or `y` is 1, the iterations for that variable become constant, and the complexity is reduced to `O(log_n(bound))` for the other variable.
 
This is an efficient approach given the constraints of the problem.
