[Leetcode 1681. Minimum Incompatibility](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1681)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` consisting of `n * k` integers where there are `n` unique integers each repeated `k` times, you need to distribute these integers into `k` groups such that each group contains exactly `n` unique integers. The incompatibility of a group is defined as the difference between its largest and smallest integers. The incompatibility of the distribution is the sum of the incompatibilities of all groups. Return the minimum incompatibility of the distribution, or -1 if it's not possible to distribute the integers as described.

### Example

- Input: `nums = [1,2,1,4], k = 2`
- Output: `4`
  - Explanation: The optimal distribution is [1,2] and [1,4], where the incompatibilities are (2-1) + (4-1) = 4.

- Input: `nums = [6,3,8,1,3,1,2,4,7,2], k = 2`
- Output: `6`
  - Explanation: The optimal distribution is [1,2,3,4,7] and [1,2,3,6,8], where the incompatibilities are (2-1) + (8-6) = 6.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Is each number guaranteed to appear exactly `k` times in the input array? 
   - Yes, each number is guaranteed to appear exactly `k` times.
   
2. Are all numbers in the input integer array positive?
   - Yes, they are positive integers.

3. Could `k` be any integer value including one larger than the length of `nums`?
   - No, the constraints ensure that `n * k == nums.length`. Therefore, `k` can only take values such that `n * k` matches `nums.length`.

## Strategy

1. **Initial Checks**: If `nums` cannot be divided into groups of the specified size, return -1. Also, check the frequency of each number to ensure there are no groups with fewer or more than `n` elements.

2. **Backtracking**: Use a recursive backtracking approach to try and divide the `nums` array into valid groups and compute their incompatibilities. Maintain state to check the current distribution and associated incompatibilities.

3. **Prune Suboptimal Paths**: Use memoization to keep track of the minimum incompatibility found for any subset of numbers.

4. **Bitmasking**: Use bitmasking for efficient representation of states and subsets, allowing dynamic programming solutions to manage the problem space effectively.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MinimumIncompatibility {
    
    public int minimumIncompatibility(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length / k; // Size of each group
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int[] dp = new int[1 << nums.length];
        Arrays.fill(dp, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        dp[0] = 0;
        
        for(int mask = 0; mask < (1 << nums.length); mask++) {
            if(Integer.bitCount(mask) % n != 0) continue;
            
            int curr = dp[mask];
            if (curr == Integer.MAX_VALUE) continue;
            
            for(int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
                if((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) continue;
                int newMask = mask | (1 << i);
                for(int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                    if((newMask & (1 << j)) != 0) continue;
                    if(nums[j] == nums[i]) break;
                    int finalMask = newMask | (1 << j);
                    dp[finalMask] = Math.min(dp[finalMask], curr + nums[j] - nums[i]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        int result = dp[(1 << nums.length) - 1];
        return result == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumIncompatibility solution = new MinimumIncompatibility();
        
        int[] nums1 = {1, 2, 1, 4};
        int k1 = 2;
        System.out.println(solution.minimumIncompatibility(nums1, k1)); // Output: 4
        
        int[] nums2 = {6, 3, 8, 1, 3, 1, 2, 4, 7, 2};
        int k2 = 2;
        System.out.println(solution.minimumIncompatibility(nums2, k2)); // Output: 6
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The above solution has a time complexity of O(2^m * m^2 * k), where `m` is the length of the nums array. This is due to the need to check every possible subset combination of nums and every pair within these subsets repeatedly using dynamic programming and bitmasking operations.
