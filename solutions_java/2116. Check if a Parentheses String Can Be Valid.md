[Leetcode 2116. Check if a Parentheses String Can Be Valid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2116)
## Problem Statement

**2116. Check if a Parentheses String Can Be Valid**

You are given a parentheses string `s` and an integer `locked`. A parentheses string is valid if and only if:

1. It is the empty string, contains only lowercase characters, or 
2. It can be written as AB (A concatenated with B), where A and B are valid strings, or
3. It can be written as (A), where A is a valid string.

A `locked` string is a binary string (one and zero string) where every 1 means the character at that position of `s` cannot be changed, and every 0 means the character can be changed.

Return `true` if you can make the string `s` valid by using at most one move of swapping two adjacent characters, or any other single valid string operation you can perform.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Is there any constraint on the length of the string `s`?
   - Yes, the length of `s` will be at most 10^5.
   
2. What characters can the string `s` contain?
   - `s` will consist only of the characters `(` and `)`.

3. Should we consider the string `locked` to be of the same length as `s`?
   - Yes, the string `locked` is of the same length as `s`.

4. Is there a single valid operation allowed, such as a swap of two adjacent characters?
   - Yes, any single valid string operation can be used to make `s` valid.

## Strategy

To determine if the parentheses string can be valid, follow these steps:

1. **Early Termination**: If the length of `s` is odd, it can never be a valid parentheses string; return `false`.

2. **Count Mismatched Parentheses**:
   - Iterate through `s` while keeping counters for open `(` and close `)` parentheses.
   - Track positions of unlocked parentheses separately to see where swaps can be made.

3. **Use Subsidiary Arrays**:
   - Use two subsidiary arrays to count `open` and `close` parentheses up to a certain point.
   - Traverse the string and generate counts based on unlocked and locked positions.

4. **Balance Check**:
   - Ensure that the total count of locked parentheses is balanced and can be balanced by at most one operation.
   - The difference should not exceed the count of available changes positions.

Incorporating these steps into an algorithm ensures efficient processing given the constraints.

## Code

Here is the Java code to solve the problem:

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean canBeValid(String s, String locked) {
        int n = s.length();
        if (n % 2 != 0) {
            // If the length of s is odd, it can never be valid
            return false;
        }
        
        int openLocked = 0, closeLocked = 0, unlocked = 0;

        // From left to right
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (locked.charAt(i) == '0') {
                unlocked++;
            } else {
                if (s.charAt(i) == '(') {
                    openLocked++;
                } else {
                    closeLocked++;
                }
            }
            if (closeLocked > openLocked + unlocked) {
                // Too many closing parentheses at any point
                return false;
            }
        }

        openLocked = 0; 
        closeLocked = 0;
        unlocked = 0;

        // From right to left
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (locked.charAt(i) == '0') {
                unlocked++;
            } else {
                if (s.charAt(i) == '(') {
                    openLocked++;
                } else {
                    closeLocked++;
                }
            }
            if (openLocked > closeLocked + unlocked) {
                // Too many opening parentheses at any point
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because we traverse the string twice (once from left to right, and once from right to left), performing constant-time operations to update and check counters on each iteration. This ensures efficient handling even for strings at the upper length limit.
