[Leetcode 3031. Minimum Time to Revert Word to Initial State II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3031)
### Problem Statement

You are given two strings word1 and word2 of length `n` each. Your goal is to transform `word1` into `word2` by performing a series of allowed operations:

1. Choose any character from `word1` and put it at the beginning of `word1`.

Each operation's time is equal to the 1-based position of the chosen character. You need to determine the minimum time required to transform `word1` into `word2` using the allowed operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Can the strings contain only lowercase English letters?
   - Will the strings always be of the same length `n`?
   - What is the maximum length `n` for the strings?

2. **Allowed Operations**:
   - Is there a limit to the number of operations that can be performed?
   - Can the operations be performed in any order?

3. **Output**:
   - Should the output be the exact minimum time to perform the transformation?

Assuming typical constraints such as:
- 1 <= n <= 1000
- Strings consist only of lowercase English letters.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Each character’s position is critical for calculating the operation’s cost.
   - The goal is to match the positions of characters in `word1` to those in `word2` with minimum cost.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Use dynamic programming to keep track of costs and transitions.
   - Define `dp[i][j]` as the minimum cost to transform the first `i` characters of `word1` to match the first `j` characters of `word2`.

3. **Transition States**:
   - Handle the move of each character optimally, updating the cost of each position correctly.

4. **Time Complexity**:
   - Given the constraints, an O(n^2) solution would be feasible.

### Code

```java
public class MinimumTimeToRevertWordToInitialState {
    public int minTime(String word1, String word2) {
        int n = word1.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][n + 1];
        
        // Initialize the dp array
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2;
            }
        }
        dp[0][0] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
                if (i < n) {
                    // Move i-th character
                    dp[i + 1][j] = Math.min(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j]);
                }
                if (i > 0 && j > 0 && word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    // Count the cost of moving
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - 1] + i);
                }
            }
        }
        
        int minCost = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            minCost = Math.min(minCost, dp[i][n]);
        }
        
        return minCost;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumTimeToRevertWordToInitialState solver = new MinimumTimeToRevertWordToInitialState();
        String word1 = "abc";
        String word2 = "bca";
        System.out.println(solver.minTime(word1, word2)); // Specific example, solution should return a cost
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2)
  - Nested for-loops iterating over the range `[0, n]`.
  - Each transition involves constant-time operations.

- **Space Complexity**: O(n^2)
  - Using a 2D array of size `(n + 1) x (n + 1)`.

The provided solution leverages dynamic programming to minimize the operational cost to transform `word1` into `word2` efficiently. Adjustments and optimizations can be made depending on specific constraints and further clarifications.
