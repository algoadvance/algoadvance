[Leetcode 1449. Form Largest Integer With Digits That Add up to Target](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1449)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of the `i+1`-th digit (1-indexed). You are also given an integer `target`. Return the largest integer you can paint under the following conditions:
1. The integer is painted with the digits 1-9, each digit `i` costs `cost[i-1]` units of paint.
2. The total cost used must be exactly equal to `target`.
3. If there is no way to paint any integer, return "0".

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be done if multiple largest numbers can be formed?**
   - Return any one of them.
   
2. **Is the `cost` array always of size 9 according to the given constraints?**
   - Yes, `cost` array is of length 9.

3. **Should we consider leading zeros in the result?**
   - No, we should not have any leading zeros in the result. 

4. **What is the range for the `target` value?**
   - The range for `target` is from 1 to 5000. 

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming approach to maximize the digits we can use to sum up to the target cost. Specifically:
1. **State definition:** We use a `dp` array where `dp[j]` represents the largest string that can be formed with the total cost `j`.
2. **Initialization:** Start with `dp[0]` as an empty string since there are no costs associated with zero total cost.
3. **Transition:** For each digit `d` from 1 to 9, and for each cost value from the digit's cost to the target, we update the `dp` value if including the current digit provides a larger number than previously computed.
4. **Return Result:** The value at `dp[target]` will give us the required largest integer. If it remains an empty string, we return "0".

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public String largestNumber(int[] cost, int target) {
        String[] dp = new String[target + 1];
        dp[0] = "";
        
        for (int t = 1; t <= target; t++) {
            dp[t] = "0";
            for (int d = 1; d <= 9; d++) {
                if (t >= cost[d - 1] && !dp[t - cost[d - 1]].equals("0")) {
                    String candidate = d + dp[t - cost[d - 1]];
                    candidate = sortDigits(candidate);
                    if (compare(candidate, dp[t]) > 0) {
                        dp[t] = candidate;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[target];
    }

    private String sortDigits(String number) {
        char[] chars = number.toCharArray();
        Arrays.sort(chars);
        StringBuilder sorted = new StringBuilder(new String(chars));
        return sorted.reverse().toString();
    }

    private int compare(String a, String b) {
        if (a.length() != b.length()) {
            return a.length() - b.length();
        }
        return a.compareTo(b);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n * target * 9), where \( n = 9 \). 
  - For each of the 9 digits, we iterate through each value up to `target`, with comparisons involving string concatenations and sorting which take O(log(target)).
  - Hence overall complexity is acceptable given the constraints.

- **Space Complexity:** O(target), where the `dp` array holds the information for each possible cost up to `target`, hence space used is linear with respect to `target`.

This solution leverages dynamic programming to build up the largest possible number by iteratively combining smaller solutions, which is efficient and effective for the given problem constraints.
