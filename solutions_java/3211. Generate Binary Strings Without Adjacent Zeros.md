[Leetcode 3211. Generate Binary Strings Without Adjacent Zeros](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3211)
### Problem Statement

The problem is to generate all binary strings of length `n` such that no two consecutive characters are `0`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the expected input and output?**
   - Input: An integer `n` denoting the length of the binary string.
   - Output: A list of binary strings of length `n` that do not have adjacent `0`s.

2. **Are there any constraints on the value of `n`?**
   - Typically constraints will be something like `1 <= n <= 15` or similar. Please confirm the exact constraints if provided.

3. **Do we have to return the result in any specific order?**
   - No specified order is necessary unless otherwise mentioned.

4. **Any specific storage limitations?**
   - Generally, no specific limitations, but we should aim for efficiency.

### Strategy

1. **Define the Base Case:**
   - For `n = 1`, the binary strings are `["0", "1"]`.

2. **Recursive Solution:**
   - Use a recursive helper function to generate the strings.
   - If the last character added is `1`, the next character can be `0` or `1`.
   - If the last character added is `0`, the next character must be `1`.
   
3. **Recursive Construction:**
   - Iterate through possible characters (`0` or `1`), avoiding two consecutive `0`.
   - Continue this until the desired length `n` is reached.

### Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class GenerateBinaryStrings {
    
    public static List<String> generateBinaryStrings(int n) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        if (n <= 0) return result;
        generateStringsHelper(result, "", n);
        return result;
    }
    
    private static void generateStringsHelper(List<String> result, String current, int n) {
        if (current.length() == n) {
            result.add(current);
            return;
        }
        
        // For the first character, we can add both '0' and '1'
        if (current.isEmpty()) {
            generateStringsHelper(result, current + "0", n);
            generateStringsHelper(result, current + "1", n);
        } else {
            char lastChar = current.charAt(current.length() - 1);
            if (lastChar == '0') {
                generateStringsHelper(result, current + "1", n);
            } else {
                generateStringsHelper(result, current + "0", n);
                generateStringsHelper(result, current + "1", n);
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 3; // Example input
        List<String> result = generateBinaryStrings(n);
        for (String s : result) {
            System.out.println(s);
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Recursive depth:** The recursion tree will have a depth of `n`.
- **Number of calls:** Each node will have either 1 or 2 further recursive calls depending on the current string.
- **Worst case:** The number of binary strings of length `n` is approximately bounded by `O(2^n)`. However, due to the constraint avoiding consecutive `0`s, the actual count will be significantly less, but bounded by this factor for upper limit considerations.

Thus, **Time Complexity** is `O(2^n)` for generating all possible combinations and ensuring no two consecutive `0`s in each string.
