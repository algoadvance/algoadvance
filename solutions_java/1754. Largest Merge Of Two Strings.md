[Leetcode 1754. Largest Merge Of Two Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1754)
### Problem Statement:
Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, you should return the largest string `merge` you can build using only the given strings `word1` and `word2`. The string `merge` should be built by alternately taking characters from `word1` and `word2` (if each character is taken from only one string).

### Example:
```
Input: word1 = "abcabc", word2 = "abdcaba"
Output: "abdcabcabcaba"

Input: word1 = "abc", word2 = "xyz"
Output: "xyzabc"
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can the inputs be empty strings?**
   - Yes, either (or both) of the inputs can be empty strings.
2. **What characters are the strings composed of?**
   - The strings consist of lowercase English letters only (a-z).

### Strategy:
1. **Comparative Approach:**
   - Use two pointers to traverse both `word1` and `word2`.
   - At each step, compare the substrings of `word1` and `word2` starting from the current pointers.
   - Append the lexicographically larger substring's first character to `merge` and move the respective pointer forward.
   - Continue the process until we exhaust both strings.

### Code:

```java
public class LargestMergeOfTwoStrings {
    public String largestMerge(String word1, String word2) {
        StringBuilder merge = new StringBuilder();
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < word1.length() || j < word2.length()) {
            if (i < word1.length() && j < word2.length()) {
                if (word1.substring(i).compareTo(word2.substring(j)) > 0) {
                    merge.append(word1.charAt(i++));
                } else {
                    merge.append(word2.charAt(j++));
                }
            } else if (i < word1.length()) {
                merge.append(word1.charAt(i++));
            } else {
                merge.append(word2.charAt(j++));
            }
        }
        return merge.toString();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LargestMergeOfTwoStrings solution = new LargestMergeOfTwoStrings();
        System.out.println(solution.largestMerge("abcabc", "abdcaba")); // Output: "abdcabcabcaba"
        System.out.println(solution.largestMerge("abc", "xyz")); // Output: "xyzabc"
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n * m), where `n` is the length of `word1` and `m` is the length of `word2`. This is because, in the worst case, each comparison of substrings could take O(n + m) time and we perform these comparisons up to `n + m` times.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n + m), where `n` is the length of `word1` and `m` is length of `word2`, to store the resulting merge.

This approach ensures building the lexicographically largest merge string efficiently with the given problem's constraints.
