[Leetcode 2222. Number of Ways to Select Buildings full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2222)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed binary string `s` which represents the kinds of buildings along a street where:
- `s[i] = '0'` indicates that the `i`-th building is an office.
- `s[i] = '1'` indicates that the `i`-th building is a restaurant.

As a city planner, you would like to select 3 buildings in a row such that it forms the sequence "010" or "101". Return the number of valid ways to select 3 buildings. 

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the maximum length of the string `s`?**
   - This helps in understanding potential time and space complexities.
2. **Are there any constraints on the input?**
   - For example, are there always at least three buildings?

With these clarifications, let's proceed to the solution.

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - We will count how many valid subsequences we can form using two auxiliary arrays or use counters.

2. **Approach**:
   - We need to count occurrences of the two patterns "010" and "101".
   - We can use three counters for different stages (left, mid, right transition states).

3. **Algorithm**:
   - Traverse the string once to count the occurrences of '0' and '1' and calculate potential subsequence patterns incrementally.

## Code

Here is the solution in Java:



```java
public class Solution {
    public long numberOfWays(String s) {
        long count0 = 0; // to count single '0's
        long count1 = 0; // to count single '1's
        long count10 = 0; // to count patterns of '10'
        long count01 = 0; // to count patterns of '01'
        long count010 = 0; // to count the final valid sequence '010'
        long count101 = 0; // to count the final valid sequence '101'

        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '0') {
                count010 += count10;
                count01++;
                count0++;
            } else if (c == '1') {
                count101 += count01;
                count10++;
                count1++;
            }
        }
        
        return count010 + count101;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string. We only traverse the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as we are using a fixed number of variables to count patterns.

This solution is efficient given the problem constraints and should perform well for large inputs.
