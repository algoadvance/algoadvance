[Leetcode 2509. Cycle Length Queries in a Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2509)
### Problem Statement

Given a binary tree in which each node has a unique integer value between `1` and `n`. For any two nodes in the tree, define a *cycle* as the path that starts at one node, goes up to their lowest common ancestor (LCA), and then down to the other node. The length of this cycle is the number of edges in the path. Given this tree, a list of queries is provided, where each query consists of two integers representing the nodes for which the cycle length is to be calculated.

You need to return the cycle length for each query.

**Example:**

```
Input: n = 3, queries = [[1,2],[1,3],[2,3]]
Output: [2,2,4]
Explanation:
For [1, 2], the cycle is 1 -> 2, cycle length = 2.
For [1, 3], the cycle is 1 -> 3, cycle length = 2.
For [2, 3], the cycle is 2 -> 1 -> 3 -> 1, cycle length = 4.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Tree structure**: Is this a binary search tree or just a regular binary tree? 
2. **Node values**: Can values be repeating, or are they guaranteed to be unique for each node?
3. **Tree representation**: How is the binary tree represented? Is it an adjacency list, an array-based heap, etc.?
4. **Constraints on Input Size**: What are the constraints on n and the number of queries?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Model the tree appropriately for easy LCA (Lowest Common Ancestor) calculation.
2. Use a method to find the LCA of two nodes. This might involve binary lifting or some depth-tracking mechanism.
3. Calculate the number of edges between two nodes using the LCA information.

**Steps:**
1. **Model the Tree**: Represent the tree such that we can easily move up to parent nodes. An array representation might be most suitable, where each index represents a node and the value represents the parent node.
2. **Find LCA**: For the given pair of nodes in each query, find their LCA.
3. **Calculate Path Length**: Sum the distances from each node to their LCA to get the total cycle length.

### Code

Here is a possible implementation:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class CycleLengthQueries {
    public List<Integer> cycleLengthQueries(int n, List<int[]> queries) {
        // Result list to store lengths
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Process each query
        for (int[] query : queries) {
            int u = query[0];
            int v = query[1];
            result.add(findCycleLength(u, v));
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    private int findCycleLength(int u, int v) {
        int lca = findLCA(u, v);
        return getDepth(u) + getDepth(v) - 2 * getDepth(lca);
    }
    
    private int findLCA(int u, int v) {
        Set<Integer> ancestorsU = new HashSet<>();
        
        // Collect all ancestors of u
        while (u != 0) {
            ancestorsU.add(u);
            u /= 2;
        }
        
        // Find the first common ancestor in v's path
        while (!ancestorsU.contains(v)) {
            v /= 2;
        }
        
        return v;
    }
    
    private int getDepth(int node) {
        // Calculate the depth of the node in the tree
        int depth = 0;
        while (node != 0) {
            node /= 2;
            depth++;
        }
        return depth;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CycleLengthQueries clq = new CycleLengthQueries();
        int n = 3;
        List<int[]> queries = Arrays.asList(new int[]{1, 2}, new int[]{1, 3}, new int[]{2, 3});
        List<Integer> result = clq.cycleLengthQueries(n, queries);
        System.out.println(result); // Output: [2, 2, 4]
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Tree Representation**:
   - Although the binary tree is abstract, we can simulate it with the property that in a perfect binary tree, the parent of node `i` is `i / 2`.

2. **LCA Calculation**:
   - Using a set, we first track all ancestors of node `u`.
   - Then, for node `v`, we keep moving to its parent until we find a common ancestor in the set of ancestors of `u`.

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - Depth calculation involves tracking the level by halving the node value repeatedly until reaching the root (node `0`).

### Time Complexity
- **Finding LCA**: O(log(n)), since halving the node index up to the root.
- **Calculating Depth**: O(log(n)) for each depth calculation.
- **Overall**: For each query, it will take O(log(n)).

Therefore, the solution is efficient for realistic values of `n` typically found in binary tree structures.
