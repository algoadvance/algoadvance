[Leetcode 119. Pascals Triangle II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l119)
## Problem Statement
Given an integer `rowIndex`, return the `rowIndex`th (0-indexed) row of the **Pascal's triangle**.

In **Pascal's triangle**, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it as shown:

```
Example:
Input: rowIndex = 3
Output: [1, 3, 3, 1]

Input: rowIndex = 0
Output: [1]

Input: rowIndex = 1
Output: [1, 1]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Minimum and Maximum Value of rowIndex**: What is the expected range for `rowIndex`? Typically it will be non-negative.
2. **Handling Large Inputs**: Do we need to consider integer overflow for large values?
3. **Constraints and Performance**: Are there any specific constraints or performance expectations?

For now, we will assume `rowIndex` is a non-negative integer and not extraordinarily large for normal computational purposes.

## Strategy
1. **Initialization**: Start with the first row `[1]`.
2. **Iteration**: For each subsequent row, compute each element as the sum of the two elements directly above it from the previous row.
3. **Return the Desired Row**: Stop once we reach the `rowIndex` row and return it.

We will use a single list and update it in place to maintain constant space complexity for this iterative approach.

## Code
```java
import java.util.*;

public class PascalTriangleII {
    public List<Integer> getRow(int rowIndex) {
        List<Integer> row = new ArrayList<>();
        row.add(1); // First row is always [1]
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= rowIndex; i++) {
            for (int j = row.size() - 1; j >= 1; j--) {
                row.set(j, row.get(j) + row.get(j - 1));
            }
            row.add(1); // Add the ending '1' for each row
        }
        
        return row;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PascalTriangleII solution = new PascalTriangleII();
        System.out.println(solution.getRow(3)); // Output: [1, 3, 3, 1]
        System.out.println(solution.getRow(0)); // Output: [1]
        System.out.println(solution.getRow(1)); // Output: [1, 1]
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(rowIndex^2)**, where `rowIndex` is the given input. This is due to the nested loop structure where we have to update the list for each row up to `rowIndex`.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity is **O(rowIndex)** because we use a single list to store the current row of Pascal's triangle, and its size grows linearly with `rowIndex`.
