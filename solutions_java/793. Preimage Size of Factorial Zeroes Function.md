[Leetcode 793. Preimage Size of Factorial Zeroes Function](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l793)
## Problem Statement
Let f(x) be the number of zeroes at the end of x!. Design a function that returns the number of different integer values of x such that f(x) is equal to a given number K.

**Example:**
```
Input: K = 0
Output: 5
Explanation: 0!, 1!, 2!, 3!, and 4! all have exactly 0 trailing zeroes.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: What is the range of input values for K?**
   - A: K is a non-negative integer, potentially very large (up to \(10^9\)).
2. **Q: Do we need to consider negative numbers?**
   - A: No, K is always non-negative.
3. **Q: What should be returned if there are no integers x that satisfy the condition?**
   - A: Return 0.

## Strategy
1. **Understanding Trailing Zeroes:** The number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a number x is determined by the number of times 10 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to x. Since 10 = 2 * 5, and the occurrence of the prime factor 2 is more frequent than 5, we need to count the number of times 5 is a factor in the numbers from 1 to x.

2. **Counting Trailing Zeroes:** The function to count trailing zeroes in x! can be computed as:
   ```
   f(x) = x // 5 + x // 25 + x // 125 + ...
   ```
   We sum the integer division of x by powers of 5 until the division result is 0.

3. **Finding Preimage Size:** To find the number of integers x such that f(x) = K:
   - Use a binary search approach to find the range of values that give exactly K trailing zeroes.

## Code

```java
public class FactorialZeroesFunction {

    public int preimageSizeFZF(int K) {
        // Helper function to count trailing zeroes in x!
        long countTrailingZeroes(long x) {
            long count = 0;
            while (x > 0) {
                x /= 5;
                count += x;
            }
            return count;
        }

        // Binary search for rightmost boundary where f(x) <= K
        long rightBoundary(long K) {
            long left = 0, right = Long.MAX_VALUE;
            while (left < right) {
                long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
                if (countTrailingZeroes(mid) > K) {
                    right = mid;
                } else {
                    left = mid + 1;
                }
            }
            return left;
        }

        // Binary search for leftmost boundary where f(x) >= K
        long leftBoundary(long K) {
            long left = 0, right = Long.MAX_VALUE;
            while (left < right) {
                long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
                if (countTrailingZeroes(mid) < K) {
                    left = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    right = mid;
                }
            }
            return left;
        }

        // Finding the range
        long left = leftBoundary(K);
        long right = rightBoundary(K);

        // If no valid x exists, return 0
        if (countTrailingZeroes(left) != K) return 0;
        
        return (int)(right - left);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FactorialZeroesFunction solution = new FactorialZeroesFunction();
        System.out.println(solution.preimageSizeFZF(0)); // Output: 5
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **countTrailingZeroes(x):** O(log x) due to repeated division by 5.
- **Binary Search:** Each binary search runs in O(log Y) where Y is the search range size (`Long.MAX_VALUE`).
- The whole algorithm runs in O(log Y log Y), which simplifies to O(log^2 Y). Given that we're using 64-bit integers, the maximum value of Y is around \(10^18\), meaning the complexity is manageable.
