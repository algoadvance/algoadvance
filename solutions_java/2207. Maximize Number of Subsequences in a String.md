[Leetcode 2207. Maximize Number of Subsequences in a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2207)
### Problem Statement

You are given two strings `text` and `pattern`. You can append either the first character or the second character of `pattern` at any position in `text` (including at the beginning or the end).

Return the maximum number of times `pattern` can occur as a subsequence in the resulting text.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum length of `text` and `pattern`?**
   - This helps in understanding potential performance issues.
   
2. **Can `text` and `pattern` contain special characters or are they limited to lowercase alphabets?**
   - This affects string operation assumptions.
   
3. **Is `pattern` always guaranteed to have exactly 2 characters?**
   - Based on the problem constraints, yes.

4. **What is a valid subsequence in this context?**
   - A subsequence means characters of `pattern` can be non-contiguously present in `text` while maintaining their order.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, consider the following steps:

1. **Count Occurrences as-is**:
   - First, count how many times `pattern` occurs in the original `text` as a subsequence.

2. **Maximized Insertions**:
   - Try inserting the first character of `pattern` at each possible position in `text` to see if it increases the count.
   - Do the same for the second character of `pattern`.

3. **Compare Counts**:
   - The maximum count achieved by either insertion (`first_char` or `second_char`) is the answer.

4. **Helper Function**:
   - Write a helper function to count occurrences of `pattern` as a subsequence in a given string.

### Code

```java
public class MaximizeSubsequences {
    
    public static int maximizeNumberOfSubsequences(String text, String pattern) {
        // Extract the two characters from the pattern
        char firstChar = pattern.charAt(0);
        char secondChar = pattern.charAt(1);

        // Initial counts when pattern is as it is
        int initialCount = countSubsequences(text, pattern);
        
        // Max count when inserting either character
        int maxCount = initialCount;

        // Try inserting the first character of the pattern
        for (int i = 0; i <= text.length(); i++) {
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(text);
            sb.insert(i, firstChar);
            int newCount = countSubsequences(sb.toString(), pattern);
            maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, newCount);
        }

        // Try inserting the second character of the pattern
        for (int i = 0; i <= text.length(); i++) {
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(text);
            sb.insert(i, secondChar);
            int newCount = countSubsequences(sb.toString(), pattern);
            maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, newCount);
        }

        // Return the maximum number of subsequences found
        return maxCount;
    }

    private static int countSubsequences(String text, String pattern) {
        // Two characters in the pattern
        char firstChar = pattern.charAt(0);
        char secondChar = pattern.charAt(1);

        // Variables to track counts
        int firstCharCount = 0;
        int subsequenceCount = 0;

        // Count subsequences in the current string
        for (char c : text.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == secondChar) {
                subsequenceCount += firstCharCount;
            }
            if (c == firstChar) {
                firstCharCount++;
            }
        }

        return subsequenceCount;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(maximizeNumberOfSubsequences("abdcdbc", "ac")); // Example
        System.out.println(maximizeNumberOfSubsequences("aabb", "ab")); // Example
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initial subsequence count**: \( O(n) \) where `n` is the length of `text`.
- **Character Insertions**: Requires \( O(n) \) operations for each insertion. With \( n \) possible positions for each character of `pattern`, this results in \( O(n^2) \) operations.
- **Total Complexity**: \( O(n^2) \).

This method ensures we consider all possible enhancements in subsequence counts by inserting the pattern's characters, while the subsequence counting itself is linear with respect to the length of the string.
