[Leetcode 2541. Minimum Operations to Make Array Equal II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2541)
### Problem Statement
You are given two integer arrays of equal length `nums1` and `nums2`. In one operation, you can choose any index `i` and modify either `nums1[i]` or `nums2[i]` by `1`.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make `nums1` == `nums2`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of Elements and Lengths**: What is the typical range of elements in the arrays, and how long can the arrays be?
   - Elements can be any integer, and the length of arrays (`n`) can be up to \(10^5\).
  
2. **Default Edge Cases**: Can the arrays have negative values, and are they always of equal length?
   - Yes, the arrays can have negative values and are guaranteed to be of equal length.

### Strategy
To minimize the operations, let's focus on the difference between the elements at each index. 

1. Compute the difference for each index: \( \text{diff}[i] = \text{nums1}[i] - \text{nums2}[i] \).
2. Sum up all these differences to get the total number of operations.
3. The minimum number of operations required to make `nums1` equal to `nums2` will be the sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements.

### Steps to Implement:
1. Initialize a variable to maintain the sum of operations.
2. Iterate over both arrays, compute the difference at each index, and sum the absolute differences.
3. Return the total sum as the result.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int minOperations = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums1.length; i++) {
            minOperations += Math.abs(nums1[i] - nums2[i]);
        }
        
        return minOperations;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the arrays. This is because we only need to iterate through the arrays once to compute the result.

### Explanation
- **Line 1-2**: Initialize the sum of operations to zero.
- **Line 3-5**: Iterate through the arrays, compute the absolute difference for each pair of elements, and add it to the sum.
- **Line 6**: Return the total sum of differences as the minimum operations needed.

This approach ensures that we achieve the minimum operations efficiently in linear time.
