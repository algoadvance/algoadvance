[Leetcode 1812. Determine Color of a Chessboard Square](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1812)
### Problem Statement

You are given a coordinate `coordinates` in the form of a string that represents the position of a square on a standard 8x8 chessboard. The string will consist of two characters:
- The first character will be a lowercase English letter representing the column (`a` through `h`).
- The second character will be a digit representing the row (`1` through `8`).

You need to return a boolean value indicating whether the square is white or not. A white square on a standard chessboard alternates with black squares: starting from the bottom-left corner (a1), which is a black square.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can input `coordinates` be invalid, or should we assume it is always valid as per the problem constraints?
   - **A:** You can assume the input coordinates will always be valid as per the problem constraints.

2. **Q:** Should the result be returned as `true` for white and `false` for black?
   - **A:** Yes, `true` should be returned for a white square and `false` for a black square.

### Strategy

The chessboard's alternating color pattern can be visualized with this insight:
- The column represented by letters `a` to `h` can be converted to a numerical index starting from 1 to 8.
- Combine the numeric values of the row and column indices, which represents the sum of the row and column indices.
- If the sum is even, the square is black; if it's odd, the square is white.

Here's how we can implement this strategy:
1. Convert the column letter to its corresponding numerical index.
2. Convert the row character to an integer.
3. Determine the color based on the parity (odd/even) of the sum of the indices.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean squareIsWhite(String coordinates) {
        // Convert the column character to a number (a -> 1, b -> 2, ..., h -> 8)
        int column = coordinates.charAt(0) - 'a' + 1;
        // Convert the row character to a number (1 -> 1, 2 -> 2, ..., 8 -> 8)
        int row = coordinates.charAt(1) - '0';

        // Return true if the sum of column + row is odd (white), otherwise false (black)
        return (column + row) % 2 != 0;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The solution has a constant time complexity since the operations performed (character conversion, addition, and modulo) all take constant time:
- **Time Complexity:** O(1)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

This solution efficiently determines the color of the chessboard square with minimal computational resources.
