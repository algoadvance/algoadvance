[Leetcode 1509. Minimum Difference Between Largest and Smallest Value in Three Moves](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1509)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. In one move, you can choose one element of `nums` and change it by any value.

Return the minimum difference between the largest and smallest value of `nums` after performing at most three moves.

#### Example:
```
Input: nums = [5,3,2,4]
Output: 0
Explanation: Change the array [5,3,2,4] to [2,2,2,2]. The difference between the largest and smallest value is 2-2 = 0.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: What is the length range of the input array `nums`?**
   - A: The length of `nums` can range from 1 to 10^5.

2. **Q: What is the range of values for the elements in `nums`?**
   - A: The values in `nums` range from `-10^9` to `10^9`.

3. **Q: What should be returned if the array has fewer than 4 elements?**
   - A: If the array has fewer than 4 elements, you can always change all elements to the same value in at most three moves, so return 0.

### Strategy

To achieve the minimum difference between the largest and smallest values in at most three moves, we can follow this strategy:

1. First, sort the array. Sorting helps us to easily find the largest and smallest values that can be affected by the three moves.
2. After sorting, we evaluate different scenarios where we can change up to three elements. The scenarios include:
   - Change the three largest elements to values that do not affect the smallest element.
   - Change the two largest elements and one smallest element.
   - Change the one largest element and two smallest elements.
   - Change the three smallest elements to values that do not affect the largest element.

3. The minimum difference from all these scenarios will give us the required result.

### Code

Here is the Java code that implements the above strategy:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MinimumDifference {
    public int minDifference(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        // If there are less than 4 elements, we can make all elements the same in at most 3 moves.
        if (n <= 3) return 0;
        
        // Sort the array to easily find the smallest and largest elements
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        
        // Evaluate the 4 scenarios
        int minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, nums[n-1] - nums[3]); // Change the three smallest elements
        minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, nums[n-2] - nums[2]); // Change two smallest and one largest
        minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, nums[n-3] - nums[1]); // Change one smallest and two largest
        minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, nums[n-4] - nums[0]); // Change the three largest elements
        
        return minDiff;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumDifference md = new MinimumDifference();
        System.out.println(md.minDifference(new int[]{5, 3, 2, 4})); // Output: 0
        System.out.println(md.minDifference(new int[]{1, 5, 0, 10, 14})); // Output: 1
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting** the array takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Finding the minimum difference** in constant time \(O(1)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sorting step.
