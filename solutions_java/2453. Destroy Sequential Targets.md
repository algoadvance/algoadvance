[Leetcode 2453. Destroy Sequential Targets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2453)
### Problem Statement

**LeetCode 2453: Destroy Sequential Targets**

Given an array `nums` of positive integers and an integer `space`, you want to select a subset of `nums` and destroy it sequentially. To destroy a target sequentially, every element in the subset should be chosen such that the difference between any two consecutive integers is exactly `space`.

Find and return the smallest possible number that can start such destruction.

Example:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [3, 7, 8, 9], space = 3
Output: 7
Explanation: 
We can select the subset [7, 10], or the subset [9, 12]. 
The smallest possible number is 7.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the size of `nums`?**
   * This will help us understand the potential efficiency requirements.
2. **Can `space` be zero or negative?**
   * This is crucial to understand the nature and limitations of the problem.
3. **Do we need to consider any sorting within the selected subset?**
   * This might impact performance decisions greatly.

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the Goal:**
   * The goal is to find the smallest possible number from which we can start destroying targets in a pattern where the difference between any two consecutive elements is exactly `space`.
   
2. **Translation to Modulus Operation:**
   * The problem will likely utilize the modulus operation. For each element `num` in `nums`, the sequence it can start is determined by `num % space`.
   
3. **Frequency Counting:**
   * Count the occurrences of each remainder when divided by `space`. The idea is to find the smallest integer which starts the destruction sequence that has the highest frequency of such starts. This guarantees a densely packed range for destruction.

4. **Iterate and Select:**
   * Iterate over the `nums` array while keeping track of the frequency of each starting point (using a map to count occurrences of each `num % space`). Finally, determine the smallest possible number using these frequencies.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    public int destroyTargets(int[] nums, int space) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Populate the frequency map
        for (int num : nums) {
            int remainder = num % space;
            frequencyMap.put(remainder, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(remainder, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        // Find the starting number with the highest frequency
        int maxFrequency = 0;
        int smallestNumber = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            int remainder = num % space;
            int frequency = frequencyMap.get(remainder);
            
            if (frequency > maxFrequency || (frequency == maxFrequency && num < smallestNumber)) {
                maxFrequency = frequency;
                smallestNumber = num;
            }
        }
        
        return smallestNumber;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

* **Calculating Remainder and Frequency Counting:**
  * Each element in `nums` is processed once to calculate its remainder and update the map.
  * **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the `nums` array.

* **Finding the Result:**
  * We iterate through `nums` again to determine the smallest starting number.
  * **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`.

Overall, the solution has a time complexity of `O(n)`, making it efficient given typical input size constraints for LeetCode problems.
