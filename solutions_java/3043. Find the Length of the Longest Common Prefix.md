[Leetcode 3043. Find the Length of the Longest Common Prefix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3043)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of strings `words`, find the length of the longest common prefix-out among all these strings. A prefix-out is defined as a common prefix of two or more strings in the array. If there is no common prefix, return 0.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What should we return if the `words` array is empty?
   - Return `0`.

2. Can the input array contain empty strings?
   - Yes, it can.

3. Are there any character constraints (e.g., lowercase, uppercase)?
   - Assume the input strings contain only lowercase English letters.

## Strategy

To solve this problem:
1. We need to find any common prefix between any two strings. The longest such prefix that is common across at least two strings will be our answer.
2. We can start by comparing each possible pair of strings to find their longest common prefix.
3. We need to keep track of the longest common prefix length found.

Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Create a helper function to find the common prefix of two strings.
2. Iterate through all pairs of strings in the `words` array.
3. For each pair, use the helper function to determine the length of their common prefix.
4. Track the maximum length found.
5. Return the maximum length as the result.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int longestCommonPrefixOut(String[] words) {
        // Edge case: if the array is empty
        if (words == null || words.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        int maxLength = 0;

        // Compare each pair of words
        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < words.length; j++) {
                int commonPrefixLength = commonPrefixLength(words[i], words[j]);
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, commonPrefixLength);
            }
        }

        return maxLength;
    }

    // Helper function to find the length of the common prefix of two strings
    private int commonPrefixLength(String a, String b) {
        int minLength = Math.min(a.length(), b.length());
        int i = 0;
        while (i < minLength && a.charAt(i) == b.charAt(i)) {
            i++;
        }
        return i;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        String[] words = {"flower", "flow", "flight"};
        System.out.println(sol.longestCommonPrefixOut(words));  // Output: 2 ("fl")

        words = new String[]{"dog", "racecar", "car"};
        System.out.println(sol.longestCommonPrefixOut(words));  // Output: 0

        words = new String[]{"interspecies", "interstellar", "interstate"};
        System.out.println(sol.longestCommonPrefixOut(words));  // Output: 5 ("inter")
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Outer Loop (i):** Iterates over `N` strings.
2. **Inner Loop (j):** Iterates over `N-1` remaining strings for each i.
3. **commonPrefixLength Function:** In the worst case, iterates `minLen` where `minLen` is the minimum length of the two compared strings.

The overall time complexity is:
- **O(N^2 \* L)** where `N` is the number of strings and `L` is the average length of the strings.

This makes the solution quadratic in terms of the number of strings, which is manageable for small to medium-sized arrays.
