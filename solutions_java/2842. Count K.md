[Leetcode 2842. Count K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2842)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, you are required to find the number of k-subsequences of the given string with maximum beauty. 

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. The beauty of a string is measured by the smallest lexicographical character in the string. 

Return the number of k-subsequences with maximum beauty. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is meant by "maximum beauty"?**
   - \( \text{Beauty of a string is the smallest lexicographical character, and "maximum beauty" is the maximum possible beauty value}\).

2. **Do we consider empty subsequences?**
   - No, k-subsequences should have exactly \( k \) characters.

3. **Is the input guaranteed to be valid?**
   - Yes, \( k \leq \text{length of s} \).

4. **Character Set:**
   - The string \( s \) contains only lowercase English letters.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use the following strategy:

1. **Frequency Count**:
   - Calculate the frequency of each character in the given string.

2. **Sorted Unique Characters**:
   - Sort the characters based on lexicographical order. Determine the smallest character that can provide the maximum subsequence beauty. 

3. **Select Top Characters**:
   - Select the characters contributing to the maximum beauty and generate all possible k-combinations using them.

4. **Combination Calculation**:
   - Use combinatorial methods to calculate the number of valid k-length subsequences.

5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - As the result can be large, use modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \) to keep the result within bounds.

### Approach
1. Traverse the string to count frequency of each character.
2. Identify the smallest lexicographical elements based on frequency needed to form k-subsequences.
3. Calculate the combinatorial counts via precomputed factorials to avoid recomputing combinations.
4. Return the result modulo \( 10^9 + 7 \).

### Code

Below is the Java code implementing the strategy:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    private static final int MOD = (int)(1e9 + 7);
    
    private long[] factorial;
    private long[] invFactorial;
    
    // Function to compute factorial and modular inverses
    private void computeFactorial(int n) {
        factorial = new long[n + 1];
        invFactorial = new long[n + 1];
        factorial[0] = 1;
        invFactorial[0] = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            factorial[i] = factorial[i - 1] * i % MOD;
        }
        
        invFactorial[n] = pow(factorial[n], MOD - 2);
        for (int i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            invFactorial[i] = invFactorial[i + 1] * (i + 1) % MOD;
        }
    }
    
    // Fast exponentiation to find modular inverse
    private long pow(long base, int exp) {
        long result = 1;
        while (exp > 0) {
            if ((exp & 1) > 0) {
                result = result * base % MOD;
            }
            base = base * base % MOD;
            exp >>= 1;
        }
        return result;
    }
    
    public int countKSubsequencesWithMaxBeauty(String s, int k) {
        int n = s.length();
        Map<Character, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            freq.put(c, freq.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        Character[] uniqueChars = freq.keySet().toArray(new Character[0]);
        Arrays.sort(uniqueChars);
        
        // The smallest lexicographical character can't provide k-length subsequence, return 0.
        if (uniqueChars.length < k) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        computeFactorial(n);
        
        // Get the k smallest unique characters and their frequencies
        long result = 1;
        int remaining = k;
        for (int i = 0; i < uniqueChars.length && remaining > 0; i++) {
            int count = Math.min(freq.get(uniqueChars[i]), remaining);
            result = result * binomialCoefficient(remaining, count) % MOD;
            remaining -= count;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    // Function to compute binomial coefficient
    private long binomialCoefficient(int n, int k) {
        if (n < k || k < 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        return factorial[n] * invFactorial[k] % MOD * invFactorial[n - k] % MOD;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.countKSubsequencesWithMaxBeauty("abacbca", 3)); // sample input
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Frequency Count**: \( O(n) \)
- **Sorting Unique Characters**: \( O(26 \log 26) \) which is \( O(1) \) since 26 is constant.
- **Combination Calculation**: \( O(k) \)

Overall time complexity is: \( O(n + k) \).

This approach efficiently counts k-subsequences of a string with maximum beauty using combinatorial methods and modular arithmetic to keep calculations manageable.
