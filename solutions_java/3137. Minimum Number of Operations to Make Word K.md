[Leetcode 3137. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Word K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3137)
### Problem Statement:
We are given a string `s` and an integer `k`, and we want to transform `s` into a k-periodic string with the minimum number of character replacements. A string is k-periodic if for every i, `s[i] == s[i+k]`. We need to calculate the minimum number of character replacements required to achieve this.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What are the constraints on the length of `s` and the value of `k`?**
   - Assume `1 <= k <= len(s) <= 10^5`.

2. **Are all characters in `s` lowercase alphabets?**
   - Yes, the problem assumes that `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

3. **Is there any additional information on the string or operations?**
   - No additional information is provided or needed.

### Strategy:
1. **Understand k-Periodic:**
   - A string is k-periodic if every k-th character from a position `i` matches, i.e., `s[i] == s[i+k] == s[i+2k]...`.

2. **Character Counting:**
   - Iterate over each group of characters that should match, count the frequency of each character within these groups.

3. **Calculate Minimum Replacements:**
   - For each group, calculate how many characters need to be changed such that the most frequent character in the group is the setting standard. This reduces the overall number of replacements needed.

### Code:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class MinKPeriodicOperations {
    public int minKPeriodicOperations(String s, int k) {
        int len = s.length();
        int minOperations = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            Map<Character, Integer> charFrequency = new HashMap<>();
            int maxFreq = 0;

            // Count frequency of characters in i, (i+k), (i+2k)...
            for (int j = i; j < len; j += k) {
                char currentChar = s.charAt(j);
                charFrequency.put(currentChar, charFrequency.getOrDefault(currentChar, 0) + 1);
                maxFreq = Math.max(maxFreq, charFrequency.get(currentChar));
            }

            // Calculate operations needed for the ith group
            int totalCharsInGroup = (len - i + k - 1) / k; // (len - i + k - 1) / k calculates the ceiling result of (len - i) / k
            minOperations += totalCharsInGroup - maxFreq;
        }
        return minOperations;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinKPeriodicOperations solver = new MinKPeriodicOperations();
        String s = "ababab";
        int k = 2;
        System.out.println(solver.minKPeriodicOperations(s, k)); // Expected output: 0
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`. This is because the algorithm processes each character in the string exactly once for counting, and each group also counts characters linearly with respect to the string length. Given the constraints, this approach will perform efficiently.
