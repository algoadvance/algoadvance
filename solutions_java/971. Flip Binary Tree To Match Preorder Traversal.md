[Leetcode 971. Flip Binary Tree To Match Preorder Traversal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l971)
## Problem Statement

Given a binary tree with `N` nodes, each node in the tree has a unique `node.val` in range `[1, N]`.

A node in the binary tree can be flipped by swapping the left child and the right child of that node.

Consider the preorder traversal of a binary tree of `N` nodes: a `node`, followed by the preorder traversal of the left child, then the preorder traversal of the right child.

Our goal is to flip the nodes in the binary tree so that the preorder traversal of the tree matches given list `voyage`.

Return a list of the values of all nodes flipped. You may return the answer in any order. If it is impossible to flip the nodes in the tree to make the preorder traversal match `voyage`, return the list `[-1]`.

### Example:
Given the following binary tree:
```
    1
   / \
  2   3
```

And the voyage `[1, 3, 2]`.

We can flip the node with value `1` to swap its children, making the tree:
```
    1
   / \
  3   2
```

The result of flipping will be `[1]`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the expected input format?**
   - The input will be a `TreeNode` root and a list `voyage`.
2. **What is the output format?**
   - The output should be a list of integers indicating the values of the nodes that were flipped. If not possible, return `[-1]`.
3. **Can the voyage contain duplicate values?**
   - No, each node in the tree has a unique value in the range `[1, N]`.

## Strategy

1. **Preorder Traversal:** 
   - We will use a preorder traversal to compare the nodes with the values in the `voyage` list.
2. **Flipping Condition:** 
   - If the left child of the current node does not match the next value in `voyage`, we need to flip the children of the current node.
3. **Recursive Function:** 
   - Use a recursive function to traverse the binary tree, comparing and flipping nodes as necessary.
4. **Tracking Index and Flips:** 
   - Maintain a current index to check against `voyage` and a list to record flips.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    private List<Integer> flips;
    private int index;
    
    public List<Integer> flipMatchVoyage(TreeNode root, int[] voyage) {
        flips = new ArrayList<>();
        index = 0;
        
        if (!dfs(root, voyage)) {
            return Arrays.asList(-1);
        }
        
        return flips;
    }
    
    private boolean dfs(TreeNode node, int[] voyage) {
        if (node == null) {
            return true;
        }
        
        if (node.val != voyage[index++]) {
            return false;
        }
        
        if (node.left != null && node.left.val != voyage[index]) {
            flips.add(node.val);
            return dfs(node.right, voyage) && dfs(node.left, voyage);
        }
        
        return dfs(node.left, voyage) && dfs(node.right, voyage);
    }
}

class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because each node is visited once during the traversal.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(H)`, where `H` is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack in the depth-first search (DFS).

If the tree is balanced, the height `H` is `O(log N)`. If the tree is skewed, `H` could be `O(N)`.
