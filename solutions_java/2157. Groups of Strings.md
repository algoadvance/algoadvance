[Leetcode 2157. Groups of Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2157)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of strings. Two strings are considered to belong to the same group if you can change one to the other by flipping any characters 'a' to 'z'. Write a function to identify the number of such groups.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the length range of the strings in the list?
   - Are the strings guaranteed to be lowercase?
   - Is there any limitation on the number of strings?

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - What exactly should be the output? Do we need to return the number of groups or group the strings and return the groups?

Once these questions are clarified and if there are still points that need to be addressed, please provide them.

### Strategy

The main strategy here is to use a Union-Find (Disjoint Set) data structure which allows us to efficiently group and find connected components (groups).

1. **Bitmask Representation**: 
   - Represent each string as a bitmask where each bit presence (1) or absence (0) denotes whether a character 'a' to 'z' is in the string or not.

2. **Union-Find Algorithm**:
   - Use Union-Find to group strings where a single character flip can transform one string into another.

3. **Operations**:
   - Iterate over each string and generate its bitmask.
   - For each bitmask, check if by flipping any one bit, the resulting bitmask exists or can be reached from any of the strings encountered so far.
   - Use union operations to group such strings.

4. **Output**:
   - Find the number of connected components which will give the number of groups.

### Time Complexity

- **Union-Find Operations**: O(α(N)), where N is the number of strings and α is the inverse Ackermann function.
- **Overall Complexity**: Since for each string we perform constant-time operations and Union-Find operations, the complexity is close to O(N).

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    class UnionFind {
        private int[] parent;
        private int[] rank;

        public UnionFind(int n) {
            parent = new int[n];
            rank = new int[n];
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                parent[i] = i;
                rank[i] = 1;
            }
        }

        public int find(int u) {
            if (u != parent[u])
                parent[u] = find(parent[u]);
            return parent[u];
        }

        public boolean union(int u, int v) {
            int rootU = find(u);
            int rootV = find(v);

            if (rootU == rootV) return false;

            if (rank[rootU] > rank[rootV]) {
                parent[rootV] = rootU;
            } else if (rank[rootU] < rank[rootV]) {
                parent[rootU] = rootV;
            } else {
                parent[rootV] = rootU;
                rank[rootU]++;
            }

            return true;
        }
    }

    public int groupStrings(String[] words) {
        int n = words.length;
        UnionFind uf = new UnionFind(n);
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int bitmask = 0;
            for (char ch : words[i].toCharArray())
                bitmask |= (1 << (ch - 'a'));

            if (map.containsKey(bitmask)) {
                uf.union(i, map.get(bitmask));
            } else {
                map.put(bitmask, i);
            }

            // Check flip each bit (total 26 bits)
            for (int k = 0; k < 26; k++) {
                int flipped = bitmask ^ (1 << k);
                if (map.containsKey(flipped)) {
                    uf.union(i, map.get(flipped));
                }
            }

            // Check single-remove (only if string has more than one character)
            for (int k = 0; k < 26; k++) {
                if ((bitmask & (1 << k)) != 0) {
                    int removed = bitmask ^ (1 << k);
                    if (map.containsKey(removed)) {
                        uf.union(i, map.get(removed));
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        Set<Integer> uniqueRoots = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            uniqueRoots.add(uf.find(i));
        }

        return uniqueRoots.size();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        String[] words = {"abc", "bcd", "ace"};
        System.out.println(sol.groupStrings(words)); // Output: Number of groups
    }
}
```

This code identifies the number of groups of strings such that each group contains strings transformable into each other by flipping one character.
