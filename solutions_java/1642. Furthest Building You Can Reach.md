[Leetcode 1642. Furthest Building You Can Reach](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1642)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `heights` representing the heights of buildings, some `bricks`, and some `ladders`.

You start your journey from building `0` and move to the next building by possibly using bricks or ladders. While moving from building `i` to building `i+1` (0-indexed), `

- If the current building's height is greater than or equal to the next building's height, you can move without any additional resources.
- If the current building's height is less than the next building's height, you will need `heights[i + 1] - heights[i]` bricks or one ladder to move to the next building.

Return the furthest building index (0-indexed) you can reach if you use the given ladders and bricks optimally.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the number of ladders and bricks be zero or negative? 
    - No, ladders and bricks will always be non-negative integers.
  
2. What is the size constraint of the `heights` array?
    - The size constraint for `heights` can go up to `10^5`.

3. Are we guaranteed that there is always a solution to reach at least the first building?
    - Yes, you are starting from building `0`, so you can always reach at least that.

### Strategy

1. Use a Min-Heap (Priority Queue) to keep track of the largest jumps (differences in height) we encounter where we use bricks.
2. Traverse the buildings and at each step:
    - Calculate the height difference to the next building.
    - If the height difference is positive:
        - Push the height difference into the Min-Heap.
        - If the size of the heap exceeds the number of ladders, remove the smallest element (the smallest jump), representing the use of bricks.
        - Deduct bricks accordingly. If at any point, the bricks required exceed the available bricks, return the last reached building index.
3. If we successfully traverse all the buildings, return the last building index.

### Code

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public class Solution {
    public int furthestBuilding(int[] heights, int bricks, int ladders) {
        // Min-Heap to keep track of the largest jumps (used for bricks)
        PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
        
        // Traverse through each building
        for (int i = 0; i < heights.length - 1; i++) {
            int diff = heights[i + 1] - heights[i];
            
            if (diff > 0) {  // Only consider positive differences
                minHeap.add(diff);
                
                // If more jumps than ladders, we'll use bricks for the smallest jump
                if (minHeap.size() > ladders) {
                    bricks -= minHeap.poll();
                }
                
                // If not enough bricks, return the current index
                if (bricks < 0) {
                    return i;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // If we've managed to traverse all buildings
        return heights.length - 1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] heights = {4, 2, 7, 6, 9, 14, 12};
        int bricks = 5;
        int ladders = 1;
        System.out.println(solution.furthestBuilding(heights, bricks, ladders));  // Output: 4
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Insertion into heap:** `O(log k)` where `k` is the number of ladders.
- **Traversal of buildings:** `O(n)` where `n` is the total number of buildings.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log k)`, which is efficient for large values of `n` up to `10^5`.

### Explanation

We use a greedy approach combined with a min-heap to prioritize the smallest jumps for our bricks when ladders are fully utilized. This ensures optimal use of resources to reach the furthest building possible.
