[Leetcode 713. Subarray Product Less Than K full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l713)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of contiguous subarrays where the product of all the elements in the subarray is strictly less than `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the input values?**
   - The length of the array `nums` will be between `1` and `3 * 10^4`.
   - Each element in `nums` will be between `1` and `1000`.
   - `k` will be between `1` and `10^6`.

2. **Are there any specific edge cases to consider?**
   - If `k` is less than or equal to 1, there can't be any valid subarray since all elements in the array are at least 1. We should return `0` in such cases.
   - Single-element subarrays should also be considered, where the element itself should be less than `k`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a sliding window (or two-pointer) technique. Here's the plan:

1. **Initialize Pointers and Variables**:
   - We need two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the current window of subarrays.
   - A variable `product` will keep track of the product of all elements in the current window.

2. **Expand and Shrink Window**:
   - Iterate the `right` pointer from the start to the end of the array.
   - For each `right` pointer position, multiply `product` by `nums[right]`.
   - While `product` is greater than or equal to `k`, move the `left` pointer to the right and divide `product` by `nums[left]` to shrink the window.
   - All subarrays ending at `right` and starting from any position between `left` and `right` are valid subarrays. Thus, add `right - left + 1` to the count of valid subarrays.

3. **Counting Valid Subarrays**:
   - This counts the number of valid subarrays and gives us the desired result.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int numSubarrayProductLessThanK(int[] nums, int k) {
        if (k <= 1) return 0;
        
        int product = 1, count = 0, left = 0;
        
        for (int right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
            product *= nums[right];
            
            while (product >= k) {
                product /= nums[left];
                left++;
            }
            
            count += right - left + 1;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
  - The algorithm processes each element of the array at most twice (once by the `right` pointer and at most once by the `left` pointer). Thus, the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count all subarrays with a product less than `k` by leveraging the sliding window technique to keep the product of the current window in check.
