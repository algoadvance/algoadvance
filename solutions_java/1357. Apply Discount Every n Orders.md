[Leetcode 1357. Apply Discount Every n Orders](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1357)
## Problem Statement
There is a shop, and one of the shop's operations is to apply a discount to every nth order. You need to implement the `Cashier` class:
- `Cashier(int n, int discount, int[] products, int[] prices)`: Initializes the object with `n`, the discount percentage, the list of `products`, and their respective `prices`.
- `getBill(int[] product, int[] amount)`: Returns the total bill for the products in the `product` array. `product[i]` is the ID of the ith product being bought and `amount[i]` is the number of units of that product being bought. If the bill is for every nth customer, a discount of `discount` percentage should be applied.

### Constraints:
- Each `product` in `product` and `amount` are guaranteed to be available in the store (no need to handle out-of-stock scenario).
- 1 <= product[i], amount[i] <= 1000.
- 1 <= n <= 10^4.
- 0 <= discount <= 100.
- It is guaranteed that the total bill will not exceed 10^6.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Question:** Are product IDs unique?
   **Answer:** Yes, each product ID is unique and corresponds to a price.

2. **Question:** Should discounts be compounded or applied once?
   **Answer:** The discount should be applied once to every nth customer.

3. **Question:** Will the `getBill` function always provide valid product IDs and amounts?
   **Answer:** Yes, it is stated that all provided product IDs and amounts will be valid.

4. **Question:** Do we need to handle multiple instances of the `Cashier` class in the same session?
   **Answer:** Yes, each instance should be able to work independently.

## Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Cashier {
    private int n;
    private int discount;
    private int orderCount;
    private HashMap<Integer, Integer> productPriceMap;

    public Cashier(int n, int discount, int[] products, int[] prices) {
        this.n = n;
        this.discount = discount;
        this.orderCount = 0;
        productPriceMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < products.length; i++) {
            productPriceMap.put(products[i], prices[i]);
        }
    }

    public double getBill(int[] product, int[] amount) {
        double total = 0.0;
        for (int i = 0; i < product.length; i++) {
            total += productPriceMap.get(product[i]) * amount[i];
        }
        orderCount++;
        if (orderCount % n == 0) {
            total -= (discount / 100.0) * total;
        }
        return total;
    }
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Store the discount parameters (`n` and `discount`).
   - Store the product prices in a map for quick lookup.
   - Initialize an `orderCount` to keep track of which order is being processed.

2. **Calculating the Bill:**
   - For each product in the current order, calculate the cost by looking up its price and multiplying by the amount.
   - Increment the order counter.
   - If the current order is the nth order, apply the discount.
   - Return the calculated bill.

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization (`Cashier` constructor):**
  - **Time Complexity:** O(m), where m is the number of products. This is due to the single pass required to fill the hashmap with products and prices.
  - **Space Complexity:** O(m), for storing prices in the hashmap.

- **Bill Calculation (`getBill` method):**
  - **Time Complexity:** O(k), where k is the number of products in the order. This is because we iterate through the list to sum up the total.
  - **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are only using a fixed amount of extra space independent of the input size.

This combination ensures that the program runs efficiently even with large inputs.
