[Leetcode 1488. Avoid Flood in The City](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1488)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `rains` where:
- `rains[i] > 0` means the `i-th` day will rain over the lake with id `rains[i]`.
- `rains[i] == 0` means the `i-th` day is a dry day and you can choose one lake to dry.

Return an array `ans` where:
- `ans[i] = -1` if `rains[i] > 0`.
- `ans[i] = x` if `rains[i] == 0` and on the `i-th` day you choose to dry lake `x`.

If it is not possible to avoid flooding, return an empty array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume that the `rains` array input will always be valid as per the given constraints?
2. What should we return if there are multiple valid solutions?
3. What are the constraints on the size of input array `rains` and the values of its elements?

### Strategy

1. **Tracking Full Lakes:** We need a way to track which lakes are full and could potentially cause a flood.
2. **Dry Day Decisions:** Use dry days optimally to prevent any lake from raining into itself without being dried first.
3. **Using Data Structures:**
   - Maintain a map to store the last day a lake was rained upon.
   - Use a sorted set (or tree set in Java) to efficiently retrieve the earliest dry day available to dry a specific lake.

### Implementation Strategy

1. Loop through each day in the rains array.
2. If it rains on day `i`, do the following:
   - If the lake is full (i.e., it has rained previously and is not yet dried), look for the earliest possible dry day to dry this lake using the sorted set.
   - If no such dry day is available, return an empty array indicating that it's not possible to avoid flooding.
   - Mark this lake as rained upon by updating the last rained day in the map.
3. If it is a dry day, store this day in the sorted set.
4. Return the final array of actions taken each day.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int[] avoidFlood(int[] rains) {
        int n = rains.length;
        // Result array
        int[] ans = new int[n];
        // Map to store the last seen day of a lake being rained upon
        Map<Integer, Integer> lakeToLastRainedDay = new HashMap<>();
        // TreeSet to handle the dry days
        TreeSet<Integer> dryDays = new TreeSet<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (rains[i] > 0) {
                // It is raining on lake rains[i]
                int lake = rains[i];
                if (lakeToLastRainedDay.containsKey(lake)) {
                    // Check for the earliest possible dry day
                    Integer dryDay = dryDays.higher(lakeToLastRainedDay.get(lake));
                    if (dryDay == null) {
                        // No dry day available before this day
                        return new int[0];
                    }
                    // Use the dry day
                    ans[dryDay] = lake;
                    dryDays.remove(dryDay);
                }
                // Mark this lake as rained on this day
                lakeToLastRainedDay.put(lake, i);
                ans[i] = -1;
            } else {
                // It is a dry day
                dryDays.add(i);
                ans[i] = 1; // Initialize as 1, will be updated if used
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **O(N log N)**: where N is the length of the `rains` array.
  - Each insertion and deletion operation in the TreeSet takes O(log N) time.
  - HashMap operations (put and get) generally take O(1) time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) for storing elements in the HashMap and TreeSet.

This solution ensures optimal usage of dry days and efficiently manages the potential flooding scenarios using appropriate data structures.
