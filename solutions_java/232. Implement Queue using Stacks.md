[Leetcode 232. Implement Queue using Stacks](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l232)
### Problem Statement

Implement a first in first out (FIFO) queue using only two stacks. The implemented queue should support all the functions of a normal queue (`push`, `pop`, `peek`, and `empty`).

Implement the `MyQueue` class:

- `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the back of the queue.
- `int pop()` Removes the element from the front of the queue and returns it.
- `int peek()` Returns the element at the front of the queue.
- `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the queue is empty, `false` otherwise.

Notes:
- You can only use standard stack operations (`push to top`, `peek/pop from top`, `size`, and `is empty`).
- You may assume that all operations are valid (for example, no calls to `pop` or `peek` will be made on an empty queue).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the values that can be pushed into the queue?
   - **A**: No, any integer values can be pushed into the queue.

2. **Q**: Can we use other data structures apart from two stacks for internal usage?
   - **A**: No, you are limited to using only two stacks.

3. **Q**: Is it necessary to handle exceptions for operations on an empty queue?
   - **A**: For this problem, you may assume that all operations are valid, so you do not need to handle exceptions.

### Strategy

To implement a queue using two stacks, we can use two main stacks:

1. **Input Stack (`stack_in`)**: Used to handle incoming elements via the `push` operation.
2. **Output Stack (`stack_out`)**: Used to handle outgoing elements for `pop` and `peek` operations.

The main idea is to transfer elements from the input stack to the output stack when needed, ensuring that the order of elements in the output stack is such that the topmost element is the front of the queue.

**Operations**:
- **Push**: Always push the new element onto `stack_in`.
- **Pop**: If `stack_out` is empty, transfer all elements from `stack_in` to `stack_out` (reversing their order). Then, pop the top element from `stack_out`.
- **Peek**: Similar to `pop`, but instead of popping the top element from `stack_out`, simply return it.
- **Empty**: Return `true` if both `stack_in` and `stack_out` are empty.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Stack;

class MyQueue {
    private Stack<Integer> stack_in;
    private Stack<Integer> stack_out;

    public MyQueue() {
        stack_in = new Stack<>();
        stack_out = new Stack<>();
    }

    public void push(int x) {
        stack_in.push(x);
    }

    public int pop() {
        if (stack_out.isEmpty()) {
            while (!stack_in.isEmpty()) {
                stack_out.push(stack_in.pop());
            }
        }
        return stack_out.pop();
    }

    public int peek() {
        if (stack_out.isEmpty()) {
            while (!stack_in.isEmpty()) {
                stack_out.push(stack_in.pop());
            }
        }
        return stack_out.peek();
    }

    public boolean empty() {
        return stack_in.isEmpty() && stack_out.isEmpty();
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Push**: \(O(1)\) as it just involves a simple `push` operation to the stack.
- **Pop**: \(O(n)\) in the worst case when `stack_out` is empty and elements need to be transferred from `stack_in`. However, amortized over a sequence of \(m\) operations, the complexity is \(O(1)\) per operation because each element is moved at most once.
- **Peek**: \(O(n)\) in the worst case due to the potential transfer from `stack_in` to `stack_out`, but similar to `pop`, the amortized complexity is \(O(1)\).
- **Empty**: \(O(1)\) as it only checks if both stacks are empty.

This implementation provides an efficient and correct solution to the problem of simulating a queue using two stacks.
