[Leetcode 2923. Find Champion I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2923)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers where each integer represents the points a player scored in a game. You need to identify the player who scored the maximum points and return that value. If there are multiple players with the same maximum points, return any one of them.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range:** Are there any constraints on the size of the array or the range of the integers?
   - Assume the array can have a size ranging from 1 to \(10^6\) and integer values can range from \(-10^6\) to \(10^6\).

2. **Return Value:** If there are multiple players with the same maximum points, can I return any one of them?
   - Yes, you can return any one of them.

3. **Edge Cases:** What should we return if the array is empty?
   - The array is guaranteed to have at least one element.

### Strategy
1. **Initialize a Variable:** Create a variable to keep track of the maximum points found so far.
2. **Iterate Through Array:** Loop through the array to compare each player's score with the current maximum points.
3. **Update Maximum Points:** If a higher score is found, update the maximum points.
4. **Return Result:** Once we have traversed the entire array, return the maximum points.

### Code

```java
public class FindChampion {
    public static int findChampion(int[] scores) {
        // Initial assumption that the maximum score is the first element
        int maxPoints = scores[0];
        
        // Loop through the array starting from the second element
        for (int i = 1; i < scores.length; i++) {
            if (scores[i] > maxPoints) {
                maxPoints = scores[i];
            }
        }
        
        // Return the maximum points
        return maxPoints;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example test case
        int[] scores = {10, 20, 30, 20, 30, 10};
        System.out.println("Champion's Score: " + findChampion(scores)); // Output: 30
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the number of elements in the array. This is because we only perform a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(1) \), as we are using a constant amount of additional space regardless of the input size.
