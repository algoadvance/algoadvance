[Leetcode 1423. Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1423)
### Problem Statement
You have several cards arranged in a row, and each card has an associated number of points. The points are given in the integer array `cardPoints` where `cardPoints[i]` is the number of points associated with the `i-th` card.

In one step, you can take one card from the beginning or from the end of the row. You have to take exactly `k` cards.

Your goal is to maximize the total points you can obtain.

Given the integer array `cardPoints` and the integer `k`, return the maximum score you can obtain by taking exactly `k` cards.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: What are the constraints on the array `cardPoints` and the value of `k`?**
   - A: `1 <= cardPoints.length <= 10^5` and `1 <= cardPoints[i] <= 10^4`.
   - `1 <= k <= cardPoints.length`

2. **Q: Is taking cards from either end always optimal?**
   - A: Yes, exactly `k` cards need to be taken from the ends either from the beginning or from the end of the row.

### Strategy
We need to pick exactly `k` cards to maximize the sum of their points. If `k` is less than the length of the array, we can consider two possible scenarios:
1. Picking some cards from the start and the remaining from the end.
2. Picking all `k` cards either from the beginning or from the end.

However, instead of directly iterating over all possible combinations, we can use a sliding window approach.

**Sliding Window Approach:**
1. Compute the sum of the first `k` elements as an initial window sum.
2. Initialize `max_sum` to this initial window sum.
3. Slide the window by making space at the start and including one more element from the end sequentially.
4. For each slide, update the window sum and check if it yields a better maximum.

### Code
Here's the implementation of the above strategy in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxScore(int[] cardPoints, int k) {
        int n = cardPoints.length;
        // Calculate the sum of the first k cards
        int currentSum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            currentSum += cardPoints[i];
        }
        
        int maxSum = currentSum;
        
        // We will slide from the end towards the start, exchanging elements
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            // Remove the i-th element from the start and add the (n - i - 1)th element from the end
            currentSum = currentSum - cardPoints[k - 1 - i] + cardPoints[n - 1 - i];
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);
        }
        
        return maxSum;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization**: Calculating the sum of the first `k` elements takes \( O(k) \) time.
- **Sliding Window**: Adjusting the window by swapping each of the `k` elements from the start to the end also takes \( O(k) \) time.
- **Overall Time Complexity**: \( O(k) \).

This ensures that the solution is efficient even for the upper limit of the problem constraints.
