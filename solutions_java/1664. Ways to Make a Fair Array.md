[Leetcode 1664. Ways to Make a Fair Array full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1664)
## Problem Statement
Given an array `nums`, you are allowed to delete exactly one element from the array. After deleting the element, determine if there are more than one way to split the rest of the array into two non-empty parts such that their sums are equal. If so, return the count of such ways. Otherwise, return 0.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What should be the behavior if the numbers or the array length are edge cases, such as an array of length 1 or having large integers?
   - **A:** The array's length will always be greater than 1 since you have to consider the removal of one element to check for fair distribution.
  
2. **Q:** Are there any specific constraints on time complexity or space complexity?
   - **A:** The goal is to find an optimal solution. No explicit constraints have been mentioned, but aiming for O(n) time complexity is generally ideal for efficiency.

3. **Q:** Should negative numbers in the array be handled specifically?
   - **A:** The problem should handle negative numbers naturally unless otherwise specified.
   
## Strategy
1. **Prefix Sums:** Calculate the prefix sums for both odd and even indexed elements in the array.
   
2. **Total Sums:** Compute the total sums of the elements at odd and even indices.
   
3. **On Deletion Calculation:** As you iterate through the array, simulate the effect of removing each element. After removal, check if the sum of odd and even indexed elements are equal.
   
4. **Count Ways:** Count the number of valid ways that lead to fair arrays.

## Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int waysToMakeFair(int[] nums) {
        int length = nums.length;
        
        // Arrays to store prefix sums
        int[] prefixEven = new int[length + 1];
        int[] prefixOdd = new int[length + 1];
        
        // Fill prefix sums arrays
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            prefixEven[i + 1] = prefixEven[i];
            prefixOdd[i + 1] = prefixOdd[i];
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                prefixEven[i + 1] += nums[i];
            } else {
                prefixOdd[i + 1] += nums[i];
            }
        }
        
        int totalEven = prefixEven[length];
        int totalOdd = prefixOdd[length];
        
        int ways = 0;
        
        // Iterate through the array to check for each removal possibility
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            int sumEvenWithoutI = prefixEven[i] + (totalOdd - prefixOdd[i + 1]);
            int sumOddWithoutI = prefixOdd[i] + (totalEven - prefixEven[i + 1]);
            
            if (sumEvenWithoutI == sumOddWithoutI) {
                ways++;
            }
        }
        
        return ways;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. This is because the solution involves calculating prefix sums in one pass and then iterating through the array once more to evaluate each condition. The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage of the prefix sums arrays.
