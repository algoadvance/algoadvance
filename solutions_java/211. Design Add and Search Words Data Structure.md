[Leetcode 211. Design Add and Search Words Data Structure](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l211)
### Problem Statement

You need to design a data structure for adding and searching words efficiently. The data structure should support the following two operations:

1. `void addWord(String word)`: Adds a word into the data structure.
2. `boolean search(String word)`: Returns `true` if the word is in the data structure. A word could contain the dot character `'.'` to represent any one letter.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** How large can the words be?
   - **A:** The length of each word is in the range [1, 500].

2. **Q:** How many words can we add to the data structure?
   - **A:** You can assume the number of words added will not exceed 3 * 10^4.

3. **Q:** Can the dot character `'.'` appear multiple times in a single search query?
   - **A:** Yes, the `'.'` character can appear multiple times and at any positions within the search query.

4. **Q:** Should the search operation support case sensitivity?
   - **A:** For simplicity, assume all input words are lowercase.

### Strategy

We will use a Trie (prefix tree) data structure. This will help us efficiently store and search words with support for the dot character `'.'`.

- **Adding a Word:** 
  - We will insert each word character by character into the Trie. Each node in the Trie will represent a character of a word.
  - Mark the end of the word with a boolean flag.

- **Searching a Word:**
  - Implement a recursive depth-first search (DFS) to handle the dot character. The dot character indicates that we must check all possible characters at that position.
  - For normal characters, simply follow the Trie branch.

### Code

Here's how you can implement the data structure in Java:

```java
class WordDictionary {

    private class TrieNode {
        public TrieNode[] children;
        public boolean isWord;

        public TrieNode() {
            this.children = new TrieNode[26]; // for 26 lowercase English letters
            this.isWord = false;
        }
    }
    
    private TrieNode root;

    public WordDictionary() {
        this.root = new TrieNode();
    }
    
    public void addWord(String word) {
        TrieNode node = root;
        for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
            int index = c - 'a';
            if (node.children[index] == null) {
                node.children[index] = new TrieNode();
            }
            node = node.children[index];
        }
        node.isWord = true; // mark the end of a word
    }
    
    public boolean search(String word) {
        return searchInNode(word, root, 0);
    }

    private boolean searchInNode(String word, TrieNode node, int start) {
        TrieNode current = node;
        for (int i = start; i < word.length(); i++) {
            char c = word.charAt(i);
            if (c == '.') {
                // Check all possible children nodes
                for (TrieNode child : current.children) {
                    if (child != null && searchInNode(word, child, i + 1)) {
                        return true;
                    }
                }
                return false; // if no path matched
            } else {
                int index = c - 'a';
                if (current.children[index] == null) {
                    return false;
                }
                current = current.children[index];
            }
        }
        return current.isWord;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **addWord(String word)**:
  - **Time complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of the word. This is because we iterate over each character of the word once and perform constant time operations.
  
- **search(String word)**:
  - **Time complexity:** In the worst case, it can be O(26^m * n) where m is the length of the word and n is the number of characters processed. The worst case occurs because each `'.'` character requires checking all 26 possible children nodes.
