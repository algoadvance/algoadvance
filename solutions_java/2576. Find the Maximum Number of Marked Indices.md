[Leetcode 2576. Find the Maximum Number of Marked Indices](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2576)
## Problem Statement
You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. Initially, all of the indices are unmarked. You are allowed to make this operation any number of times:

- Pick two **different** unmarked indices `i` and `j` such that `2 * nums[i] <= nums[j]`, then mark `i` and `j`.

Return the maximum possible number of marked indices in `nums` using the above operation any number of times.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can we assume the array contains only positive integers?**
   Yes, let's assume `nums` contains only positive integers unless otherwise specified.

2. **What should be returned if no indices can be marked?**
   If no indices can be marked, the output should be `0`.

3. **Is the array size constrained within a certain range?**
   Typically, the constraints within LeetCode are manageable in the sense for sorting algorithms to complete in polynomial time. Assume the array size could be large but within reasonable computational limits.

## Strategy
1. **Sorting:**
   First, we sort the array. Sorting helps us to easily find pairs where `2 * nums[i] <= nums[j]`.

2. **Two-pointer technique:**
   We then use a two-pointer technique to find the indices that can be paired according to the given condition.

3. **Pairing mechanism:**
   - Start by setting one pointer at the beginning (`i = 0`) and another one at the middle of the array (`j = n/2`).
   - Try to find the first pair starting from these two positions.
   - Mark indices when a valid pair is found and move the pointers appropriately.

4. **Counting marked pairs:**
   For every valid pair found, we increase the count of marked indices by `2`.

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting the array** will take `O(n log n)`.
- The **two-pointer approach** for finding the pairs will run in `O(n)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step.

## Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int maxNumOfMarkedIndices(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int n = nums.length;
        int count = 0;
        int i = 0, j = n / 2;

        while (i < n / 2 && j < n) {
            // Look for pairs using the two-pointer method
            if (2 * nums[i] <= nums[j]) {
                // Valid pair found: mark i and j
                count += 2;
                i++;
                j++;
            } else {
                // Try the next larger nums[j]
                j++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```

This code snippet follows the described strategy:
1. **Sorts** the array.
2. Utilizes the **two-pointer technique** to find and count valid pairs.
3. Returns the maximum number of marked indices.
