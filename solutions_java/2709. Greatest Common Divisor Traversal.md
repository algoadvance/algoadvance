[Leetcode 2709. Greatest Common Divisor Traversal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2709)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of positive integers `nums`, you need to check if you can traverse the array from the first element to the last element by following these traversal rules:
1. You start at the first element.
2. From any element, you can only move to an element that has a greatest common divisor (GCD) greater than 1 with the current element.

Return `true` if you can traverse from the first element to the last element following these rules, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the array have duplicate elements?
   - Yes, the array can have duplicate elements.
2. What should be the behavior if the array consists of only one element?
   - If the array has only one element, then traversal is trivially possible, so return `true`.
3. What is the size range of the `nums` array?
   - Typically, constraints are not provided in the problem statement, but let's assume `n` (the number of elements in `nums`) is within the range `[1, 10^4]`.

### Strategy
1. To determine whether we can traverse from the first element to the last one, we need to explore all possible paths using Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).
2. We will use an adjacency list graph representation where each node (index of the array) points to other nodes which have a GCD greater than 1 with it.
3. Once the graph is built, we can perform a BFS or DFS starting from the first element to check if we can reach the last element.

### Code
Below is the solution using BFS:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public boolean canTraverse(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        if (n == 1) return true; // Single element array
        
        // Create a graph where graph[i] contains indices of elements that have GCD > 1 with nums[i]
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (gcd(nums[i], nums[j]) > 1) {
                    graph.get(i).add(j);
                    graph.get(j).add(i);
                }
            }
        }

        // BFS to check if we can reach the last element
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(0);
        visited[0] = true;
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int node = queue.poll();
            if (node == n - 1) return true; // Reach the last element
            
            for (int neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
                if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                    visited[neighbor] = true;
                    queue.add(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return false; // If we exit the loop without reaching the last element
    }

    private int gcd(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            int temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }

    // For testing the function
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums1 = {2, 3, 6, 3, 4};
        int[] nums2 = {2, 4, 8, 2, 6};
        
        System.out.println(sol.canTraverse(nums1)); // true
        System.out.println(sol.canTraverse(nums2)); // true
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Building the graph takes O(n^2) steps, where each pair of elements is considered once.
- The BFS traversal takes O(n + E), where `E` is the number of edges. In the worst case, `E` could be O(n^2).
- Overall, the time complexity is O(n^2).

### Space Complexity
- The adjacency list representation of the graph uses O(n^2) space in the worst case.
- Additional space is used for the visited array and queue, making the total space complexity O(n^2).
