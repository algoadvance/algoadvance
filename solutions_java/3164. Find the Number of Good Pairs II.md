[Leetcode 3164. Find the Number of Good Pairs II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3164)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of integers. A pair `(i, j)` is called good if `nums[i] == nums[j]` and `i < j`.

Your task is to find the number of good pairs in the input array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the range of the length of the array?
    - What are the possible values of the integers in the array?
    - Are there any constraints on the input size for optimization?

2. **Output**:
    - Should we return or print the number of good pairs?
    - Is the result expected to be an integer?

3. **Special Cases**:
    - How should we handle an array with no duplicate elements?
    - What if the array is empty or has only one element?

### Strategy
1. **Understanding the Problem**:
    - To find pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j` and `nums[i] == nums[j]`, we can think of a combination problem.
    - We can count the occurrences of each number and then compute the number of valid pairs from the count.

2. **Approach**:
    - Use a HashMap to store the frequency of each number.
    - Iterate through the array and update the frequency count in the HashMap.
    - For each number, if it appears `count` times, the number of ways to pick pairs `(i, j)` is influenced by combinatorial selection: `count * (count - 1) / 2`.

3. **Algorithm Steps**:
    1. Initialize a HashMap to keep track of the frequency count.
    2. Traverse the array and populate the HashMap with the frequency of each element.
    3. Calculate the number of good pairs using the values in the HashMap.

### Code
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    public int numIdenticalPairs(int[] nums) {
        // HashMap to store frequency of each number
        Map<Integer, Integer> countMap = new HashMap<>();
        int goodPairs = 0;

        // Traverse through the nums array
        for (int num : nums) {
            // If the number is already in the map, increment the count of good pairs by the current count of num
            if (countMap.containsKey(num)) {
                goodPairs += countMap.get(num);
            }
            // Update the frequency of num in the map
            countMap.put(num, countMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }

        return goodPairs;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3, 3}; // example input
        System.out.println(solution.numIdenticalPairs(nums)); // expected output: 4
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is **O(n)** where `n` is the number of elements in the input array `nums`. This is because we traverse the array once and perform constant-time operations for each element.
- The space complexity is **O(n)** as well, due to the space required by the HashMap to store the frequency of each element in the array.
