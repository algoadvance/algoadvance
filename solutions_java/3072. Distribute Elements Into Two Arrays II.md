[Leetcode 3072. Distribute Elements Into Two Arrays II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3072)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. Distribute the elements of `nums` into two arrays `arr1` and `arr2` such that:

1. The number of elements in `arr1` is exactly `k`.
2. The sum of the elements in `arr1` is minimized.
3. The sum of the elements in `arr2` is maximized.

Return the minimum possible sum of `arr1` and the maximum possible sum of `arr2`.

**Example:**

```java
Nums: [1, 3, 2, 4, 7, 5]
k: 2
Minimum possible sum of arr1: 3 (Possible arr1: [1, 2])
Maximum possible sum of arr2: 19 (Possible arr2: [3, 4, 5, 7])
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- `1 <= k`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Unique Elements**: Are the elements in `nums` unique or can there be duplicates?
    - The elements can have duplicates.
  
2. **Range of k**: Can k be greater than nums.length or less than 1?
    - No, `k` will always be within the range `1 <= k <= nums.length`.

3. **Ordering of Elements**: Do we need to maintain the order in the resulting arrays?
    - No, the order does not need to be maintained. We are only concerned with the sums.

## Strategy

To achieve the desired results, we need to focus on these key points:

1. **Minimize Sum of `arr1`**: To minimize the sum, select the smallest `k` elements from `nums`.
2. **Maximize Sum of `arr2`**: To maximize the sum of the remaining elements after selecting `k` elements, the rest should be the largest elements in the array excluding those chosen for `arr1`.

**Steps:**

1. **Sort the `nums` array**:
   - Sorted ascendingly.
   
2. **Select the first `k` smallest elements** for `arr1`.

3. **The rest of the elements** automatically form `arr2`.

## Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class DistributeElements {

    public static int[] distribute(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Sort the array to easily pick the k smallest elements
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        
        // Calculate the sum of the smallest k elements
        int minSumArr1 = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            minSumArr1 += nums[i];
        }

        // Calculate the sum of the remaining elements
        int maxSumArr2 = 0;
        for (int i = k; i < nums.length; i++) {
            maxSumArr2 += nums[i];
        }

        // Return the result as an array
        return new int[]{minSumArr1, maxSumArr2};
    }

    // Example usage
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {1, 3, 2, 4, 7, 5};
        int k = 2;
        int[] result = distribute(nums, k);
        System.out.println("Minimum possible sum of arr1: " + result[0]);
        System.out.println("Maximum possible sum of arr2: " + result[1]);
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: The sorting step takes `O(n log n)` time, where `n` is the length of the array.
- **Summing elements**: Summing the first `k` elements and the remaining `n - k` elements takes `O(n)`.

Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which brings us to `O(n log n)`.

## Space Complexity

- The space complexity is `O(1)` if we disregard the space required for sorting. Sorting typically requires `O(n)` extra space for in-place sorting algorithms like merge sort. However, using a heap-based sorting like quicksort (dependent on implementation) can achieve `O(log n)` auxiliary space.

Thus, the solution is efficient and follows expected complexity constraints for large inputs.
