[Leetcode 782. Transform to Chessboard](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l782)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `n x n` binary grid that represents a binary matrix of `0`s and `1`s. We want to transform this matrix into a "chessboard matrix", where no two 1's or 0's that are 2x2 adjacent blocks form a square. That means no two 1's or 0's can appear next to each other horizontally or vertically.

Specifically, a matrix where the pattern rotates between 0 and 1 in each cell (like a chessboard) is needed. 
A chessboard matrix looks like this:

For even n:
```
0 1 0 1 
1 0 1 0 
0 1 0 1 
1 0 1 0
```

For odd n:
```
0 1 0
1 0 1
0 1 0
```

Your task is to find the minimum number of moves required to transform the given grid into a chessboard matrix. A single move consists of swapping any two rows or any two columns.

Return the minimum number of swaps to transform the board. If the transformation is not possible, return -1.

### Example

```
Input: [[0, 1, 0],
        [1, 0, 1],
        [0, 1, 0]]
Output: 0

Input: [[1, 0, 0],
        [1, 1, 0],
        [0, 1, 0]]
Output: -1
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the size of the binary grid n?
2. Can n be any size?
3. Are there any constraints on the values in the grid?
4. Are we allowed to use in-built libraries for row and column swapping?

## Strategy

1. **Check Validity**:
   - Check whether transforming the matrix to a chessboard is even possible by analyzing row and column patterns.

2. **Identify Target Patterns**:
   - The transformed chessboard has two possible target patterns:
     - ``pattern1 = [[0, 1], [1, 0]]`` (for even n)
     - ``pattern2 = [[1, 0], [0, 1]]`` (for even n)
   - For odd `n`, the patterns are the same but with an extra row/column.

3. **Calculate Swaps**:
   - Count the number of swaps required to match rows and columns to both patterns.
   - The minimum of these counts will be our answer.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If n = 1, always 0 swaps if valid.
   - If n is large, handle efficiently using count comparison.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int movesToChessboard(int[][] board) {
        int n = board.length;
        
        // Check all row and column patterns
        int[] rowP = new int[n], colP = new int[n];
        
        // recording the row patterns in rowP and column patterns in colP
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                rowP[i] |= board[0][j] << j;
                colP[i] |= board[j][0] << j;
            }
        }
        
        int rowMask = (1 << n) - 1, colMask = (1 << n) - 1, rowCnt = 0, colCnt = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (rowP[i] != rowMask && rowP[i] != ~rowMask && colP[i] != colMask && colP[i] != ~colMask) {
                return -1; // invalid pattern
            }
            
            // Counting set bits
            rowCnt += Integer.bitCount(rowP[i]);
            colCnt += Integer.bitCount(colP[i]);
        }
        
        // Ensure the grid is properly formatted with alternating patterns
        if (Math.abs(rowCnt - n / 2) > 1 || Math.abs(colCnt - n / 2) > 1) {
            return -1;
        }

        int rowSwaps = countSwaps(rowP, rowMask, n);
        int colSwaps = countSwaps(colP, colMask, n);
        
        if (rowSwaps == -1 || colSwaps == -1) return -1;
        
        return rowSwaps / 2 + colSwaps / 2;
    }
    
    private int countSwaps(int[] pattern, int mask, int n) {
        int swaps = 0, defaultPattern = 0, reversePattern = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 2) {
            defaultPattern |= mask << i;
        }
        
        reversePattern = ~defaultPattern & ((1 << n) - 1);
        
        if (defaultPattern == pattern[0] || reversePattern == pattern[0]) {
            return Integer.bitCount(defaultPattern ^ pattern[0]);
        } else {
            return -1;
        }
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is as follows:

- **O(n^2)** for parsing the input grid and checking patterns.
- **O(n)** for calculating swaps and counts.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n^2)**.
