[Leetcode 1828. Queries on Number of Points Inside a Circle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1828)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` is the coordinate of a point on a 2D plane. Multiple points can have the same coordinate. You are also given an array `queries` where `queries[j] = [xj, yj, rj]` describes a circle centered at (xj, yj) with a radius of rj.

For each query query, compute the number of points inside the corresponding circle. Points on the boundary of the circle are also considered inside.

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[j]` is the answer to the `jth` query.

**Example:**
```
Input: points = [[1,3],[3,3],[5,3],[2,2]], queries = [[2,3,1],[4,3,1],[1,1,2]]
Output: [3,2,2]
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= points.length <= 500`
- `1 <= queries.length <= 500`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `queries[j].length == 3`
- `0 <= xi, yi, xj, yj <= 500`
- `1 <= rj <= 500`
- All `points` are unique

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the points guaranteed to be integers?
2. Are the coordinates non-negative as indicated in the constraints?
3. Should the result be computed considering both the points inside and on the boundary of the circle?

Given the constraints and requirements, let's devise a strategy and solution.

### Strategy
1. Loop through each query.
2. For each query, loop through each point to check whether it is inside or on the border of the circle defined by the query.
3. Use the Euclidean distance formula to determine if the point is within the circle:
   - Distance check: `((xi - xj)^2 + (yi - yj)^2) <= rj^2`
4. Count the number of points that satisfy this condition for each query.
5. Store the counts in the `answer` list and return it at the end.

### Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class Solution {
    public int[] countPoints(int[][] points, int[][] queries) {
        int[] answer = new int[queries.length];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < queries.length; i++) {
            int xj = queries[i][0];
            int yj = queries[i][1];
            int rj = queries[i][2];
            int count = 0;
            
            for (int[] point : points) {
                int xi = point[0];
                int yi = point[1];
                
                if ((xi - xj) * (xi - xj) + (yi - yj) * (yi - yj) <= rj * rj) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            
            answer[i] = count;
        }
        
        return answer;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Given that there are `m` queries and `n` points:
  - For each query, we check each point leading to a time complexity of O(m * n).
- Since both m and n can be as large as 500, the worst-case scenario involves 250,000 operations which are manageable in typical competitive programming constraints.

### Additional Notes
- This solution directly computes the distances without involving square roots to maintain integer-only operations for simplicity and efficiency.
- Ensure integer overflow doesn't occur, but given the constraints, it should not be an issue in Java since the squared distances of 500 are still within safe range.
