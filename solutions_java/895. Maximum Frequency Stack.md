[Leetcode 895. Maximum Frequency Stack](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l895)
### Problem Statement

You are required to implement `FreqStack`, a stack-like data structure that supports the following operations:

- `FreqStack()` constructs an empty frequency stack.
- `void push(int val)` pushes an integer `val` onto the stack.
- `int pop()` removes and returns the most frequent element in the stack. If there is a tie for the most frequent element, the element closest to the top of the stack is removed and returned.

**Example:**
```
Input:
["FreqStack","push","push","push","push","push","push","pop","pop","pop","pop"]
[[],[5],[7],[5],[7],[4],[5],[],[],[],[]]
Output:
[null,null,null,null,null,null,null,5,7,5,4]

Explanation:
FreqStack freqStack = new FreqStack();
freqStack.push(5); // The stack is [5]
freqStack.push(7); // The stack is [5,7]
freqStack.push(5); // The stack is [5,7,5]
freqStack.push(7); // The stack is [5,7,5,7]
freqStack.push(4); // The stack is [5,7,5,7,4]
freqStack.push(5); // The stack is [5,7,5,7,4,5]
freqStack.pop(); // return 5, as 5 is the most frequent. The stack becomes [5,7,5,7,4]
freqStack.pop(); // return 7, as 7 and 5 are the most frequent, but 7 is closest to the top. The stack becomes [5,7,5,4]
freqStack.pop(); // return 5, as 5 is the most frequent. The stack becomes [5,7,4]
freqStack.pop(); // return 4, as 4, 5 and 7 are the most frequent, but 4 is closest to the top. The stack becomes [5,7]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input values be negative?**
   - Yes, the problem statement does not restrict input values to be non-negative.
  
2. **What is the range of values and the number of operations?**
   - You may assume that the number of operations will be in the range `[1, 10000]` and the values will be in the range `[-10^9, 10^9]`.

3. **Do we need to handle edge cases like an empty stack during a pop operation?**
   - Since the problem description and example only deal with valid operations, you can assume that the sequence of operations will always be valid.

### Strategy

1. **Frequency Counter:** Use a `HashMap` to keep track of the frequency of each element.
2. **Group Stack:** Use another `HashMap` where the key is the frequency and the value is a stack (or list) that contains elements with that frequency.
3. **Max Frequency:** Track the maximum frequency present in the stack.
4. **Push Operation:**
   - Increase the frequency of the element.
   - Push the element onto the stack corresponding to its frequency.
   - Update the maximum frequency if necessary.
5. **Pop Operation:**
   - Retrieve the element from the stack corresponding to the current maximum frequency.
   - Decrease the frequency and remove the element from the frequency stack.
   - If the frequency stack becomes empty, decrease the maximum frequency.

### Code Implementation

```java
import java.util.*;

class FreqStack {
    // Frequency map to count the frequency of each element
    private Map<Integer, Integer> freqMap;
    // Group stack to group elements by their frequencies
    private Map<Integer, Stack<Integer>> groupStack;
    // Track the maximum frequency
    private int maxFreq;

    public FreqStack() {
        freqMap = new HashMap<>();
        groupStack = new HashMap<>();
        maxFreq = 0;
    }

    public void push(int val) {
        // Get the current frequency of val, increment it and update the map
        int freq = freqMap.getOrDefault(val, 0) + 1;
        freqMap.put(val, freq);
        // Update maxFreq if this element's frequency exceeds the current maxFreq
        if (freq > maxFreq) {
            maxFreq = freq;
        }
        // Push the element onto the stack corresponding to its frequency
        groupStack.computeIfAbsent(freq, k -> new Stack<>()).push(val);
    }

    public int pop() {
        // Get the stack of elements with the current max frequency
        Stack<Integer> stack = groupStack.get(maxFreq);
        int val = stack.pop();
        // Decrease the frequency of this element
        if (stack.isEmpty()) {
            groupStack.remove(maxFreq);
            maxFreq--;
        }
        freqMap.put(val, freqMap.get(val) - 1);
        if (freqMap.get(val) == 0) {
            freqMap.remove(val);
        }
        return val;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **push(val):** O(1) - Adding the element and modifying the data structures take constant time.
- **pop():** O(1) - Retrieving and updating the data structures take constant time.

The implementation efficiently handles the required operations in constant time, making it suitable for the problem constraints.
