[Leetcode 2344. Minimum Deletions to Make Array Divisible](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2344)
### Problem Statement

Given two arrays `nums` and `numsDivide` of positive integers, you can delete any number of elements from `nums`. Return the minimum number of deletions required such that the smallest element in the remaining `nums` divides all the elements of `numsDivide`. If it's not possible, return -1.

### Example

```java
Input: nums = [3, 2, 6, 2, 35, 5, 2], numsDivide = [6, 9, 12]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
- Start with nums = [3, 2, 6, 2, 35, 5, 2]
- Remove the elements 3, 35, and 5.
- Now the smallest element is 2, which divides all the elements of numsDivide: [6, 9, 12]
- The number of deletions needed is 2.

Input: nums = [4], numsDivide = [2,8]
Output: 0
Explanation: The smallest element is 4, which divides all the elements of numsDivide.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size range of the input arrays?**
   - Typical constraint sizes for competitive programming are `1 <= nums.length, numsDivide.length <= 10^5`.

2. **What is the range of the elements within the arrays?**
   - Elements are positive integers, typically in the range `1 <= nums[i], numsDivide[i] <= 10^9`.

3. **Do the elements need to be removed in place, or can we use additional space to store interim results?**
   - You are free to use additional space for storing interim results if needed.

### Strategy

1. **Calculate the GCD of numsDivide:**
   - To check if an element in `nums` can divide all elements in `numsDivide`, it must divide the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) of `numsDivide`.
   
2. **Sort `nums`:**
   - Sorting helps to easily find the smallest possible element that can divide the GCD and count the number of deletions needed.

3. **Check divisibility:**
   - Traverse the sorted `nums` and find the first element that divides the GCD of `numsDivide`.

4. **Count deletions:**
   - The position of the first valid divisor in the sorted array will give the number of deletions needed.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int minDeletions(int[] nums, int[] numsDivide) {
        // Calculate the GCD of all elements in numsDivide
        int gcd = numsDivide[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < numsDivide.length; i++) {
            gcd = gcd(gcd, numsDivide[i]);
        }

        // Sort nums array
        Arrays.sort(nums);

        // Traverse the sorted nums array and find the minimum deletions
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (gcd % nums[i] == 0) {
                return i; // Number of deletions required
            }
        }

        // If no valid element found, return -1
        return -1;
    }

    // Helper method to calculate GCD of two numbers
    private int gcd(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            int temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {3, 2, 6, 2, 35, 5, 2};
        int[] numsDivide = {6, 9, 12};
        System.out.println(solution.minDeletions(nums, numsDivide)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **GCD Calculation:**
   - The time complexity to calculate the GCD of `numsDivide` array is `O(n)` where `n` is the length of `numsDivide`.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The time complexity to sort the `nums` array is `O(m log m)` where `m` is the length of `nums`.

3. **Traversal and Check:**
   - The time complexity for traversing `nums` and checking divisibility is `O(m)`.

Combining these, the overall time complexity is:
- **Overall Time Complexity:** `O(n) + O(m log m) + O(m)` => `O(m log m)`, assuming the length of `nums` (m) is larger than `numsDivide` (n).

This solution efficiently finds the minimum number of deletions needed to achieve the goal.
