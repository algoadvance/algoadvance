[Leetcode 1390. Four Divisors](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1390)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return the sum of divisors of the integers in that array that have exactly four divisors. If there is no such integer in the array, return 0.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What constitutes a divisor?**
   - A divisor of a number `n` is an integer `d` such that `n % d == 0`.

2. **What are the constraints on the input array `nums`?**
   - The constraints are not specified here, but you can expect standard constraints like `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4` and `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`.
   
3. **What should we return if no numbers have exactly four divisors?**
   - If no numbers in the array have exactly four divisors, we should return 0.

## Strategy

Given the problem, the strategy involves:
1. Identifying numbers in the array that have exactly four divisors.
2. Summing the divisors of these numbers.

### Steps:
1. **Check Each Number:** For each number in the input array, check if it has exactly four divisors.
2. **Divisors Identification:** Use a loop to iterate from 1 to the square root of the number to find its divisors.
3. **Count Divisors:** Keep a count of the divisors and store them if the count is 4.
4. **Sum and Store:** If a number has exactly four divisors, add the divisors and include in the result.
5. **Return Result:** Finally, return the sum of all such divisors.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class FourDivisors {
    public int sumFourDivisors(int[] nums) {
        int totalSum = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            List<Integer> divisors = findDivisors(num);
            if (divisors.size() == 4) {
                int sum = 0;
                for (int divisor : divisors) {
                    sum += divisor;
                }
                totalSum += sum;
            }
        }
        
        return totalSum;
    }
    
    private List<Integer> findDivisors(int num) {
        List<Integer> divisors = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) {
            if (num % i == 0) {
                divisors.add(i);
                if (i != num / i) {
                    divisors.add(num / i);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return divisors;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FourDivisors fd = new FourDivisors();
        int[] nums = {21, 4, 7, 28};
        System.out.println(fd.sumFourDivisors(nums)); // Output should be 32 (because 21 has divisors 1, 3, 7, 21 and their sum is 32)
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Finding Divisors:** For each number, finding divisors involves iterating up to the square root of the number, which leads to a time complexity of `O(sqrt(n))` per element.
2. **Total Time Complexity:** Given that we perform the divisor check for each element of the array, the total time complexity is `O(m * sqrt(n))` where `m` is the length of the array and `n` is the maximum value in the array.

In conclusion, this approach is manageable within typical constraints and should perform efficiently for the given problem within reasonable limits.
