[Leetcode 2322. Minimum Score After Removals on a Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2322)
## Problem Statement
Given a tree (an undirected acyclic connected graph) consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n-1`, the tree is rooted at node `0`. Each node has a score associated with it which is given by an array `score` of length `n`. The score of a node `i` is defined as the bitwise XOR of all the nodes in the subtree of `i` (including `i` itself).

You need to remove two edges in the tree such that the tree is split into three connected components. Let the scores of each of the three components be `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively. The value you are looking to minimize is the maximum of `a`, `b`, and `c`.

Your task is to return this minimum possible value.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the range of `n` (the number of nodes)?
    - What are the possible values for each element in the `score` array?

2. **Can we assume that the input always forms a valid tree structure (connected and acyclic)?**

3. **Any specifics about the inputs, such as edge cases with very small trees (e.g., n = 3)?**

**Assumptions based on typical constraints**:
- `1 <= n <= 10^4`
- `0 <= score[i] <= 10^9`
- Yes, we assume the input always forms a valid tree.

## Strategy
1. **DFS Traversal**:
    - We'll perform a DFS traversal to compute the XOR for each subtree rooted at every node.

2. **Edge Removal Simulation**:
    - We need to consider removing every possible pair of edges to explore all ways to split the tree into three components.

3. **Score Computation**:
    - For each pair of edges removed, calculate the scores of the resulting three components and keep track of the minimum of the maximum scores.

4. **Optimization**:
    - Use a recursive approach to avoid recomputation and keep track of subtree scores.

## Code
```java
import java.util.*;

public class MinimumScoreAfterRemovals {
    int[] scores;
    List<Integer>[] tree;
    int[][] dp;
    
    private void dfs(int node, int parent) {
        dp[node][0] = scores[node]; // Initial score of the node itself
        for (int child : tree[node]) {
            if (child != parent) {
                dfs(child, node);
                dp[node][0] ^= dp[child][0]; // Aggregate XOR from the child subtree
            }
        }
    }
    
    private int computeScore(int n) {
        // This array will hold the component scores after considering removing edges
        int[] components = new int[3];
        int minMaxScore = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        // We will explore different pairs of edges to remove
        for (int i = 0; i < tree.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < tree[i].size(); j++) {
                for (int k = j + 1; k < tree[i].size(); k++) {
                    int child1 = tree[i].get(j);
                    int child2 = tree[i].get(k);
                        
                    components[0] = dp[child1][0];
                    components[1] = dp[child2][0];
                    components[2] = dp[0][0] ^ dp[child1][0] ^ dp[child2][0];
                    
                    int maximumScore = Math.max(components[0], Math.max(components[1], components[2]));
                    minMaxScore = Math.min(minMaxScore, maximumScore);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return minMaxScore;
    }
    
    public int minimumScore(int[] scoresInput, int[][] edges) {
        int n = scoresInput.length;
        scores = scoresInput;
        tree = new ArrayList[n];
        dp = new int[n][1];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            tree[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            tree[edge[0]].add(edge[1]);
            tree[edge[1]].add(edge[0]);
        }
        
        // Step 1: Compute subtree scores using DFS
        dfs(0, -1);
        
        // Step 2: Compute minimal max score after edge removals
        return computeScore(n);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumScoreAfterRemovals solution = new MinimumScoreAfterRemovals();
        int[] scores = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int[][] edges = // use example above
        System.out.println(solution.minimumScore(scores, edges)); // Expected output: ...
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
1. **DFS Traversal**: `O(n)` for calculating the XOR for all subtrees.
2. **Edge Removal Simulation**: `O(n^2)` because we are considering pairs of edges, worst-case combinations.
3. **Overall Time Complexity**: `O(n^2)` which is feasible given the constraints.

This approach ensures we explore all possible ways to split the tree while keeping the computation efficient.
