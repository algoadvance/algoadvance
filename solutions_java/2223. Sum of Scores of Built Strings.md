[Leetcode 2223. Sum of Scores of Built Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2223)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` of length `n` consisting of digits ('0'-'9') and lowercase English letters ('a'-'z'). A string `t` is called a built string of `s` if `t` is a non-empty prefix of `s` or the entire string `s`. 

For every prefix of `s` of length `i` (1 ≤ i ≤ n), calculate the Z-function of that prefix. The Z-function for a string is an array of length `n` where the `i-th` element is the length of the longest substring starting from `i` that is also a prefix of the string. 

Your task is to return the sum of all `Z` values computed for all prefixes of `s`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the constraint on the length of the input string `s`?**
   - The problem statement does not specify this yet, but typically such constraints will be given in the actual problem description on the LeetCode platform.

2. **What should be the output for empty or single-character strings?**
   - The problem states that `t` has to be a non-empty prefix, so if the string `s` is empty, the sum would naturally be zero.

3. **Is there any specific character set restriction apart from digits and lowercase English letters?**
   - For this problem, the input string `s` is limited to digits ('0'-'9') and lowercase English letters ('a'-'z').

### Strategy
1. **Calculate Z-Function:** We need to compute the Z-function for each prefix of `s`. The Z-function for a string is computed such that `Z[i]` is the length of the longest substring starting from the `i-th` position that matches a prefix of the string.
  
2. **Iterate Over Prefixes:** For each prefix of `s` (from length 1 to `n`), calculate its Z-function and sum all the values in its Z-function array.
  
3. **Efficient Calculation:** Use the standard Z-function computation algorithm which runs in linear time `O(n)` to compute the Z array for each prefix efficiently.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public long sumScores(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        long totalSum = 0;

        // For each prefix of length i (i ranges from 1 to n)
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            String prefix = s.substring(0, i);
            int[] Z = calculateZ(prefix); // Calculate Z function for this prefix
            
            // Add all values in the Z array to the total sum
            for (int z_val : Z) {
                totalSum += z_val;
            }
        }
        return totalSum;
    }

    // Calculate the Z-function for a given string
    private int[] calculateZ(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[] Z = new int[n];
        int L = 0, R = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (i <= R) {
                Z[i] = Math.min(R - i + 1, Z[i - L]);
            }
            while (i + Z[i] < n && s.charAt(Z[i]) == s.charAt(i + Z[i])) {
                Z[i]++;
            }
            if (i + Z[i] - 1 > R) {
                L = i;
                R = i + Z[i] - 1;
            }
        }
        // Include the first character itself
        Z[0] = n; // Z[0] is the size of the entire string since the entire prefix matches itself
        return Z;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Z-Function Computation:** Calculating the Z-function for a single string of length `k` takes `O(k)` time.
- **Iterating Over Prefixes:** We compute the Z-function for prefixes of length 1 to `n`, this will result in a cumulative complexity of `O(1 + 2 + 3 + ... + n) = O(n*(n+1)/2) = O(n^2)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is `O(n^2)`.
