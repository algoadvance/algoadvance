[Leetcode 2801. Count Stepping Numbers in Range](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2801)
### Problem Statement

We are given two non-negative integers, `low` and `high`. A "stepping number" is defined as a number such that the absolute difference between every two consecutive digits is equal to 1. You are tasked with finding the count of all stepping numbers in the range `[low, high]` inclusive.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range Constraints**: What are the constraints on the values of `low` and `high`?
   - Typically, the constraints will be as follows: \(0 \leq low \leq high \leq 10^9\).
   
2. **Definition Precision**: Does a single-digit number qualify as a stepping number?
   - Yes, each single-digit number is considered a stepping number since it has no consecutive digits to compare.

3. **Output Requirements**: What is the expected output format?
   - Output a single integer, which is the count of stepping numbers in the given range `[low, high]`.

### Strategy

To find all stepping numbers in the range `[low, high]`, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach:

1. **Initial State**: Start BFS with all single-digit numbers (1-9). Note that we'll handle `0` separately if the range includes `0`.

2. **Expand State**: For each number, generate the next possible stepping numbers by appending a digit that is 1 greater or 1 less than the last digit of the current number.

3. **Validity Check**: Continue this process while each generated number is within the `high` limit.

4. **Range Check**: Count only those numbers that fall within `[low, high]`.

### Code

Here is the implementation of the above strategy in Java:

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public class SteppingNumbersCounter {
    
    public static int countSteppingNumbers(int low, int high) {
        // Edge case handling
        if (low > high) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        Queue<Long> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        
        // Initialize the queue with single-digit numbers
        for (long i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
            queue.offer(i);
        }
        
        // Handle zero separately if it's within the range
        if (low == 0) {
            count++;
        }
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            long current = queue.poll();
            
            if (current > high) continue;
            if (current >= low) count++;
            
            long lastDigit = current % 10;
            
            if (lastDigit > 0) {
                long stepDown = current * 10 + (lastDigit - 1);
                if (stepDown <= high) queue.offer(stepDown);
            }

            if (lastDigit < 9) {
                long stepUp = current * 10 + (lastDigit + 1);
                if (stepUp <= high) queue.offer(stepUp);
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage
        int low = 0;
        int high = 21;
        System.out.println(countSteppingNumbers(low, high)); // Output: 13
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is challenging to pin down exactly since it depends on the distribution of stepping numbers, but in general, each number can branch out into two new numbers.
  - Since we are generating numbers starting from single digits and moving towards the highest possible value within the range, the effective operations will be proportional to the number of stepping numbers up to `high`.
  
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity will be dominated by the size of the queue and potentially by the count of stepping numbers stored in the queue at any one time, which in the worst case, can reach up to a few times the size of the range divided by the number of steps. Considering we are using BFS, this should be manageable within the constraints.
