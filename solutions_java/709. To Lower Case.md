[Leetcode 709. To Lower Case](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l709)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, return the string after replacing every uppercase letter with the same lowercase letter.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the input string restricted to just alphabetic characters?**
   - No, the input string can contain any printable characters.
   
2. **Can the input string be empty?**
   - Yes, the input string can be empty, in which case the output should also be an empty string.
   
3. **Do we need to handle non-English alphabet characters?**
   - The problem typically deals with English alphabet characters only, but itâ€™s good practice to ensure the solution is robust for any UTF-8 characters.

4. **Are there any constraints on the length of the input string?**
   - No specific constraints, but typically it should be expected to handle reasonably large strings within the usual limits of the problem context.

### Strategy
Java provides built-in methods to convert a string to lowercase, making this problem straightforward to solve using the `toLowerCase` method of the `String` class.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public String toLowerCase(String s) {
        return s.toLowerCase();
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        // Test Cases
        System.out.println(solution.toLowerCase("Hello")); // Output: "hello"
        System.out.println(solution.toLowerCase("here")); // Output: "here"
        System.out.println(solution.toLowerCase("LOVELY")); // Output: "lovely"
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we must examine and possibly convert each character in the string.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the additional space required to store the resulting lowercase string.

Using the `toLowerCase` method leverages Java's highly optimized internal libraries for character conversion, providing a concise and efficient solution.
