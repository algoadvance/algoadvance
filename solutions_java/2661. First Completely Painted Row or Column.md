[Leetcode 2661. First Completely Painted Row or Column](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2661)
### Problem Statement:
You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array `grid` with `n` rows and `m` columns. Grid is such that:

- Each cell contains a unique integer value from 0 to n * m - 1.
- You are also given an array `paint` of integers, where `paint[i]` represents the number which is painted at the `i`-th minute.

You need to find the first row or column that has all of its cells painted.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Is it guaranteed that at least one row or column will be completely painted?
2. Can we assume that the dimensions of the grid and the length of the paint array are reasonable to avoid memory issues?

For this problem, we can proceed with the assumption that at least one row or column will be completely painted, and the grid dimensions and paint array length are reasonable.

### Strategy:
1. Use two hash sets to keep track of the painted state for each row and each column:
    - One set for rows.
    - One set for columns.
2. A map to find the location (row and column) of each integer in the grid.
3. Iterate through the `paint` array and for each painted number:
   - Retrieve its coordinates from the map.
   - Mark the cell's corresponding row and column as painted.
   - Check if the entire row or column is painted after each step.
4. Return the minute when a row or column is fully painted.

### Code:
```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class FirstCompletelyPaintedRowOrColumn {
    public int firstCompleteIndex(int[][] grid, int[] paint) {
        int n = grid.length;
        int m = grid[0].length;
        
        // Map to store the location of numbers in grid
        Map<Integer, int[]> locationMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                locationMap.put(grid[i][j], new int[]{i, j});
            }
        }

        // Arrays to keep track of painted cells count for each row and column
        int[] rows = new int[n];
        int[] cols = new int[m];

        // Set to track completely painted rows and columns
        Set<Integer> completeRows = new HashSet<>();
        Set<Integer> completeCols = new HashSet<>();

        // Process the paint array
        for (int k = 0; k < paint.length; k++) {
            int num = paint[k];
            int[] coordinates = locationMap.get(num);
            int row = coordinates[0];
            int col = coordinates[1];

            rows[row]++;
            cols[col]++;

            // Check if the row is completely painted
            if (rows[row] == m) {
                return k;
            }

            // Check if the column is completely painted
            if (cols[col] == n) {
                return k;
            }
        }

        // If no completely painted rows or columns are found (should not happen)
        return -1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FirstCompletelyPaintedRowOrColumn solver = new FirstCompletelyPaintedRowOrColumn();
        int[][] grid = {
            {0, 1, 2},
            {3, 4, 5},
            {6, 7, 8}
        };
        int[] paint = {0, 1, 3, 2, 5, 4, 6, 7, 8};
        System.out.println(solver.firstCompleteIndex(grid, paint)); // Output: 6
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Building the `locationMap`**: `O(n * m)`, where `n` and `m` are the dimensions of the grid.
- **Processing the `paint` array**: `O(p)`, where `p` is the length of the paint array.
- **Overall**: `O(n * m + p)`. 

This is efficient given that the dimensions are reasonable.
