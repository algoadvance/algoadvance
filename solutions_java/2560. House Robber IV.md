[Leetcode 2560. House Robber IV](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2560)
### Problem Statement

You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a line. Given a list of integer values `nums` representing the amount of money at each house, and an integer `k`, return the minimum capability of the robber to rob exactly `k` houses such that the maximum amount robbed in any house is minimized.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is there any restriction on which houses to rob (consecutive, non-consecutive)?**
   - The prompt does not specify this, so we assume that any `k` houses can be chosen.
   
2. **What is the range of `nums` and `k`?**
   - Generally, all elements in `nums` will be positive integers as they represent money.
   - `k` will be an integer such that `1 <= k <= nums.length`.

### Strategy

1. **Binary Search for Minimum Capability:**
   - Use binary search to find the minimum "capability" necessary to rob exactly `k` houses. This capability is defined as the amount of money in the house with the highest stash among the robbed houses.
   
2. **Auxiliary Function for Feasibility:**
   - Define a helper function `canRobWithCapability(cap)` which returns whether it is possible to rob `k` houses such that no house exceeds `cap` in terms of money. This involves treating `cap` as a threshold and checking if we can select `k` houses.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minCapability(int[] nums, int k) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = 0;
        
        // Find the maximum value in nums for the right boundary of binary search
        for (int num : nums) {
            right = Math.max(right, num);
        }
        
        // Binary search
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            
            if (canRobWithCapability(nums, k, mid)) {
                right = mid; // try for a smaller capability
            } else {
                left = mid + 1; // increase the capability
            }
        }
        
        return left; // or right, since left == right at the end of loop
    }
    
    private boolean canRobWithCapability(int[] nums, int k, int cap) {
        int count = 0;
        int i = 0;
        
        while (i < nums.length) {
            if (nums[i] <= cap) {
                count++; // choose this house
                if (count == k) {
                    return true; // found enough houses
                }
                i += 2; // skip one house to ensure no two chosen are adjacent
            } else {
                i++; // move to the next house
            }
        }
        
        return false; // not enough houses found
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search Loop:** `O(log(maxNum))` where `maxNum` is the maximum number in `nums`.
- **Each Feasibility Check:** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of `nums`.
- **Total Time Complexity:** `O(n * log(maxNum))`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently narrow down the minimum capability needed to rob exactly `k` houses such that the maximum amount in any robbed house is minimized.
