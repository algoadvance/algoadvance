[Leetcode 66. Plus One](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l66)
### Problem Statement
**LeetCode 66: Plus One**

Given a non-empty array of digits representing a non-negative integer, increment the integer by one. The digits are stored such that the most significant digit is at the head of the list, and each element in the array contains a single digit. You may assume the integer does not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: [1,2,3]
Output: [1,2,4]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 123.
```

```plaintext
Input: [4,3,2,1]
Output: [4,3,2,2]
Explanation: The array represents the integer 4321.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the input array be empty?
   **A:** No, the problem states that the array is non-empty.
   
2. **Q:** Should I consider edge cases like `[9, 9, 9]`?
   **A:** Yes, your solution should handle cases where there's a carry-over that impacts the most significant digit.

3. **Q:** Can the digits array contain negative values or values greater than 9?
   **A:** No, each element in the array represents a single digit from 0 to 9.

### Strategy
1. Start from the last digit of the array and move backwards.
2. Add 1 to the last element. If it becomes 10, set it to 0 and move to the next digit on the left, adding 1 to it.
3. Continue this process until there are no more carry-overs.
4. If after processing all digits a carry is left, insert `1` at the beginning of the array.
5. Return the modified array.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] plusOne(int[] digits) {
        int n = digits.length;
        
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (digits[i] < 9) {
                digits[i]++;
                return digits;
            }
            digits[i] = 0;
        }
        
        // If control comes here means digits were all 9's
        int[] result = new int[n + 1];
        result[0] = 1; // the most significant digit is 1
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the digits array. We may need to scan the entire array once in the worst-case scenario.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) for the input array in-place change, O(n) only if a new array is required (like in the case of all 9's).

This solution effectively handles the primary edge cases, including carry-over logic when all digits are 9.
