[Leetcode 2383. Minimum Hours of Training to Win a Competition](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2383)
### Problem Statement

You are participating in a competition in which you need to complete multiple rounds. You have an initial amount of experience and energy. To successfully complete each round, you need a certain amount of experience and energy.

Given the following:
1. Your initial experience and initial energy.
2. Arrays `experience` and `energy` where `experience[i]` and `energy[i]` are the experience and energy required to complete the ith round of the competition.

Your goal is to determine the minimum number of additional experience and energy hours you need to accumulate to win all rounds of the competition. Return the sum of the additional experience and energy hours required.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can initial experience or energy be zero?
   - **A:** Yes, initial experience or energy can be zero.
2. **Q:** Is there a specific order in which we must complete the rounds?
   - **A:** Yes, the rounds must be completed in the given order.
3. **Q:** Is it guaranteed that we can always train enough to win?
   - **A:** Yes, you can always train enough to win all rounds.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Conditions:** Start with the given `initialExperience` and `initialEnergy`.
2. **Iterate Through Rounds:** For each round:
   - Check if the current experience is sufficient. If not, calculate how much additional experience is needed and update the current experience.
   - Check if the current energy is sufficient. If not, calculate how much additional energy is needed and update the current energy.
   - After each round, deduct the required energy and add the required experience to the current stats.
3. **Update Minimum Training Hours**: Sum the required additional experience and energy training hours separately and return their total.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minNumberOfHours(int initialExperience, int initialEnergy, int[] experience, int[] energy) {
        int totalAddedExperience = 0;
        int totalAddedEnergy = 0;

        // Calculate the total energy required
        int totalEnergyRequired = 0;
        for (int e : energy) {
            totalEnergyRequired += e;
        }

        // Calculate the extra energy needed if any
        if (initialEnergy < totalEnergyRequired) {
            totalAddedEnergy = totalEnergyRequired - initialEnergy;
        }

        // Iterate through each round to calculate the extra experience needed
        int currentExperience = initialExperience;
        for (int i = 0; i < experience.length; i++) {
            if (currentExperience <= experience[i]) {
                totalAddedExperience += experience[i] - currentExperience + 1;
                currentExperience = experience[i] + 1;
            }
            currentExperience += experience[i];
        }

        return totalAddedEnergy + totalAddedExperience;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The solution involves iterating through the `experience` and `energy` arrays once. Therefore, the time complexity of this approach is \(O(n)\), where `n` is the length of the `experience` and `energy` arrays.

This solution efficiently calculates the required additional experience and energy in linear time, providing an optimal method for determining the total training hours needed to win the competition.
