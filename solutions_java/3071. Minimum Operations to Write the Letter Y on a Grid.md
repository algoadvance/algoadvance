[Leetcode 3071. Minimum Operations to Write the Letter Y on a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3071)
### Problem Statement

You are given a `m x n` grid. Initially, an empty string is positioned at the top-left corner (grid[0][0]). You can perform the following operations to write the letter "Y" on the grid:

1. Move to the right neighboring cell (row, col + 1).
2. Move to the bottom neighboring cell (row + 1, col).
3. Write a character 'Y' on the current cell.

You are asked to find the minimum number of operations needed to write the letter "Y" in every cell of the grid.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the grid dimensions?**
   This will help in deciding the length and breadth we need to work on.
   
2. **Are the moves restricted to right or down only?**
   Confirm the movement restrictions to accurately simulate the moves.

3. **Is the starting position always the top-left corner?**
   Confirming the starting position ensures the correct initialization point for counting operations.

4. **Does the initial grid contain any pre-written letters?**
   Knowing this will ensure we start with the correct grid state.

### Strategy

The key to solving this problem is recognizing that the number of operations in each cell is directly determined by the position of that cell in the grid (specifically focusing on the distance from the starting cell `[0][0]`). Each cell can fill itself with the letter 'Y' independently of other cells once reached by the traversal.

#### High-Level Steps:

1. Begin at the top-left corner.
2. Traverse the grid either moving right or down and fill each cell with 'Y'.
3. For each cell `(i, j)`, it requires `i + j + 1` operations to be reached and filled.
4. Sum up all the distances (operations) required to cover the whole grid.

### Code

Here's how you might implement this in Java:

```java
public class MinimumOperationsToWriteYOnGrid {

    public static int findMinimumOperations(int m, int n) {
        // Total minimum operations counter
        int operations = 0;
        
        // Calculate the number of operations needed for each cell
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                // Each cell (i, j) requires (i + j + 1) operations
                operations += i + j + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return operations;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Sample test case
        int m = 3;
        int n = 3;
        int result = findMinimumOperations(m, n);
        System.out.println("Minimum number of operations needed: " + result);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(m \times n)\) because we iterate through each cell exactly once to calculate the operations, where \(m\) is the number of rows and \(n\) is the number of columns.

### Complexity Analysis

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\)
  - The nested loops iterate over each cell in the grid, therefore the complexity is proportional to the total number of cells.
  
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
  - The space used is constant since we only use a few integer variables to store the result and loop counters.

This algorithm ensures we find the minimum operations efficiently given the constraints of the grid's dimensions.
