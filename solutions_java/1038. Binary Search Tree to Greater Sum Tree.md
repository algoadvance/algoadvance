[Leetcode 1038. Binary Search Tree to Greater Sum Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1038)
### Problem Statement

The problem is to convert a given Binary Search Tree (BST) to a Greater Sum Tree (GST). In a GST, every node's value is replaced with the sum of all values greater than or equal to the node's value in the original BST.

### Clarifying Questions

Before we begin, let's make sure we have clear understanding of the problem requirements:
1. **Tree Structure**: Is the tree provided well-formed, i.e., do all left child nodes have values less than their parent, and all right child nodes have values greater than their parent?
   - Yes, the tree will always be a correctly formed BST.
2. **Value Range**: Are there any constraints on the values contained in the nodes of the tree?
   - The node values can range freely within the integer limits.
3. **Output Format**: Do we need to modify the tree in place or return a new tree?
   - We should modify the tree in place.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to traverse the tree in a way that allows us to accumulate the sum of all nodes greater than the current node. The best strategy for this is a **reverse in-order traversal** (right -> node -> left):
1. Traverse the right subtree first because it contains nodes with greater values.
2. Visit the current node and update its value based on the accumulated sum.
3. Traverse the left subtree.

We will maintain a running sum that starts at 0 and accumulates the node values as we traverse. This ensures that by the time we visit each node, the running sum includes all greater node values.

### Code

```java
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

public class BSTToGST {
    private int sum = 0;

    public TreeNode bstToGst(TreeNode root) {
        traverse(root);
        return root;
    }

    private void traverse(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) return;
        
        // Traverse the right subtree first
        traverse(node.right);
        
        // Visit the current node
        sum += node.val;
        node.val = sum;
        
        // Traverse the left subtree
        traverse(node.left);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this traversal is **O(N)**, where **N** is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once during the traversal.

The space complexity is **O(H)**, which corresponds to the height of the tree. This space is used by the recursive call stack. In the worst case (unbalanced tree), the height could be **O(N)**, but for a balanced tree, the height is **O(log N)**.
