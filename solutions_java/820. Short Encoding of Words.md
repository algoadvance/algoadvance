[Leetcode 820. Short Encoding of Words](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l820)
## Problem Statement

Given a list of words, we want to encode them using the least number of characters. The encoding must be such that each word ends uniquely with a `"#"` character to delimit its end. A word can be part of another word's encoding. For example: "time", "me", "bell" can be encoded as "time#bell#", because "me" is a suffix of "time".

The goal is to determine the minimum length of the encoded string that contains all the given words as suffixes.

**Example:**
```
Input: words = ["time", "me", "bell"]
Output: 10
Explanation: "time#bell#" 
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can words contain duplicates in the input list?**
   - Yes, but duplicate words should be counted only once.

2. **Are there any constraints on the lengths of the words or the number of words?**
   - The length of each word is between `1` and `7`.
   - The total number of words will not exceed `2000`.

## Strategy

1. **Tries Data Structure**: Use a Trie (prefix tree) for efficiently identifying suffix relationships between words.
2. **Reverse Words**: Insert each word in the Trie in reversed order. This way, we can easily check if a word is a suffix of another.
3. **Identify Leaves**: After building the Trie, any leaf node that represents the end of an inserted word contributes to the encoding length. Each leaf node represents a unique suffix.
4. **Calculate the Encoding Length**: Sum up the lengths of all unique suffixes (leaf nodes) in the Trie, adding one for each `"#"` character.

## Code

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class Solution {
    public int minimumLengthEncoding(String[] words) {
        // Use a set to collect all unique words
        Set<String> uniqueWords = new HashSet<>();
        for (String word : words) {
            uniqueWords.add(word);
        }

        // Create a Trie
        TrieNode root = new TrieNode();

        // Insert words into the Trie in reverse order
        for (String word : uniqueWords) {
            insertReverse(root, word);
        }

        // Calculate the minimum length encoding
        return countEncodedLength(root);
    }

    private void insertReverse(TrieNode root, String word) {
        TrieNode node = root;
        for (int i = word.length() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            char ch = word.charAt(i);
            if (!node.children.containsKey(ch)) {
                node.children.put(ch, new TrieNode());
            }
            node = node.children.get(ch);
        }
        node.isEndOfWord = true;
    }

    private int countEncodedLength(TrieNode root) {
        return countEncodedLength(root, 1);
    }

    private int countEncodedLength(TrieNode node, int depth) {
        if (node.children.isEmpty()) {
            return depth;
        }

        int length = 0;
        for (TrieNode child : node.children.values()) {
            length += countEncodedLength(child, depth + 1);
        }
        return length;
    }

    // Definition for a TrieNode
    class TrieNode {
        boolean isEndOfWord;
        Map<Character, TrieNode> children;

        TrieNode() {
            isEndOfWord = false;
            children = new HashMap<>();
        }
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Insertion into Trie**: For each word of maximum length `L`, inserting into the Trie takes `O(L)`. Inserting all words will thus take `O(W * L)`, where `W` is the number of words.
2. **Calculating Length**: Traversing the Trie to sum up the encoding length is `O(W * L)` as well since we might visit each character of each word at most once.
   
Overall, the time complexity of the solution is `O(W * L)`.
