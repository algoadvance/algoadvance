[Leetcode 3025. Find the Number of Ways to Place People I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3025)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n` representing the number of people who need to be placed into seats. Each person can be placed either facing inward (I) or facing outward (O). You need to write a function that returns the number of distinct ways to place these people in seats such that the number of people facing inward is always greater than the number of people facing outward at any point in the sequence (except at the beginning).

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input constraints**: What is the range of the integer `n`?
   - **Answer**: The typical range in coding challenges is from 1 to around 19, but for this problem, let's assume we should be able to handle up to n=19.
   
2. **Output**: Should the function return an integer value representing the number of valid arrangements?
   - **Answer**: Yes.

3. **Edge Cases**: Should we consider any invalid input cases?
   - **Answer**: Assume valid inputs are always given as per the problem statement.

4. **Order of People**: Does the order of people matter?
   - **Answer**: Yes, the sequence in which people are placed (facing inward or outward) definitely matters.

### Strategy

The problem resembles the classic Catalan number problem, which counts the number of valid sequences of parentheses. Here, instead of parentheses, we are dealing with two states: inward (I) and outward (O). We can devise a solution based on dynamic programming that uses the recurrence relation of Catalan numbers:

`C(n) = C(0)C(n-1) + C(1)C(n-2) + ... + C(n-1)C(0)`

Where `C(n)` represents the nth Catalan number. We can build up these numbers from `C(0)` to `C(n)`.

### Code

```java
public class NumberOfWaysToPlacePeople {
    public int countWays(int n) {
        if (n == 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        
        int[] catalan = new int[n + 1];
        catalan[0] = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            catalan[i] = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                catalan[i] += catalan[j] * catalan[i - 1 - j];
            }
        }

        return catalan[n];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NumberOfWaysToPlacePeople solver = new NumberOfWaysToPlacePeople();
        int n = 3; // Example input, you can test with any valid n
        System.out.println("Number of ways to place people: " + solver.countWays(n));
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the provided code is `O(n^2)`. This is because we have two nested loops for each value of `i` which go through a constant number of operations. Given the constraints (n being typically small, under 20), this is efficient enough. Additionally, the space complexity is `O(n)` due to storing the intermediate values in the array.
