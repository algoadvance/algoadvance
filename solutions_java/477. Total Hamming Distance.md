[Leetcode 477. Total Hamming Distance](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l477)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, return the sum of Hamming distances between all the pairs of the integers in `nums`.

The Hamming distance between two integers is the number of positions at which the corresponding bits are different.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of inputs:** What are the constraints on the size of the input array (`nums`) and the values within the array?
   - Typically, `nums.length` can range from 1 to 10^4 and values in `nums` can be as large as 10^9.
2. **Input and Output Format:** 
   - Input: An integer array `nums`.
   - Output: An integer representing the total Hamming distance.
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Single element array.
   - Array with all elements being the same.

### Strategy
1. **Brute Force Approach**:
   - Calculate the Hamming distance for every pair of elements.
   - Time Complexity: O(N^2 * M) where N is the length of `nums` and M is the number of bits (around 30 for integers up to 10^9).
   - This approach is not efficient for large inputs.

2. **Efficient Approach**:
   - For each bit position from 0 to 30, count how many numbers have that bit set to 1 and how many have it set to 0.
   - For each bit position, the Hamming distance contribution is the product of these counts.
   - Sum up the contributions from all bit positions for the result.
   - Time Complexity: O(N * 30), which simplifies to O(N).

### Code
Here's the implementation of the efficient approach:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int totalHammingDistance(int[] nums) {
        int total = 0;
        int n = nums.length;
        
        // There are 30 bits to consider (since numbers are <= 10^9)
        for (int i = 0; i < 30; ++i) {
            int countOne = 0;
            for (int num : nums) {
                countOne += (num >> i) & 1;
            }
            int countZero = n - countOne;
            total += countOne * countZero;
        }
        
        return total;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Efficient approach**: O(N) where N is the length of the `nums` array. This is because for each of the 30 bit positions, we are iterating through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are only using a fixed amount of extra space.

This solution efficiently computes the total Hamming distance by leveraging bit manipulation and avoids the quadratic time complexity of the brute-force approach.
