[Leetcode 2048. Next Greater Numerically Balanced Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2048)
### Problem Statement

A numerically balanced number is a number where the count of each digit is equal to the digit itself. For instance, the number `122` is numerically balanced because it contains exactly one `1` and two `2`s.

Given an integer `n`, find the smallest numerically balanced number that is strictly greater than `n`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Input**: What is the maximum and minimum value for `n`? 
    - Usually, it would be within a reasonable range for computational limits in an interview setting, like up to `10^6` or `10^7`, but clarifying this would help.

2. **Output**: Should the solution output just the numerically balanced number itself?
    - Yes, I will assume we only need to return the numerically balanced number.

3. **Input Type**: Is `n` guaranteed to be a positive integer?
    - For this problem, yes, let's assume `n` is a positive integer.

### Strategy

To find the next numerically balanced number greater than a given integer `n`, we can employ a brute-force approach due to the combinatorial nature of the problem:

1. **Generate the next sequential number** starting from `n + 1`.
2. **Check if the number is numerically balanced** by counting the digits and comparing each count to the digit itself.
3. **Continue this process** until we find a valid numerically balanced number.

### Code

Here's the Java code to solve the problem:

```java
public class NextNumericallyBalancedNumber {
    
    public static int nextBalancedNumber(int n) {
        n++;
        
        while (!isNumericallyBalanced(n)) {
            n++;
        }
        
        return n;
    }
    
    private static boolean isNumericallyBalanced(int num) {
        int[] digitCount = new int[10];
        char[] digits = String.valueOf(num).toCharArray();
        
        for (char c : digits) {
            digitCount[c - '0']++;
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
            if (digitCount[i] != 0 && digitCount[i] != i) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return digitCount[0] == 0;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 123;
        System.out.println("Next numerically balanced number after " + n + " is " + nextBalancedNumber(n));
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **`nextBalancedNumber` function**:
    - Continually increments `n` and checks if the incremented number is numerically balanced.
2. **`isNumericallyBalanced` function**:
    - Converts the number to a string and counts occurrences of each digit.
    - Checks if each digit's occurrence matches the digit itself.
3. **Edge Cases**:
    - If `n` is such that the immediate next few integers are not numerically balanced, the program continues until it finds the correct one.
    - Assumes the input is a valid integer and does not handle non-integer or negative cases.

### Time Complexity

- **Outer Loop**: The loop in `nextBalancedNumber` could potentially run many times until it finds a balanced number.
- **Inner Loop and Digits Counting**:
    - Counting digits and checking the balance is O(d) per number, where d is the number of digits in the current number.

Hence, the overall time complexity is approximately O(k * d), where k is the number of increments needed to find the next balanced number, and d is the maximum number of digits in those numbers. Given the constraints, this approach should be feasible.
