[Leetcode 945. Minimum Increment to Make Array Unique](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l945)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `A`, in one move you can increment the value of one element of `A` by 1.

Return the minimum number of moves to make every value in `A` unique.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: [1,2,2]
Output: 1
Explanation: After 1 move, the array could be [1, 2, 3].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: [3,2,1,2,1,7]
Output: 6
Explanation: After 6 moves, the array could be [3, 4, 1, 2, 5, 7].
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format**: Are elements in array `A` guaranteed to be non-negative integers?
2. **Array Length**: What is the maximum possible length of the array `A`?
3. **Output**: The result should be a single integer representing the minimum number of increments.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. **Sorting**:
   - First, sort the array. Sorting helps to identify and handle duplicates more systematically.

2. **Increments**:
   - Traverse through the sorted array and ensure that each element is strictly greater than the previous one by incrementing the duplicates.
   - Maintain a counter to keep track of the number of moves made.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the strategy described:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MinimumIncrementToMakeArrayUnique {
    public int minIncrementForUnique(int[] A) {
        Arrays.sort(A);
        int moves = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < A.length; i++) {
            if (A[i] <= A[i - 1]) {
                int increment = A[i - 1] - A[i] + 1;
                A[i] += increment;
                moves += increment;
            }
        }
        return moves;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumIncrementToMakeArrayUnique solution = new MinimumIncrementToMakeArrayUnique();
        System.out.println(solution.minIncrementForUnique(new int[]{1, 2, 2}));  // Output: 1
        System.out.println(solution.minIncrementForUnique(new int[]{3, 2, 1, 2, 1, 7}));  // Output: 6
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: The time complexity for sorting the array is \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array.
- **Traversal**: The traversal through the array is \(O(n)\).

So, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which is \(O(n \log n)\).

### Summary

- Sort the array.
- Iterate through the sorted array and increment the duplicates.
- Calculate the total number of increments needed to make every element in the array unique.

This strategy ensures that we get the minimum number of increments required to achieve the goal.
