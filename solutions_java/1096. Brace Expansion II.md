[Leetcode 1096. Brace Expansion II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1096)
### Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem - **1096. Brace Expansion II**

Given a string expression representing a brace expansion, return the expansion sorted in lexicographic order.

The possible characters for the expression are:
- Lowercase alphabets
- Braces `{` and `}`
- Commas `,`
- Concatenation characters (implicit)

The expression can be thought of as alternating between sets of choices (inside `{}`) and concatenations of the elements in those sets.

### Example
Input: 
```plaintext
"{a,b}{c,{d,e}}"
```
Output: 
```plaintext
["ac","ad","ae","bc","bd","be"]
```

Input:
```plaintext
"// use example from above
```
Output:
```plaintext
["a","ab","ac","z"]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the length of the input string?
   **A:** You may assume that the expression's length does not exceed 1000 characters.

2. **Q:** Can the input string be empty or contain invalid characters?
   **A:** No. The input is guaranteed to be a valid expression with the given characters.

3. **Q:** Do we need to handle any white spaces within the expression?
   **A:** No. There will be no white spaces in the input string.

### Strategy

1. **Recursive Approach:**
   - Use a recursive approach to parse the input string.
   - Break the problem down by treating sets defined by `{}` and computing all possible combinations from these sets.
   - Use a helper function to process segments between the braces.
   - Maintain a set of results to avoid any duplicates and sort finally.

2. **String Concatenation:**
   - Handle concatenation by combining elements of previously computed sets.
   - For every new set, combine it with the previous results by concatenating each element of the previous set with each element of the new set.

3. **Iteration and Combination:**
   - Keep an iteration pointer and iterate through the string while handling the braces and commas.
   - Use a stack to maintain the context of braces.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class BraceExpansionII {
    public List<String> braceExpansionII(String expression) {
        Set<String> resultSet = new TreeSet<>(expand(expression));
        return new ArrayList<>(resultSet);
    }

    private Set<String> expand(String expr) {
        Stack<Set<String>> stack = new Stack<>();
        stack.push(new HashSet<>());
        int i = 0;
        while (i < expr.length()) {
            Set<String> curr = new HashSet<>();
            if (expr.charAt(i) == '{') {
                int j = i, level = 0;
                while (j < expr.length()) {
                    if (expr.charAt(j) == '{') level++;
                    if (expr.charAt(j) == '}') level--;
                    if (level == 0) break;
                    j++;
                }
                curr = expand(expr.substring(i + 1, j));
                i = j + 1;
            } else {
                int j = i;
                while (j < expr.length() && (Character.isLetter(expr.charAt(j)) || expr.charAt(j) == ',')) j++;
                String[] parts = expr.substring(i, j).split(",");
                for (String part : parts) curr.add(part);
                i = j;
            }

            if (stack.size() > 1 && (expr.charAt(i - 1) == '}' || expr.charAt(i) == '{' || expr.charAt(i) == ',')) {
                Set<String> top = stack.pop();
                Set<String> combined = new HashSet<>();
                for (String pre : top) {
                    for (String post : curr) {
                        combined.add(pre + post);
                    }
                }
                curr = combined;
            }

            stack.push(curr);

            if (i < expr.length() && expr.charAt(i) == '}') i++;
        }

        Set<String> finalSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (Set<String> set : stack) {
            finalSet.addAll(set);
        }
        return finalSet;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BraceExpansionII solution = new BraceExpansionII();
        System.out.println(solution.braceExpansionII("{a,b}{c,{d,e}}"));  // ["ac","ad","ae","bc","bd","be"]
        System.out.println(solution.braceExpansionII("// use example from above
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is \(O(2^k)\) where \(k\) is the number of sets since for each segment created by braces, it requires combining with all previous results. Given the input length is limited to 1000, this should be manageable within reasonable limits.

- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is \(O(2^k)\) to store all possible expansions within the results set.
