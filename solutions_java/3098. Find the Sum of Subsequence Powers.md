[Leetcode 3098. Find the Sum of Subsequence Powers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3098)
## Problem Statement:

Given an integer array `nums` containing `n` elements, you need to find the sum of the power of all non-empty subsequences of the array. The power of a subsequence is defined as the difference between the maximum element and the minimum element in the subsequence. Since the result can be very large, return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Example:

**Input:**
- nums = [2, 3, 6, 8]

**Output:**
- The sum of the power of all non-empty subsequences.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q:** Are the elements in the array distinct?
   **A:** Yes, assume all elements in `nums` are distinct.

2. **Q:** What is the size range of the input array?
   **A:** Assume the size of the array `n` will be between 1 and 100,000.

3. **Q:** Can we have negative numbers in the array?
   **A:** Assume all elements in the array `nums` are positive integers.

## Strategy:

To solve the problem, consider the following steps:

1. **Sort the Array:** First, sort the array `nums` to facilitate easier handling of maximum and minimum values in subsequences.
2. **Mathematical Insight:** For each element `nums[i]`:
   - It will act as the maximum element for all subsequences that include elements `nums[0]` to `nums[i-1]`.
   - It will act as the minimum element for all subsequences that include elements `nums[i+1]` to `nums[n-1]`.
3. **Subsequence Count:** For a sorted element `nums[i]`:
   - It will be the maximum for \(2^i\) subsequences.
   - It will be the minimum for \(2^{(n-i-1)}\) subsequences.
4. **Calculate the Contribution:** For each `nums[i]`, the total contribution to the sum is calculated by:
   \[
   (nums[i] \cdot 2^i - nums[i] \cdot 2^{(n-i-1)}) \bmod (10^9+7)
   \]

5. **Sum Up Contributions:** Accumulate the contributions of all elements to get the final result.

## Code:
```java
import java.util.*;

public class SubsequencePowerSum {
    private static final int MOD = 1000000007;

    public static int sumSubseqPowers(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int n = nums.length;
        
        long[] pow2 = new long[n];
        pow2[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            pow2[i] = (pow2[i - 1] * 2) % MOD;
        }
        
        long totalSum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            long maxContribution = (nums[i] * pow2[i]) % MOD;
            long minContribution = (nums[i] * pow2[n - i - 1]) % MOD;
            totalSum = (totalSum + maxContribution - minContribution + MOD) % MOD;
        }
        
        return (int)totalSum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {2, 3, 6, 8};
        System.out.println(sumSubseqPowers(nums)); // Expected output based on problem description.
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:

- Sorting the array takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- Precomputing powers of 2 and calculating contributions each take \(O(n)\).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

This approach efficiently solves the problem with the required modulo operation to handle large numbers.
