[Leetcode 1523. Count Odd Numbers in an Interval Range](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1523)
## Problem Statement
Given two non-negative integers `low` and `high`. Return the count of odd numbers between `low` and `high` (inclusive).

## Clarifying Questions
1. Q: Are the `low` and `high` values inclusive?
   A: Yes, both `low` and `high` are inclusive.
   
2. Q: Can `low` be greater than `high`?
   A: No, it is stated that `low` and `high` are non-negative integers and typically `low` will be less than or equal to `high`.

3. Q: What is the expected range of values for `low` and `high`?
   A: The values can be anywhere from 0 to \(10^9\).

## Strategy
1. First, determine how to count the odd numbers within any arbitrary range.
2. An individual number `n` is odd if `n % 2 != 0`.
3. Check a few cases:
   - Both `low` and `high` are even.
   - Both `low` and `high` are odd.
   - One is even and the other is odd.
4. Use arithmetic to derive a generic formula to count odd numbers between `low` and `high`.

### Approach:
1. Count the total number of integers between `low` and `high` which is `(high - low + 1)`.
2. Since every two consecutive numbers always have one odd number, divide the count by 2.
3. Add an extra count if either `low` or `high` is odd since the inclusive range includes an additional odd number.

### Implementation Steps:
1. Calculate the total count of numbers in the range.
2. Calculate the base number of odds by `(high - low + 1) // 2`.
3. If either `low` or `high` is odd, add 1 to the base count.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int countOdds(int low, int high) {
        // Step 1: Count the total numbers in the range
        int totalNumbers = high - low + 1;
        
        // Step 2: Calculate the number of odd numbers
        int oddCount = totalNumbers / 2;

        // Step 3: Check if either low or high is odd
        if (low % 2 != 0 || high % 2 != 0) {
            oddCount++;
        }

        return oddCount;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(1)\) since the steps to determine the count of odd numbers in the range are based on simple arithmetic calculations, without any iteration or recursion.
