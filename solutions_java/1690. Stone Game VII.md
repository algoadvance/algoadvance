[Leetcode 1690. Stone Game VII](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1690)
### Problem Statement

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first. There are `n` stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, they can remove either the leftmost stone or the rightmost stone from the row and receive points equal to the sum of the remaining stones. The objective of the game is to maximize the points a player can receive. The score difference between Alice and Bob is Alice's score minus Bob's score. Return the maximum score difference Alice can achieve if both players play optimally.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Details:** Can the array `stones` have negative values, or is it guaranteed to be non-negative integers?
   - **Assumption:** The array will contain non-negative integers.
2. **Player Moves:** When a player removes a stone, they don't accumulate that stone's value, but instead get points equal to the sum of the remaining stones?
   - **Clarification:** Yes, the removed stone's value is subtracted from the cumulative score calculation.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - We'll use a 2D DP array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum score difference the current player can achieve with the stones `stones[i]` to `stones[j]`.
   - We'll compute the prefix sum array `prefixSum` to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray.
   - The relation to fill the DP table will be based on optimal decisions by both players:
     - `dp[i][j]` will be calculated as the maximum of:
       - Taking the leftmost stone: `sum[i+1][j] - dp[i+1][j]`
       - Taking the rightmost stone: `sum[i][j-1] - dp[i][j-1]`

### Code

```java
public class StoneGameVII {
    public int stoneGameVII(int[] stones) {
        int n = stones.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n][n];
        int[] prefixSum = new int[n + 1];

        // Compute prefix sum array
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            prefixSum[i + 1] = prefixSum[i] + stones[i];
        }

        // Fill the DP table
        for (int len = 2; len <= n; ++len) { // length of the current segment
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - len; ++i) {
                int j = i + len - 1; // segment endpoints i and j
                int sumIJ = prefixSum[j + 1] - prefixSum[i];
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(sumIJ - stones[i] - dp[i + 1][j], sumIJ - stones[j] - dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }

        return dp[0][n - 1];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StoneGameVII game = new StoneGameVII();
        int[] stones = {5, 3, 1, 4, 2};
        System.out.println(game.stoneGameVII(stones));  // Output should be the maximum score difference
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n^2)` because we are filling a 2D DP table with nested loops over possible subarray lengths and starting points.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n^2)` due to the storage of the DP table, and `O(n)` for the prefix sum array. 

The provided solution ensures an optimal strategy for both players, with a structured dynamic programming approach to achieve the maximum score difference Alice can attain.
