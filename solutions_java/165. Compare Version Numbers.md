[Leetcode 165. Compare Version Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l165)
### Problem Statement

The task is to compare two version numbers, `version1` and `version2`. 

Each version number is composed of one or more revisions joined by a dot (`.`). Each revision consists of digits and may contain leading zeros. Each version can have multiple revisions.

Compare the versions and return:
- `1` if `version1` is greater than `version2`
- `-1` if `version1` is less than `version2`
- `0` if they are equal

For example:
- `Input: version1 = "1.01", version2 = "1.001" Output: 0`
- `Input: version1 = "1.0", version2 = "1.0.0" Output: 0`
- `Input: version1 = "0.1", version2 = "1.1" Output: -1`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the versions always valid and well-formed?** 
   - Yes, versions will be well-formed as described.

2. **What is the length range of the version strings?**
   - Each version string length will be within reasonable limits for comparison.

3. **Is it safe to assume that versions with extra trailing zeros are equal to versions without those zeros (like `1.0` and `1.0.0`)?**
   - Yes, trailing zeros should not affect the comparison result.

### Strategy

1. **Split the version strings**: Using the `split("\\.")` method in Java to break the version strings into their individual numeric components.
2. **Normalize lengths**: Compare corresponding components; if lengths differ, components beyond the shorter version are treated as zeros.
3. **Integer comparison**: Convert each component to an integer and compare them sequentially from left to right.
4. **Return the appropriate comparison result** based on the first non-equal pair of version components.

### Code

```java
public class CompareVersionNumbers {
    public int compareVersion(String version1, String version2) {
        String[] v1Parts = version1.split("\\.");
        String[] v2Parts = version2.split("\\.");
        
        int length = Math.max(v1Parts.length, v2Parts.length);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            int v1Component = i < v1Parts.length ? Integer.parseInt(v1Parts[i]) : 0;
            int v2Component = i < v2Parts.length ? Integer.parseInt(v2Parts[i]) : 0;
            
            if (v1Component > v2Component) {
                return 1;
            } else if (v1Component < v2Component) {
                return -1;
            }
        }
        
        return 0;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CompareVersionNumbers comparator = new CompareVersionNumbers();
        
        System.out.println(comparator.compareVersion("1.01", "1.001")); // Output: 0
        System.out.println(comparator.compareVersion("1.0", "1.0.0"));  // Output: 0
        System.out.println(comparator.compareVersion("0.1", "1.1"));    // Output: -1
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(max(N, M))**, where `N` and `M` are the lengths of the version strings when split by `.`. This ensures that we linearly compare each component pair and, therefore, achieve efficient comparison.
