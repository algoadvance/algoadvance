[Leetcode 2028. Find Missing Observations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2028)
### Problem Statement

You have observations of a 6-sided die (dice) rolls and a certain number of missing observations also. For example, `rolls = [1, 5, 6]` and `missingRolls = 3`. You need to find the possible values of the missing observations such that the average of all the observations (including the missing ones) equals `mean`.

Formally, you are given an integer array `rolls`, an integer `mean`, and an integer `n` representing the number of missing observations, and you need to find an array of length `n` containing the missing observations. If there are multiple valid sequences, you can return any of them. If there is no possible sequence, return an empty array.

### Example

- Input: `rolls = [3, 2, 4, 3]`, `mean = 4`, `n = 2`
- Output: `[6, 6]`
- Explanation: The average of all observations (including the missing ones) should be 4. The sum of current observations is 12, and the sum of all observations should be 20. Hence, the sum of the missing observations should be 8, and `[6, 6]` has a sum of 8.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are we guaranteed that there is a valid sequence of missing rolls?
2. Can rolls have values other than 1 to 6?
3. Is there a preference for having smaller or larger numbers in the missing rolls sequence?

Without these constraints being violated, we can proceed with the implementation.

### Strategy

1. Calculate the desired total sum of all observations, including the `rolls` array and the `missingRolls`.
2. Determine the sum of the observations already present in the `rolls` array.
3. Subtract the sum of the current `rolls` from the desired total to get the sum needed from the `missingRolls`.
4. Distribute this required sum across the `n` missing rolls, ensuring each roll is between 1 and 6.

### Steps

1. Calculate the total sum needed: `totalSum = mean * (len(rolls) + n)`.
2. Calculate the sum of the current observations: `currentSum = sum(rolls)`.
3. Determine the sum needed from missing rolls: `missingSum = totalSum - currentSum`.
4. If the `missingSum` is not between `n` (lowest possible sum) and `6 * n` (highest possible sum), return an empty array.
5. Initialize an array of length `n` with 1's.
6. Distribute the remaining part of `missingSum` equally among the array ensuring all values are valid dice rolls (1 to 6).

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class FindMissingObservations {
    public int[] missingRolls(int[] rolls, int mean, int n) {
        int currentSum = Arrays.stream(rolls).sum();
        int totalSum = mean * (rolls.length + n);
        int missingSum = totalSum - currentSum;

        // Check if distributing the missingSum is possible with the given constraints
        if (missingSum < n || missingSum > 6 * n) {
            return new int[0];
        }

        int[] result = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(result, 1);  // Start with the minimum value

        missingSum -= n;  // Adjust the missing sum to distribute over the remaining difference

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int addValue = Math.min(5, missingSum);  // We can add at most 5 to a value of 1
            result[i] += addValue;
            missingSum -= addValue;
            if (missingSum == 0) {
                break;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FindMissingObservations finder = new FindMissingObservations();
        int[] rolls = {3, 2, 4, 3};
        int mean = 4;
        int n = 2;
        int[] result = finder.missingRolls(rolls, mean, n);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(result));  // Output: [6, 6]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Calculating the sum of existing rolls is O(m) where m is the length of the `rolls` array.
- Adjusting the `missingSum` is O(n).

Overall, the time complexity is O(m + n), which is efficient for the problem's constraints.
