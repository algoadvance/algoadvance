[Leetcode 206. Reverse Linked List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l206)
### Problem Statement

Reverse a singly linked list.

#### Example:

```
Input: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> NULL
Output: 5 -> 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> NULL
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned?**  
   Return the head of the reversed linked list.

2. **Can the list be empty?**  
   Yes, the input list can be empty. In this case, return `null`.

3. **Is the input list guaranteed to be a singly linked list?**  
   Yes.

### Strategy

1. **Iterative Approach:**
   - Initialize three pointers: `prev` as `null`, `curr` as head, and `next` as `null`.
   - Traverse through the linked list.
   - In each iteration:
     - Store the next node.
     - Reverse the link of the current node.
     - Move the `prev` and `curr` one step forward.

2. **Recursive Approach:**
   - Base case: If the current node is `null` or the next node is `null`, return the current node.
   - Recursively reverse the rest of the list.
   - Adjust the pointers to reverse the current node.

### Code

Here is the Java implementation using both iterative and recursive approaches.

#### Iterative Approach

```java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

public class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode prev = null;
        ListNode curr = head;
        while (curr != null) {
            ListNode next = curr.next;
            curr.next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = next;
        }
        return prev;
    }
}
```

#### Recursive Approach

```java
public class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) return head;
        ListNode p = reverseList(head.next);
        head.next.next = head;
        head.next = null;
        return p;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Iterative Approach:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the list only once.
- **Recursive Approach:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. There is a function call for each node.

In both approaches, the space complexity is O(1) for the iterative approach and O(n) for the recursive approach (due to the stack used for function calls).
