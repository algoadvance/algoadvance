[Leetcode 968. Binary Tree Cameras](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l968)
### Problem Statement:
You are given the root of a binary tree. We install cameras on the tree nodes where each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.

Return the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can a camera monitor more than just its own node?**
   - Yes, a camera placed at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children.

2. **What are the constraints on the number of nodes in the tree?**
   - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].

3. **Is every node required to be monitored?**
   - Yes, every node in the tree must be monitored by at least one camera.

### Strategy:
The problem can be approached using a greedy algorithm with depth-first search (DFS). We should place cameras in such a way that minimizes the total number of cameras used.

1. We will use a post-order traversal (DFS) to decide where to place cameras based on the state of the children nodes.
  
2. For each node, we will determine its state based on its children:
    - **State 0**: Node needs to be monitored.
    - **State 1**: Node has a camera.
    - **State 2**: Node is covered but does not have a camera.
  
3. The recurrence relation will consider the three states:
    - If any of the child nodes is in state 0, the current node will need a camera (return 1).
    - If any of the child nodes is in state 1, the current node is covered (return 2).
    - If all child nodes are in state 2, the current node needs to be monitored (return 0).

4. The root node's state will determine if an additional camera is needed at the end of the DFS traversal.

### Code:
```java
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left, right;
    TreeNode(int x) {
        val = x;
    }
}

public class BinaryTreeCameras {
    private int cameras;

    public int minCameraCover(TreeNode root) {
        cameras = 0;
        if (dfs(root) == 0) {
            cameras++;
        }
        return cameras;
    }
    
    private int dfs(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return 2;
        }
        
        int left = dfs(node.left);
        int right = dfs(node.right);
        
        if (left == 0 || right == 0) {
            cameras++;
            return 1;
        }
        
        if (left == 1 || right == 1) {
            return 2;
        }
        
        return 0;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree, because each node is visited once during the depth-first search traversal.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is O(H), where H is the height of the tree due to the recursion stack during DFS. In the worst case, H could be N (in case of a skewed tree), making the space complexity O(N) in the worst case.
