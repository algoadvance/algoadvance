[Leetcode 3234. Count the Number of Substrings With Dominant Ones](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3234)
### Problem Statement
You are given a binary string `s` consisting of only '0's and '1's. A substring is **dominant** if it contains strictly more '1's than '0's. Your task is to return the number of dominant substrings in `s`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the input string guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, the problem statement implies this by nature as we are counting substrings.
2. **Is there a maximum length for the string?**
   - Generally, for coding problems like this, constraints often suggest the string can be quite large (up to 10^5 characters). We should ensure our algorithm is efficient.
3. **Is the string always binary?**
   - Yes, the problem specifies the string consists of only '0's and '1's.

### Strategy
1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - For a substring to be dominant, it should contain more '1's than '0's. This implies that for any substring `s[i:j]`, the count of '1's should be greater than the count of '0's.

2. **Iterating Through Substrings:**
   - We could use a brute force approach where we consider every possible substring, but this would be inefficient for large strings since it would require O(n^3) time complexity (generating substrings and counting ones and zeros).
   
3. **Efficient Approach:**
   - We'll use a sliding window and prefix sums to efficiently count the number of dominant substrings. This involves:
     - Maintaining a count balance where '1' increments the balance and '0' decrements the balance.
     - Using a map to track the first occurrence of each balance value.
     - For every end index of the substring, calculate possible starting indices where the balance difference indicates a dominant substring.

### Code
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class CountTheNumberOfDominantSubstrings {
    public int countDominantSubstrings(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int balance = 0;
        int dominantCount = 0;
        Map<Integer, Integer> balanceMap = new HashMap<>();
        balanceMap.put(0, 1);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            balance += (s.charAt(i) == '1') ? 1 : -1;
            
            if (balanceMap.containsKey(balance)) {
                dominantCount += balanceMap.get(balance);
            }
            
            balanceMap.put(balance, balanceMap.getOrDefault(balance, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        return dominantCount;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CountTheNumberOfDominantSubstrings solution = new CountTheNumberOfDominantSubstrings();
        System.out.println(solution.countDominantSubstrings("110")); // Output should be 4
        System.out.println(solution.countDominantSubstrings("1001")); // Output should be 4
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Balance Calculation:** 
   - Traverse the string and maintain a balance where '1' increments the balance by 1 and '0' decrements it by 1.
2. **Map Utilization for Balance Counts:**
   - Use a hash map to store the counts of each balance.
   - For each position, check how many times the current balance has occurred before. Each of these occurrences indicates a new dominant substring ending at the current position.
3. **Efficient Counting:**
   - By counting balanced states, we can determine the number of substrings that have a net positive balance without explicitly generating them, achieving an efficient O(n) solution.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we traverse the string only once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case for storing balance states in the map.
