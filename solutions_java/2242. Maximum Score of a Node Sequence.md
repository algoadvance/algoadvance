[Leetcode 2242. Maximum Score of a Node Sequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2242)
## Problem Statement

You are given an undirected graph in the form of an integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` is the value at node `i`. Additionally, you are given a 2D integer array `edges`, where `edges[j] = [u, v]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes `u` and `v`.

A node sequence is defined as a sequence of four distinct nodes `(a, b, c, d)` such that there is an edge between `a` and `b`, `b` and `c`, and `c` and `d`. The score of a node sequence is defined as the sum of values of the nodes in the sequence, i.e., `nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] + nums[d]`.

Return the maximum score of a node sequence among all possible node sequences. If there are no valid sequences, return -1.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the graph guaranteed to be connected?**
   - Not necessarily. The graph can have multiple components.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the values in `nums`?**
   - No, the values in `nums` can be any integer.

3. **What is the range of the nodes and edges?**
   - Typically, nodes will be indexed from `0` to `n-1` where `n` is the length of `nums`. The constraints can suggest input lengths for edge cases.

## Strategy

1. **Graph Representation and Adjacency List:**
   - First, use an adjacency list to represent the graph.
   
2. **Top Neighbors:**
   - For each node, maintain the top 3 neighbors with the highest `nums` values. This helps in constructing potential sequences efficiently.
   
3. **Iterate Over Edges:**
   - For each edge `(b, c)`, try to form valid sequences by joining the neighbors of `b` and `c`, while ensuring all nodes are distinct.

4. **Scoring:**
   - Compute the score for each potential sequence and keep track of the maximum score found.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Return `-1` if no valid sequences are found.

## Code

Here's the solution in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int maximumScore(int[] nums, int[][] edges) {
        int n = nums.length;
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            graph.get(u).add(v);
            graph.get(v).add(u);
        }
        
        // Maintain top 3 neighbors for each node
        int[][] topNeighbors = new int[n][3];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            Arrays.fill(topNeighbors[i], -1);
        }
        
        for (int b = 0; b < n; b++) {
            PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[1], b[1]));
            for (int neighbor : graph.get(b)) {
                pq.offer(new int[]{neighbor, nums[neighbor]});
                if (pq.size() > 3) {
                    pq.poll();
                }
            }
            int idx = 0;
            while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
                topNeighbors[b][idx++] = pq.poll()[0];
            }
        }
        
        int maxScore = -1;
        
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            int b = edge[0];
            int c = edge[1];
            
            for (int a : topNeighbors[b]) {
                if (a == -1 || a == b || a == c) continue;
                
                for (int d : topNeighbors[c]) {
                    if (d == -1 || d == b || d == c || d == a) continue;
                    
                    int score = nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] + nums[d];
                    maxScore = Math.max(maxScore, score);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return maxScore;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Graph Representation:** O(E) for initializing the adjacency list.
- **Top Neighbors Calculation:** O(E log 3) ≈ O(E) since each node's neighbors are considered using a priority queue of size at most 3.
- **Score Calculation:** O(E * 9) ≈ O(E), where each edge considers a constant number of potential sequences.

Thus, the overall time complexity is approximately **O(E)**, which is efficient for typical graph problems.
