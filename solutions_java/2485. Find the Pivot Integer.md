[Leetcode 2485. Find the Pivot Integer](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2485)
### Problem Statement:
You are given a positive integer `n`. The task is to find a pivot integer `x` that satisfies the following condition: the sum of all integers from `1` to `x` is equal to the sum of all integers from `x` to `n`. If no such `x` exists, return `-1`. If multiple such `x` exist, you can return any of them.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can `n` be very large or is there a constraint on the size of `n`?**
   Typically, we might assume `n` is within a practical range suitable for medium complexity algorithms, but specific constraints were not provided.
2. **Do we need to handle any possible edge cases, such as `n = 1`?**
   Given `n` is a positive integer, itâ€™s good to consider all edge cases including the smallest valid `n`.

### Strategy:
1. The sum of integers from `1` to `x` can be expressed using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: `S1 = x * (x + 1) / 2`.
2. Similarly, the sum of integers from `x` to `n` can also be expressed, but this is from `x+1` to `n` plus `x`: `S2 = x + (n * (n + 1) / 2 - x * (x - 1) / 2)`.
3. Therefore, we need to compute and compare these two expressions to find the pivot point.
4. If the given equation holds for any `x` in the range `1` to `n`, we return `x`. Otherwise, we return `-1`.

### Code:
```java
public class Solution {
    public int pivotInteger(int n) {
        // total sum of all numbers from 1 to n
        int totalSum = (n * (n + 1)) / 2;
        
        // sum from 1 to x should be equal to sum from x to n
        int currentSum = 0;
        for (int x = 1; x <= n; x++) {
            currentSum += x;
            if (currentSum == totalSum - currentSum + x) {
                return x;
            }
        }
        
        return -1; // if no pivot found
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.pivotInteger(8)); // Output will be an integer that satisfies the condition, or -1 if none exists
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)` due to the single loop iterating through all integers from `1` to `n`. This is efficient given that we are comparing sums within this bounded input range. 

### Explanation:
- We first calculate the total sum of integers from `1` to `n`.
- Then, we iterate from `1` to `n` and calculate the running sum (`currentSum`).
- At each integer `x`, we check if `currentSum` equals the remaining sum (`totalSum - currentSum + x`).
- If the condition is met, we return `x` as the pivot integer.
- If no such integer is found after the loop completes, we return `-1`.

This solution correctly identifies the pivot integer or determines that none exists in linear time, ensuring efficient processing for typical input sizes.
