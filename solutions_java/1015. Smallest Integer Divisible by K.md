[Leetcode 1015. Smallest Integer Divisible by K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1015)
## Problem Statement
The problem is to determine the smallest positive integer `N` such that:
- `N` contains only the digit `1` (for example, `1`, `11`, `111`, ...), and
- `N` is divisible by a given positive integer `K`.

Return `-1` if no such `N` exists.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of `K`:** What are the constraints on the value of `K`?
   - **Constraint:** `K` is a positive integer, `1 <= K <= 10^5`.

2. **Output requirement:** Should the number `N` itself be returned or just its length?
   - **Clarification:** Only the length of `N` is required. `Return N % K == 0`.

3. **Handling Large Integers:** Since `N` can grow very large, do we need to worry about potential overflow, and should we consider efficient storage?
   - **Clarification:** Given the very high possible values, it is efficient to compute modularity dynamically without actually constructing large numbers.

## Strategy
1. **Residue Tracking:**
   - Track the residues mod `K` encountered when building numbers of the form `1, 11, 111, ...`.
   - If we encounter a residue that we have seen before, it implies that we are in a cycle and thus no such `N` can be formed.

2. **Length Calculation:**
   - Start with the first number `1` and compute `1 % K`.
   - Iteratively build the next number by appending `1` (i.e., `N = 11, 111, 1111,...`) and compute its modulus `K`.
   - Track the length of the number being built.

3. **Cycle Detection:**
   - Use a set to track residues. If a residue repeats, it means we're in an infinite loop, and hence no valid `N` exists.

## Code
```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class Solution {
    public int smallestRepunitDivByK(int K) {
        if (K % 2 == 0 || K % 5 == 0) {
            return -1; // A number with only 1s is never divisible by 2 or 5.
        }
        
        Set<Integer> seenRemainders = new HashSet<>();
        int remainder = 0;
        
        for (int length = 1; length <= K; length++) {
            remainder = (remainder * 10 + 1) % K;
            if (remainder == 0) {
                return length;
            }
            if (seenRemainders.contains(remainder)) {
                return -1;
            }
            seenRemainders.add(remainder);
        }
        
        return -1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.smallestRepunitDivByK(1)); // 1
        System.out.println(sol.smallestRepunitDivByK(3)); // 3
        System.out.println(sol.smallestRepunitDivByK(2)); // -1
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(K)`. In the worst case, we will iterate up to `K` times.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(K)`. We are storing up to `K` different remainders in a hash set.

This solution ensures that we efficiently find the smallest integer `N` such that `N % K == 0` with the number represented only by the digit `1`.
