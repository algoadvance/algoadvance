[Leetcode 83. Remove Duplicates from Sorted List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l83)
### Problem Statement

**LeetCode 83: Remove Duplicates from Sorted List**

Given the head of a sorted linked list, delete all duplicates such that each element appears only once. Return the linked list sorted as well.

#### Example:
```
Input: head = [1, 1, 2]
Output: [1, 2]

Input: head = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3]
Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input list be empty?**
   - Yes, the input list can be empty. An empty list should return an empty list.

2. **Is the list always sorted?**
   - Yes, the input list is given to be sorted.

3. **Do we need to handle cases with non-integer values?**
   - No, the problem specifies that the list will contain integers.

### Strategy

1. Initialize a pointer, `current`, to the head of the linked list.
2. Traverse the list with the `current` pointer.
3. For each node, check if the value of the current node is the same as the value of the next node (`current.next`).
4. If it is, skip the next node by setting `current.next` to `current.next.next`.
5. If it is not, move `current` to the next node.
6. Continue this process until the end of the list is reached.
7. Return the head of the modified list.

### Code

```java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

public class Solution {
    public ListNode deleteDuplicates(ListNode head) {
        // Start from the head of the list
        ListNode current = head;
        
        // Traverse the list
        while (current != null && current.next != null) {
            // Check if current node is the same as next node
            if (current.val == current.next.val) {
                // Skip the next node
                current.next = current.next.next;
            } else {
                // Move to the next node
                current = current.next;
            }
        }
        
        return head;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we are not using any extra space proportional to the input size, just a few pointers.

This solution ensures that all duplicate nodes are removed from the sorted list efficiently, maintaining a linear time complexity and a constant space complexity.
