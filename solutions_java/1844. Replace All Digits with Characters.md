[Leetcode 1844. Replace All Digits with Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1844)
### Problem Statement

**1844. Replace All Digits with Characters**

You are given a 0-indexed string `s` that has lowercase English letters in its even indices and digits in its odd indices.

There is a function defined as `shift(c, x)` where `c` is a character and `x` is a digit, that shifts `c` forward in the alphabet by `x` positions.

- For example, `shift('a', 1) = 'b'` and `shift('x', 3) = 'a'`.

Replace every digit in `s` with `shift(s[i-1], s[i])`.

Return the modified string `s`.

**Example 1:**
```plaintext
Input: s = "a1c1e1"
Output: "abcdef"
Explanation: The digits are replaced as follows:
- s[1] -> shift('a', 1) = 'b'
- s[3] -> shift('c', 1) = 'd'
- s[5] -> shift('e', 1) = 'f'
```

**Example 2:**
```plaintext
Input: s = "a1b2c3d4e"
Output: "abbdcfdhe"
Explanation: The digits are replaced as follows:
- s[1] -> shift('a', 1) = 'b'
- s[3] -> shift('b', 2) = 'd'
- s[5] -> shift('c', 3) = 'f'
- s[7] -> shift('d', 4) = 'h'
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all the characters in the string lowercase English letters and digits?**
   - Yes, as per the problem statement.

2. **Would input strings always be valid as per the given constraints?**
   - Yes, you can assume the input will conform to the specified format (letters at even indices and digits at odd indices).

3. **Would there be any scenarios where input string is empty?**
   - No, according to the examples provided, we can infer the input string is non-empty.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Initialize a `StringBuilder` to construct the final string.
2. Iterate through the given string `s`.
3. For characters at even indices, append them directly to the `StringBuilder`.
4. For digits at odd indices:
   - Convert the previous character (even index) and the current digit to the corresponding shifted character using the `shift` function.
   - Append the shifted character to the `StringBuilder`.
5. Convert the `StringBuilder` to a final string and return it.

**Helper Method:**
- `shift(char c, int x)`: This method takes a character `c` and an integer `x`, then returns the character shifted `x` positions forward in the alphabet.

### Code Implementation

```java
public class ReplaceDigitsWithCharacters {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s1 = "a1c1e1";
        String s2 = "a1b2c3d4e";
        
        System.out.println(replaceDigits(s1));  // Output: "abcdef"
        System.out.println(replaceDigits(s2));  // Output: "abbdcfdhe"
    }

    public static String replaceDigits(String s) {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char currentChar = s.charAt(i);
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                result.append(currentChar);
            } else {
                int shiftValue = currentChar - '0';
                char previousChar = s.charAt(i - 1);
                char shiftedChar = shift(previousChar, shiftValue);
                result.append(shiftedChar);
            }
        }
        
        return result.toString();
    }

    private static char shift(char c, int x) {
        return (char) (c + x);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`. We iterate through the string once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), due to the usage of `StringBuilder` to store the resulting string.

This solution is efficient for the given problem and adheres to the constraints provided.
