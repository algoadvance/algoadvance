[Leetcode 1914. Cyclically Rotating a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1914)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid` representing a 2D grid. Cyclically rotate the grid clockwise by moving the elements of each non-overlapping 2x2 subgrid in a lexicographical order. You need to apply this rotation to every 2x2 subgrid in the matrix and return the result matrix.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Edge Cases**: 
   - What if the size of the grid is less than 2x2? The problem constraints might ensure this doesn't happen, but it's worth confirming.
   - Are the dimensions of the grid always such that they can be evenly divided into 2x2 subgrids?

2. **Input/Output**:
   - Should the function perform rotations in place, or return a new grid?
   - Will the grid always be non-empty?

Let's assume the following:

- The grid's dimensions are always `m x n` where both `m` and `n` are even.
- The function should return a new grid after performing the required rotations.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate through the grid in steps of 2**:
   - For each 2x2 subgrid, extract the elements.
   - Sort the elements lexicographically.
   - Place them back in the 2x2 subgrid in clockwise order starting from the top-left.

2. **Rotation Logic**:
   - A 2x2 subgrid has the following rotation: 
     ```
     a b
     d c
     ```
     And it will rotate to:
     ```
     d a
     c b
     ```

### Code

Here is a Java implementation based on the above strategy:

```java
public class CyclicRotateGrid {

    public static int[][] rotateGrid(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        int[][] rotatedGrid = new int[m][n];
        
        // Copying original grid to new grid, as we will be modifying the cells
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                rotatedGrid[i][j] = grid[i][j];
            }
        }

        // Iterate each 2x2 sub-grid
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i += 2) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j += 2) {
                // Capturing the values in the current 2x2 subgrid
                int a = grid[i][j];
                int b = grid[i][j+1];
                int c = grid[i+1][j+1];
                int d = grid[i+1][j];

                // Perform cyclic rotation
                rotatedGrid[i][j] = d;
                rotatedGrid[i][j+1] = a;
                rotatedGrid[i+1][j+1] = b;
                rotatedGrid[i+1][j] = c;
            }
        }
        
        return rotatedGrid;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] grid = {
            {1, 2, 3, 4},
            {5, 6, 7, 8},
            {9, 10, 11, 12},
            {13, 14, 15, 16}
        };
        
        int[][] rotatedGrid = rotateGrid(grid);
        
        for (int[] row : rotatedGrid) {
            for (int value : row) {
                System.out.print(value + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is **O(m * n)** where `m` and `n` are the dimensions of the grid. This is because:
- We iterate through every element of the grid once.
- The operations within the nested loops (capturing and placing elements) take constant time O(1).

This results in an efficient solution for the problem.
