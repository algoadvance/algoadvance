[Leetcode 1846. Maximum Element After Decreasing and Rearranging](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1846)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `arr` of positive integers, you can perform two types of operations on the array any number of times:

1. Decrease the value of any element of the array to a smaller positive integer.
2. Rearrange the elements of the array in any order.

Return the maximum possible value of an element in the array such that the difference between any two consecutive elements is at most 1.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of array size:** What is the possible range of the size of the array `arr`?
   - Typically, constraints are given in the problem statement. Assume the size of the array can be large, e.g., up to 10^5.

2. **Element Values:** What is the range of values in the array `arr`?
   - Positive integers, typically within a reasonable range, such as `1` to `10^5`.

3. **Unique Elements:** Are the elements in the array `arr` unique, or can they have duplicates?
   - Elements in the array can have duplicates.

## Strategy

1. **Sort the Array:** Start by sorting the array. Sorting helps in arranging the elements orderly.
2. **Adjust Elements:** Iterate through the sorted array and adjust the elements so that the difference between consecutive elements is at most 1, and maintain the validity of the array.

   - After sorting, set the first element to `1` since the minimum possible positive integer is `1`.
   - For each subsequent element, ensure it is at most 1 greater than the previous element. This can be achieved by taking the minimum of the current element and the previous element + 1.

Example:
- Input: `[2, 2, 1, 2, 1]`
- Sorted: `[1, 1, 2, 2, 2]`
- Adjusted: `[1, 2, 2, 3, 4]`
- Output: `4`

## Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int maximumElementAfterDecrementingAndRearranging(int[] arr) {
        // Step 1: Sort the array
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        
        // Step 2: Adjust the elements
        arr[0] = 1; // Step 3: Set the first element to 1
        
        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            arr[i] = Math.min(arr[i], arr[i - 1] + 1);
        }
        
        // The maximum element at the end
        return arr[arr.length - 1];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] arr = {2, 2, 1, 2, 1};
        System.out.println(solution.maximumElementAfterDecrementingAndRearranging(arr)); // Output should be 4
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** Sorting the array takes `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the length of the array.
- **Adjustment:** Traversing the array to adjust the elements takes `O(n)`.

Overall time complexity is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step.

This should be efficient enough given typical constraints in coding interviews.
