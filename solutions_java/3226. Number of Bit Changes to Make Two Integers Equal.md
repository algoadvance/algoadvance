[Leetcode 3226. Number of Bit Changes to Make Two Integers Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3226)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integers, `start` and `goal`, and you need to determine the number of bit changes required to convert `start` to `goal`. A bit change means flipping a bit from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Values:**
   - What is the range of values for `start` and `goal`?
     - Typically, they are within the range of integers in Java, i.e., -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647.
  
2. **Binary Representation:**
   - Do I need to consider the two numbers in their 32-bit binary form, including signs?
     - For simplicity, considering their 32-bit representation will suffice.

3. **Leading Zeros:**
   - Should leading zeros be considered in the bit representations?
     - Yes, in a typical 32-bit representation, leading zeros should indeed be considered.

### Strategy

1. **Bitwise XOR Operation:**
   - Utilize the XOR operation between `start` and `goal`, as XOR between two bits results in 1 if they are different and 0 if they are the same.
   - Counting the number of 1s in the result of the XOR will give the number of bit changes required.

2. **Count Set Bits:**
   - Implement a method to count the number of 1s (set bits) in a binary representation of the XOR result. This can be done using `Integer.bitCount()` in Java.

### Code

Here's the implementation in Java:

```java
public class BitChangeCounter {

    public static int bitChangesToEqual(int start, int goal) {
        // XOR the two numbers; different bits between two numbers will be 1
        int xorResult = start ^ goal;
        
        // Count the number of 1s in the binary representation of xorResult
        return Integer.bitCount(xorResult);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int start = 29;    // Example start value
        int goal = 15;     // Example goal value
        
        System.out.println("Number of bit changes required: " + bitChangesToEqual(start, goal));
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **XOR Operation:**
   - `int xorResult = start ^ goal;`
   - This line calculates the XOR of `start` and `goal`. Each bit in the result is 1 if the corresponding bits of `start` and `goal` differ.

2. **Counting Set Bits:**
   - `return Integer.bitCount(xorResult);`
   - This line counts the number of 1s in the `xorResult`. `Integer.bitCount()` is a utility method in Java that efficiently counts the number of 1-bits.

3. **Main Method:**
   - Contains a simple example to demonstrate the function.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this approach is **O(1)** since the XOR operation and bit count are both performed in constant time for a fixed integer size (32 bits).
- The space complexity is **O(1)** as well, as we are using a constant amount of space.

This solution is both efficient and straightforward due to the bitwise operations involved.
