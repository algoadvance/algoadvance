[Leetcode 1539. Kth Missing Positive Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1539)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `arr` of positive integers sorted in a strictly increasing order, and an integer `k`, find the `kth` positive integer that is missing from this array.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: arr = [2,3,4,7,11], k = 5
Output: 9
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [1,5,6,8,9,10,12,...]. The 5th missing positive integer is 9.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: arr = [1,2,3,4], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: The missing positive integers are [5,6,7,...]. The 2nd missing positive integer is 6.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the maximum length of the array `arr`?
2. What are the constraints on the elements of `arr`? (e.g., if they can have duplicates, etc.)
3. What is the range of the integer `k`?

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Start with a counter, `missing_count`, to keep track of the number of missing integers.
   - Initialize a pointer, `index`, to traverse the array.

2. **Iteration:**
   - Iterate through numbers starting from 1.
   - Check if the current number is present in the array.
   - If it is not present, increase the `missing_count`.
   - Stop if `missing_count` equals `k`.

3. **Return:**
   - Return the current number as it represents the `k`th missing positive integer.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is O(n + k) where `n` is the length of the array. This is because in the worst case, we might need to iterate through all numbers till we find the `k`th missing number, checking each against the array.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int findKthPositive(int[] arr, int k) {
        int missing_count = 0;
        int current_number = 1;
        int index = 0;

        while (missing_count < k) {
            // Check if current_number is missing in the array
            if (index < arr.length && arr[index] == current_number) {
                index++;
            } else {
                missing_count++;
            }

            // Check if the current number is the kth missing number
            if (missing_count == k) {
                return current_number;
            }

            current_number++;
        }

        // As a safety return, although theoretically we should never reach here
        return -1;
    }
}
```

This code takes into account the given array and checks every integer starting from 1 to find the `kth` missing positive integer efficiently. If the logic proceeds logically, it ensures that `k` missing elements are calculated and returned.
