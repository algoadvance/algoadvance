[Leetcode 1191. K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1191)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `arr` and an integer `k`, you need to find the maximum possible sum of a subarray of the array formed by concatenating `arr` `k` times. The result should be modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the size of `arr` and the value of `k`?**
    - Typically, constraints might be something like `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5` and `1 <= k <= 10^5`.
2. **What are the constraints on the elements of `arr`?**
    - Elements of `arr` should be within `-10^4 <= arr[i] <= 10^4`.
3. **Are there guaranteed to be subarrays that have a positive sum?**
    - No guarantees, so we need to consider subarrays with negative sums as well.

### Strategy
The solution hinges on a few observations:
1. **Kadane's Algorithm**: We can use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum in a single array.
2. **Handling Concatenation**:
    - If `k == 1`, then this is just a standard maximum subarray problem.
    - If `k > 1`, there are multiple scenarios:
        1. The sum of the array might be positive, indicating potential additional gains from concatenation.
        2. When `k` is large, we need to consider the maximum subarray sum that can span over multiple copies.
    - We need to consider:
        - Maximum subarray sum of one array.
        - Maximum subarray sum of two concatenated arrays to catch cross-boundary sums.
        - If the array sum is positive and `k > 2`, we can add the sum of the middle `(k-2)` arrays.

### Code Implementation
Here's how you can implement the solution in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int kConcatenationMaxSum(int[] arr, int k) {
        final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;
        long maxSumOne = kadane(arr);
        long currentSum = 0;
        long totalSum = 0;
        for (int num : arr) {
            totalSum += num;
        }
        
        if (k == 1) {
            return (int) (maxSumOne % MOD);
        }

        long maxSumTwo = kadaneTwoConcatenated(arr);
        
        if (totalSum > 0) {
            return (int) Math.max(maxSumTwo, (maxSumTwo + totalSum * (k - 2)) % MOD);
        } else {
            return (int) (Math.max(maxSumOne, maxSumTwo) % MOD);
        }
    }

    private long kadane(int[] arr) {
        long maxSoFar = 0;
        long maxEndingHere = 0;
        for (int num : arr) {
            maxEndingHere = Math.max(maxEndingHere + num, num);
            maxSoFar = Math.max(maxSoFar, maxEndingHere);
        }
        return maxSoFar;
    }

    private long kadaneTwoConcatenated(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        long maxSoFar = 0;
        long maxEndingHere = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
            int num = arr[i % n];
            maxEndingHere = Math.max(maxEndingHere + num, num);
            maxSoFar = Math.max(maxSoFar, maxEndingHere);
        }
        return maxSoFar;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Kadane's algorithm runs in O(n) time where `n` is the length of the array.
- The combined complexity:
  - maxSumOne and total sum calculation runs in O(n).
  - kadaneTwoConcatenated runs in O(2n), which is essentially O(n).

Thus, the time complexity is dominated by O(n), making it efficient in practice.
