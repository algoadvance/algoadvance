[Leetcode 700. Search in a Binary Search Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l700)
### Problem Statement
You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer `val`. Find the node in the BST that the node's value equals `val` and return the subtree rooted with that node. If such a node does not exist, return `null`.

#### Example:
```plain
Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 2
Output: [2,1,3]

Input: root = [4,2,7,1,3], val = 5
Output: []
```

#### Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 5000]`.
- `1 <= Node.val <= 10^7`
- `root` is a binary search tree.
- `1 <= val <= 10^7`

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the BST contain duplicate values?
   - No, it's guaranteed by the problem constraints.

2. What should be the output format if the node is found?
   - Return the subtree rooted at the found node.

3. What should be returned if the node is not found?
   - Return `null`.

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we can leverage the properties of a Binary Search Tree (BST):
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value.

To search for a value in a BST:
1. Start at the root node.
2. Compare the value to be found (`val`) with the value of the current node:
   - If `val` is equal to the node's value, return the current node.
   - If `val` is less than the node's value, search in the left subtree.
   - If `val` is greater than the node's value, search in the right subtree.

This approach results in a recursive or iterative search with a time complexity of O(h), where h is the height of the tree. In the worst case, for a completely unbalanced tree, it will be O(n).

### Time Complexity
- Best Case: O(log n), for a balanced BST.
- Worst Case: O(n), for a completely unbalanced BST.

### Code
Here is the implementation of the solution in Java:

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public TreeNode searchBST(TreeNode root, int val) {
        // Base case: root is null or root's value is the one we're looking for
        if (root == null || root.val == val) {
            return root;
        }
        
        // If `val` is less than the root's value, search in the left subtree
        if (val < root.val) {
            return searchBST(root.left, val);
        }
        
        // If `val` is greater than the root's value, search in the right subtree
        return searchBST(root.right, val);
    }
}
```

This implementation uses recursion to traverse the BST and find the node with the given value. If the node is found, it returns the subtree rooted at that node; otherwise, it returns `null`.
