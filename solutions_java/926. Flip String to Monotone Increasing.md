[Leetcode 926. Flip String to Monotone Increasing full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l926)
### Problem Statement:

A binary string is monotone increasing if it consists of some number of `0`s (possibly none), followed by some number of `1`s (also possibly none). You are given a binary string `s`. You can flip `s[i]` (change `0` to `1` or vice versa) as many times as you want.

Return the minimum number of flips to make `s` monotone increasing.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input constraints:** What is the length range of the binary string `s`?
   - **Answer:** The length of `s` can be from `1` to `10^5`.

2. **Character constraints:** Does the string contain only binary digits (`0` and `1`)?
   - **Answer:** Yes, the string contains only `0`s and `1`s.

3. **Output:** What should be returned?
   - **Answer:** Return the minimum number of flips required to make the binary string `s` monotone increasing.

4. **Edge Cases:** What if the string `s` is already monotone increasing?
   - **Answer:** If `s` is already monotone increasing, the minimum number of flips required is `0`.

### Strategy:

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a dynamic programming approach. We maintain two counts:
- `costToKeep0`: Minimum flips required to maintain the string end state with `0` up to current position.
- `costToKeep1`: Minimum flips required to maintain the string end state with `1` up to current position.

We iterate over the string and update these costs based on the current character and previously computed costs.

### Steps:
1. Initialize `costToKeep0` and `costToKeep1`.
2. Iterate through each character in the string.
3. Update the costs based on whether the current character is `0` or `1`.
4. The final minimum of `costToKeep0` and `costToKeep1` will give the required result.

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minFlipsMonoIncr(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        
        int costToKeep0 = 0;  // Initially, no cost for keeping trailing 0's
        int costToKeep1 = 0;  // Initially, no cost for keeping trailing 1's
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            
            // For updating costToKeep0: If we want the end to be a 0, we can't convert this 0
            // So, if it is already 0 we do nothing, if it's a 1 it needs to be flipped to 0.
            int newCostToKeep0 = costToKeep0 + (c == '1' ? 1 : 0);
            
            // For updating costToKeep1: We have two choices for the current position to end in 1:
            // 1. If the current position is 1, it remains unchanged
            // 2. If the current position is 0, we flip it to 1
            // The overall min cost would be what it costs keeping 0 before this plus flip 0 to 1
            // or keeping 1 before and this character remains 1
            int newCostToKeep1 = Math.min(costToKeep0, costToKeep1) + (c == '0' ? 1 : 0);
            
            // Update the costs for the next iteration
            costToKeep0 = newCostToKeep0;
            costToKeep1 = newCostToKeep1;
        }
        
        // The answer will be the minimum of both cost as either can be candidates for valid end states
        return Math.min(costToKeep0, costToKeep1);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the string `s` since we only traverse the string once.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This solution ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum number of flips needed to make the binary string monotone increasing.
