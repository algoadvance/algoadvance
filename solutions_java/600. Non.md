## Problem Statement

Given a positive integer `n`, return the number of positive integers less than or equal to `n` that do not have consecutive ones in their binary representation.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**: What is the maximum value for `n`?
   - Typically, constraints will be specified in the problem description. If not, we assume a reasonable upper bound for the purpose of solving the problem.

2. **Output**: Should the function return the count of integers or at least print them?
   - Based on the problem statement, the function should return the count.

3. **Edge Cases**: How to handle the smallest possible `n` (e.g., `n = 1`)? Should `n = 0` be considered?
   - The problem states "positive integer `n`", therefore `n` cannot be zero or negative.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use Dynamic Programming (DP) to avoid directly checking each number up to `n`, which would be inefficient.

### Approach

1. **Binary Representation**: Observe the binary representation of numbers. We are specifically interested in avoiding consecutive ones (`11`).

2. **DP Arrays**: Create two DP arrays, `zero` and `one`, where:
   - `zero[i]` represents the number of valid binary strings of length `i` that end in `0`.
   - `one[i]` represents the number of valid binary strings of length `i` that end in `1`.

3. **Transitions**:
   - `zero[i]` can be formed by appending `0` to all valid strings of length `i-1`.
   - `one[i]` can be formed by appending `1` to all valid strings of length `i-1` ending in `0`.

4. **Result Calculation**: The sum of `zero` and `one` for all lengths gives us the valid counts, and we relate this by truncating it to the length of the binary representation of `n`.

5. **Bitwise Checking**: Traverse the binary representation of `n` to ensure no transitions violate the rule of consecutive `1`s.

### Code Implementation

```java
public class NonNegativeIntegersWithoutConsecutiveOnes {
    public int findIntegers(int n) {
        // Edge case
        if (n == 0) return 1;

        // Binary length of `n`
        String binaryStr = Integer.toBinaryString(n);
        int k = binaryStr.length();

        // DP arrays
        int[] zero = new int[k+1];
        int[] one = new int[k+1];

        // Base cases
        zero[1] = 1;
        one[1] = 1;

        // Populate the DP arrays
        for (int i = 2; i <= k; i++) {
            zero[i] = zero[i - 1] + one[i - 1];
            one[i] = zero[i - 1];
        }

        // Total valid binary strings of length `k`
        int totalValid = zero[k] + one[k];

        // To ensure we count only numbers <= n
        for (int i = 0; i < k - 1; i++) {
            if (binaryStr.charAt(i) == '1' && binaryStr.charAt(i + 1) == '1') {
                break;
            }
            if (binaryStr.charAt(i) == '0' && binaryStr.charAt(i + 1) == '0') {
                totalValid -= one[k - i - 1];
            }
        }

        return totalValid;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NonNegativeIntegersWithoutConsecutiveOnes solution = new NonNegativeIntegersWithoutConsecutiveOnes();
        System.out.println(solution.findIntegers(5)); // Output should be 5
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(k)`, where `k` is the number of bits in the binary representation of `n`. We use simple array operations and bit checking, each taking constant time per bit.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(k)` due to the DP arrays storing counts of valid strings for each length up to `k`.

This solution efficiently counts non-negative integers without consecutive ones based on a dynamic programming approach tailored to binary strings.
