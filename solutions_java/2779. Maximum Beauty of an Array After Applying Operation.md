### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 2779: Maximum Beauty of an Array After Applying Operation

Given an array of integers `nums` of length `n`. You have to choose at most one subarray of length `k` and increase every integer in that subarray by any integer you choose. Your task is to calculate the maximum possible beauty of the array after applying the operation.

The beauty of the array is defined as the sum of the array elements.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are there any constraints on the values of the integers in the array (e.g., negative integers, very large integers)?
2. Is `k` guaranteed to be less than or equal to `n`?
3. Should we assume that after choosing one subarray of length `k`, the rest of the array remains unchanged?

### Strategy

We need to find the subarray of length `k` that will maximize the sum of the array after incrementing its elements. Here is the strategy to achieve this:

1. **Initial Sum Calculation**: Compute the sum of the entire initial array.
2. **Sliding Window Technique**: Use the sliding window technique to find the sum of all subarrays of length `k`.
3. **Maximize the Sum**: For each subarray, calculate the potential increment that could be added to the beauty of the array by increasing each element in the subarray. Track the maximum increment possible.
4. **Result Calculation**: The maximum beauty of the array after applying the operation is the initial sum plus the maximum increment found.

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int maximumBeauty(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int initialSum = 0;
        int maxIncrement = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        // Calculate the initial sum of the array
        for (int num : nums) {
            initialSum += num;
        }

        // Calculate the maximum potential increase using sliding window
        int currentWindowSum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            currentWindowSum += nums[i];
        }
        maxIncrement = Math.max(maxIncrement, k * (nums[0] + 1) - currentWindowSum);

        for (int i = k; i < n; i++) {
            currentWindowSum = currentWindowSum - nums[i - k] + nums[i];
            maxIncrement = Math.max(maxIncrement, k * (nums[i - k + 1] + 1) - currentWindowSum);
        }

        // Return the maximum beauty
        return initialSum + maxIncrement;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initial Sum Calculation**: \(O(n)\)
- **Sliding Window Technique**: \(O(n)\)
- **Overall Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)

This solution is efficient with a linear time complexity, which ensures it can handle large inputs within feasible execution time. The sliding window technique ensures that we only pass through the array a couple of times, maintaining optimal performance.
