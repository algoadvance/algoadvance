[Leetcode 139. Word Break](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l139)
### Problem Statement

The "Word Break" problem can be found on LeetCode. The problem is defined as follows:

Given a string `s` and a dictionary of strings `wordDict`, return `true` if `s` can be segmented into a space-separated sequence of one or more dictionary words.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "leetcode", wordDict = ["leet","code"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "leetcode" can be segmented as "leet code".
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "applepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen"]
Output: true
Explanation: Return true because "applepenapple" can be segmented as "apple pen apple".
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
Output: false
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the dictionary contain duplicate words?
   - **A:** Typically, dictionaries do not contain duplicates, but we should handle this case gracefully (e.g., by using a `Set`).

2. **Q:** Are all characters in the input string `s` lowercase letters?
   - **A:** Yes, according to the problem statement on LeetCode.

3. **Q:** Can the wordDict be empty?
   - **A:** Yes, and if it is empty, you should immediately return `false` unless the string `s` is also empty.

4. **Q:** What are the length constraints on `s` and `wordDict`?
   - **A:** The length of `s` is between 1 and 300, and wordDict can have up to 1,000 words, each with maximum length of 20.

### Strategy

The key to solving this problem efficiently is to use Dynamic Programming (DP). Here is the approach:

1. **DP Array:** Create a boolean array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents whether the substring `s[0:i]` can be segmented into one or more words in the dictionary.
2. **Initialization:** Set `dp[0] = true` because an empty string can always be segmented.
3. **Iteration:** For each position `i` in `s` and each position `j` before `i`, check if the substring `s[j:i]` is in the word dictionary and if `dp[j]` is `true`.
4. **Result:** The value of `dp[s.length()]` will give the answer to the problem.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public boolean wordBreak(String s, List<String> wordDict) {
        Set<String> wordSet = new HashSet<>(wordDict); // Convert list to set for O(1) lookup
        boolean[] dp = new boolean[s.length() + 1];
        dp[0] = true; // Base case: an empty string can be segmented

        for (int i = 1; i <= s.length(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (dp[j] && wordSet.contains(s.substring(j, i))) {
                    dp[i] = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[s.length()];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2), where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because for each position `i` in the string, we need to check every previous position `j`.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n + m), where `n` is the length of the string `s` (for the DP array) and `m` is the size of the word dictionary (for storing words in a set).

This approach ensures that we efficiently check all possible segmentations of the string `s` using the words in `wordDict`.
