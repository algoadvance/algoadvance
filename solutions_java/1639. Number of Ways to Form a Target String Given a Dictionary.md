[Leetcode 1639. Number of Ways to Form a Target String Given a Dictionary](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1639)
### Problem Statement
Given a list of words, each word having the same length, and a target string, determine the number of ways to form the target string by choosing one letter from one of the words in each step. Each letter must be chosen from a different word, but the chosen letters do not need to be in consecutive order in the words.

You must return the number of ways to form the target string modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Example
**Input:**
```plaintext
words = ["acca","bbbb","caca"]
target = "aba"
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
6
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the length of `words` or `target`?
   **A:** `words` array length is up to 1,000 and each word length is also up to 1,000. The `target` length is up to 100.
   
2. **Q:** What characters do the strings contain?
   **A:** The strings contain lowercase English letters only.

3. **Q:** Is there a specific performance requirement?
   **A:** The solution should be efficient, considering the upper bounds of the input sizes.

### Strategy
1. **Count Matrix:** First, we create a matrix where `count[i][c]` represents the number of words having the character `c` at position `i`.
2. **DP Array:** Use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways to form each prefix of the target string up to length `j` using words up to length `i`.
   - `dp[j]` will represent the number of ways to form the target string `target[0:j+1]`.
   - Iterate through each position of the words to update our dp array accordingly.

### Code
Here is the code to solve the problem:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class FormTargetString {
    private static final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;

    public int numWays(String[] words, String target) {
        int wordLen = words[0].length();
        int targetLen = target.length();

        // Count matrix to count occurrences of each char at each position in words
        int[][] count = new int[wordLen][26];
        for (String word : words) {
            for (int i = 0; i < wordLen; i++) {
                count[i][word.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
            }
        }

        // DP array initialization
        long[] dp = new long[targetLen + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;

        // Iterate through each character position in words
        for (int i = 0; i < wordLen; i++) {
            // Backing up the previous dp to avoid overwriting during the update
            for (int j = targetLen - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                char tgtChar = target.charAt(j);
                int charCountInPos = count[i][tgtChar - 'a'];
                dp[j + 1] = (dp[j + 1] + dp[j] * charCountInPos) % MOD;
            }
        }

        return (int) dp[targetLen];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FormTargetString sol = new FormTargetString();
        String[] words = {"acca", "bbbb", "caca"};
        String target = "aba";
        System.out.println(sol.numWays(words, target)); // Output: 6
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Count Matrix Construction:** \(O(m \times n)\)
- **DP Update:** \(O(m \times t)\)

Where:
- \(m\) is the length of each word,
- \(n\) is the number of words,
- \(t\) is the length of the target string.

Overall time complexity is \(O(m \times (n + t))\), which should be efficient given the problem constraints.
