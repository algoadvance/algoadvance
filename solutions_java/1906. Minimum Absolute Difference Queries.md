[Leetcode 1906. Minimum Absolute Difference Queries](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1906)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` and an array `queries` where `queries[i] = [li, ri]`. For each query `i`, compute the minimum absolute difference between any two elements in the subarray `nums[li...ri]` (both inclusive) and return an array of the answers.

The minimum absolute difference of a subarray is defined as the minimum absolute difference between any two elements in this subarray (with at least two elements).

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the elements of `nums` be negative?**
   - Yes, `nums` can contain negative numbers.
  
2. **What is the range of `nums` and `queries`?**
   - `nums` and `queries` lengths can be up to `10^5`, and the elements of `nums` can be in the range `[-10^5, 10^5]`.

3. **Is the array sorted beforehand?**
   - No, the array `nums` is not necessarily sorted.

4. **Are `li` and `ri` inclusive?**
   - Yes, both `li` and `ri` are inclusive.

5. **Is there a constraint on the subarray size?**
   - No, but the subarray must contain at least two elements to define a difference.

### Strategy
1. **Subarray Extraction and Sorting:**
    - Extract the subarray defined by each query.
    - Sort the subarray to facilitate finding the minimum absolute difference.

2. **Calculate Differences:**
    - Compute the absolute differences between every two consecutive elements in the sorted subarray.
    - Record the minimum absolute difference found.

3. **Optimization:**
    - For each subarray, sorting takes \(O(n \log n)\), and computing differences takes \(O(n)\).
    - We can use prefix sums or segment trees for more efficient range queries, but sorting followed by linear scan works reasonably well given typical constraints.

### Code
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MinimumAbsoluteDifferenceQueries {
    
    public int[] minDifference(int[] nums, int[][] queries) {
        int[] result = new int[queries.length];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < queries.length; i++) {
            int l = queries[i][0];
            int r = queries[i][1];
            
            // Extract the subarray nums[l..r] and sort it
            int[] subarray = Arrays.copyOfRange(nums, l, r + 1);
            Arrays.sort(subarray);
            
            // Compute the minimum absolute difference in the sorted subarray
            int minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            for (int j = 1; j < subarray.length; j++) {
                minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, subarray[j] - subarray[j - 1]);
            }
            
            result[i] = minDiff;
        }
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumAbsoluteDifferenceQueries madq = new MinimumAbsoluteDifferenceQueries();
        int[] nums = {1, 3, 4, 8, 6};
        int[][] queries = {{0, 1}, {1, 3}, {2, 4}};
        
        int[] result = madq.minDifference(nums, queries);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(result)); // Output: [2, 1, 2]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Extracting and Sorting Subarray:**
  - Extracting subarray: \(O(r - l + 1)\)
  - Sorting subarray: \(O((r - l + 1) \log (r - l + 1))\)
- **Calculating the Minimum Difference:** \(O(r - l)\)

Each query has a time complexity of \(O((r - l + 1) \log (r - l + 1))\). Given that this happens for \(Q\) queries, the total time complexity is \(O(Q \times n \log n)\) in the worst case where \(l = 0\) and \(r = n-1\) for each query, making it less practical for very large inputs.
