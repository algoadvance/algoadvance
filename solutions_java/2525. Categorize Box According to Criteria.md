[Leetcode 2525. Categorize Box According to Criteria](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2525)
### Problem Statement:

You are given the dimensions of a box (length, width, height) and the weight of the box. The box needs to be categorized based on the following criteria:

1. **Bulky**: A box is bulky if any of its dimensions is greater than or equal to `10^4` units or its volume is greater than or equal to `10^9` cubic units.
2. **Heavy**: A box is heavy if its weight is greater than or equal to `100` units.
3. **Neither**: A box that is neither bulky nor heavy should be categorized as "Neither".
4. **Both**: A box that is both bulky and heavy should be categorized as "Both".

Your task is to write a function that takes the dimensions and weight of the box and returns the appropriate category.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Range**: What are the ranges for the dimensions and weight of the box?
    - **Assumption**: The dimensions and weight of the box are positive integers within a reasonable range (e.g., within a 32-bit signed integer).

2. **Volume Calculation**: Do we need to calculate the volume using all three dimensions?
    - **Yes**, the volume is calculated as `length * width * height`.

### Strategy:
1. **Bulky Criteria**: Check if any of the dimensions is `>= 10^4` or if the volume of the box `>= 10^9`.
2. **Heavy Criteria**: Check if the weight `>= 100`.
3. **Both Criteria**: If the box meets both the bulky and heavy criteria, it's categorized as "Both".
4. **Neither Criteria**: If the box doesn't meet either bulky or heavy criteria, it's categorized as "Neither".

### Code:
```java
public class BoxCategorizer {
    public String categorizeBox(int length, int width, int height, int weight) {
        boolean isBulky = length >= 10000 || width >= 10000 || height >= 10000 || ((long)length * width * height >= 1000000000);
        boolean isHeavy = weight >= 100;
        
        if (isBulky && isHeavy) {
            return "Both";
        } else if (isBulky) {
            return "Bulky";
        } else if (isHeavy) {
            return "Heavy";
        } else {
            return "Neither";
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BoxCategorizer bc = new BoxCategorizer();
        System.out.println(bc.categorizeBox(10000, 5000, 2000, 30)); // Output: Bulky
        System.out.println(bc.categorizeBox(5000, 5000, 1000, 120)); // Output: Heavy
        System.out.println(bc.categorizeBox(10000, 5000, 2000, 120)); // Output: Both
        System.out.println(bc.categorizeBox(5, 5, 5, 5)); // Output: Neither
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(1)** because the operations performed (comparisons and multiplications) are constant-time operations and do not depend on the input size. 

This simple and efficient approach fulfills the requirements of categorizing the box based on the given criteria.
