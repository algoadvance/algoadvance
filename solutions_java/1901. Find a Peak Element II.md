[Leetcode 1901. Find a Peak Element II full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1901)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `mat` where `mat[i][j]` is greater than or equal to its four possible neighbors (left, right, top, bottom). An element in the matrix is a peak if it is strictly greater than all of its neighbors. A matrix can have multiple peak elements. Find any peak element `mat[i][j]` and return the indices of that peak element.

You may assume that the matrix is "1-indexed," which means that the outer boundaries are strictly smaller than any element in the matrix itself.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the constraints on `m` and `n` (the dimensions of the matrix)?
     - The dimensions of the matrix (m and n) are in the range 1 to 500.
   - Are there any constraints on the values within the matrix?
     - The values in the matrix fall within a typical integer range.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the matrix has only one element, should we consider it a peak?
     - Yes, since it would be greater than its non-existent neighbors.

### Strategy

1. **Binary Search Approach:**
   - We can use a modified binary search to efficiently find a peak element in this matrix.
   - The idea is to reduce the dimension of the problem iteratively, focusing on rows or columns. 
   - In each step, find the maximum in a middle row or middle column and compare it with neighbors to decide the direction of the search.

2. **Algorithm Steps:**
   1. Start with the middle column and find the global maximum in that column.
   2. Compare the maximum element with its neighbors (left and right).
   3. If the maximum element is larger than its neighbors, it is a peak.
   4. If not, move left or right based on the comparison and repeat the process with the new sub-matrix.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] findPeakGrid(int[][] mat) {
        int m = mat.length;
        int n = mat[0].length;
        
        int left = 0;
        int right = n - 1;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            int midCol = left + (right - left) / 2;
            int maxRow = 0;

            // Find index of maximum element in the middle column
            for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
                if (mat[i][midCol] > mat[maxRow][midCol]) {
                    maxRow = i;
                }
            }
            
            boolean leftIsBig = (midCol - 1 >= left && mat[maxRow][midCol - 1] > mat[maxRow][midCol]);
            boolean rightIsBig = (midCol + 1 <= right && mat[maxRow][midCol + 1] > mat[maxRow][midCol]);

            // Check if the found maximum is a peak
            if (!leftIsBig && !rightIsBig) {
                return new int[]{maxRow, midCol};
            } else if (leftIsBig) {
                right = midCol - 1;
            } else {
                left = midCol + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return new int[]{-1, -1}; // This should never be reached
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(m log n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. The algorithm reduces the search space by half in each step (log n) and scans one column (m) in each iteration.

- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we are using a constant amount of extra space.
