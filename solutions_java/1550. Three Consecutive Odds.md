[Leetcode 1550. Three Consecutive Odds](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1550)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `arr`, return `true` if there are three consecutive odd numbers in the array. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the size range of the array `arr`?
   - What range of integers does the array `arr` contain?

2. **Behavioral Questions:**
   - Should the function handle an empty array or arrays with less than three elements?

Based on the standard problem statement, we'll assume:
- The array size can be anything within the usual constraints of Java's array size.
- The integers can be any valid Java integer values.

### Code
Here is the Java code to solve the problem:

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean threeConsecutiveOdds(int[] arr) {
        int consecutiveOdds = 0;
        
        for (int num : arr) {
            if (num % 2 != 0) {
                consecutiveOdds++;
                if (consecutiveOdds == 3) {
                    return true;
                }
            } else {
                consecutiveOdds = 0;
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        
        int[] arr1 = {2, 6, 4, 1};        // false
        int[] arr2 = {1, 3, 5, 7};        // true
        int[] arr3 = {1, 2, 3, 5, 7};     // false
        int[] arr4 = {1, 3, 5};           // true
        int[] arr5 = {};                  // false
        
        System.out.println(sol.threeConsecutiveOdds(arr1));
        System.out.println(sol.threeConsecutiveOdds(arr2));
        System.out.println(sol.threeConsecutiveOdds(arr3));
        System.out.println(sol.threeConsecutiveOdds(arr4));
        System.out.println(sol.threeConsecutiveOdds(arr5));
    }
}
```

### Strategy
1. Initialize a counter `consecutiveOdds` to keep track of consecutive odd numbers.
2. Iterate over each element in the array:
   - If the current element is odd (`num % 2 != 0`), increment the counter.
   - If the counter reaches 3, return `true`.
   - If the current element is even, reset the counter to 0.
3. If the loop completes without finding three consecutive odd numbers, return `false`.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array. This is because we need to traverse the array once to check for the condition. The space complexity is `O(1)` since we are only using a few fixed-size variables regardless of the array size.
