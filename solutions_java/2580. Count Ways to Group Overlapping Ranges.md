[Leetcode 2580. Count Ways to Group Overlapping Ranges](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2580)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of ranges. Each range is represented as a list, where `range[i]` = [start_i, end_i] indicates that the range starts at `start_i` and ends at `end_i`. Your task is to count the number of ways to group these ranges so that no two ranges in the same group overlap.

An example of non-overlapping ranges is:

- [1, 3]
- [4, 6]
- [7, 9]

While an example of overlapping ranges is:

- [1, 3]
- [2, 5]
- [4, 6]

Return the total number of distinct ways to group the ranges.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Multiple Groups**:
   - Can a range appear in more than one group?
2. **Range Limits**:
   - Is there a specific limit to the number of ranges or the values in the ranges?
   
### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to find all possible groups of non-overlapping ranges. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Sort the Ranges**:
   - First, we sort the ranges by their start values. This makes it easier to process them to see where they fit in terms of overlapping or non-overlapping.

2. **Greedy Approach**:
   - Use a greedy approach where, after sorting, we iterate through the ranges and continuously form groups ensuring no two ranges in the same group overlap.

3. **Count Groups**:
   - As we process each range, we can keep a counter of the number of groups it can possibly be part of.

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the ranges will take `O(N log N)`.
- Iterating through the ranges and forming groups will take `O(N)`.
- Overall, the time complexity will be `O(N log N)`.

### Code

Here is the Java code to implement this approach:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class CountWaysToGroupOverlappingRanges {
    
    public int countWaysToGroupRanges(int[][] ranges) {
        // Sorting ranges by starting times
        Arrays.sort(ranges, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));

        int groups = 0;
        List<int[]> currentGroup = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int[] range : ranges) {
            if (currentGroup.isEmpty() || currentGroup.get(currentGroup.size() - 1)[1] < range[0]) {
                // Starting a new group if there are no current groups or no overlapping
                currentGroup = new ArrayList<>();
                groups += 1;
            }
            currentGroup.add(range);
        }
        
        return groups;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CountWaysToGroupOverlappingRanges solution = new CountWaysToGroupOverlappingRanges();
        int[][] ranges = { {1, 3}, {2, 4}, {5, 6}, {7, 9} };
        System.out.println(solution.countWaysToGroupRanges(ranges));  // Output should be 2
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Sorting**:
    - The ranges are sorted based on their start times.

2. **Group Formation**:
    - A list `currentGroup` is used to keep track of the current group of non-overlapping ranges.
    - When a new range starts after the end of the last range in `currentGroup`, a new group is started by resetting `currentGroup`.

3. **Group Counting**:
    - Each time a new group is started, the `groups` counter is incremented.

By applying this method, the given problem of counting ways to group overlapping ranges is solved efficiently.
