[Leetcode 3144. Minimum Substring Partition of Equal Character Frequency](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3144)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, partition the string into one or more substrings such that the characters in each substring appear the same number of times. Return the minimum number of substrings in such a partition.

**Example:**
- Input: `s = "aabb"`
- Output: 2
- Explanation: We can partition "aabb" into ["aa", "bb"].

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What characters does the string `s` contain?**
   - The string `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
  
2. **What is the maximum length of the string `s`?**
   - The length of the string `s` can be up to \(10^4\).

3. **Can the string be empty?**
   - No, the input string `s` is guaranteed to be non-empty.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the string and track the frequency of each character within a current partition.

1. **Use a HashMap (or array) to count frequency:**
   - As we iterate over the string, keep track of character frequencies.
  
2. **Partition Points:**
   - When moving to the next character, check if moving this character deviates from having all characters with the same frequency in the current partition. If it does, cut off the current partition and start a new one.
  
3. **Counting Partitions:**
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the number of partitions.
   - Every time we encounter a character that would break the equal frequency condition in the current partition, increase the partition count and reset frequency tracking for the new partition.

### Implementation
Let's implement the solution in Java:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class MinimumSubstringPartition {
    public int minSubstringPartition(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.length() == 0) return 0;
        int n = s.length();
        
        // A variable to track the number of partitions.
        int partitions = 1;
        
        // HashMap to store the frequency of characters in the current partition.
        Map<Character, Integer> freqMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            
            // Update current partition frequency.
            freqMap.put(c, freqMap.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
            
            // Expected frequency in current substring.
            int expectedFrequency = freqMap.get(s.charAt(i));
            
            // Check if current character breaks the equal frequency condition.
            boolean partitionNeeded = false;
            for (int count : freqMap.values()) {
                if (count != expectedFrequency) {
                    partitionNeeded = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            
            if (partitionNeeded) {
                // Reset for the next partition.
                partitions++;
                freqMap.clear();
                freqMap.put(c, 1);
            }
        }
        
        return partitions;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumSubstringPartition solution = new MinimumSubstringPartition();
        String s = "aabb";
        System.out.println("Minimum partitions: " + solution.minSubstringPartition(s)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`. We iterate through the string once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since the size of the HashMap (or frequency array) is bounded by the fixed number of possible characters (26 for lowercase English letters).

This solution efficiently partitions the string while ensuring that each character in the partition appears the same number of times.
