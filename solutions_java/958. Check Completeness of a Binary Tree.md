### Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 958: Check Completeness of a Binary Tree

Given the `root` of a binary tree, determine if it is a complete binary tree.

In a complete binary tree, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2^h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format**:
   - What is the definition of the binary tree node?
   - How do we represent a binary tree in the problem?

   *Answer*: The binary tree node is represented by the following class:
   ```java
   public class TreeNode {
       int val;
       TreeNode left;
       TreeNode right;
       TreeNode() {}
       TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
       TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
           this.val = val;
           this.left = left;
           this.right = right;
       }
   }
   ```
   
2. **Function Signature**:
   - What is the expected function signature for this problem?

   *Answer*: 
   ```java
   public boolean isCompleteTree(TreeNode root);
   ```

3. **Constraints**:
   - Are there any constraints on the number of nodes or the values of the nodes?
   - Can the binary tree be empty?

   *Answer*: The constraints aren't explicitly mentioned, but it's safe to assume typical size constraints (e.g., `1 <= number of nodes <= 1000`).

### Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - We will traverse the tree level by level using a queue.
   - Add the root to the queue.
   - For each node, if it exists, add its children to the queue.
   - If a null node is encountered, all subsequent nodes must be null for the tree to be complete.
   - If any non-null node is encountered after a null node, the tree is not complete.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we visit each node once.

- **Space Complexity**: O(n), since in the worst case, we might have to store all the nodes at a certain level in the queue.

### Code

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public class Solution {
    public boolean isCompleteTree(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return true;
        
        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(root);
        boolean seenNull = false;
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            TreeNode current = queue.poll();
            
            if (current == null) {
                seenNull = true;
            } else {
                if (seenNull) 
                    return false;
                queue.add(current.left);
                queue.add(current.right);
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

### Summary

In this solution, we used a BFS approach to ensure that all nodes are as left as possible and no non-null nodes appear after a null node. This method ensures that the tree is checked for completeness efficiently. This approach is optimal because it allows us to verify the structure level by level using a queue.
