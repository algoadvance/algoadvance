[Leetcode 1835. Find XOR Sum of All Pairs Bitwise AND](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1835)
### Problem Statement

Given two integer arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, the XOR sum of all pairs bitwise AND is defined as the XOR of the bitwise AND results of all possible pairs (arr1[i], arr2[j]) for all valid i and j. More formally, if `n` is the length of `arr1` and `m` is the length of `arr2`, you need to find the value of:

\[ \bigoplus_{i=0}^{n-1} \bigoplus_{j=0}^{m-1} (arr1[i] \& arr2[j]) \]

where "\(\&\)" denotes the bitwise AND operator and "\(\bigoplus\)" denotes the XOR operator.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints**: What are the size limits for `arr1` and `arr2`?
2. **Element ranges**: What are the value ranges for the elements in `arr1` and `arr2`?
3. **Output type**: Should the result be a single integer or some other format?

Assuming standard constraints and integer ranges typically posed by LeetCode (e.g., array lengths up to \(10^4\) and elements up to \(10^9\)).

### Strategy

1. **Observation**:
   - The XOR operation is commutative and associative.
   - Bitwise operations on arrays can often be simplified using properties of XOR and AND.

2. **Simplification**:
   - If you consider the AND operation on each bit separately:
     - For every pair `(arr1[i], arr2[j])`, if a bit `k` is set in both `arr1[i]` and `arr2[j]`, it contributes to the final XOR sum.
   - We can compute the contribution of each bit position independently by decomposing the problem using the distributive property of AND over XOR.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Use bitwise manipulation to isolate contributions from each bit and compute the final result.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int getXORSum(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
        int xor1 = 0;
        int xor2 = 0;
        
        // Compute XOR sum of all elements in arr1
        for (int num : arr1) {
            xor1 ^= num;
        }
        
        // Compute XOR sum of all elements in arr2
        for (int num : arr2) {
            xor2 ^= num;
        }
        
        // Return the AND of the two XOR sums
        return xor1 & xor2;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Step-by-step**:
   - First, compute `xor1` which is the XOR sum of all elements in `arr1`.
   - Then, compute `xor2` which is the XOR sum of all elements in `arr2`.
   - Finally, compute `xor1 & xor2`, which gives the desired result based on the simplified property that discussing all pairs.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n + m)\)
  - Computing XOR sum for `arr1` takes \(O(n)\).
  - Computing XOR sum for `arr2` takes \(O(m)\).
  - Performing a bitwise AND operation between two integers takes \(O(1)\).

Thus, the overall complexity is linear relative to the size of the input arrays.
