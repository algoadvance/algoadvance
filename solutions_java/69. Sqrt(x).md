[Leetcode 69. Sqrt(x)](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l69)
### Problem Statement

Given a non-negative integer `x`, compute and return the square root of `x`.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated, and only the integer part of the result is returned.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: x = 4
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: x = 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What is the range of input values?
   - **A:** The input `x` is a non-negative integer. There are no specific constraints, but typically for such problems, the value of `x` can be large, up to \(2^{31} - 1\) (the maximum value for a 32-bit signed integer).

2. **Q:** Should we consider mathematical functions like `Math.sqrt()`?
   - **A:** For learning and interview purposes, it is better to implement the algorithm without using `Math.sqrt()`, as it demonstrates problem-solving skills and understanding of algorithms.

3. **Q:** How do we handle edge cases such as `x = 0` or `x = 1`?
   - **A:** These should be handled specifically. The square root of `0` is `0`, and the square root of `1` is `1`.

### Strategy

We can solve this problem using the Binary Search algorithm:

1. **Initialize:** Start with two pointers, `left = 0` and `right = x`.
2. **Binary Search:** While `left <= right`, calculate the mid-point, `mid = left + (right - left) / 2`.
3. **Check:**
   - If `mid * mid` equals `x`, return `mid`.
   - If `mid * mid` is less than `x`, move `left` to `mid + 1`.
   - If `mid * mid` is greater than `x`, move `right` to `mid - 1`.
4. **Return:** When the loop ends, `right` will be the integer part of the square root.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        if (x < 2) {
            return x;
        }
        
        int left = 0;
        int right = x;
        int result = 0;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            
            if (mid <= x / mid) {
                result = mid;  // mid is a potential answer
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(log x)`, because we are using binary search which divides the range in half for each iteration.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This solution efficiently finds the integer part of the square root using binary search without relying on built-in functions, making it suitable for large input values.
