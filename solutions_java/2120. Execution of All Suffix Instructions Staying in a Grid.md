[Leetcode 2120. Execution of All Suffix Instructions Staying in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2120)
### Problem Statement:
You are given a grid of size `n x n` and given an initial position `(startRow, startCol)` on that grid. The grid is indexed from 0. You are given a string `s` containing instructions where each character corresponds to a movement in one of four cardinal directions ('L', 'R', 'U', 'D'), referring to left, right, up, and down, respectively.

Each move in the string should only be performed if it remains within the bounds of the grid; otherwise, it is ignored.

Return an array of integers where the `i-th` integer represents the number of moves you could execute starting from the initial position and from instruction `s[i]` to the end of `s`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Bounds of the Grid:** What is the range of values for `n`?
   - `1 <= n <= 500`

2. **String Length:** What about the length of the string `s`?
   - `1 <= s.length <= 500`

3. **Initial Position:** Will the initial position `(startRow, startCol)` always be within the bounds `[0, n-1]`?
   - Yes, the initial position will be valid.

### Strategy:
- We iterate through each possible starting point in the string `s`.
- For each starting point, simulate the movements on the grid, counting valid moves until we either hit the boundary of the grid or finish all given moves.
- Store the results for each starting point in an array.

### Code:
```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] executeInstructions(int n, int[] startPos, String s) {
        int len = s.length();
        int[] results = new int[len];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            int steps = 0;
            int currentRow = startPos[0];
            int currentCol = startPos[1];
            
            for (int j = i; j < len; j++) {
                char move = s.charAt(j);
                
                switch (move) {
                    case 'L':
                        currentCol--;
                        break;
                    case 'R':
                        currentCol++;
                        break;
                    case 'U':
                        currentRow--;
                        break;
                    case 'D':
                        currentRow++;
                        break;
                }
                
                // Check if the new position is valid
                if (currentRow >= 0 && currentRow < n && currentCol >= 0 && currentCol < n) {
                    steps++;
                } else {
                    break;
                }
            }
            
            results[i] = steps;
        }
        
        return results;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Outer Loop:** `O(m)` where `m` is the length of the string `s` (checking from each starting index).
- **Inner Loop:** In the worst case, the inner loop runs `O(m)` times for each character `i` since we check from `i` to the end of the string.
- **Total Time Complexity:** `O(m^2)` as for each character we might check movements till the end of string.

The solution is efficient considering the constraints and covers each possible starting point thoroughly.
