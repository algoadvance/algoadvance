[Leetcode 2975. Maximum Square Area by Removing Fences From a Field](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2975)
### Problem Statement:
You are given a rectangular field of dimensions `m x n` which is filled with fences represented by `1`s and empty areas represented by `0`s. You need to find the largest square area such that you can remove some fences to form that square. You are allowed to remove fences (changing `1`s to `0`s) in order to achieve this.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the dimensions limits of `m` and `n`? (e.g., 1 <= m, n <= 1000)

2. **Allowed Operations:**
   - Are we allowed to remove any number of fences, or is there a cost associated?
   
3. **Output:**
   - Should the result be the area of the largest square or just the side length?
   
Assuming from the problem statement:
- The dimensions of the grid are within reasonable limits, making an O(m * n) solution feasible.
- Any number of fence removals are allowed.
- The result should be the area of the largest possible square.

### Strategy:
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to build a 2D `dp` array where `dp[i][j]` represents the side length of the largest square whose bottom-right corner is `(i, j)`.

#### Steps:
1. Initialize a 2D `dp` array of the same dimensions as the field, filled initially with zeros.
2. Iterate through each cell in the grid:
   - If the cell contains a fence (`1`), that cell can potentially become part of a square by 'removing the fence'. Hence, `dp[i][j]` can be updated to extend a square that ends at that cell.
   - If the cell is an empty space (`0`), it naturally contributes to forming a square.
3. For each cell `(i, j)`:
   - If `(i, j)` is not on the border:
     ```
     dp[i][j] = min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1
     ```
     This formula ensures that the current cell extends the smallest possible square ending at `(i, j)` by including the current cell.
4. Keep track of the maximum value in the `dp` array to find the largest square side length, and compute the area from this side length.

5. Return the area of the square.

### Code:
```java
public class MaxSquareAreaRemovingFences {
    public int maximalSquare(int[][] field) {
        if (field == null || field.length == 0 || field[0].length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int m = field.length;
        int n = field[0].length;
        int[][] dp = new int[m][n];
        int maxSideLength = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (field[i][j] == 0 || field[i][j] == 1) { // We treat both '0' and '1' as part of a potentially removable square
                    if (i == 0 || j == 0) {
                        dp[i][j] = 1;
                    } else {
                        dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i-1][j], Math.min(dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1])) + 1;
                    }
                    maxSideLength = Math.max(maxSideLength, dp[i][j]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return maxSideLength * maxSideLength;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaxSquareAreaRemovingFences solver = new MaxSquareAreaRemovingFences();
        int[][] field = {
            {1, 0, 1, 0, 0},
            {1, 0, 1, 1, 1},
            {1, 1, 1, 1, 1},
            {1, 0, 0, 1, 0}
        };
        System.out.println(solver.maximalSquare(field)); // Output should be 9 (3x3 square)
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- The solution involves looping through each cell exactly once, making the time complexity **O(m * n)**, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid.
- Space complexity is also **O(m * n)** due to the additional `dp` array storage.

This solution efficiently computes the largest area of a square by allowing fence removals and utilizes dynamic programming to ensure an optimal approach.
