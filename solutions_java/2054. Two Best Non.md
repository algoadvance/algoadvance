[Leetcode 2054. Two Best Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2054)
Absolutely! Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Problem Statement
Given two arrays `start` and `end`, both of which have the same length `n`. Each pair `(start[i], end[i])` represents an event that starts at time `start[i]` and finishes at time `end[i]`. Additionally, you are given an array `value` which represents the value of attending the event `i`.

You are to find the maximum sum of values of two non-overlapping events. The two events `(start[i], end[i])` and `(start[j], end[j])` are considered non-overlapping if `end[i] < start[j]` or `end[j] < start[i]`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What are the constraints on the size of the arrays?
    - What are the constraints on the values within the arrays?
2. **Output**:
    - Are we guaranteed that there will be at least two non-overlapping events?
3. **Overlap Definition**:
    - Confirming the definition of non-overlapping: `end[i] < start[j]` or `end[j] < start[i]`.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we will use a combination of sorting and dynamic programming:

1. **Sorting**: First, we'll sort the events by their ending times. This helps in efficiently finding the maximum value of non-overlapping events using binary search.
2. **Dynamic Programming**: We'll maintain an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum value we can obtain by attending events from the start up to the `i-th` event (inclusive).
3. **Binary Search**: For each event, we need to find the latest non-overlapping event that ends before the current event starts. This can be efficiently found using binary search.

### Code
Here is the implementation:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int maxTwoEvents(int[][] events) {
        int n = events.length;
        
        // Sort by the ending time
        Arrays.sort(events, (a, b) -> a[1] - b[1]);
        
        // dp[i] will store the maximum value we can obtain from events[0..i]
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        dp[0] = events[0][2];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i-1], events[i][2]);
        }
        
        int maxV = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Binary search to find the latest event that doesn't overlap with event[i]
            int l = 0, r = i - 1, pos = -1;
            while (l <= r) {
                int mid = (l + r) / 2;
                if (events[mid][1] < events[i][0]) {
                    pos = mid;
                    l = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    r = mid - 1;
                }
            }
            
            if (pos != -1) {
                maxV = Math.max(maxV, events[i][2] + dp[pos]);
            } else {
                maxV = Math.max(maxV, events[i][2]);
            }
        }
        
        return maxV;
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Sorting**: We sort events by `end` time.
2. **Dynamic Array**: Maintain a `dp` array to store the maximum value up to each event.
3. **Binary Search**: For each event, find the maximum-valued non-overlapping event using binary search.
4. **Max Value Update**: Calculate the combined value and update the `maxV` accordingly.

### Time Complexity
- Sorting takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- Filling up the `dp` array takes \(O(n)\).
- For each event, performing a binary search takes \(O(\log n)\), leading to an overall time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\).

This approach is efficient and leverages sorting and binary search to ensure that we achieve the solution in logarithmic time for each event.
