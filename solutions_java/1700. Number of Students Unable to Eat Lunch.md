[Leetcode 1700. Number of Students Unable to Eat Lunch](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1700)
### Problem Statement

The problem is defined on LeetCode as follows:

_The school cafeteria offers circular and square sandwiches at lunch break, referred to as 0s and 1s respectively. All students stand in a queue. Each student either prefers square sandwiches or circular sandwiches._

_The number of sandwiches in the cafeteria is equal to the number of students. The sandwiches are placed in a stack. At each step:_

- _If the student at the front of the queue prefers the sandwich on the top of the stack, they will take it and leave the queue._
- _Otherwise, they will leave it and go to the queue's end._

_This continues until none of the queue students want to take the top sandwich and are thus unable to eat._

_You are given two integer arrays `students` and `sandwiches` where `sandwiches[i]` is the type of the i-th sandwich in the stack (i=0 is the top of the stack) and `students[j]` is the preference of the j-th student in the initial queue (j=0 is the front of the queue)._

_Return the number of students that are unable to eat._

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are the students and sandwiches arrays guaranteed to have the same length?
   - **A:** Yes, the problem states that the number of sandwiches is equal to the number of students.

2. **Q:** Can we assume all input values are valid and within the problem's constraints?
   - **A:** Yes, you can assume valid inputs within the described constraints.

3. **Q:** What are the possible values in `students` and `sandwiches` arrays?
   - **A:** Both arrays contain only the integers `0` and `1` representing the types of sandwiches and student preferences.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Count Variables:**
   - We will count the number of `0`s and `1`s in the student's preference list.

2. **Iterate Through Sandwiches:**
   - For each sandwich on top of the stack, check if there's a student to take it based on the counted preferences.
   - If a student takes a sandwich, decrement the respective count.

3. **Stopping Condition:**
   - The iteration stops early if no more students can take the current top sandwich, i.e., when no students of the preferred type are left.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int countStudents(int[] students, int[] sandwiches) {
        int count0 = 0, count1 = 0;
        
        // Count preference of students
        for (int student : students) {
            if (student == 0) count0++;
            else count1++;
        }

        // Iterate through the sandwiches stack.
        for (int sandwich : sandwiches) {
            if (sandwich == 0) {
                if (count0 > 0)
                    count0--;
                else
                    return count1; // no students who prefer 0 left, return remaining students
            } else {
                if (count1 > 0)
                    count1--;
                else
                    return count0; // no students who prefer 1 left, return remaining students
            }
        }

        return 0; // All students could eat
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Counting students' preferences:** O(n), where `n` is the number of students (or sandwiches).
- **Iterating through sandwiches:** O(n), as each sandwich is processed once.

Thus, the total time complexity is **O(n)**.

This solution efficiently uses counting and directly processes the sandwich stack, optimizing for both clarity and performance.
