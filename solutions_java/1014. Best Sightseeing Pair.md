[Leetcode 1014. Best Sightseeing Pair](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1014)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `values` where `values[i]` represents the value of the ith sightseeing spot. Two sightseeing spots `i` and `j` have a distance `j - i` between them.

A sightseeing pair `(i < j)` is defined as the sum of the values at the two sightseeing spots minus the distance between them: `values[i] + values[j] + i - j`.

Return the maximum score of a pair of sightseeing spots.

### Example
```
Input: values = [8,1,5,2,6]
Output: 11
Explanation: i = 0, j = 2 -> values[0] + values[2] + 0 - 2 = 8 + 5 - 2 = 11
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. What is the expected size range of the input array `values`? (This might help in analyzing the time complexity.)
2. Are there any constraints on the values inside the `values` array? For example, can they be negative?
3. Is the output always guaranteed to be non-negative?

Let's answer these questions before moving forward:

1. The length of `values` is at least 2 and up to 50,000.
2. Each value inside the `values` array is between 1 and 1000.
3. The output is guaranteed to be non-negative since values[i] and values[j] are always positive and the smallest result from the distance term `i - j` is zero.

## Strategy

The goal is to maximize the expression `values[i] + values[j] + i - j` with the condition `i < j`. We can rewrite the expression as `(values[i] + i) + (values[j] - j)`. This can be broken down into two parts:

1. We need to keep track of the maximum `values[i] + i` observed so far.
2. For each `j`, calculate the possible score and update the maximum score if the current combination gives a higher value.

We can achieve this in a single pass through the array with O(n) time complexity.

## Code

Here is the implementation in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxScoreSightseeingPair(int[] values) {
        int maxScore = 0;
        int maxValuePlusIndex = values[0] + 0;

        for (int j = 1; j < values.length; j++) {
            // Calculate the current score using the best i found so far
            maxScore = Math.max(maxScore, values[j] - j + maxValuePlusIndex);

            // Update maxValuePlusIndex for the next iteration
            maxValuePlusIndex = Math.max(maxValuePlusIndex, values[j] + j);
        }

        return maxScore;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] values = {8, 1, 5, 2, 6};
        System.out.println(sol.maxScoreSightseeingPair(values));  // Output: 11
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `values` array. This is because we perform a single pass to update the `maxValuePlusIndex` and calculate the `maxScore`.

The space complexity is O(1) as we use a constant amount of additional space regardless of the input size.
