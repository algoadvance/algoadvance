[Leetcode 810. Chalkboard XOR Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l810)
## Problem Statement

Leetcode problem 810, "Chalkboard XOR Game," is described as follows:

You are given an array of integers `nums` representing the numbers on a chalkboard. Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of:

1. Choosing any one of the numbers on the chalkboard.
2. Erasing it from the chalkboard.
3. If the bitwise XOR of all the elements of the chalkboard is 0, that player wins.

If a player cannot make a move, they lose the game.

Given an integer array `nums`, if Alice wins, return `true`. If Bob wins, return `false`.

### Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1, 1, 2]
Output: false
Explanation:
Alice will erase either 1 or 2, then Bob will erase the remaining 2 or 1, and finally, Alice will erase the last number. 
Bob wins because the final XOR is 2, which is not zero.
```

### Constraints:

- 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
- 0 <= nums[i] <= \( 2^{16} \)

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array be empty or contain just one element?**
   - No, the problem constraints specify that the length of the array must be at least 1.

2. **Is there a limit on the size of elements in the array?**
   - Yes, each element must be between 0 and \( 2^{16} \) inclusive.

3. **Should the order of erased numbers matter?**
   - No, the order does not matter. The main focus is on achieving an XOR result of 0 when a player erases an element.

## Strategy

To solve the problem, let's analyze it step by step:

1. **Bitwise XOR Property**: XOR is commutative and associative, which means the order of operations does not matter. 
   - `a ^ b = b ^ a`
   - `a ^ (b ^ c) = (a ^ b) ^ c`

2. **Winning Condition**: If XOR of the entire array is 0 at any point, the player who just erased a number wins.

3. **Key Observations**:
    - If Alice starts and the XOR of the array is already 0, then Alice wins immediately.
    - For an array where the number of remaining elements `n`:
      1. If `n` is even, Alice always has a winning strategy. She can always choose an element to swap the XOR back to what it was before her turn.
      2. If `n` is odd, Bob can force a win because he can always choose moves such that Alice cannot control the game towards zeroing the XOR.

4. **Simplification**:
   - If the initial XOR of the array is 0, Alice wins directly.
   - If the length of the array is even, Alice wins.
   - If the length of the array is odd, Bob wins.

## Code

Here is the Java code implementing the solution based on the strategy outlined:

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean xorGame(int[] nums) {
        int xorSum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            xorSum ^= num;
        }
        return xorSum == 0 || nums.length % 2 == 0;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The solution has a linear time complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums` because it iterates through the array once to compute the XOR.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(1)` because no additional space proportional to the input size is used.

This ensures that the solution is efficient and scalable for the given constraints.
