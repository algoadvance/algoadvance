[Leetcode 2662. Minimum Cost of a Path With Special Roads](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2662)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `start` representing the starting coordinates `(x, y)` of your journey, an integer array `target` representing the target coordinates `(x, y)`, and an array `specialRoads` where each `specialRoads[i]` is an integer array of the form `[x1, y1, x2, y2, cost]` that represents a special road that you can use to travel from `(x1, y1)` to `(x2, y2)` with a travel cost of `cost`.

Return the minimum cost required to travel from `start` to `target`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the coordinates all positive integers? 
2. Can special roads have zero cost?
3. Is there a limit to the size of the input arrays?
4. Can we move freely on the plane regardless of the special roads, and if so, what is the cost?

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to consider the following approach:

1. Model the problem as a graph where each node represents a coordinate (x, y), and edges represent the cost of moving between these coordinates.
2. Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the start coordinate to the target coordinate:
   - **Nodes:** Coordinates in `start`, `target`, and all special road coordinates.
   - **Edges:**
     - Direct movement between adjacent coordinates with standard distance cost.
     - Movement through special roads with their given costs.
3. Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm is a good fit since it efficiently finds the shortest paths from a source node to all other nodes in a weighted graph.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MinimumCostPath {
    
    static class Node {
        int x, y, cost;
        
        Node(int x, int y, int cost) {
            this.x = x;
            this.y = y;
            this.cost = cost;
        }
    }
    
    public int getMinCost(int[] start, int[] target, int[][] specialRoads) {
        PriorityQueue<Node> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(node -> node.cost));
        Map<String, Integer> minCost = new HashMap<>();
        
        pq.add(new Node(start[0], start[1], 0));
        String startKey = start[0] + "," + start[1];
        String targetKey = target[0] + "," + target[1];
        minCost.put(startKey, 0);
        
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            Node current = pq.poll();
            String currentKey = current.x + "," + current.y;
            
            if (currentKey.equals(targetKey)) {
                return current.cost;
            }

            for (int[] road : specialRoads) {
                Node next = new Node(road[2], road[3], road[4]);
                String nextKey = next.x + "," + next.y;
                
                if (current.x == road[0] && current.y == road[1]) {
                    int newCost = current.cost + next.cost;
                    if (!minCost.containsKey(nextKey) || newCost < minCost.get(nextKey)) {
                        minCost.put(nextKey, newCost);
                        pq.add(new Node(next.x, next.y, newCost));
                    }
                }
            }
            
            // Check free moves to all special road starting points and target
            List<int[]> pointsToCheck = new ArrayList<>();
            pointsToCheck.add(target);
            for (int[] road : specialRoads) {
                pointsToCheck.add(new int[]{road[0], road[1]});
            }
            for (int[] point : pointsToCheck) {
                String pointKey = point[0] + "," + point[1];
                int newCost = current.cost + Math.abs(current.x - point[0]) + Math.abs(current.y - point[1]);
                if (!minCost.containsKey(pointKey) || newCost < minCost.get(pointKey)) {
                    minCost.put(pointKey, newCost);
                    pq.add(new Node(point[0], point[1], newCost));
                }
            }
        }
        
        return -1;  // In case there is no path (shouldn't happen in typical input)
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumCostPath solution = new MinimumCostPath();
        
        int[] start = {0, 0};
        int[] target = {3, 3};
        int[][] specialRoads = // use example from above
        
        System.out.println(solution.getMinCost(start, target, specialRoads));  // Example output
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm is `O((V + E) log V)`, where `V` is the number of vertices (coordinates) and `E` is the number of edges (possible moves). Given the constraints:
- `V` corresponds to all unique coordinates (start, target, special road coordinates). In the worst case, `V` is proportional to the number of given waypoints.
- `E` includes all possible direct movements and special road edges. With many special roads, complexity increases, but remains controlled by typical problem constraints.

This should efficiently handle typical problem sizes expected in an interview setup.
