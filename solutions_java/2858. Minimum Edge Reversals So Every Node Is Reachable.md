[Leetcode 2858. Minimum Edge Reversals So Every Node Is Reachable](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2858)
### Problem Statement
You are given a directed graph with `n` nodes, numbered from `1` to `n`, and `m` edges. An edge `(u, v)` denotes a directed edge from node `u` to node `v`.

The goal is to find the minimum number of edge reversals required so that every node in the graph is reachable from node `out`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format**: 
   - What is the format of the input? Perhaps an adjacency list or an array of edges?
2. **Constraints**: 
   - What is the range of `n` and `m`?
   - Are there any negative weights on edges, or is only direction important?
3. **Special Cases**:
   - What if the graph is already fully connected? Should the output be `0`?
   - Are self-loops and multiple edges between two nodes allowed?

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MinimumEdgeReversals {
    
    public int minimumEdgeReversals(int n, List<int[]> edges, int out) {
        // Convert edges to adjacency list with forward and backward edges
        List<int[]>[] graph = new List[n + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            graph[edge[0]].add(new int[]{edge[1], 0});  // Indicator 0 for original direction
            graph[edge[1]].add(new int[]{edge[0], 1});  // Indicator 1 for reversed direction
        }
        
        // Initialize distance array for edge reverse count
        int[] dist = new int[n + 1];
        Arrays.fill(dist, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        dist[out] = 0; // The starting point
        
        // Priority queue for Dijkstra-like traversal
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[1]));
        pq.add(new int[]{out, 0});
        
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            int[] curr = pq.poll();
            int u = curr[0];
            int revCnt = curr[1];
            
            if (revCnt > dist[u]) continue;
            
            for (int[] neighbor : graph[u]) {
                int v = neighbor[0];
                int isReversed = neighbor[1];
                int newDist = revCnt + isReversed;
                
                if (newDist < dist[v]) {
                    dist[v] = newDist;
                    pq.add(new int[]{v, newDist});
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Find the maximum number of reversals needed to reach every node
        int maxReversals = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (dist[i] == Integer.MAX_VALUE) return -1; // If a node is not reachable
            maxReversals = Math.max(maxReversals, dist[i]);
        }
        
        return maxReversals;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumEdgeReversals mer = new MinimumEdgeReversals();
        List<int[]> edges = Arrays.asList(
            new int[]{1, 2},
            new int[]{3, 2},
            new int[]{2, 4}
        );
        int outNode = 1;
        int result = mer.minimumEdgeReversals(4, edges, outNode);
        System.out.println("Minimum edge reversals required: " + result);
    }
}
```

### Strategy
1. **Graph Representation**: 
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the graph.
   - Each edge `(u, v)` will have both a forward edge `(u, v)` and a backward edge `(v, u)` with a flag indicating if it’s reversed.
   
2. **Traversal Mechanism**: 
   - Use a modified Dijkstra’s algorithm with a priority queue to calculate the minimum reversals to every node from the starting node `out`.
   - Each node maintains the minimum number of reversals needed to reach it.
   
3. **Update Rule**:
   - If visiting a node in the intended direction, the reversal count remains the same.
   - If the direction is reversed, increment the reversal count by `1`.
   
4. **Result Calculation**:
   - Among all nodes, if any node isn't reachable, the function returns `-1`.
   - Otherwise, return the maximum reversals found across all nodes.

### Time Complexity
- **Building the Graph**: O(m), where `m` is the number of edges.
- **Dijkstra-like Traversal with Priority Queue**: O((n + m) log n), where `n` is the number of nodes and `m` is the number of edges.

Overall, the time complexity is approximately O((n + m) log n).
