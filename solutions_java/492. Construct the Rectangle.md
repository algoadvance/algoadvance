[Leetcode 492. Construct the Rectangle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l492)
### Problem Statement:
The problem is to find a pair of integers `(L, W)` such that:

1. `L * W = area`
2. `L >= W`
3. The difference between `L` and `W` is minimal.

Given an integer `area`, you need to output the pair `(L, W)`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Q**: What is the range of the `area`?
   - **A**: The area is a positive integer and typically within the constraint limits of the problem (1 <= area <= 10^7).
   
2. **Q**: Can the values of `L` and `W` be equal?
   - **A**: Yes, `L` can be equal to `W` (especially in case of perfect squares).

3. **Q**: Should I consider both `L` and `W` to be integers?
   - **A**: Yes, `L` and `W` should be integers.

### Strategy:
To solve this problem:

1. **Start from the square root**: 
   - Since we want `L` and `W` to be as close as possible, start checking from the square root of `area`. This approach ensures that the values of `L` and `W` are close.
   
2. **Iterate Downwards**:
   - Iterate downwards from the square root until you find a `W` that divides the `area` perfectly.
   
3. **Compute L**:
   - For each valid `W`, compute `L` as `area / W`.

4. **Return the L and W Pair**:
   - When the first pair is found, return `(L, W)` where `L` is always equal to or greater than `W`.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is approximately `O(sqrt(area))` as we iterate from `sqrt(area)` down to `1`.

### Code:

```java
public class ConstructRectangle {
    public int[] constructRectangle(int area) {
        // Start from the square root of the area
        int W = (int) Math.sqrt(area);
        
        // Iterate downwards to find the width that divides the area perfectly
        while (area % W != 0) {
            W--;
        }
        
        // Compute L and return the results
        int L = area / W;
        return new int[] {L, W};
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ConstructRectangle cr = new ConstructRectangle();
        // Example usage:
        int[] result = cr.constructRectangle(122122);
        System.out.println("L = " + result[0] + ", W = " + result[1]);
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Initial Step**: Compute the integer value of square root of `area`.
   
2. **Iterate**: Check each value from this square root downwards to 1.
   - If a value perfectly divides the `area` (`area % W == 0`), then it can be considered as `W`.
   
3. **Calculate L**: Divide `area` by `W` to get `L`.
   
4. **Output**: Return the pair (L, W).

This method ensures that the pair `(L, W)` you find is the closest possible dimensions that could form the given area.
