[Leetcode 3241. Time Taken to Mark All Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3241)
### Problem Statement
You are given a tree (a connected, undirected graph with no cycles) with `n` nodes, numbered from `0` to `n-1`. Each node has a value associated with it. Initially, you start at the root node (which is always node 0), and you need to mark all nodes in the tree following these rules:

1. From any node, you can travel to its adjacent node.
2. Moving from one node to another node takes 1 unit of time.
3. After visiting all adjacent nodes of the current node, you must decide to mark the node or not.

The task is to find out the minimum time required to mark all the nodes in the tree.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Does marking a node take any additional time?**
   - No, marking takes no additional time.
2. **Is the input in the form of adjacency lists or adjacency matrix?**
   - This can be clarified before proceeding; typically, tree input is in adjacency list form.
3. **Do all nodes have to be visited at least once?**
   - Yes, all nodes have to be visited and marked.

### Strategy
To minimize the time taken to mark all nodes, consider a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal. By using a DFS we can easily calculate the time to visit all nodes and mark them efficiently:

1. **Tree Traversal using DFS:**
   - Perform a DFS from the root (node 0) to traverse all nodes.
   - Track the time taken to travel and mark each node.
   
2. **Marking Nodes:**
   - During the DFS traversal, keep track of the nodes visited and ensure each node is marked before moving back up the tree.
   
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Test for minimal tree (1 node).
   - Consider balancing the traversal to minimize backtracking.

### Code
Here's how the solution can be implemented in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class TimeToMarkAllNodes {
    
    private static class TreeNode {
        int val;
        List<TreeNode> children;
        TreeNode(int val) {
            this.val = val;
            this.children = new ArrayList<>();
        }
    }

    public int minTime(int n, int[][] edges) {
        // Building the tree from edges
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> tree = new HashMap<>();
        for(int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            tree.put(i, new ArrayList<>());
        }
        for(int[] edge : edges) {
            tree.get(edge[0]).add(edge[1]);
            tree.get(edge[1]).add(edge[0]);
        }
        
        // Perform DFS to calculate the minimal time to mark all nodes
        return dfs(0, -1, tree);
    }

    private int dfs(int node, int parent, Map<Integer, List<Integer>> tree) {
        int total_time = 0;
        for(int child : tree.get(node)) {
            if(child != parent) {
                // Time from child and back
                total_time += dfs(child, node, tree) + 2;
            }
        }
        return total_time;
    }
    
    // Driver function for testing
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TimeToMarkAllNodes instance = new TimeToMarkAllNodes();
        int n = 7;
        int[][] edges = { {0, 1}, {0, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 5}, {2, 6} };
        System.out.println(instance.minTime(n, edges)); // Expected output would be the minimal time taken to mark all nodes.
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes. We traverse each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` due to the recursion stack and the adjacency list representation of the tree.

This solution ensures all nodes are marked with minimal traversal overhead by using an efficient DFS approach.
