[Leetcode 2426. Number of Pairs Satisfying Inequality full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2426)
### Problem Statement

Given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of equal length `n` and an integer `diff`, return the number of pairs `(i, j)` where `0 <= i < j < n`, and `nums1[i] - nums1[j] <= nums2[i] - nums2[j] + diff`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the values in the arrays and `diff`?**
   - The values of the arrays and `diff` could range within the typical integer limits, i.e., -10^9 to 10^9.

2. **What is the maximum size of the arrays?**
   - The array sizes could be up to 10^5.

3. **Are the inputs guaranteed always to be valid?**
   - Yes, you can assume the inputs are always valid.

### Strategy

To efficiently solve the problem for large inputs, a brute-force approach with O(n^2) complexity will not be feasible.
Instead, we can consider the problem with a more optimal approach by observing the inequality and transforming it.

Given:
\[ \text{nums1}[i] - \text{nums1}[j] \leq \text{nums2}[i] - \text{nums2}[j] + \text{diff} \]

We can rearrange this to:
\[ \text{nums1}[i] - \text{nums2}[i] \leq \text{nums1}[j] - \text{nums2}[j] + \text{diff} \]

Define arrays `A` and `B` where:
\[ A[k] = \text{nums1}[k] - \text{nums2}[k] \]

Then the inequality becomes:
\[ A[i] \leq A[j] + \text{diff} \]

Our task is now to count pairs `(i, j)` where \( 0 \leq i < j < n \) that satisfy this inequality.

One effective way to count such pairs is by using a Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree).

### Steps:

1. Create an array `A` such that \( A[k] = \text{nums1}[k] - \text{nums2}[k] \).
2. Use a Fenwick Tree to efficiently count the pairs that satisfy the inequality.
3. For each pair, use the Fenwick Tree to update and query counts.

### Time Complexity

- The overall time complexity will be dominated by the operations on the Fenwick Tree, resulting in \( O(n \cdot \log n) \).

### Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    
    public int numberOfPairs(int[] nums1, int[] nums2, int diff) {
        int n = nums1.length;
        long[] A = new long[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            A[i] = (long)nums1[i] - nums2[i];
        }
        
        List<Long> elements = new ArrayList<>();
        for (long a : A) {
            elements.add(a);
            elements.add(a + diff);
        }
        
        Collections.sort(elements);
        
        FenwickTree fenwickTree = new FenwickTree(elements.size());
        
        int count = 0;
        
        for (long a : A) {
            int index = Collections.binarySearch(elements, a + diff);
            count += fenwickTree.prefixSum(index + 1);
            
            index = Collections.binarySearch(elements, a);
            fenwickTree.add(index + 1, 1);
        }
        
        return count;
    }
    
    class FenwickTree {
        int[] tree;
        int n;
        
        public FenwickTree(int size) {
            this.n = size;
            this.tree = new int[n + 1];
        }
        
        public void add(int index, int value) {
            while (index <= n) {
                tree[index] += value;
                index += index & -index;
            }
        }
        
        public int prefixSum(int index) {
            int sum = 0;
            while (index > 0) {
                sum += tree[index];
                index -= index & -index;
            }
            return sum;
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Array `A` Calculation:** We compute the array `A` as the difference between `nums1` and `nums2`.
2. **Elements List:** We create a list of elements that includes both `A[i]` and `A[i] + diff` for all `i`.
3. **Fenwick Tree:** We use a Fenwick Tree to maintain counts of elements and efficiently query the sum of elements up to a certain index.
4. **Conversion of Values:** We convert values by using `Collections.binarySearch` on the sorted elements list to work with indices efficiently in Fenwick Tree operations.

This approach leverages efficient updating and querying using Fenwick Tree alongside the transformation of the problem into a more manageable form.
