[Leetcode 921. Minimum Add to Make Parentheses Valid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l921)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` of '(' and ')' parentheses characters, you are tasked to return the minimum number of parentheses you must add to make the resulting parentheses string valid.

A parentheses string is considered valid if:
1. Every opening parenthesis '(' has a corresponding closing parenthesis ')'.
2. Every closing parenthesis ')' has a corresponding opening parenthesis '('.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Restrictions:**
   - Can we assume that the input string length won't exceed a reasonable number for performance considerations?
   - Input will consist only of '(' and ')' characters.

2. **Output Specification:**
   - Should the function return an integer value representing the minimum number of parentheses required to make the string valid?

### Code

```java
public class MinimumAddToMakeParenthesesValid {
    public int minAddToMakeValid(String s) {
        // Track the balance of parentheses
        int balance = 0;
        // Count the number of insertions needed
        int insertions = 0;

        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '(') {
                balance++;
            } else {
                balance--;
                // if balance goes negative, it means we have more closing
                // than opening, so we need to add an opening parenthesis
                if (balance < 0) {
                    insertions++;
                    balance = 0;  // reset balance to zero since we added a '('
                }
            }
        }

        // Any remaining balance means we have unmatched opening parentheses
        return insertions + balance;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumAddToMakeParenthesesValid solution = new MinimumAddToMakeParenthesesValid();
        String s1 = "())";
        String s2 = "(((";
        String s3 = "()";
        String s4 = "()))((";
        
        System.out.println(solution.minAddToMakeValid(s1));  // Output: 1
        System.out.println(solution.minAddToMakeValid(s2));  // Output: 3
        System.out.println(solution.minAddToMakeValid(s3));  // Output: 0
        System.out.println(solution.minAddToMakeValid(s4));  // Output: 4
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialize two variables:**
   - `balance`: This represents the current balance of the parentheses. A positive balance indicates more '(' characters, and a negative balance indicates more ')' characters.
   - `insertions`: This keeps track of how many insertions we need to make a balanced string.

2. **Iterate through each character in the string:**
   - If the character is '(', increment the balance.
   - If the character is ')', decrement the balance. If the balance goes negative, it means there are more closing parentheses than opening ones at this point. 
   - To balance this, increment `insertions` and reset `balance` to zero.

3. **After processing all characters, any residual positive `balance` indicates unmatched opening parentheses, so add this balance to `insertions` for the final result.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we process each character of the string exactly once in a single pass. The space complexity is **O(1)** since we are using only a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
