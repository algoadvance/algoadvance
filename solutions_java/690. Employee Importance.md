[Leetcode 690. Employee Importance](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l690)
### Problem Statement

You have a data structure representing a company of employees. Each employee has a unique ID, a value representing their importance, and a list of IDs of their direct subordinates. You need to find the total importance value of an employee and all their subordinates.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Employee info:
[ 
  { "id": 1, "importance": 5, "subordinates": [2, 3] }, 
  { "id": 2, "importance": 3, "subordinates": [] }, 
  { "id": 3, "importance": 3, "subordinates": [] }
]

Given the employee ID 1, the total importance value should be 11.
```

**Note:**

1. One employee has at most one direct leader, and may have several subordinates.
2. The maximum number of employees won't exceed 2000.

### Clarifying Questions

1. How should I access the employees' data? Is it given as a list of objects?
   - Yes, the employee data is given as a list of Employee objects.

2. Is the employee structure given as a pre-defined class?
   - Yes, the structure of the `Employee` class is predefined. Here it is for reference:
   
   ```java
   class Employee {
       public int id;
       public int importance;
       public List<Integer> subordinates;
   }
   ```

### Strategy

1. **Data Retrieval**: Create a mapping from the employee's ID to the corresponding `Employee` object for quick access.
2. **Recursive Importance Calculation**: Define a recursive function that, given an employee ID, computes the total importance by summing the employee's own importance and the importance of all their subordinates.
3. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Use Depth-First Search to traverse from the given employee to all their subordinates recursively.

### Code

Here is the Java implementation of the described approach:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;

class Employee {
    public int id;
    public int importance;
    public List<Integer> subordinates;
}

public class Solution {
    
    private Map<Integer, Employee> employeeMap;
    
    public int getImportance(List<Employee> employees, int id) {
        // Create a map from id to Employee object for fast access
        employeeMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (Employee emp : employees) {
            employeeMap.put(emp.id, emp);
        }
        return dfs(id);
    }
    
    private int dfs(int id) {
        Employee emp = employeeMap.get(id);
        int totalImportance = emp.importance;
        for (int subId : emp.subordinates) {
            totalImportance += dfs(subId);
        }
        return totalImportance;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The DFS approach ensures that each employee and each subordinate relationship is visited exactly once. Given `n` total employees, the time complexity is `O(n)`.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also `O(n)` due to the storage required for the hashmap and the system stack during recursive calls.
