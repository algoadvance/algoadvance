[Leetcode 1769. Minimum Number of Operations to Move All Balls to Each Box](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1769)
### Problem Statement

You have `n` boxes. Each box is numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and contains some balls. You are given a binary string `boxes` of length `n`, where `boxes[i]` is `'0'` if the `i-th` box is empty and `'1'` if it contains one ball.

In one operation, you can move one ball from a box to an adjacent box. You need to return an array `answer` of size `n`, where `answer[i]` is the minimum number of operations needed to move all the balls to the `i-th` box.

Example:
```
Input: boxes = "110"
Output: [1,1,3]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there constraints on the size of the input string `boxes`?**
   - Typically, constraints will be given in the problem description. For this example, let's assume `1 <= boxes.length <= 2000`.

2. **Can we assume valid input as per constraints?**
   - Yes, the input string `boxes` will only contain `'0'` and `'1'`.

3. **Can we consider edge cases with minimal input size (e.g., string length of 1 or all boxes empty/filled)?**
   - Yes, we should be prepared to handle those cases as well.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we'll follow this approach:

1. **Brute Force**: 
   - For each box `i`, iterate over every other box `j` and if `boxes[j]` contains a ball (`'1'`), add the distance `|i - j|` to the operation count for `i`.
   - This solution works in O(n^2) time complexity but is not efficient for large values of `n`.

2. **Optimized Approach**:
   - Use prefix sums to calculate distances more efficiently.
   - Calculate the operations required to move all balls to each box in two passes:
     1. **Left to Right Pass**: Calculate the cost for moving balls to each box from the left to right.
     2. **Right to Left Pass**: Calculate the cost for moving balls to each box back again from the right to left.
   - This approach improves the efficiency to O(n) time complexity.

### Code

```java
public class MinimumNumberOfOperations {

    public int[] minOperations(String boxes) {
        int n = boxes.length();
        int[] answer = new int[n];

        // Left to right pass
        int balls = 0, operations = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            answer[i] += operations;
            balls += boxes.charAt(i) - '0';
            operations += balls;
        }

        // Right to left pass
        balls = 0; 
        operations = 0;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            answer[i] += operations;
            balls += boxes.charAt(i) - '0';
            operations += balls;
        }

        return answer;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumNumberOfOperations solution = new MinimumNumberOfOperations();
        String boxes = "110";
        int[] result = solution.minOperations(boxes);
        // Expected Output: [1, 1, 3]
        for (int i : result) {
            System.out.print(i + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string `boxes`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the result in the `answer` array.

This ensures the solution is efficient and can handle larger input sizes up to 2000 boxes as per typical constraints.
