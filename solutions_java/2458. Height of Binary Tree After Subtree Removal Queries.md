[Leetcode 2458. Height of Binary Tree After Subtree Removal Queries](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2458)
## Problem Statement:

You are given the root of a binary tree and an array `queries` where `queries[i]` is an integer that denotes a node of the tree. For each query, remove the subtree rooted at the corresponding node, and return an array `answers` of height of the remaining trees after each removal.

**Example:**
```
Input: 
root = [1,3,4,2,8,null,null,7,9,null,6]
queries = [3,2,4]
Output: [3,2,3]
```
**Note:**
- The height of a tree is defined as the number of edges in the longest path from the root to a leaf.
- The tree is rooted at `root` and represented in the form of an array. 

## Clarifying Questions:
1. What should happen if a query node doesn't exist in the tree?
2. Can the tree have duplicate values?
3. What is the expected constraint on the size of the tree and the number of queries?
4. Should we handle the case where `root` is null?
5. Are there any constraints on the values of the nodes?

## Strategy:

1. Parse the tree from the given array representation.
2. For each query, find and remove the subtree rooted at the specified node.
3. Calculate the height of the remaining tree after each removal.
4. Prepare the result list of heights for the remaining trees after each query.

### Steps to Solve:
1. Parse the tree array into a binary tree.
2. Implement a function to calculate the height of a binary tree.
3. Implement a function to remove a subtree from a binary tree.
4. Iterate over each query, remove the specified subtree, and calculate the height of the remaining tree.
5. Store and return the heights after each query.

## Code:

```java
import java.util.*;

class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> treeQueries(TreeNode root, int[] queries) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int query : queries) {
            TreeNode removedSubtree = removeSubtree(root, query);
            result.add(height(root));
        }
        return result;
    }
    
    private TreeNode removeSubtree(TreeNode root, int value) {
        if (root == null) return null;
        if (root.val == value) return null;
        root.left = removeSubtree(root.left, value);
        root.right = removeSubtree(root.right, value);
        return root;
    }
    
    private int height(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return -1;
        return 1 + Math.max(height(root.left), height(root.right));
    }

    // Helper function to build a tree from the given array.
    public TreeNode buildTree(Integer[] nodes) {
        if (nodes == null || nodes.length == 0) return null;
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(nodes[0]);
        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(root);
        int i = 1;
        while (i < nodes.length) {
            TreeNode current = queue.poll();
            if (nodes[i] != null) {
                current.left = new TreeNode(nodes[i]);
                queue.add(current.left);
            }
            i++;
            if (i < nodes.length && nodes[i] != null) {
                current.right = new TreeNode(nodes[i]);
                queue.add(current.right);
            }
            i++;
        }
        return root;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        Integer[] rootArray = {1,3,4,2,8,null,null,7,9,null,6};
        int[] queries = {3, 2, 4};
        TreeNode root = sol.buildTree(rootArray);
        List<Integer> result = sol.treeQueries(root, queries);
        System.out.println(result); // Output should be [3, 2, 3]
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:

1. **Building the Tree:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the array.
2. **Removing Subtree:** For each query, it has a worst-case complexity of O(n) as we might have to traverse the whole tree.
3. **Calculating Height:** O(n) in the worst case for each query.

Since we process each query independently:
- The complexity for M queries would be O(M * n).

This gives us an overall complexity of O(M * n).
