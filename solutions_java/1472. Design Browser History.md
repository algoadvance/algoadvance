[Leetcode 1472. Design Browser History](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1472)
### Problem Statement
Design a `BrowserHistory` class that simulates browsing through web pages. Implement the following methods:

1. `BrowserHistory(String homepage)`: Initializes the object with the homepage of the browser.
2. `void visit(String url)`: Visits the URL from the current page, creating a new history entry.
3. `String back(int steps)`: Returns to the site that was visited `steps` steps before. If you can't move back, return the earliest page. Adjusts the current page position accordingly.
4. `String forward(int steps)`: Moves forward `steps` steps in history starting from the current page. If you can't move forward, return the latest page. Adjusts the current page position accordingly.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Q: Can the URLs contain special characters or spaces?
   A: Yes, they can contain any valid URL characters.

2. Q: Is there any restriction on the number of history entries?
   A: There is no explicit restriction mentioned, so assume that history entries can be arbitrarily large within the limits of available memory.

3. Q: Should we handle any concurrent access or can we assume single-threaded access?
   A: Assume single-threaded access for simplicity.

### Strategy
1. Use a list (or an array) to store the history of visited URLs.
2. Maintain a current position pointer to track the entry in the history list that corresponds to the currently displayed URL.
3. When `visit` is called, truncate the history list to remove forward history if the current position is not at the end, then append the new URL to the history and move the current position pointer to the end.
4. For `back`, move the current position pointer back by the specified steps but not before the start of the list.
5. For `forward`, move the current position pointer forward by the specified steps but not beyond the list's end.

### Code
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class BrowserHistory {
    private List<String> history;
    private int currentIndex;

    public BrowserHistory(String homepage) {
        history = new ArrayList<>();
        history.add(homepage);
        currentIndex = 0;
    }

    public void visit(String url) {
        // Remove all forward history if any
        while (history.size() > currentIndex + 1) {
            history.remove(history.size() - 1);
        }
        history.add(url);
        currentIndex++;
    }

    public String back(int steps) {
        currentIndex = Math.max(0, currentIndex - steps);
        return history.get(currentIndex);
    }

    public String forward(int steps) {
        currentIndex = Math.min(history.size() - 1, currentIndex + steps);
        return history.get(currentIndex);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example test case
        BrowserHistory browserHistory = new BrowserHistory("leetcode.com");
        browserHistory.visit("google.com");       // You are in "leetcode.com". Visit "google.com"
        browserHistory.visit("facebook.com");     // You are in "google.com". Visit "facebook.com"
        browserHistory.visit("youtube.com");      // You are in "facebook.com". Visit "youtube.com"
        System.out.println(browserHistory.back(1)); // You are in "youtube.com", move back to "facebook.com" Output: facebook.com
        System.out.println(browserHistory.back(1)); // You are in "facebook.com", move back to "google.com" Output: google.com
        System.out.println(browserHistory.forward(1)); // You are in "google.com", move forward to "facebook.com" Output: facebook.com
        browserHistory.visit("linkedin.com");    // You are in "facebook.com". Visit "linkedin.com"
        System.out.println(browserHistory.forward(2)); // You are in "linkedin.com", you can't move forward any steps. You remain in "linkedin.com". Output: linkedin.com
        System.out.println(browserHistory.back(2)); // You are in "linkedin.com", move back to "google.com". Output: google.com
        System.out.println(browserHistory.back(7)); // You are in "google.com", move back to "leetcode.com". Output: leetcode.com
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- `BrowserHistory(String homepage)`: O(1) since it is a simple initialization.
- `visit(String url)`: Amortized O(1) if we consider the list operation. However, removing elements to maintain the list can take O(n) in the worst case where n is the number of forward entries.
- `back(int steps)`: O(1) since it involves simple arithmetic and bounds checking.
- `forward(int steps)`: O(1) since it involves simple arithmetic and bounds checking.
