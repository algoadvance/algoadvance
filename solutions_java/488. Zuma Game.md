[Leetcode 488. Zuma Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l488)
## Problem Statement

You are playing a variation of the Zuma Game, where a board of balls is in front of you, each with a color represented by a character (e.g., 'R', 'Y', 'B', 'G', 'W'). You also have several balls in your hand, represented by a string. Your goal is to remove all the balls from the board. A move consists of inserting a ball from your hand into the board such that three or more consecutive balls of the same color are formed, which will then be automatically removed. These removals may cause multiple consecutive changes. You need to find the minimal number of moves required to remove all the balls. If no such move exists, return -1.

### Example

```
Input: board = "WRRBBW", hand = "RB"
Output: -1

Input: board = "WWRRBBWW", hand = "WRBRW"
Output: 2

Input: board = "G", hand = "GGGGG"
Output: 2

Input: board = "RBYYBBRRB", hand = "YRBGB"
Output: 3
```

### Constraints
- `1 <= board.length <= 16`
- `1 <= hand.length <= 5`
- `board` and `hand` consist of characters 'R', 'Y', 'B', 'G', 'W'.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the hand have more than one ball of the same color?**
   Yes, multiple balls in the hand can be of the same color.

2. **Do we have only up to 5 colors possible?**
   Yes, only 'R', 'Y', 'B', 'G', and 'W' are used.

## Strategy

1. **Recursive Backtracking with Memoization**:
   - Use a recursive function with memoization to explore the insertion of each ball in the hand into each possible position in the board.
   - After each insertion, check and remove sequences of three or more consecutive balls of the same color.
   - Continue recursively until the board is empty or we've exhausted all possible moves.

2. **Helper Functions**:
   - `removeSequences`: A function that will remove sequences of three or more continuous balls of the same color.
   - `dfs`: A depth-first search function that attempts to make all possible moves and use memoization to store already computed states.

## Code

Here's the implementation of the solution:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class ZumaGame {
    private Map<String, Integer> memo = new HashMap<>();

    public int findMinStep(String board, String hand) {
        int[] handCount = new int[26];
        for (char c : hand.toCharArray()) {
            handCount[c - 'A']++;
        }
        int result = dfs(board, handCount);
        return result == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : result;
    }

    private int dfs(String board, int[] handCount) {
        if (board.isEmpty()) {
            return 0;
        }
        String key = board + Arrays.toString(handCount);
        if (memo.containsKey(key)) {
            return memo.get(key);
        }
        int result = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int i = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < board.length(); j++) {
            if (board.charAt(j) == board.charAt(i)) {
                continue;
            }
            int ballsToInsert = 3 - (j - i);
            if (handCount[board.charAt(i) - 'A'] >= ballsToInsert) {
                handCount[board.charAt(i) - 'A'] -= ballsToInsert;
                int newResult = dfs(board.substring(0, i) + board.substring(j), handCount);
                if (newResult != Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
                    result = Math.min(result, newResult + ballsToInsert);
                }
                handCount[board.charAt(i) - 'A'] += ballsToInsert;
            }
            i = j;
        }
        memo.put(key, result);
        return result;
    }

    private String removeSequences(String board) {
        int i = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j <= board.length(); ++j) {
            if (j == board.length() || board.charAt(j) != board.charAt(i)) {
                if (j - i >= 3) {
                    return removeSequences(board.substring(0, i) + board.substring(j));
                } else {
                    i = j;
                }
            }
        }
        return board;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ZumaGame solution = new ZumaGame();
        System.out.println(solution.findMinStep("WRRBBW", "RB")); // Output: -1
        System.out.println(solution.findMinStep("WWRRBBWW", "WRBRW")); // Output: 2
        System.out.println(solution.findMinStep("G", "GGGGG")); // Output: 2
        System.out.println(solution.findMinStep("RBYYBBRRB", "YRBGB")); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity is highly dependent on the number of possible states, given the constraints. Since the maximum length of `board` is 16 and `hand` is 5, the complexity is approximately O(n!) due to the factorial nature of placing and removing balls recursively. Memoization helps to reduce redundant calculations.
