[Leetcode 2151. Maximum Good People Based on Statements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2151)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer `n` which represents the number of people, and a 2D array `statements` of size `n x n` where `statements[i][j]` can be:
- `0` meaning person `i` states that person `j` is bad.
- `1` meaning person `i` states that person `j` is good.
- `2` meaning person `i` has no statement about person `j`.

Return the maximum number of people who can be good based on these statements.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Is it possible for a person's statements to contradict themselves (i.e., does the problem guarantee internal consistency within a person's statements)?
   - **A:** The statements are provided without internal consistency constraint, meaning a person could theoretically say contradictory things and that needs to be checked during the solution process.
   
2. **Q:** Can there be an empty `statements` array?
   - **A:** No, at least one person is guaranteed (n >= 1).
   
3. **Q:** How should contradictions between different persons' statements be handled?
   - **A:** The goal is to find the maximum number of people that can be considered good while simultaneously ensuring that all statements from them are self-consistent.

### Strategy
1. **Brute Force with Bitmasking:**
   - Use a bitmask to iterate through all possible subsets of people being good.
   - Validate each subset by ensuring that if a person is considered good, their statements do not contradict the current subset state.

2. **Validation:**
   - For each subset configuration (bitmask), check if all statements from considered good people hold true.
   - Compare each person's statements assuming they are good and check consistency.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int maximumGood(int[][] statements) {
        int n = statements.length;
        int maxGoodPeople = 0;

        for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
            if (isValidConfiguration(statements, mask, n)) {
                maxGoodPeople = Math.max(maxGoodPeople, Integer.bitCount(mask));
            }
        }

        return maxGoodPeople;
    }

    private boolean isValidConfiguration(int[][] statements, int mask, int n) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) == 0) { // skip if current person i is considered bad
                continue;
            }
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (statements[i][j] == 2) { // no statement, continue
                    continue;
                }
                boolean isGood = (mask & (1 << j)) != 0;
                if (statements[i][j] == 1 && !isGood) { // person i says j is good, but j is not good
                    return false;
                }
                if (statements[i][j] == 0 && isGood) { // person i says j is bad, but j is good
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true; // all statements are consistent
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Exponential in Nature:** \(O(2^n \cdot n^2)\)
  - We iterate over all \(2^n\) possible subsets of people.
  - For each subset configuration, we validate it in \(O(n^2)\) time by checking consistency of statements.

While the time complexity is high, this is acceptable for \(n\) up to around 15 (as \(2^{15}\) is manageable), making it feasible for small problem sizes as typically seen in coding interviews.
