[Leetcode 2430. Maximum Deletions on a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2430)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s`. We want to delete characters from the string until we cannot delete anymore and still have the string be a palindrome. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. Your goal is to determine the maximum number of deletions that can be performed.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the length range of the string `s`?
   - What characters can `s` contain (e.g., lowercase, uppercase, digits)?

2. **Output:**
   - Are we allowed to return the total count of deletions or is there a different form of return value expected?

### Strategy

The problem can be rephrased to find the maximum number of deletions required to create a longest palindrome subsequence. Given that deleting certain characters can help form a palindrome, we can use Dynamic Programming (DP) to address the problem efficiently:
- Use a DP table where `dp[i][j]` indicates the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring `s[i..j]`.
- Update the table based on whether the characters at positions `i` and `j` are the same or not.

**Steps to solve:**
1. Initialize a 2D DP array.
2. Use a bottom-up DP approach to fill the table.
3. Calculate the number of deletions required by subtracting the length of the longest palindromic subsequence from the total length of the string.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxDeletions(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[n][n];
        
        // Every single character is a palindrome of length 1
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i][i] = 1;
        }
        
        // Fill the table
        for (int length = 2; length <= n; length++) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - length; i++) {
                int j = i + length - 1;
                if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 2;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // The length of the longest palindromic subsequence
        int longestPalindromeSubseqLength = dp[0][n - 1];
        
        // Maximum deletions to form a palindrome
        return n - longestPalindromeSubseqLength;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.maxDeletions("abccba")); // Output: 0
        System.out.println(sol.maxDeletions("aebcbda")); // Output: 2
        System.out.println(sol.maxDeletions("abcd")); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is **O(n^2)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is due to the nested loop used to fill the DP table.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is also **O(n^2)** due to the 2D DP array used to store the lengths of the longest palindromic subsequences for substrings of `s`.
