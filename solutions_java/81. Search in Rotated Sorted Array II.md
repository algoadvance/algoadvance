[Leetcode 81. Search in Rotated Sorted Array II full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l81)
### Problem Statement:
You are given an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order (with distinct values) that has been rotated at an unknown pivot index. You are also given an integer `target`. Suppose the array initially looked like this: `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` and it was rotated at an unknown pivot index `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]`.

Write a function to search `target` in `nums`. If `target` exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can the array contain duplicates? (Note: Typically, Leetcode problem 81 allows duplicates to be present in the array)
   - Yes.
2. What is the expected time complexity for this problem?
   - Ideally, O(log n), but due to the presence of duplicates, in some cases, the time complexity could degrade to O(n).

### Strategy:
1. **Algorithm Choice**: Binary Search.
2. **Handling Duplicates**: Because duplicates are present, the standard rotated binary search (which relies on distinct values to determine if pivot is in left or right half) needs modification.
3. **Steps**:
   - Initialize two pointers `left` and `right` at the start and end of the array.
   - While `left` <= `right`, calculate `mid`.
   - Check if `nums[mid]` is the target.
   - If not, compare elements to determine which half is sorted.
   - If `nums[left]` is equal to `nums[mid]`, move the `left` pointer right by one (`left++`) to skip the duplicate.
   - If `nums[mid]` is equal to `nums[right]`, move the `right` pointer left by one (`right--`) to skip the duplicate.
   - Based on sorted half, decide whether to move `left` or `right` to narrow the search.

### Code:
```java
public class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) return -1;

        int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return mid;
            }

            // the only change is here: handling duplicates
            if (nums[left] == nums[mid] && nums[mid] == nums[right]) {
                ++left;
                --right;
            } else if (nums[left] <= nums[mid]) { // left part is sorted
                if (nums[left] <= target && target < nums[mid]) {
                    right = mid - 1;
                } else {
                    left = mid + 1;
                }
            } else { // right part is sorted
                if (nums[mid] < target && target <= nums[right]) {
                    left = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    right = mid - 1;
                }
            }
        }

        return -1; // target not found
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {4,5,6,7,0,1,2};
        int target = 0;
        System.out.println(sol.search(nums, target)); // Output: 4
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Best Case**: O(log n) when the duplicates are minimal or do not affect the decision on the pivot and sorted halves.
- **Worst Case**: O(n) if duplicates cause multiple shifts of either `left` or `right`, effectively searching the array linearly.

### Space Complexity:
- O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space.
