[Leetcode 546. Remove Boxes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l546)
### Problem Statement
You are given several boxes with different colors represented by different positive numbers. You may experience several rounds to remove boxes until there are no more boxes left. Each time you can choose some continuous boxes with the same color (composed of `k` boxes, `k >= 1`), remove them, and get `k * k` points.

Find the maximum points you can get.

**Example:**
```
Input: boxes = [1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 1]
Output: 23
Explanation:
[1, 3, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 3, 1]
----> [1, 3, 3, 4, 3, 1] (remove 3 '2's, score 3*3=9)
----> [1, 3, 3, 3, 1] (remove 1 '4', score 1*1=1)
----> [1, 3, 3, 1] (remove 1 '3', score 1*1=1)
----> [1, 1] (remove 2 '3's, score 2*2=4)
----> [] (remove 2 '1's, score 2*2=4)
Total score = 9 + 1 + 1 + 4 + 4 = 23
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the box values always positive integers?**
   - Yes.
2. **What is the maximum length of the `boxes` array?**
   - Assume `boxes` can be up to 100.
3. **Are there any constraints on execution time?**
   - Standard LeetCode constraints imply efficient solutions are preferred. O(n^4) or better would be reasonable for n up to 100.

### Strategy
This problem can be efficiently solved using dynamic programming (DP) along with memoization for overlapping subproblems.

1. **DP State Representation:**
   - Let's use a 3D DP array `dp[l][r][k]` representing the maximum points obtainable from the subarray `boxes[l]` to `boxes[r]` with `k` boxes to the right of `r` having the same color as `boxes[r]`.

2. **Base Case:**
   - `dp[l][r][0] = 0` if `l > r`. No boxes to remove.

3. **Recurrence Relations:**
   - Direct removal: Remove the contiguous boxes `boxes[l]` to `boxes[r]` which all have the same value `boxes[r]` with `k` additional boxes of the same color:
     ``` 
     dp[l][r][k] = dp[l][r-1][0] + (k+1) * (k+1)
     ```

   - Division: Try to split the problem into subproblems:
     ``` 
     for m in range(l, r):
         if boxes[m] == boxes[r]:
             dp[l][r][k] = max(dp[l][r][k], dp[l][m][k+1] + dp[m+1][r-1][0])
     ```

4. **Initialization and Solution Extraction:**
   - Start with the whole array and recursively calculate using the above relations. Finally, the solution will be found in `dp[0][n-1][0]`.

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int removeBoxes(int[] boxes) {
        int n = boxes.length;
        int[][][] dp = new int[n][n][n];

        return dfs(boxes, 0, n - 1, 0, dp);
    }

    private int dfs(int[] boxes, int l, int r, int k, int[][][] dp) {
        if (l > r) return 0;
        if (dp[l][r][k] != 0) return dp[l][r][k];

        while (l < r && boxes[r] == boxes[r - 1]) {
            r--;
            k++;
        }

        dp[l][r][k] = dfs(boxes, l, r - 1, 0, dp) + (k + 1) * (k + 1);

        for (int m = l; m < r; m++) {
            if (boxes[m] == boxes[r]) {
                dp[l][r][k] = Math.max(dp[l][r][k], dfs(boxes, l, m, k + 1, dp) + dfs(boxes, m + 1, r - 1, 0, dp));
            }
        }

        return dp[l][r][k];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^4)
  - We have three variables in the DP state, each ranging up to n, leading to O(n^3) states and each state involves solving subproblems with O(n) operations.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n^3) for the DP table.
