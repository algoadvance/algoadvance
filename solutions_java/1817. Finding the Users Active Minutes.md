[Leetcode 1817. Finding the Users Active Minutes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1817)
### Problem Statement
You are provided with a 2D integer array `logs` where `each logs[i] = [ID, time]`. The array represents the user activity logs that were created, with `ID` representing the user ID, and `time` representing the minute in which the user performed an action. 

We want to compute a list `result` such that for each `k` from `1` to `n` (where `n` is the size of the result list), `result[k-1]` is the number of users whose active minutes (UAM) are exactly `k`.

A user's active minutes are defined as the count of unique minutes during which the user performed an action. We need to find the number of users who have exactly `1`, `2`, `3`, ..., `n` unique active minutes in the ascending order of `k`.

**Example:**

```
Input: logs = [[1,1],[2,2],[2,3]]
Output: [1,1,0]
Explanation:
The user with ID=1 performed exactly 1 action at minute 1, making the count of UAM 1.
The user with ID=2 performed actions at minutes 2 and 3, making the count of UAM 2.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should the output represent?**
   - The output should be an array where the element at the k-th index(0-indexed) represents the number of users whose active minutes are `k+1`.

2. **Can there be multiple entries with the same [ID, time] for the logs?**
   - No. Each entry `[ID, time]` is unique.

3. **What will be the maximum size of `logs`?**
   - You can assume `logs` length `<= 10^4`.

4. **Is there any constraint on the values of ID and time in logs?**
   - Both `ID` and `time` are positive integers.

### Strategy
1. **Data Structures:**
   - Use a `HashMap<Integer, Set<Integer>>` to keep track of the unique active minutes for each user. The `key` is the user ID, and the `value` is a `Set` of minutes.

2. **Steps:**
   - Iterate through the `logs` to populate the `HashMap`.
   - Create an array `activeMinutesCount` to store the count of users for each unique active minute.
   - Use another pass to populate the `activeMinutesCount` based on the information in the `HashMap`.
   - Determining `n` dynamically, find the maximum UAM across users and create the result array accordingly.

3. **Complexity Analysis:**
   - Time complexity: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the logs.
   - Space complexity: `O(m)` where `m` is the number of unique users and minutes.

### Code
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int[] findingUsersActiveMinutes(int[][] logs, int k) {
        // Mapping user ID to a set of unique minutes
        Map<Integer, Set<Integer>> userActiveMinutes = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int[] log : logs) {
            int id = log[0];
            int time = log[1];
            
            userActiveMinutes.putIfAbsent(id, new HashSet<>());
            userActiveMinutes.get(id).add(time);
        }
        
        // Count the frequency of each unique active minute count
        int[] uamCount = new int[k];
        for (Set<Integer> minutes : userActiveMinutes.values()) {
            int uniqueMinutesCount = minutes.size();
            if (uniqueMinutesCount <= k) {
                uamCount[uniqueMinutesCount - 1]++;
            }
        }
        
        return uamCount;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[][] logs = \ use example from above
        int k = 3;
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(sol.findingUsersActiveMinutes(logs, k)));  // Output: [1, 1, 0]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The solution iterates the logs array once to populate the `HashMap`, which takes `O(n)`. It then iterates over the entries in the `HashMap` to determine the counts, which is at most `O(m)` with `m` as the number of unique users.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n + m)` which simplifies to `O(n)` since `m` is usually significantly smaller than `n`.

### Space Complexity
The space used by the `HashMap` and `HashSet` structures is proportional to the number of unique user IDs and unique times, hence, the space complexity is `O(m)` where `m` is the number of unique users and minutes.
