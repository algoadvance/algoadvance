[Leetcode 1079. Letter Tile Possibilities](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1079)
### Problem Statement

You have a set of tiles, where each tile has one letter `tiles[i]` printed on it. Return the number of possible non-empty sequences of letters you can make.

#### Example:

- **Input:** "AAB"
- **Output:** 8
- **Explanation:** The sequences can be:
    "A", "B", "AA", "AB", "BA", "AAB", "ABA", "BAA"

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the tiles contain lowercase letters?
   **A:** No, the problem specifies uppercase English letters only.
   
2. **Q:** Can the same sequence be counted multiple times?
   **A:** No, each sequence should be unique and counted only once.

3. **Q:** Is the order of characters in the sequences important?
   **A:** Yes, the order matters, so "AB" and "BA" are different sequences.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use Depth-First Search (DFS). We'll recursively form sequences and use a set to ensure each sequence is unique. Here's the detailed approach:

1. Start with a given set of tiles.
2. Use a DFS approach to generate all possible sequences.
3. Use a boolean array to keep track of used tiles to avoid duplicate sequences.
4. Add each unique sequence to a set and check if it's already added to ensure uniqueness.
5. Return the total number of unique sequences.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class Solution {
    public int numTilePossibilities(String tiles) {
        Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
        boolean[] used = new boolean[tiles.length()];
        backtrack(tiles, new StringBuilder(), used, set);
        return set.size();
    }

    private void backtrack(String tiles, StringBuilder path, boolean[] used, Set<String> set) {
        if (path.length() > 0) {
            set.add(path.toString());
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < tiles.length(); i++) {
            if (used[i]) continue;
            path.append(tiles.charAt(i));
            used[i] = true;
            backtrack(tiles, path, used, set);
            path.deleteCharAt(path.length() - 1);
            used[i] = false;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.numTilePossibilities("AAB")); // Output: 8
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity involves the factorial terms as we are generating all permutations:
- **Worst-case analysis:** For a string of length `n`, the time complexity is `O(n * n!)` where:
  - `n!` accounts for generating all permutations of the characters.
  - `n` accounts for the recursive concatenation of each generated permutation into the set.

The space complexity is mainly determined by the number of recursive calls stored in the call stack, which can be up to `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the tiles. Additionally, the set storage can take up to `O(n!)` space in the worst case to store all unique sequences.
