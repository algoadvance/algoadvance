[Leetcode 1775. Equal Sum Arrays With Minimum Number of Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1775)
## Problem Statement

You are given two arrays of integers `nums1` and `nums2`, possibly of different lengths. The task is to make the sums of both arrays equal with the minimum number of operations. In one operation, you can pick any element in any of the arrays and increment or decrement it by 1.

Return the minimum number of operations required to achieve this goal, or -1 if it's not possible.

### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,4,5,6], nums2 = [1,1,2,2,2,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: You can make both arrays sums equal using 3 operations as follows:
- Increase the sum of nums2 by changing one 1 to 6: [1,6,2,2,2,2]
- Increase the sum of nums2 by changing another 1 to 6: [6,6,2,2,2,2]
- Decrease the sum of nums1 by changing one 6 to 1: [1,2,3,4,5,1]
```

### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: nums1 = [1,1,1,1,1,1,1], nums2 = [6]
Output: -1
Explanation: It's not possible to make the sums of both arrays equal.
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums1[i] <= 6`
- `1 <= nums2[i] <= 6`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we modify elements of both `nums1` and `nums2` in a single operation?**
   No, in one operation you can only modify one element of one array.

2. **Is it guaranteed that the arrays will always contain elements in the range [1,6]?**
   Yes, based on the problem constraints.

## Strategy

### Observations:

1. The maximum change an element can undergo in one operation is 5 (e.g., changing 1 to 6 or 6 to 1).
2. Therefore, the number of operations needed may accumulate quickly due to these large potential changes.

### Algorithm:
1. Calculate the sums of both arrays, `sum1` and `sum2`.
2. If `sum1` == `sum2`, return 0 as no operations are needed.
3. Identify which array has the larger sum and focus on either incrementing the smaller-sum array or decrementing the larger-sum array until sums are equal.
4. Utilize a priority-based approach to maximize the sum changes with each operation.

### Steps:
1. Compute initial sums `sum1` and `sum2`.
2. Determine the array with the larger sum and the one with the smaller sum.
3. Create two lists of changes: one for increments (from smaller elements) and one for decrements (from larger elements).
4. Sort these change lists in descending order.
5. Apply the maximum possible changes in each step from either list and adjust the sums accordingly.
6. Count the number of operations and return it, if it reaches target equal sum, otherwise return -1.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        // Calculate sums of both arrays
        int sum1 = Arrays.stream(nums1).sum();
        int sum2 = Arrays.stream(nums2).sum();
        
        // If already equal
        if (sum1 == sum2) return 0;
        
        // Ensure sum1 is always the greater sum and sum2 the lesser
        if (sum1 < sum2) {
            return minOperations(nums2, nums1);
        }
        
        List<Integer> diffs = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int num : nums1) {
            if (num > 1) {
                diffs.add(num - 1);
            }
        }
        for (int num : nums2) {
            if (num < 6) {
                diffs.add(6 - num);
            }
        }
        
        // Sort diffs in descending order
        Collections.sort(diffs, Collections.reverseOrder());
        
        int operations = 0;
        
        for (int diff : diffs) {
            sum1 -= diff;
            operations++;
            if (sum1 <= sum2) {
                return operations;
            }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        
        // Example 1
        int[] nums1_1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
        int[] nums1_2 = {1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 2};
        System.out.println(solution.minOperations(nums1_1, nums1_2)); // Output: 3
        
        // Example 2
        int[] nums2_1 = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1};
        int[] nums2_2 = {6};
        System.out.println(solution.minOperations(nums2_1, nums2_2)); // Output: -1
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Summation of arrays**: O(n + m) where n is the length of `nums1` and m is the length of `nums2`.
- **Creating and sorting diffs**: O((n + m) log(n + m)).
- **Applying changes**: O(n + m).

Hence, the overall time complexity is dominated by **O((n + m) log(n + m))** due to the sorting step.
