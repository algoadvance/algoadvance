[Leetcode 2653. Sliding Subarray Beauty](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2653)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` containing `n` elements, and an integer `k`, the size of the sliding window. Another integer `x` is also given. Each sliding window of size `k` will calculate the `x-th` smallest element from the sorted array which can be negative. You need to output an array of this calculation for every possible sliding window.

### Example:

- Input: `nums = [1, -1, -3, -2, 3, 2, 1], k = 3, x = 2`
- Output: `[-3, -2, -2, -2, 1]`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Do we need to handle cases where `x` is larger than the number of elements in the current window?
   **A:** Assume `x` will always be less than or equal to `k`.

2. **Q:** Can we assume all input values are within normal integer range constraints?
   **A:** Yes, they are within standard integer ranges for most programming environments.

3. **Q:** Do negative integers and the `x-th` smallest among them need special attention?
   **A:** Yes, we might need to handle sorting and ensure the `x-th` smallest includes negatives correctly.

### Strategy

1. Initialize the array to store results.
2. Use a sliding window of size `k`.
3. Collect elements within the window, sort them, and find the `x-th` smallest element.
4. Slide the window one element to the right and repeat until the end of the array.
5. Return the list of x-th smallest elements for each sliding window.

### Code

Below is the Java code for the given problem statement:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class SlidingSubarrayBeauty {
    public static List<Integer> slidingSubarrayBeauty(int[] nums, int k, int x) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        Deque<Integer> deque = new LinkedList<>();
        
        // Create initial window
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            // Remove elements that are out of this window
            while (!deque.isEmpty() && deque.peekFirst() <= i - k) {
                deque.pollFirst();
            }
            // Insert current number maintaining sort order in deque
            while (!deque.isEmpty() && nums[deque.peekLast()] > nums[i]) {
                deque.pollLast();
            }
            deque.offerLast(i);
            // When we've filled the first window, start adding results
            if (i >= k - 1) {
                // Collect the current window in a sorted list to find x-th smallest
                List<Integer> window = new ArrayList<>();
                for (int idx : deque) {
                    window.add(nums[idx]);
                }
                Collections.sort(window);
                result.add(window.get(x - 1));
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {1, -1, -3, -2, 3, 2, 1};
        int k = 3;
        int x = 2;
        List<Integer> result = slidingSubarrayBeauty(nums, k, x);
        System.out.println(result);  // Output: [-3, -2, -2, -2, 1]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Creating the initial window and managing the deque operations take O(n) as each element will be added and removed once.
- Sorting the window each time in `Collections.sort(window)` for each k take O(klogk).
- Thus, the total time complexity for the algorithm is O(n * k * logk).

### Optimizations

Consider using a balanced binary search tree (like `TreeMap`) for the window to maintain the order and retrieve the `x-th` smallest element more efficiently. This change can bring the complexity down to O(n log k).
