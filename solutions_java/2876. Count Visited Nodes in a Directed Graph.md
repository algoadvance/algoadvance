[Leetcode 2876. Count Visited Nodes in a Directed Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2876)
### Problem Statement

You have a directed graph of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, where each node has exactly one outgoing edge. The graph is represented by a given 0-indexed integer array `edges` of size `n`, where `edges[i]` indicates that there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `edges[i]`.

You are also given an array `startNodes` of length `k`. Your task is to return an array `result` of size `k` where `result[i]` is the number of different nodes that can be visited starting from `startNodes[i]`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can a node be visited more than once during traversal from a start node, or should we count unique nodes only?
   - **Only unique nodes should be counted.**
2. Do we need to handle cyclic graphs?
   - **Yes, the graph can contain cycles.**
3. Can `startNodes` contain duplicate values?
   - **Yes, `startNodes` can contain duplicate values.**
4. What should be the output if the graph is empty or if `startNodes` list is empty?
   - **If `startNodes` is empty, return an empty array. If the graph is empty, it is invalid as `n` will be zero.**

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Use the given `edges` array directly to represent the graph.

2. **DFS Traversal**:
   - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to count the number of unique nodes visited starting from each node in `startNodes`.
   - Use a `visited` set to track the nodes visited during the traversal to avoid counting duplicates.
   
3. **Memoization**:
   - Utilize memoization to store the results of nodes that have already been processed to optimize and avoid re-computation.
   
4. **Feedback Handling**:
   - Ensure all nodes are coerced into sets during traversal and only the size of the visited sets is returned.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int[] countVisitedNodes(int[] edges, int[] startNodes) {
        int n = edges.length;
        Map<Integer, Integer> memo = new HashMap<>();
        int[] result = new int[startNodes.length];

        for (int i = 0; i < startNodes.length; i++) {
            result[i] = dfs(edges, startNodes[i], memo, new HashSet<>());
        }

        return result;
    }

    private int dfs(int[] edges, int currentNode, Map<Integer, Integer> memo, Set<Integer> visited) {
        if (memo.containsKey(currentNode)) {
            return memo.get(currentNode);
        }

        if (visited.contains(currentNode)) {
            return 0;
        }

        visited.add(currentNode);
        int count = dfs(edges, edges[currentNode], memo, visited) + 1;

        memo.put(currentNode, count);
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] edges = {1, 2, 0, 4, 5, 3};
        int[] startNodes = {0, 3};

        int[] result = solution.countVisitedNodes(edges, startNodes);

        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(result)); // Expected output: [3, 3]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Worst-case scenario**: Each node will be visited once.
  
  - **DFS traversal**: O(n) for each node in `startNodes`.
  - **Memoization**: Helps to avoid redundant calculations.

  Therefore, the time complexity is **O(n * k)** where `n` is the number of nodes and `k` is the length of `startNodes`.

### Space Complexity

- **Space for visited set**: O(n)
- **Space for memoization map**: O(n)

Overall, the space complexity is **O(n)**.
