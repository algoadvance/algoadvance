[Leetcode 1822. Sign of the Product of an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1822)
### Problem Statement

You are provided with an integer array `nums`. You need to determine the sign of the product of all values in the array `nums`.

- If the product is positive, return `1`.
- If the product is negative, return `-1`.
- If the product is zero, return `0`.

### Example:

1. Input: `nums = [-1,-2,-3,-4,3,2,1]`
   - Output: `1`

2. Input: `nums = [1,5,0,2,-3]`
   - Output: `0`

3. Input: `nums = [-1,1,-1,1,-1]`
   - Output: `-1`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the array contain only one element?
   **A:** Yes, the array can contain only one element.

2. **Q:** Can the input array contain positive, negative, and zero elements?
   **A:** Yes, the input can contain any combination of positive, negative, and zero elements.

3. **Q:** What is the expected size of the input array?
   **A:** The array length can vary, but for the sake of this problem, assume it is within the constraints typically imposed by LeetCode (e.g., up to 1000 elements).

### Strategy

1. **Iterate through the array elements**:
   - If any element is `0`, return `0` immediately because the product will be `0`.
   - Count the number of negative numbers in the array.

2. If the count of negative numbers is odd, the sign of the product will be `-1`. If it's even, the sign will be `1`.

### Time Complexity

- The algorithm requires iterating through the entire array once, making the time complexity `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int arraySign(int[] nums) {
        int negativeCount = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == 0) {
                return 0;
            }
            if (num < 0) {
                negativeCount++;
            }
        }
        
        // If the count of negative numbers is odd, the product is negative
        if (negativeCount % 2 == 1) {
            return -1;
        } else {
            return 1;
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**: We initialize a counter `negativeCount` to keep track of the number of negative elements.
   
2. **Iteration**:
   - For each element `num` in the array `nums`, we check if it is `0`. If it is, we return `0` because the product will be `0`.
   - If `num` is negative, we increment the `negativeCount`.

3. **Return Result**:
   - We check if `negativeCount` is odd or even.
   - If odd, return `-1`, indicating the product is negative.
   - Else, return `1`, indicating the product is positive.

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the sign of the product without actually computing the potentially large product.
