[Leetcode 2465. Number of Distinct Averages full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2465)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, move the elements of `nums` around to form a new array. Return the number of distinct averages you can get.

- The average of an array is the sum of the elements of the array divided by the number of elements in the array.
- When you form a new array `nums[i..j]` from `nums`, then the average of `nums[i..j]` is the integer quotient of the sum of `nums[i..j]` divided by `j-i+1`.

You cannot simply get the averages of all possible subarrays, as this would be too time-consuming.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: Are the elements of the array `nums` guaranteed to be integers?**
   - A: Yes, the elements of the array are integers.

2. **Q: Can the elements of `nums` be negative?**
   - A: Yes, elements in `nums` can be negative.

3. **Q: What should be the result if the array `nums` is empty?**
   - A: If the array `nums` is empty, we should return 0, as there are no elements to form any averages.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Array**: To simplify the problem, we first sort the array `nums`. 
2. **Two-pointer Technique**: Use two pointers, one starting at the beginning (`left`) and one starting at the end (`right`) of the array.
3. **Pair Averages**: Pair the smallest element with the largest element, calculate their average, and insert it into a set to ensure distinct values.
4. **Continue Pairing**: Move the left pointer to the right and the right pointer to the left, and repeat the pairing process until the pointers meet.
5. **Distinct Averages**: The number of distinct averages is simply the size of the set.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class Solution {
    public int distinctAverages(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        Set<Double> averages = new HashSet<>();
        int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
        
        while (left < right) {
            double avg = ((double) nums[left] + nums[right]) / 2;
            averages.add(avg);
            left++;
            right--;
        }

        // If the array has an odd number of elements, handle the middle element
        if (left == right) {
            averages.add((double) nums[left]);
        }
        
        return averages.size();
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: Sorting the array takes `O(n log n)`.
- **Two-pointer traversal**: Traversing the array with two pointers takes `O(n)` since each element is processed exactly once.

Overall, the time complexity of this solution is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step.

### Space Complexity

- **Auxiliary Space**: The primary extra space used is for the `Set` which holds at most `O(n/2)` average values in the worst case.
- Hence, the space complexity is `O(n)`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the number of distinct averages with a time complexity that is optimal for the problem constraints.
