[Leetcode 1909. Remove One Element to Make the Array Strictly Increasing](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1909)
### Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` of length `n`. You need to determine whether it is possible to remove exactly one element from the array to make the rest of the array strictly increasing.

An array `nums` is strictly increasing if `nums[i] < nums[i + 1]` for every index `0 <= i < n - 1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What should be returned if the array is already strictly increasing?
    - We return `true` because we can simply remove an element that would still preserve the strict increasing property.
    
2. What if the array has less than or equal to two elements?
    - For length `<= 2`, we can always remove one element to get a strictly increasing array.

### Strategy
1. Iterate through the array and track instances where `nums[i] >= nums[i+1]`.
2. If more than one such instance is found, return `false` because removing one element will not be enough to make the sequence strictly increasing.
3. If exactly one such instance is found, test two sub-cases:
    - Remove the larger element at the instance.
    - Remove the smaller element next to the instance.
4. Check if either of these sub-cases result in a strictly increasing array.

### Time Complexity
The solution involves a single or at most double pass through the array.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean canBeIncreasing(int[] nums) {
        int count = 0, n = nums.length;
        int idx = -1;

        // Detect the number of points where the sequence is not increasing
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; ++i) {
            if (nums[i] >= nums[i + 1]) {
                count++;
                idx = i;
                if (count > 1) return false;
            }
        }

        // If there are no such points or only one, check the possible cases
        if (count == 0) return true;
        if (idx == 0 || idx == n - 2) return true;

        if ((idx > 0 && nums[idx - 1] < nums[idx + 1]) ||
            (idx < n - 2 && nums[idx] < nums[idx + 2])) {
            return true;
        }

        return false;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();

        // Test with sample inputs
        System.out.println(sol.canBeIncreasing(new int[]{1, 2, 10, 5, 7})); // true
        System.out.println(sol.canBeIncreasing(new int[]{2, 3, 1, 2}));    // false
        System.out.println(sol.canBeIncreasing(new int[]{1, 1, 1}));        // false
        System.out.println(sol.canBeIncreasing(new int[]{1, 2, 3}));        // true
    }
}
```

The provided solution should adequately handle the problem and edge cases like smaller arrays or typical elements that maintain a stable comparison for strictly increasing subarray creation.
