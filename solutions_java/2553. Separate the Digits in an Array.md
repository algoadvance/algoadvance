[Leetcode 2553. Separate the Digits in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2553)
## Problem Statement
Given an array of positive integers `nums`, return an array `answer` that consists of the digits of each integer in `nums` after separating them in the same order they appear in `nums`.

**Example:**
```text
Input: nums = [13, 25, 83, 77]
Output: [1, 3, 2, 5, 8, 3, 7, 7]
Explanation: 
- The digits of 13 are [1, 3]
- The digits of 25 are [2, 5]
- The digits of 83 are [8, 3]
- The digits of 77 are [7, 7]
Hence, the answer is [1, 3, 2, 5, 8, 3, 7, 7]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are all numbers in the input array `nums` positive integers?**
   - Yes, based on the problem, all integers in `nums` are positive.
   
2. **Do we need to maintain the order of digits as they appear in each number?**
   - Yes, we should maintain the order of digits as they appear in each individual number in the array.

3. **Can the array `nums` be empty?**
   - Based on the problem constraints, it is possible but unlikely. If it's empty, we would return an empty array as well.

## Strategy
1. Initialize an empty list `answer` that will store the separated digits.
2. Iterate through each number in the given array `nums`.
3. For each number, convert it to a string to easily access each digit.
4. Convert each character back to an integer and append it to the `answer` list.
5. Return the `answer` list.

## Code
Here's how we can achieve this in Java:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class SeparateDigits {
    public static List<Integer> separateDigits(int[] nums) {
        List<Integer> answer = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            String numStr = String.valueOf(num);
            for (char digitChar : numStr.toCharArray()) {
                answer.add(Character.getNumericValue(digitChar));
            }
        }
        return answer;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {13, 25, 83, 77};
        System.out.println(separateDigits(nums)); // Output: [1, 3, 2, 5, 8, 3, 7, 7]
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(N * M), where N is the number of integers in `nums` and M is the average number of digits in each integer. Converting each number to a string takes O(M) time, and iterating over the list of digits also takes O(M) time for each number.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N * M), where N is the number of integers and M is the average digit count per integer. The space is primarily used to store the resultant list of digits (`answer`).

This solution efficiently separates the digits while maintaining the order and handles all constraints provided by the problem.
