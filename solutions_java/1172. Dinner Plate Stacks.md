[Leetcode 1172. Dinner Plate Stacks](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1172)
## Problem Statement

You have an infinite number of stacks arranged in a row and indexed from left to right. Initially, each stack is empty, but you can perform the following operations:

1. `DinnerPlates(int capacity)` - Initializes the object with the maximum capacity of each stack.
2. `void push(int val)` - Pushes the integer `val` into the leftmost stack that is not full.
3. `int pop()` - Returns the value at the top of the rightmost non-empty stack and removes it from that stack. If all stacks are empty, returns -1.
4. `int popAtStack(int index)` - Returns the value at the top of the stack with the given index and removes it from that stack. If the stack with the given index is empty, returns -1.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum capacity of each stack?**
   - This is specified by the capacity argument in the constructor.

2. **Are there constraints on the number of operations or the values that can be pushed?**
   - Input and output constraints are not specified, but typically you should assume operations could be numerous and need efficient handling.

3. **What is the maximum number of stacks that can exist?**
   - The number of stacks grows dynamically as needed, and there's no explicit upper limit.

## Code

Below is the Java code implementation for the given problem:

```java
import java.util.TreeSet;
import java.util.Stack;
import java.util.ArrayList;

class DinnerPlates {

    private int capacity;
    private ArrayList<Stack<Integer>> stacks;
    private TreeSet<Integer> availablePushIndices;

    public DinnerPlates(int capacity) {
        this.capacity = capacity;
        this.stacks = new ArrayList<>();
        this.availablePushIndices = new TreeSet<>();
    }

    public void push(int val) {
        if (availablePushIndices.isEmpty()) {
            Stack<Integer> newStack = new Stack<>();
            newStack.push(val);
            stacks.add(newStack);
            if (newStack.size() < capacity) {
                availablePushIndices.add(stacks.size() - 1);
            }
        } else {
            int idx = availablePushIndices.first();
            stacks.get(idx).push(val);
            if (stacks.get(idx).size() == capacity) {
                availablePushIndices.pollFirst();
            }
        }
    }

    public int pop() {
        while (!stacks.isEmpty() && stacks.get(stacks.size() - 1).isEmpty()) {
            stacks.remove(stacks.size() - 1);
            availablePushIndices.remove(stacks.size());
        }
        if (stacks.isEmpty()) return -1;
        int val = stacks.get(stacks.size() - 1).pop();
        availablePushIndices.add(stacks.size() - 1);
        return val;
    }

    public int popAtStack(int index) {
        if (index < 0 || index >= stacks.size() || stacks.get(index).isEmpty()) return -1;
        int val = stacks.get(index).pop();
        availablePushIndices.add(index);
        return val;
    }
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - `DinnerPlates(int capacity)` initializes a list of stacks and sets the capacity for each stack.
   
2. **Push Operation:**
   - Use a `TreeSet` to keep track of indices of stacks that are not full.
   - When pushing a value, find the leftmost stack that is not full using `TreeSet`. If all are full, create a new stack.
   
3. **Pop Operation:**
   - Remove elements from the top of the rightmost non-empty stack.
   - If the stack becomes empty, remove it from consideration and remove its index from the `TreeSet`.

4. **Pop at Specific Stack:**
   - Directly access the stack at the given index and pop the element.
   - Mark the index for potential future pushes using the `TreeSet`.

## Time Complexity

- **Push Operation:**
  - `O(log n)` due to the `TreeSet` operations for maintaining indices.
  
- **Pop Operation:**
  - `O(log n)` in the worst case as it might involve TreeSet adjustments.
  
- **Pop at Specific Stack:**
  - `O(1)` for direct access to the stack, but `O(log n)` for adjusting the `TreeSet`.

This approach ensures that all operations are efficient and manageable within the constraints typically expected in competitive programming problems.
