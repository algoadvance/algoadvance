[Leetcode 859. Buddy Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l859)
### Problem Statement

You are given two strings `s` and `goal`. Your task is to determine if you can obtain the string `goal` by swapping two letters in the string `s`.

Return `true` if it is possible, otherwise return `false`.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "ab", goal = "ba"
Output: true
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "ab", goal = "ab"
Output: false
```

Example 3:
```
Input: s = "aa", goal = "aa"
Output: true
```

Example 4:
```
Input: s = "aaaaaaabc", goal = "aaaaaaacb"
Output: true
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. What are the constraints on the lengths of `s` and `goal`?
   - Both `s` and `goal` have lengths between 1 and 2 * 10^4.
   
2. What character set do `s` and `goal` use?
   - Both strings consist of lowercase English letters only.

3. What should be the behavior if `s` and `goal` are of different lengths?
   - If the lengths are different, it should return `false` immediately.

### Strategy

1. If the lengths of `s` and `goal` are different, return `false`.
2. If `s` is equal to `goal`, check if `s` contains any duplicate character. If there are duplicates, return `true` because swapping the duplicates will result in the same string.
3. If `s` is not equal to `goal`:
   - Identify the indices where `s` and `goal` differ.
   - If the number of differing positions is not exactly 2, return `false` because only one swap is allowed.
   - Check if swapping these differing characters in `s` will make it equal to `goal`.

### Code

```java
public class BuddyStrings {
    public boolean buddyStrings(String s, String goal) {
        // Step 1: Check length
        if (s.length() != goal.length()) {
            return false;
        }

        // Step 2: If strings are equal, check for duplicate characters
        if (s.equals(goal)) {
            int[] count = new int[26];
            for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
                count[c - 'a']++;
                if (count[c - 'a'] > 1) {  // If any character appears more than once
                    return true;
                }
            }
            return false;  // No duplicate characters found
        }

        // Step 3: Find indices where characters differ
        int first = -1, second = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) != goal.charAt(i)) {
                if (first == -1) {
                    first = i;
                } else if (second == -1) {
                    second = i;
                } else {
                    return false;  // More than 2 differences
                }
            }
        }

        // Step 4: Check if swapping makes the strings equal
        return (second != -1 && 
                s.charAt(first) == goal.charAt(second) && 
                s.charAt(second) == goal.charAt(first));
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is O(N), where N is the length of the string `s` or `goal`. This is because we either iterate through the string once to compare characters or to count duplicate characters.
- The space complexity is O(1) because the auxiliary space used is constant (an array of size 26 to keep count of characters).

This solution should be efficient and handle the constraints specified in the problem statement effectively.
