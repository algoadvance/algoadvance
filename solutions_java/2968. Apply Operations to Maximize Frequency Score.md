[Leetcode 2968. Apply Operations to Maximize Frequency Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2968)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integer arrays `arr` where `arr[i]` represents a specific list of integers. Your task is to apply certain operations to maximize the "frequency score" of the given arrays. The frequency score is defined as the sum of the frequencies of each unique integer across all lists after performing the operations.

Operations allowed:
1. Insert an integer into any list (increases the integer's frequency by 1).
2. Remove an integer from any list (decreases the integer's frequency by 1).

You are to maximize the frequency score after these operations. Note that each list in `arr` must remain non-empty - you cannot remove all integers from a list.

Return the maximum frequency score you can obtain.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on the size of the input arrays and elements value:** 
   - What is the range of lengths for the main array `arr` and the individual sub-arrays?
   - What is the range of values that the integers in the sub-arrays can take?
   - Is there any limit on the number of operations that can be conducted?

2. **Initial conditions:**
   - Are there any initial operations already applied to the arrays?
   - Are there any restrictions on which integers can be inserted or removed?

3. **Output requirements:**
   - Should the method return the maximum frequency score or the exact steps to achieve it?

### Strategy

The strategy involves these steps:

1. **Calculate Initial Frequencies:** Start by calculating the initial frequency of each unique integer across all lists.
2. **Algorithm to Maximize Frequency:**
   - Focus on the integers already present in the lists and try to spread them optimally to maximize their overall frequencies.
   - Avoid making lists empty.
3. **Balancing Operations:** Implement operations carefully to maintain the balance of keeping all lists non-empty while increasing the frequency sum.

### Time Complexity

- Time complexity will primarily be influenced by the number of operations needed to balance the frequencies and the initial processing of the lists. 
- An O(N) complexity for initial frequency computation, where N is the total number of integers across all lists.
- Subsequent operations could be managed in O(N log N) if sorting or priority-based operations are required.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MaximizeFrequencyScore {
    
    public int maximizeFrequencyScore(int[][] arr) {
        // Map to store the frequency of each number across all lists
        Map<Integer, Integer> freqMap = new HashMap<>();
        int totalNums = 0;
        
        // Populate the frequency map
        for (int[] list : arr) {
            for (int num : list) {
                freqMap.put(num, freqMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
                totalNums++;
            }
        }
        
        // Create a priority queue (min-heap) for balancing frequency
        PriorityQueue<Map.Entry<Integer, Integer>> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(
            Comparator.comparingInt(Map.Entry::getValue)
        );
        
        // Add all entries to the heap
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : freqMap.entrySet()) {
            minHeap.offer(entry);
        }
        
        // Calculate the initial frequency score
        int maxFrequencyScore = 0;
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : minHeap) {
            maxFrequencyScore += entry.getValue();
        }
        
        // Perform operations to balance and maximize frequency score
        while (totalNums > 0) {
            // This block is for illustration and might require further logic based on operations allowed
            Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> leastFrequent = minHeap.poll();
            if (leastFrequent != null && leastFrequent.getValue() < some_threshold) {
                // Perform operations to balance frequencies
                
                // After adjusting operations, re-calculate the maxFrequencyScore
                maxFrequencyScore = 0;
                for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : minHeap) {
                    maxFrequencyScore += entry.getValue();
                }
            } else {
                break; // If no more operations can be beneficial, break
            }
        }
        
        return maxFrequencyScore;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximizeFrequencyScore mfs = new MaximizeFrequencyScore();
        int[][] arr = \ use example from above
        System.out.println("Max Frequency Score: " + mfs.maximizeFrequencyScore(arr));
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity Analysis

- **Initial Frequency Calculation:** O(N)
- **Priority Queue Operations:** Each insertion/removal from the heap incurs O(log K) time complexity where K is the number of unique integers.
- **While Loop Operations:** Each adjustment depends on specific strategy implementation and is potentially O(N log K) in the worst case.

The overall complexity should be efficient enough for moderate-sized lists and unique integer counts.
