[Leetcode 2864. Maximum Odd Binary Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2864)
## Problem Statement

You are given a binary string `s` (possibly with leading zeros), which represents a binary number. Your task is to rearrange the bits in the string to get the maximum odd binary number possible. The output should also be a binary string. A binary number is odd if its last digit is 1.

### Example:
1. Input: `s = "010"`
   Output: `s = "100"`
2. Input: `s = "1011"`
   Output: `s = "1110"`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the string `s` be empty?**
   - No, it is guaranteed that the string `s` will have at least one character.

2. **What characters can be in the string `s`?**
   - The string `s` will only contain '0' and '1' characters.

3. **Is there an upper limit on the length of the string `s`?**
   - The problem does not specify an upper limit. Assume it can be reasonably large within practical execution constraints.

4. **Should the output retain any specific formatting?**
   - The output should be a binary string which represents the maximum odd number obtainable by rearranging the bits.

## Strategy

1. **Count the number of `0`s and `1`s in the string**: Determine the frequency of `0`s and `1`s in the string `s`.
2. **Formulate the binary string**:
    - The largest binary number has the most significant bit as 1. Hence, we need to keep as many `1`s as possible at the most significant positions.
    - To ensure the number is odd, the least significant bit should be `1`.

3. **Construct the result string**:
    - Place all remaining `1`s at the beginning (except one which will be placed at the end to ensure odd number).
    - Place all `0`s next.
    - End the string with a single `1` to ensure the number is odd.

## Code

```java
public class MaximumOddBinaryNumber {
    public static String maximumOddBinaryNumber(String s) {
        int count1s = 0;
        int count0s = 0;
        
        for(char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '1') {
                count1s++;
            } else {
                count0s++;
            }
        }
        
        if (count1s == 0) {
            return "0"; // No way to get an odd number, default to "0" (though constraints guarantee at least one character).
        }
        
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        
        // Add all but one '1' at the start
        for (int i = 0; i < count1s - 1; i++) {
            result.append('1');
        }
        
        // Add all '0's
        for (int i = 0; i < count0s; i++) {
            result.append('0');
        }
        
        // Finally, add the last '1' to make the number odd
        result.append('1');
        
        return result.toString();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s1 = "010";
        System.out.println(maximumOddBinaryNumber(s1)); // Output: "100"
        
        String s2 = "1011";
        System.out.println(maximumOddBinaryNumber(s2)); // Output: "1110"
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This complexity arises from:
- Counting the '1's and '0's in the string (O(n)).
- Constructing the result string using the count of '1's and '0's (O(n)).

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and works within the constraints of the problem.
