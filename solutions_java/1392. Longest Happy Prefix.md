[Leetcode 1392. Longest Happy Prefix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1392)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return the longest happy prefix of `s`. A string is called a **happy prefix** if it is a non-empty prefix that is also a suffix (excluding the entire string itself). If there is no such prefix, return an empty string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the string contain special characters or spaces?**
   - According to standard interpretations and examples, it usually contains only lowercase English letters. But, let's assume all characters unless specified otherwise.

2. **What is the range of the string length?**
   - Strings can be very large, potentially in the range of thousands or more.

3. **Do we need to handle any specific case-sensitive issues?**
   - No, we assume the string has consistent casing as per problem statement.

### Strategy

To find the longest happy prefix, we'll use an approach similar to generating the Longest Prefix Suffix (LPS) array used in the KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) pattern matching algorithm. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Generate the LPS Array**: The LPS array stores the length of the longest proper prefix which is also a suffix for substring `s` ending at different positions.
2. **Iterate over the string**: Compute values for the LPS array.
3. **Extract the result**: Use the last value of the LPS array to determine the longest happy prefix.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public String longestPrefix(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[] lps = new int[n];
        
        // length of the previous longest prefix suffix
        int length = 0;
        int i = 1;
        
        // Fill lps array
        while (i < n) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(length)) {
                length++;
                lps[i] = length;
                i++;
            } else {
                if (length != 0) {
                    length = lps[length - 1];
                } else {
                    lps[i] = 0;
                    i++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // The longest happy prefix length is found at the last index of lps array
        int happyPrefixLength = lps[n - 1];
        return s.substring(0, happyPrefixLength);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string. We are iterating through the string to build the LPS array, resulting in linear time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for storing the LPS array.

This solution efficiently computes the longest happy prefix using linear time and space, making it well-suited for large input strings.
