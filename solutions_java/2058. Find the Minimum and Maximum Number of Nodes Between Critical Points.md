[Leetcode 2058. Find the Minimum and Maximum Number of Nodes Between Critical Points](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2058)
### Problem Statement:

You are given the head of a linked list. A critical point in the linked list is defined as either a local maxima or a local minima. 

- A node is a local maxima if the current node's value is greater than its next and previous node's values.
- A node is a local minima if the current node's value is smaller than its next and previous node's values.

You need to find the minimum and maximum distance between any two critical points. If there are fewer than two critical points, return `[-1, -1]`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Format**:
   - Is the list singly or doubly linked?
   - Will the list always have at least one node?
   
2. **Output Format**:
   - Can you confirm that if fewer than two critical points are found, the output should strictly be `[-1, -1]`?

3. **Values Range**:
   - Is there any specific range for the node values in the linked list?

For simplicity, let's assume the list is singly linked and always has at least one node.

### Strategy:

1. Traverse the linked list, keeping track of the current index.
2. Identify critical points by comparing each node's value with the values of its previous and next nodes.
3. Store the indices of all critical points in an array.
4. If fewer than two critical points are found, return `[-1, -1]`.
5. Calculate the minimum and maximum distances between any two critical points:
   - For the minimum distance, find the smallest difference between consecutive indices in the critical points array.
   - For the maximum distance, it's simply the difference between the first and last indices in the critical points array.

### Code:

```java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
}

public class Solution {
    public int[] nodesBetweenCriticalPoints(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null || head.next.next == null) {
            return new int[]{-1, -1};
        }

        int index = 0;
        ListNode prev = head;
        ListNode curr = head.next;
        ListNode next = curr.next;

        int firstCriticalPoint = -1;
        int lastCriticalPoint = -1;
        int minDistance = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        while (next != null) {
            index++;
            if ((curr.val > prev.val && curr.val > next.val) || (curr.val < prev.val && curr.val < next.val)) {
                if (firstCriticalPoint == -1) {
                    firstCriticalPoint = index;
                } else {
                    minDistance = Math.min(minDistance, index - lastCriticalPoint);
                }
                lastCriticalPoint = index;
            }
            prev = curr;
            curr = next;
            next = next.next;
        }

        if (firstCriticalPoint == lastCriticalPoint || firstCriticalPoint == -1) {
            return new int[]{-1, -1};
        }

        return new int[]{minDistance, lastCriticalPoint - firstCriticalPoint};
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test cases can be run here
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because we only traverse the list once.
- The space complexity is O(1) (since we use a fixed amount of extra space).

This solution efficiently finds and processes critical points in a single pass, making it optimal for the problem requirements.
