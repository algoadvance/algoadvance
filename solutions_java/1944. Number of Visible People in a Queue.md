[Leetcode 1944. Number of Visible People in a Queue](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1944)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `heights` representing a queue of people standing in a line. The `i-th` person is represented by `heights[i]` and wants to see the stage.

Each person `i` can see the stage if there is no taller person standing in front of them. More formally, for each person `i` (from `0` to `n-1`), you need to determine the number of people standing in front of `i` who can be seen by `i` before a taller or equal height person blocks the view.

Return an array `answer` of the same length where `answer[i]` is the number of people the `i-th` person can see.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of the length of the `heights` array?
   - What values can the elements of the `heights` array take?

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Should the output array be of the same length as the input array?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - How should we handle the case where the array `heights` has only one person?
   - Should we consider scenarios where all persons have the same height?

### Strategy

We can use a stack-based approach to solve this problem efficiently. Here's the plan:

1. We'll initialize an empty stack and an array `answer` of the same length as `heights` with all elements set to `0`.
2. We'll iterate through the `heights` array from right to left.
3. For each person `i`, we'll pop elements from the stack until we find a person taller than `heights[i]` or the stack is empty.
4. The number of elements popped from the stack is the number of persons `i` can see.
5. We push the current person's height into the stack afterward.

This approach ensures we only go through each person once with additional stack operations.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of people in the `heights` array. Each person is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case scenario for the stack.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class Solution {
    public int[] canSeePersonsCount(int[] heights) {
        int n = heights.length;
        int[] answer = new int[n];
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int count = 0;
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() < heights[i]) {
                stack.pop();
                count++;
            }
            if (!stack.isEmpty()) {
                count++;
            }
            answer[i] = count;
            stack.push(heights[i]);
        }

        return answer;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] heights = {10, 6, 8, 5, 11, 9};
        int[] result = sol.canSeePersonsCount(heights);
        for (int x : result) {
            System.out.print(x + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- We use a stack to keep track of heights we've encountered so far, iterating from the end of the array to the beginning.
- For each person at index `i`, we count how many people they can see by popping shorter heights from the stack until a taller height is encountered.
- The number of pops gives us the count of visible persons.
- We then update the result and push the current height to the stack for future consideration.
