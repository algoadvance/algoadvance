[Leetcode 598. Range Addition II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l598)
Sure, let's go through the problem step by step.

### Problem Statement
The problem is as follows:

You are given an `m x n` matrix `M` initialized with all `0`'s and are given several update operations.

Each operation is represented by a tuple `(a, b)`, which means all cells `(i, j)` for `0 <= i < a` and `0 <= j < b` should be incremented by `1`.

You need to find the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations.

**Example:**

```txt
Input:
m = 3, n = 3
operations = [[2,2],[3,3]]
Output:
4

Explanation:
Initially, M = 
[[0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0],
 [0, 0, 0]]

After performing [2,2], M = 
[[1, 1, 0],
 [1, 1, 0],
 0, 0, 0]]

After performing [3,3], M = 
[[2, 2, 1],
 [2, 2, 1],
 [1, 1, 1]]

The maximum integer in M is 2, and there are 4 of it in M.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the matrix dimensions `m` and `n` be zero? (Assumption: No, they are always positive integers)
2. Can the `operations` list be empty? (Assumption: Yes, if no operations are applied, the matrix remains with all elements as `0`)
3. Are `a` and `b` always within the bounds of the matrix dimensions? (Assumption: Yes)

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, instead of simulating the entire matrix operations, which could be computationally expensive, note the following key insight:
- Since each operation `(a, b)` increments all elements in a submatrix of size `a x b`, the cells that have been incremented the most times will be those in the intersection of the smallest values of `a` and `b` for all operations.

Thus:
1. Track the minimum value of `a` (let's call it `minA`).
2. Track the minimum value of `b` (let's call it `minB`).
3. The number of maximum integers will then be the area of this intersection submatrix, which is `minA * minB`.

### Code
Here is the Java code implementing the strategy:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxCount(int m, int n, int[][] ops) {
        // If ops is empty, the maximum number doesn't change the entire grid, so it's m * n.
        if (ops.length == 0) return m * n;
        
        int minA = m;
        int minB = n;
        
        // Iterate over all the operations to find the smallest a and b
        for (int[] op : ops) {
            minA = Math.min(minA, op[0]);
            minB = Math.min(minB, op[1]);
        }
        
        // The area of the top-left sub-matrix affected by all operations 
        return minA * minB;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is:
- \(O(K)\), where `K` is the number of operations since we only perform a single loop over the operations array.

The space complexity is:
- \(O(1)\) since we only use a few extra variables for tracking the minimum values.

This solution ensures we handle the problem efficiently both in terms of time and space.
