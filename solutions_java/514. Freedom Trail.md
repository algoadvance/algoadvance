[Leetcode 514. Freedom Trail](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l514)
### Problem Statement:
The problem is defined as follows:

In the video game Fallout 4, the quest "Road to Freedom" requires players to reach a metal dial called the "Freedom Trail Ring", and use the dial to spell a specific keyword to get into a secret room. Given the dial, which is a circular ring with certain characters and a keyword, you need to find the minimum number of steps to spell the keyword by rotating the dial and pressing the center button of the ring for each character.

The dial can be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise one character at a time, and you can start from any character in the initial dial position.

**Input:**
- A string `ring` - represents the characters on the ring.
- A string `key` - represents the keyword you need to spell.

**Output:**
- An integer representing the minimum number of steps to spell all characters in `key`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Are there any constraints on the length of `ring` and `key`?
2. Can `ring` contain duplicate characters, and is it case-sensitive?
3. What is the starting position on the ring?
4. Are we restricted to pressing each character exactly once in sequence?

### Code:
```java
public class FreedomTrail {
    public int findRotateSteps(String ring, String key) {
        int m = ring.length();
        int n = key.length();
        
        // Create a Map to store the indices of each character in the ring
        Map<Character, List<Integer>> charIndices = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            charIndices.computeIfAbsent(ring.charAt(i), k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(i);
        }
        
        // dp[i][j] represents the minimal steps needed to spell key[j:] with ring[i] as the starting point
        int[][] dp = new int[m][n+1];
        for (int[] arr : dp) Arrays.fill(arr, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        
        // Initialize the base case where j (key index) is the last character
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            dp[i][n] = 0;
        }
        
        // Iterate from the end of the key to the beginning
        for (int j = n - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
                for (int next : charIndices.get(key.charAt(j))) {
                    int dist = Math.abs(next - i);
                    int minDist = Math.min(dist, m - dist);
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], 1 + minDist + dp[next][j + 1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // The minimal steps needed to spell the entire key starting from pointer at ring[0]
        return dp[0][0];
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FreedomTrail solver = new FreedomTrail();
        String ring = "godding";
        String key = "gd";
        System.out.println(solver.findRotateSteps(ring, key)); // Output: 4
    }
}
```

### Strategy:
1. **Dynamic Programming (DP):**
   - Use a 2D DP array `dp[i][j]` where `i` is the ring position and `j` is the position in the keyword.
   - `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum steps required to spell the substring `key[j:]` starting from `ring[i]`.
   - Initialize the base case where `j` is the length of the key, meaning no more characters to spell, so `dp[i][n] = 0` for all `i`.
   - Populate the DP table by iterating backwards through the keyword. Use `charIndices` to store indices of each character in the ring to enhance efficiency.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - For each position in the ring, calculate the minimum rotation distance to the desired character. Account for both clockwise and counterclockwise distances.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n * k), where `m` is the length of the ring, `n` is the length of the key, and `k` is the average number of occurrences of each character in the ring.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) for the DP table.

This solution ensures efficient computation by leveraging dynamic programming and pre-processing steps to minimize redundant computations.
