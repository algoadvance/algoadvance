[Leetcode 1663. Smallest String With A Given Numeric Value](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1663)
### Problem Statement

**1663. Smallest String With A Given Numeric Value**

The problem asks to generate the lexicographically smallest string with a given numeric value.

- You are given two integers n and k. 
- Return the lexicographically smallest string with length equal to n and numeric value equal to k.

The numeric value of a string is defined as the sum of its characters' positions in the alphabet. For example, the numeric value of the string "abc" is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`, and the numeric value of the string "abcd" is `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the inputs `n` and `k` always positive integers?
   - Yes, both n and k are guaranteed to be positive integers.
2. What are the constraints on the values of `n` and `k`?
   - This problem does not specify constraints, but typically constraints are such that brute force approaches might not work efficiently.

### Strategy

To construct the desired string:
1. **Initialize the String**: Start with a string of length `n` filled with 'a's since 'a' is the smallest lexicographical character and has the smallest numeric value (1).
2. **Adjust the Last Characters**: Gradually increase the value of the characters from the back of the string to meet the required total value `k`. 
3. **Calculate Remainder**: For each position from the end, increase the character to its maximum possible value such that it contributes to the total value without exceeding `k`.

### Plan

1. Create a string of length `n` filled with 'a's.
2. Calculate the remaining value we need to add to reach `k` (initially `k - n` because each 'a' contributes 1 to the numeric value).
3. Iterate from the end of the string towards the front.
4. For each position, calculate the maximum value it can be increased to (up to 'z').
5. Adjust that character and reduce the remaining additive value accordingly.
6. Continue until the entire string is appropriately adjusted.

### Code

```java
public class SmallestStringWithNumericValue {
    public String getSmallestString(int n, int k) {
        char[] result = new char[n];
        int remainingValue = k - n;

        // Initialize all characters of the result as 'a'
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            result[i] = 'a';
        }

        // Process from the rightmost character
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0 && remainingValue > 0; i--) {
            int maxAdditionToCurrentChar = Math.min(25, remainingValue); // max we can add without exceeding 'z'
            result[i] += maxAdditionToCurrentChar;
            remainingValue -= maxAdditionToCurrentChar;
        }

        return new String(result);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SmallestStringWithNumericValue obj = new SmallestStringWithNumericValue();
        int n = 5, k = 73;
        System.out.println(obj.getSmallestString(n, k)); // Output: "aaszz"
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. The algorithm iterates through the characters of the string once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), which is the space needed to store the resulting string.

The above approach ensures that we construct the smallest lexicographical string efficiently by utilizing the smallest characters first and increasing the necessary characters from the end to create the desired numeric value.
