[Leetcode 572. Subtree of Another Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l572)
## Problem Statement:

Given the roots of two binary trees `root` and `subRoot`, determine if there is a subtree of `root` with the same structure and node values of `subRoot`. A subtree of a binary tree `tree` is a tree that consists of a node in `tree` and all of this node's descendants. The tree `tree` could also be considered as a subtree of itself.

### Example:

1. Example 1:
    - Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2], subRoot = [4,1,2]
    - Output: true
2. Example 2:
    - Input: root = [3,4,5,1,2,null,null,0], subRoot = [4,1,2]
    - Output: false

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Can both `root` and `subRoot` be `null`?**
    - Yes, if both are null, return `true`.
2. **If `subRoot` is `null` but `root` is not, what should the output be?**
    - If `subRoot` is `null`, it should always return `true` regardless of `root`.
3. **If `root` is `null` but `subRoot` is not, what should the output be?**
    - If `root` is `null` but `subRoot` is not, it should return `false`.

## Strategy:

1. **Equality Function**: Define a helper function `isSameTree` to check if two trees are identical.
2. **Traversal and Subtree Check**:
    - Traverse through each node in the main tree (`root`).
    - For each node in `root`, check if the subtree starting at that node is equal to `subRoot` using the `isSameTree` function.
    - Return `true` if any subtree matches, otherwise return `false`.

## Code:

```java
// TreeNode class definition
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode() {}
    TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
    TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

public class Solution {
    public boolean isSubtree(TreeNode root, TreeNode subRoot) {
        if (root == null && subRoot == null) return true;
        if (root == null) return false;
        
        return isSameTree(root, subRoot) || isSubtree(root.left, subRoot) || isSubtree(root.right, subRoot);
    }

    private boolean isSameTree(TreeNode s, TreeNode t) {
        if (s == null && t == null) return true;
        if (s == null || t == null) return false;
        if (s.val != t.val) return false;
        
        return isSameTree(s.left, t.left) && isSameTree(s.right, t.right);
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:

- **isSameTree Function**: 
    - To compare two subtrees takes \(O(m)\) time where \(m\) is the number of nodes in the subtree.
- **isSubtree Function**:
    - This function essentially visits every node in `root` and calls `isSameTree` which takes \(O(m)\) time for each node. 
    - Thus, the total time complexity is \(O(n * m)\) where \(n\) is the number of nodes in `root` and \(m\) is the number of nodes in `subRoot`.

The given solution efficiently checks subtrees using recursive techniques, ensuring each possible subtree is validated against `subRoot`.
