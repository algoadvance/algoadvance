[Leetcode 1525. Number of Good Ways to Split a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1525)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s`. A split is defined as separating the string into two non-empty substrings `left` and `right`. A split is considered good if the number of unique characters in the left substring is equal to the number of unique characters in the right substring.

Return the number of good splits you can make in the string `s`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of Input String**:
   - What is the maximum length of the input string `s`?
     - The length is `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`.
   
2. **Character Set**:
   - Does the string contain only lowercase English letters?
     - Yes, it's mentioned that `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.

3. **Empty Strings**:
   - Are both substrings non-empty after the split?
     - Yes, both substrings must be non-empty.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to keep track of the number of unique characters in both the left and right substrings for each possible split point.

We can achieve this using the following approach:
1. **Count Total Unique Characters**: Traverse the string to get counts of each character.
2. **Sliding Window Approach**: Use a sliding window to maintain the number of unique characters in the left and right substrings as you iterate through each possible split point.

Here's a detailed step-by-step strategy:
1. **Count Characters on Right Side Initially**:
   - Create an array or a dictionary to keep track of the count of each character in the right substring (initially the whole string).
   - Create another structure to keep track of the number of unique characters in the right substring.
2. **Iterate and Adjust Counts**:
   - Traverse through the string while adjusting the counts of characters from the right to the left.
   - Track the unique counts for both sides as you make each split.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    public int numSplits(String s) {
        // Maps to store character counts in left and right substrings
        Map<Character, Integer> leftCount = new HashMap<>();
        Map<Character, Integer> rightCount = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Populate the rightCount with all characters initially
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            rightCount.put(ch, rightCount.getOrDefault(ch, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        int goodSplits = 0;
        int uniqueLeft = 0;
        int uniqueRight = rightCount.size(); // Initial unique characters in the whole string
        
        // Iterate over each possible split
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            // Move character from right to left
            rightCount.put(ch, rightCount.get(ch) - 1);
            if (rightCount.get(ch) == 0) {
                rightCount.remove(ch);
                uniqueRight--; // Decrease unique count if a character count reaches zero
            }
            
            // Add character to left
            leftCount.put(ch, leftCount.getOrDefault(ch, 0) + 1);
            if (leftCount.get(ch) == 1) {
                uniqueLeft++; // Increase unique count for the left
            }
            
            // Compare unique characters in left and right
            if (uniqueLeft == uniqueRight) {
                goodSplits++;
            }
        }
        
        return goodSplits;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string. Each character is processed at most twice (once when counted and once when moved between sides).
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, since the character set is fixed at 26 (lowercase English letters). The space required for the maps doesn't grow with the input size but remains constant.

This approach efficiently determines the number of good splits in linear time by leveraging hash maps to maintain character counts dynamically.
