[Leetcode 399. Evaluate Division](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l399)
## Problem Statement:
You are given equations in the format `A / B = k`, where `A` and `B` are variables represented as strings, and `k` is a real number (floating point). Given some queries, return the answers. If the answer does not exist, return `-1.0`.

The input is always valid. You may assume that evaluating the queries will result in no division by zero and there is no contradiction.

### Example:
```
Input: 
equations = [ ["a", "b"], ["b", "c"] ], values = [2.0, 3.0], queries = [ ["a", "c"], ["b", "a"], ["a", "e"], ["a", "a"], ["x", "x"] ]
Output: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0]
Explanation: 
Given: a / b = 2.0, b / c = 3.0
queries are:
a / c = ? , b / a = ? , a / e = ? , a / a = ? , x / x = ? 
results: 6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0
```

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Are the variables in the equations guaranteed to be lower case letters?
2. Can the length of `equations` and `queries` be very large?
3. Is there any specific precision requirement for the results?

## Strategy:
1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Model the problem as a graph. Each variable is a node, and a directed edge (`A -> B`) represents the division relationship (`A / B = k`).

2. **Graph Construction**:
   - Construct the graph using given equations and values. For each equation `A / B = k`, add edges `A -> B` with weight `k` and `B -> A` with weight `1/k`.

3. **Query Evaluation using DFS**:
   - For each query `A / B`, use Depth-First Search (DFS) to find a path from `A` to `B` and keep track of the product of edge weights along the path.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - A node divided by itself returns 1.0.
   - If either variable in the query doesn't exist in the graph, return -1.0.
   - Handle cases where there is no path between the two variables in the query.

## Code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class EvaluateDivision {
    
    class Node {
        String dest;
        double value;
        Node(String dest, double value) {
            this.dest = dest;
            this.value = value;
        }
    }
    
    public double[] calcEquation(List<List<String>> equations, double[] values, List<List<String>> queries) {
        Map<String, List<Node>> graph = new HashMap<>();

        // Build the graph
        for (int i = 0; i < equations.size(); i++) {
            String u = equations.get(i).get(0);
            String v = equations.get(i).get(1);
            double value = values[i];

            graph.putIfAbsent(u, new ArrayList<>());
            graph.putIfAbsent(v, new ArrayList<>());

            graph.get(u).add(new Node(v, value));
            graph.get(v).add(new Node(u, 1.0 / value));
        }

        double[] results = new double[queries.size()];

        for (int i = 0; i < queries.size(); i++) {
            String u = queries.get(i).get(0);
            String v = queries.get(i).get(1);

            if (!graph.containsKey(u) || !graph.containsKey(v)) {
                results[i] = -1.0;
            } else if (u.equals(v)) {
                results[i] = 1.0;
            } else {
                Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
                results[i] = dfs(graph, u, v, 1.0, visited);
            }
        }

        return results;
    }

    private double dfs(Map<String, List<Node>> graph, String src, String dest, double product, Set<String> visited) {
        if (src.equals(dest)) {
            return product;
        }
        
        visited.add(src);

        for (Node neighbor : graph.get(src)) {
            if (!visited.contains(neighbor.dest)) {
                double result = dfs(graph, neighbor.dest, dest, product * neighbor.value, visited);
                if (result != -1.0) {
                    return result;
                }
            }
        }

        return -1.0;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        EvaluateDivision solver = new EvaluateDivision();

        List<List<String>> equations = Arrays.asList(
            Arrays.asList("a", "b"),
            Arrays.asList("b", "c")
        );
        double[] values = {2.0, 3.0};
        List<List<String>> queries = Arrays.asList(
            Arrays.asList("a", "c"),
            Arrays.asList("b", "a"),
            Arrays.asList("a", "e"),
            Arrays.asList("a", "a"),
            Arrays.asList("x", "x")
        );

        double[] result = solver.calcEquation(equations, values, queries);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(result));  // Output: [6.0, 0.5, -1.0, 1.0, -1.0]
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:
1. **Graph Construction**: O(E), where E is the number of edges or equations.
2. **DFS Traversal**: In the worst case, each query may traverse all nodes, leading to O(V + E) per query. Assuming E = O(V) due to the nature of the equation relationships, the complexity per query is O(V).

Hence, for Q queries, the overall time complexity is **O(Q * (V + E))**.
