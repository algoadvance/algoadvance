[Leetcode 891. Sum of Subsequence Widths](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l891)
## Problem Statement:

Given an array of integers `nums`, consider all non-empty subsequences of `nums`. For any sequence `s`, let the width of `s` be defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements of `s`.

Return the sum of the widths of all subsequences of `nums`. As the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Example:

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,1,3]
Output: 6
Explanation: The subsequences are [1], [2], [3], [1,2], [1,3], [2,3], [1,2,3].
The corresponding widths are 0, 0, 0, 1, 2, 1, 2.
The sum of these widths is 6.
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 20000`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 20000`

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Are the subsequences required to be contiguous?**
   - No, subsequences can be formed from non-contiguous elements.
2. **Do we need to count empty subsequences?**
   - No, only non-empty subsequences should be considered.

## Strategy:

The brute force approach of generating all subsequences and calculating their widths would be computationally expensive given the constraints. Thus, optimization is key.

### Steps to Optimize:
1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps manage the order and simplifies the width calculations.
2. **Leverage Combinatorics**:
   - If `nums` is sorted, a number `nums[i]` can be the minimum of some subsequences and maximum of some other subsequences.
   - Count how many subsequences have `nums[i]` as their minimum and how many have it as their maximum using combinatorics.
3. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   - For a `nums[i]`, it can be the minimum element in `2^i` subsequences.
   - It can be the maximum element in `2^(n-1-i)` subsequences.
   - Therefore, sum the differences gives: 
     \( \text{sum\_widths} += nums[i] * (2^i - 2^{n-1-i}) \)

### Code Implementation:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class SumOfSubsequenceWidths {
    public int sumSubseqWidths(int[] nums) {
        int MOD = 1_000_000_007;
        int n = nums.length;
        
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        
        long[] pow2 = new long[n];
        pow2[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            pow2[i] = pow2[i - 1] * 2 % MOD;
        }
        
        long res = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            res = (res + nums[i] * (pow2[i] - pow2[n - 1 - i])) % MOD;
        }
        
        return (int) res;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:

- **Sorting**: `O(n log n)`
- **Precomputing Powers of 2**: `O(n)`
- **Sum Calculation**: `O(n)`

Overall, the algorithm runs in `O(n log n)`, making it efficient for the given constraints.
