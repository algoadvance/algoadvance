[Leetcode 933. Number of Recent Calls](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l933)
### Problem Statement
933. Number of Recent Calls

You have a `RecentCounter` class which counts the number of recent requests within a certain time frame.

Implement the `RecentCounter` class:
- `RecentCounter()` initializes the counter with no requests.
- `int ping(int t)` adds a new request at time `t`, where `t` represents some time in milliseconds, and returns the number of requests that have happened in the past 3000 milliseconds (including the new request).

It is guaranteed that every call to `ping` uses a strictly larger value of `t` than before.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the time `t` be negative?
   - No, time `t` will always be non-negative.
2. What is the maximum value of `t`?
   - The constraints do not mention a maximum, but since it's related to milliseconds, you can assume it's always increasing and manageable within typical computational limits.
3. Can we assume consecutive calls to `ping` will use increasing values of `t`?
   - Yes, as per the problem statement.

### Strategy
To handle the pings efficiently:
1. Utilize a queue to store the pings.
2. When a new `ping` is received:
   - Enqueue the current `t`.
   - Dequeue all elements from the front of the queue that are outside the [t-3000, t] time window.
   - The size of the queue represents the number of pings in the last 3000 milliseconds.
3. Return the size of the queue.

Let's implement this strategy in Java.

### Code
```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

class RecentCounter {
    private Queue<Integer> queue;

    public RecentCounter() {
        this.queue = new LinkedList<>();
    }

    public int ping(int t) {
        this.queue.offer(t);
        while (this.queue.peek() < t - 3000) {
            this.queue.poll();
        }
        return this.queue.size();
    }
}

// Example usage
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RecentCounter recentCounter = new RecentCounter();
        System.out.println(recentCounter.ping(1));    // returns 1
        System.out.println(recentCounter.ping(100));  // returns 2
        System.out.println(recentCounter.ping(3001)); // returns 3
        System.out.println(recentCounter.ping(3002)); // returns 3
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Each `ping` operation involves adding one element to the queue and potentially removing all elements less than `t-3000`.
- In the worst case, if there are `n` elements in the queue, all of them might be dequeued when a new `ping` arrives, but since each element is added and removed exactly once, the average time complexity per operation is effectively `O(1)`.
- Therefore, the amortized time complexity for the `ping` function is `O(1)`.

This ensures efficient handling of pings within the required time window.
