[Leetcode 1899. Merge Triplets to Form Target Triplet](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1899)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer array `triplets`, where `triplets[i] = [a_i, b_i, c_i]` describes the `i-th` triplet. You are also given an integer array `target = [x, y, z]` that describes the target triplet.

To form the target triplet `[x, y, z]`, you can select any number of triplets and combine them to form the target triplet. During the combination process, you can add the `i-th` triplet if it does not exceed the target triplet, meaning `a_i <= x`, `b_i <= y`, and `c_i <= z`. After selecting the triplets, you can change each element in the target triplet to be the maximum value of the corresponding elements among the selected triplets.

Return `true` if it is possible to form the target triplet `[x, y, z]` as described above, otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Q: Can the input triplets array contain duplicate triplets?
   A: Yes, the input can contain duplicate triplets. Each triplet is considered independently.

2. Q: What is the range of values for elements in `triplets` and `target`?
   A: The elements in `triplets` and `target` will generally be within the range `1 <= a_i, b_i, c_i, x, y, z <= 1000`.

3. Q: Are there any constraints on the length of the triplets array?
   A: The length of the `triplets` array can be up to `10^5`.

### Strategy

1. Initialize three boolean flags `found_a`, `found_b`, and `found_c`, each representing if we have found triplets to satisfy the components `a`, `b`, and `c` respectively in the target triplet.
2. Iterate over each triplet in the `triplets` array:
   * Check if each element of the current triplet does not exceed the corresponding element in the target.
   * Check if any element of the current triplet equals the target element and update the boolean flags accordingly.
3. After the loop, if all three boolean flags are `true`, return `true`, indicating that it is possible to form the target triplet. Otherwise, return `false`.
 
### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean mergeTriplets(int[][] triplets, int[] target) {
        boolean found_a = false, found_b = false, found_c = false;

        for (int[] triplet : triplets) {
            if (triplet[0] <= target[0] && triplet[1] <= target[1] && triplet[2] <= target[2]) {
                if (triplet[0] == target[0]) found_a = true;
                if (triplet[1] == target[1]) found_b = true;
                if (triplet[2] == target[2]) found_c = true;
            }
        }

        return found_a && found_b && found_c;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The main loop iterates through each triplet exactly once, so the time complexity is O(n), where `n` is the number of triplets in the input array.
- **Space Complexity**: The solution uses a fixed number of extra variables, so the space complexity is O(1).
