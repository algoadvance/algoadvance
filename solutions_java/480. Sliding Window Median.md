[Leetcode 480. Sliding Window Median](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l480)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums`, there is a sliding window of size `k` which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the `k` numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position. Your task is to return the median array for each window in the original array.

Example:

```
Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
Output: [1,-1,-1,3,5,6]
```

Explanation:
Window position:  
```
[1 3 -1] -3 5 3 6 7        ->  1
 1 [3 -1 -3] 5 3 6 7       -> -1
 1 3 [-1 -3 5] 3 6 7       -> -1
 1 3 -1 [-3 5 3] 6 7       ->  3
 1 3 -1 -3 [5 3 6] 7       ->  5
 1 3 -1 -3 5 [3 6 7]       ->  6
```

Note:
1. You may assume `k` is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ the length of the input array.
2. The array may contain duplicates, and negative numbers are allowed.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Will the input array `nums` always have more elements than `k`?
   - Yes, as the problem assumes `k` is always valid.
2. Are negative numbers allowed in the input array?
   - Yes.
3. How should the median be handled for both odd and even-sized windows?
   - For an odd-sized window, the median is the middle element after sorting. For an even-sized window, it is the average of the two middle numbers.

## Strategy

To calculate the median of the sliding window efficiently as it moves across the array, maintain a balanced structure that allows us to quickly insert and remove elements. Here's a feasible approach:

1. **Use two heaps:**
   - Max-heap `low` to store the smaller half.
   - Min-heap `high` to store the larger half.
   
2. **Balancing Heaps:**
   - Ensure `low` and `high` heaps are balanced in size or `low` has one extra element when the total number of elements is odd.

3. **Extract Median:**
   - If the number of elements is odd, return the top of the `low` heap.
   - If even, return the average of the tops of the `low` and `high` heaps.

4. **Sliding Window Management:**
   - Add the new element to the appropriate heap.
   - Remove the element that is sliding out of the window.
   - Rebalance the heaps if necessary.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class SlidingWindowMedian {

    public double[] medianSlidingWindow(int[] nums, int k) {
        if (nums == null || k <= 0) return new double[0];
        
        double[] result = new double[nums.length - k + 1];
        PriorityQueue<Integer> low = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        PriorityQueue<Integer> high = new PriorityQueue<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (low.isEmpty() || low.peek() >= nums[i]) {
                low.add(nums[i]);
            } else {
                high.add(nums[i]);
            }

            if (low.size() > high.size() + 1) {
                high.add(low.poll());
            } else if (low.size() < high.size()) {
                low.add(high.poll());
            }

            if (i - k + 1 >= 0) {
                if (low.size() == high.size()) {
                    result[i - k + 1] = ((double) low.peek() + high.peek()) / 2.0;
                } else {
                    result[i - k + 1] = (double) low.peek();
                }

                int toRemove = nums[i - k + 1];
                if (low.contains(toRemove)) {
                    low.remove(toRemove);
                } else {
                    high.remove(toRemove);
                }

                if (low.size() > high.size() + 1) {
                    high.add(low.poll());
                } else if (low.size() < high.size()) {
                    low.add(high.poll());
                }
            }
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SlidingWindowMedian swm = new SlidingWindowMedian();
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(swm.medianSlidingWindow(new int[]{1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7}, 3)));
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- Inserting an element into a heap: `O(log k)`
- Removing an element from a heap: `O(k)` due to the potential need to sift through the heap.
- For each of the `n` elements in the array, we might perform insertion and removal.

Overall: for each element, the operations are `O(k log k)`. Thus, for `n` elements, the complexity ends up being `O(n log k)`.
