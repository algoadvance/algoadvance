[Leetcode 2034. Stock Price Fluctuation ](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2034)
### Problem Statement

You are given a stream of records about a particular stock. Each record contains a stock's timestamp and price. Your task is to implement a class `StockPrice` that has the following methods:

- `StockPrice()`: Initializes the object with no records.
- `void update(int timestamp, int price)`: Updates the price of the stock at the given timestamp.
- `int current()`: Returns the latest price of the stock.
- `int maximum()`: Returns the maximum price of the stock.
- `int minimum()`: Returns the minimum price of the stock.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should I do if the same timestamp is updated with a different price?**
   - You should update the stock price at that timestamp to the new price.
2. **Can timestamps decrease?**
   - Yes, timestamps can appear out of order but each timestamp will be unique.

### Strategy

To efficiently implement these functionalities, we can use the following data structures:

1. **A HashMap (`timestampPriceMap`)**: To store the price corresponding to each timestamp.
2. **Two Heaps**:
    - A *Max-Heap* (`maxHeap`) to keep track of the maximum prices.
    - A *Min-Heap* (`minHeap`) to keep track of the minimum prices.
3. **A Variable (`latestTimestamp`)**: To keep track of the latest timestamp for computing the current price.

We'll need to ensure that heaps are up-to-date only with valid prices, which would require possibly validating and re-polling from the heaps if the top element is outdated.

### Implementation

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class StockPrice {
    private HashMap<Integer, Integer> timestampPriceMap;
    private PriorityQueue<int[]> maxHeap;
    private PriorityQueue<int[]> minHeap;
    private int latestTimestamp;
    private int latestPrice;

    public StockPrice() {
        timestampPriceMap = new HashMap<>();
        maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b[1] - a[1]);
        minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a[1] - b[1]);
    }

    public void update(int timestamp, int price) {
        // Updating the price in the map
        timestampPriceMap.put(timestamp, price);
        
        // If this is the latest update, update latestTimestamp and latestPrice
        if (timestamp >= latestTimestamp) {
            latestTimestamp = timestamp;
            latestPrice = price;
        }

        // Add the new price to the heaps
        maxHeap.add(new int[]{timestamp, price});
        minHeap.add(new int[]{timestamp, price});
    }

    public int current() {
        return latestPrice;
    }

    public int maximum() {
        while (!timestampPriceMap.get(maxHeap.peek()[0]).equals(maxHeap.peek()[1])) {
            maxHeap.poll();
        }
        return maxHeap.peek()[1];
    }

    public int minimum() {
        while (!timestampPriceMap.get(minHeap.peek()[0]).equals(minHeap.peek()[1])) {
            minHeap.poll();
        }
        return minHeap.peek()[1];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **`update(int timestamp, int price)`**: The insertion in the `HashMap` is O(1). The insertion in both heaps is O(log n).
  - Overall: O(log n)
- **`current()`**: O(1) as it simply returns a cached value.
- **`maximum()`**: On average O(log n), because in the worst case, it has to poll out all invalidated entries until a valid one remains.
- **`minimum()`**: Similar to `maximum()`, on average O(log n).

By employing this strategy, the implementation ensures efficient updates and queries even as the size of the input stream grows.
