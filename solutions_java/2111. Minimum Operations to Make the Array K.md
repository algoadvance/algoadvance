[Leetcode 2111. Minimum Operations to Make the Array K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2111)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array `arr` consisting of `n` positive integers, and an integer `k`. You need to ensure that for every `i` (0 <= i <= n - k), `arr[i] <= arr[i + k]`. Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to achieve this. In one operation, you can replace any element with any value.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the array elements and the integer `k`?**
    - Can `k` be greater than the length of the array?
    - Are there any specific limits on the values of the array elements or `n`?

2. **What should be returned if the array is already k-increasing?**

3. **Is the array guaranteed to have positive integers only?**

### Code
```java
import java.util.*;

public class MinimumOperationsKIncreasing {
    
    public int kIncreasing(int[] arr, int k) {
        int n = arr.length, result = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            List<Integer> subList = new ArrayList<>();
            for (int j = i; j < n; j += k) {
                subList.add(arr[j]);
            }
            result += minOperationsToMakeNonDecreasing(subList);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    private int minOperationsToMakeNonDecreasing(List<Integer> subList) {
        List<Integer> lis = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int num : subList) {
            int pos = Collections.binarySearch(lis, num);
            if (pos < 0) {
                pos = -(pos + 1);
            }
            if (pos == lis.size()) {
                lis.add(num);
            } else {
                lis.set(pos, num);
            }
        }
        return subList.size() - lis.size();
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumOperationsKIncreasing solver = new MinimumOperationsKIncreasing();
        int[] arr = {5, 4, 3, 2, 1};
        int k = 1;
        System.out.println(solver.kIncreasing(arr, k)); // Should return 4
    }
}
```

### Strategy
1. **Break Down the Problem into Sub-Problems**: 
    - Divide the array into `k` independent subarrays, where each subarray consists of elements `arr[i], arr[i + k], arr[i + 2k], ...`.

2. **Make Each Subarray Non-Decreasing**:
    - For each subarray, calculate the minimum number of operations required to make it non-decreasing. This can be done efficiently using the concept of Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS). The key observation is that the minimum operations required to make an array non-decreasing is equal to the size of the array minus the length of its LIS.

3. **Sum Up Results**:
    - Sum the results of all such subarrays to get the final result.

### Time Complexity
- **O(n * log n)** where `n` is the length of the array:
    - Constructing subarrays takes linear time in terms of the size of the original array.
    - Finding the length of the LIS using binary search takes `O(m * log m)` for each subarray, where `m` is the size of the subarray. Since the number of subarrays is `k` and their average size is `n/k`, the total complexity combines to `O(n * log(n/k))`, which simplifies to `O(n * log n)` in most cases.

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: We start by initializing a result variable to store the total number of operations required.
- **Subarray Creation**: We then create each subarray by iterating with a step of `k`.
- **LIS Calculation**: For each subarray, we determine the minimum number of operations to make it non-decreasing using the length of the LIS, and adjust the result accordingly.
- **Summing Results**: The results across all subarrays are then summed to produce the final answer.
