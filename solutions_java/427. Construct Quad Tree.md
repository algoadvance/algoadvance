[Leetcode 427. Construct Quad Tree full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l427)
### Problem Statement

Given a `n * n` matrix `grid` of `0`s and `1`s only. We want to represent the `grid` with a Quad-Tree.

Return the root of the Quad-Tree representing the grid.

Notice that you can assign the value of a node to `True` or `False` when `isLeaf` is `True`, and assign the children for a `False` node in the following order:

1. Top left child
2. Top right child
3. Bottom left child
4. Bottom right child

A Quad-Tree is a tree data structure in which each internal node has exactly four children. Besides, each node has two attributes:
- `val`: `True` if the node represents a grid of 1's or `False` if the node represents a grid of 0's.
- `isLeaf`: a boolean value that is `True` if the node is a leaf node and `False` if it is an internal node.

We can construct a Quad-Tree from a two-dimensional area using the following steps:
1. If the current grid has the same value (all `1`s or all `0`s), set `isLeaf` to `True` and set `val` to the value of the grid, and set the four children to `Null`.
2. If the current grid has different values, set `isLeaf` to `False` and set `val` to any value, and divide the current grid into four sub-grids as shown in the problem description.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the range of `n`?
    - Is `n` always a power of 2?
    
    *Assumption*: `n` is always a power of 2, making it easier to recursively divide the grid evenly.

2. **Output**:
    - The output should be a valid Quad-Tree structure representing the grid.

### Strategy

1. **Base Case**:
    - If the entire grid has the same value, create a leaf node.

2. **Recursive Division**:
    - Divide the grid into four quadrants and recursively construct the Quad-Tree for each quadrant.
    - If all four children are leaves and have the same value, merge them into a single leaf node.
    
3. **Node Structure**:
    - Use a class `Node` to store `val`, `isLeaf`, and the four children (`topLeft`, `topRight`, `bottomLeft`, `bottomRight`).

### Code

```java
class Node {
    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;

    public Node() {}

    public Node(boolean val, boolean isLeaf) {
        this.val = val;
        this.isLeaf = isLeaf;
        this.topLeft = null;
        this.topRight = null;
        this.bottomLeft = null;
        this.bottomRight = null;
    }

    public Node(boolean val, boolean isLeaf, Node topLeft, Node topRight, Node bottomLeft, Node bottomRight) {
        this.val = val;
        this.isLeaf = isLeaf;
        this.topLeft = topLeft;
        this.topRight = topRight;
        this.bottomLeft = bottomLeft;
        this.bottomRight = bottomRight;
    }
}

public class Solution {
    public Node construct(int[][] grid) {
        return construct(grid, 0, 0, grid.length);
    }

    private Node construct(int[][] grid, int row, int col, int length) {
        if (isUniform(grid, row, col, length)) {
            return new Node(grid[row][col] == 1, true);
        }
        
        int halfLength = length / 2;
        
        Node topLeft = construct(grid, row, col, halfLength);
        Node topRight = construct(grid, row, col + halfLength, halfLength);
        Node bottomLeft = construct(grid, row + halfLength, col, halfLength);
        Node bottomRight = construct(grid, row + halfLength, col + halfLength, halfLength);

        return new Node(
            false, 
            false, 
            topLeft, 
            topRight, 
            bottomLeft, 
            bottomRight
        );
    }
    
    private boolean isUniform(int[][] grid, int row, int col, int length) {
        int value = grid[row][col];
        for (int i = row; i < row + length; i++) {
            for (int j = col; j < col + length; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] != value) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n^2 log n)` where `n` is the width/height of the `grid`.
    - The `isUniform` check is `O(n^2)` for each level.
    - The recursion depth is `log n`.
    
- **Space Complexity**: `O(log n)` due to the recursion stack.
