[Leetcode 1827. Minimum Operations to Make the Array Increasing](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1827)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` (0-indexed). In one operation, you can choose an element of the array and increment it by 1.

- For example, if `nums = [1,2,3]`, you can choose to increment `nums[1]` to make `nums = [1,3,3]`.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make `nums` strictly increasing.

An array `nums` is strictly increasing if `nums[i] < nums[i+1]` for all `0 <= i < nums.length - 1`. An array of length 1 is trivially strictly increasing.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of values for the elements in `nums`?
   - What is the length range of the array `nums`?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should be returned for an array of length 1?
   - How to deal with already strictly increasing arrays?

### Strategy
To make the array strictly increasing:
1. Traverse through the array from the second element.
2. For each element, check if it's less than or equal to the previous element.
3. If it is, increment it to one more than the previous element.
4. Count the number of increments (operations) performed.

### Code

Here is the Java code to solve this problem:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums) {
        int operations = 0;
        
        // Traverse the array from the second element
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            // If the current element is not greater than the previous one
            if (nums[i] <= nums[i - 1]) {
                // Calculate the increments needed to make nums[i] > nums[i - 1]
                int incrementNeeded = nums[i - 1] - nums[i] + 1;
                // Apply the increments
                nums[i] += incrementNeeded;
                // Add the increments to the operations counter
                operations += incrementNeeded;
            }
        }
        
        return operations;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array `nums`. This is because we are performing a single pass through the array to make the necessary adjustments.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since we are not using any additional space that scales with the input size.

### Example

1. **Input:** `nums = [1, 1, 1]`
   - **Output:** 3
   - **Explanation:**
     - Increment `nums[1]` to 2, `nums` becomes `[1, 2, 1]` (1 operation).
     - Increment `nums[2]` to 3, `nums` becomes `[1, 2, 3]` (2 operations).
     - Total operations = 1 + 2 = 3.
