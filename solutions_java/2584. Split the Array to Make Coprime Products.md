[Leetcode 2584. Split the Array to Make Coprime Products](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2584)
### Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n`. Split the array into two (possibly empty) groups `left` and `right` such that:

- Every element of the array `nums` belongs either to the group `left` or to the group `right`.
- **Both** the greatest common divisor of the members of `left` and the greatest common divisor of the members of `right` are equal to `1`.

Return the number of ways the array can be split.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [2,3,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation:
There are three ways to split nums into two non-empty groups:
- The numbers between indices 0 and 1: [2,3,4] and [5].
- The numbers between indices 1 and 2: [2,3] and [4,5].
- The numbers between indices 2 and 3: [2,3,4] and [5].
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can elements in `nums` be negative or zero?**
   - No, the array `nums` will only contain positive integers.

2. **Can the splitting result in empty subarrays for either group?**
   - No, both subarrays should be non-empty.

3. **How large can the array `nums` be?**
   - The length of `nums` can be up to 1000.

4. **Are there any constraints on the array elements apart from being positive integers?**
   - No, there are no other specific constraints mentioned.

### Strategy

1. **Calculate Right GCDs:**
   - We can first precompute an array where each element `rightGCD[i]` contains the GCD of all elements from `nums[i]` to the end of the list. This helps in quickly calculating the GCD of the right group for any split point.

2. **Iterate and Check for Splits:**
   - Iteratively consider every possible split point and calculate the GCD of the left group using a running GCD variable while using the precomputed `rightGCD` to get the GCD of the right group efficiently.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int countSplits(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;

        if (n == 1) return 0;

        // Create an array to store the GCDs of the right part
        int[] rightGCD = new int[n + 1];
        rightGCD[n] = 0;

        // Compute the rightGCD array
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            rightGCD[i] = gcd(rightGCD[i + 1], nums[i]);
        }

        int leftGCD = 0;
        int count = 0;

        // Iterate and calculate the GCDs for the left part, comparing with the right part GCDs
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            leftGCD = gcd(leftGCD, nums[i]);
            if (leftGCD == 1 && rightGCD[i + 1] == 1) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
    
    private int gcd(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            int temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.countSplits(new int[] {2, 3, 4, 5}));  // Output: 3
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Precomputing `rightGCD` Array:** O(n)
- **Main Iteration for Checking Splits:** O(n)
- **Total Time Complexity:** O(n)

This solution is efficient given the constraints and ensures that we can quickly determine the number of valid splits.
