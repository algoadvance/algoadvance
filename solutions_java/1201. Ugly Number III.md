[Leetcode 1201. Ugly Number III full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1201)
### Problem Statement

An **ugly number** is a positive integer that is divisible by either `a`, `b`, or `c`.

Given four integers `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c`, return the `n`-th ugly number.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the input guaranteed to be within a certain range?**
   - The problem constraints typically determine this. From the context, `1 <= n <= 10^9` and `1 <= a, b, c <= 2 * 10^9` seem reasonable.

2. **Are the integers `a`, `b`, and `c` distinct?**
   - It's generally assumed that `a`, `b`, and `c` are distinct, though the solution can handle cases where they might not be.

3. **What should be returned if there are multiple candidates for the `n`-th ugly number?**
   - The smallest one should be returned (but realistically, for any given `n`, there will be only one correct `n`-th smallest ugly number).

### Strategy

To find the `n`-th ugly number that is divisible by `a`, `b`, or `c`, we can leverage the **binary search** technique to efficiently locate it. Here's the high-level approach:

1. **Binary Search Setup:**
   - Define the search space with `left = 1` and `right` set to a reasonably large value, such as `2 * 10^9`.

2. **Counting Ugly Numbers:**
   - Create a helper function to count how many numbers up to a certain value `x` are divisible by `a`, `b`, or `c`.
   - Use the inclusion-exclusion principle to avoid counting duplicates (e.g., numbers divisible by both `a` and `b`).

3. **Binary Search Execution:**
   - Perform binary search to narrow down on the `n`-th ugly number by checking the count of ugly numbers up to the midpoint of the current search range.

### Code

Here's the Java code for the solution:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int nthUglyNumber(int n, int a, int b, int c) {
        long left = 1, right = 2 * (long) 1e9;
        
        while (left < right) {
            long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (countUglyNumbers(mid, a, b, c) < n) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        
        return (int) left;
    }
    
    private long gcd(long x, long y) {
        if (y == 0) return x;
        return gcd(y, x % y);
    }
    
    private long lcm(long x, long y) {
        return x * (y / gcd(x, y));
    }
    
    private long countUglyNumbers(long x, long a, long b, long c) {
        return x / a + x / b + x / c 
                - x / lcm(a, b) 
                - x / lcm(b, c) 
                - x / lcm(c, a) 
                + x / lcm(a, lcm(b, c));
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - `left` starts at 1 and `right` at `2 * 10^9`, ensuring the search space is large enough.
   - In each iteration, calculate the mid-point `mid`.
   - Use the `countUglyNumbers` to check how many ugly numbers are less than or equal to `mid`.
   - Adjust `left` and `right` based on the result to converge to the exact `n`-th ugly number.

2. **Counting Function (`countUglyNumbers`):**
   - Calculate the number of multiples of `a`, `b`, and `c` up to `x`.
   - Correct for over-counting by subtracting the counts of the least common multiples (lcm) of pairs and adding back the lcm of the triplet.

3. **Auxiliary Functions for GCD and LCM:**
   - `gcd` computes the greatest common divisor.
   - `lcm` computes the least common multiple using the formula `a * (b / gcd(a, b))`.

### Time Complexity

1. **Binary Search:**
   - The binary search runs in `O(log(max value))`, where `max value` is `2 * 10^9`.

2. **Counting Function:**
   - Each call to `countUglyNumbers` involves several divisions and gcd/lcm calculations, which take constant time.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(log(max value)) = O(log(2 * 10^9)) â‰ˆ O(30)`, making it very efficient.
