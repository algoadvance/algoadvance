[Leetcode 283. Move Zeroes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l283)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, move all `0`s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Example:
```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can I modify the input array in place?**
   - Yes, you need to modify the input array in place.
   
2. **Is it acceptable to use extra storage?**
   - Ideally, you should aim for a solution that uses O(1) extra space.
   
3. **What should I do if the array is empty or contains only one element?**
   - If the array is empty or contains only one element, you can return it as is since no modifications are needed.

### Strategy
The main strategy involves two pointers:
1. **`lastNonZeroFoundAt`:** Tracks the position to place the next non-zero element.
2. **`current`:** Loops through all elements in the array.

Algorithm:
1. Iterate through the array with `current`. For every non-zero element `nums[current]`:
   - Swap it with `nums[lastNonZeroFoundAt]`.
   - Increment `lastNonZeroFoundAt`.
2. By the end of the iteration, all non-zero elements are shifted to the front, and `lastNonZeroFoundAt` is positioned at the first zero.

### Code
Here is the Java implementation:

```java
public class Solution {
    public void moveZeroes(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) return;
        
        int lastNonZeroFoundAt = 0;
        
        // Move all the non-zero elements forward
        for (int current = 0; current < nums.length; current++) {
            if (nums[current] != 0) {
                // Swap the elements
                int temp = nums[lastNonZeroFoundAt];
                nums[lastNonZeroFoundAt] = nums[current];
                nums[current] = temp;
                
                lastNonZeroFoundAt++;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the array. The array is traversed once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we only use a few extra variables regardless of the input size.

In conclusion, this two-pointer technique efficiently moves all zeroes to the end while maintaining the order of non-zero elements.
