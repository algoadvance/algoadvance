[Leetcode 2787. Ways to Express an Integer as Sum of Powers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2787)
### Problem Statement

Given two positive integers `n` and `x`, return the number of ways `n` can be expressed as the sum of the `x`th power of unique positive integers. Since the answer can be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the values of `n` and `x`?**
   - The problem typically entails customary algorithm constraints. We should assume `1 <= n <= 1000` and `1 <= x <= 5` unless stated otherwise.

2. **Do we consider permutations as different ways or unique sums only?**
   - We consider unique sums only.

3. **Can numbers be used more than once in the sum?**
   - No, each positive integer can be used only once.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. Here's the detailed plan:

1. **Understand the Problem**:
   - We need to express `n` as a sum of the `x`th powers of unique positive integers.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Let `dp[i]` be the number of ways to write the integer `i` as the sum of `x`th powers of unique numbers.
   - Initialize `dp[0] = 1` (only one way to sum to zero, by choosing no elements).
   - Iterate through numbers from `1` to `n`, and for each number, update the `dp` array backwards to ensure elements are only used once.
   - For each integer `k`, compute `power = k^x`. If `power` is less than or equal to `n`, update the `dp` array.
   - For `i` from `n` to `power`, update `dp[i] += dp[i - power]` to include ways to form `i` using `k^x`.

3. **Result**:
   - The result will be in `dp[n]`.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Use modulo `10^9 + 7` to keep the numbers manageable and avoid overflow.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n * √n), because for each value up to `n`, we are iterating up to √n essentially (due to the power calculations).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the DP array.

### Code

Here's the implementation in Java:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class WaysToExpressSumOfPowers {
    private static final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;

    public int numberOfWays(int n, int x) {
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 1; // base case: one way to sum up to 0

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            int power = (int) Math.pow(i, x);
            if (power > n) break; // no need to continue if power is larger than n

            for (int j = n; j >= power; j--) {
                dp[j] = (dp[j] + dp[j - power]) % MOD;
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
  
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WaysToExpressSumOfPowers solver = new WaysToExpressSumOfPowers();
        System.out.println(solver.numberOfWays(10, 2)); // Example test case
    }
}
```

This solution follows the dynamic programming approach and ensures we efficiently calculate the number of ways to express the integer as a sum of powers with unique positive integers.
