[Leetcode 1365. How Many Numbers Are Smaller Than the Current Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1365)
### Problem Statement
Given the array `nums`, for each `nums[i]` find out how many numbers in the array are smaller than it. That is, for each `nums[i]` you have to count the number of valid `j`'s such that `j != i` and `nums[j] < nums[i]`.

Return the answer in an array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the array contain duplicate numbers?**
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicate numbers.
2. **What is the range of the values in the array?**
   - The values in the array are in the range `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`.
3. **What is the size range of the array?**
   - The size of the array is in the range `2 <= nums.length <= 500`.

### Code
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class SmallerNumbersThanCurrent {
    public int[] smallerNumbersThanCurrent(int[] nums) {
        int[] count = new int[101];
        
        // Count the number of occurrences of each number
        for (int num : nums) {
            count[num]++;
        }
        
        // Modify count array to store the number of elements less than or equal to the current index
        for (int i = 1; i < 101; i++) {
            count[i] += count[i - 1];
        }
        
        // Create result array
        int[] result = new int[nums.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == 0) {
                result[i] = 0;
            } else {
                result[i] = count[nums[i] - 1];
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SmallerNumbersThanCurrent solution = new SmallerNumbersThanCurrent();
        int[] nums = {8, 1, 2, 2, 3};
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(solution.smallerNumbersThanCurrent(nums)));
    }
}
```

### Strategy
1. **Count Frequencies:** 
   - Use an array `count` of size 101 (since `nums[i]` ranges from 0 to 100) to count occurrences of each number in the `nums` array.
2. **Prefix Sum Array:**
   - Convert the `count` array to a prefix sum array where each element at index `i` contains the sum of all counts from `0` to `i`. This helps in easily counting how many numbers are smaller than the current number.
3. **Construct the Result:**
   - For each number in `nums`, use the prefix sum array to find out how many numbers are smaller than the current number. If the current number is `0`, then there are no numbers less than `0`, otherwise, use the value from the prefix sum array.
   
### Time Complexity
- **Counting Frequencies:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the `nums` array.
- **Prefix Sum Calculation:** O(100) = O(1), as the range of numbers is fixed (0 to 100).
- **Constructing Result:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the `nums` array.

So, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.
