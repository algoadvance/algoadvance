[Leetcode 1845. Seat Reservation Manager](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1845)
## Problem Statement

You are tasked with implementing a `SeatManager` class to manage seat reservations in a cinema. The seats are numbered from 1 to n, and initially, all seats are unreserved.

You need to implement the following methods:

1. **`SeatManager(int n)`**: Initializes a `SeatManager` object that manages `n` seats numbered `1 to n`. All seats initially are unreserved.
2. **`int reserve()`**: Fetches the smallest-numbered unreserved seat, reserves it, and returns its number.
3. **`void unreserve(int seatNumber)`**: Unreserves the seat with the given number, making it available again.

### Example:

```java
SeatManager seatManager = new SeatManager(5); 
seatManager.reserve();    // reserves seat 1 and returns 1
seatManager.reserve();    // reserves seat 2 and returns 2
seatManager.unreserve(2); // unreserves seat 2
seatManager.reserve();    // reserves seat 2 and returns 2
seatManager.reserve();    // reserves seat 3 and returns 3
seatManager.reserve();    // reserves seat 4 and returns 4
seatManager.reserve();    // reserves seat 5 and returns 5
seatManager.unreserve(5); // unreserves seat 5
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Are the seat numbers guaranteed to be in the range 1 to n?**
   - **A: Yes, seat numbers are always within this range.**
2. **Q: Can multiple unreserve calls be made consecutively with the same seat number?**
   - **A: No, each seat can be unreserved only if it is currently reserved.**
3. **Q: Is there any scenario where `reserve` is called when all seats are already reserved?**
   - **A: No, it is guaranteed that `reserve` will not be called if no seats are available.**

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a Min-Heap (Priority Queue) to keep track of the smallest available seats.
   - Initially, populate the Priority Queue with the seat numbers from 1 to n.

2. **Reserve**:
   - Poll from the Priority Queue to get the smallest unreserved seat number.

3. **Unreserve**:
   - Add the unreserved seat number back into the Priority Queue.

This ensures that the seat reservation operations are efficient, allowing both `reserve` and `unreserve` to operate in logarithmic time due to the properties of the Priority Queue.

## Code

Here's the Java implementation of the `SeatManager` class:

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class SeatManager {
    private PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap;

    public SeatManager(int n) {
        minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            minHeap.offer(i);
        }
    }

    public int reserve() {
        return minHeap.poll();
    }

    public void unreserve(int seatNumber) {
        minHeap.offer(seatNumber);
    }

    // Additional helper methods, if needed, can be added here
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization (`SeatManager` Constructor)**: O(n)
  - We initialize a Priority Queue and insert `n` elements, each insert operation takes O(log n) time but adding n such elements can be done in O(n).

- **reserve()**: O(log n)
  - Extracting the smallest element from the Priority Queue takes O(log n) time due to the heap property.

- **unreserve(int seatNumber)**: O(log n)
  - Inserting a new element back into the Priority Queue also takes O(log n) time.

This implementation ensures that our seat reservation system is efficient and scalable for large values of `n`.
