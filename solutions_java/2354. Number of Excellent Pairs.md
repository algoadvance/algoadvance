[Leetcode 2354. Number of Excellent Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2354)
### Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed positive integer array `nums` and a positive integer `k`. A pair of numbers `(num1, num2)` is called excellent if the following conditions are satisfied:

1. `num1` and `num2` are elements in the array `nums` (they can be the same element).
2. The sum of the number of set bits in `num1` and the number of set bits in `num2` is greater than or equal to `k`.

Return the number of excellent pairs.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the array elements guaranteed to be positive integers?
   - Yes, the problem states that `nums` is a positive integer array.
2. Can `num1` and `num2` be the same element within the pair?
   - Yes, the problem statement allows the pairs to be the same element.
3. What are the constraints for `nums` and `k`?
   - These might be important for considering the efficiency of the solution, but we'll work on typical constraints that LeetCode problems have.

### Strategy
1. **Understand Set Bits**: The main challenge lies with counting the set bits (binary representation of set bits) for each number.
2. **Preprocessing**: Count the number of set bits for each number in `nums` and store these counts.
3. **Frequency Count**: Use a frequency count to determine how many numbers have a certain number of set bits.
4. **Pair Counting**: Iterate through the frequency array, and for each possible number of set bits, count the possible excellent pairs that the sum of the set bits meet the criterion.

### Code
```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class ExcellentPairs {
    public long countExcellentPairs(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Create a HashSet to get the unique values in nums
        HashSet<Integer> uniqueNums = new HashSet<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            uniqueNums.add(num);
        }
        
        // Count the number of set bits for each unique number
        // and store the frequency of these counts
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> bitCountFreq = new HashMap<>();
        for (int num : uniqueNums) {
            int bitCount = Integer.bitCount(num);
            bitCountFreq.put(bitCount, bitCountFreq.getOrDefault(bitCount, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        // List of unique bit counts for the next step
        List<Integer> bitCounts = new ArrayList<>(bitCountFreq.keySet());
        
        // Count the number of excellent pairs
        long result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < bitCounts.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < bitCounts.size(); j++) {
                if (bitCounts.get(i) + bitCounts.get(j) >= k) {
                    result += (long) bitCountFreq.get(bitCounts.get(i)) * bitCountFreq.get(bitCounts.get(j));
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Strategy Explained
1. **Step 1**: Use a `HashSet` to ensure each number is considered only once, as duplicates would lead to overcounting.
2. **Step 2**: Use `Integer.bitCount()` to compute the number of set bits for each number and store the frequency of these bit counts in a `HashMap`.
3. **Step 3**: Convert the keys of the frequency map to a list for iteration.
4. **Step 4**: For each pair of bit counts (including pairs with the same bit count), check if their sum meets or exceeds `k`. If the condition is met, multiply their frequencies to get the number of pairings possible between these groups of bit counts.
5. **Step 5**: Sum all valid pair counts to get the total number of excellent pairs.

### Time Complexity
- Constructing the `uniqueNums` set and computing bit counts: O(N)
- Filling the frequency map: O(U) where U is the number of unique elements.
- Double nested loop over unique bit counts: O(B^2) where B is the number of different bit counts within the unique elements.

Given typical constraints, this solution should be efficient for appropriately bounded inputs.
