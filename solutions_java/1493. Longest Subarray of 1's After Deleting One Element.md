[Leetcode 1493. Longest Subarray of 1's After Deleting One Element](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1493)
### Problem Statement
Given a binary array `nums`, you should delete one element from it.

Return the size of the longest non-empty subarray containing only 1's in the resulting array. Return 0 if there is no such subarray.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Does the array contain only 0s and 1s?**
   - Yes, the array contains only binary elements (0 and 1).
2. **What is the minimum and maximum length of the array?**
   - The length of the array can range from 1 to 10^5.
3. **What should be returned if the array is composed entirely of 1s?**
   - Since we have to delete one element, the maximum length of the subarray in this case would be one less than the length of the array.
4. **Can we assume the input will always be valid and non-null?**
   - Yes, assume the input is always valid and non-null.

### Strategy
1. **Sliding Window Approach**: We will use a sliding window technique to keep track of the 1's in the array and allow for one 0 to be deleted.
2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: We'll maintain a window with two pointers, `start` and `end`. The `end` pointer expands the window, and the `start` pointer will be adjusted to ensure there is at most one 0 within the window.
3. **Track the Number of 0s**: Use a counter to track the number of 0s in the current window.
4. **Update the Maximum Length**: The length of the window minus one (because one element has to be deleted) will give us the potential result. Keep updating the maximum length observed.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int longestSubarray(int[] nums) {
        int maxLen = 0;
        int start = 0;
        int zeroCount = 0;

        for (int end = 0; end < nums.length; end++) {
            if (nums[end] == 0) {
                zeroCount++;
            }

            // Shrink the window from the left if the zero count exceeds 1
            while (zeroCount > 1) {
                if (nums[start] == 0) {
                    zeroCount--;
                }
                start++;
            }

            // Calculate the current window length excluding one deletion
            int currentLen = end - start;
            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, currentLen);
        }
        
        // If the entire array has only 1s, subtract one from the length as one 1 must be deleted
        if (maxLen == nums.length) {
            maxLen--;
        }
        
        return maxLen;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The sliding window approach ensures that each element is processed at most twice (once by the `end` pointer and at most once by the `start` pointer), giving us a linear time complexity, O(n).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we use only a few extra variables and do not require additional space proportional to the input size.

This approach efficiently finds the longest subarray of 1s that we can obtain after deleting exactly one element, ensuring optimal performance for large arrays.
