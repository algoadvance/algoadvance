[Leetcode 1801. Number of Orders in the Backlog](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1801)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer array `orders`, where each `orders[i] = [price_i, amount_i, orderType_i]` denotes that `price_i` is the price of `amount_i` units of some product and `orderType_i` is either:
- `0` for a `buy` order, or
- `1` for a `sell` order.

There is a backlog that consists of `unexecuted` orders. The backlog is initially empty. When orders arrive, you may execute some of them using the following rules:

- If the current order is a `buy` order, check the existing `sell` orders in the backlog. If there is a lowest-price `sell` order such that `price_i <= price_{current_buy}`, match that order with the current `buy` order, reducing the amount of units in both orders by as much as possible. If some units of the `buy` order remain, add those units to the backlog.
  
- If the current order is a `sell` order, check the existing `buy` orders in the backlog. If there is a highest-price `buy` order such that `price_i >= price_{current_sell}`, match that order with the current `sell` order, reducing the amount of units in both orders by as much as possible. If some units of the `sell` order remain, add those units to the backlog.

Return the total amount of units in the backlog after executing all the orders. Since the number can be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can multiple orders come with the same price?
   **A**: Yes, multiple orders can have the same price.

2. **Q**: What should be done if a buy or sell order matches multiple existing orders?
   **A**: The most suitable matching orders should be executed sequentially in the order they appear.

3. **Q**: Is it required to keep the orders sorted?
   **A**: Yes, to efficiently execute orders the buy orders should be managed in a max-heap and the sell orders in a min-heap.

### Strategy

1. Use a max-heap for `buy` orders to always get the highest-priced `buy` order.
2. Use a min-heap for `sell` orders to always get the lowest-priced `sell` order.
3. Iterate over each incoming order:
   - If it's a `buy` order, attempt to match it with the lowest-priced `sell` orders.
   - If it's a `sell` order, attempt to match it with the highest-priced `buy` orders.
4. Add remainder orders that couldn't be executed to the respective heap.
5. Calculate the total units left in both heaps after processing all orders.

### Code

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class Solution {
    public int getNumberOfBacklogOrders(int[][] orders) {
        final int MOD = 1000000007;

        // PriorityQueue for buy orders (max-heap)
        PriorityQueue<int[]> buyOrders = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> Integer.compare(b[0], a[0]));
        // PriorityQueue for sell orders (min-heap)
        PriorityQueue<int[]> sellOrders = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));

        for (int[] order : orders) {
            int price = order[0];
            int amount = order[1];
            int orderType = order[2];

            if (orderType == 0) { // Buy order
                while (amount > 0 && !sellOrders.isEmpty() && sellOrders.peek()[0] <= price) {
                    int[] sellOrder = sellOrders.poll();
                    if (sellOrder[1] > amount) {
                        sellOrder[1] -= amount;
                        sellOrders.offer(sellOrder);
                        amount = 0;
                    } else {
                        amount -= sellOrder[1];
                    }
                }
                if (amount > 0) {
                    buyOrders.offer(new int[]{price, amount});
                }
            } else { // Sell order
                while (amount > 0 && !buyOrders.isEmpty() && buyOrders.peek()[0] >= price) {
                    int[] buyOrder = buyOrders.poll();
                    if (buyOrder[1] > amount) {
                        buyOrder[1] -= amount;
                        buyOrders.offer(buyOrder);
                        amount = 0;
                    } else {
                        amount -= buyOrder[1];
                    }
                }
                if (amount > 0) {
                    sellOrders.offer(new int[]{price, amount});
                }
            }
        }

        long backlogOrders = 0;
        while (!buyOrders.isEmpty()) {
            backlogOrders += buyOrders.poll()[1];
        }
        while (!sellOrders.isEmpty()) {
            backlogOrders += sellOrders.poll()[1];
        }

        return (int) (backlogOrders % MOD);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Heap Operations**: Each insert and extraction operation (matching orders) on the heap takes \(O(\log N)\) where \(N\) is the number of orders in the heap.
- **Iterating Orders**: We iterate through all given orders, so this takes \(O(M)\) where \(M\) is the number of orders.

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(M \log N)\). 

The space complexity is \(O(N)\) to store the orders in the heaps.
