[Leetcode 16. 3Sum Closest](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l16)
### Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` of `n` integers and an integer `target`, find three integers in `nums` such that the sum is closest to `target`. Return the sum of the three integers. You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [-1, 2, 1, -4], target = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: The sum that is closest to the target is 2. (-1 + 2 + 1 = 2).
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the array contain duplicate integers?
   **A:** Yes, the array can contain duplicates.

2. **Q:** Should the solution handle large arrays efficiently?
   **A:** Yes, the solution should be efficient enough to handle reasonably large arrays as per typical LeetCode constraints.

3. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the values of integers in `nums`, such as minimum or maximum values?
   **A:** No specific constraints aside from standard integer limits.

### Strategy
1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting the array will help in efficiently finding the closest sum using a two-pointer approach.
2. **Traverse the Array**: Use a for loop to iterate through each element.
3. **Two-Pointer Technique**: For each selected element, use two pointers (`left` and `right`) to find the pair that, along with the selected element, gives the closest sum to the target.
   - Initialize `left` to the element next to the current element and `right` to the last element.
   - Calculate the current sum of the triplet.
   - If the current sum is closer to the target than the previous closest sum, update the closest sum.
   - Move the pointers based on whether the current sum is less than or greater than the target to try and get closer to the target.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class ThreeSumClosest {
    public int threeSumClosest(int[] nums, int target) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int closestSum = nums[0] + nums[1] + nums[2];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++) {
            int left = i + 1;
            int right = nums.length - 1;
            
            while (left < right) {
                int currentSum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right];
                
                if (Math.abs(currentSum - target) < Math.abs(closestSum - target)) {
                    closestSum = currentSum;
                }
                
                if (currentSum < target) {
                    left++;
                } else if (currentSum > target) {
                    right--;
                } else {
                    // if the currentSum is exactly equal to the target, it's the closest possible sum
                    return currentSum;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return closestSum;
    }

    // For Testing
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ThreeSumClosest solver = new ThreeSumClosest();
        int[] nums = {-1, 2, 1, -4};
        int target = 1;
        int result = solver.threeSumClosest(nums, target);
        System.out.println(result); // Output should be 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Sorting the array takes `O(n log n)`.
- The traversal of the array with the two-pointer technique inside the for loop takes `O(n^2)` in the worst case.
  - For each element, the two-pointer approach runs a linear scan.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is `O(n^2)`.

### Summary
- Sort the array.
- Use a for loop to iterate through the array and a two-pointer approach to find the closest triplet sum.
- Continuously update the closest sum when a closer sum is found.
- The time complexity is `O(n^2)`, which is efficient for the given problem.
