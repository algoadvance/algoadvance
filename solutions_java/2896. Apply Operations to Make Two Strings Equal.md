[Leetcode 2896. Apply Operations to Make Two Strings Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2896)
## Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `t`, you want to transform string `s` into string `t` using a series of operations. The allowed operations are:

1. Choose any character in `s` and add it to the front of the string.
2. Choose any character in `s` and move it to the end of the string.

Return `true` if it's possible to transform `s` into `t`, otherwise return `false`.

### Example

#### Example 1
```
Input: s = "AB", t = "BA"
Output: true
```

#### Example 2
```
Input: s = "AAB", t = "ABA"
Output: true
```

#### Example 3
```
Input: s = "AAB", t = "ABB"
Output: false
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the strings composed of only uppercase and lowercase English letters?
2. Are the lengths of the two strings always the same?
3. How should we handle cases where the given strings are empty?
4. Can an operation be performed on an empty string?

## Strategy

To determine if we can make `s` equal to `t` using the given operations, observe that these operations do not change the sequence of characters; they only move characters within the string. Hence, the problem can be simplified to checking if both strings contain exactly the same characters with the same frequencies.

### Steps:
1. Check if the lengths of `s` and `t` are the same. If not, return `false`.
2. Count the frequency of each character in both `s` and `t`.
3. Compare the frequency maps of both strings. If they match, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity for this solution will be linear, O(n), where n is the length of the strings. This is because we need to count the frequency of characters in both strings and then compare the frequency maps.

## Code
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class TransformString {
    
    public static boolean canTransform(String s, String t) {
        if (s.length() != t.length()) {
            return false;
        }

        Map<Character, Integer> freqS = new HashMap<>();
        Map<Character, Integer> freqT = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            freqS.put(c, freqS.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }

        for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
            freqT.put(c, freqT.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }

        return freqS.equals(freqT);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(canTransform("AB", "BA")); // true
        System.out.println(canTransform("AAB", "ABA")); // true
        System.out.println(canTransform("AAB", "ABB")); // false
    }
}
```

This approach ensures that we can determine if the transformation is possible while adhering to the constraints and the allowable operations. If the character frequencies match, it implies that the transformation is achievable using the provided operations.
