[Leetcode 1478. Allocate Mailboxes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1478)
### Problem Statement:

Given a list of houses and a list of mailboxes, your task is to allocate mailboxes in such a way that the total travel distance is minimum. Total travel distance is the sum of the distances between the houses and their nearest mailbox. You have to determine the optimal way to allocate the m mailboxes among the n houses.

#### Example:
```
Input: houses = [1,4,8,10,20], m = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: Allocate mailboxes at 3 positions [1, 8, 20]. Minimum total distance is 5. 
```

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q: Are there any constraints on the number of houses and mailboxes?**
   - A: Yes, typically 1 <= houses.length <= 100 and 1 <= m <= houses.length.
   
2. **Q: Are the houses sorted in the input array?**
   - A: The problem does not guarantee a sorted list, but sorting the houses initially can help in simplifying the logic.

3. **Q: How do you measure the distance?**
   - A: Distance is measured as the absolute difference between the position of a house and a mailbox, i.e., `|house[i] - mailbox[j]|`.

### Strategy:

To solve this problem optimally, we will use Dynamic Programming (DP) to keep track of the minimal total travel distance. Here's the approach in steps:

1. **Sort the houses**: Sorting helps us in defining intervals and reduces complexity when calculating distances.
   
2. **Precompute costs for placing a single mailbox**:
   - Compute the cost for placing one mailbox between any range of houses. This helps in reducing recalculations during the main DP step.
   
3. **DP state definition**:
   - `dp[i][k]` where `i` is the first `i` houses and `k` is the number of mailboxes. This state represents the minimal total travel distance for the first `i` houses with `k` mailboxes.
   
4. **Transitional relation**:
   - For each house `i`, decide the optimal split point `j` to place a mailbox such that total distance is minimized while placing within `k` mailboxes.

### Code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class AllocateMailboxes {
    
    public int minDistance(int[] houses, int m) {
        Arrays.sort(houses);
        int n = houses.length;
        int[][] cost = new int[n][n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                int median = houses[(i + j) / 2];
                for (int k = i; k <= j; k++) {
                    cost[i][j] += Math.abs(houses[k] - median);
                }
            }
        }
        
        int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i <= m; i++) {
            Arrays.fill(dp[i], Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2); // to avoid overflow
        }
        dp[0][0] = 0;
        
        for (int k = 1; k <= m; k++) {
            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                    dp[k][i] = Math.min(dp[k][i], dp[k-1][j] + cost[j][i-1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[m][n];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AllocateMailboxes solution = new AllocateMailboxes();
        int[] houses = {1, 4, 8, 10, 20};
        int m = 3;
        System.out.println(solution.minDistance(houses, m)); // Output: 5
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

1. **Sorting the houses**: O(n log n).
2. **Precomputing costs**: O(n^3), for each pair `(i, j)` and iterating over all houses between them.
3. **Dynamic Programming**: O(m * n^2), since we iterate over all splits and all mailboxes.

Although the approach involves a cubic time complexity in the precomputation stage, it's feasible within the given constraints (n <= 100). Combining sorting and DP, the overall complexity is O(n log n + n^3 + m * n^2) which simplifies to O(n^3).
