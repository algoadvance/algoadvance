[Leetcode 1674. Minimum Moves to Make Array Complementary](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1674)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` of even length `n` and an integer limit. In one move, you can replace any element in `nums` with another integer between `1` and `limit`, inclusive.

The array `nums` is complementary if for all indices `i` (0-indexed) from `0` to `n/2 - 1`, `nums[i] + nums[n-1-i]` is the same.

Return the minimum number of moves required to make `nums` complementary.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can `nums` contain negative numbers or zeros?
   - **A:** No, `nums` contains positive integers between `1` and `limit`, inclusive.
   
2. **Q:** What is the range of `limit` and the length of `nums`?
   - **A:** `1 <= limit <= 10^5` and `2 <= n <= 10^5` where `n` is even.

3. **Q:** Is it guaranteed that there is at least one solution possible using the given `limit`?
   - **A:** Yes, with appropriate moves, a solution is always possible.

### Strategy
To make the problem easier, we can break down the problem into three main scenarios for transforming pairs `(nums[i], nums[n-1-i]`:

1. **No moves needed:** If the sum of pairs is already the target sum.
2. **One move needed:** If we can change one of the numbers in the pair to achieve the target sum.
3. **Two moves needed:** If both numbers in the pair need to be changed to achieve the target sum.

To efficiently compute the minimum moves required:
1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Use a prefix sum array to keep track of the number of changes required.
2. **Ranges Update**: For each `i`, update ranges based on `nums[i] + nums[n-1-i]` which keeps track of minimum sums and the adjustments needed.

### Code
Here is the Java implementation:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minMoves(int[] nums, int limit) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] diff = new int[2 * limit + 2];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
            int a = nums[i];
            int b = nums[n - 1 - i];
            
            // Decrease moves by 2 for range [2, a + b]: two moves become zero if sum already fits
            diff[2] -= 2;  
            // Decrease moves by 1 for range [Math.min(a, b) + 1, Math.max(a, b) + limit]
            diff[Math.min(a, b) + 1] -= 1;
            // Range [a + b, a + b] means zero changes needed
            diff[a + b] += 1;
            // Increase moves by 1 for range [a + b + 1, Math.max(a, b) + limit]
            diff[a + b + 1] += 1;
            // Increase by 2 for range [Math.max(a, b) + limit + 1, 2*limit]
            diff[Math.max(a, b) + limit + 1] += 2;
        }
        
        int minMoves = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int moves = 0;
        for (int i = 2; i <= 2 * limit; i++) {
            moves += diff[i];
            minMoves = Math.min(minMoves, moves);
        }
        
        return minMoves;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization and Preprocessing:** O(n)
  - Loop through pairs of the array once.
- **Finding Minimum Moves:** O(limit)
  - Iterate through possible sums to find the result.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n + limit), which is efficient given the constraints.
