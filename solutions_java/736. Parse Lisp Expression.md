[Leetcode 736. Parse Lisp Expression](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l736)
### Problem Statement

The problem describes an interpreter for a simple Lisp language as follows:

1. An expression can be an integer, which is evaluated to itself.
2. Expressions can be one of three kinds of Lisp expressions:
   - Let expression: `(let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr)`
   - Add expression: `(add e1 e2)`
   - Mult expression: `(mult e1 e2)`

The definitions for these expressions are:
- `(let v1 e1 v2 e2 ... vn en expr)` assigns the value of `e1` to `v1`, value of `e2` to `v2`, ..., value of `en` to `vn`, then evaluates `expr` in the context of these assignments.
- `(add e1 e2)` evaluates to the sum of the values of `e1` and `e2`.
- `(mult e1 e2)` evaluates to the product of the values of `e1` and `e2`.

You are to evaluate the given Lisp expression and return the result.

### Clarifying Questions

Before diving into the solution, it's a good idea to clarify a few things:
1. What are the valid ranges for the integers in the expressions?
2. Can the variables in the `let` expression be nested?
3. Are there any constraints on the length of the expressions?

Assuming:
- Integers are within the range of standard 32-bit signed integers.
- Variables can be nested, and scope should be managed correctly.
- The length of the expressions and their nestedness would be reasonable to handle programmatically in allowed time and memory limits.

### Strategy

We'll employ a parsing strategy that:
1. Recursively evaluates sub-expressions.
2. Manages scopes using a stack of hashmaps to keep track of variable contexts.

Here's the breakdown of the key components in the solution:
- A function to recursively evaluate an expression.
- Use stacks and hashmaps for handling variable scopes.
- Handling different kinds of expressions (`let`, `add`, and `mult`).

### Code


```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int evaluate(String expression) {
        return evaluate(expression, new HashMap<>());
    }

    private int evaluate(String expression, Map<String, Integer> currentScope) {
        if (expression.charAt(0) != '(') {
            // If it is an integer
            if (Character.isDigit(expression.charAt(0)) || expression.charAt(0) == '-') {
                return Integer.parseInt(expression);
            }
            // If it is a variable
            return currentScope.get(expression);
        }

        // Remove outermost parentheses
        String strippedExpr = expression.substring(1, expression.length() - 1);
        String[] tokens = tokenize(strippedExpr);
        String command = tokens[0];

        if (command.equals("add")) {
            return evaluate(tokens[1], currentScope) + evaluate(tokens[2], currentScope);
        } else if (command.equals("mult")) {
            return evaluate(tokens[1], currentScope) * evaluate(tokens[2], currentScope);
        } else { // "let" clause
            Map<String, Integer> newScope = new HashMap<>(currentScope);
            for (int i = 1; i < tokens.length - 1; i += 2) {
                String variable = tokens[i];
                int value = evaluate(tokens[i + 1], newScope);
                newScope.put(variable, value);
            }
            return evaluate(tokens[tokens.length - 1], newScope);
        }
    }

    private String[] tokenize(String expression) {
        List<String> tokens = new ArrayList<>();
        int balance = 0;
        StringBuilder token = new StringBuilder();

        for (char c : expression.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '(') balance++;
            if (c == ')') balance--;

            if (c == ' ' && balance == 0) {
                tokens.add(token.toString());
                token = new StringBuilder();
            } else {
                token.append(c);
            }
        }
        tokens.add(token.toString()); // add last token
        return tokens.toArray(new String[0]);
    }
}

```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is somewhat challenging to nail down due to the potential for highly nested expressions. But in general:
- Parsing each expression to handle different operations is linear in terms of its length.
- Recursion into sub-expressions depends on the depth of the expression.

Considering worst-case nested expressions:
- Let expression depth would be O(n) where n is the number of nested let statements.
- Total time complexity will be O(n) for parsing and evaluating expressions sequentially within reasonable depth and complexity constraints.

This should cover most typical problem constraints effectively, with proper handling of variable scoping using nested hashmaps.
