[Leetcode 2614. Prime In Diagonal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2614)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer array `nums`. You are to return the largest prime number that lies on any of the diagonals in the `nums` array. If there are no prime numbers present in the diagonals, return 0.

A prime number is an integer greater than 1 that has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

Your solution should consider both the primary and the secondary diagonals:
- The primary diagonal of a 2D array element `nums[i][j]` is where `i == j`.
- The secondary diagonal of a 2D array element `nums[i][j]` is where `i + j == len(nums) - 1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can the 2D array have negative numbers or zeroes?
   **A**: The array may contain any integers including negative numbers and zeroes. However, for the purpose of this problem, we only consider positive integers greater than 1 as potential prime candidates.

2. **Q**: What are the constraints on the size of the 2D array?
   **A**: Typically, these constraints will be mentioned explicitly within the problem. For now, let's assume the size is reasonable for typical interview questions, say up to 100x100 elements.

3. **Q**: Should the solution address edge cases, such as very small arrays or arrays without any primes?
   **A**: Yes, the implementation should handle edge cases appropriately and return 0 if no prime numbers are found.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class PrimeInDiagonals {
    
    public static int largestPrimeInDiagonals(int[][] nums) {
        Set<Integer> diagonalElements = new HashSet<>();
        
        int n = nums.length;
        
        // Collecting primary diagonal elements
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            diagonalElements.add(nums[i][i]);
        }
        
        // Collecting secondary diagonal elements
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            diagonalElements.add(nums[i][n - 1 - i]);
        }
        
        int largestPrime = 0;
        for (int num : diagonalElements) {
            if (isPrime(num)) {
                largestPrime = Math.max(largestPrime, num);
            }
        }
        
        return largestPrime;
    }
    
    private static boolean isPrime(int num) {
        if (num <= 1) {
            return false;
        }
        if (num <= 3) {
            return true;
        }
        if (num % 2 == 0 || num % 3 == 0) {
            return false;
        }
        for (int i = 5; i * i <= num; i += 6) {
            if (num % i == 0 || num % (i + 2) == 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    // Main method for quick testing
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] nums1 = {
            {2, 3, 5},
            {7, 11, 13},
            {17, 19, 23}
        };
        System.out.println(largestPrimeInDiagonals(nums1)); // should output 23
        
        int[][] nums2 = {
            {2, 3},
            {5, 7}
        };
        System.out.println(largestPrimeInDiagonals(nums2)); // should output 7
        
        int[][] nums3 = {
            {4, 6},
            {8, 9}
        };
        System.out.println(largestPrimeInDiagonals(nums3)); // should output 0
    }
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Extract Diagonal Elements**: Traverse the primary and secondary diagonals to collect all the elements in these diagonals.
2. **Check for Primes**: For each collected element, verify if the number is prime.
3. **Find the Largest Prime**: Track the largest prime found during the prime-checking phase.

## Time Complexity

- **Prime Checking**: The `isPrime` function operates in \(O(\sqrt{n})\) for a single number.
- **Extraction and Prime Checking**: Extracting elements from the diagonals requires \(O(n)\) time for a single diagonal. For two diagonals, this results in \(O(2n)\) which simplifies to \(O(n)\).
- **Total Complexity**: The total time complexity is \(O(n \sqrt{m})\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the diagonals (which is linear to the array size) and \(\sqrt{m}\) is the complexity for checking prime numbers for each element. \(m\) is the maximum value in the array.
