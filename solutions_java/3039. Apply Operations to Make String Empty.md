[Leetcode 3039. Apply Operations to Make String Empty](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3039)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting only of lowercase English letters. In one operation, you can do the following:

- Select any *group of the same character* and remove it from the string, if the length of this group is at most `k`.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make the string empty.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "aaabbbcccddd", k = 3
Output: 4
Explanation: Remove "aaa" (length 3), "bbb" (length 3), "ccc" (length 3), "ddd" (length 3). It takes 4 operations.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "aaaa", k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: Remove "aaa" (length 3) and "a" (length 1) in two operations.
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 1000`
- `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.
- `1 <= k <= 100`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we assume the input string `s` is non-empty?**
   - Yes, based on the constraint `1 <= s.length`.

2. **Do we need to consider any special characters or uppercase letters?**
   - No, the string consists of only lowercase English letters.

3. **Is the operation case-sensitive?**
   - No, the string consists only of lowercase English letters, thus case-sensitivity is not an issue.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we will:

1. **Iterate through the string** and keep track of consecutive characters.
2. **Count the length of each group of consecutive characters**.
3. For each group:
   - Determine how many operations are needed to remove it by dividing by `k` and rounding up.
4. Sum up the operations needed for all groups.

### Detailed Steps:
1. Initialize variables to count consecutive groups and track the current character and its count.
2. Traverse the string to identify groups of consecutive characters.
3. For each group, calculate how many operations are needed (`ceil(length of group / k)`).
4. Sum up the number of operations and return the result.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minOperations(String s, int k) {
        // Handle the case when string is empty, though constraints guarantee non-empty string
        if (s == null || s.length() == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int count = 0; // To keep count of operations
        int i = 0; // Pointer to traverse the string
        
        while (i < s.length()) {
            char currentChar = s.charAt(i);
            int length = 0; // To count the length of group of same characters
            
            // Count the length of the current group of the same character
            while (i < s.length() && s.charAt(i) == currentChar) {
                length++;
                i++;
            }
            
            // Calculate the number of operations for this group
            count += (length + k - 1) / k; // Equivalent to Math.ceil(length / k)
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}

// Example usage
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        String s = "aaabbbcccddd";
        int k = 3;
        int result = solution.minOperations(s, k);
        System.out.println(result); // Output: 4
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because we traverse the string once, counting lengths of groups and calculating operations needed for each group. No additional nested loops or recursive calls increase the complexity beyond linear time.

The space complexity is **O(1)**, since we are using a fixed number of extra variables regardless of the input size.
