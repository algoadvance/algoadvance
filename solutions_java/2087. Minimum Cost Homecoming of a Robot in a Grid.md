[Leetcode 2087. Minimum Cost Homecoming of a Robot in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2087)
## Problem Statement
You are given an `m x n` grid where you start at the position `(startRow, startCol)` and you are required to move to the position `(homeRow, homeCol)`. The cost of moving one step to the left or right is given in the array `rowCosts` and the cost of moving one step up or down is given in the array `colCosts`. 

- `rowCosts[i]` is the cost of moving one step from row `i` to row `i+1` or from row `i` to row `i-1`.
- `colCosts[j]` is the cost of moving one step from column `j` to column `j+1` or from column `j` to column `j-1`.

Return the minimum cost to move the robot to the home position `(homeRow, homeCol)`.

**Example:**

```
Input:
   startPos = [1, 0], homePos = [2, 3]
   rowCosts = [5, 4, 3]
   colCosts = [8, 2, 6, 7]
Output:
   18
Explanation:
   Start at (1, 0)
   Move to (2, 0) with cost 3 (rowCosts[2])
   Move to (2, 1) with cost 2 (colCosts[1])
   Move to (2, 2) with cost 6 (colCosts[2])
   Move to (2, 3) with cost 7 (colCosts[3])
   Total cost = 3 + 2 + 6 + 7 = 18
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are the costs always non-negative integers?
2. Will the start and home positions always be valid within the grid dimensions?
3. Do we need to account for wrap-around movement in the grid?
4. Should the robot avoid any obstacles that might exist in the grid?

For this problem, we will assume:
- Yes, the costs are non-negative.
- Yes, the start and home positions are valid.
- No wrap-around movement.
- No obstacles in the grid.

## Strategy
We need to determine the path from `(startRow, startCol)` to `(homeRow, homeCol)` with minimal cost. A straightforward approach is to:
- Calculate horizontal movements to align the columns and sum the corresponding costs.
- Calculate vertical movements to align the rows and sum the corresponding costs.

Steps:
1. Move vertically to align the rows.
2. Move horizontally to align the columns.

We will sum the row and column costs for each move.

## Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int minCost(int[] startPos, int[] homePos, int[] rowCosts, int[] colCosts) {
        int startRow = startPos[0], startCol = startPos[1];
        int homeRow = homePos[0], homeCol = homePos[1];
        
        int totalCost = 0;
        
        // Move vertically
        if (startRow < homeRow) {
            for (int i = startRow + 1; i <= homeRow; i++) {
                totalCost += rowCosts[i];
            }
        } else {
            for (int i = startRow - 1; i >= homeRow; i--) {
                totalCost += rowCosts[i];
            }
        }
        
        // Move horizontally
        if (startCol < homeCol) {
            for (int i = startCol + 1; i <= homeCol; i++) {
                totalCost += colCosts[i];
            }
        } else {
            for (int i = startCol - 1; i >= homeCol; i--) {
                totalCost += colCosts[i];
            }
        }
        
        return totalCost;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is \(O(m + n)\) where \(m\) is the number of rows between the start and home positions, and \(n\) is the number of columns between the start and home positions. This is efficient for the given problem constraints.
