[Leetcode 3181. Maximum Total Reward Using Operations II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3181)
### Problem Statement

You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays `reward1` and `reward2` (each of size `n`) representing the rewards for `n` employees. You can choose certain employees at the cost of performing certain operations, and your goal is to maximize the total reward using these operations.

The two arrays represent two different types of rewards for each employee. Specifically:
- You can increase the total reward by selecting an employee and either taking `reward1[i]` or `reward2[i]`.

Each employee can only be picked once.

You are also given an integer `similarities` representing a similarity condition; you need to ensure that the selected employees contribute to the similarities condition, which adds an extra layer of complexity to the selection strategy.

Given these conditions, your task is to find the maximum total reward.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the definition of similarities condition?** 
   - Does it require a specific number of employees to be included?
   - Is there a specific rule that needs to be followed for the similarity condition?

2. **Is the order of selection important?**
   - Does it matter in which order we select the employees, or is it purely a mathematical optimization problem?

3. **What are the constraints on the input?**
   - What is the range of values for `n` (the number of employees)?
   - What is the range of values for `reward1[i]` and `reward2[i]`?

4. **Can some employees contribute to both rewards?**
   - Or do we have to make a distinct choice whether to pick `reward1[i]` or `reward2[i]` for each employee?

5. **Are negative reward values allowed?**

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Formulate a strategic selection of employees to maximize rewards while considering the similarities condition.
2. Evaluate the decision to pick `reward1[i]` vs `reward2[i]` based on the maximum potential total reward.
3. Apply a greedy or dynamic programming approach to optimize the selection process.

We could consider:
1. Calculating the potential benefit difference between choosing each `reward1[i]` and `reward2[i]`.
2. Utilizing a max-heap or sorting mechanism to prioritize choices that provide the greatest increase in the total reward.

Once we have the answers to the clarifying questions, we can refine this strategy further.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity will depend on the chosen strategy:
1. **Sorting-based approach:** If we sort the potential benefits, the time complexity will be \(O(n \log n)\).
2. **Greedy approach:** If we simply iterate and make decisions, the complexity could be reduced to \(O(n)\).

Given the constraints, we will decide on the best approach.

### Let's assume answers to some clarifying questions

1. We'll assume that selecting any combination of `reward1[i]` or `reward2[i]` will suffice the similarity condition.
2. Negative reward values are allowed and we need to ensure our solution handles such cases properly.

### Code Implementation

Here's the Java code for the problem, assuming our strategy:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MaximumTotalReward {
    
    public static int maxTotalReward(int[] reward1, int[] reward2) {
        int n = reward1.length;
        int totalReward = 0;

        // A differences array and original indices
        Integer[] indices = new Integer[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            indices[i] = i;
        }

        // Sort indices based on the difference between reward1 and reward2
        Arrays.sort(indices, (a, b) -> (reward1[b] - reward2[b]) - (reward1[a] - reward2[a]));

        // Pick the bigger reward from either reward1 or reward2
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int idx = indices[i];
            totalReward += Math.max(reward1[idx], reward2[idx]);
        }

        return totalReward;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] reward1 = {1, 2, 3};
        int[] reward2 = {3, 2, 1};
        System.out.println(maxTotalReward(reward1, reward2)); // Output: 6
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting:** \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Selection process:** \(O(n)\)
So, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

### Explanation:

1. We create an array of indices and sort them based on the difference between `reward1` and `reward2`.
2. By sorting the employees based on potential maximum reward, we ensure that we pick the optimal reward for each employee.
3. Finally, iterate through the sorted list and accumulate the maximum rewards.
