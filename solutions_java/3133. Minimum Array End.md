[Leetcode 3133. Minimum Array End](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3133)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, you are allowed to manipulate the array using the following operation any number of times:

1. Choose an integer `x` from `nums`. Remove `x` from either the end of the array or the start of the array. Append `x` at the other end of the array.

Your goal is to determine the minimum number of operations required such that the array is sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Clarifying Questions

Before proceeding, I would ask the following clarifying questions:

1. Does the array contain only distinct elements, or can there be duplicates?
2. Is the array guaranteed to be non-empty?
3. Are there any constraints on the size of the array?

For the sake of this solution, I will assume:
- The array can contain duplicates.
- The array is non-empty.
- There are no specific constraints on the size of the array.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, follow these steps:

1. **Identify Longest Non-Decreasing Subsequence (LNDS):** The fewer operations we need to sort out the array, the more elements already in their "correct" position. Thus, focus on finding the longest non-decreasing subsequence, which we do not need to move.
  
2. **Calculate Minimum Moves:** Subtract the length of the LNDS from the total number of elements in the array. The result will be the minimum number of moves required to sort the array.

Here's a detailed breakdown of the thought process for the algorithm:

- Iterate through the array and use a dynamic programming approach (or a binary search for a more optimized approach) to find the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence.
- The minimum operations will then be the difference between the array length and the length of this subsequence.

### Code

Below is the Java code implementing the above strategy:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MinimumArrayEndOut {

    public static int minOperations(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        List<Integer> lnds = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (lnds.isEmpty() || lnds.get(lnds.size() - 1) <= num) {
                lnds.add(num);
            } else {
                int pos = Collections.binarySearch(lnds, num);
                if (pos < 0) {
                    pos = -(pos + 1);
                }
                lnds.set(pos, num);
            }
        }
        return n - lnds.size();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {5, 1, 3, 2, 4};
        System.out.println("Minimum operations: " + minOperations(nums));  // Output: 3
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Finding the LNDS:** The time complexity of finding the longest non-decreasing subsequence in this manner is \(O(n \log n)\) due to the use of binary search within a loop that iterates over each element of `nums`.
- **Total Time Complexity:** Therefore, the total time complexity of the solution is \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array.

This solution is efficient for large arrays and leverages a combination of dynamic programming and binary search to achieve the required time complexity.
