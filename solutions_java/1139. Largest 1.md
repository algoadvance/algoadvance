[Leetcode 1139. Largest 1](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1139)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D `grid` of `0`s and `1`s. The aim is to find the largest square containing only `1`s that is bordered by `1`s, meaning the cells on the boundary of the square are all `1`s. Return the area of the largest such square.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What are the dimensions of the grid? (`n x m` where `n` and `m` are between 1 and 300)
   - Is it guaranteed that the grid elements are only `0`s and `1`s?

2. **Output Specification**:
   - If no such square exists, should the function return `0`?

Let's get a confirmation before moving ahead.

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use dynamic programming. We'll need to keep track of the count of consecutive `1`s ending at each cell in both horizontal and vertical directions. This will help us determine the potential size of the square ending at each cell.

### Steps:

1. **Create Auxiliary Matrices**: 
   - `left[i][j]`: Number of continuous `1`s to the left of the cell `(i, j)` including itself.
   - `top[i][j]`: Number of continuous `1`s up to the top of the cell `(i, j)` including itself.

2. **Iterate Over the Grid to Fill Auxiliaries**:
   - Traverse the grid, updating `left` and `top` matrices.

3. **Find the Largest 1-Bordered Square**:
   - Start from the bottom-right and move towards the top-left cell.
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, assume it's the bottom-right corner of the square.
   - Determine the maximum possible size for the square ending at `(i, j)` using the values in `left` and `top`.
   - Check if the other two sides of the square have enough continuous `1`s.

4. **Compute the Area of the Largest Square**.

### Time Complexity:
- Filling `left` and `top` matrices: `O(n * m)`
- Checking for the maximum possible square ending at each cell: `O(n * m)`
- Overall Time Complexity: `O(n * m)`

## Code

```java
public class Largest1BorderedSquare {
    public int largest1BorderedSquare(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        int m = grid[0].length;
        
        int[][] left = new int[n][m];
        int[][] top = new int[n][m];
        
        // Fill the auxiliary matrices
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    left[i][j] = (j > 0 ? left[i][j - 1] : 0) + 1;
                    top[i][j] = (i > 0 ? top[i - 1][j] : 0) + 1;
                }
            }
        }
        
        int maxSize = 0;
        
        // Check from bottom-right towards top-left for potential largest square
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = m - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    // Consider the possible side of the square
                    int possibleSize = Math.min(left[i][j], top[i][j]);
                    while (possibleSize > maxSize) {
                        if (left[i - possibleSize + 1][j] >= possibleSize && top[i][j - possibleSize + 1] >= possibleSize) {
                            maxSize = possibleSize;
                        }
                        possibleSize--;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return maxSize * maxSize;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Largest1BorderedSquare solution = new Largest1BorderedSquare();
        int[][] grid = { 
            {1, 1, 1}, 
            {1, 0, 1}, 
            {1, 1, 1} 
        };
        System.out.println(solution.largest1BorderedSquare(grid)); // Output: 9
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Code:

- We first fill out the auxiliary matrices for storing continuous `1`s left and up from each cell.
- Then, for each cell, consider it as the bottom-right corner of the largest possible square.
- Check if it's possible to form a square of decreasing sizes until we find the maximum possible valid square.
- Finally, return the area of the largest square found.

### Time Complexity Analysis:
- The algorithm runs in `O(n * m)` both for setting up the auxiliary matrices and for checking each cell.
- This ensures it is efficient for the given constraints.
