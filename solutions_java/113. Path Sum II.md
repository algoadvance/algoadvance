[Leetcode 113. Path Sum II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l113)
## Problem Statement

Given a binary tree and a sum, find all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals the given sum.

A leaf is a node with no children.

**Example:**

Given the below binary tree and sum = 22,

```
      5
     / \
    4   8
   /   / \
  11  13  4
 /  \    / \
7    2  5   1
```

Return:

```
[
   [5,4,11,2],
   [5,8,4,5]
]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values in the tree?**
   - The tree node values can be positive or negative integers.
  
2. **What is the range of the sum target?**
   - The target can also be a positive or negative integer.

3. **Can the tree contain duplicate values?**
   - Yes, the tree can have duplicate values.
  
4. **What is the size of the tree?**
   - The size can vary but is generally assumed to fit within memory constraints.

## Strategy

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS) Approach:**
   - Traverse the tree using DFS to explore all paths starting from the root.
   - Maintain a current path list and a running sum of the current path.
   - When we reach a leaf node, check if the running sum equals the target sum and add the path to the result list if it does.
   - Use backtracking to ensure that after exploring one path, the state is reverted to explore other paths.
   
## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> pathSum(TreeNode root, int sum) {
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Integer> currentPath = new ArrayList<>();
        findPaths(root, sum, currentPath, result);
        return result;
    }
    
    private void findPaths(TreeNode node, int sum, List<Integer> currentPath, List<List<Integer>> result) {
        if (node == null) {
            return;
        }
        
        currentPath.add(node.val);
        if (node.left == null && node.right == null && sum == node.val) {
            result.add(new ArrayList<>(currentPath));
        } else {
            findPaths(node.left, sum - node.val, currentPath, result);
            findPaths(node.right, sum - node.val, currentPath, result);
        }
        currentPath.remove(currentPath.size() - 1);
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage:
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(5);
        root.left = new TreeNode(4);
        root.right = new TreeNode(8);
        root.left.left = new TreeNode(11);
        root.left.left.left = new TreeNode(7);
        root.left.left.right = new TreeNode(2);
        root.right.left = new TreeNode(13);
        root.right.right = new TreeNode(4);
        root.right.right.left = new TreeNode(5);
        root.right.right.right = new TreeNode(1);

        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.pathSum(root, 22));
    }
}

class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Traversal Time:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we are visiting each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:**
  - O(N) for the recursion stack in the worst case (if the tree is completely unbalanced, e.g., a linked list).
  - O(N) for the `currentPath` list in the worst case when we store paths.

Hence, the overall space complexity could be O(2N), but we generally express it as O(N).
