[Leetcode 1252. Cells with Odd Values in a Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1252)
## Problem Statement

You're given `m` and `n`, the dimensions of a matrix, and an array `indices` where `indices[i] = [ri, ci]` represents that the `i`-th increment operation is applied on the matrix. Specifically, all cells in row `ri` and all cells in column `ci` are incremented by 1.

Return the number of cells with odd values in the matrix after performing all the given increment operations.

**Example:**

```java
Input: m = 2, n = 3, indices = [[0,1],[1,1]]
Output: 6
Explanation: Initial matrix = [[0,0,0],[0,0,0]].
After applying first increment it becomes [[1,2,1],[0,1,0]].
After applying second increment it becomes [[1,3,1],[1,3,1]].
So, there are 6 cells with odd values.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `m` and `n` be zero?**
    - Typically matrix dimensions will be >= 1. But if zero dimensions are considered, no cells would be present.
2. **Are `ri` and `ci` guaranteed to be within bounds?**
    - Yes, `ri` is between 0 and `m-1` and `ci` is between 0 and `n-1`.

## Strategy
1. **Initialize the Matrix:**
    - Start with an `m x n` matrix initialized with zeros.
2. **Increment Rows and Columns:**
    - For each pair `[ri, ci]` in `indices`, increment every element in row `ri` and column `ci` by 1.
3. **Count Odd Values:**
    - Traverse the matrix to count how many cells contain odd values.

Here's a more optimized strategy to avoid directly manipulating the matrix:

1. **Track Row and Column Increments:**
    - Use two arrays `rowCount` and `colCount` to keep track of the increments for the rows and columns, respectively.
2. **Apply Increments:**
    - For each `[ri, ci]` in `indices`, increment the respective `rowCount[ri]` and `colCount[ci]`.
3. **Calculate Odd Cells:**
    - Traverse through all cells using the row and column increment counts to determine if they end up odd.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int oddCells(int m, int n, int[][] indices) {
        int[] rowCount = new int[m];
        int[] colCount = new int[n];
        
        // Increment counts based on the indices operations
        for (int[] index : indices) {
            int row = index[0];
            int col = index[1];
            rowCount[row]++;
            colCount[col]++;
        }
        
        // Calculate the number of odd cells
        int oddCellsCount = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if ((rowCount[i] + colCount[j]) % 2 != 0) {
                    oddCellsCount++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return oddCellsCount;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Increment Operations:** `O(k)` where `k` is the number of indices (length of the `indices` array).
- **Calculating Odd Cells:** `O(m * n)` where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.

Thus, overall time complexity is `O(m * n + k)`.

This solution efficiently tracks the increments and avoids the direct manipulation of every matrix cell, ensuring a concise and effective implementation.
