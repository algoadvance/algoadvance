[Leetcode 1281. Subtract the Product and Sum of Digits of an Integer](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1281)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n`. Return the difference between the product of its digits and the sum of its digits.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints**:
   - What is the range of the integer `n`?
     - The problem usually specifies that `n` is a positive integer, typically constrained by the input limits of the platform.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - What should be returned if `n` has only one digit?
     - If `n` has only one digit, the product and the sum of that digit will be the same, and their difference will be zero.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Initialize `product` to `1` and `sum` to `0`.

2. **Process Each Digit**:
   - While `n` is greater than `0`:
     - Extract the last digit using `n % 10`.
     - Update the `product` by multiplying it by the extracted digit.
     - Update the `sum` by adding the extracted digit.
     - Remove the last digit from `n` using integer division `n = n / 10`.

3. **Calculate Result**:
   - Return the difference between `product` and `sum`.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int subtractProductAndSum(int n) {
        int product = 1;
        int sum = 0;
        
        while (n > 0) {
            int digit = n % 10;
            product *= digit;
            sum += digit;
            n /= 10;
        }
        
        return product - sum;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is **O(d)**, where `d` is the number of digits in the integer `n`. This is because each digit is processed exactly once.

### Example

Let's walk through an example for better understanding:

1. **Input**: `n = 234`
   - Digits: 2, 3, 4
   - Product: \(2 \times 3 \times 4 = 24\)
   - Sum: \(2 + 3 + 4 = 9\)
   - Result: \(24 - 9 = 15\)

The function returns `15` as expected.
