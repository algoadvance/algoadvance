[Leetcode 2262. Total Appeal of A String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2262)
### Problem Statement

The problem "2262. Total Appeal of A String" ("Total Appeal of A String") asks for the sum of the appeal of all substrings of a given string `s`. The "appeal" is defined as the number of unique characters in the substring.

For example:
- For the string `"abc"`, the substrings and their appeals are:
  - Substrings: `"a"`, `"b"`, `"c"`, `"ab"`, `"bc"`, `"abc"`
  - Appeals: 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3
  - Total Appeal: 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 3 = 10

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the characters in the string limited to lowercase English letters?
2. What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
3. Will the input string be empty or contain only whitespace?

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we need to avoid calculating the appeal for each substring individually due to the quadratic number of substrings. Instead, we'll use dynamic programming and a hash table to track the last occurrence of each character.

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `lastSeen`: A hash map to store the last index where each character was seen.
   - `totalAppeal`: An integer to accumulate the total appeal.
   - `currentAppeal`: An integer to store the appeal of all substrings ending at the current position.

2. **Iterate Through the String**:
   - For each character in the string, calculate the number of new substrings ending with this character.
   - Update the `currentAppeal` for new substrings by adding the difference between the current index and the last seen index of the character.
   - Accumulate the `currentAppeal` into `totalAppeal`.

This strategy ensures that we process each character in linear time, making the solution efficient.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class TotalAppealOfString {
    public static long appealSum(String s) {
        // HashMap to track the last seen indexes of characters
        Map<Character, Integer> lastSeen = new HashMap<>();
        long totalAppeal = 0;
        long currentAppeal = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            
            // Update currentAppeal based on the position of the last occurrence of "c"
            currentAppeal += i - lastSeen.getOrDefault(c, -1);
            
            // Accumulate to total appeal
            totalAppeal += currentAppeal;
            
            // Update the last seen index of the character
            lastSeen.put(c, i);
        }

        return totalAppeal;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "abc";
        System.out.println(appealSum(s)); // Output: 10
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because we iterate over the string once, and each operation within the loop is O(1).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) in terms of auxiliary space, excluding the input data. The `lastSeen` map may use up to O(26) space in the case of lowercase English letters, so effectively it's O(1) given that it's constant and small.

This solution provides a balance between clarity, conciseness, and efficiency, making it suitable for a coding interview scenario.
