[Leetcode 2257. Count Unguarded Cells in the Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2257)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` grid, where each cell is either a guard ('G'), a wall ('W'), or an empty cell ('.'). Guards can see every cell in their row and column that is not obstructed by a wall. You need to determine the number of cells that are not guarded or obstructed by a wall.

### Example

```
Input:
m = 4, n = 4
grid = [["G", ".", ".", "W"], 
        [".", ".", "W", "."], 
        [".", ".", ".", "."], 
        ["W", ".", "G", "."]]

Output:
10
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the dimensions of the grid always positive?**
   - Yes, there will always be m >= 1 and n >= 1.
   
2. **Can guards and walls appear in any configuration?**
   - Yes, guards ('G') and walls ('W') can be placed in any cell of the grid.
   
3. **Do guards only see unobstructed cells in the same row and column?**
   - Yes, the visibility of guards is blocked by walls.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int countUnguarded(int m, int n, char[][] grid) {
        boolean[][] guarded = new boolean[m][n];

        // Mark all cells that are guarded
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            int j = 0;
            while (j < n) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 'G') {
                    guarded[i][j] = true;
                    // Left
                    for (int k = j - 1; k >= 0 && grid[i][k] != 'W'; k--) {
                        guarded[i][k] = guardOrWall(grid[i][k]);
                    }
                    // Right
                    for (int k = j + 1; k < n && grid[i][k] != 'W'; k++) {
                        guarded[i][k] = guardOrWall(grid[i][k]);
                    }
                }
                j++;
            }
        }

        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            int i = 0;
            while (i < m) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 'G') {
                    guarded[i][j] = true;
                    // Up
                    for (int k = i - 1; k >= 0 && grid[i][k] != 'W'; k--) {
                        guarded[k][j] = guardOrWall(grid[k][j]);
                    }
                    // Down
                    for (int k = i + 1; k < m && grid[i][k] != 'W'; k++) {
                        guarded[k][j] = guardOrWall(grid[k][j]);
                    }
                }
                i++;
            }
        }

        // Count unguarded cells
        int unguardedCount = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (!guarded[i][j] && grid[i][j] == '.') {
                    unguardedCount++;
                }
            }
        }

        return unguardedCount;
    }

    private boolean guardOrWall(char c) {
        return c == 'G' || c == 'W';
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialize the `guarded` array:** Create a boolean array to mark cells as guarded.

2. **Mark Guarded Cells in Rows:** Traverse through each row. When a guard is found, mark cells to the left and right as guarded until a wall is encountered.

3. **Mark Guarded Cells in Columns:** Traverse through each column. When a guard is found, mark cells upwards and downwards as guarded until a wall is encountered.

4. **Count Unguarded Cells:** Traverse the grid to count cells that are neither guarded nor walls.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(m*n)` because we traverse the `m x n` grid multiple times (one for rows and one for columns).
- **Space Complexity:** `O(m*n)` due to the additional `guarded` boolean array.
