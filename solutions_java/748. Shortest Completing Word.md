[Leetcode 748. Shortest Completing Word](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l748)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `licensePlate` and an array of strings `words`. The `licensePlate` string consists of alphanumeric characters and spaces. The spaces and numbers in `licensePlate` are irrelevant, and only the letters are relevant. Find the shortest completing word in `words`. A completing word is one that contains all the letters in the `licensePlate` (case insensitive). If there are multiple shortest completing words, return the first one that appears in the array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the completing words case-sensitive?** No, completing words must consider letters case-insensitively.
2. **Are there any constraints on the length of `licensePlate` and `words`?** Typically constraints will be provided, but for this problem, consider reasonable limits (e.g., up to 1000 words, each up to 1000 characters).
3. **How to handle non-alphabetic characters in `licensePlate`?** Ignore non-alphabetic characters.

### Strategy
1. **Extract Relevant Letters:** Extract and count letters from `licensePlate` ignoring spaces and numbers. Convert all letters to lowercase.
2. **Count Letters in Each Word:** For each word in `words`, create a count of its letters.
3. **Check Completing Words:** Check each word to see if it contains all the required letters in the required frequency. Track the shortest word that meets this criterion.
4. **Efficiency:** Use counts in hash maps to compare letter frequencies efficiently.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public String shortestCompletingWord(String licensePlate, String[] words) {
        // Extract the character count from the license plate
        int[] licenseCount = getCharCount(licensePlate.toLowerCase());
        
        String shortest = null;
        
        for (String word : words) {
            if (matches(licenseCount, getCharCount(word.toLowerCase()))) {
                if (shortest == null || word.length() < shortest.length()) {
                    shortest = word;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return shortest;
    }
    
    private int[] getCharCount(String str) {
        int[] count = new int[26];
        for (char c : str.toCharArray()) {
            if (Character.isLetter(c)) {
                count[c - 'a']++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    private boolean matches(int[] licenseCount, int[] wordCount) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (licenseCount[i] > wordCount[i]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **getCharCount Method:** This method takes a string, counts the frequency of each letter, and stores it in an integer array where the index represents the letter ('a' corresponds to index 0, 'b' to index 1, etc.).
2. **matches Method:** This method compares the character count arrays of the license plate and the current word to determine if the word contains at least as many of each letter as the license plate.
3. **Main Method:** The main method iterates over each word and uses the helper methods to find and return the shortest completing word.

### Time Complexity
- **getCharCount:** O(n) where `n` is the length of the string.
- **matches:** O(1), since it always processes a fixed number of 26 letters.
- **Overall Complexity:** Let `m` be the number of words and `l` be the average length of the words. The overall complexity is O(m * l) since we process each word individually.
