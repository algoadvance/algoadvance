[Leetcode 2585. Number of Ways to Earn Points](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2585)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer `target` and an array of `types` where `types[i] = [count_i, mark_i]` represents that there are `count_i` points of `mark_i`, return the number of ways to earn exactly `target` points. Each type can be used zero or more times but cannot exceed its `count_i` value.

### Example
- Input: `target = 3`, `types = [[2, 1], [1, 2]]`
- Output: `3`
    - Explanation: The three ways to earn 3 points are:
        - 3 points using only mark_i = 1 (1+1+1)
        - 2 points using mark_i = 1 and 1 point using mark_i = 2 (1+2)
        - 1 point using mark_i = 1 and 2 points using mark_i = 2 (2+1)

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the points types have negative point values?**
   - No, points types are always non-negative integers.

2. **Can the `target` value be zero?**
   - Yes, in the case where `target = 0`, the only way to achieve zero points is to not use any types.

3. **Are the number counts of types strictly positive?**
   - No, they can be zero which means that type cannot be used.

## Strategy

This problem is a variation of the "Knapsack Problem" which can be solved using dynamic programming.

We'll use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to earn exactly `i` points.

### Steps
1. Initialize a DP array of size `target + 1` where `dp[0] = 1` (one way to achieve 0 points).
2. Loop through each point type.
3. For each type, update the DP array from back to front to avoid overcounting scenarios.

### Initial Code

```java
public class NumberOfWaysToEarnPoints {
    public int waysToReachTarget(int target, int[][] types) {
        int[] dp = new int[target + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;

        for (int[] type : types) {
            int count = type[0];
            int mark = type[1];
            for (int j = target; j >= 0; j--) {
                for (int k = 1; k <= count; k++) {
                    if (j >= k * mark) {
                        dp[j] += dp[j - k * mark];
                    } else {
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[target];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NumberOfWaysToEarnPoints solution = new NumberOfWaysToEarnPoints();
        int target = 3;
        int[][] types = { {2, 1}, {1, 2} };
        System.out.println(solution.waysToReachTarget(target, types));
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Dynamic Programming Array Update**: `O(target * types.length * max(count_i))`
- **Overall Complexity**: The complexity should be manageable for reasonable input sizes based on typical constraints on competitive programming platforms. Each type's count is processed for every possible total up to the target only once.
