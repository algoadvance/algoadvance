[Leetcode 1487. Making File Names Unique](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1487)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of strings `names` of size `n`, where `names[i]` is the name of the `i-th` file, your task is to return an array of strings `ans` of size `n` where `ans[i]` is the actual name the system will assign to the `i-th` file and it satisfies the following rules:
1. If the name `names[i]` does not exist in the array `ans`, then `names[i]` is directly added to `ans`.
2. If the name `names[i]` exists in the array `ans`, append `(k)` to the name of the file where `k` is the smallest positive integer such that the new name does not exist in `ans`. Keep adding this new name until a unique name is found.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: names = ["pes", "fifa", "gta", "pes(2019)"]
Output: ["pes", "fifa", "gta", "pes(2019)"]

Input: names = ["gta", "gta(1)", "gta", "avalon"]
Output: ["gta", "gta(1)", "gta(2)", "avalon"]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Is the array of names always non-empty? 
    - Yes.
2. Are the names case-sensitive?
    - Yes, they are case-sensitive.
3. Can there be multiple files with the same name but different indexes in the output?
    - No, each name in the output must be unique.

### Strategy
1. Use a HashMap `nameCount` to keep track of the counts of each base name without the incrementing number.
2. For each name in the input array:
   - If the name is not in `nameCount`, add it to the map with a counter initialized at 0 and add to the result list.
   - If the name is in `nameCount`, increment the counter until a unique name is found, append this name to the result list, and update the counter in the map.

### Time Complexity
- Time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input list, since we are using a map to keep track of unique names and only performing constant-time operations for each name.

### Code
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class UniqueFileNames {
    public String[] getFolderNames(String[] names) {
        Map<String, Integer> nameCount = new HashMap<>();
        String[] result = new String[names.length];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
            String name = names[i];
            
            if (!nameCount.containsKey(name)) {
                nameCount.put(name, 0);
                result[i] = name;
            } else {
                int k = nameCount.get(name) + 1;
                String newName = name + "(" + k + ")";
                
                while (nameCount.containsKey(newName)) {
                    k++;
                    newName = name + "(" + k + ")";
                }
                
                result[i] = newName;
                nameCount.put(name, k);
                nameCount.put(newName, 0);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```
This code ensures each file name is unique by checking for existing names in a hashmap and incrementally finding a unique suffix.
