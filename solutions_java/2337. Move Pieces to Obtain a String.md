[Leetcode 2337. Move Pieces to Obtain a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2337)
### Problem Statement

You are given two strings `start` and `target` of equal length consisting of the characters 'L', 'R', and '_' only.

`start` represents the initial state of some pieces and `target` represents the desired state:

- 'L' denotes a piece that can move to the left.
- 'R' denotes a piece that can move to the right.
- '_' denotes an empty space.

To transform the string `start` into `target`, you can perform the following operations any number of times:

- Move any 'L' piece to the left if it is not blocked by another piece.
- Move any 'R' piece to the right if it is not blocked by another piece.

Return `true` if it is possible to transform `start` into `target`, and `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are there constraints on the length of the strings?
   - **A:** Yes, the strings `start` and `target` have the same length, up to 10^5 characters.
2. **Q:** Are the characters 'L', 'R', and '_' the only valid inputs?
   - **A:** Yes, these are the only valid characters in the strings.
3. **Q:** Can 'L' pieces move to the right or 'R' pieces move to the left?
   - **A:** No, 'L' pieces can only move to the left and 'R' pieces can only move to the right.

### Strategy

1. **Filter and Compare**: First, remove all the '_' characters from both `start` and `target` and check if the configurations of 'L' and 'R' are the same in the same order. If they are different, return `false`.

2. **Check Valid Movements**: Iterate over characters in `start` and `target`, and ensure:
   - An 'L' in `start` at index `i` can only move to the left to position `j` in `target` if `j <= i`. 
   - An 'R' in `start` at index `i` can only move to the right to position `j` in `target` if `j >= i`. 

By validating these conditions, we ensure all pieces in `start` can be rearranged to form `target`.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the `start` (and `target`) strings. This is because we are processing each character at most twice.

### Code

```java
public class MovePieces {

    public boolean canChange(String start, String target) {
        // Remove '_' from both strings to compare configurations
        String filteredStart = start.replace("_", "");
        String filteredTarget = target.replace("_", "");

        // If configurations of 'L' and 'R' don't match, return false
        if (!filteredStart.equals(filteredTarget)) {
            return false;
        }

        int len = start.length();
        int sIndex = 0, tIndex = 0;

        // Validate the movement constraints
        while (sIndex < len && tIndex < len) {
            // Skipping '_' in both strings
            while (sIndex < len && start.charAt(sIndex) == '_') sIndex++;
            while (tIndex < len && target.charAt(tIndex) == '_') tIndex++;

            // If both indices are within the bounds, check the constraints
            if (sIndex < len && tIndex < len) {
                // Char comparison
                char sChar = start.charAt(sIndex);
                char tChar = target.charAt(tIndex);

                // Invalid if the pieces don't have the same positions from filtered check
                if (sChar != tChar) {
                    return false;
                }

                // Check movement restrictions
                if ((sChar == 'L' && sIndex < tIndex) || (sChar == 'R' && sIndex > tIndex)) {
                    return false;
                }
                
                // Move both pointers past the current 'L' or 'R'
                sIndex++;
                tIndex++;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MovePieces solution = new MovePieces();
        System.out.println(solution.canChange("_L__R__R_", "L______RR")); // true
        System.out.println(solution.canChange("R_L_", "__LR")); // false
    }
}
```

This implementation ensures that we can determine if `start` can be transformed into `target` by validating both the order of pieces and their ability to move according to the rules.
