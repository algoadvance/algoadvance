[Leetcode 2059. Minimum Operations to Convert Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2059)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` and two integers: `start` and `goal`. You can perform the following operations on the integer `x` any number of times:

1. x + nums[i]
2. x - nums[i]
3. x ^ nums[i] (bitwise XOR)

Your task is to return the minimum number of operations required to convert `start` into `goal`. If this is not possible, return -1.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [2, 4, 12], start = 2, goal = 12
Output: 2
Explanation:
We can convert 2 -> 4 -> 12 with the following operations:
2 + 2 = 4
4 * 2 = 12
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are there any constraints on the values within the `nums` array?
2. Is there a maximum number of operations we should consider to prevent infinite loops?

### Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: This is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph. Each transformation can be seen as a move from one node to another in a graph.

2. **visited array**: To track numbers we have already transformed to, preventing re-processing.

3. **Edge cases**: Check if `start` is already equal to `goal`.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MinOperationsToConvert {
    public int minimumOperations(int[] nums, int start, int goal) {
        if (start == goal) {
            return 0;
        }

        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        Set<Integer> visited = new HashSet<>();
        queue.add(new int[]{start, 0});
        visited.add(start);

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] current = queue.poll();
            int value = current[0];
            int steps = current[1];

            for (int num : nums) {
                int[] nextValues = new int[]{
                        value + num,
                        value - num,
                        value ^ num
                };

                for (int nextValue : nextValues) {
                    if (nextValue == goal) {
                        return steps + 1;
                    }
                    if (nextValue >= 0 && nextValue <= 1000 && !visited.contains(nextValue)) {
                        visited.add(nextValue);
                        queue.add(new int[]{nextValue, steps + 1});
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinOperationsToConvert solver = new MinOperationsToConvert();
        int[] nums = {2, 4, 12};
        System.out.println(solver.minimumOperations(nums, 2, 12)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N * B), where N is the size of the `nums` array and B is the bound (up to 1000) we are considering for intermediate results.
- **Space Complexity**: O(B), for storing states in the `visited` set and the queue.

### Explanation

1. Use a `Queue` for BFS, initialized with the starting point and 0 steps.
2. Use a `Set` to keep track of visited numbers within the range [0, 1000] to avoid cycles.
3. For each number, try all possible operations, check if the result matches the `goal`, and ensure we only process valid numbers (0 to 1000) that have not been visited yet.
4. If we reach the `goal`, return the number of steps taken.
5. If the queue is empty and we haven't found the `goal`, return -1 indicating it's not possible.
