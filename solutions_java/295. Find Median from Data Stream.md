[Leetcode 295. Find Median from Data Stream](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l295)
## Problem Statement

The problem is to design a data structure that supports adding numbers from a data stream and finding the median of all the numbers that have been added. Implement the `MedianFinder` class:

- `MedianFinder()` initializes the `MedianFinder` object.
- `void addNum(int num)` adds the integer `num` from the data stream to the data structure.
- `double findMedian()` returns the median of all elements so far. Answers within `10^-5` of the actual answer will be accepted.

The median is the middle value in a sorted list of integers. If the list has an odd number of elements, the median is the middle one. If the list has an even number of elements, the median is the average of the two middle ones.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the range or values of the integers that will be added?**
   - Typically, they are assumed to fit within standard integer ranges.

2. **Can the data stream be very large?**
   - Yes, the data structure should efficiently handle large amounts of data and operations in logarithmic time.

3. **Do we need to handle any special cases like integer overflow?**
   - No, standard integer operations will suffice unless otherwise indicated.

4. **Are the add and find operations expected to be called frequently and potentially in any order?**
   - Yes, the data structure should handle frequent and interleaved calls to both `addNum` and `findMedian`.

## Strategy

To efficiently handle the addition of numbers and finding the median, we can use two heaps:
- A max-heap (left half) for the lower half of the numbers.
- A min-heap (right half) for the upper half of the numbers.

### Approach:
1. **Max-Heap `maxHeap`**: This heap contains the smaller half of the numbers. The root of this heap is the largest number in this half.
2. **Min-Heap `minHeap`**: This heap contains the larger half of the numbers. The root of this heap is the smallest number in this half.

### Operations:
- **addNum(int num)**:
  - Add the number to the max-heap.
  - Balance the heaps:
    - If the max-heap size exceeds the min-heap by more than one, move the root of the max-heap to the min-heap.
    - If the min-heap has fewer elements, move the root of the min-heap to the max-heap.
  - Ensure the largest number in the max-heap is less than or equal to the smallest number in the min-heap.
  
- **findMedian()**:
  - If both heaps are of equal size, the median is the average of the roots of both heaps.
  - If the heaps are of unequal size, the median is the root of the larger heap.

## Code

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class MedianFinder {
    private PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap;
    private PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap;

    public MedianFinder() {
        maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b - a); // Max-heap
        minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(); // Min-heap
    }

    public void addNum(int num) {
        maxHeap.offer(num);
        minHeap.offer(maxHeap.poll());

        if (maxHeap.size() < minHeap.size()) {
            maxHeap.offer(minHeap.poll());
        }
    }

    public double findMedian() {
        if (maxHeap.size() == minHeap.size()) {
            return (maxHeap.peek() + minHeap.peek()) / 2.0;
        } else {
            return maxHeap.peek();
        }
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **addNum(int num)**: Each addition operation takes \(O(\log n)\) time due to the heap operations (insertion and balancing).
- **findMedian()**: Finding the median takes \(O(1)\) time since it only involves peeking at the roots of the heaps.

Using these two heaps ensures we efficiently handle the conditions needed to find the median in a dynamic data stream scenario.
