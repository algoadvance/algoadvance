[Leetcode 1665. Minimum Initial Energy to Finish Tasks full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1665)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `tasks` where `tasks[i] = [actuali, minimumi]`:

- `actuali` is the actual amount of energy you spend to finish the `i-th` task.
- `minimumi` is the minimum amount of energy you need before starting to the `i-th` task.

Return the minimum initial amount of energy you need to finish all the tasks.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Order of Tasks**:
   - Do the tasks need to be completed in the given order?
   - **Answer**: No, tasks can be completed in any order.
   
2. **Constraints**:
   - What are the constraints on the length of the array and the values of `actual` and `minimum`?
   - **Answer**: The tasks array can have up to \(10^5\) elements, and the values for `actual` and `minimum` are integer values.

### Strategy

1. **Sorting Tasks**:
   - To minimize the initial energy required, we need to strategically choose the order of tasks.
   - Sort the tasks by the difference `(minimum - actual)`. Execute tasks with a higher difference earlier, because tasks with greater `minimum` values and lower `actual` values should be completed earlier to ensure future tasks have enough energy.

2. **Greedy Approach**:
   - Iterate through the sorted tasks, and ensure that at every task, we have enough energy to start it, then deduct the `actual` energy spent.

3. **Calculation**:
   - Track the total energy spent and the minimum initial energy needed.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int minimumEffort(int[][] tasks) {
        // Sort tasks based on the difference (minimum - actual) in a descending order
        Arrays.sort(tasks, (a, b) -> (b[1] - b[0]) - (a[1] - a[0]));
        
        int initialEnergy = 0; // This represents our minimum initial energy
        int currentEnergy = 0; // This represents our current energy level
        
        for (int[] task : tasks) {
            if (currentEnergy < task[1]) {
                initialEnergy += (task[1] - currentEnergy);
                currentEnergy = task[1];
            }
            currentEnergy -= task[0];
        }
        
        return initialEnergy;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        // Example usage
        int[][] tasks = {{1, 2}, {2, 4}, {4, 8}};
        System.out.println(sol.minimumEffort(tasks)); // Output: 8
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of tasks.
- **Iteration**: `O(n)` to iterate over the tasks.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`. This is efficient enough given the constraints.
