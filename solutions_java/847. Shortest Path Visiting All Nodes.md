[Leetcode 847. Shortest Path Visiting All Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l847)
### Problem Statement
You have an undirected, connected graph of `N` nodes labeled from `0` to `N-1`. You are given an array `graph` where `graph[i]` is a list of all the nodes connected with node `i` by an edge.

Return the length of the shortest path that visits every node. You may start and stop at any node, and you can revisit nodes multiple times along the path.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can we assume that the input graph is always connected?**
    - Yes, the problem states that the graph is undirected and connected.
2. **Are there any constraints on the size of N?**
    - The constraints are generally mentioned in the problem description. From Leetcode, typically N â‰¤ 12 which allows for complex algorithms like bitmasking and dynamic programming.
3. **Should the solution handle self-loops or multiple edges between nodes?**
    - According to typical problem constraints, we can assume no self-loops and a single edge between any two nodes.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm combined with bit masking to keep track of visited nodes. The essential idea is:

1. **State Representation:**
    - Use a tuple `(current_node, visited_nodes_mask)` to represent the state in the BFS.
    - `visited_nodes_mask` is a bitmask integer where each bit represents whether a node has been visited.

2. **Initial States:**
    - Start BFS from every node to cover all possible starting points.

3. **Queue and Visited Set:**
    - Use a queue to facilitate BFS and a set to track visited states to avoid processing the same state multiple times.

4. **Processing:**
    - For each state, explore all neighboring nodes and update the bitmask to include the newly visited node.

5. **Termination:**
    - The BFS terminates when the `visited_nodes_mask` equals `(1 << N) - 1`, indicating all nodes have been visited.

### Code
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int shortestPathLength(int[][] graph) {
        int n = graph.length;
        int finalMask = (1 << n) - 1;  // All nodes visited mask
        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
        
        // Initialize the queue with all nodes
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int mask = 1 << i;
            queue.add(new int[]{i, mask, 0});
            visited.add(i + "," + mask);
        }
        
        while(!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] curr = queue.poll();
            int node = curr[0], mask = curr[1], cost = curr[2];
            
            // If all nodes are visited
            if (mask == finalMask) {
                return cost;
            }
            
            // Visit all the neighbors
            for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
                int nextMask = mask | (1 << neighbor);
                String state = neighbor + "," + nextMask;
                if (!visited.contains(state)) {
                    queue.add(new int[]{neighbor, nextMask, cost + 1});
                    visited.add(state);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return -1;  // This statement should never be reached if the graph is connected.
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[][] graph1 = // use example above
        System.out.println(sol.shortestPathLength(graph1));  // Output: 4
        
        int[][] graph2 = // use example above
        System.out.println(sol.shortestPathLength(graph2));  // Output: 4
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(N \cdot 2^N)\)
  - Each node/state combination can be visited at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(N \cdot 2^N)\)
  - The queue and set can grow in size up to all possible node/state combinations.

This ensures an efficient traversal of all possible states to find the shortest path that visits every node in the undirected graph.
