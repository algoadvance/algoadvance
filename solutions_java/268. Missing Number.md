[Leetcode 268. Missing Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l268)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` containing `n` distinct numbers in the range `[0, n]`, return the only number in the range that is missing from the array.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [3,0,1]
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [0,1]
Output: 2
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [9,6,4,2,3,5,7,0,1]
Output: 8
```

**Constraints:**
- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^4`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= n`
- All the numbers of `nums` are unique.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the input array always guaranteed to have a missing number?**
   Yes, the problem guarantees that one number in the range `[0, n]` is missing.

2. **Can the input array be empty?**
   No, according to the constraints, `n >= 1`.

### Strategy

1. **Mathematical Approach:**
   - Calculate the expected sum of the first `n` natural numbers using the formula `n * (n + 1) / 2`.
   - Calculate the actual sum of the elements in the array.
   - The difference between the expected sum and the actual sum will yield the missing number.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) - We only need a single pass through the array to calculate the sum.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - We use a constant amount of space.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int missingNumber(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        // Sum of first `n` natural numbers
        int expectedSum = n * (n + 1) / 2;
        int actualSum = 0;
        
        // Calculate the sum of elements in the array
        for (int num : nums) {
            actualSum += num;
        }
        
        // The missing number is the difference between expected and actual sums
        return expectedSum - actualSum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        
        // Test cases
        int[] testCase1 = {3, 0, 1};
        System.out.println(solution.missingNumber(testCase1)); // Output: 2

        int[] testCase2 = {0, 1};
        System.out.println(solution.missingNumber(testCase2)); // Output: 2
        
        int[] testCase3 = {9, 6, 4, 2, 3, 5, 7, 0, 1};
        System.out.println(solution.missingNumber(testCase3)); // Output: 8
    }
}
```

This solution calculates the expected sum of numbers from `0` to `n`, then subtracts the actual sum of the numbers in the array from it to find the missing number. This method is efficient and direct.
