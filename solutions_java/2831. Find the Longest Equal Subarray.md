[Leetcode 2831. Find the Longest Equal Subarray full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2831)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Find the length of the longest subarray with an equal number of distinct elements (all elements in that subarray are the same), and it is allowed to remove at most `k` elements to achieve this condition.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the size of the input array?**
   - The array length can be up to 10^5.

2. **What is the range of values for the elements in the array?**
   - The elements can range from 1 to 10^9.

3. **Can `k` be zero?**
   - Yes, `k` can be zero, which means no elements can be removed.

4. **Are there negative numbers in the array?**
   - The problem statement implies that the array contains only positive integers.

5. **Is the longest subarray required to be contiguous?**
   - Yes, the subarray is contiguous.

## Strategy

1. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - We can use a sliding window with two pointers to find the longest subarray.
   - Use a frequency map to count occurrences of each element in the current window.
   - For each element, calculate the number of removals needed to make all elements in the window equal to the most frequent element.
   - Adjust the window size dynamically by removing elements from the left when the number of removals exceeds `k`.

2. **Steps**:
   - Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the current window.
   - Maintain a frequency map to store the frequencies of elements within the window.
   - Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer.
   - Calculate the maximum frequency in the current window.
   - If the size of the window minus the maximum frequency exceeds `k`, shrink the window from the left.
   - Keep track of the maximum length of such a window during iterations.

3. **Time Complexity**:
   - The time complexity should be O(n) since both pointers traverse each element of the array at most once, and operations involving the frequency map are constant time due to average-case performance.

## Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class LongestEqualSubarray {
    public int findLongestEqualSubarray(int[] nums, int k) {
        int left = 0, maxLength = 0, maxFreq = 0;
        Map<Integer, Integer> freqMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
            int num = nums[right];
            freqMap.put(num, freqMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
            maxFreq = Math.max(maxFreq, freqMap.get(num));
            
            // Calculate the current window size
            int currentWindowSize = right - left + 1;
            
            // If the number of elements to remove to make the remaining elements all equal exceeds k, shrink the window
            if (currentWindowSize - maxFreq > k) {
                int leftNum = nums[left];
                freqMap.put(leftNum, freqMap.get(leftNum) - 1);
                left++;
            } else {
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentWindowSize);
            }
        }
        return maxLength;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LongestEqualSubarray le = new LongestEqualSubarray();
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 2, 1, 1};
        int k = 1;
        System.out.println(le.findLongestEqualSubarray(nums, k)); // Output should be 4
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the input array. Each element is processed at most twice (once when the `right` pointer includes it in the window, and once when the `left` pointer excludes it).
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), in the worst case where all elements are different, the frequency map will store all elements.

This strategy and implementation should efficiently solve the problem within the given constraints.
