[Leetcode 2956. Find Common Elements Between Two Arrays full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2956)
### Problem Statement
Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, write a function `findCommonElements` that returns an array containing the common elements between the two arrays. Each element in the result array must be unique.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size**: What is the maximum size of the input arrays?
   - Assume there is no explicit constraint on size, but they can be quite large (up to millions of elements).
   
2. **Order of Output**: Does the order of the common elements in the output array matter?
   - No, the order of elements in the output array does not matter.

3. **Duplicates**: Should duplicates in the input arrays be considered more than once in the output?
   - No, the result should contain unique common elements only.

4. **Types of Elements**: Can the input arrays contain negative numbers?
   - Yes, the input arrays can contain any integers including negative numbers.

### Strategy
1. **Set Operations**:
   - Utilize sets to find common elements since sets inherently manage uniqueness and provide efficient operations.
   - Convert each array into a set to remove duplicates within the same array.
   - Use set intersection to determine common elements between the two sets.

2. **Steps**:
   - Convert both arrays into sets.
   - Use the intersection operation to find common elements between the two sets.
   - Convert the resulting set back into an array and return it.

### Code
```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class Solution {
    public int[] findCommonElements(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        Set<Integer> set1 = new HashSet<>();
        Set<Integer> set2 = new HashSet<>();

        // Convert first array to a set
        for (int num : nums1) {
            set1.add(num);
        }

        // Convert second array to a set
        for (int num : nums2) {
            set2.add(num);
        }

        // Find the intersection of the two sets
        set1.retainAll(set2);

        // Convert the result set to an array
        int[] result = new int[set1.size()];
        int index = 0;
        for (int num : set1) {
            result[index++] = num;
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Construction of Sets**: O(n + m) where `n` is the length of `nums1` and `m` is the length of `nums2`.
- **Intersection Operation**: O(min(n, m)) on average for set intersection.
- **Total Complexity**: O(n + m), since constructing the sets and performing the intersection are linear in the size of the input arrays.

### Space Complexity
- **Space for Sets**: O(n + m) to store elements from both arrays.
- **Result Space**: O(min(n, m)) for the resultant array holding common elements.
- **Total Space**: O(n + m) due to the sets used to hold elements from both arrays.
