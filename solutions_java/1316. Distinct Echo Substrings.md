[Leetcode 1316. Distinct Echo Substrings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1316)
## Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 1316: Distinct Echo Substrings

Given a string `text`, return the number of distinct non-empty substrings of `text` that can be written as the concatenation of some string with itself (i.e., it can be written as `a + a` where `a` is some string).

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Length of the String**
   - What is the maximum length of the string?
     - The length of `text` is <= 2000.
     
2. **Characters in the String**
   - Does the string contain only lowercase English letters?
     - Yes, the string contains only lowercase English letters.

3. **Duplicates**
   - Should we count duplicate substrings or only unique ones?
     - Only unique (distinct) substrings should be counted.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to identify all substrings that can be written as `a + a` (concatenation of a string with itself).

### Steps

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a `HashSet` to track distinct echo substrings.

2. **Loop Through Possible Substring Lengths**:
   - Consider substrings of lengths 2, 4, 6, ..., up to the length of the string.
   - For each length `2 * i` (where `i` is the length of the repeated string `a`), check the substrings.

3. **Check Substrings**:
   - For each possible starting index, extract the substring of length `i` and its next `i` characters.
   - If they are identical, add the concatenation (`a + a`) to the `HashSet`.

4. **Count Unique Echo Substrings**:
   - The size of the `HashSet` gives the number of distinct echo substrings.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashSet;

public class DistinctEchoSubstrings {

    public int distinctEchoSubstrings(String text) {
        HashSet<String> echoSubstrings = new HashSet<>();
        int length = text.length();
        
        // Loop through all possible lengths of `a`
        for (int i = 1; i <= length / 2; i++) {
            // For each `i`, we are checking substrings of length `2 * i`
            for (int j = 0; j + 2 * i <= length; j++) {
                String a = text.substring(j, j + i);
                String b = text.substring(j + i, j + 2 * i);
                
                if (a.equals(b)) {
                    echoSubstrings.add(a + b);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return echoSubstrings.size();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DistinctEchoSubstrings des = new DistinctEchoSubstrings();
        String text = "abcabcabc";
        System.out.println(des.distinctEchoSubstrings(text)); // Example usage
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Outer Loop (i)**: Maximum value is `length / 2`.
- **Inner Loop (j)**: Runs for `O(length) - 2 * i` for each `i`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is approximated as `O(n^2)` where `n` is the length of the input string.

This approach will efficiently solve the problem within the given constraints of the string length being up to 2000 characters.
