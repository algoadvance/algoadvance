[Leetcode 1006. Clumsy Factorial](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1006)
### Problem Statement

1006. Clumsy Factorial

Usually, the factorial of a positive integer `n` is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to `n`. For example, `factorial(10)` is `10 * 9 * 8 * 7 * 6 * 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1`.

However, we can define a clumsy factorial by using the integers in decreasing order, swapping out the multiplication operator (`*`) for division (`/`), addition (`+`), and subtraction (`-`) in a cyclic way. The expression is evaluated using the operators in the precedence order of `*`, `/`, `+`, and `-`.

For example, `clumsy(10)` is defined as:
`10 * 9 / 8 + 7 - 6 * 5 / 4 + 3 - 2 * 1`.

Implement the `clumsy` function. Given an integer `n`, you need to return the clumsy factorial of `n`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: What is the maximum value of `n`?**
   - A: The typical constraint for such Leetcode problems is `1 <= n <= 10000`.

2. **Q: How should the intermediate results be handled?**
   - A: Use integer division and integer arithmetic.

3. **Q: Do we start the cyclic operations from the largest number down to 1?**
   - A: Yes, we use the operations in a pattern of `*`, `/`, `+`, and `-`, starting with the largest number, moving to the smallest.

### Strategy

1. Use a stack to handle the changing precedence of operations.
2. Iterate through the numbers from `n` down to `1`, applying the operations cyclically.
3. Push results into a stack where appropriate and resolve the stack operations at the '+' or '-' steps to account for operator precedence.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), since we go through numbers from `n` to `1` once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), due to stack utilization which can hold up to n/4 elements in the worst case.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class ClumsyFactorial {

    public int clumsy(int n) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        stack.push(n);
        n--;
        
        // The index will determine the operation
        int index = 0;
        
        while (n > 0) {
            if (index % 4 == 0) {
                stack.push(stack.pop() * n);
            } else if (index % 4 == 1) {
                stack.push(stack.pop() / n);
            } else if (index % 4 == 2) {
                stack.push(n);
            } else {
                stack.push(-n);
            }
            index++;
            n--;
        }
        
        // Sum up the stack elements
        int result = 0;
        for (int num : stack) {
            result += num;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ClumsyFactorial cf = new ClumsyFactorial();
        System.out.println(cf.clumsy(10)); // Example: Expected output: 12
        System.out.println(cf.clumsy(4));  // Example: Expected output: 7
    }
}
```

Make sure to test with edge cases, such as very small `n` (e.g., `n = 1` to confirm minimal operations). Each iteration we handle the operations cyclically ensuring correct application of operations based on their order and precedence as per stack handling.
