### Problem Statement

**Leetcode Problem 757: Set Intersection Size At Least Two**

An integer interval `[a, b]` (for integers `a < b`) is a set of all consecutive integers from `a` to `b`, including `a` and `b`.

Find the minimum size of a set `S` such that for every interval `[a, b]` in the given list, there are at least two integers from `S` present in the interval.

### Example

```java
Input: intervals = [[1,3],[1,4],[2,5],[3,5]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Consider the set S = {2, 3, 4}. The minimum size of set S is 3.

Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[2,4],[4,5]]
Output: 5
Explanation: Consider the set S = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. The minimum size of set S is 5.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the input intervals?**
   - The input consists of intervals with integer limits, where `a < b`.
2. **How should the result be returned?**
   - The result should be the size of the set `S`.

### Strategy

1. **Sort Intervals**: First, sort the intervals by their ending point in ascending order. If two intervals have the same endpoint, sort by their starting point in descending order. Sorting by the ending point helps to always try to cover intervals as soon as possible with minimum overlap.

2. **Track Coverage**: Use a greedy strategy to cover each interval with at least two points. Keep track of the last two points added to the set `S`.

3. **Add Points**: For each interval:
   - If neither of the last two points falls within the interval, add the last two points of the interval to the set.
   - If only one of the last two points falls within the interval, add the endpoint of the interval to the set.

### Code

Here's the Java implementation:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int intersectionSizeTwo(int[][] intervals) {
        // Sort intervals first by end point in ascending order,
        // if end points are the same, sort by start point in descending order
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> a[1] == b[1] ? Integer.compare(b[0], a[0]) : Integer.compare(a[1], b[1]));
        
        // Variables to keep track of the last two points added to the set S
        int size = 0;
        int p1 = -1;
        int p2 = -1;
        
        for (int[] interval : intervals) {
            // If p1 and p2 are not in the interval
            if (interval[0] > p2) {
                // Add two new points
                p1 = interval[1] - 1;
                p2 = interval[1];
                size += 2;
            } else if (interval[0] > p1) {
                // If interval contains p2 but not p1, add one new point
                p1 = p2;
                p2 = interval[1];
                size += 1;
            }
        }
        return size;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: Sorting the intervals takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Processing Intervals**: Each interval is processed in \(O(1)\) time.
- **Overall**: The overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\) where \(n\) is the number of intervals.
