[Leetcode 1289. Minimum Falling Path Sum II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1289)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `grid`. Return the minimum sum of a falling path with non-zero shifts.

A falling path with non-zero shifts is a path that starts at any element in the first row and chooses one element from each row. The next row's element must be in a different column from the previous row's element by dynamically shifting either left or right, but not staying in the same column.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the grid contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the grid can contain negative numbers as well as positive numbers.
2. **What is the size of the grid?**
   - The grid is an `n x n` matrix where `n >= 1` and typically `n <= 200`.
3. **Can we have a grid with only one row?**
   - Yes, though such a case would be trivial since the minimum path would just be the minimum element in that row.
4. **What are the constraints?**
   - Each element of the matrix is an integer in the range `-10^4` to `10^4`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we need to make use of dynamic programming. We will maintain a `dp` array where `dp[i][j]` will store the minimum falling path sum starting from element `(i, j)`.

1. **DP Initialization**: Initialize the first row of `dp` with the values of the first row of the grid, since those are the starting points.
2. **DP Transition**:
   - For each subsequent row, calculate the possible minimum path sums by considering all columns except the column of the direct previous row to ensure non-zero shifts.
   - To do this efficiently, track the smallest and the second smallest values in the previous row, to avoid having to iterate through all columns each time.
3. **Result Extraction**: The minimum value in the last row of `dp` will give us the desired result.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minFallingPathSum(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        
        // We'll use 2 arrays to represent the current and the previous row of dp values for space optimization
        int[] prevRow = grid[0].clone();
        int[] currentRow = new int[n];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            // Find the smallest and the second smallest in the prevRow
            int min1 = Integer.MAX_VALUE, min2 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            int idx1 = -1;

            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (prevRow[j] < min1) {
                    min2 = min1; 
                    min1 = prevRow[j];
                    idx1 = j;
                } else if (prevRow[j] < min2) {
                    min2 = prevRow[j];
                }
            }
            
            // Fill in the currentRow dp values
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                // If same column as minimum, use second minimum
                currentRow[j] = grid[i][j] + (j == idx1 ? min2 : min1);
            }
            
            // Update prevRow to be currentRow
            prevRow = currentRow.clone();
        }
        
        // The result will be the minimum in the last row of dp
        int result = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int num : prevRow) {
            result = Math.min(result, num);
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n^2)` where `n` is the size of the grid. Each row requires O(n) operations for finding the minimum and O(n) operations to update the current row.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for the DP arrays, as we are only keeping the current and previous row.

This solution efficiently calculates the minimum falling path sum with non-zero shifts using dynamic programming and tracking the minimum values from previous rows to ensure the shifts are managed correctly.
