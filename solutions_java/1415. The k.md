[Leetcode 1415. The k](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1415)
## Problem Statement
A **happy string** is a string that:
1. Consists only of the letters 'a', 'b', 'c'.
2. Does not have any two consecutive characters that are the same.

Given two integers `n` and `k`, return the k-th lexicographical string of all happy strings of length `n`. If there are fewer than `k` happy strings of length `n`, return an empty string.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of `n` and `k`?**
   - Typically, for coding problems like this, `n` could be between 1 and 10, and `k` could be any integer within the range of possible happy strings.
2. **What characters are allowed in the string?**
   - Only the characters 'a', 'b', 'c' are allowed, and no two consecutive characters can be the same.

## Strategy
To solve the problem efficiently, we can employ backtracking to generate all happy strings of length `n` in lexicographical order and return the k-th string if it exists. Here's the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Initialize Variables:** Create a list to store happy strings.
2. **Backtracking Function:** Implement a backtracking function to:
   - Keep track of the current string being formed.
   - Add new characters ('a', 'b', 'c') ensuring no two consecutive characters are the same.
   - If the current string length reaches `n`, add it to the list of happy strings.
3. **Generate and Return:** Generate happy strings until we reach the k-th string or exhaust all possibilities.

## Code
Here is the Java implementation:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    
    public String getHappyString(int n, int k) {
        List<String> happyStrings = new ArrayList<>();
        backtrack(happyStrings, new StringBuilder(), n);
        
        if (k > happyStrings.size()) {
            return "";
        }
        return happyStrings.get(k - 1);
    }
    
    private void backtrack(List<String> happyStrings, StringBuilder sb, int n) {
        if (sb.length() == n) {
            happyStrings.add(sb.toString());
            return;
        }
        
        for (char c : new char[]{'a', 'b', 'c'}) {
            if (sb.length() == 0 || sb.charAt(sb.length() - 1) != c) {
                sb.append(c);
                backtrack(happyStrings, sb, n);
                sb.deleteCharAt(sb.length() - 1);  // backtrack
            }
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.getHappyString(3, 9)); // Sample test case
        System.out.println(sol.getHappyString(1, 3));
        System.out.println(sol.getHappyString(4, 5));
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of generating all possible happy strings using the backtracking approach is primarily determined by the number of valid combinations:
- For a length `n`, there are `2 * 3^{n-1}` valid happy strings.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity will be O(3^n) but constrained by the need to store results and compare strings lexicographically.

This solution ensures that we're both generating happy strings in lexicographical order and can halt early if we reach the desired `k`th string without exploring unnecessary combinations.
