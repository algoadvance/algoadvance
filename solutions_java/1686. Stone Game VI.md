[Leetcode 1686. Stone Game VI](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1686)
## Problem Statement

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

There are `n` stones in a pile. On each player's turn, they either remove one stone from the pile or remove `a` stones from the pile. If a player cannot make a move, they lose.

Given three integers `n`, `a`, and `b` representing the number of stones in the pile and the two possible amounts of stones that can be removed on each turn, determine whether Alice has a winning strategy, assuming both players play optimally.

The problem may be summarized as:

- `n`: the number of stones in the pile.
- `a`: the number of stones one can optionally remove (not just 1 stone at a time).

Output `True` if Alice can win the game, or `False` if Bob can force a win.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the values of `a` and `b` distinct and greater than 1?**
   It's important to confirm if the game setup allows removing stones either one by one or using the exact number specified.
   
2. **What is the starting number of stones (`n`) in the problem?**
   This could affect the winning strategy for Alice.

3. **Can `n` be any non-negative integer or is it restricted to positive integers?**
   This would be important to consider edge cases.

## Strategy

The game can be modeled using dynamic programming. Let `dp[i]` be `True` if the state with `i` stones is a winning state for Alice (i.e., she can force a win starting with `i` stones).

### Approach:
1. Initialize a boolean array `dp` of size `n + 1` where `dp[i]` is False by default.
2. Iterate through each possible pile size from 0 to `n` and determine if it's a winning state for Alice by checking if there is any move that leaves Bob in a losing state.
3. Use the transitions:
   - `dp[i]` is `True` if Bob would be left in a losing state (`dp[i-1]` is `False` or `dp[i-a]` is `False`) after Alice's move.

### Transition Dynamics:
- `dp[0]` is `False` since no stones mean the player to move loses (which starts with Bob).
- For all `i` from 1 to `n`:
  - `dp[i] = True` if moving to `dp[i - 1]` (if `i - 1 >= 0`) or `dp[i - a]` (if `i - a >= 0`) leaves Bob in a losing state.

## Time Complexity

The dynamic programming solution runs in `O(n)` because we're iterating through each state once and determining the optimal move.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean canWinGame(int n, int a) {
        // Initialize a boolean array to store if Alice can win with i stones
        boolean[] dp = new boolean[n + 1];

        // base case is already False by default: dp[0] = False (losing state for Alice when n = 0)
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            // Alice can win if she can move to a state where Bob is in a losing state
            if (i - 1 >= 0 && !dp[i - 1]) {
                dp[i] = true;
            } else if (i - a >= 0 && !dp[i - a]) {
                dp[i] = true;
            }
        }

        return dp[n];  // Return if Alice can win with n stones
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        
        // Test cases
        System.out.println(sol.canWinGame(5, 2));  // Example case
        System.out.println(sol.canWinGame(10, 3)); // Example case
        System.out.println(sol.canWinGame(1, 2));  // Edge case
        System.out.println(sol.canWinGame(7, 4));  // Edge case
    }
}
```

This code helps determine if Alice can win the game starting with `n` stones, given that she has the option to remove 1 or `a` stones optimally. The dynamic programming approach ensures an efficient solution with linear time complexity.
