[Leetcode 2130. Maximum Twin Sum of a Linked List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2130)
### Problem Statement

You are given the head of a linked list containing an even number of nodes. The nodes are indexed from 0 to (n - 1). The nodes have integers values on them. This linked list does have a twin sum. The "twin sum" is defined as the sum of node value at index `i` and node value at index `(n - 1 - i)`. Find the maximum twin sum of the linked list.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for the node values?**
   - Node values can be any integer.

2. **Are there any constraints on the size of the linked list?**
   - Yes, the list will contain an even number of nodes.

3. **Is it guaranteed that the linked list will have an even number of nodes?**
   - Yes, the problem guarantees it.

4. **Can the linked list be empty?**
   - No, the constraint is that it will have at least two nodes since it is an even number.

### Strategy

1. **Finding the Middle of the List:**
   - Use the slow and fast pointer technique to find the middle of the linked list.

2. **Reversing the Second Half:**
   - Reverse the second half of the linked list.

3. **Calculating the Twin Sum and Finding the Maximum:**
   - Traverse the two halves of the linked list simultaneously to compute the twin sums and track the maximum twin sum encountered.

### Code

Here's how you can solve the problem in Java:

```java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode(int x) { 
        val = x; 
        next = null; 
    }
}

public class Solution {
    public int pairSum(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Step 1: Find the middle of the linked list
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head;
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }

        // Step 2: Reverse the second half of the linked list
        ListNode prev = null, curr = slow;
        while (curr != null) {
            ListNode next = curr.next;
            curr.next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = next;
        }

        // Step 3: Calculate the twin sums and find the maximum
        int maxTwinSum = 0;
        ListNode first = head, second = prev;
        while (second != null) {
            maxTwinSum = Math.max(maxTwinSum, first.val + second.val);
            first = first.next;
            second = second.next;
        }

        return maxTwinSum;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Finding the Middle:** `O(n)`
- **Reversing the Second Half:** `O(n)`
- **Calculating the Twin Sum:** `O(n)`

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is `O(1)` since we're only using a constant amount of extra space for pointers.
