[Leetcode 2055. Plates Between Candles](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2055)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` consisting of '*' and '|' symbols. The '*' represents a plate and the '|' represents a candle. You are also given a 2D array `queries`, where each query `[left, right]` asks you to find the number of plates between the left-th and right-th candles.

More formally, for each query, you have to find the substring `s[left...right]` and return the number of '*' characters between the first and last '|' in the substring. If there are no '|' characters in the substring `s[left...right]`, then the answer to that query is 0.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the string `s` contain only '*' symbols in some cases?**
   - Yes, it can, and in such cases, the result for any query would be 0 since there would be no candles to define a boundary.
2. **What should be returned if there is only one candle within the queried range?**
   - The result should be 0 because we need at least two candles to define the 'between' space.

### Strategy
To efficiently answer the queries:

1. **Preprocess the string**:
   - Create an array `leftCandle` where `leftCandle[i]` represents the index of the closest '|' to the left of or at position `i`.
   - Create an array `rightCandle` where `rightCandle[i]` represents the index of the closest '|' to the right of or at position `i`.
   - Create an array `platesPrefix` where `platesPrefix[i]` holds the cumulative number of plates up to index `i`.

2. **Answer each query efficiently**:
   - Use the preprocessed arrays to quickly determine the number of plates between the boundaries defined by the nearest candles.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class PlatesBetweenCandles {
    public int[] platesBetweenCandles(String s, int[][] queries) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[] leftCandle = new int[n];
        int[] rightCandle = new int[n];
        int[] platesPrefix = new int[n];

        // Preprocess leftCandle array
        int lastCandle = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '|') {
                lastCandle = i;
            }
            leftCandle[i] = lastCandle;
        }

        // Preprocess rightCandle array
        lastCandle = -1;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '|') {
                lastCandle = i;
            }
            rightCandle[i] = lastCandle;
        }

        // Preprocess platesPrefix array
        int platesCount = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '*') {
                platesCount++;
            }
            platesPrefix[i] = platesCount;
        }

        // Result array
        int[] result = new int[queries.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < queries.length; i++) {
            int left = queries[i][0];
            int right = queries[i][1];
            int start = rightCandle[left];
            int end = leftCandle[right];
            if (start != -1 && end != -1 && start < end) {
                result[i] = platesPrefix[end] - platesPrefix[start];
            }
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PlatesBetweenCandles solution = new PlatesBetweenCandles();
        String s = "**|**|***|";
        int[][] queries = {{2, 5}, {5, 9}};
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(solution.platesBetweenCandles(s, queries))); // Output: [2, 3]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Preprocessing**:
   - `leftCandle`, `rightCandle`, and `platesPrefix` arrays each take \(O(n)\) time.
2. **Query Processing**:
   - Each query can be answered in \(O(1)\) time due to preprocessed data.

**Overall**: With \(m\) as the number of queries, the total time complexity is \(O(n + m)\).
