[Leetcode 1995. Count Special Quadruplets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1995)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of `n` integers, return the number of **special quadruplets** `(a, b, c, d)` that satisfy the following conditions:
1. `0 <= a < b < c < d < n`
2. `nums[a] + nums[b] + nums[c] == nums[d]`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**: What is the range of `n` and the values in `nums`?
   - Typically for competitive programming, `n` could go up to a few thousand. The values in `nums` are generally within the range of standard integer limits.
   
2. **Distinct Elements**: Are all elements in `nums` distinct?
   - The problem doesn't specify that the numbers are distinct, so we assume they can have duplicates.

3. **Target Complexity**: Is there a preferred time complexity we should aim for?
   - Because of the nature of the problem, a brute-force approach would have a time complexity of `O(n^4)`. However, optimizations should be attempted to reduce it if possible.

## Strategy

A brute-force approach would involve iterating over all possible quadruplets, but that results in `O(n^4)` complexity, which is not efficient for large `n`.

### Optimized Approach
1. **Dictionary Based Storage**: Utilize a HashMap to store sums of pairs of indices as we iterate.
2. **Iterate Efficiently**: As we choose the fourth element, leverage stored pairs sums to find the required combination efficiently.

We will approach this problem in two main steps:
1. Use a nested loop to generate sums and store them in a dictionary.
2. Use another set of loops to look for quadruplets based on precomputed sums.

### Pseudo Code Outline
1. Iterate over `c` and `d` in nested loops.
2. For each `c` and `d`, iterate over pairs of indices for sums before `c`.
3. Utilize a HashMap to check if the required sum exists.

## Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    public int countQuadruplets(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int count = 0;
        Map<Integer, Integer> sumPairs = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Loop through each element considering it as d where 3 <= d < n
        for (int d = n - 1; d >= 3; d--) {
            // Update the sumPairs map by considering pairs nums[b] + nums[c]
            for (int c = d - 1; c >= 2; c--) {
                int target = nums[d] - nums[c];
                if (sumPairs.containsKey(target)) {
                    count += sumPairs.get(target);
                }
            }
            
            // Update the sumPairs map by considering pairs nums[a] + nums[b] before c
            for (int b = 0; b < d - 2; b++) {
                for (int a = 0; a < b; a++) {
                    int sum = nums[a] + nums[b];
                    sumPairs.put(sum, sumPairs.getOrDefault(sum, 0) + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing**: O(n^4) - For the quadruple nested loops to check each possible combination.
- **Optimized**: O(n^3) - Efficiently utilize a HashMap to reduce redundant calculations and avoid having to check every possible combination explicitly.

Thus, our solution has an overall time complexity of `O(n^3)`, which is a significant improvement over bruteforce methods for large `n`.

With this approach, large arrays up to the typical competitive programming limits (like 1000) can be handled efficiently within time constraints.
