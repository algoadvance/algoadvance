[Leetcode 589. N](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l589)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `n-ary` tree. Implement the `preorder` traversal. The n-ary tree is represented by its root node. Implement a function `preorder(Node root)` that returns a list of node values in pre-order traversal.

**Example:**
```
          1
       /  |  \
      3   2   4
     / \
    5   6

Input: root = [1,[3,[5,6],2,4]]
Output: [1,3,5,6,2,4]
```
**Note:** The format in the input example is the tree’s root node followed by its children, the children’s children, and so on, in the form of an array list.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the tree be empty?
   **A:** Yes, the tree can be empty, in which case the root will be `null` and the function should return an empty list.

2. **Q:** Will the tree contain only integer values?
   **A:** For the sake of this problem, yes, you can assume the node values are integers.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach since Preorder traversal follows the sequence: root -> children.

We can implement this using either a recursive or an iterative approach.

- **Recursive Approach:** Define a helper method that visits a node, adds its value to the result list, and then recursively visits each of its children.
  
- **Iterative Approach:** Use a stack to simulate the call stack of recursion. Push nodes onto the stack, pop them to visit, and push their children in reverse order to ensure the left-most child is processed first.

### Time Complexity
- Both the recursive and iterative approaches have a time complexity of **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree, because we visit each node exactly once.
- The space complexity is **O(n)** in both cases due to the call stack used in recursion or the stack used in iteratively traversing the tree.

### Code

We will implement both the recursive and iterative solutions:

#### Recursive Approach

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> children;

    public Node() {}

    public Node(int val) {
        this.val = val;
    }

    public Node(int val, List<Node> children) {
        this.val = val;
        this.children = children;
    }
}

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> preorder(Node root) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        helper(root, result);
        return result;
    }

    private void helper(Node node, List<Integer> result) {
        if (node == null) {
            return;
        }
        
        // Add the root node value
        result.add(node.val);
        
        // Recursively visit all children
        for (Node child : node.children) {
            helper(child, result);
        }
    }
}
```

#### Iterative Approach

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Stack;

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> preorder(Node root) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        if (root == null) {
            return result;
        }
        
        Stack<Node> stack = new Stack<>();
        stack.push(root);
        
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            Node node = stack.pop();
            result.add(node.val);
            
            // Push children onto the stack in reverse order
            List<Node> children = node.children;
            for (int i = children.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
                stack.push(children.get(i));
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

Both implementations correctly solve the problem, enabling the traversal of an n-ary tree in preorder manner.
