[Leetcode 2108. Find First Palindromic String in the Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2108)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `words`. Your task is to find the first palindromic string in the array. A string is called a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward. If there is no such string, return an empty string `""`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What should be returned if the input array is empty?
   - **A:** Return an empty string `""`.
   
2. **Q:** Are the strings in the array always lower case?
   - **A:** Yes, for the purpose of this problem, the strings can be considered to be in lower case.

3. **Q:** How do I handle strings with mixed or upper-case letters?
   - **A:** Assume all strings are in lower case.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate through the array**: Start from the first element and check each string.
2. **Check if each string is a palindrome**: For each string, compare the characters from the beginning and the end towards the center.
3. **Return the first palindromic string**: If a palindrome is found, return it immediately. If no palindrome is found by the end of the loop, return an empty string.

### Code

Here's a possible implementation in Java to achieve the solution:

```java
public class Solution {
    public String firstPalindrome(String[] words) {
        for (String word : words) {
            if (isPalindrome(word)) {
                return word;
            }
        }
        return "";
    }

    private boolean isPalindrome(String word) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = word.length() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            if (word.charAt(left) != word.charAt(right)) {
                return false;
            }
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        return true;
    }

    // Driver code to test the solution
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        String[] words = {"abc", "car", "ada", "racecar", "cool"};
        System.out.println(solution.firstPalindrome(words)); // Output: "ada"
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Checking if a string is a palindrome**: O(n), where n is the length of the string.
- **Iterating through the array**: O(m), where m is the number of strings in the array.

Therefore, the total time complexity is **O(m * L)**, where **L** is the maximum length of any string in the array. This ensures that our solution is efficient even for relatively large arrays of strings.
