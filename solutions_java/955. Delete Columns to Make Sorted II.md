[Leetcode 955. Delete Columns to Make Sorted II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l955)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of `n` strings `strs`, all of the same length.

We say that a column `j` of a `matrix` is **sorted** if `strs[i][j] <= strs[i+1][j]` for all `i` (0 <= i < n - 1). We can delete any number of columns, and return the minimum number of columns that we need to delete to ensure that all the remaining columns are **sorted** in lexicographical order.

#### Example:
**Input:**
```text
strs = ["ca", "bb", "ac"]
```
**Output:**
```text
1
```
**Explanation:**
Delete the first column ("c", "b", "a"). The remaining columns are ["a", "b", "c"] which are sorted.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the input guaranteed to have uniform string lengths?**
   - Yes, all strings in the input array are of the same length.

2. **Can there be duplicate strings in the input array?**
   - Yes, there can be duplicate strings.

3. **Do we need to return the actual columns that are deleted or just the count?**
   - We only need to return the count of columns to delete.

### Strategy
1. **Preserve Lexicographical Order**: We need to ensure the remaining columns are sorted in lexicographical order.
2. **Column-by-Column Check**: We'll iterate through each column and check if deleting it can keep the remaining columns sorted or not.
3. **Greedy Column Deletion**: We'll delete a column if it interrupts the lexicographical order.
4. **Tracking Sorted Order**: Use an array to keep track of whether previous rows are sorted up to the current column.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int minDeletionSize(String[] strs) {
        int n = strs.length;
        int m = strs[0].length();
        
        boolean[] sorted = new boolean[n - 1];
        int deleteCount = 0;
        
        for (int col = 0; col < m; col++) {
            boolean toBeDeleted = false;
            
            for (int row = 0; row < n - 1; row++) {
                if (!sorted[row] && strs[row].charAt(col) > strs[row + 1].charAt(col)) {
                    toBeDeleted = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            
            if (toBeDeleted) {
                deleteCount++;
            } else {
                for (int row = 0; row < n - 1; row++) {
                    if (strs[row].charAt(col) < strs[row + 1].charAt(col)) {
                        sorted[row] = true;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return deleteCount;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n * m)
  - We iterate over each column (m) and within each column, we check each row (n-1).
  - Given `n` strings each of length `m`, we have to check each cell, leading to a linear scan relative to the total number of cells in the matrix.

- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - We use an additional boolean array of size `n - 1` to track the sorted status of rows, which is auxiliary space directly proportional to the number of strings.

This solution ensures that we determine the minimum number of columns to delete while maintaining the lexicographical order of the remaining columns.
