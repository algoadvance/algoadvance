[Leetcode 882. Reachable Nodes In Subdivided Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l882)
### Problem Statement

We are given a graph (with nodes from `0` to `N-1`), represented by an array of edges, where each edge is represented as a triplet `(u, v, cnt)` - indicating there's an edge between nodes `u` and `v`, and the edge contains `cnt` new nodes. The graph is initially undirected.

We start at node `0`, and in each move, we can travel to a neighboring node if we have enough moves available (`M` is the maximum allowed moves). 

The goal is to find the maximum number of nodes we can reach.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Edge Cases**: What should we do if there are no edges? Should we assume `cnt` is a non-negative integer?
2. **Input Constraints**: What are the constraints on `N`, `M`, and `cnt`?
3. **Traversal**: Should the move counting consider the new nodes or only the original nodes?

Based on standard competitive programming problems, let's tentatively assume:
- `N` (number of nodes) is between 1 and 300.
- `M` (maximum moves) is between 1 and 10^9.
- `cnt` (new nodes per edge) is between 0 and 10^6.

### Strategy

1. **Transform the Graph**: Each edge with `cnt` new nodes can be transformed into `cnt + 1` smaller edges.
2. **Use Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Given the potentially high value of `cnt`, an efficient shortest path algorithm is required, so we'll apply Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm to calculate the shortest paths from node `0`.
3. **Track Visits**: We need to count not only the nodes from the original graph but also the new nodes created due to edge subdivisions.

### Code

Here is the Java code implementation:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class ReachableNodes {
    
    public static int reachableNodes(int[][] edges, int M, int N) {
        Map<Integer, Map<Integer, Integer>> graph = new HashMap<>();
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            graph.computeIfAbsent(edge[0], e -> new HashMap<>()).put(edge[1], edge[2]);
            graph.computeIfAbsent(edge[1], e -> new HashMap<>()).put(edge[0], edge[2]);
        }

        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        pq.offer(new int[]{0, 0});
        Map<Integer, Integer> dist = new HashMap<>();
        dist.put(0, 0);

        Map<String, Integer> used = new HashMap<>();
        int result = 0;

        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            int[] top = pq.poll();
            int d = top[0], node = top[1];

            if (d > dist.getOrDefault(node, 0)) continue;
            result++;  // Count this node

            if (!graph.containsKey(node)) continue;
            for (int nei : graph.get(node).keySet()) {
                int weight = graph.get(node).get(nei);
                int v = Math.min(weight, M - d);

                used.put(node + "," + nei, v);

                int d2 = d + weight + 1;
                if (d2 < dist.getOrDefault(nei, M + 1)) {
                    pq.offer(new int[]{d2, nei});
                    dist.put(nei, d2);
                }
            }
        }

        // Start counting new nodes along the edges
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0], v = edge[1], cnt = edge[2];
            result += Math.min(cnt, used.getOrDefault(u + "," + v, 0) + used.getOrDefault(v + "," + u, 0));
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] edges = // use example from above
        int M = 7;
        int N = 5;
        System.out.println(reachableNodes(edges, M, N));  // Expected Output: 13
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Graph Construction**: \(O(E)\), where \(E\) is the number of edges.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: \(O((E + V) \log V)\), where \(V\) is the number of vertices.
- **Counting Result**: \(O(E)\).

Thus, the total time complexity is \(O((E + V) \log V)\), which is efficient given the constraints.
