[Leetcode 2902. Count of Sub](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2902)
Sure, let's start with a clear description of the problem statement, followed by a strategy to solve it, and then the corresponding Java code implementation.

### Problem Statement
Given a list of integers `nums`, count all non-empty sub-multisets (a multiset is a generalized set that allows repeated elements) such that the sum of the elements is less than or equal to a given integer `target`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: What are the constraints on the size of `nums` and the values of elements in `nums`?
2. **Edge Cases**: Should we consider cases where `nums` is empty or where `target` is 0?
3. **Output Format**: Should the result be an integer count?

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming:
1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Table**: Let `dp[i][j]` represent the number of sub-multisets that can be formed with the first `i` elements of `nums` that sum up to `j`.
2. **Initialization**: 
   - `dp[0][0] = 1`, meaning there is one way (i.e., taking an empty set) to form a multiset summing up to 0 without any elements.
   - For any other `dp[0][j]` where `j > 0`, the value is 0 because you cannot form a non-zero sum with zero elements.
3. **Transition**: For each element in `nums`, iterate over possible sums in reverse order to consider each element being included or not included:
   - `dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j] + dp[i - 1][j - nums[i - 1]]` if `j >= nums[i - 1]`.

4. **Result Computation**: Sum up all values `dp[n][j]` for `j` from `1` to `target` where `n` is the length of `nums`.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is `O(n * target)` where `n` is the length of `nums` and `target` is the given target sum. This is because we iterate through each element in `nums` and for each element, we iterate over possible sums up to `target`.

### Java Code Implementation
Here is the Java code following the outlined strategy:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int countSubMultisetsWithBoundedSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][target + 1];

        // base case: there is one way to make zero sum with zero items
        dp[0][0] = 1;

        // fill the dp table
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= target; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
                if (j >= nums[i - 1]) {
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][j - nums[i - 1]];
                }
            }
        }

        // calculate the result by summing dp[n][1] to dp[n][target]
        int result = 0;
        for (int j = 1; j <= target; j++) {
            result += dp[n][j];
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3};
        int target = 4;
        System.out.println(solution.countSubMultisetsWithBoundedSum(nums, target)); // Output: 7
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Code
1. **Initialization**: The `dp` array is initialized to store solutions to subproblems.
2. **DP Table Filling**: For each element in `nums`, we update the `dp` table based on whether the current element is part of the sub-multiset or not.
3. **Result Calculation**: We sum up all the possible multisets that have sums from `1` to `target`.

Feel free to test the code with various inputs to ensure it works as expected.
