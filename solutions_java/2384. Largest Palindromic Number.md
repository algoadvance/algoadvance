[Leetcode 2384. Largest Palindromic Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2384)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `num` consisting of digits only. You need to find the largest palindromic number (which could be a single digit) that can be formed by reordering the digits of `num`. If multiple palindromic numbers of the same length can be formed, return the numerically largest one.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the input string?
   - Can the input string have leading zeroes?
   - Is it guaranteed that the input contains at least one digit?

   **Assumptions:**
   - Maximum length of input string can be up to \(10^5\).
   - The input string may contain leading zeroes.
   - The input string is guaranteed to contain at least one digit.

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Should the output string also include leading zeroes if they are part of the largest palindromic number?

   **Assumptions:**
   - The output should not have leading zeroes unless the largest palindromic number is `0`.

### Strategy

1. **Count Frequency of Each Digit:**
   - Use an array to count occurrences of each digit (0-9).
   
2. **Build the First Half:**
   - Traverse the frequency array from the largest digit to the smallest.
   - Add the digit to the first half as many full pairs as possible.
   
3. **Determine the Middle Character:**
   - Identify the largest digit that can be used as the middle digit (a digit with an odd count).
   
4. **Construct the Palindrome:**
   - Mirror the first half to form the second half of the palindrome.
   - Place the middle digit (if any) between the two halves.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If all characters are zeroes, then the largest palindromic number is `0`.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class LargestPalindromicNumber {
    
    public String largestPalindromic(String num) {
        int[] freq = new int[10];
        
        // Count the frequency of each digit
        for (char c : num.toCharArray()) {
            freq[c - '0']++;
        }

        StringBuilder firstHalf = new StringBuilder();
        char middleChar = 0;
        
        // Build the first half of the palindrome
        for (int i = 9; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (freq[i] % 2 == 1) {
                if (middleChar == 0) {
                    middleChar = (char) (i + '0');
                }
            }
            for (int j = 0; j < freq[i] / 2; j++) {
                firstHalf.append(i);
            }
        }
        
        // Handle edge case: If the first character is zero and length is more than 0
        if (firstHalf.length() > 0 && firstHalf.charAt(0) == '0') {
            return "0";
        }
        
        // Construct the full palindrome
        String secondHalf = firstHalf.reverse().toString();
        if (middleChar != 0) {
            return firstHalf.reverse().toString() + middleChar + secondHalf;
        } else {
            return firstHalf.reverse().toString() + secondHalf;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LargestPalindromicNumber obj = new LargestPalindromicNumber();
        System.out.println(obj.largestPalindromic("444947137"));
        System.out.println(obj.largestPalindromic("00009"));
        System.out.println(obj.largestPalindromic("12321"));
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the length of the input string. We make one pass to count frequencies and then a fixed number `10` passes to build the result.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), as we use a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size (frequency array and some string builders).

By following this structured approach, we ensure that we efficiently find the largest palindromic number that can be formed from the given digits.
