[Leetcode 2119. A Number After a Double Reversal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2119)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer `num`, return `true` if `num` can be transformed into `num` after two reversals, else return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of the integer `num`?
   - The problem constraint usually indicates that `num` can be any integer within typical bounds for such problems (e.g., within the range of a 32-bit signed integer: -2^31 to 2^31-1).
2. How should we handle negative numbers?
   - This problem likely only concerns non-negative integers, but it's important to confirm any expectations regarding input limits and types.
3. Can `num` be zero?
   - Yes, and in that case, zero should return `true` because "00" after reversal is still "0".

### Strategy
The double reversal operation consists of:
1. Converting the number to a string and reversing it.
2. Reversing the string again and converting it back to an integer.

From practical observation:
- If `num` does not contain trailing zeroes, double reversal will return the original number.
- If `num` has trailing zeroes, double reversal will remove these trailing zeroes causing the number to change.

In essence:
- Any number with no trailing zero or the number `0` itself will remain the same after two reversals.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean isSameAfterReversals(int num) {
        // A number without trailing zeros or is zero itself remains unchanged after double reversal
        return num == 0 || num % 10 != 0;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The computation uses basic modulus operation which is constant time operation.
- Therefore, the time complexity of the solution is **O(1)**.

### Explanation
1. **num == 0**: Special case handled separately, returns `true` since 0 remains 0 after any number of reversals.
2. **num % 10 != 0**: If the last digit of `num` is non-zero, `num` doesn't have trailing zeros and remains unchanged post double reversal.

Any number having trailing zeroes will fail this condition and return `false`. This assures that any potential input is handled efficiently and correctly.
