[Leetcode 2333. Minimum Sum of Squared Difference](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2333)
### Problem Statement

Given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of equal length `n` and integers `k1` and `k2`, we need to minimize the sum of squared differences between corresponding elements in `nums1` and `nums2` after modifying at most `k1` elements in `nums1` and `k2` elements in `nums2`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the values of elements in `nums1` and `nums2`?**
   - No specific constraints were mentioned, so assume they can be any integer values.
   
2. **Are `k1` and `k2` such that the total modifications (`k1 + k2`) can always fully mitigate the differences?**
   - We need to assume that the modifications are carried in the most efficient way possible to minimize the sum of squared differences.

3. **Can we assume that `k1` and `k2` are non-negative integers?**
   - Yes, non-negative integers.

### Strategy

1. **Calculate the Differences**: First, calculate the absolute differences between corresponding elements in `nums1` and `nums2`.
  
2. **Maximize Reductions**: Use a max-heap to keep track of the largest differences and reduce those first, as reducing larger differences will have a greater impact on the sum of squared differences.

3. **Modify Elements**: Since we are allowed `k1` modifications in `nums1` and `k2` modifications in `nums2`, we will perform a total of `k1 + k2` modifications. Adjust the largest differences iteratively using a max-heap.

4. **Recompute the Minimum Sum**: Finally, after performing all possible modifications, compute the sum of squared differences.

### Code

Here is the Java implementation of the solution:

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public class MinimumSumOfSquaredDifference {
    public long minSumSquareDiff(int[] nums1, int[] nums2, int k1, int k2) {
        int n = nums1.length;
        int[] diff = new int[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            diff[i] = Math.abs(nums1[i] - nums2[i]);
        }
        
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b - a);
        for (int d : diff) {
            if (d > 0) {
                maxHeap.add(d);
            }
        }
        
        int totalChanges = k1 + k2;
        
        while (totalChanges > 0 && !maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
            int largest = maxHeap.poll();
            if (largest == 0) {
                break;
            }
            largest--;
            maxHeap.add(largest);
            totalChanges--;
        }
        
        long sumSquareDiff = 0;
        while (!maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
            int d = maxHeap.poll();
            sumSquareDiff += (long) d * d;
        }
        
        return sumSquareDiff;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumSumOfSquaredDifference solver = new MinimumSumOfSquaredDifference();
        int[] nums1 = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        int[] nums2 = {2, 10, 20, 19};
        int k1 = 10, k2 = 5;
        long result = solver.minSumSquareDiff(nums1, nums2, k1, k2);
        System.out.println(result);  // Expected output: 0 or minimized value
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Heap Operations**: Inserting and extracting from the heap takes `O(log n)`. 
- **Loop Operation**: We perform this operation `k1 + k2` times.

Hence, the overall time complexity is `O((k1 + k2) log n)`, where `n` is the length of the input arrays.

This should be efficient for reasonably sized inputs. Make sure that `k1 + k2` is not excessively large compared to `n` to avoid performance issues.
