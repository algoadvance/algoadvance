[Leetcode 2433. Find The Original Array of Prefix Xor](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2433)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `pref` of size `n`. You need to find and return the array `arr` of size `n` such that:

- `arr[0] = pref[0]`
- `arr[1]` is such that `arr[0] XOR arr[1] = pref[1]`
- `arr[2]` is such that `arr[0] XOR arr[1] XOR arr[2] = pref[2]`
- and so on...

In general, `arr[i]` is such that `arr[0] XOR arr[1] XOR ... XOR arr[i] = pref[i]`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the elements of `pref` be negative?
   - No, XOR operations are generally defined for non-negative integers.
   
2. What happens if `pref` is empty?
   - The size `n` of `pref` is guaranteed to be at least 1, so this scenario does not need to be considered.

## Strategy

Given the `pref` array, we need to reconstruct the `arr` array. This can be achieved using the following observations:

1. The first element of `arr` would be the same as the first element of `pref`, i.e., `arr[0] = pref[0]`.

2. For any subsequent element `i` in `arr`, to satisfy the condition:
   - `arr[0] XOR arr[1] XOR ... XOR arr[i] = pref[i]`
   - We can deduce `arr[i]` using the property of XOR, which states `a XOR b = c` if and only if `b = a XOR c`.

Thus, for each `i > 0`, we compute:
- `arr[i] = pref[i] XOR pref[i-1]`

## Code

Here's how we can implement this strategy in Java:

```java
public class OriginalArrayFromPrefixXOR {
    public int[] findArray(int[] pref) {
        int n = pref.length;
        int[] arr = new int[n];
        arr[0] = pref[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i] = pref[i] ^ pref[i - 1];
        }
        
        return arr;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OriginalArrayFromPrefixXOR solution = new OriginalArrayFromPrefixXOR();
        int[] pref = {5, 2, 0, 3, 1};
        int[] result = solution.findArray(pref);
        for (int num : result) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

## Explanation

1. Initialize the result array `arr` with the same length as `pref`.
2. Set `arr[0]` to `pref[0]`.
3. Use a loop starting from index 1 to n-1 to compute each `arr[i]` as `pref[i] XOR pref[i-1]`.
4. Return the resultant array `arr`.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where `n` is the length of the input array `pref`. This is because we are making a single pass through the array. The space complexity is also O(n) for storing the result array.
