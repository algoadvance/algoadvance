[Leetcode 2100. Find Good Days to Rob the Bank](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2100)
### Problem Statement:

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `security` where `security[i]` is the number of guards on duty on the `i`-th day. You are also given an integer `time`.

The `i`-th day is a good day to rob the bank if:

- There are at least `time` days before and after `i`.
- The number of guards on duty each day for the `time` days before `i` are non-increasing.
- The number of guards on duty each day for the `time` days after `i` are non-decreasing.

Return a list of all days (0-indexed) that are good days to rob the bank. The order of the result matters, and the returned list needs to be ascending.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. What are the constraints on the `security` array?
2. What should we do if the `security` array length is less than `2 * time + 1`?
3. Will the elements in `security` always be positive integers?

#### Clarifications based on typical LeetCode problems:
- `1 <= security.length <= 100,000`
- `0 <= security[i] <= 1,000,000`
- `1 <= time <= 1,000`

### Strategy:

1. **Precompute Arrays**:
    - Create a `decrease` array where `decrease[i]` is the count of consecutive non-increasing elements up to day `i`.
    - Create an `increase` array where `increase[i]` is the count of consecutive non-decreasing elements starting from day `i`.

2. **Iterate to Find Good Days**:
    - Iterate through the days and check for each day if both the `decrease` and `increase` conditions meet the `time` length requirement.
   
#### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Decrease Array**:
    - Iterate from left to right to fill the `decrease` array such that `decrease[i] = decrease[i-1] + 1` if `security[i-1] >= security[i]`, and `1` otherwise.

2. **Increase Array**:
    - Iterate from right to left to fill the `increase` array such that `increase[i] = increase[i+1] + 1` if `security[i] <= security[i+1]`, and `1` otherwise.

3. **Check for Good Days**:
    - For each day `i` from `time` to `security.length - time - 1`, check if `decrease[i] >= time + 1` and `increase[i] >= time + 1`. If both conditions are met, it's a good day.

### Code:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> goodDaysToRobBank(int[] security, int time) {
        int n = security.length;
        List<Integer> goodDays = new ArrayList<>();
        
        if (n < 2 * time + 1) {
            return goodDays; // Early return if insufficient length
        }
        
        int[] decrease = new int[n];
        int[] increase = new int[n];
        
        // Fill the decrease array
        decrease[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (security[i] <= security[i - 1]) {
                decrease[i] = decrease[i - 1] + 1;
            } else {
                decrease[i] = 1;
            }
        }
        
        // Fill the increase array
        increase[n - 1] = 1;
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (security[i] <= security[i + 1]) {
                increase[i] = increase[i + 1] + 1;
            } else {
                increase[i] = 1;
            }
        }
        
        // Find all good days
        for (int i = time; i < n - time; i++) {
            if (decrease[i] >= time + 1 && increase[i] >= time + 1) {
                goodDays.add(i);
            }
        }
        
        return goodDays;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **O(n)** for filling the `decrease` array.
- **O(n)** for filling the `increase` array.
- **O(n)** for checking each day to see if it is a good day.
- The overall time complexity is **O(n)**.
