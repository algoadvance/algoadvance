[Leetcode 3136. Valid Word](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3136)
## Problem Statement:
Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return the smallest string `word` such that:

1. `word1` is a subsequence of `word`.
2. `word2` is a subsequence of `word`.
3. `word` is the smallest string that satisfies the above conditions. If there are multiple valid strings, return the lexicographically smallest one.

**Note:**
- A string `s` is a subsequence of string `t` if deleting some characters from `t` (possibly none) makes `s`.
- Both strings consist of lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. *What should be done if `word1` and `word2` are either empty strings?*
   - If either string is empty, the smallest valid `word` should be the non-empty string.
   
2. *Are there constraints on the length of `word1` and `word2`?*
   - Typically, this kind of problem implies reasonable constraints such as `1 ≤ len(word1), len(word2) ≤ 1000`.

3. *Can both word1 and word2 be the same string?*
   - Yes. If they are same, the smallest valid string would be either of them, as they are identical subsequences of the final answer.

## Strategy:

To address this problem, we need to determine a common supersequence. The strategy revolves around finding the shortest common supersequence (SCS) of the two strings `word1` and `word2`.

### Steps:

1. **Compute the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS)**: 
   - The LCS can help in identifying the minimum length supersequence by recognizing the common subsequence.

2. **Construct the Supersequence based on LCS**:
   - Using the LCS, construct the supersequence by merging `word1` and `word2`.
   - Insert the characters from `word1` and `word2` while aligning with the LCS, ensuring the result is lexicographically smallest.

### Code:

```java
public class ValidWordOut {
    
    public static String smallestSupersequence(String word1, String word2) {
        int n = word1.length();
        int b = word2.length();

        // Compute the LCS dynamic programming table
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][b + 1];
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= b; j++) {
                if (word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Build the shortest supersequence by tracking back from dp table
        StringBuilder supersequence = new StringBuilder();
        int i = n, j = b;
        
        while (i > 0 && j > 0) {
            if (word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                // Part of both sequences
                supersequence.append(word1.charAt(i - 1));
                i--;
                j--;
            } else if (dp[i - 1][j] >= dp[i][j - 1]) {
                supersequence.append(word1.charAt(i - 1));
                i--;
            } else {
                supersequence.append(word2.charAt(j - 1));
                j--;
            }
        }
        
        // Append remaining characters of word1 or word2
        while (i > 0) {
            supersequence.append(word1.charAt(i - 1));
            i--;
        }
        
        while (j > 0) {
            supersequence.append(word2.charAt(j - 1));
            j--;
        }
        
        // Reverse the built string as we constructed it from end
        return supersequence.reverse().toString();
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String word1 = "abac";
        String word2 = "cab";
        System.out.println(smallestSupersequence(word1, word2)); // Output: "cabac"
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:
- **LCS computation (DP Table Building)**: O(n × m), where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `word1` and `word2`.
- **Supersequence construction**: O(n + m), because we traverse through both lengths once each.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the approach is **O(n × m)**.
