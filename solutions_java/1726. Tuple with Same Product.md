[Leetcode 1726. Tuple with Same Product](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1726)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of distinct positive integers, return the number of tuples `(a, b, c, d)` such that `a * b = c * d` where `a`, `b`, `c`, and `d` are elements of `nums`, and `a != b != c != d`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the maximum size of `nums`?
   - Typical constraint: `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`.
  
2. **Element Range**: What is the range of the elements in `nums`?
   - Typical constraint: `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`.

3. **Output**: Should we count distinct tuples or all valid tuples? 
   - All valid tuples including permutations, as the problem specifies tuples without any order constraints.

4. **Duplicates**: Should we consider duplicates in `nums`?
   - The problem specifies `distinct positive integers`, so no duplicates.

### Strategy

1. **Pair Products Calculation**: First, we compute all possible pairs `(a, b)` and calculate their products. We use a hashmap to store these products as keys and their corresponding pair(s) as values.

2. **Count Tuples**: For any product that appears more than once in the hashmap:
   - If a product is mapped to multiple pairs, count how many different tuples can be formed.
   - Specifically, for a product appearing `k` times, the number of tuples is `k * (k-1) / 2`, each representing a unique combination of 4 elements.

3. **Tuple Calculation**: For each valid product, compute the count of valid tuples using combinatorial counting (since `(a, b)` and `(b, a)` are the same for product calculation but are distinct for tuple formation).

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int tupleSameProduct(int[] nums) {
        Map<Integer, List<int[]>> productMap = new HashMap<>();

        // Step 1: Calculate all pair products and fill the hashmap
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
                int product = nums[i] * nums[j];
                productMap
                    .computeIfAbsent(product, k -> new ArrayList<>())
                    .add(new int[]{nums[i], nums[j]});
            }
        }

        int result = 0;

        // Step 2: Count the number of valid tuples
        for (List<int[]> pairs : productMap.values()) {
            int n = pairs.size();
            if (n > 1) {
                result += n * (n - 1) * 4;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 12}; // Example input
        System.out.println(sol.tupleSameProduct(nums)); // Example usage
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Pair Generation**: \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `nums` array. This is due to the nested loops generating all pairs.
- **Tuple Calculation**: \(O(n^2)\) in the worst case scenario, as we may need to process each pair list for the product map.

Given the constraints and the operations, the overall time complexity of the solution is \(O(n^2)\), which is efficient and feasible for \(n\) up to 1000.
