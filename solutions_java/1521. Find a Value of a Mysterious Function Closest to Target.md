[Leetcode 1521. Find a Value of a Mysterious Function Closest to Target](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1521)
### Problem Statement

We are given an integer array `arr` and an integer `target`. The task is to find the value of a mysterious function `f(arr, i, j)` which is closest to the `target`. The function `f(arr, i, j)` is defined as follows:

- `f(arr, i, j)` = arr[i] & arr[i + 1] & ... & arr[j] (where & denotes the bitwise AND operation)

Your goal is to find and return the value of `f(arr, i, j)` (with 0 <= i <= j < arr.length) that is closest to the `target`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of the input values**: What are the range and constraints for the elements in the array and the target value?
2. **Array Length**: Is there a minimum or maximum length for the array?
3. **Exact vs Closest Match**: If there are two values that are equally close to the target, is there any preference for the result?

### Code

Here's the Java code to solve the problem:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int closestToTarget(int[] arr, int target) {
        // Initialize the result with a large number
        int result = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        // List to maintain current possible AND results
        HashSet<Integer> possible = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (int num : arr) {
            // Temporary set for the current iteration
            HashSet<Integer> currentSet = new HashSet<>();
            
            // Add the current number to the set
            currentSet.add(num);
            
            // Update all numbers in the possible set with AND operation with current number
            for (int p : possible) {
                currentSet.add(p & num);
            }
            
            // Update the possible set to the newly calculated values
            possible = currentSet;
            
            // Calculate and update the result with the closest value to the target so far
            for (int val : possible) {
                result = Math.min(result, Math.abs(val - target));
            }
        }
        
        // Return the closest value to the target
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Strategy

The problem involves finding the subarray whose bitwise AND result is closest to the target value. Given that computing all possible subarrays AND from scratch can be very inefficient, we can employ a dynamic programming-like approach using a HashSet to store intermediate results.

1. **Initialize Required Variables**: Start with a variable `result` that holds the closest value found so far, initializing it to a large number (`Integer.MAX_VALUE`).
2. **Iterate Through Array**: For each element in the array, we use a temporary set to store all possible AND results for subarrays ending at that element.
3. **Update Intermediate Values**: For each value in the set, calculate its AND with the current element and update the set.
4. **Update Result**: Continuously update the closest value to the target by checking the difference between each AND result and the target.
5. **Return the Closest Value**: Finally, return the result which holds the closest value to the target.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(n * k), where `n` is the length of the array and `k` represents the number of unique intermediate AND values we are storing. In the worst case, `k` can be bounded by the bit length of integers (e.g., 32 for typical integers), though practical performance may be better due to constraints on values.

This approach ensures that we don't have to compute subarray ANDs from scratch repeatedly, making it significantly efficient than a naive O(n^2) or O(n^3) approach.
