[Leetcode 1824. Minimum Sideway Jumps](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1824)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array obstacles of length n, where obstacles[i] (1-indexed) is the lane in which there is an obstacle on the road at position i. If obstacles[i] == 0, there are no obstacles at position i. There are three lanes numbered from 1 to 3. You are currently in the second lane and want to reach the end of the road as quickly as possible (with the minimum number of side jumps).

Return the minimum number of side jumps needed to reach the end of the road.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Length**: What is the maximum length of the 'obstacles' array?
   - Note: Typical constraints for such problems are up to \(10^5\).

2. **Obstacle Position**: Can there be successive obstacles in the same position across different lanes, or will there always be a possible lane to jump to?
   - Assume there will always be at least one lane without obstacles at every position.

3. **Restrictions**: Are there any specific restrictions or special cases to handle (like starting or ending with obstacles)?
   - You cannot start where there is an obstacle in the second lane (obstacles[0] should be 0).

4. **Output**: The function should return the minimum number of sideway jumps needed.

### Strategy
1. **Initialization**: Create a dynamic programming table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum jumps needed to reach position `i` in lane `j`.
2. **Base Case**: Start at the initial position 0 in the second lane.
3. **Transition**: For each position, if there are no obstacles in the current lane, carry over the value from the previous position. If there is an obstacle, compute the minimum jumps required by changing lanes.
4. **Final Computation**: Compute the minimum number of jumps to reach the end of the lane.

### Code

```java
public class MinimumSidewayJumps {
    public int minSideJumps(int[] obstacles) {
        int n = obstacles.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n][3];
        
        // Initialize the starting position
        dp[0][0] = 1; // first lane starts with 1 jump (to shift initially)
        dp[0][1] = 0; // second lane starts with 0 jump
        dp[0][2] = 1; // third lane starts with 1 jump
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // Initialize with a large number
                if (obstacles[i] != j + 1) {
                    // If there is no obstacle in the current lane at the current position
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]; // Carry over from previous position in the same lane
                }
            }
            for (int j = 0; j < 3; j++) {
                if (obstacles[i] != j + 1) {
                    // Check the minimum jumps required by jumping from other lanes
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], Math.min(dp[i][(j + 1) % 3], dp[i][(j + 2) % 3]) + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // The answer is the minimum jumps required in the last position among all lanes
        return Math.min(dp[n - 1][0], Math.min(dp[n - 1][1], dp[n - 1][2]));
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the obstacles array since we iterate over the array once and perform constant-time operations for each element.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) due to the auxiliary space used by the `dp` array.

This solution efficiently minimizes the number of sideway jumps needed to traverse the path given the obstacles array.
