[Leetcode 3147. Taking Maximum Energy From the Mystic Dungeon](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3147)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `energy` where `energy[i][j]` represents the energy at cell (i, j) in a dungeon grid. A knight is entering the dungeon at cell (0, 0) and trying to reach the bottom-right corner of the grid at cell (m-1, n-1). The knight can only move right or down, and collects the energy from any cell he enters. You need to write a function that computes the maximum energy the knight can collect on his way to the bottom-right corner.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of dimensions for the grid `energy`? 
   - Are there any energy values constraints (negative or non-integer values)?
   - What should the function return if the grid is empty?

2. **Output:**
   - Should the function return just the maximum energy value collected or also the path taken?

### Assumptions

1. The dimensions of the grid `energy` will be at least 1x1.
2. All values in `energy` are non-negative integers.
3. The function will return only the maximum energy value collected.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming:
- Create a 2D DP array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum energy collected up to cell (i, j).
- Initialize `dp[0][0]` with `energy[0][0]` since that's where the knight starts.
- Fill in the first row and first column separately because they have only one possible way to be reached (either from the left for the first row or from above for the first column).
- For the rest of the cells, use the recurrence relation:
  - `dp[i][j] = energy[i][j] + max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`, which means the knight can either come from the top cell or from the left cell.
- The answer will be found in `dp[m-1][n-1]` where `m` and `n` are the dimensions of the grid.

### Code

```java
public class MysticDungeon {
    public int maximumEnergy(int[][] energy) {
        if (energy == null || energy.length == 0 || energy[0].length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        int m = energy.length;
        int n = energy[0].length;
        int[][] dp = new int[m][n];
        
        dp[0][0] = energy[0][0];
        
        // Initialize the first row
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + energy[0][j];
        }
        
        // Initialize the first column
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + energy[i][0];
        }
        
        // Fill the rest of the dp array
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = energy[i][j] + Math.max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
            }
        }
        
        return dp[m-1][n-1];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MysticDungeon dungeon = new MysticDungeon();
        int[][] energy = {
            {5, 3, 2},
            {1, 7, 1},
            {4, 6, 8}
        };
        System.out.println(dungeon.maximumEnergy(energy)); // Should output 26
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(m * n) because we are filling up an `m x n` grid once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m * n) due to the usage of additional DP array. 

If space optimization is desired, the solution could be improved by using two 1D arrays instead of a 2D array, but the time complexity would remain the same.
