[Leetcode 312. Burst Balloons](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l312)
### Problem Statement

You are given `n` balloons, indexed from `0` to `n-1`. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an array `nums`. You are asked to burst all the balloons. If you burst the `i`-th balloon, you will get `nums[left] * nums[i] * nums[right]` coins. Here `left` and `right` are the adjacent indices of `i`. After the burst, the left and right then become adjacent.

Find the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.

**Note:**

- You may assume `nums[-1] = nums[n] = 1`. They are not real balloons, therefore you can't burst them.
- `1 <= n <= 500`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`

### Clarifying Questions

1. What should be done if the `nums` array is empty?
   - Since `1 <= n`, this situation will not occur per constraints.
   
2. Are the elements in `nums` always non-negative?
   - Yes, `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`.

3. Should the solution handle cases where all elements are zeroes?
   - Yes, but bursting zero-valued balloons yields `0` coins.

4. Can I use additional space, and if so, how much?
   - Yes, you can use additional space. The constraint ensures that the solution should be efficient both in time and space.

### Strategy

This problem can be approached using Dynamic Programming (DP). The idea is to think of the problem in terms of subproblems and solve it in a bottom-up manner.

#### Steps

1. **Define a DP Table:**
   - Let `dp[i][j]` represent the maximum coins that can be obtained by bursting the balloons between indices `i` and `j` (exclusive).

2. **Transform the original problem:**
   - We'll add two virtual balloons with value `1` at both ends of the `nums` array for simplification. This makes the `nums` array include `1` at the beginning and the end.

3. **Iterate over possible balloons to burst:**
   - For each subarray defined by the range `[left, right]`, we'll consider every possible balloon `k` within this range as the last balloon to burst. The value of bursting balloon `k` last would be `nums[left] * nums[k] * nums[right]`.

4. **Formula:**
   - `dp[left][right] = max(dp[left][right], dp[left][k] + nums[left] * nums[k] * nums[right] + dp[k][right])`

5. **Initialization:**
   - The DP table should be initialized to handle subarrays of increasing length.

6. **Return Result:**
   - The answer will be `dp[0][n+1]` which represents the maximum coins obtained by bursting all balloons.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxCoins(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] extendedNums = new int[n + 2];
        extendedNums[0] = 1;
        extendedNums[n + 1] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            extendedNums[i] = nums[i - 1];
        }

        int[][] dp = new int[n + 2][n + 2];

        for (int length = 1; length <= n; length++) {
            for (int left = 1; left <= n - length + 1; left++) {
                int right = left + length - 1;
                for (int k = left; k <= right; k++) {
                    dp[left][right] = Math.max(dp[left][right], 
                       dp[left][k - 1] + extendedNums[left - 1] * extendedNums[k] * extendedNums[right + 1] + dp[k + 1][right]);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[1][n];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n^3). We have three nested loops, where each runs up to `n` causing a cubic time complexity.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n^2). We use a 2D DP array of size `(n+2) x (n+2)`.

This approach should work efficiently within the problem's constraints.
