[Leetcode 1161. Maximum Level Sum of a Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1161)
### Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, the task is to find the level of the tree with the maximum sum. The level of the root is 1.

### Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Use a BFS approach to traverse each level of the tree. This ensures that we can process all nodes in a level before moving on to the next.
2. **Level Sum Calculation**: For each level, calculate the sum of the node values.
3. **Tracking Maximum Sum**: Maintain a record of the maximum sum encountered and the corresponding level.
4. **Edge Cases**: An edge case to consider is an empty tree, which should return level 0 or some indication of no levels.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the values of the nodes?** No, we assume that the node values can be any integer (positive, negative, or zero).
2. **Can the tree be empty?** Yes, if the tree is empty, the root will be `null`.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Queue;
import java.util.LinkedList;

class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode() {}
    TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
    TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

public class Solution {
    public int maxLevelSum(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return 0;
        }

        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(root);
        int maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int maxLevel = 1;
        int currentLevel = 1;

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int levelSize = queue.size();
            int currentSum = 0;

            for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
                TreeNode currentNode = queue.poll();
                currentSum += currentNode.val;

                if (currentNode.left != null) {
                    queue.offer(currentNode.left);
                }
                if (currentNode.right != null) {
                    queue.offer(currentNode.right);
                }
            }

            if (currentSum > maxSum) {
                maxSum = currentSum;
                maxLevel = currentLevel;
            }

            currentLevel++;
        }

        return maxLevel;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Since each node is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(M), where M is the maximum number of nodes at any level. This is due to the space required for the queue, which can hold up to a maximum of M nodes at any time.

This solution provides a clear and efficient way to find the level of the binary tree with the maximum sum using a BFS traversal.
