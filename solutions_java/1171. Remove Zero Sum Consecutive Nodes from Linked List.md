[Leetcode 1171. Remove Zero Sum Consecutive Nodes from Linked List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1171)
### Problem Statement
Given the head of a linked list, we want to remove all consecutive nodes that sum to zero. After removing these nodes, we return the modified linked list.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be returned if all nodes are removed?**
   - Return `null`.
   
2. **Can the input linked list have negative values?**
   - Yes, the linked list can have negative, positive, and zero values.

3. **What is the expected time complexity?**
   - An optimal solution should work in linear time complexity, O(n).

4. **Will the final list still be a linked list?**
   - Yes, it should remain a linked list.

### Strategy
1. **Prefix Sum with HashMap**: We'll use the prefix sum approach combined with a hashmap. The key idea is to maintain a running sum of the node values as we traverse the linked list.
2. **Check for Prefix Sum**: As we compute the running sum, we store the sum and corresponding node in a hashmap. If the same running sum appears again, this indicates that the section of the list between the two appearances of this sum (inclusive) sums to zero and can be removed.
3. **Remove Zero Sum Segments**:
   - Traverse the list while maintaining the prefix sum.
   - Use the hashmap to detect if the current prefix sum has been seen before; if so, remove the nodes from the list that constitute the zero-sum segment.

### Code
```java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
}

public class Solution {
    public ListNode removeZeroSumSublists(ListNode head) {
        // Dummy node to handle edge cases like starting with a 0-sum sequence.
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;
        
        // HashMap to store the prefix sum and corresponding node.
        Map<Integer, ListNode> prefixSumMap = new HashMap<>();
        int prefixSum = 0;
        ListNode current = dummy;
        
        // First pass to get the prefix sum and their node positions
        while (current != null) {
            prefixSum += current.val;
            prefixSumMap.put(prefixSum, current);
            current = current.next;
        }
        
        // Second pass to remove zero sum sequences.
        current = dummy;
        prefixSum = 0;
        while (current != null) {
            prefixSum += current.val;
            if (prefixSumMap.containsKey(prefixSum)) {
                // Jump over the zero-sum sequence
                current.next = prefixSumMap.get(prefixSum).next;
            }
            current = current.next;
        }
        
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because we perform two linear passes over the list, and hash map operations (insert and get) are O(1) on average.
- **First pass**: Traverses the list to calculate the prefix sums. O(n)
- **Second pass**: Traverses the list again to remove the zero-sum subsequences. O(n)

Therefore, the total time complexity is O(n). The space complexity is also O(n) due to the storage of prefix sums in the hash map.
