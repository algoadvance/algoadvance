[Leetcode 834. Sum of Distances in Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l834)
## Problem Statement:
Given an undirected tree consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n-1`, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [u, v]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `u` and `v` in the tree, return an array `answer` of length `n` where `answer[i]` is the sum of the distances between node `i` and all other nodes in the tree.

### Example:
```
Input: n = 6, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[2,3],[2,4],[2,5]]
Output: [8,12,6,10,10,10]
Explanation: The sum of distances from 0 to all nodes is 2 + 1 + 2 + 3 + 3 = 11.
```

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Can there be multiple edges between the same pair of nodes?
   - No, per the definition of a tree, there is exactly one unique path between any two nodes.
2. Can the tree be disconnected?
   - No, by definition, a tree is a connected acyclic graph.
3. What constraints can we expect on `n`?
   - The problem constraints would typically be `1 <= n <= 10^4`, ensuring efficient solutions are necessary.

## Strategy:
1. We will use DFS (Depth-First Search) twice.
   - First DFS to calculate the count of nodes in each subtree and the sum of distances within each subtree.
   - Second DFS to use the values from the first DFS to calculate the required distances.
2. Construct an adjacency list to represent the tree.
3. Utilize two arrays: `count` to maintain the number of nodes in the subtree of each node, and `answer` to maintain the sum of distances.

### Detailed Steps:
1. Construct the adjacency list from the `edges`.
2. Perform the first DFS from the root node (e.g., node `0`):
   - Compute `count[node]` which is the size of the subtree rooted at `node`.
   - Compute the `answer[node]` as the sum of distances within the subtree rooted at `node`.
3. Perform the second DFS to compute the result for each node:
   - Use parent node values to compute results for each child node by adjusting the known sum of distances.

## Code Implementation:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class SumOfDistancesInTree {
    
    public int[] sumOfDistancesInTree(int n, int[][] edges) {
        List<Set<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i)
            graph.add(new HashSet<>());
        for (int[] e : edges) {
            graph.get(e[0]).add(e[1]);
            graph.get(e[1]).add(e[0]);
        }
        
        int[] count = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(count, 1);  // Each node is initially a single count by itself.
        int[] answer = new int[n];
        
        dfs(0, -1, graph, count, answer);
        dfs2(0, -1, graph, count, answer, n);
        
        return answer;
    }
    
    private void dfs(int node, int parent, List<Set<Integer>> graph, int[] count, int[] answer) {
        for (int neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
            if (neighbor == parent) continue;
            dfs(neighbor, node, graph, count, answer);
            count[node] += count[neighbor];
            answer[node] += answer[neighbor] + count[neighbor];
        }
    }
    
    private void dfs2(int node, int parent, List<Set<Integer>> graph, int[] count, int[] answer, int n) {
        for (int neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
            if (neighbor == parent) continue;
            answer[neighbor] = answer[node] - count[neighbor] + (n - count[neighbor]);
            dfs2(neighbor, node, graph, count, answer, n);
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SumOfDistancesInTree solution = new SumOfDistancesInTree();
        
        // Test case 1
        int n = 6;
        int[][] edges = // use example from above
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(solution.sumOfDistancesInTree(n, edges)));  // Output should be [8, 12, 6, 10, 10, 10]
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:
- Constructing the adjacency list: O(n)
- First DFS traversal: O(n)
- Second DFS traversal: O(n)
- Overall time complexity: O(n)

This efficient approach ensures that we can handle the upper constraint limit of `n` effectively, providing results promptly.
