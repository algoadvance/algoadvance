[Leetcode 1019. Next Greater Node In Linked List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1019)
### Problem Statement

You are given the head of a linked list with `N` nodes.

For each node in the list, find the value of the next greater node. The next greater node of a node `i` is the node `j` whose value is greater than node `i`'s value; `i` is before `j` in the linked list.

Return an array of integers `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the value of the next greater node of the `i-th` node (1-indexed). If such a node does not exist, set `answer[i]` to 0.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input format:**
    - What is the range of values for each node?
    - Are there any constraints on the size of the linked list?
2. **Output format:**
    - Should the output be a list of integers where each integer corresponds to the next greater node's value in the linked list?

### Example

```plaintext
Input: head = [2,1,5]
Output: [5,5,0]

Input: head = [2,7,4,3,5]
Output: [7,0,5,5,0]
```

### Strategy

1. Create an array to store results. The length of the array will be the same as the length of the linked list.
2. Traverse the linked list to fill the array with values of the nodes.
3. Use a stack to keep track of the indices of the nodes for which we have not yet found the next greater value.
4. Traverse the array of node values:
    - For each node value, while there are indices in the stack and the current node value is greater than the value at those indices, update the result for those indices and pop them from the stack.
    - Push the index of the current node value into the stack.
5. Any index left in the stack at the end of the traversal will have a corresponding value of 0 in the result.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int[] nextLargerNodes(ListNode head) {
        List<Integer> values = new ArrayList<>();
        // Extract all values from the linked list
        while (head != null) {
            values.add(head.val);
            head = head.next;
        }

        int[] result = new int[values.size()];
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < values.size(); i++) {
            // Process the current node value
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && values.get(stack.peek()) < values.get(i)) {
                result[stack.pop()] = values.get(i);
            }
            stack.push(i);
        }

        // Remaining indices in the stack will have 0 in result
        return result;
    }
}

class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode(int x) {
        val = x;
        next = null;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. The reason is that each node is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(N), both for the `values` list to store the node values and the `result` array as well as the stack used to keep track of indices.
