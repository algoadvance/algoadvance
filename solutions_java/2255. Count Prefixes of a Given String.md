[Leetcode 2255. Count Prefixes of a Given String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2255)
### Problem Statement
You are given a list of strings `words` and a string `s`. A string is called a prefix of `s` if it can be obtained by removing some (possibly zero) characters from the end of `s`.

Return the number of strings in `words` that are prefixes of `s`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size**: What are the constraints on the number of strings in the list `words` and the length of the string `s`?
   - Assume there can be up to 1000 strings in `words`, and the length of each string and `s` could be up to 1000 characters.

2. **Characters**: Are the strings composed of only lowercase English letters?
   - Yes, the strings will only contain lowercase English letters.

3. **Prefix Definition**: Is the prefix definition straightforward?
   - Yes, a prefix of `s` means it matches the first part of `s` exactly.

### Strategy
1. **Initialization**: Initialize a counter to zero to count the number of valid prefix strings in `words`.

2. **Loop Through `words`**: Iterate over each string in `words`.

3. **Check Prefix**: For each string, check if it is a prefix of `s` by using the `startsWith` method in Java.

4. **Update Counter**: If it is a prefix, increment the counter.

5. **Return the Counter**: Once all strings in `words` are checked, return the counter as the result.

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int countPrefixes(String[] words, String s) {
        int count = 0;
        
        for (String word : words) {
            if (s.startsWith(word)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization**: O(1)
- **Loop Through `words`**: O(n) where `n` is the number of strings in `words`.
- **Check Prefix**: The `startsWith` method is O(m) where `m` is the length of the prefix being checked.
- **Overall Complexity**: O(n * m) where:
  - `n` is the number of strings in `words`
  - `m` is the average length of the strings

Given the constraints, this approach will be efficient and handle the maximum input sizes effectively.
