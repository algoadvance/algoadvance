[Leetcode 2389. Longest Subsequence With Limited Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2389)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer array `queries` of length `m`. For each query `queries[i]`, find out the maximum length of a subsequence of `nums` such that the sum of the subsequence is less than or equal to `queries[i]`. Return an array `answer` where `answer[i]` is the answer to the `i-th` query.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the definition of a subsequence?**
   - A subsequence is a sequence derived from another sequence by deleting some or none of the elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

2. **Is it necessary for subsequence elements to be contiguous?**
   - No, elements in the subsequence do not need to be contiguous.

3. **Can the elements in `nums` and `queries` be negative?**
   - No, it is guaranteed that all elements of `nums` and `queries` are non-negative integers.

4. **What are the possible lengths of `nums` and `queries`?**
   - The lengths `n` and `m` can be up to `1000`.

### Strategy

1. **Sort and Prefix Sum**:
   - First, sort the `nums` array.
   - Compute the prefix sum of the sorted `nums` array. The prefix sum at index `i` gives the sum of elements from the beginning up to `i-th` element.
   
2. **Binary Search**:
   - For each query, use binary search on the prefix sum array to quickly find the maximum length of subsequence whose sum is less than or equal to the query value.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class LongestSubsequenceWithLimitedSum {
    public int[] answerQueries(int[] nums, int[] queries) {
        // Sort the nums array
        Arrays.sort(nums);

        // Create a prefix sum array
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] prefixSum = new int[n];
        prefixSum[0] = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i - 1] + nums[i];
        }

        // Prepare the answer array
        int m = queries.length;
        int[] answer = new int[m];

        // For each query, find the maximum length using binary search
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            int query = queries[i];
            int left = 0, right = n - 1;

            // Binary search to find the rightmost position where prefix sum is <= query
            while (left <= right) {
                int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
                if (prefixSum[mid] <= query) {
                    left = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    right = mid - 1;
                }
            }

            // The length of the longest subsequence satisfying the condition
            // will be 'right + 1'
            answer[i] = right + 1;
        }

        return answer;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LongestSubsequenceWithLimitedSum sol = new LongestSubsequenceWithLimitedSum();
        int[] nums = {4,5,2,1};
        int[] queries = {3, 10, 21};
        int[] results = sol.answerQueries(nums, queries);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(results));  // Output: [2, 3, 4]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting `nums`**: \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Prefix sum computation**: \(O(n)\).
- **Binary search for each query**: \(O(m \log n)\) (since binary search per query is \(O(\log n)\) and there are \(m\) queries).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n + n + m \log n)\), which simplifies to \(O((n + m) \log n)\).
