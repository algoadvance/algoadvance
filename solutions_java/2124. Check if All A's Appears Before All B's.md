[Leetcode 2124. Check if All A's Appears Before All B's](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2124)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting of only the characters 'a' and 'b'. You need to determine if every 'a' in the string appears before every 'b'. Return `true` if every 'a' appears before every 'b', otherwise return `false`.

### Example 1:
- Input: s = "aaabbb"
- Output: true

### Example 2:
- Input: s = "abab"
- Output: false

### Example 3:
- Input: s = "bbb"
- Output: true

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Is the string guaranteed to be non-empty?
   - Should the solution be case-sensitive, or can we assume all characters will be lowercase?
   - What is the maximum length of the string?

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Should we return a boolean value?

## Strategy

- Iterate through the string.
- Maintain a flag variable that changes when a 'b' is encountered.
- If any 'a' is found after this flag is set to true, return false.
- If no such 'a' is found after encountering 'b', return true.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because we only make a single pass through the string.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean checkString(String s) {
        boolean foundB = false;
        
        // Iterate through each character in the string
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (ch == 'b') {
                foundB = true;
            }
            // If 'a' is found after 'b', return false
            if (foundB && ch == 'a') {
                return false;
            }
        }
        // If no 'a' is found after 'b', return true
        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();

        // Test cases
        System.out.println(sol.checkString("aaabbb")); // true
        System.out.println(sol.checkString("abab"));   // false
        System.out.println(sol.checkString("bbb"));    // true
        System.out.println(sol.checkString("a"));      // true
        System.out.println(sol.checkString(""));       // true (assuming empty is a valid input)
    }
}
```

### Explanation
- The `checkString` method initializes a boolean `foundB` to track if a 'b' has been encountered.
- It iterates through each character in the string.
- When a 'b' is found, `foundB` is set to true.
- If `foundB` is true and an 'a' is encountered, it returns false immediately.
- If the loop completes without finding an 'a' after a 'b', it returns true.

### Edge Cases Covered
- All 'a's in the string
- All 'b's in the string
- Mixed 'a's and 'b's with the wrong order
- Empty string

This straightforward approach ensures we efficiently check the condition by a single traversal of the string.
