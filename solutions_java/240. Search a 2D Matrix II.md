[Leetcode 240. Search a 2D Matrix II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l240)
### Problem Statement

Write an efficient algorithm to search for a value in an `m x n` matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
- Integers in each row are sorted in ascending order from left to right.
- Integers in each column are sorted in ascending order from top to bottom.

Given the matrix and a target value, return `true` if the target is found in the matrix, and `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**
```java
Input: matrix = [
  [1, 4, 7, 11, 15],
  [2, 5, 8, 12, 19],
  [3, 6, 9, 16, 22],
  [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
  [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
], target = 5
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```java
Input: matrix = [
  [1, 4, 7, 11, 15],
  [2, 5, 8, 12, 19],
  [3, 6, 9, 16, 22],
  [10, 13, 14, 17, 24],
  [18, 21, 23, 26, 30]
], target = 20
Output: false
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the values in the matrix?**
    - Values are integers and both the rows and the columns of the matrix are sorted in ascending order.

2. **What should be returned if the matrix is empty or dimensions are 0?**
    - If the matrix or its dimensions are empty, the function should return `false`.

3. **What is the expected size of the matrix?**
    - The matrix dimensions can be up to 300 x 300. 

### Strategy

To efficiently search the matrix, leverage its sorted properties:

- Start the search from the top-right corner.
- Compare the current element with the target:
  - If it's equal to the target, return `true`.
  - If it's smaller than the target, move down to the next row.
  - If it's larger than the target, move left to the previous column.
- Repeat until the element is found or the indices go out of bounds.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean searchMatrix(int[][] matrix, int target) {
        if (matrix == null || matrix.length == 0 || matrix[0].length == 0) {
            return false;
        }
        
        int rows = matrix.length;
        int cols = matrix[0].length;
        
        int row = 0;
        int col = cols - 1; // start from the top-right corner
        
        while (row < rows && col >= 0) {
            if (matrix[row][col] == target) {
                return true;
            } else if (matrix[row][col] > target) {
                col--; // move left
            } else {
                row++; // move down
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Best Case:** O(1) - if the target is found at the first position checked.
- **Average Case:** O(m + n) - where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.
- **Worst Case:** O(m + n) - if the algorithm exhaustively checks all the potential positions along the way to the bottom left corner.

### Space Complexity

- **Overall:** O(1) - The algorithm uses constant extra space.
