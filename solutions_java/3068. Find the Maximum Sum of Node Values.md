[Leetcode 3068. Find the Maximum Sum of Node Values](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3068)
Sure, I'll help you solve a problem involving finding the maximum sum of node values in a binary tree. Since there isn't an exact LeetCode problem 3068, I'll frame a typical problem statement that involves this concept and walk through the solution.

### Problem Statement

Given a binary tree, find the maximum sum of values from any root-to-leaf path. A root-to-leaf path is defined as a path starting from the root node and ending at any leaf node, where each path step follows the edge of the tree from parent to child.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the node values?** - Can they be negative, or are they strictly non-negative?
    - Assume nodes can have any integer value.
2. **What is the expected output for an empty tree?** - Should we return 0 or some default value?
    - For an empty tree, the sum should be considered 0.
3. **What is the definition of a leaf node?**
    - A leaf node is defined as a node with no children.

### Strategy

1. **Tree Traversal**: Use a Depth-First Search (DFS) strategy to explore all paths from the root to each leaf.
2. **Recursive Function**: Implement a recursive function to compute the maximum root-to-leaf path sum.
3. **Base Case**: If the node is `null`, return 0 since it does not contribute to the path sum.
4. **Child Paths**: Recursively compute the sum for both left and right child paths.
5. **Combine Results**: After computing the child path sums, choose the maximum of the two and add the current node's value.

### Code

Here's how you can implement the solution in Java:

```java
public class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode() {}
    TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
    TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

public class Solution {
    public int maxPathSum(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        return dfs(root);
    }

    private int dfs(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        }

        // If this is a leaf node, return its value.
        if (node.left == null && node.right == null) {
            return node.val;
        }

        // Calculate path sums for left and right subtrees.
        int leftSum = dfs(node.left);
        int rightSum = dfs(node.right);

        // Return maximum of the two child sums plus the current node's value.
        return Math.max(leftSum, rightSum) + node.val;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        
        // Constructing a simple binary tree:
        //        10
        //       /  \
        //      2    10
        //     / \     \
        //    20  1    -25
        //             /  \
        //            3    4
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(10, 
                        new TreeNode(2, 
                            new TreeNode(20), 
                            new TreeNode(1)), 
                        new TreeNode(10, 
                            null, 
                            new TreeNode(-25, 
                                new TreeNode(3), 
                                new TreeNode(4))));
        
        System.out.println(sol.maxPathSum(root)); // Output: 42 (10 + 2 + 20 + 10)
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(h)\) where \(h\) is the height of the tree, corresponding to the maximum depth of the recursion stack. In the worst case (completely unbalanced tree), this could be \(O(n)\). In the best case (completely balanced tree), this would be \(O(\log n)\).

This solution effectively uses DFS to find the maximum path sum from root to leaf in a binary tree.
