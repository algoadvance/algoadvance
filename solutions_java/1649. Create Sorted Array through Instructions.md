[Leetcode 1649. Create Sorted Array through Instructions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1649)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `instructions`, you are tasked with creating a sorted array from the elements in `instructions`. You start with an empty array `sortedArray` and, for each element from `instructions`, insert it into `sortedArray`. Additionally, you need to calculate the cost incurred for inserting each element into `sortedArray`:

The cost is the smaller of:
1. The number of elements strictly less than the element being inserted (let's call this `costLeft`).
2. The number of elements strictly greater than the element being inserted (let's call this `costRight`).

You need to return the total cost modulo `10^9 + 7` after processing all elements in `instructions`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can elements in `instructions` be negative?**
   - No, the elements in `instructions` are non-negative integers.

2. **What is the range of values in `instructions`?**
   - The values can be up to `10^5`.

3. **What is the length of `instructions`?**
   - The length can be up to `10^5`.

4. **What should be returned if `instructions` is empty?**
   - The total cost would be `0`.

5. **Should the cost be calculated for all elements including duplicates?**
   - Yes, every insertion from `instructions` should be processed, including duplicates.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    private static final int MOD = 1000000007;
    
    public int createSortedArray(int[] instructions) {
        int max = Arrays.stream(instructions).max().orElse(0);
        
        FenwickTree fenwickTree = new FenwickTree(max);
        long cost = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < instructions.length; i++) {
            int x = instructions[i];
            int leftCost = fenwickTree.query(x - 1);
            int rightCost = i - fenwickTree.query(x);
            cost += Math.min(leftCost, rightCost);
            fenwickTree.update(x, 1);
        }
        
        return (int)(cost % MOD);
    }

    class FenwickTree {
        private int[] tree;
        
        public FenwickTree(int size) {
            tree = new int[size + 1];
        }
        
        public void update(int index, int value) {
            while (index < tree.length) {
                tree[index] += value;
                index += index & -index;
            }
        }
        
        public int query(int index) {
            int sum = 0;
            while (index > 0) {
                sum += tree[index];
                index -= index & -index;
            }
            return sum;
        }
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Use a Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree)**: A Fenwick Tree allows us to efficiently query and update the number of elements less than and greater than a certain value.
  
2. **Processing each element**:
    - For each element `x`, calculate:
        - `leftCost`: The number of elements in the `sortedArray` that are less than `x` (use `query(x-1)`).
        - `rightCost`: The number of elements in the `sortedArray` that are greater than `x` (by calculating the difference).
    - Update the Fenwick Tree after processing each element.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
    - Since the total cost might be very large, we use modulo operation with \(10^9 + 7\).

### Time Complexity

- **Fenwick Tree Update/Query**: O(log n)
- **Process each element in `instructions`**: O(n log m), where n is the length of `instructions` and m is the maximum element value.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n log m), which should be efficient given the constraints.
