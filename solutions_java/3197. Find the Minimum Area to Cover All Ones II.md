[Leetcode 3197. Find the Minimum Area to Cover All Ones II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3197)
## Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed binary matrix `grid` of size `m x n`. The grid contains at least one `1`. You have to find the minimum area of a rectangle that can cover all the `1`s in the matrix.

### Example
```text
Input: grid = [
  [1, 0, 0, 0], 
  [0, 1, 1, 1],
  [0, 1, 0, 0]
]
Output: 6
Explanation: The minimum rectangle covering all 1's has an area = 6.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Clarifications on Input:** Can the grid have non-binary values or be empty? 
   - **Assumption:** The grid will contain only `0`s and `1`s and will always contain at least one `1`.
   
2. **Edge Cases:** Do we need to consider the edge cases of smallest grid (like 1x1)?
   - **Assumption:** Yes, smallest grid such as 1x1 with 1 in it should be taken into account.

## Strategy
The task requires identifying the smallest rectangle that can cover all the cells containing `1` in the matrix. To achieve this:
1. Traverse the entire grid to collect the positions of all `1`s.
2. Determine the minimum and maximum values for both row and column indices where `1`s are present.
3. Compute the dimensions of the rectangle based on these min and max values and use that to calculate the area.

### Steps:
1. Initialize variables to track the minimum and maximum row and column values where `1` is found.
2. Iterate through the grid once to update these variables based on the positions of `1`s.
3. Use the differences between the maximum and minimum values of the rows and columns to calculate the dimensions (height and width) of the rectangle.
4. Compute and return the area of this rectangle.

## Code
```java
public class MinimumAreaRectangle {
    public int minArea(int[][] grid) {
        int minRow = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int maxRow = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int minCol = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int maxCol = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        
        int rows = grid.length;
        int cols = grid[0].length;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    minRow = Math.min(minRow, i);
                    maxRow = Math.max(maxRow, i);
                    minCol = Math.min(minCol, j);
                    maxCol = Math.max(maxCol, j);
                }
            }
        }
        
        int height = maxRow - minRow + 1;
        int width = maxCol - minCol + 1;
        int area = height * width;
        
        return area;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumAreaRectangle solution = new MinimumAreaRectangle();
        
        int[][] grid = {
            {1, 0, 0, 0},
            {0, 1, 1, 1},
            {0, 1, 0, 0}
        };
        
        System.out.println(solution.minArea(grid)); // Output should be 6
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid. This is because we need to traverse each element of the grid once to determine the positions of all `1`s.

The space complexity is `O(1)`, as we only use a fixed amount of extra space to store the minimum and maximum indices.
