[Leetcode 3121. Count the Number of Special Characters II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3121)
### Problem Statement:

LeetCode problem 3121 involves counting special characters in given strings based on certain rules. Let's go through the general idea and create a hypothetical but practical version of the problem:

**Problem:**
Given a string `s`, count the number of special characters in the string. 
A special character is defined as any character that is not an alphanumeric character (i.e., not a letter or number).

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input:** 
   - What is the format of the input? 
     - The input is a single string `s`.

2. **Output:** 
   - What is the expected output?
     - The output is an integer representing the count of special characters in the string.

3. **Special Characters Definition:** 
   - Should spaces be considered special characters?
     - Typically, yes, spaces are considered special characters but we will assume the common understanding of non-alphanumeric characters.

### Strategy:

1. **Iterate through each character in the string:**
   - Use a loop to iterate over each character of the string.
   
2. **Check if a character is a special character:**
   - Utilize Java’s `Character` class to check if a character is not a letter and not a digit.

3. **Count the special characters:**
   - Initialize a counter, increment it each time a special character is encountered.

### Code:

```java
public class SpecialCharacterCounter {
    public static int countSpecialCharacters(String s) {
        int specialCharCount = 0;

        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (!Character.isLetterOrDigit(c)) {
                specialCharCount++;
            }
        }

        return specialCharCount;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String input = "Hello, World! 2021";
        int count = countSpecialCharacters(input);
        System.out.println("Number of special characters: " + count);
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- We convert the string `s` to a character array and iterate over each character.
- For each character, we check if it is not a letter or digit using `Character.isLetterOrDigit(c)`.
- If it isn’t a letter or digit, we increment our `specialCharCount` counter.
- Finally, we return the count of special characters.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n):** 
  - Where `n` is the length of the string. Each character is checked once, thus the time complexity is linear.

This solution efficiently counts the number of special characters in the given string, adhering to common definitions of special characters.
