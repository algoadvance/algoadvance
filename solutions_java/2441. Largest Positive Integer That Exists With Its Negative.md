[Leetcode 2441. Largest Positive Integer That Exists With Its Negative](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2441)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` that does not contain any zeros. Find the largest positive integer `k` such that `-k` also exists in the array. Return the positive integer `k`. If there is no such integer, return -1.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain duplicate elements?**
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicate elements.
   
2. **What is the range of the number of elements in the array?**
   - The size of the array ranges from 1 to 1000.
   
3. **What is the range of the elements in the array?**
   - The elements in the array range from -1000 to 1000.

## Strategy

1. **Use a Set for Lookup:**
   - We can use a HashSet to keep track of the elements in the array because it allows for average O(1) time complexity for add and contains operations.
   
2. **Iterate and Check:**
   - Iterate through the array and for each positive number, check if its negative counterpart exists in the set.
   - Keep track of the largest such positive number found.

## Code

Let's implement this strategy in Java:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;

public class Solution {
    public int findMaxK(int[] nums) {
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        int maxK = -1;
        
        // Add all elements to the set
        for (int num : nums) {
            set.add(num);
        }
        
        // Check for the largest positive number k such that -k exists
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num > 0 && set.contains(-num)) {
                maxK = Math.max(maxK, num);
            }
        }
        
        return maxK;
    }

    // Example test for verification
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {3, 2, -2, 5, -3};
        System.out.println(solution.findMaxK(nums)); // Output should be 3
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
  - Adding elements to the set takes O(n).
  - Iterating through the array to find the largest `k` also takes O(n).

- **Space Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
  - We are using a HashSet to store the elements which in the worst-case scenario will have all the n elements.
