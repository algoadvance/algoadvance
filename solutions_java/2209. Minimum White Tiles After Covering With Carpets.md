[Leetcode 2209. Minimum White Tiles After Covering With Carpets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2209)
### Problem Statement

You are given a binary string `floor`, which represents the floor, and a positive integer `numCarpets`, and a positive integer `carpetLen`. The binary string `floor` represents the tiles on the floor as:
- '0' indicates a white tile,
- '1' indicates a black tile.

You have `numCarpets` of length `carpetLen`, which you can place over the floor. Each carpet can cover `carpetLen` consecutive tiles. Tiles covered by carpets turn into black tiles.

Your goal is to minimize the number of white tiles that are not covered by carpets. Return the minimum number of white tiles that remain uncovered on the floor.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input constraints:**
   - The length of the `floor` string is between 1 and 1000.
   - The number of carpets `numCarpets` is at most 1000.
   - The length of each carpet `carpetLen` is between 1 and 1000.

2. **Behavioral constraints:**
   - If a carpet is larger than the remaining tiles, it just covers all the remaining tiles.
   - The carpet can begin covering from any position.

3. **Examples:**
   - Example 1:
     - `floor = "10110101"`, `numCarpets = 2`, `carpetLen = 2`
     - Output: 2
   - Example 2:
     - `floor = "11111"`, `numCarpets = 2`, `carpetLen = 3`
     - Output: 0

### Strategy

We'll use Dynamic Programming (DP) to solve this problem.

1. **Define DP State:**
   - Let `dp[i][j]` be the minimum number of white tiles in the substring `floor[0:i+1]` covered by `j` carpets.

2. **Transitions:**
   - If no carpets are used, then `dp[i][0] = count of '0's in floor[0:i+1]`.
   - If using carpets, either:
     - Place the j-th carpet to cover `floor[i-carpetLen+1:i+1]` or 
     - Not place the j-th carpet.

   Using these transitions, we can build up our DP array.

3. **Initial DP State:**
   - dp[0][j] = 0 for all `j` since no tiles need to be covered initially without any white tiles.

4. **Final State:**
   - The desired answer will be `dp[n-1][numCarpets]` where `n` is the length of the `floor`.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minimumWhiteTiles(String floor, int numCarpets, int carpetLen) {
        int n = floor.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][numCarpets + 1];
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= numCarpets; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2;
            }
        }
        
        dp[0][0] = (floor.charAt(0) == '0' ? 1 : 0);
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + (floor.charAt(i-1) == '0' ? 1 : 0);
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= numCarpets; j++) {
                // Either we don't use the j-th carpet
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + (floor.charAt(i-1) == '0' ? 1 : 0);
                // Or we use the j-th carpet to cover the tiles up to carpetLen
                if (i >= carpetLen) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], dp[i-carpetLen][j-1]);
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], 0); // covering all tiles
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n][numCarpets];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization:** `O(n)`
- **Main DP Loop:** `O(n * numCarpets)`
- **Total:** The overall complexity is approximately `O(n * numCarpets)`, where `n` is the length of the floor string and `numCarpets` is the number of carpets.

This solution ensures that we efficiently use dynamic programming to handle the constraints effectively.
