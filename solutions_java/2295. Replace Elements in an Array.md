[Leetcode 2295. Replace Elements in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2295)
### Problem Statement

**LeetCode Problem 2295: Replace Elements in an Array**

You are given a 0-indexed array `nums` that consists of `n` distinct positive integers. Apply `m` operations to this array where, in the `i-th` operation, you replace the number `operations[i][0]` with `operations[i][1]`.

It is guaranteed that in the `i-th` operation:
- `operations[i][0]` exists in `nums`.
- `operations[i][1]` does not exist in `nums`.

Return the array after applying all the operations.

**Example:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,4,6], operations = [[1,3],[4,7],[6,1]]
Output: [3,2,7,1]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. What happens if `nums` or `operations` are empty?
    - If `nums` is empty, the result will also be an empty list. If `operations` is empty, `nums` will remain unchanged.

2. Can `operations` have duplicate replacements?
    - Each operation is independent and unique as per the problem constraints, ensuring no conflicts.

3. What are the constraints on the size of `nums` and `operations`?
    - Let's assume the constraints are reasonable enough for an algorithm to run efficiently within O(n * m) time complexity.

4. Is there any specific order that operations need to be applied in?
    - Yes, they should be applied in the given order.

### Strategy
The core of the solution involves:
1. **Tracking indices:** Create a hash map to quickly locate the index of any given number in the `nums` array.
2. **Processing operations:** Update `nums` and the hash map according to each operation.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    public int[] arrayChange(int[] nums, int[][] operations) {
        // Create a map to store the number and its index in nums
        Map<Integer, Integer> valueToIndex = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            valueToIndex.put(nums[i], i);
        }

        // Apply each operation
        for (int[] operation : operations) {
            int oldVal = operation[0];
            int newVal = operation[1];
            
            // Get the index of the old value in nums
            int index = valueToIndex.get(oldVal);
            
            // Replace the old value with the new value in nums
            nums[index] = newVal;
            
            // Update the hash map to reflect the change
            valueToIndex.remove(oldVal);
            valueToIndex.put(newVal, index);
        }

        return nums;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 4, 6};
        int[][] operations = // use example from above
        int[] result = sol.arrayChange(nums, operations);
        
        for (int num : result) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **HashMap creation:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the `nums` array because each element is added to the map.
- **Processing operations:** O(m) for iterating over `operations`, and each `put` operation in the map is O(1), yielding O(1) for each operation.
  
So, the overall time complexity is:
\[ O(n) + O(m) = O(n + m) \]

This ensures efficient handling of the input sizes within the problem constraints.
