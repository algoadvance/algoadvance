[Leetcode 1255. Maximum Score Words Formed by Letters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1255)
### Problem Statement
Given a list of words, a list of single letters (each letter can be used only once), and a score for each character, return the maximum score of any valid set of words formed by using the given letters (words canâ€™t be used more than once).

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the length of the words list, and what range of lengths should the words be?
   - Any special characters allowed, or is it strictly lowercase English letters?
   - Maximum possible score for a character?

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Should the output be an integer representing the maximum score or should it include words making up the score as well?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should be returned if no words can be formed (due to lack of sufficient letters)?

#### Clarifications given:
1. The words list length and word lengths are reasonably small and within typical competitive programming constraints.
2. The letters are restricted to lowercase English letters.
3. The maximum score per character is bound by constraints given in the problem.

### Strategy
Here's a strategy to solve the problem:
1. **Backtracking:** We'll recursively try to include or exclude each word to find all valid combinations.
2. **Score Calculation:** Maintain the current score using a function that calculates the score of a word based on the available letters and character scores.
3. **Validation:** Before adding a word to our current combination, we'll ensure that we have enough letters to form that word.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxScoreWords(String[] words, char[] letters, int[] score) {
        int[] letterCount = new int[26];
        for (char c : letters) {
            letterCount[c - 'a']++;
        }
        return backtrack(words, letterCount, score, 0);
    }

    private int backtrack(String[] words, int[] letterCount, int[] score, int index) {
        if (index == words.length) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        // Skip the current word
        int maxScore = backtrack(words, letterCount, score, index + 1);

        // Try to include the current word
        int wordScore = 0;
        boolean canFormWord = true;
        String word = words[index];
        int[] tempCount = letterCount.clone();

        for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
            tempCount[c - 'a']--;
            if (tempCount[c - 'a'] < 0) {
                canFormWord = false;
            }
            wordScore += score[c - 'a'];
        }

        if (canFormWord) {
            maxScore = Math.max(maxScore, wordScore + backtrack(words, tempCount, score, index + 1));
        }

        return maxScore;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        
        String[] words = {"dog", "cat", "dad", "good"};
        char[] letters = {'a','a','c','d','d','g','o','o'};
        int[] score = {1,0,9,5,0,0,3,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,2,0,0,0,0,0,0,0};
        
        System.out.println(sol.maxScoreWords(words, letters, score));  // Output: expected max score
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Overall Complexity:** `O(2^n * (k + 26))`
  - Here, `n` is the number of words and `k` is the maximum word length.
  - Each word can either be included or excluded, resulting in `2^n` combinations.
  - For each combination, we'll need to validate the word which requires checking up to `k` characters (assuming `k` as max word length) and maintaining letter counts (26 operations).

### Conclusion
The backtracking solution provides a comprehensive way to explore all possible word combinations and calculate the maximum score efficiently. The time complexity, though exponential in nature, is suitable for constraints typically given in related problems.
