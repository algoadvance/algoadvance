[Leetcode 1203. Sort Items by Groups Respecting Dependencies](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1203)
## Problem Statement

Given `n` items each belonging to a group, and some groups may not contain items. Each item may have prerequisites represented as a direct graph. We need to sort these items respecting the following constraints:
1. A group can only start after all its dependent groups have finished.
2. An item can only start after all its dependent items have finished.

Return the sorted order of all the `n` items, or an empty list if there is no valid solution.

### Input

1. `n`: total number of items, an integer `1 ≤ n ≤ 3 * 10^4`
2. `m`: total number of groups, an integer `1 ≤ m ≤ 1 * 10^4`
3. `group`: an array of length `n`, where `group[i]` is the group the item `i` belongs to, and if the item doesn't belong to any group, it will be `-1`.
4. `beforeItems`: a list of lists of length `n`, where `beforeItems[i]` is a list containing all the items that need to be finished before item `i` starts.

### Output

Return either:
- A list of integers representing the sorted order of items.
- An empty list `[]` if no valid sort order exists.

## Clarifying Questions

- `Q`: Can groups have dependencies on other groups directly?
- `A`: Group dependencies are implied by the dependencies of the items. There are no explicit group dependencies provided.
  
- `Q`: Is it possible for an item to belong to no group?
- `A`: Yes, an item can belong to no group, indicated by `-1`.

- `Q`: Can you clarify about dependencies between items within the same group versus items in different groups?
  - Could item X in group `A` depend on item Y in group `B`?
- `A`: Yes, an item in one group can depend on an item in another group, and vice versa.

## Strategy

1. **Assign Unique Groups to Ungrouped Items:** First, assign unique group IDs to ungrouped items to handle them appropriately in the process.

2. **Topological Sort of Items:** Execute a topological sort for the items considering item dependencies.

3. **Topological Sort of Groups:** After sorting items, group them by their respective groups and then sort the groups based on the dependencies between them.

4. **Combine Results:** Ensure that the final item order respects both the item-level dependencies and group-level dependencies.

### Code Implementation

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> sortItems(int n, int m, int[] group, List<List<Integer>> beforeItems) {
        // Step 1: Assign unique group IDs to ungrouped items
        int nextGroupId = m;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (group[i] == -1) {
                group[i] = nextGroupId++;
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Initialize structures
        List<Integer>[] itemGraph = new List[n];
        int[] itemIndegree = new int[n];
        
        List<Integer>[] groupGraph = new List[nextGroupId];
        int[] groupIndegree = new int[nextGroupId];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            itemGraph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        for (int i = 0; i < nextGroupId; i++) {
            groupGraph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }

        // Build the dependency graph
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int prev : beforeItems.get(i)) {
                itemGraph[prev].add(i);
                itemIndegree[i]++;
                if (group[i] != group[prev]) {
                    groupGraph[group[prev]].add(group[i]);
                    groupIndegree[group[i]]++;
                }
            }
        }

        // Step 3: Topological sort for items
        List<Integer> itemOrder = topologicalSort(itemGraph, itemIndegree, n);

        if (itemOrder.isEmpty()) {
            return new ArrayList<>();
        }

        // Step 4: Topological sort for groups
        List<Integer> groupOrder = topologicalSort(groupGraph, groupIndegree, nextGroupId);

        if (groupOrder.isEmpty()) {
            return new ArrayList<>();
        }

        // Step 5: Combine results
        List<Integer>[] groupedItems = new List[nextGroupId];
        for (int i = 0; i < nextGroupId; i++) {
            groupedItems[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        for (int item : itemOrder) {
            groupedItems[group[item]].add(item);
        }

        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int grp : groupOrder) {
            result.addAll(groupedItems[grp]);
        }

        return result;
    }

    // Helper: Topological Sort using Kahn's Algorithm
    private List<Integer> topologicalSort(List<Integer>[] graph, int[] indegree, int numNodes) {
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < numNodes; i++) {
            if (indegree[i] == 0) {
                queue.offer(i);
            }
        }

        List<Integer> order = new ArrayList<>();
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int current = queue.poll();
            order.add(current);
            for (int neighbor : graph[current]) {
                if (--indegree[neighbor] == 0) {
                    queue.offer(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }

        return order.size() == numNodes ? order : new ArrayList<>();
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Assign unique IDs**: `O(n)`
2. **Build Graphs**: `O(n + E)` where `E` is the total number of dependencies in `beforeItems`
3. **Topological Sort of Items**: `O(n + E)`
4. **Topological Sort of Groups**: `O(m + G)` where `G` is the total number of group dependencies inferred from item dependencies

Overall, the combined time complexity of the solution is `O(n + E)`, where `E` represents the total number of dependencies.

This solution effectively handles up to the problem constraints and ensures both item-level and group-level dependencies are respected.
