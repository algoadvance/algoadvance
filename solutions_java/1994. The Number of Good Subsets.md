[Leetcode 1994. The Number of Good Subsets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1994)
### Problem Statement

The problem is:

> Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of **good subsets** of `nums`. Since the answer may be too large, return it **modulo 10^9 + 7**.
>
> A **good subset** is a subset such that:
> 1. The product of its elements is a **square-free** number (A number is square-free if no square of a prime divides the number, i.e., for every prime `p`, `p^2` does not divide the number).
> 2. The product of its elements is greater than 1.
>
> A subset can be any non-empty subset of the original array. Two subsets are different if the order of elements is different.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size range of the array `nums`?**
   - Typical constraint: `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`

2. **What are the value constraints for the elements in `nums`?**
   - Typical constraint: `1 <= nums[i] <= 30`. The upper bound of 30 keeps the problem computationally feasible with manageable prime numbers.

3. **How should we handle duplicate elements in `nums`?**
   - Each element is distinct in its index, and all subsets that comply with the criteria are considered.

### Strategy

1. **Count occurrences of numbers**: Since the maximum number we are considering is 30, we will keep an array count of each number.
2. **Consider the prime factors**: Numbers between 1 and 30 can be factorized into primes. We will only consider numbers that are square-free.
3. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: Use a bitmask to indicate the presence or absence of prime factors.
4. **Subset Product Checking**: We will iteratively check for each number whether including it in a subset would still maintain a square-free product.
5. **Handling special cases**: Handle numbers like 1 specially, as they do not contribute to the prime factor product directly but can be part of multiple subsets.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public int numberOfGoodSubsets(int[] nums) {
        final int MOD = 1000000007;
        int[] count = new int[31];
        for (int num : nums) {
            count[num]++;
        }

        int[] primes = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29};
        int maxMask = 1 << primes.length;
        long[] dp = new long[maxMask];
        dp[0] = 1;

        for (int num = 2; num <= 30; num++) {
            if (count[num] == 0 || !isSquareFree(num)) {
                continue;
            }

            int numMask = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < primes.length; j++) {
                if (num % primes[j] == 0) {
                    numMask |= 1 << j;
                }
            }

            for (int mask = maxMask - 1; mask >= 0; mask--) {
                if ((mask & numMask) == 0) {
                    dp[mask | numMask] = (dp[mask | numMask] + dp[mask] * count[num]) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }

        long result = 0;
        for (int mask = 1; mask < maxMask; mask++) {
            result = (result + dp[mask]) % MOD;
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < count[1]; i++) {
            result = (result * 2) % MOD;
        }

        return (int) result;
    }

    private boolean isSquareFree(int num) {
        int[] primes = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29};
        for (int prime : primes) {
            if (num % (prime * prime) == 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        System.out.println(sol.numberOfGoodSubsets(nums));  // Example call to test the function
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing**: Counting elements and factorizing (constant time due to small bounds, i.e., O(30)).
- **DP Transition**: Iteration over the bitmask for each number, leading to O(N * 2^k) where N is the length of nums and k is the number of primes up to 30 (a constant).
- **Overall Complexity**: O(N * 2^10) (since there are 10 primes â‰¤ 30), which is feasible.

The solution is efficient given the constraints and makes use of dynamic programming and bit masking to ensure square-free subset product checks.
