[Leetcode 1621. Number of Sets of K Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1621)
## Problem Statement

**LeetCode 1621:** Number of Sets of K Non-Overlapping Line Segments

You are given n points labeled from 0 to n - 1. You are also given an integer k. Return the number of sets of k non-overlapping line segments you can draw such that each segment connects two distinct points.

These segments must be non-overlapping: A set of k segments is considered non-overlapping if no two segments share a common point.

Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Example
```text
Input: n = 4, k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: The five sets of 2 non-overlapping line segments are:
[[0,1], [2,3]], [[0,2], [1,3]], [[0,3], [1,2]], [[0,1], [1,3]], [[0,2], [2,3]]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the bounds for n and k?**
   - This will help determine the feasibility of different approaches based on input size.

2. **Do the line segments need to be considered as directed or undirected?**
   - Aren't direction and order of points significant?

3. **Any constraints on performance and space complexity?**
   - This will influence the choice of an iterative or recursive approach or perhaps the use of memoization.

## Strategy

The problem can be approached using Dynamic Programming (DP). We need to count the number of sets of k non-overlapping line segments on n points.

### Steps:

1. **Define DP State:**
   - Let `dp[i][j]` be the number of ways to choose `j` non-overlapping line segments from the first `i` points.

2. **Base Case:**
   - `dp[0][0] = 1`: There's 1 way to choose 0 segments from 0 points (do nothing).
   - For all other `j > 0`, `dp[0][j] = 0`: No segments can be formed without points.

3. **Transition:**
   - To form `j` segments from `i` points, consider each possible end point `l` of the last segment.
   - Sum up dp values where `l-1` segments are formed from `i-2` or fewer points (i.e., `dp[i-2][j-1]` considering the segment from `i-1 to i`).

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Since the result could be large, take results modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Code:

Hereâ€™s how you can implement this using Java:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    private static final int MOD = 1000000007;

    public int numberOfSets(int n, int k) {
        int[][] dp = new int[n+1][k+1];
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = 1; // 1 way to choose zero segments
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
                for (int p = 0; p < i; p++) {
                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[p][j-1]) % MOD;
                }
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i-1][j]) % MOD;
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n][k];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.numberOfSets(4, 2)); // Output: 5
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2 * k) due to the nested loops iterating over the range of points and segments. This approach might not scale for large values of `n` and `k`, but it demonstrates the core idea effectively. For larger inputs, optimizations or different combinatorial insights could be necessary.
