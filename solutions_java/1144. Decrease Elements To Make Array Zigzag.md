[Leetcode 1144. Decrease Elements To Make Array Zigzag](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1144)
### Problem Statement:

Given an array of integers `nums`, a "zigzag" array requires that each element in the array satisfies one of the following conditions:
- If the element is at an even index `i`, `nums[i]` should be less than the elements adjacent to it, i.e., `nums[i] < nums[i-1]` and `nums[i] < nums[i+1]` (if they exist).
- If the element is at an odd index `i`, `nums[i]` should be less than the elements adjacent to it, i.e., `nums[i] < nums[i-1]` and `nums[i] < nums[i+1]` (if they exist).

The objective is to determine the minimum number of operations required to transform the given array into a zigzag array. In one operation, you can decrease the value of any element of the array by 1.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q:** Can the array be empty?
   **A:** No, the problem implies that there is at least one element in the array.

2. **Q:** What if the array has only one element?
   **A:** If the array has only one element, it is trivially a zigzag array, and the answer would be 0 operations.

3. **Q:** Can the elements of the array be negative?
   **A:** Yes, the elements can be negative.

### Strategy:

To solve this problem, we can take the following steps:

1. Consider two scenarios:
   - Make the even indexed elements smaller than their neighbors.
   - Make the odd indexed elements smaller than their neighbors.
   
2. For each scenario, calculate the number of operations needed.

3. Return the minimum number of operations from both scenarios.

### Code:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int movesToMakeZigzag(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        
        // Calculate for even index smaller condition
        int movesEvenSmaller = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i += 2) {
            int left = (i > 0) ? nums[i-1] : Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            int right = (i < n-1) ? nums[i+1] : Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            int minNeighbor = Math.min(left, right);
            if (nums[i] >= minNeighbor) {
                movesEvenSmaller += nums[i] - minNeighbor + 1;
            }
        }
        
        // Calculate for odd index smaller condition
        int movesOddSmaller = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i += 2) {
            int left = nums[i-1];
            int right = (i < n-1) ? nums[i+1] : Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            int minNeighbor = Math.min(left, right);
            if (nums[i] >= minNeighbor) {
                movesOddSmaller += nums[i] - minNeighbor + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return Math.min(movesEvenSmaller, movesOddSmaller);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] nums1 = {1, 2, 3};
        System.out.println(solution.movesToMakeZigzag(nums1));  // Output: 2

        int[] nums2 = {9, 6, 1, 6, 2};
        System.out.println(solution.movesToMakeZigzag(nums2));  // Output: 4
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of the solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array. We iterate through the array twice (once for even indices and once for odd indices). Thus, it effectively takes linear time to compute the minimum operations needed to make the array zigzag.
