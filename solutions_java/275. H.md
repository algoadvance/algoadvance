[Leetcode 275. H](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l275)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `citations` sorted in ascending order (each integer represents the number of citations a researcher has received for their paper), return the researcher's h-index.

A scientist has an index h if h of their `N` papers have at least `h` citations each, and the other `N - h` papers have no more than `h` citations each.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log N)` time.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: citations = [0,1,3,5,6]
Output: 3
Explanation: [0,1,3,5,6] means the researcher has 5 papers in total and each of them had received 0, 1, 3, 5, 6 citations respectively. 
Since the researcher has 3 papers with at least 3 citations each and the remaining two with no more than 3 citations each, their h-index is 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: citations = [1,2,100]
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

* The array `citations` is sorted in ascending order.
* `n == citations.length`
* `1 <= n <= 10^5`
* `0 <= citations[i] <= 1000`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Is the array guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order as given?
   **A:** Yes, the array `citations` is always sorted in non-decreasing order.
   
2. **Q:** Can the array contain duplicate citation values?
   **A:** Yes, duplicate values can be present in the array.
   
3. **Q:** Is it possible for all values in `citations` to be zero?
   **A:** Yes, it is possible, and in such cases, the h-index would be `0`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem within `O(log N)` time complexity, we can use a binary search algorithm. The goal is to find the maximal `h` such that there are at least `h` papers with `h` or more citations.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize `left` to `0`, and `right` to `n - 1`.
2. Use binary search to find the h-index:
   - Calculate the middle point `mid = left + (right - left) / 2`.
   - Check if `citations[mid]` is a valid h-index:
     - If `n - mid` (number of papers with at least `mid` citations) is greater than or equal to `citations[mid]`, move the search to the right half by setting `left` to `mid + 1`.
     - Otherwise, move the search to the left half by setting `right` to `mid - 1`.
3. Continue this until `left` exceeds `right`.
4. The maximum valid `h` will be `n - left` after breaking out of the loop.

This way, we ensure the solution works efficiently in `O(log N)` time.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
        int n = citations.length;
        int left = 0, right = n - 1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (citations[mid] == n - mid) {
                return n - mid;
            } else if (citations[mid] < n - mid) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return n - left;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(log N)` due to the binary search.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` as we are not using any extra space other than a few variables.

This solution meets the problem's constraints and ensures an efficient runtime.
