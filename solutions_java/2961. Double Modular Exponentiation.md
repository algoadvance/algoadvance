[Leetcode 2961. Double Modular Exponentiation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2961)
### Problem Statement

You are given three integers `a`, `b`, and `m`. Your task is to compute \( (a^b) \mod m \). 

Write a function:

```java
public int doubleModularExponentiation(int a, int b, int m)
```

To efficiently perform this computation.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Inputs**: 
   - What is the range of `a`, `b`, and `m`? 
     - Typically, problems like this have constraints such that \( 0 \leq a \leq 10^9, 0 \leq b \leq 10^9, 1 \leq m \leq 10^9 \).

2. **Constraints**:
   - Can `a`, `b`, or `m` be zero?
     - If \( m \) is zero, the modulo operation is undefined. Typically, it is safe to assume \( m \geq 1 \).

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - What should be the output if `b` is 0?
     - Typically, any number raised to the power of 0 is 1 (given \( m \) is a positive integer).

### Strategy

To efficiently compute \( (a^b) \mod m \), we can use **modular exponentiation**. This technique, often implemented via a method called **Exponentiation by Squaring**, allows us to compute the result in \( O(\log b) \) time complexity. This is significantly faster than the naive approach which would take \( O(b) \) operations.

**Exponentiation by Squaring** works by recursively breaking down the problem into smaller subproblems:

- If `b` is 0, return 1 (since any number to the power of 0 is 1).
- Compute intermediate results by squaring the base and reducing the exponent by half at each step:
  - If `b` is even: \( a^b = (a^{b/2})^2 \).
  - If `b` is odd: \( a^b = a \cdot (a^{b-1}) \).

To ensure the result never gets too large, intermediate results are taken modulo `m` during the computation.

### Code

Here's the Java implementation of the described approach:

```java
public class Solution {

    public int doubleModularExponentiation(int a, int b, int m) {
        if (m == 1) {
            return 0; // Since any number % 1 is 0
        }
        int result = 1;
        long base = a % m;
        while (b > 0) {
            if ((b & 1) == 1) { // If b is odd
                result = (int)((result * base) % m);
            }
            base = (base * base) % m;
            b >>= 1; // equivalent to b = b / 2
        }
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.doubleModularExponentiation(2, 10, 1000)); // Should output 24
        System.out.println(sol.doubleModularExponentiation(2, 5, 13));    // Should output 6
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \( O(\log b) \) because the exponent `b` is effectively being halved at each step in the while loop. The space complexity is \( O(1) \) since we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

By leveraging these properties, the solution efficiently handles even very large inputs within the given constraints.
