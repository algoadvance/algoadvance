[Leetcode 214. Shortest Palindrome](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l214)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s`. You need to convert it to the shortest possible palindrome by adding characters in front of it. You should return the shortest palindrome you can find by performing the conversion.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the string `s` empty or can it be empty?**
   - If the string is empty, the result would be an empty string.

2. **What are the possible characters in the string `s`?**
   - The string `s` consists of lowercase and/or uppercase English letters.

3. **What should be returned if the input is already a palindrome?**
   - If the input is already a palindrome, the function should return the string `s` itself.

4. **Are there any constraints on the length of the string `s`?**
   - The problem generally does not specify, but in typical interviews or test cases, strings can be up to a length within reasonable limits, such as 10^5 characters.

### Strategy

To find the shortest palindrome, we need to find how much of the end of the string does not match the beginning and mirror that part in front of the original string. 

A more efficient way to achieve this is by using the Knuth-Morris-Pratt (KMP) algorithm to find the longest prefix of the string which is also a suffix. This helps in avoiding unnecessary comparisons.

Here's the strategy in steps:
1. Create a new string by appending `s` with a special character (not in `s`) and the reverse of `s`. Let's call this string `combined = s + "#" + rev(s)`.
2. Use the KMP algorithm to create a table of longest proper prefix which is also suffix (LPS array) for the `combined` string.
3. Use the last value of the LPS array to determine the maximum length of palindrome starting from index 0.
4. Append the necessary characters in front to make it the shortest palindrome.

### Code Implementation

```java
public class Solution {
    public String shortestPalindrome(String s) {
        // Edge case: if the string is empty, return an empty string
        if (s.length() == 0) {
            return "";
        }
        
        // Reverse the string
        String revS = new StringBuilder(s).reverse().toString();
        
        // Create combined string
        String combined = s + "#" + revS;
        
        // Compute the LPS array for the combined string using KMP algorithm
        int[] lps = computeLPSArray(combined);
        
        // The length of the longest palindrome substring starting at index 0
        int palindromeLength = lps[lps.length - 1];
        
        // Add the necessary characters in front of the original string
        String addPrefix = revS.substring(0, s.length() - palindromeLength);
        
        return addPrefix + s;
    }
    
    private int[] computeLPSArray(String s) {
        int[] lps = new int[s.length()];
        int length = 0; // Length of the previous longest prefix suffix
        int i = 1;
        
        // LPS[0] is always 0, so we start with i = 1
        while (i < s.length()) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(length)) {
                length++;
                lps[i] = length;
                i++;
            } else { 
                if (length != 0) {
                    length = lps[length - 1];
                } else { 
                    lps[i] = 0;
                    i++;
                }
            }
        }
        return lps;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity for creating the reversed string and combined string is O(n), where n is the length of the given string `s`.
- Computing the LPS array for the combined string is also O(n).
- Overall, the time complexity of this solution is O(n), making it efficient for large inputs.

Note that the space complexity is likewise O(n) due to the space used for the combined string and the LPS array.
