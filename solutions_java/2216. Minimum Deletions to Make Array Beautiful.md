[Leetcode 2216. Minimum Deletions to Make Array Beautiful](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2216)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. The array `nums` is beautiful if:

- `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all `i % 2 == 0`.

You can delete any number of elements from `nums`. Return the minimum number of deletions required to make `nums` beautiful.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of the length of the array `nums`? 
     - Typically, constraints will be 1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10^5.
   - What is the range of the values in `nums`?
     - Usually, the values would lie within constraints like -10^9 ≤ nums[i] ≤ 10^9.

2. **Output:**
   - Should the function return an integer that represents the minimum number of deletions?

3. **Initial Validation:**
   - What if `nums` already satisfies the condition? The deletion count would be zero.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate and Compare:**
   - Start from the beginning of the array and traverse every even index.
   - Check if `nums[i] == nums[i+1]` for each even index `i`. If so, increment a counter because this indicates the position is not "beautiful".

2. **Deleting Elements:**
   - We don't actually need to delete elements in our array; instead, we count how many elements would need to be deleted to achieve the desired condition.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `nums` has a length of 1, it is already beautiful.
   - If `nums` has alternating pairs being the same, every alternate pair would require deletions to maintain the even-index condition.

### Code

Here's the Java implementation for the solution:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minDeletion(int[] nums) {
        int deletions = 0;
        
        // Traverse the array to check the conditions for beautiful array
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            // Current index adjusted for deletions
            int currentIndex = i - deletions;
            // If current index is even and the next element is the same
            if (currentIndex % 2 == 0 && nums[i] == nums[i + 1]) {
                deletions++;
            }
        }
        
        // If the resulting length is odd, we need to delete one more element to make it even
        if ((nums.length - deletions) % 2 != 0) {
            deletions++;
        }
        
        return deletions;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Traversal Complexity:** The solution involves traversing through the array once, making the complexity `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of `nums`.
- **Auxiliary Space Complexity:** The function uses constant extra space, so the space complexity is `O(1)`.

This solution efficiently determines the minimum number of deletions required to make an array beautiful by simply counting necessary deletions during a single traversal of the array.
