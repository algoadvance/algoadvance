[Leetcode 3139. Minimum Cost to Equalize Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3139)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` of size `n`. You can perform the following operation on the array any number of times:

1. Select an element `nums[i]` and decrement it by `1` (i.e., change `nums[i]` to `nums[i] - 1`).

Your task is to determine the minimum cost to make all elements in the array equal. The cost of each operation is `1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the array can contain negative numbers.
   
2. **Are there constraints on the size of the array or the values within the array?**
   - Let's assume the array size `n` can go up to \(10^5\) and the values within the array can range from \(-10^4\) to \(10^4\).

### Strategy

To equalize the array elements to the same value, it's optimal to choose the median of the array as the target value. This is because the median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations of the elements from the target value (a statistical property).

**Steps:**

1. **Calculate the Median**: Sort the array and pick the middle element as the median.
2. **Compute Total Cost**: Compute the total cost to make all elements equal to the median.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MinimumCostEqualizeArray {
    
    public int minCostToEqualizeArray(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int median = nums[nums.length / 2];
        int cost = 0;
        
        // Calculate the total cost to equalize all elements to the median
        for (int num : nums) {
            cost += Math.abs(num - median);
        }
        
        return cost;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumCostEqualizeArray solution = new MinimumCostEqualizeArray();
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        System.out.println("Minimum cost to equalize array: " + solution.minCostToEqualizeArray(nums));  // Output: 4
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting the Array**: The sorting operation takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array.
2. **Calculating the Total Cost**: This operation takes \(O(n)\) since we traverse the array to calculate the absolute differences.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is \(O(n \log n)\).
