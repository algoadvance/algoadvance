[Leetcode 1936. Add Minimum Number of Rungs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1936)
### Problem Statement
You are given a list of integers `rungs`, which represents the heights of rungs on a ladder, sorted in strictly increasing order. You can add more rungs to the ladder if needed. You are also given an integer `dist`, which represents the maximum distance you can climb from one rung to the next. Your task is to find the minimum number of additional rungs you need to insert into the ladder so that the maximum distance between any two adjacent rungs is at most `dist`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of Input Values:**
    - What is the range of lengths for the rungs array?
    - What are the range of values for the elements in the rungs array and the value of `dist`?

2. **Input Assumptions:**
    - Can the value of `rungs` and `dist` be negative, or are they guaranteed to be positive?
    - Is it guaranteed that the `rungs` array is strictly increasing?

3. **Output Expectations:**
    - Should the function return just the minimum number of additional rungs, or should it also return the modified rungs array?

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int addRungs(int[] rungs, int dist) {
        int additionalRungs = 0;
        int currentHeight = 0;
        
        for (int rung : rungs) {
            if (rung - currentHeight > dist) {
                additionalRungs += (rung - currentHeight - 1) / dist;
            }
            currentHeight = rung;
        }
        
        return additionalRungs;
    }
}
```

### Strategy
1. **Initialization**:
    - Initialize `additionalRungs` to 0 to keep track of the number of rungs we need to add.
    - Use `currentHeight` to represent the height of the last rung we have reached (starting with ground level, 0).

2. **Iteration**:
    - Iterate through each rung in the `rungs` array.
    - For each rung, calculate the distance from the current height.
    - If this distance exceeds `dist`, calculate how many additional rungs are needed. This can be found using `(rung - currentHeight - 1) / dist`, which ensures that we are filling gaps larger than `dist` without over-counting.
    - Update `currentHeight` to the current rung's height.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the rungs array. We need to iterate through each rung in the array exactly once to determine the total number of additional rungs needed.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we only use a few extra variables (`additionalRungs` and `currentHeight`) and do not use any data structures whose size depends on the input size.

This approach ensures efficient handling of the problem using linear time complexity and constant space complexity.
