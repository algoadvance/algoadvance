[Leetcode 2443. Sum of Number and Its Reverse](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2443)
### Problem Statement:
Given a non-negative integer `num`, return `true` if there exists a non-negative integer `x` such that `x + reverse(x) = num`, or `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Constraints**: What is the range of `num`?
   - The problem is not specific about this, but usually constraints would be given for such problems to make optimization easier. For simplicity, we'll assume `num` can be up to 10^7.
   
2. **Reverse Function**: Does the reverse function handle leading zeros properly?
   - Yes, the reverse of `120` would be `21`.

3. **Edge Cases**: What are some edge cases we should consider?
   - When `num = 0`.
   - Large values of `num`.

### Strategy:
1. Loop through possible values of `x` from `0` to `num//2` (since we seek non-negative integers and `x` can never be more than `num` itself for `x + reverse(x)` to equal `num`).
2. For each value of `x`, calculate its reverse.
3. Check if `x + reverse(x) == num`.
4. If a valid `x` is found, return `true`. If the loop completes without finding such `x`, return `false`.

### Code Implementation:
```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean sumOfNumberAndReverse(int num) {
        for (int x = 0; x <= num; x++) {
            // Reverse the number x
            int reversedX = reverse(x);
            // Check if x + reversedX equals num
            if (x + reversedX == num) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    private int reverse(int number) {
        int reversed = 0;
        while (number != 0) {
            int digit = number % 10;
            reversed = reversed * 10 + digit;
            number /= 10;
        }
        return reversed;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Reverse function**: Each reversal operation has a logarithmic time complexity relative to the number of digits, which is `O(log(x))`.
- **Outer loop**: The loop iterates from `0` to `num`, providing a linear time complexity, `O(num)`.

Combining these, the overall time complexity is `O(num * log(num))` considering the loop and the reversing operation combined.

This should be efficient enough for `num` up to values around `10^7`. For larger inputs, additional optimizations may be required.
