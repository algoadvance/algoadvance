[Leetcode 995. Minimum Number of K Consecutive Bit Flips](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l995)
### Problem Statement

You are given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`.

A **k-bit flip** is choosing a **subarray** of length `k` from `nums` and simultaneously flipping all the bits in the subarray (i.e., turning 0s into 1s, and 1s into 0s).

Return the minimum number of k-bit flips required so that there is no 0 in the array. If it is impossible, return -1.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [0,1,0], k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: Flip the first bit, and then the third bit.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,0], k = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: It is impossible to flip the last 2 bits.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [0,0,0,1,0,1,1,0], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: Flip the first k bits (0,0,0), then the middle k bits (0,0,1), and then the last k bits (1,1,0).
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input array be of any size?**
   - Yes, the input array `nums` can vary in length.
   
2. **What is the range of values for `k`?**
   - `k` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and less than or equal to the length of `nums`.

3. **What should be returned if it's already possible to convert `nums` to all 1s without any flips?**
   - If the array is already all 1s, the minimum number of flips is 0, so you should return 0 in this case.

4. **Would there be any special characters or non-binary values in the array?**
   - No, the array will contain only binary values (0s and 1s).

### Strategy

1. **Iterate through the Array**: Traverse the array from the start to the length minus `k`.
2. **Flip subarrays**: Each time a 0 is encountered, flip the current and next `k-1` elements.
3. **Track Flips**: Keep a counter to track the number of flips.
4. **Edge Cases**: If it's not possible to flip enough to turn all bits to 1s (due to the remaining elements being less than `k`), return -1.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minKBitFlips(int[] nums, int k) {
        int flips = 0;
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] isFlipped = new int[n];
        int flipCount = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i >= k) {
                flipCount ^= isFlipped[i - k];
            }
            
            if (flipCount % 2 == nums[i]) {
                if (i + k > n) {
                    return -1;
                }
                flips++;
                flipCount++;
                if (i < n) {
                    isFlipped[i] = 1;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return flips;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        
        int[] nums1 = {0, 1, 0};
        int k1 = 1;
        System.out.println(sol.minKBitFlips(nums1, k1)); // Output: 2
        
        int[] nums2 = {1, 1, 0};
        int k2 = 2;
        System.out.println(sol.minKBitFlips(nums2, k2)); // Output: -1
        
        int[] nums3 = {0, 0, 0, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0};
        int k3 = 3;
        System.out.println(sol.minKBitFlips(nums3, k3)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. This is because each element is processed once in a single pass through the array.

The space complexity is also `O(n)` due to the auxiliary array `isFlipped` used to track flipped operations.
