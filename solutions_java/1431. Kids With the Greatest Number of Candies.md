[Leetcode 1431. Kids With the Greatest Number of Candies](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1431)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `candies` and an integer `extraCandies`, where `candies[i]` represents the number of candies that the `i-th` kid has. For each kid, check if there is a way to distribute the `extraCandies` among the kids such that after giving the `extraCandies` to any one of them, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids. Note that multiple kids can have the greatest number of candies.

Return a boolean array `result` of length `n`, where `result[i]` is `true` if, after giving the `extraCandies` to the `i-th` kid, they can have the greatest number of candies among all the kids, or `false` otherwise.

### Example
```
Input: candies = [2,3,5,1,3], extraCandies = 3
Output: [true,true,true,false,true]

Explanation:
Kid 1 has 2 + 3 = 5 candies total.
Kid 2 has 3 + 3 = 6 candies total.
Kid 3 has 5 + 3 = 8 candies total.
Kid 4 has 1 + 3 = 4 candies total.
Kid 5 has 3 + 3 = 6 candies total.

Only Kid 3 has the greatest number of candies among the kids.
```

### Constraints
- `n == candies.length`
- `2 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= candies[i] <= 100`
- `1 <= extraCandies <= 50`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are there any negative values in the input? 
   - No, the input values will only be positive integers.
2. Can the same number of candies be held by multiple kids after adding the `extraCandies`?
   - Yes, multiple kids can have the same number of candies, and therefore multiple kids can end up with the greatest number.

## Strategy
1. Find the maximum number of candies any kid currently has.
2. For each kid, add `extraCandies` to their current candies.
3. Check if the new value (current candies + extraCandies) is greater than or equal to the maximum candies found in step 1.
4. Return a list of boolean values indicating the result for each kid.

## Code

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;

public class Solution {
    public List<Boolean> kidsWithCandies(int[] candies, int extraCandies) {
        List<Boolean> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int maxCandies = 0;
        
        // Find the maximum candies any kid currently has
        for (int candy : candies) {
            if (candy > maxCandies) {
                maxCandies = candy;
            }
        }
        
        // Determine if each kid can have the greatest number of candies
        for (int candy : candies) {
            if (candy + extraCandies >= maxCandies) {
                result.add(true);
            } else {
                result.add(false);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] candies = {2, 3, 5, 1, 3};
        int extraCandies = 3;
        System.out.println(sol.kidsWithCandies(candies, extraCandies));
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- Finding maximum candies in the `candies` array: O(n)
- Iterating through the `candies` array to determine the boolean result: O(n)
- Total time complexity: O(n)

## Explanation
1. Iterate through the `candies` array to find the maximum number of candies (`maxCandies`) any kid currently has.
2. Iterate through the `candies` array again to check for each kid if their `candies + extraCandies` is greater than or equal to `maxCandies`.
3. Store the result (true or false) in a list and return it.

This problem is efficiently solved with a linear scan approach, ensuring the time complexity remains O(n).
