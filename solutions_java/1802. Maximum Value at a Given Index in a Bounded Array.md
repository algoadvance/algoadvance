[Leetcode 1802. Maximum Value at a Given Index in a Bounded Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1802)
### Problem Statement:

You are given three positive integers: `n`, `index`, and `maxSum`. 

You want to construct an array `nums` (0-indexed) that satisfies the following conditions:

1. `nums.length == n`.
2. `nums[i]` is a positive integer where `0 <= i < n`.
3. `abs(nums[i] - nums[i+1]) <= 1` for every `0 <= i < n-1`.
4. The sum of all elements in `nums` does not exceed `maxSum`.
5. `nums[index]` is maximized.

Return `nums[index]` of the constructed array.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. Can `n` equals 1?
   - Yes, the smallest array length possible is 1.
2. What values can `n`, `index`, and `maxSum` take?
   - They are positive integers where `1 <= n <= 10^9` and `1 <= maxSum <= 10^9`.
3. Are there any constraints on the maximum value of elements in `nums`?
   - No, apart from the sum constraint and that the values should be positive integers.

### Strategy:

1. **Binary Search to Maximize `nums[index]`:**
   - We will use binary search to find the maximum possible value for `nums[index]` such that the total sum of the array does not exceed `maxSum`.
   
2. **Validation Function `isValid(mid)`**:
   - To compute the sum of the elements in the array given a value `mid` for `nums[index]`:
      - Calculate the sum of the elements to the left of `index`.
      - Calculate the sum of the elements to the right of `index`.
      - Ensure the total sum (left sum + right sum + `mid`) â‰¤ `maxSum`.

3. **Calculate Sum for Each Side:**
   - If the number of elements on one side is less than `mid-1`, then simply sum the arithmetic series. Otherwise, use the sum of the first `k` natural numbers formula.

4. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - We initialize our binary search range between 1 and `maxSum`.
   - For each midpoint, use the validation function to check if it is a valid solution.
   - Adjust the binary search range based on validity until the maximum value is found.

### Code:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxValue(int n, int index, int maxSum) {
        int left = 1, right = maxSum;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = (left + right + 1) / 2;
            if (isValid(mid, n, index, maxSum)) {
                left = mid;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }

    private boolean isValid(int mid, int n, int index, int maxSum) {
        long sum = mid;
        
        // Sum for the left part
        if (index > 0) {
            if (index >= mid) {
                sum += (long)(mid - 1) * mid / 2; // full series sum 1 to mid-1
                sum += index - mid + 1; // add 1s for remaining parts
            } else {
                sum += (long)index * (2 * mid - index - 1) / 2; // truncated series sum
            }
        }

        // Sum for the right part
        if (n - index - 1 > 0) {
            int rightPart = n - index - 1;
            if (rightPart >= mid) {
                sum += (long)(mid - 1) * mid / 2; // full series sum 1 to mid-1
                sum += rightPart - mid + 1; // add 1s for remaining parts
            } else {
                sum += (long)rightPart * (2 * mid - rightPart - 1) / 2; // truncated series sum
            }
        }

        return sum <= maxSum;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Binary Search Complexity:** O(log(maxSum))
- **Validity Check Complexity:** O(1)

Thus, the total time complexity is approximately O(log(maxSum)), making it efficient for the given problem constraints.
