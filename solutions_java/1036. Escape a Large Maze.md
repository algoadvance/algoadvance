[Leetcode 1036. Escape a Large Maze](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1036)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D grid `blocked` of `m` pairs of integers where `blocked[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a blocked cell in the grid. The grid is infinite, meaning it stretches out indefinitely in all directions. You are also given two pairs of integers `source = [sx, sy]` and `target = [tx, ty]` representing the starting and ending cells. You need to determine if it is possible to reach the `target` from the `source` without moving into any of the blocked cells.

Return `true` if it is possible to reach the `target` from the `source` without landing on a blocked cell within a million moves; otherwise, return `false`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Dimensions and Limits:** Since the grid is infinite, should we consider optimizations based on practical movement limits?
2. **Boundary Cases:** How large can the blocked list be? What if `blocked` is empty?
3. **Movement Directions:** Are movements restricted to cardinal directions (up, down, left, right)?

## Strategy

1. **Minimum Path Check:** Given the problemâ€™s constraints, if a path is blocked, it will be due to an insufficient number of movements or due to an actual blocking configuration. Considering a logical boundary to limit infinite grid evaluation.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) or DFS:** Utilize BFS for shortest path problems but with maximum movement constraints taken into account.
3. **Visited and Blocking:** Track visited cells and ensure steps do not exceed practical max boundary based on blocked cells.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class EscapeLargeMaze {
    private static final int BOUNDARY_LIMIT = 1000000;  // Impractical movement cap

    public boolean isEscapePossible(int[][] blocked, int[] source, int[] target) {
        Set<String> blockedSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (int[] block : blocked) {
            blockedSet.add(block[0] + "," + block[1]);
        }

        return bfsCheck(source, target, blockedSet) && bfsCheck(target, source, blockedSet);
    }

    private boolean bfsCheck(int[] start, int[] end, Set<String> blockedSet) {
        Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(start);

        int[][] directions = new int[][]{{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}};
        visited.add(start[0] + "," + start[1]);

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] current = queue.poll();
            int x = current[0], y = current[1];

            for (int[] dir : directions) {
                int nextX = x + dir[0];
                int nextY = y + dir[1];

                String key = nextX + "," + nextY;
                if (nextX == end[0] && nextY == end[1]) return true;
                if (nextX < 0 || nextY < 0 || nextX >= BOUNDARY_LIMIT || nextY >= BOUNDARY_LIMIT) continue;
                if (!blockedSet.contains(key) && !visited.contains(key)) {
                    visited.add(key);
                    queue.offer(new int[]{nextX, nextY});
                }
            }

            if (visited.size() > 20000) return true;  // Consider pseudo-infinite clear area
        }
        return false;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        EscapeLargeMaze solution = new EscapeLargeMaze();

        int[][] blocked = {{0,1},{1,0}};
        int[] source = {0,0};
        int[] target = {0,2};

        System.out.println(solution.isEscapePossible(blocked, source, target));  // Expected output: true
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Worst-case time complexity:** O(B + N) - where `B` represents the number of blocked cells and `N` signifies navigable ones until the escape is deemed possible or exhausted.
- **Space Complexity:** O(B) - Primarily due to storage in hash sets and queues tracking visited and blocked states.
