[Leetcode 3030. Find the Grid of Region Average](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3030)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` grid of integers `grid` and a positive integer `k`. The grid generates a new grid `res` where each element in `res` is the average (rounded down to the nearest integer) of the `k x k` subgrid starting at that element in `grid`.

    Example:
    
    Input: grid = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], k = 2
    Output: [[3, 4], [7, 8]]

## Clarifying Questions

1. What should we return if `k` is larger than the grid's dimensions?
   - Generally, if `k` is larger than the grid, you can't form a `k x k` subgrid, so return an empty grid or handle it gracefully.
   
2. Should the averaging be integer division (floor division)?
   - Yes, round down to the nearest integer after averaging.

3. What are the possible constraints on the grid dimensions and `k` value?
   - Constraints would typically be between 1 and 1000 for `m`, `n`, and `k`.

## Strategy

1. **Initial Validation:** Check if `k` is larger than any of the grid dimensions (`m` or `n`). If it is, return an empty grid.
2. **Sliding Window Summation:** Use a sliding window approach to calculate the sum of each `k x k` subgrid.
3. **Calculate Average:** For each valid top-left corner of `k x k` subgrid, calculate the average and populate the resulting grid.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int[][] averageGrid(int[][] grid, int k) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        
        if (k > m || k > n) return new int[0][0];
        
        int[][] result = new int[m - k + 1][n - k + 1];
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= m - k; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= n - k; j++) {
                int sum = 0;
                
                for (int p = i; p < i + k; p++) {
                    for (int q = j; q < j + k; q++) {
                        sum += grid[p][q];
                    }
                }
                
                int avg = sum / (k * k);
                result[i][j] = avg;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The algorithm iterates over each possible top-left corner of a `k x k` subgrid `(m - k + 1) * (n - k + 1)` times. For each such corner, it calculates the sum of a `k x k` subgrid which takes `O(k^2)` time.
  
  Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O((m - k + 1) * (n - k + 1) * k^2)`.

- **Space Complexity:** 
  - The additional space used is for the result grid, which is of size `(m - k + 1) * (n - k + 1)`, i.e., `O((m - k + 1) * (n - k + 1))`. 
  - There are no other significant space complexities involved aside from standard variable storage.

This approach ensures that each element in the resultant grid is properly computed as the average of the appropriate `k x k` subgrid, rounded down.
