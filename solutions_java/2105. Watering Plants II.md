[Leetcode 2105. Watering Plants II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2105)
### Problem Statement
You have a long row of plants in a garden. Each plant needs a specific amount of water. You have two workers who can water the plants, starting from the two ends of the row (the first worker from the left end and the second worker from the right end). 

Each worker carries a watering can that can hold a certain amount of water. When a worker waters a plant, the amount of water in the can is reduced by the amount needed by that plant. If the can doesn't have enough water to water the next plant, the worker must refill the can to its full capacity by returning to the start position.

Your task is to determine the minimum number of times the workers must refill their watering cans to water all the plants.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Does the refill count include the initial fill?**
   - Answer: No, the initial fill of the watering can doesn't count as a refill.
2. **When a worker relocates to the other end, is there any delay or cost?**
   - Answer: We won't consider the movement cost. We only care about refills.
3. **What is the expected output?**
   - Answer: The expected output is a single integer representing the total number of refills both workers made.
4. **Can the plants array be empty, or are there constraints?**
   - Answer: No, the plants array won't be empty, and each plant needs at least some amount of water.

### Strategy
1. We'll use two pointers to simulate the two workers:
   - One pointer starts from the left, and the other starts from the right.
2. We'll keep track of the current water capacity for each worker.
3. As we iterate through the plants, we'll decrement the current capacity of each worker according to the plant's water requirement.
4. If a worker can't water the next plant due to insufficient water, they will refill, and we will increase the refill count.
5. This process continues until both pointers meet or cross each other, meaning all plants have been watered.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of plants. This is because each plant is visited only once by either worker.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minimumRefill(int[] plants, int capacityA, int capacityB) {
        // Initialize refills and the starting capacities
        int refills = 0;
        int currentA = capacityA;
        int currentB = capacityB;
        
        int left = 0;
        int right = plants.length - 1;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            if (left == right) {
                // If both pointers meet at the same plant
                if (currentA >= currentB) {
                    if (currentA < plants[left]) refills++;
                } else {
                    if (currentB < plants[left]) refills++;
                }
                break;  // single plant scenario handled
            } else {
                // Watering with worker A
                if (currentA < plants[left]) {
                    currentA = capacityA;  // refill
                    refills++;
                }
                currentA -= plants[left];
                left++;

                // Watering with worker B
                if (currentB < plants[right]) {
                    currentB = capacityB;  // refill
                    refills++;
                }
                currentB -= plants[right];
                right--;
            }
        }
        
        return refills;
    }
}
```

The provided code initializes the necessary variables and iterates through the plants using two pointers to simulate the workers. The logic correctly handles refilling whenever necessary and counts the refills accurately. Run this method with required input, and it will return the minimum number of refills needed.
