[Leetcode 2849. Determine if a Cell Is Reachable at a Given Time](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2849)
Certainly! Below is a sectioned solution to the given problem.

### Problem Statement:
You need to determine if a cell in a grid is reachable from a starting position within a given time limit. The grid is infinite and each move takes exactly 1 unit of time. You can move up, down, left, or right from any cell.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Details**:
   - What is the starting position (x1, y1)?
   - What is the target position (x2, y2)?
   - What is the time limit (t)?

2. **Constraints**:
   - Are the coordinates and time limit guaranteed to be non-negative integers?
   - Is there a possibility of obstacles or is the grid completely open?

### Strategy:
To determine if a cell is reachable within a given time, follow these steps:
1. Calculate the Manhattan distance between the starting cell (x1, y1) and the target cell (x2, y2):
   \[
   \text{Manhattan Distance} = |x2 - x1| + |y2 - y1|
   \]
2. Compare this Manhattan distance to the given time limit (t):
   - If the Manhattan distance is less than or equal to the time limit, it suggests that the position is reachable. 
   - Check the parity (even or odd) of the Manhattan distance and time limit. If both are of the same parity, the target cell is reachable; otherwise, it isn't. This is because you can only end up at a cell with the same parity of steps as the distance when it matches the parity of the time limit.

### Code:

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean isReachableWithinTime(int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2, int t) {
        // Calculate the Manhattan distance
        int manhattanDistance = Math.abs(x2 - x1) + Math.abs(y2 - y1);
        
        // Check if the cell is reachable within the time limit
        if (manhattanDistance > t) {
            return false; // Not enough time to reach the cell
        }
        
        // Check parity condition
        return (manhattanDistance % 2 == t % 2);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        
        // Example test cases
        System.out.println(sol.isReachableWithinTime(0, 0, 3, 4, 10)); // true
        System.out.println(sol.isReachableWithinTime(0, 0, 3, 4, 7)); // false
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(1)\) because:
- The computation of the Manhattan distance and the parity checks involve a constant number of arithmetic operations.
- There are no loops or recursive calls, making these operations constant in time.

This approach has optimal efficiency, clearly addressing the problem constraints and requirements.
