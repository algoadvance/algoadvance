[Leetcode 1937. Maximum Number of Points with Cost](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1937)
## Problem Statement

**1937. Maximum Number of Points with Cost**

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `points` (0-indexed). Starting with `0` points, you want to maximize the number of points you can get by picking cells in the matrix according to the following rules:

1. You can only start picking cells from the first row.
2. You choose any cell in the current row and add the points in the cell to your score.
3. From the next row, you can only pick a cell in the column if the distance from the last picked cell is â‰¤ 1. The distance is defined as the absolute difference between the column indices of the cells.
4. You may pick as many cells as you can.

Return `the maximum number of points` you can achieve.

Example:
``` 
Input: points = [
    [1,2,3],
    [1,5,1],
    [3,1,1]
]
Output: 9
Explanation:
The path with the maximum points is (points[0][2] + points[1][1] + points[2][0]) = 3 + 5 + 1 = 9.
``` 

## Clarifying Questions

1. What are the constraints on the dimensions of the matrix `points`?
   - The matrix `points` will have dimensions such that `1 <= m, n <= 1000`.
2. What are the constraints on the values within the matrix `points`?
   - Each value in the matrix `points` will be between `1` and `10^5`.

## Strategy

1. We will use Dynamic Programming (DP) to solve the problem.
2. Let `dp[i][j]` represent the maximum points we can have when picking a cell in row `i` and column `j`.
3. Initialize `dp[0][j] = points[0][j]` for all `j` in the first row.
4. For each subsequent row:
   - Calculate the maximum possible points we can get if we come from the previous row without violating the distance constraint.
   - Maintain two arrays: `left_max` and `right_max` to help calculate the maximum points with constraints efficiently.
5. The final answer will be the maximum value in the last row of the `dp` table.

## Implementation

Here's the Java code to implement the above strategy:

```java
public class Solution {
    public long maxPoints(int[][] points) {
        int m = points.length;
        int n = points[0].length;
        long[][] dp = new long[m][n];

        // Initialize the first row of `dp`
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            dp[0][j] = points[0][j];
        }

        // Process each row
        for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) {
            long[] leftMax = new long[n];
            long[] rightMax = new long[n];

            // Fill the leftMax array
            leftMax[0] = dp[i-1][0];
            for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
                leftMax[j] = Math.max(leftMax[j-1], dp[i-1][j] + j);
            }

            // Fill the rightMax array
            rightMax[n-1] = dp[i-1][n-1] - (n-1);
            for (int j = n-2; j >= 0; --j) {
                rightMax[j] = Math.max(rightMax[j+1], dp[i-1][j] - j);
            }

            // Fill the dp array for the current row based on leftMax and rightMax
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                dp[i][j] = points[i][j] + Math.max(leftMax[j] - j, rightMax[j] + j);
            }
        }

        // The answer is the maximum value in the last row of `dp`
        long maxPoints = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
            maxPoints = Math.max(maxPoints, dp[m-1][j]);
        }

        return maxPoints;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the matrix.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(m * n)` for the `dp` array. The auxiliary arrays `leftMax` and `rightMax` use `O(n)` additional space.

This method ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum points while preserving the constraints mentioned.
