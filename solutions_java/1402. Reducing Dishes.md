[Leetcode 1402. Reducing Dishes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1402)
### Problem Statement

You have a list of dishes. Each dish has a satisfaction value associated with it. The chef wants to prepare dishes in a way that maximizes the sum of `like-time` coefficient, which is calculated as follows:

If the chef prepares a dish with satisfaction `s[i]` at time `t`, then the `like-time` coefficient will be `t * s[i]`. The chef can decide which dishes to prepare and in what order. He can even decide to not prepare any dishes at all. Return the maximum sum of `like-time` coefficient that the chef can achieve.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What range can the satisfaction values take?**
   - Satisfaction values can be both positive and negative.

2. **What constraints should I be aware of?**
   - The length of the satisfaction array is between 1 and 500.
   - The satisfaction value is between -10^3 and 10^3.

3. **Is the order of preparing dishes significant?**
   - Yes, the order determines the `time` in `t * s[i]`.

4. **Can we assume that the input will always be valid and non-empty?**
   - Yes, based on the constraints.

5. **Is it allowed to use built-in sorting methods?**
   - Yes, using built-in sorting methods is allowed.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Satisfaction Array**: Start by sorting the satisfaction array in descending order. Why descending? Because the more satisfied we are with a dish, the sooner we want to cook it to maximize the `like-time` coefficient.
   
2. **Calculate the Maximum `like-time` Coefficient**:
   - Initialize `total` and `maxSatisfaction` to zero. `total` will keep the cumulative sum of satisfaction values as we iterate. `maxSatisfaction` will keep the running sum of the `like-time` coefficients.
   - Iterate through the sorted satisfaction list. Add the current satisfaction to `total`. If `total` is positive, it means adding this dish increases the overall satisfaction metrics.
   - Update the `maxSatisfaction` accordingly.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxSatisfaction(int[] satisfaction) {
        // Sort the satisfaction array in descending order
        Arrays.sort(satisfaction);
        int n = satisfaction.length;
        
        // Initialize variables
        int total = 0;
        int maxSatisfaction = 0;

        // Traverse the array from end to start to maximize total
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            // Calculate new total
            total += satisfaction[i];
            
            // If total is positive, add it to maxSatisfaction
            if (total > 0) {
                maxSatisfaction += total;
            }
        }
        
        return maxSatisfaction;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] satisfaction = {-1, -8, 0, 5, -9};
        System.out.println(sol.maxSatisfaction(satisfaction));  // Output: 14
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the array**: `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of dishes.
- **Iterating through the sorted array**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of dishes.
- **Overall Time Complexity**: `O(n log n)`, which is dominated by the sorting step.

### Explanation

1. **Sorting**: We sort the array in ascending order and iterate through the array from the end.
2. **Cumulative Calculation**: By maintaining a running total of the satisfaction and checking if adding the current satisfaction increases the overall satisfaction, we can determine the optimal set of dishes. 

This solution ensures that we maximize the `like-time` coefficient effectively and efficiently.
