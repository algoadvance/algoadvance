[Leetcode 2835. Minimum Operations to Form Subsequence With Target Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2835)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers and an integer `target`, you want to form a subsequence of `nums` which sums to the `target`. Return the minimum number of operations needed to form such a subsequence. In one operation, you can pick any two integers in the subsequence and combine them into a single integer by summing them up.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain duplicate elements?**
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicate elements.

2. **Is there always a solution?**
   - No, if it is not possible to form the target using the given `nums`, the problem should return -1.

3. **What values can `nums` and `target` take?**
   - All elements in `nums` and the `target` are positive integers.

4. **Is sorting allowed?**
   - Yes, sorting is allowed, if needed to optimize the solution.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Array:** Start by sorting `nums` in decreasing order so that we can attempt to form the target sum by taking the largest available numbers first.

2. **Greedy Approach:** Use a greedy approach to pick numbers from the sorted list, summing them up until the sum meets or exceeds `target`.

3. **Count Operations:** Track the number of operations required to merge integers during this process.

4. **Check Feasibility:** If itâ€™s possible to meet or exceed `target`, return the count of operations, otherwise return -1.

### Code

Below is the Java implementation for the above strategy.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MinimumOperationsToFormSubsequence {

    public int minOperations(int[] nums, int target) {
        Arrays.sort(nums); // Sort the array in ascending order
        int sum = 0;
        int operations = 0;
        int n = nums.length;

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (sum >= target) {
                return operations; // Early exit if we already meet or exceed the target
            }
            sum += nums[i]; // Add the largest remaining number
            operations++; // Increment the operations count
        }

        return sum >= target ? operations : -1; // Final check if we meet or exceed the target
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumOperationsToFormSubsequence solution = new MinimumOperationsToFormSubsequence();
        int[] nums = {3, 1, 4, 2, 2};
        int target = 6;
        System.out.println(solution.minOperations(nums, target)); // Output example: 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **Traversal:** `O(n)` to traverse through the sorted elements.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)` dominated by the sorting step. This solution is efficient given the constraints and should work well for most inputs within typical constraint limits.
