[Leetcode 2. Add Two Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2)
### Problem Statement

This problem is from LeetCode, problem number 2, titled "Add Two Numbers". The task is to add two numbers represented by two linked lists. Each node in the linked lists contains a single digit and the digits are stored in reverse order, meaning the 1's digit is at the head of the list. Your goal is to return the sum as a linked list in the same reverse order format.

**Example:**

Input: (2 -> 4 -> 3) + (5 -> 6 -> 4)  
Output: 7 -> 0 -> 8

Explanation: 342 + 465 = 807.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - Is there a limit to the length of the linked lists? 
    - Will the linked lists be of the same length?
    - Can the input linked list contain negative numbers?

2. **Output Format:**
    - Should the resulting linked list be created in the same reverse order format?

3. **Edge Cases:**
    - What should be done if one of the linked lists is empty?
    - How should carry over be handled in the case of summing digits?

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a dummy node to act as the starting point of the result linked list.
   - Use a variable to keep track of the carry generated during the addition.

2. **Traversal and Addition:**
   - Traverse both linked lists simultaneously.
   - Add corresponding nodes and include any carry from the previous addition.
   - Compute the new carry for the next digits addition.

3. **Check for Remaining Carry:**
   - After finishing the traversal, if there's a leftover carry, append it to the result list.

4. **Result Construction:**
   - The dummy node's next pointer will point to our result linked list.

### Code

Here is the Java implementation:

```java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode() {}
    ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
    ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
}

public class Solution {
    public ListNode addTwoNumbers(ListNode l1, ListNode l2) {
        ListNode dummyHead = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode current = dummyHead;
        int carry = 0;
        
        while (l1 != null || l2 != null) {
            int l1Val = (l1 != null) ? l1.val : 0;
            int l2Val = (l2 != null) ? l2.val : 0;
            int sum = l1Val + l2Val + carry;
            
            carry = sum / 10;
            int newDigit = sum % 10;
            current.next = new ListNode(newDigit);
            current = current.next;
            
            if (l1 != null) l1 = l1.next;
            if (l2 != null) l2 = l2.next;
        }
        
        if (carry > 0) {
            current.next = new ListNode(carry);
        }
        
        return dummyHead.next;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is **O(max(m, n))**, where \( m \) and \( n \) are the lengths of the two input linked lists. This is because we traverse both linked lists entirely, and the operations performed inside the loop (basic arithmetic and pointer moves) are constant time operations.

The space complexity, excluding the input and output space, is **O(max(m, n))** as well, since we create a new list that at most has the number of nodes equal to the longer of the two input lists, plus one additional node for a possible carry at the end.
