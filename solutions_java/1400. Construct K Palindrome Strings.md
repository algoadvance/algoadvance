### Problem Statement

1400. Construct K Palindrome Strings

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, you need to construct `k` non-empty palindrome strings using all the characters in `s`. Return `True` if you can use all the characters in the string to construct `k` palindrome strings, otherwise return `False`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the definition of a palindrome?**
   - A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward.

2. **What are the constraints on the input values?**
   - The length of `s` is between 1 and 10^5.
   - `k` is an integer between 1 and the length of `s`.

3. **What should be done if `k` exceeds the length of `s`?**
   - If `k` is greater than the length of `s`, it's impossible to create `k` non-empty palindromes; hence, the function should return `False`.

### Strategy

1. **Counting Character Frequencies**: First, count the frequency of each character in the string `s`.

2. **Odd Frequency Characters**: For forming a palindrome, the number of characters with odd frequencies is crucial. Specifically:
   - If the number of characters with odd frequencies is greater than `k`, itâ€™s impossible to form `k` palindromes since each such character requires a separate string to maintain the palindrome property.

3. **Compare Length and k**: Ensure that `k` does not exceed the length of the string, since you cannot form more non-empty strings than the characters available.

### Time Complexity

- **Character Frequency Count**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- **Odd Frequency Check**: O(1), since it is based on a constant 26 possible letters in the alphabet for counting odd frequencies.

The overall time complexity is **O(n)**.

### Code

Here is the Java implementation for the problem:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public boolean canConstruct(String s, int k) {
        if (k > s.length()) {
            return false;  // More palindromes than characters
        }

        int[] charCount = new int[26];
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            charCount[c - 'a']++;
        }

        int oddCount = 0;
        for (int count : charCount) {
            if (count % 2 != 0) {
                oddCount++;
            }
        }

        // The number of odd frequency characters should not exceed k
        return oddCount <= k;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();

        // Test cases
        System.out.println(solution.canConstruct("annabelle", 2)); // True
        System.out.println(solution.canConstruct("leetcode", 3));  // False
        System.out.println(solution.canConstruct("true", 4));      // True
        System.out.println(solution.canConstruct("yzyzyzyzyzyzyzy", 2)); // True
        System.out.println(solution.canConstruct("cr", 7));        // False
    }
}
```

This code first checks if `k` is greater than the length of `s`, as it's impossible to create `k` non-empty palindromes in that case. It then counts the characters and their frequencies, computes the number of characters with odd frequencies, and returns whether `oddCount` is less than or equal to `k`.
