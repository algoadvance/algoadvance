[Leetcode 3184. Count Pairs That Form a Complete Day I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3184)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `k`, find the number of unique pairs `(i, j)` (where `i < j`) such that the sum of `arr[i]` and `arr[j]` forms a "complete day". A "complete day" occurs when the sum of two elements is divisible by `k`.

### Example
- Input: `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, `k = 3`
- Output: `4`
- Explanation:
  - Pairs that form complete days: (1, 2), (1, 5), (2, 4), (3, 5)

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the array contain negative numbers or zero?**
   - Yes, the array can contain any integer values including zero and negative numbers.
   
2. **Can the array contain duplicate values?**
   - Yes, duplicate values are allowed.
   
3. **Are elements in the input array guaranteed to be finite?**
   - Yes, for practical purposes the input array will contain a finite number of integers.
   
4. **Is there any constraint on the size of the array?**
   - The array can be very large, so the solution needs to be efficient.

### Strategy
1. **Brute Force Approach:**
   - Iterate over all pairs of elements in the array.
   - Count pairs where the sum is divisible by `k`.
   - This approach has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\), which can be inefficient for large arrays.

2. **Optimized Approach using Remainder Buckets:**
   - Use an array or a HashMap to count the frequency of remainders when elements are divided by `k`.
   - Iterate through the array once to populate the remainder count.
   - For each pair of remainders `r` and `k-r`, compute the number of valid pairs.
   - Handle special cases where remainders are `0` or `k/2` (if `k` is even).

### Code
Here's the Java implementation of the optimized approach:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class CompleteDayPairs {
    public int countPairs(int[] arr, int k) {
        // Map to store remainder frequencies
        Map<Integer, Integer> remainderCount = new HashMap<>();

        // Populate the remainder count
        for (int num : arr) {
            int remainder = (num % k + k) % k; // Handle negative numbers
            remainderCount.put(remainder, remainderCount.getOrDefault(remainder, 0) + 1);
        }

        int count = 0;

        // Iterate through the remainder keys
        for (int rem : remainderCount.keySet()) {
            int complement = (k - rem) % k;

            // Special case: remainder 0 can only pair with itself
            if (rem == 0 || rem == complement) {
                int freq = remainderCount.get(rem);
                count += (freq * (freq - 1)) / 2; // Combination formula: nC2 = n*(n-1)/2
            } else if (rem > complement) {
                // Count pairs rem and complement
                count += remainderCount.get(rem) * remainderCount.getOrDefault(complement, 0);
            }
        }

        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CompleteDayPairs solution = new CompleteDayPairs();
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int k = 3;
        int result = solution.countPairs(arr, k);
        System.out.println("Number of pairs: " + result);  // Output: 4
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the input array. This is because we make a single pass through the array to populate the remainder counts and another pass through the keys of the map.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(k)\) for the remainder count map, which will at most store `k` different remainders.
