[Leetcode 2351. First Letter to Appear Twice](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2351)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters, return the first letter to appear twice.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: 
    - Can the string be empty?
    - Are there always at least two occurrences of one character?
  
    *Assumption*: The string is always non-empty and there is always at least one character that appears twice.

2. **Output Specifications**:
    - Should the output be in the form of a character that appears twice in the string?
  
   *Understood*: Yes, return the first character that appears twice.

### Strategy
1. **Using a Set** to Track Seen Characters:
    - Iterate over the characters of the string.
    - Maintain a set to keep track of characters that have been seen.
    - If a character is already in the set, it is the first character to appear twice.
    - Return the first character that meets the criterion.

2. **Time Complexity**:
    - The loop runs through the string once, and each insertion/check operation in the hash set is O(1).
    - Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, where n is the length of the string.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public char repeatedCharacter(String s) {
        Set<Character> seen = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (seen.contains(c)) {
                return c;  // Return the first character that appears twice
            }
            seen.add(c);
        }
        
        // As per problem constraints, we should never reach here.
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("No character appears twice in the given string");
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        
        // Example Test Cases
        System.out.println(solution.repeatedCharacter("abccbaacz"));  // Outputs 'c'
        System.out.println(solution.repeatedCharacter("abcddcba"));   // Outputs 'd'
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. We initialize an empty hash set to keep track of characters we have seen so far.
2. We iterate through each character in the string:
   - If the character is already in the set, it means we have encountered the character before, so we return it as the result.
   - Otherwise, we add the character to the set and continue checking the next characters.
3. The set ensures constant-time complexity operations for insertion and lookup.

### Time Complexity
- The code runs in linear time **O(n)** where n is the length of the input string.
- The space complexity is also **O(n)** in the worst case where all characters are unique before finding a duplicate.
