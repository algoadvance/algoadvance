[Leetcode 1604. Alert Using Same Key](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1604)
### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 1604: "Alert Using Same Key-Card Three or More Times in a One Hour Period"

We need to solve this coding problem where we have a list of key-card swipe records from employees in a building's secure system. Each record contains the employee's name and the time the card was used. The format of the time is `HH:MM` (00:00 to 23:59). If an employee uses the key-card three or more times within any one-hour period, we need to trigger an alert for that employee.

Return a list of unique employees that received an alert in lexicographical order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can an employee's swiping time records be out of order, or should we assume they are sorted?**
   
   Assume that the swipe times for each employee are not pre-sorted.

2. **What is the format of the input?**

   The input is a list of strings, where each string consists of `<name>` and `<time>` separated by a space.

3. **Can we assume that there is at least one swipe record for every employee?**

   Yes, since the problem states there are swipe records for employees.

4. **Is the output expected to be unique and lexicographically ordered?**

   Yes, the list of names should be unique and sorted in lexicographical order.

### Strategy

1. **Parse the Input:**
   - Separate the list into names and their corresponding times.
   
2. **Organize by Employee:**
   - Use a Map to group the swipe times for each employee.
   
3. **Sort the Times:**
   - For each employee, sort their swipe times.
   
4. **Check for Alerts:**
   - Slide over the sorted times and check if three or more swipes fall within any one-hour window.
   - If so, add the employeeâ€™s name to the alert list.
   
5. **Sort and Return the Result:**
   - Ensure the final list of alerted employees is unique and sorted lexicographically before returning.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<String> alertNames(String[] keyName, String[] keyTime) {
        Map<String, List<String>> employeeTimesMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Step 1: Parse input into a map of employee -> list of times
        for (int i = 0; i < keyName.length; i++) {
            employeeTimesMap.computeIfAbsent(keyName[i], k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(keyTime[i]);
        }
        
        List<String> alertedEmployees = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Step 2: For each employee, sort their times and check if they triggered an alert
        for (String name : employeeTimesMap.keySet()) {
            List<String> times = employeeTimesMap.get(name);
            Collections.sort(times);
            
            // Step 3: Convert times to minutes and check for alerts
            List<Integer> timesInMinutes = new ArrayList<>();
            for (String time : times) {
                timesInMinutes.add(convertToMinutes(time));
            }
            
            if (hasAlert(timesInMinutes)) {
                alertedEmployees.add(name);
            }
        }
        
        // Step 4: Sort the result list lexicographically
        Collections.sort(alertedEmployees);
        return alertedEmployees;
    }
    
    private int convertToMinutes(String time) {
        String[] parts = time.split(":");
        int hours = Integer.parseInt(parts[0]);
        int minutes = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]);
        return hours * 60 + minutes;
    }
    
    private boolean hasAlert(List<Integer> times) {
        for (int i = 2; i < times.size(); i++) {
            if (times.get(i) - times.get(i - 2) <= 60) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Parsing Input:**
   - O(N) where N is the number of swipe records.

2. **Sorting Times for each Employee:**
   - In the worst case, each employee has all N swipe records, making the sort O(N log N).

3. **Checking Alert Conditions:**
   - Checking in linear time O(N).

4. **Sorting the Final Result:**
   - O(M log M), where M is the number of unique employees.

Combining these, the overall time complexity is approximately O(N log N) due to the sorting steps.

### Summary

- Parse and organize the employee data.
- Sort the times for each employee.
- Check for three or more swipes within any one-hour window.
- Gather and sort the list of employees who received alerts, then return it.
