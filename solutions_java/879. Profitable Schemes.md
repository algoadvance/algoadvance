[Leetcode 879. Profitable Schemes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l879)
### Problem Statement

There is a group of `n` members, and a list of various profits and group sizes, which are required to achieve specific crimes. The `i-th` crime requires `group[i]` members to participate, and making a profit of `profit[i]`.

Return the number of different schemes that can be chosen such that the profit is at least `minProfit`. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Constraints**:
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `0 <= minProfit <= 100`
- `1 <= group.length == profit.length <= 100`
- `1 <= group[i] <= 100`
- `0 <= profit[i] <= 100`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the same crime be chosen multiple times?** No, each crime can be chosen at most once.
2. **What is the maximum possible value of profit[i] and group[i]?** Both are 100 as per the constraints.
3. **Do we need to consider the order in which schemes are chosen?** No, the order doesnâ€™t matter.

### Strategy

This is a variation of the knapsack problem. We will use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways to form profitable schemes. The state of the DP array will represent the count of schemes.

- Define a `dp[g][p]` array where `dp[g][p]` represents the number of ways to choose schemes with at most `g` members and at least `p` profit.
- Initialize `dp[0][0]` to `1` since there is exactly one way to achieve zero profit with zero members, which is to choose no crimes.
- Iterate over each crime, and for each `group[i]` and `profit[i]`, update the `dp` array in reverse order to avoid recomputations in the same iteration.

### Time Complexity

The task involves iterating over the list of crimes and for each crime, iterating over possible group sizes and profits. Therefore, the time complexity is O(n * minProfit * m * m), where `m` is the length of `group`.

### Code

Here's a Java implementation following the above strategy:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class ProfitableSchemes {
    public int profitableSchemes(int n, int minProfit, int[] group, int[] profit) {
        int MOD = 1_000_000_007;
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][minProfit + 1];
        dp[0][0] = 1;  // Base case: one way to achieve 0 profit with 0 people

        // Iterate over each crime
        for (int k = 0; k < group.length; k++) {
            int members = group[k];
            int earnedProfit = profit[k];
            
            // We should process from back to front to avoid overwriting the dp values too early
            for (int g = n; g >= members; g--) {
                for (int p = minProfit; p >= 0; p--) {
                    int newProfit = Math.min(minProfit, p + earnedProfit);
                    dp[g][newProfit] = (dp[g][newProfit] + dp[g - members][p]) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }

        // Sum up all the schemes that achieve at least 'minProfit' profit
        int result = 0;
        for (int g = 0; g <= n; g++) {
            result = (result + dp[g][minProfit]) % MOD;
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ProfitableSchemes ps = new ProfitableSchemes();
        int n = 5;
        int minProfit = 3;
        int[] group = {2, 2};
        int[] profit = {2, 3};
        System.out.println(ps.profitableSchemes(n, minProfit, group, profit));  // Output: 2
    }
}
```

This code correctly populates the `dp` array to account for all possible combinations of group members and profits, ensuring that the number of ways to achieve at least the minimum profit using up to `n` members is calculated accurately.
