[Leetcode 2141. Maximum Running Time of N Computers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2141)
### Problem Statement

Given `n` computers and an array `batteries` where `batteries[i]` is the power of the i-th battery, return the maximum number of minutes that you can run all the `n` computers simultaneously.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the power of the batteries be zero?**
   - Each element in `batteries` can be zero.

2. **Do we have any constraints on the number of batteries?**
   - The length of `batteries` is not specified but can be assumed to be `>= n` since we need at least one battery per computer.

3. **Can we assume that all integers in `batteries` and the target time are non-negative?**
   - Yes, all power amounts in `batteries` are non-negative integers.

### Code

The approach to solve this problem involves using a binary search on the possible running time. We check if it's feasible to run all `n` computers for a given amount of time, adjusting the feasible range based on the result.

```java
public class Solution {
    public long maxRunTime(int n, int[] batteries) {
        long totalPower = 0;
        for (int battery : batteries) {
            totalPower += battery;
        }

        long left = 1, right = totalPower / n;

        while (left < right) {
            long mid = (right + left + 1) / 2;
            if (canRunAllComputers(batteries, n, mid)) {
                left = mid;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        return left;
    }

    private boolean canRunAllComputers(int[] batteries, int n, long runTime) {
        long totalTimeAvailable = 0;
        for (int battery : batteries) {
            totalTimeAvailable += Math.min(battery, runTime);
        }
        return totalTimeAvailable >= runTime * n;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.maxRunTime(2, new int[]{3, 3, 3})); // Output: 4
        System.out.println(sol.maxRunTime(3, new int[]{1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1})); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Compute Total Power**: Calculate the sum of all battery powers. This gives the upper bound of our binary search.
  
2. **Binary Search on Time**: Use binary search to find the maximum running time. The left bound starts at 1 (minimum possible time) and the right bound starts at the total power divided by `n` (maximum average time if the power were evenly distributed).

3. **Feasibility Check**: For each midpoint in the binary search (`mid`), check if all `n` computers can run for `mid` minutes by comparing the sum of the minimum power contributions from each battery against `n * mid`.

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search**: The binary search operates over a range from 1 to the sum of all powers divided by `n`, which roughly gives us \(O(\log(\text{sum} / n))\).
- **Feasibility Check**: For each midpoint check, we iterate through all batteries to calculate total available power, which takes \(O(m)\), where `m` is the number of batteries.

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(m \log(\text{sum} / n))\).
