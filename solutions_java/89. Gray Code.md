[Leetcode 89. Gray Code](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l89)
## Problem Statement

The Gray code is a binary numeral system where two successive values differ in only one bit.

Given an integer `n` representing the total number of bits in the code, return any sequence of Gray code. A Gray code sequence must begin with 0.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 2
Output: [0,1,3,2]
Explanation:
0 - 00
1 - 01
3 - 11
2 - 10
[0,1,3,2] is a Gray code sequence that meets the requirement for n = 2. Another valid sequence is [0,2,3,1].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 1
Output: [0,1]
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= n <= 16`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is Gray code?**
   - Gray code is a binary numeral system in which two successive values differ only in one bit.

2. **Do we need to generate all possible sequences of Gray code?**
   - No, we only need to generate one valid sequence.

3. **What should the output format be?**
   - The output should be a list of integers representing the Gray code sequence.

## Strategy
1. **Understanding Gray Code Generation:**
   - Gray code can be generated using a known algorithm that involves bit manipulation.
   - For a given integer `i`, its Gray code can be obtained by `G(i) = i ^ (i >> 1)`, where `^` denotes the bitwise XOR operator, and `>>` denotes the right shift operator.
   
2. **Building the Sequence:**
   - Initialize an empty list to store the Gray code sequence.
   - Loop through numbers from `0` to `2^n - 1`, and for each number, apply the Gray code transformation `i ^ (i >> 1)`.
   - Append the transformed result to the list.

3. **Returning the Sequence:**
   - Return the constructed list as the result.

## Code
```java
import java.util.*;

public class GrayCode {
    public List<Integer> grayCode(int n) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int numberOfGrayCodes = 1 << n; // 2^n
        for (int i = 0; i < numberOfGrayCodes; i++) {
            result.add(i ^ (i >> 1));
        }
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        GrayCode gc = new GrayCode();
        System.out.println(gc.grayCode(2));  // Output: [0, 1, 3, 2]
        System.out.println(gc.grayCode(1));  // Output: [0, 1]
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(2^n)` where `n` is the number of bits, since we generate `2^n` Gray code numbers.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(2^n)` for storing the result list which includes all the generated Gray codes.

By following this strategy and code, you can generate a valid sequence of Gray code for any integer `n` within the given constraints.
