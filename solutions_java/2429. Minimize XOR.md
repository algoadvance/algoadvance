[Leetcode 2429. Minimize XOR](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2429)
## Problem Statement

You are given two positive integers `num1` and `num2`. Find the integer `x` such that:

- `0 <= x <= 10^9`
- The XOR of `x` and `num1` is minimized.
- The number of 1-bits in the binary representation of `x` is equal to the number of 1-bits in the binary representation of `num2`.

Return the integer `x`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are `num1` and `num2` always guaranteed to be in the range `1 ≤ num1, num2 ≤ 10^9`?**
   - Yes, both numbers are guaranteed to be positive integers up to \(10^9\).

2. **Is there a specific constraint on the time and space complexity?**
   - Aim for an efficient solution in terms of time and space complexity.

3. **Can `x` be equal to `num1` or `num2`?**
   - Yes, as long as it meets the required conditions.

## Strategy

1. **Understanding XOR Minimization:**
   - To minimize the XOR result between `x` and `num1`, `x` should have bits that match `num1` as closely as possible, especially in the higher significant bits.

2. **Matching 1-bits Count:**
   - The number of 1-bits in `x` should match the number of 1-bits in `num2`.

### Steps to Solve:

1. **Count 1-bits in both `num1` and `num2`:**
   - Use `Integer.bitCount()` to get the number of 1-bits in both `num1` and `num2`.

2. **Build x from `num1`:**
   - Start with `x = 0`.
   - Use bits of `num1` to set `x`, starting with the most significant bits, until the required number of 1-bits is achieved.

3. **Adjust remaining 1-bits if needed:**
   - If after using bits from `num1`, the number of 1-bits in `x` is less than required, set the remaining bits from the least significant end.

## Code

```java
public class MinimizeXOR {
    public int minimizeXor(int num1, int num2) {
        // Get the number of 1-bits in num2
        int count1BitsNum2 = Integer.bitCount(num2);
        
        // Create an array to store positions of 1-bits in num1
        int[] positions = new int[32];
        int index = 0;
        
        // Get the number of 1-bits in num1 and their positions
        int count1BitsNum1 = Integer.bitCount(num1);
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            if ((num1 & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                positions[index++] = i;
            }
        }
        
        // Create x
        int x = 0;
        
        // Fill x with bits from num1 as much as needed
        int bitPositionIndex = 0;
        while (count1BitsNum2 > 0 && bitPositionIndex < count1BitsNum1) {
            x |= (1 << positions[bitPositionIndex++]);
            count1BitsNum2--;
        }
        
        // If there are remaining 1-bits, set them from the least significant end
        for (int i = 0; count1BitsNum2 > 0 && i < 32; i++) {
            if ((x & (1 << i)) == 0) {
                x |= (1 << i);
                count1BitsNum2--;
            }
        }
        
        return x;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Counting 1-bits: \( O(1) \) using `Integer.bitCount()` which operates in constant time.
- Populating positions: \( O(1) \), up to a maximum of 32 bits.
- Building `x`: \( O(1) \), constrained by up to 32 bits.

Overall time complexity is \( O(1) \), making this solution very efficient.
