[Leetcode 1959. Minimum Total Space Wasted With K Resizing Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1959)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` representing the sizes of arrays and an integer `k`, you need to divide this array into `k+1` non-empty subarrays such that the total space wasted is minimized.

The waste of space for a subarray is defined as the difference between the maximum size in the subarray and the size of all elements in the subarray summed up. Your task is to return the minimum total space wasted with at most `k` resizing operations over all possible divisions of the array `nums`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for `nums` and `k`?**
   - The size of the array and `k` can help in determining the possible size of the solution.
   
2. **Can elements in `nums` be negative?**
   - This would affect how you define waste, but usually array sizes are non-negative.

3. **Could `k` be larger than the size of `nums`?**
   - We need to check if `k` is within the logical bounds since dividing the array in more parts than its length needs special handling.

Assuming: `nums` is a list of non-negative integers, and `1 <= nums.length <= 200` and `0 <= k < nums.length`.

## Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Use a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum wasted space for subarrays `nums[0]` to `nums[i]` with `j` resizing operations.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize `dp[i][0]` where there is no resizing allowed.

3. **Recurrence Relation:**
   - Update the DP table by considering all possible subarrays within the allowed resizing operations.

4. **Base Case:**
   - If `k == 0`, there are no resizing operations allowed, so the total wasted space is just calculated based on a single maximum for the full array.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minSpaceWastedKResizing(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n][k + 1];
        
        for (int[] row : dp) {
            Arrays.fill(row, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int maxInSubarray = nums[i];
            int sumInSubarray = nums[i];
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                maxInSubarray = Math.max(maxInSubarray, nums[j]);
                sumInSubarray += nums[j];
                if (i == 0) {
                    dp[j][0] = maxInSubarray * (j+1) - sumInSubarray;
                } else {
                    for (int l = 0; l <= k; l++) {
                        if (dp[i-1][l] != Integer.MAX_VALUE && l < k) {
                            dp[j][l+1] = Math.min(dp[j][l+1], dp[i-1][l] + (maxInSubarray * (j-i+1) - (sumInSubarray - nums[i])));
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        int result = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i <= k; i++) {
            result = Math.min(result, dp[n-1][i]);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Outer Loop:** `O(n)` for iterating through the array.
- **Inner Loop:** `O(n)` for calculating subarray parameters.
- **DP Updates:** `O(n*k)` to look at possible resizing operations.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n^3 * k)` which can be quite expensive for large `n`, but should be manageable for the given constraint `1 <= nums.length <= 200`. This is an acceptable complexity for interview problems that involve dynamic programming with combined nested loops.
