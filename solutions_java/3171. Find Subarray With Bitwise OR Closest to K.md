[Leetcode 3171. Find Subarray With Bitwise OR Closest to K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3171)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `arr` and an integer `K`. The task is to find a subarray whose bitwise OR is closest to `K`. The problem can be broken down as:
- Find the simplest subarray `subarr` such that the absolute difference `|bitwiseOR(subarr) - K|` is minimized.
- A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be the output if there are multiple subarrays with the same minimal difference?**
   - Should we return any one of them or focus on the smallest length subarray?
2. **Is there a maximum limit to the length of the array?**
3. **Can the elements of the array be negative?**
   - This affects whether itâ€™s valid to use typical bitwise operations on the elements.
4. **Do we need to return the actual subarray or just the minimal difference?**

### Assumptions
1. Multiple subarrays with the same minimal difference: We'll return the one that appears first.
2. Elements are all non-negative integers.
3. The length of the array would be reasonable for a solution with a quadratic complexity.
4. We will print the minimal difference and the corresponding subarray.

### Strategy
To solve this problem effectively:
1. Use nested loops to evaluate the bitwise OR of all possible subarrays.
2. Track the subarray which gives the minimum absolute difference with `K`.
3. Keep track of the subarray bounds for the result.

```java
public class SubarrayWithBitwiseORClosestToK {
    public static int[] findSubarrayWithBitwiseORClosestToK(int[] arr, int K) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int start = 0, end = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int orResult = 0;
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                orResult |= arr[j];
                int diff = Math.abs(orResult - K);
                if (diff < minDiff) {
                    minDiff = diff;
                    start = i;
                    end = j;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Prepare the result subarray
        int[] result = new int[end - start + 1];
        System.arraycopy(arr, start, result, 0, end - start + 1);
        
        System.out.println("The subarray with bitwise OR closest to " + K + " is: " + java.util.Arrays.toString(result));
        System.out.println("The minimal difference is: " + minDiff);
        
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 3, 5, 6};
        int K = 8;
        findSubarrayWithBitwiseORClosestToK(arr, K);
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Code

1. **Outer and Inner Loop**:
   - The outer loop starts the subarray at each `i`.
   - The inner loop expands the subarray to each `j`, calculating the bitwise OR of the subarray from `i` to `j`.

2. **Bitwise OR Calculation**:
   - `orResult |= arr[j]` accumulates the bitwise OR of the current subarray.
   - Calculate the difference `diff` between `orResult` and `K`.

3. **Tracking Minimal Difference**:
   - Update `minDiff`, `start`, and `end` if the current difference is smaller than `minDiff`.

4. **Result Preparation**:
   - Copy the elements from the original array to the result subarray using `System.arraycopy`.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is `O(N^2)` where `N` is the length of the array. This is because we are using nested loops, each potentially iterating up to `N` elements.
  
### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is `O(N)` for storing the result subarray. The auxiliary space for computation is `O(1)`.

This approach ensures we find the closest bitwise OR to `K` with a clear and understandable method.
