[Leetcode 2382. Maximum Segment Sum After Removals](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2382)
Sure, I will help you solve the problem with a clear and systematic approach.

### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums`, and an array `removeQueries` where each element in `removeQueries` represents the index to be removed from `nums` in sequence. After each removal, you should report the maximum segment sum of the segments in the array (where a segment is a continuous sequence of numbers that hasn't been removed).

You need to return a list of integers where the i-th element of the list is the maximum segment sum after the i-th removal.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the constraints on the size of the `nums` and `removeQueries` arrays?
   - What values can the elements of `nums` possess?

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Should the result account for the initial state (before any removals)? Or should it start from the state after the first removal?

### Strategy

1. **Data Structures:**
   - We will use a data structure that supports efficient merging of segments and querying the maximum sum of a current collection of segments. A Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) combined with some auxiliary arrays for sum and max maintenance should suffice.

2. **Steps:**
   - Start with an array of the same size as `nums`, initially filled with `nums` themselves.
   - Remove elements one by one according to `removeQueries` and maintain segments efficiently.
   - After each removal, compute the maximum segment sum.

### Code
Let's translate the above strategy into code.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<Long> maximumSegmentSum(int[] nums, int[] removeQueries) {
        int n = nums.length;
        List<Long> result = new ArrayList<>();
        long[] sums = new long[n]; // Array to store segment sums
        boolean[] removed = new boolean[n]; // Array to track removed indices
        int[] parent = new int[n]; // Union-Find parent array
        long[] segmentSum = new long[n]; // Sum of the segment where each index belongs
        long maxSum = 0;

        // Initialize Union-Find structure
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            parent[i] = i;
        }

        // Function to find root using path compression
        int find(int i) {
            if (parent[i] != i) {
                parent[i] = find(parent[i]);
            }
            return parent[i];
        }

        // Function to union two segments
        void union(int i, int j) {
            int rootI = find(i);
            int rootJ = find(j);
            if (rootI != rootJ) {
                parent[rootJ] = rootI;
                segmentSum[rootI] += segmentSum[rootJ];
                maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, segmentSum[rootI]);
            }
        }

        // Initialize the result with zero as no segment before any removal
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            result.add(maxSum);
            int idx = removeQueries[i];
            removed[idx] = true;
            segmentSum[idx] = nums[idx];
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, segmentSum[idx]);

            // Join neighboring segments if they have been removed
            if (idx > 0 && removed[idx - 1]) {
                union(idx, idx - 1);
            }
            if (idx < n - 1 && removed[idx + 1]) {
                union(idx, idx + 1);
            }
        }

        // Reverse the result list as we computed it backwards
        Collections.reverse(result);
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 5, 6, 1};
        int[] removeQueries = {0, 3, 2, 4, 1};
        System.out.println(sol.maximumSegmentSum(nums, removeQueries)); // Output: [14, 7, 2, 2, 0]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization:** O(n)
- **Find with path compression:** Amortized O(α(n)) per operation, where α is the inverse Ackermann function.
- **Union:** Amortized O(α(n)) per operation.
- **Overall:** O(n * α(n)), which is efficient enough given typical problem constraints.

This solution maintains the segment sums and efficiently merges them using Union-Find, ensuring that the maximum segment sum can be quickly updated after each removal.
