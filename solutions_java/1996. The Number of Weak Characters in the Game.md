[Leetcode 1996. The Number of Weak Characters in the Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1996)
### Problem Statement

You are playing a game that contains multiple characters, and each character has **two properties**: **attack** and **defense**. You are given a 2D integer array `properties` where `properties[i] = [attack_i, defense_i]` represents the properties of the i-th character in the game.

A character i is said to be **weak** if:
- Another character j exists such that `attack_j > attack_i` and `defense_j > defense_i`.

Return the number of **weak** characters in the game.

### Clarifying Questions

To ensure that we fully understand the problem, let's consider the following clarifying questions:

1. **Are there any constraints on the values of attack and defense?**
   - Yes, the input size can be up to `10^5` and each attack and defense can be in the range of `[1, 10^5]`.

2. **Can multiple characters have the same attack and defense values?**
   - Yes, it is possible for multiple characters to have the same values for attack and defense.

3. **What if all characters have the same properties?**
   - In this case, no character would be considered weak because the condition for a character being weak requires strictly greater values for both attack and defense from another character.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, let's follow this strategy:

1. **Sort the array of characters**:
   - Sort by attack in ascending order. If two characters have the same attack, sort by defense in descending order. This helps in ensuring that when we process characters, we won't have any confusion with characters having the same attack but different defense values.

2. **Iterate and Compare**:
   - Use a single pass through the sorted array to count the number of weak characters. Track the maximum defense encountered as we iterate backward through the list. If a character has defense less than this maximum defense, it is weak.

### Code

Let's implement the problem solution in Java:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class NumberOfWeakCharacters {

    public int numberOfWeakCharacters(int[][] properties) {
        // Sort by attack in ascending, if same attack then defense in descending order
        Arrays.sort(properties, (a, b) -> {
            if (a[0] == b[0]) {
                return b[1] - a[1]; // descending by defense
            } else {
                return a[0] - b[0]; // ascending by attack
            }
        });

        int maxDefense = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int weakCharacters = 0;
        
        // Traverse from end to start to leverage sorted order
        for (int i = properties.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (properties[i][1] < maxDefense) {
                weakCharacters++;
            }
            maxDefense = Math.max(maxDefense, properties[i][1]);
        }
        
        return weakCharacters;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NumberOfWeakCharacters solution = new NumberOfWeakCharacters();

        int[][] properties1 = // use example from above
        System.out.println(solution.numberOfWeakCharacters(properties1)); // Expected output: 0

        int[][] properties2 = // use example from above
        System.out.println(solution.numberOfWeakCharacters(properties2)); // Expected output: 1

        int[][] properties3 = // use example from above
        System.out.println(solution.numberOfWeakCharacters(properties3)); // Expected output: 1
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the array takes \(O(N \log N)\), where \(N\) is the number of characters.
- The linear pass to count the weak characters takes \(O(N)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is **\(O(N \log N)\)**, which is efficient given the constraints \(N \leq 10^5\).
