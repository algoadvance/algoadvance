[Leetcode 1652. Defuse the Bomb](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1652)
### Problem Statement

You have a bomb to defuse, and your time is running out! Your task is to find the code to defuse the bomb by following the instructions below:

- You have a code represented by a circular array `code` of length `n`.
- A certain `key` is required to defuse the bomb, where `key` determines the behavior of the array transformation.

You need to transform the array by creating a new array `answer` of the same length where `answer[i]` is the sum of the next `k` elements (to the right if `k` is positive, to the left if `k` is negative) in the circular array. If `k` is zero, then all elements in `answer` should be zero.

#### Example
1. If the `code` array is `[5,7,1,4]` and `k = 3`, then the `answer` array should be `[12,10,16,13]` because:
   - For `answer[0] = 7 + 1 + 4 = 12`
   - For `answer[1] = 1 + 4 + 5 = 10` (wrap around)
   - For `answer[2] = 4 + 5 + 7 = 16` (wrap around)
   - For `answer[3] = 5 + 7 + 1 = 13` (wrap around)

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can `k` be negative?
2. Are the values in `code` always integers?
3. What is the size range of the `code` array?
4. Is the `code` array guaranteed to be circular?

Let's assume the array `code` contains integers and is circular, the value of `k` can be negative, and there are no other constraints on the values of the array elements.

### Strategy
1. Initialize `answer` array of the same length as `code` with zeros.
2. Iterate through each element in the `code` array.
3. Depending on whether `k` is positive, negative, or zero:
   - If `k` is zero, `answer[i]` will be zero for all elements.
   - If `k` is positive, sum up the next `k` elements to the right, considering the circular nature of the array.
   - If `k` is negative, sum up the `|k|` elements to the left.
4. Utilize modulo operation to handle the circular nature of the array.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] decrypt(int[] code, int k) {
        int n = code.length;
        int[] answer = new int[n];
        
        if (k == 0) return answer;  // if k is 0, return array of all zeros
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int sum = 0;
            if (k > 0) {
                // Sum next k elements to the right
                for (int j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
                    sum += code[(i + j) % n];
                }
            } else {
                // Sum |k| elements to the left
                for (int j = 1; j <= -k; j++) {
                    sum += code[(i - j + n) % n];
                }
            }
            answer[i] = sum;
        }
        
        return answer;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] code = {5, 7, 1, 4};
        int k = 3;
        int[] result = sol.decrypt(code, k);
        for (int num : result) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The overall time complexity of this solution is O(n * |k|). This is because for each element in `code`, we are potentially summing up to `|k|` elements, where `n` is the length of the `code` array and `|k|` is the absolute value of `k`.
- Space complexity is O(n) for the `answer` array.
