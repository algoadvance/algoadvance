[Leetcode 2817. Minimum Absolute Difference Between Elements With Constraint](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2817)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `x`. Find the minimum absolute difference between any two elements `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` such that `|i - j| >= x`.

```plaintext
Example:
Input: nums = [4, 3, 2, 1], x = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: The absolute differences minimum occurs when i = 0 and j = 2, or i = 1 and j = 3, with |1-3|=|2-4|=1.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the input array sorted?**
   - No, the array is not necessarily sorted.

2. **Can `x` be greater than the length of the array?**
   - No, `x` will be a positive integer and will always be less than the length of the array.

3. **What should be returned if there are multiple pairs with the same minimum absolute difference?**
   - Just return the minimum absolute difference as an integer; we do not need to return the pairs.

4. **Are there any constraints on the values of the integers within the array?**
   - The values can be any integers, including negative values.

### Strategy

1. **Naive Approach:**
   - A naive approach would be to use nested loops to compare each pair `(i, j)` where `|i - j| >= x` and compute the absolute difference, keeping track of the minimum.
   - This approach is simple but not efficient as it has a time complexity of O(n^2).

2. **Optimized Approach:**
   - Use a sliding window and a TreeSet to efficiently find pairs that respect the constraint.
   - Iterate through the array while maintaining a sliding window of elements in a TreeSet.
   - For each element, check within the window (TreeSet) for the closest element that maximizes the condition and updates the minimum difference.
   - This method yields a time complexity of O(n log x), where `n` is the number of elements and `log x` is for TreeSet operations.

### Code

```java
import java.util.TreeSet;

public class MinimumAbsoluteDifference {
    public int minAbsoluteDifference(int[] nums, int x) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        TreeSet<Integer> window = new TreeSet<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i + x < n; i++) {
            window.add(nums[i]);
            
            if (i >= x) {
                // Remove the element that is sliding out of the window
                window.remove(nums[i - x]);
            }
            
            Integer ceiling = window.ceiling(nums[i + x]);
            if (ceiling != null) {
                minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, Math.abs(ceiling - nums[i + x]));
            }
            
            Integer floor = window.floor(nums[i + x]);
            if (floor != null) {
                minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, Math.abs(floor - nums[i + x]));
            }
        }
        
        return minDiff;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumAbsoluteDifference mad = new MinimumAbsoluteDifference();
        int[] nums = {4, 3, 2, 1};
        int x = 2;
        System.out.println(mad.minAbsoluteDifference(nums, x));  // Output: 1
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the optimized algorithm is:
- **O(n log x)**: Iterating through the array is O(n), and each insertion, removal, or search operation within the TreeSet is O(log x).

We maintain a sliding window of size roughly `x`, and TreeSet operations (add, remove, floor, ceiling) within this window should be efficient. This ensures our solution scales well even for large input sizes.
