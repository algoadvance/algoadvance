[Leetcode 1262. Greatest Sum Divisible by Three](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1262)
### Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` of integers, we need to find the maximum sum of the elements of the array that is divisible by `3`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Can the array have negative numbers?
   **A**: Yes, the array can contain negative numbers.
   
2. **Q**: What is the range of the array's length and the values within the array?
   **A**: The length of the array can be from 1 to \(10^4\), and the values within the array can range from \(-10^4\) to \(10^4\).

3. **Q**: Do we need to output the subset of the array that sums to the maximum value divisible by 3, or just the sum?
   **A**: We only need to return the sum that is divisible by 3.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming (DP) approach. Here's the strategy:

1. **State Definition**: Use an array `dp` of size 3 where:
   - `dp[0]` represents the maximum sum of elements that are divisible by 3.
   - `dp[1]` represents the maximum sum of elements that gives a remainder of 1 when divided by 3.
   - `dp[2]` represents the maximum sum of elements that gives a remainder of 2 when divided by 3.

2. **Initialization**: Initialize the `dp` array to [0, Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE], because the sum starts at 0 and we need to ensure invalid states are properly tracked.

3. **Transition**: Iterate through each number in the input array. For each number, update the `dp` array based on the current sums plus the number itself. Use a temporary copy of `dp` to avoid modifying `dp` while iterating over it.

4. **Result**: After processing all numbers in the array, `dp[0]` will contain the maximum sum that is divisible by 3.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxSumDivThree(int[] nums) {
        int[] dp = new int[]{0, Integer.MIN_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE};
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            int[] temp = new int[3];
            System.arraycopy(dp, 0, temp, 0, 3);
            
            for (int sum : dp) {
                int newSum = sum + num;
                temp[newSum % 3] = Math.max(temp[newSum % 3], newSum);
            }
            
            System.arraycopy(temp, 0, dp, 0, 3);
        }
        
        return dp[0];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because we are iterating through the array exactly once and updating a constant-size (3-element) array during each iteration.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is \(O(1)\), as we are using a fixed-size array of length 3, irrespective of the input size.

With this approach, we ensure that we always maintain the best possible sum for each remainder category (0, 1, and 2), thus efficiently finding the maximum sum that is divisible by 3.
