[Leetcode 132. Palindrome Partitioning II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l132)
### Problem Statement:

Given a string `s`, partition `s` such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of `s`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **What is the maximum length of the string `s`?**
   - The maximum length of `s` is usually set in constraints (for instance, up to 2000 characters), but knowing will help us gauge the efficiency required.

2. **Are there any constraints like all characters being lowercase or only alphabets?**
   - This would simplify assumptions while writing the palindrome checking logic.

3. **Is an empty string considered a valid palindrome partition?**
   - Generally, yes. If `s` is empty, the minimum number of cuts is 0.

### Strategy:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - We will use two DP arrays to solve the problem: 
     - `minCuts` which will store the minimum cuts required for substring `s[0...i]`.
     - `isPalindrome` which tells us whether a substring `s[j...i]` is a palindrome.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize `minCuts` array for each character (worst case each character might need individual partitions). For `isPalindrome`, initialize to default false.
   
3. **Filling the `isPalindrome` array:**
   - We iterate over possible substring lengths and use the property of palindromes where if `s[j] == s[i]` and the internal string `s[j+1...i-1]` is a palindrome, then `s[j...i]` is also a palindrome.
   
4. **Filling the `minCuts` array:**
   - For each end index `i`, determine the minimum cuts required by checking each start index `j`. If `s[j...i]` is a palindrome, then `minCuts[i]` can be updated based on the previous cuts.

### Code:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minCut(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        if (n == 0) return 0;

        // minCuts[i] represents the minimum cuts for substring s[0...i]
        int[] minCuts = new int[n];
        // isPalindrome[i][j] will be true if substring s[i...j] is a palindrome
        boolean[][] isPalindrome = new boolean[n][n];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            minCuts[i] = i; // maximum cuts needed if there are no palindromes
            for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
                if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j) && (i - j <= 2 || isPalindrome[j+1][i-1])) {
                    isPalindrome[j][i] = true;

                    // If the whole substring s[0...i] is a palindrome, no cuts are needed
                    if (j == 0) {
                        minCuts[i] = 0;
                    } else {
                        minCuts[i] = Math.min(minCuts[i], minCuts[j-1] + 1);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return minCuts[n-1];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- Filling the `isPalindrome` array: O(n^2), as for each substring we check whether it is a palindrome.
- Updating the `minCuts` array: O(n^2), as we might compare each end index with all possible start indices.
- The overall time complexity is O(n^2).
  
### Space Complexity:

- The space complexity is O(n^2) for the `isPalindrome` array and O(n) for the `minCuts` array, resulting in O(n^2) overall.

This approach ensures that we find the minimum cuts required to partition the string such that every part is a palindrome efficiently.
