[Leetcode 1557. Minimum Number of Vertices to Reach All Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1557)
### Problem Statement

You are given a directed acyclic graph with `n` vertices, labeled from `0` to `n-1`, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [from_i, to_i]` indicates that there is a direct edge going from `from_i` to `to_i`.

Find the smallest set of vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable. It's guaranteed that a unique solution exists.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What are the constraints on the number of vertices `n`?
   **A:** The constraints generally follow LeetCode medium constraints, specifically, `1 <= n <= 10^5`.

2. **Q:** Is the graph always connected?
   **A:** The problem states that we are dealing with a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), so it is not necessarily connected.

3. **Q:** Can we have multiple edges between the same pair of nodes?
   **A:** No, typically DAGs represented in this context do not have multiple edges between the same pair of nodes.

4. **Q:** Are self-loops (`from_i == to_i`) allowed?
   **A:** The problem statement does not mention self-loops explicitly, but usually, DAGs do not include self-loops.

### Strategy

The vertices we are interested in finding are the ones with no incoming edges, as these are the only vertices that must be included in the set to ensure all other nodes are reachable.
1. Create an array to count the incoming edges for each vertex.
2. Traverse the list of edges and update the incoming edge count for each vertex.
3. The vertices with an incoming edge count of zero are the vertices from which all nodes in the graph are reachable.

### Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class MinimumVerticesToReachAllNodes {
    public List<Integer> findSmallestSetOfVertices(int n, List<List<Integer>> edges) {
        // Create an array to keep track of in-degrees
        int[] inDegree = new int[n];
        
        // Iterate over the edges to compute in-degree of each node
        for (List<Integer> edge : edges) {
            int to = edge.get(1);
            inDegree[to]++;
        }
        
        // Collect vertices with zero in-degree
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (inDegree[i] == 0) {
                result.add(i);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumVerticesToReachAllNodes solver = new MinimumVerticesToReachAllNodes();
        
        int n = 6;
        List<List<Integer>> edges = new ArrayList<>();
        edges.add(List.of(0, 1));
        edges.add(List.of(0, 2));
        edges.add(List.of(2, 5));
        edges.add(List.of(3, 4));
        edges.add(List.of(4, 2));
        
        List<Integer> result = solver.findSmallestSetOfVertices(n, edges);
        System.out.println(result); // Output: [0, 3]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization of `inDegree` array:** O(n)
- **Computation of in-degrees:** O(E), where E is the number of edges.
- **Collection of the result:** O(n)

Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n + E)**, which is efficient for the given constraints (`n, E <= 10^5`). The space complexity is also **O(n)** due to the storage of the `inDegree` array and the result list.
