[Leetcode 2612. Minimum Reverse Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2612)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n` and two arrays: `blocked` and `range` of the same size. The integer `n` represents a range from `0` to `n-1`. Each value in `blocked` represents a blocked starting position, and each corresponding value in `range` represents the length of range that can be operated in reverse from the starting position.

Your task is to find the minimum number of reverse operations required to return the array to a sorted sequence from a partially reversed sequence. Reversing a range from index `i` to `j` means changing the order of elements from `i` to `j`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What's the maximum size of `n`?
   - Can we assume elements in `blocked` are distinct?
   - What values are expected in the `range` array?

2. **Output:**
   - Should the function return the minimum number of reverse operations, or some other form of output such as the sequence of operations?

3. **Additional Details:**
   - Are there any constraints on the order of operations?
   - Can a position be in the middle of a reverse operation?
   - What should the behavior be if the array is already sorted or cannot be sorted due to blockages?

## Strategy

1. **Model the Problem:**
   - View the sequence as segments that can be reversed.
   - Identify blocked segments which cannot be reversed.
   
2. **Graph-Based Approach:**
   - Treat range reversals as edges in a graph and use something like BFS or DFS to minimize operations.
   
3. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - Use DP to count the minimum operations required. 
   
4. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Create a representation of the sequence.
   - Apply constraints based on the blocked array.
   - Evaluate possible operations to sort the array.

## Code

Here's an initial approach to solve the problem using a combination of graph traversal for minimal operations:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MinimumReverseOperations {
    // Function to get the minimum number of reverse operations
    public int minReverseOperations(int n, int[] blocked, int[] range) {
        Set<Integer> blockedSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (int block : blocked) {
            blockedSet.add(block);
        }
        
        // Priority queue to keep track of the minimal operations required
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[1]));
        pq.offer(new int[] {0, 0}); // Starting with the 0th position and 0 operations
        
        // Visited array to avoid cycles
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            int[] current = pq.poll();
            int curPos = current[0];
            int curOps = current[1];
            
            // If reached the last position
            if (curPos == n - 1) {
                return curOps;
            }

            // If the position is blocked, skip
            if (blockedSet.contains(curPos) || visited[curPos]) continue;
            
            visited[curPos] = true;
            
            // Iterate over allowed range of reversals
            for (int r : range) {
                for (int i = 0; i + r < n; i++) {
                    int newStart = i;
                    int newEnd = i + r;
                    if (curPos >= newStart && curPos <= newEnd) {
                        // Enqueue position to start reversing if within a valid range
                        pq.offer(new int[] {newEnd, curOps + 1});
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        // If no valid way found to sort the array, return -1
        return -1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumReverseOperations mro = new MinimumReverseOperations();
        int[] blocked = {3, 5};
        int[] range = {2, 3};
        int result = mro.minReverseOperations(6, blocked, range);
        System.out.println(result); // Expected output: Minimum operations to sort the sequence
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- In the worst case, the time complexity is \(O(n \times m)\), where `n` is the length of the range and `m` is the length of the `range` array.
- Space complexity is \(O(n)\) for the visited set and the priority queue.
