[Leetcode 1143. Longest Common Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1143)
### Problem Statement

The **Longest Common Subsequence** (LCS) problem is to find the length of the longest subsequence present in both of the given two sequences. A subsequence is a sequence that appears in the same relative order but not necessarily contiguous. For example, "abc", "abg", "bdf", "aeg", "acefg", .. etc are subsequences of "abcdefg".

Given two strings `text1` and `text2`, return the length of their longest common subsequence.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: text1 = "abcde", text2 = "ace" 
Output: 3  
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "ace" and its length is 3.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest common subsequence is "abc" and its length is 3.
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: text1 = "abc", text2 = "def"
Output: 0
Explanation: There is no such common subsequence, so the result is 0.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the strings case-sensitive?**
   - Yes, typically LCS problems are case-sensitive.

2. **What is the maximum length of the input strings?**
   - Let's assume each string can be up to 1000 characters long.

3. **Can the input strings be empty?**
   - Yes, if either string is empty, the LCS length is 0.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we will use **Dynamic Programming (DP)**.

- We will create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of LCS of `text1[0..i-1]` and `text2[0..j-1]`.
- If `text1[i-1] == text2[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`.
- Otherwise, `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.
- The value at `dp[text1.length()][text2.length()]` will have our answer.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int longestCommonSubsequence(String text1, String text2) {
        int m = text1.length();
        int n = text2.length();
        
        // dp array initialization
        int[][] dp = new int[m+1][n+1];
        
        // fill the dp array
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                if (text1.charAt(i-1) == text2.charAt(j-1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[m][n];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.longestCommonSubsequence("abcde", "ace")); // Output: 3
        System.out.println(sol.longestCommonSubsequence("abc", "abc")); // Output: 3
        System.out.println(sol.longestCommonSubsequence("abc", "def")); // Output: 0
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is **O(m * n)**, where `m` is the length of the first string and `n` is the length of the second string. This is because we fill up an `m x n` 2D array in a nested loop.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is also **O(m * n)** due to the 2D array `dp` we used for storing intermediate results.
