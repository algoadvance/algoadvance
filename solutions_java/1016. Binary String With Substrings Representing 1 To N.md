[Leetcode 1016. Binary String With Substrings Representing 1 To N](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1016)
### Problem Statement

Given a binary string `s` and a positive integer `n`, return true if for every integer `i` in the range `1` to `n` inclusive, the binary representation of `i` is a substring of `s`, or false otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**: What is the maximum length of the binary string `s` and the maximum value of `n`?
   - Typically, the length of `s` and the value of `n` would be bound by practical limits for interview settings.
2. **Multiple Occurrences**: Do the binary representations need to appear only once in `s`?
   - As long as each binary representation of numbers from 1 to `n` appears at least once, it should be fine.
3. **Leading Zeros**: Do binary representations consider leading zeros?
   - No, binary numbers aren't usually represented with leading zeros (except for `0` itself which is not in range `1` to `n`).

### Strategy

1. **Iterate from 1 to n**: Convert each integer in the range 1 to `n` into its binary representation.
2. **Check Substrings**: For each binary representation, verify if it is a substring of `s`.
3. **Final Decision**: If all binary representations are substrings of `s`, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean queryString(String s, int n) {
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            String binary = Integer.toBinaryString(i);
            if (!s.contains(binary)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Conversion**: Converting an integer `i` into its binary form takes `O(log i)` time.
- **Substring Check**: Checking if a shorter string is a substring of a longer one can be done in `O(|s|)` time.

Thus, the overall time complexity:
- Checking all integers from 1 to `n` is `O(n)`.
- For each integer, converting to binary and checking as a substring takes `O(log n)` and `O(|s|)` respectively.

Combining these, the overall time complexity is `O(n * (log n + |s|))`.

This complexity influences:
- If `|s|` is considerably large compared to `n`, the substring check dominates: `O(n * |s|)`.
- If `|s|` is reasonably small, the complexity is influenced by both binary conversion and substring checks.

However, in many practical cases, `|s|` is not exceedingly large, making the efficient algorithm feasible for moderate `n` values.
