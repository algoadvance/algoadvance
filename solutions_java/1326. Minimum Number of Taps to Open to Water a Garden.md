[Leetcode 1326. Minimum Number of Taps to Open to Water a Garden](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1326)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n` representing the length of a garden, and an integer array `ranges` of length `n+1` where `ranges[i]` (0-indexed) means the `i-th` tap can water the interval `[i - ranges[i], i + ranges[i]]` if it is open.

Return *the minimum number of taps that need to be open to water the whole garden, or* `-1` *if the garden cannot be watered completely.*

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What constraints are we working with?**
    - `1 <= n <= 10^4`
    - `0 <= ranges[i] <= 100`

2. **Can multiple taps cover the same section of the garden?**
    - Yes, multiple taps can have overlapping coverage areas.

3. **What happens if a part of the garden cannot be covered?**
    - If there is any part of the garden that cannot be covered, we should return `-1`.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use the interval covering or jump game approach:

1. **Intervals Creation**:
    - First, create intervals from the given `ranges` such that each tap's effective watering interval is captured.

2. **Interval Merging**:
    - Sort the intervals based on the starting points. If two intervals start at the same point, sort them based on ending points in descending order.

3. **Greedy Selection**:
    - Use a greedy algorithm to choose the minimum number of intervals to cover the entire length from `0` to `n`.
    - Track the farthest point that can be covered and count the minimum number of taps required.

### Code
Here's the implementation of the above strategy in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minTaps(int n, int[] ranges) {
        // Create intervals
        int[][] intervals = new int[n + 1][2];
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            intervals[i][0] = Math.max(0, i - ranges[i]);
            intervals[i][1] = Math.min(n, i + ranges[i]);
        }
        
        // Sort intervals by starting point, for same starting point sort by ending point in descending
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> (a[0] == b[0]) ? b[1] - a[1] : a[0] - b[0]);
        
        int taps = 0;
        int end = 0;
        int nextEnd = 0;
        int i = 0;
        
        while (end < n) {
            // Find the tap providing the farthest reach within current coverage
            while (i <= n && intervals[i][0] <= end) {
                nextEnd = Math.max(nextEnd, intervals[i][1]);
                i++;
            }
            // If no further reach is possible, return -1
            if (end == nextEnd) {
                return -1;
            }
            end = nextEnd;
            taps++;
        }
        
        return taps;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Intervals Creation**: O(n)
- **Sorting Intervals**: O(n log n)
- **Greedy Selection**: O(n)

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n log n) primarily due to the sorting of intervals. The space complexity is O(n) due to the extra storage for intervals, which is efficient for this problem's constraints.
