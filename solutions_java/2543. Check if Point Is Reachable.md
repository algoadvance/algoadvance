[Leetcode 2543. Check if Point Is Reachable](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2543)
### Problem Statement

We are given a starting coordinate at (1, 1) and a target coordinate at (x, y) on a plane. We can move from any point (a, b) to (a + b, b) or (a, a + b) repeatedly. The task is to determine if we can reach the target coordinate (x, y) starting from (1, 1) using the allowed moves.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of coordinates:** Are there any constraints on the values of x and y? 
   - Assume x and y are positive integers.
2. **Time Limits:** Are there any constraints on the time limit?
   - Assume typical constraints for competitive programming, usually a solution under 1-2 seconds is acceptable.

### Strategy
A key observation for this problem is that the process of moving from `(a, b)` to `(a + b, b)` or `(a, a + b)` is akin to additive steps. Instead of trying to simulate these movements forward from `(1, 1)`, we can think about the reverse operations:
- From `(x, y)`, if `x > y`, we could have come from `(x - y, y)`.
- Similarly, if `y > x`, we could have come from `(x, y - x)`.

By repeatedly applying these reverse operations, we need to check if we can reduce `(x, y)` back to `(1, 1)`.

To optimize, we can leverage the properties of the greatest common divisor (GCD). Specifically, if `gcd(x, y) == 1`, it means we can eventually reach `(1, 1)` from `(x, y)` using the given operations.

### Code
```java
public class ReachablePoint {
    public boolean isReachable(int x, int y) {
        // Reduce x and y by the greatest common divisor
        while (x > 1 && y > 1) {
            if (x > y) {
                x %= y;
            } else {
                y %= x;
            }
        }
        // Check if either x or y is reduced to 1
        return x == 1 || y == 1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ReachablePoint rp = new ReachablePoint();
        // Test cases
        System.out.println(rp.isReachable(5, 7)); // Expected output: true
        System.out.println(rp.isReachable(10, 2)); // Expected output: true
        System.out.println(rp.isReachable(3, 5)); // Expected output: true
        System.out.println(rp.isReachable(12, 8)); // Expected output: false
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the algorithm is O(log(min(x, y))), as each modulo operation effectively halves the size of the larger number (in terms of number of bits required to represent it).

- In the worst case, the number of operations is bounded by the number of bits in the smaller of the two numbers.
- Since checking the GCD takes logarithmic time relative to the size of the smaller number, the overall time complexity is efficient and suitable for very large values of `x` and `y`.
