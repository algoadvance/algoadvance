[Leetcode 1582. Special Positions in a Binary Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1582)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `mat` of `1`'s (representing soldiers) and `0`'s (representing civilians). A position `(i, j)` in the matrix is called special if:

1. `mat[i][j] == 1`, and
2. All other elements in row `i` and column `j` are 0.

Return the number of special positions in the matrix.

#### Example:
```
Input: 
mat = [
 [1,0,0],
 [0,0,1],
 [1,0,0]
]

Output: 1

Explanation: 
(1, 2) is a special position because it is '1' and all other elements in the row and column are 0.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the matrix guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, the matrix `mat` is guaranteed to have at least one element (m >= 1 and n >= 1).
   
2. **Can the matrix have multiple special positions?**
   - Yes, there can be multiple special positions.

3. **Can a row or column have more than one soldier (1)?**
   - Yes, but if a row or column has more than one soldier, they cannot be considered special positions.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate through the matrix**: We'll iterate through each element of the matrix.
2. **Check conditions**: For each element, if it is `1`, we'll check all other elements in its row and column.
3. **Count special positions**: Maintain a counter to keep track of elements that fulfill the special position criteria.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int numSpecial(int[][] mat) {
        int m = mat.length;
        int n = mat[0].length;
        int specialCount = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (mat[i][j] == 1) {
                    boolean isSpecial = true;
                    // Check row i
                    for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
                        if (k != j && mat[i][k] == 1) {
                            isSpecial = false;
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                    // Check column j
                    if (isSpecial) {
                        for (int k = 0; k < m; k++) {
                            if (k != i && mat[k][j] == 1) {
                                isSpecial = false;
                                break;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                    if (isSpecial) {
                        specialCount++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return specialCount;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Best Case**: `O(m * n)` where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.
- We iterate through each element once and conduct row and column checks which can take `O(n)` and `O(m)` respectively. Therefore, it becomes `O(m * n * (m + n))` in the worst case, but improvements can be made.

A possible optimization could involve precomputing the sum of rows and columns to quickly check if they contain another '1'.

Would you like to proceed with the optimized version?
