[Leetcode 2446. Determine if Two Events Have Conflict full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2446)
## Problem Statement
You are given two arrays of strings `event1` and `event2` where:
- `event1 = [startTime1, endTime1]` and
- `event2 = [startTime2, endTime2]`.

Event times are given in the format "HH:MM".

Determine if the two events have a conflict, meaning they overlap in time.

Return `true` if there is a conflict between the two events, and `false` otherwise.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Is each time guaranteed to be in the "HH:MM" 24-hour format?
    - Yes.
2. Can the times for an individual event cross midnight and make dates relevant?
    - No, the times will be within a single day (00:00 to 23:59).

## Strategy
1. **Parse the Input Times:** Convert the start and end times of each event from "HH:MM" format to a comparable format such as the number of minutes since midnight.
2. **Compare Intervals:** Check if the time intervals `[startTime1, endTime1]` and `[startTime2, endTime2]` overlap.
    - Two intervals `[start1, end1]` and `[start2, end2]` overlap if `start1 < end2` and `start2 < end1`.

## Code
```java
public class EventConflict {
    public boolean haveConflict(String[] event1, String[] event2) {
        int start1 = toMinutes(event1[0]);
        int end1 = toMinutes(event1[1]);
        int start2 = toMinutes(event2[0]);
        int end2 = toMinutes(event2[1]);

        // Check if there is an overlap
        return start1 < end2 && start2 < end1;
    }

    private int toMinutes(String time) {
        String[] parts = time.split(":");
        int hours = Integer.parseInt(parts[0]);
        int minutes = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]);
        return hours * 60 + minutes;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        EventConflict ec = new EventConflict();
        String[] event1 = {"01:15", "02:00"};
        String[] event2 = {"02:00", "03:00"};
        System.out.println(ec.haveConflict(event1, event2)); // Output should be true
    }
}
```

## Explanation
1. **Conversion Function:** `toMinutes` converts "HH:MM" time into minutes since midnight.
2. **Conflict Check:** We then check if one event starts before the other ends and vice versa to determine an overlap.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity is O(1) because it involves only a constant amount of work (parsing a few strings and basic comparisons).

The space complexity is also O(1) because we only use a fixed amount of additional memory regardless of the input size.
