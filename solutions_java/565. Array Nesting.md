[Leetcode 565. Array Nesting](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l565)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` where `nums` is a permutation of the numbers in the range `[0, n - 1]`.

You should build a set `s[k] = {nums[k], nums[nums[k]], nums[nums[nums[k]]], ... }` subjected to the rule below.

Suppose the first element in `s[k]` starts with the selection of the element `nums[k]` of `nums`. The next element in `s[k]` should be `nums[nums[k]]`, and then `nums[nums[nums[k]]]`, and so on. By that analog, we stop adding right before a duplicate element occurs in `s[k]`.

Return the longest length of a set `s[k]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the array `nums` guaranteed to be a permutation of `[0, n - 1]` without any duplicates?**
   - Yes.

2. **Should we expect large input sizes for `nums`?**
   - Yes, your solution should account for potentially large inputs efficiently.

3. **Can we modify the input array `nums`?**
   - Yes, modifying `nums` is allowed to optimize space usage.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Loops**: Because `nums` is a permutation of numbers `[0, n-1]`, it means each element in `nums` is unique and appears exactly once. We can form cycles starting from any element. Our goal is to find the length of the longest cycle.

2. **Visited Array**: Use a boolean array to keep track of visited indices to avoid recalculating lengths of cycles starting from the same elements multiple times.

3. **Iterate and Count**: For each index, if it's not visited, perform a traversal to count the length of the cycle starting from that index.

4. **Optimization**:
   - Use the input array `nums` itself to mark elements as visited by modifying their value.
   - While traversing a cycle, mark the elements to avoid revisiting them.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int arrayNesting(int[] nums) {
        int maxSize = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
                int size = 0;
                int start = i;

                while (nums[start] != Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
                    int temp = start;
                    start = nums[start];
                    size++;
                    nums[temp] = Integer.MAX_VALUE; // Mark as visited
                }
                
                maxSize = Math.max(maxSize, size);
            }
        }

        return maxSize;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input array `nums`. Each element will be visited at most once.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(1)\) aside from the input storage because we only use a few extra variables for counting and marking as visited within the existing array.
