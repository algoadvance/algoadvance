[Leetcode 393. UTF](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l393)
### Problem Statement

A character in UTF8 can be from 1 to 4 bytes long, subjected to the following rules:

- For a 1-byte character, the first bit is a 0, followed by its unicode code.
- For an n-bytes character (n > 1), the first n bits are all one's, the n+1 bit is 0, followed by n-1 bytes with the most significant 2 bits being 10.

This means that the binary representation of the byte starts with the following pattern for n bytes:
- 1-byte character: 0xxxxxxx
- 2-byte character: 110xxxxx 10xxxxxx
- 3-byte character: 1110xxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx
- 4-byte character: 11110xxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx 10xxxxxx

Given an array of integers representing the data, return whether it is a valid UTF-8 encoding.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What data type is the input array?**
   - The input is an array of integers.
   
2. **What is the range of the integers?**
   - Each integer in the array is between 0 and 255 (inclusive), representing each byte in the data.

3. **What should the function return if the data is valid or invalid UTF-8?**
   - The function should return `true` if the data is valid UTF-8 encoding and `false` otherwise.

### Strategy

1. **Bit Manipulation:**
   - To solve this problem, we will utilize bit manipulation to check the leading bits of each byte.
   
2. **Main Steps:**
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of how many bytes are expected in the current UTF-8 character.
   - Iterate through the array:
     - If we are expecting a new character (i.e., not in the middle of a multi-byte character), determine the number of bytes based on the leading bits.
     - If in the middle of a multi-byte character, ensure the current byte starts with `10`.
   - Ensure no extra bytes are expected at the end of the array.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the UTF-8 validation in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean validUtf8(int[] data) {
        int numberOfBytes = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < data.length; i++) {
            int num = data[i];
            
            // If this is a new character, calculate the number of bytes
            if (numberOfBytes == 0) {
                if ((num >> 5) == 0b110) numberOfBytes = 1;
                else if ((num >> 4) == 0b1110) numberOfBytes = 2;
                else if ((num >> 3) == 0b11110) numberOfBytes = 3;
                else if ((num >> 7) == 0b0) numberOfBytes = 0;
                else return false;
            } else {
                // Check if the byte is a valid continuation (10xxxxxx)
                if ((num >> 6) != 0b10) return false;
                numberOfBytes--;
            }
        }
        
        // All characters should be properly ended
        return numberOfBytes == 0;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        
        int[] data1 = {197, 130, 1};
        System.out.println(solution.validUtf8(data1)); // Output: true

        int[] data2 = {235, 140, 4};
        System.out.println(solution.validUtf8(data2)); // Output: false
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - We iterate through the data array once, where `n` is the length of the input array.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - The space required is constant, as we only use a few extra variables.

This solution ensures that the given data adheres to the UTF-8 encoding rules by validating each byte appropriately and keeping track of how many continuation bytes are expected.
