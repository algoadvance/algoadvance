[Leetcode 1589. Maximum Sum Obtained of Any Permutation full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1589)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums` and an array `requests` where `requests[i] = [starti, endi]` represents a request to increment each element of the subarray `nums[starti]` to `nums[endi]` (inclusive) by 1. After processing all `requests`, choose a permutation of `nums` that maximizes the sum of the elements in the subarrays specified by the requests, and return the maximum sum.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`
- `1 <= requests.length <= 10^5`
- `requests[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= starti <= endi < nums.length`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are all elements in `nums` non-negative?**
   Yes, per the given constraints.

2. **Can the range `[starti, endi]` in `requests` overlap?**
   Yes, multiple requests can overlap.

3. **Is there a specific order in which the permutations should be considered?**
   We need to find the permutation that yields the maximum sum after processing all requests.

### Strategy

1. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - Use a differential array approach to efficiently calculate how often each index in `nums` is requested.
   - Create an array `frequency` where `frequency[i]` is incremented at `starti` and decremented at `endi+1`. Then, compute the actual frequencies by doing a prefix sum on the frequency array.

2. **Maximize Sum with Sorting:**
   - Sort the `frequency` array to know the frequency of each index.
   - Sort the `nums` array as well.
   - Pair the highest numbers in `nums` with the highest frequencies to maximize the sum.

3. **Calculate the Final Sum:**
   - Multiply each number in the sorted `nums` by the corresponding frequency from the sorted frequency array.
   - Sum these products to get the final result.

### Time Complexity
- Sorting `nums` takes \(O(n \log n)\)
- Sorting the frequency array also takes \(O(n \log n)\)
- Prefix sum to build the frequency array takes \(O(n)\)
- Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\)

### Code

Here is the Java implementation based on the described strategy:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MaximumSumOfPermutation {
    public int maxSumRangeQuery(int[] nums, int[][] requests) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] frequency = new int[n];

        // Step 1: Calculate the frequency of each index in nums
        for (int[] request : requests) {
            int start = request[0];
            int end = request[1];
            frequency[start]++;
            if (end + 1 < n) {
                frequency[end + 1]--;
            }
        }
        
        // Prefix sum to find the number of times each index is requested
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            frequency[i] += frequency[i - 1];
        }
        
        // Sort nums and frequency arrays
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        Arrays.sort(frequency);
        
        // Step 2: Calculate the maximum sum
        long maxSum = 0;
        int MOD = 1_000_000_007;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            maxSum = (maxSum + (long) nums[i] * frequency[i]) % MOD;
        }
        
        return (int) maxSum;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximumSumOfPermutation solution = new MaximumSumOfPermutation();
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int[][] requests = {{1, 3}, {0, 1}};
        System.out.println(solution.maxSumRangeQuery(nums, requests)); // Output: 19
    }
}
```

In this implementation:
1. We calculate the frequency of each index being included in the request ranges.
2. We then sort both the `nums` array and the `frequency` array.
3. Finally, we pair them to maximize the sum and return the result.

This solution leverages sorting and prefix sums to operate efficiently within the given constraints.
