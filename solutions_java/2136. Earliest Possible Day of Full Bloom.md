[Leetcode 2136. Earliest Possible Day of Full Bloom](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2136)
### Problem Statement

You have `n` flowers where the `i-th` flower needs `plantTime[i]` days to plant and `growTime[i]` days to grow until it reaches full bloom. You can plant the flowers in any order. You need to determine the earliest possible day where all flowers are in full bloom.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the `plantTime` and `growTime` arrays of the same length?**
   - Yes.

2. **Can we plant multiple flowers on the same day but in a different order?**
   - Yes, you can decide the order of planting to optimize the bloom day.

3. **What is the definition of "earliest possible day"?**
   - It means the smallest day number at which the last flower reaches full bloom.

4. **Is there any constraint on the length of the arrays or the values within them?**
   - The constraint is that `1 <= plantTime.length == growTime.length <= 10^5` and `1 <= plantTime[i], growTime[i] <= 10^4`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently:

1. **Sort by Grow Time:** The idea is to focus on planting flowers with longer grow times first because they take the longest time to reach full bloom once planted.
   
2. **Iterate and Calculate:** After sorting, iterate through the flowers, keeping track of the total number of days spent planting so far, and check the full bloom day for each flower.

We'll sort the flowers by `growTime` in descending order (largest first). For each flower, after accounting for the planting days spent so far, we compute when it will fully bloom and keep track of the maximum such value.

### Code

Here is the Java implementation:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class EarliestFullBloom {
    public int earliestFullBloom(int[] plantTime, int[] growTime) {
        int n = plantTime.length;
        
        // Combine plantTime and growTime into a single array for sorting
        int[][] flowers = new int[n][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            flowers[i][0] = plantTime[i];
            flowers[i][1] = growTime[i];
        }
        
        // Sort by growTime in descending order
        Arrays.sort(flowers, (a, b) -> b[1] - a[1]);

        int currentDay = 0;
        int maxBloomDay = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            currentDay += flowers[i][0]; // Add plantTime for current flower
            int bloomDay = currentDay + flowers[i][1]; // When it will fully bloom
            maxBloomDay = Math.max(maxBloomDay, bloomDay); // Track the latest full bloom day
        }
        
        return maxBloomDay;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** Sorting the flowers array based on growTime in descending order takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Iterating:** Iterating through the `flowers` array takes \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sorting step being the dominant factor. 

This approach ensures we find the earliest possible day all flowers are in full bloom efficiently.
