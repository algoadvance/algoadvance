[Leetcode 456. 132 Pattern](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l456)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of n integers `nums`, a 132 pattern is a subsequence of three integers `nums[i]`, `nums[j]`, and `nums[k]` such that `i < j < k` and `nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j]`. Find whether any 132 pattern exists in `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the range of values for `n` (the length of the array)?
2. **Value Range**: What are the possible values for the integers in the array `nums`?
3. **Output**: Should the function return a boolean indicating the presence of the pattern?

For the sake of this problem, we will assume:
- The length of `nums` can range from 1 to 100,000.
- The values in `nums` can range between `-10^9` and `10^9`.

### Strategy

To find the 132 pattern, we need to find three indices i, j, and k such that:
- `i < j < k`
- `nums[i] < nums[k] < nums[j]`

A straightforward solution with three nested loops would be too slow (O(n^3) time complexity). Instead, we can use a more efficient approach with a combination of arrays/stacks to keep track of potential candidates for the 132 pattern.

#### Efficient Approach:

1. **Min Array**: First, create an array `minArray` where `minArray[i]` stores the minimum value in `nums` from index 0 to i. This helps us keep track of the smallest value (candidate for nums[i]) before the current element.
2. **Traverse Backwards**: Use a stack to keep track of potential `nums[k]` values (which must be less than the current `nums[j]` but greater than the minimum value up to that point).
   
Hereâ€™s a step-by-step outline:
1. Create `minArray` such that `minArray[i]` is the minimum value in `nums[0:i+1]`
2. Traverse the array from right to left (for `j`), maintaining a stack for possible values of `nums[k]`
3. For each `nums[j]`, ensure that we pop elements from the stack that are less than `minArray[j]` (as they cannot satisfy the 132 pattern condition)
4. If we find a value in the stack which is greater than `minArray[j]` and less than `nums[j]`, then we have found a valid 132 pattern.

### Code

Here's the Java code to implement this strategy:

```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class Solution {
    public boolean find132pattern(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length < 3) return false;

        // Step 1: Create minArray
        int[] minArray = new int[nums.length];
        minArray[0] = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            minArray[i] = Math.min(minArray[i-1], nums[i]);
        }

        // Step 2: Traverse from right to left to find 132 pattern
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        for (int j = nums.length - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            if (nums[j] > minArray[j]) {
                while (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() <= minArray[j]) {
                    stack.pop();
                }
                if (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() < nums[j]) {
                    return true;
                }
                stack.push(nums[j]);
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - Creating the `minArray` takes O(n) time.
  - Traversing `nums` from right to left while using the stack operations takes O(n) time.

- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - Storing the `minArray` and the stack both require O(n) space.

This solution is efficient and should perform well for the given problem constraints.
