[Leetcode 2772. Apply Operations to Make All Array Elements Equal to Zero](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2772)
### Problem Statement:
You are given a 0-indexed integer array nums consisting of n positive numbers.

You can do the following operation as many times as you want:

- Pick any two indices i and j, where `0 <= i, j < n`, and `i != j`.
- Subtract the smaller number from the bigger number.

Your task is to determine whether it's possible to make all elements in the array equal to zero after any number of operations.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the range of `n` (the length of the array)?
    - What is the range of the elements in `nums`?

2. **Output**:
    - Should the function return a boolean value indicating whether it's possible to make all elements equal to zero?

3. **Operations**:
    - Can elements in the array be modified, or do we need to preserve the original state?

### Strategy:
To determine whether it is possible to make all elements of the array equal to zero, we can leverage some number theory insights:
- The key insight is that two numbers can both be reduced to zero if they share a common divisor that can eventually be reduced to zero.
- This common divisor is the **Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)**.
- If all elements of the array share the same GCD and that GCD is 1, then you can always reduce all elements to zero. If the GCD is greater than 1, it's impossible.

The steps are:
1. Compute the GCD of the entire array.
2. Check if the GCD is 1.
   
### Code:
```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean canMakeAllZero(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // Calculate the GCD of the entire array
        int gcdResult = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            gcdResult = gcd(gcdResult, nums[i]);
            // If at any point the GCD becomes 1, we can return true immediately
            if (gcdResult == 1) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        
        // If the final GCD is not 1, we cannot make all elements zero
        return gcdResult == 1;
    }
    
    // Helper method to compute GCD of two numbers
    private int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            return a;
        }
        return gcd(b, a % b);
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums1 = {6, 9, 15};
        System.out.println(sol.canMakeAllZero(nums1)); // True
        
        int[] nums2 = {2, 4, 6, 8};
        System.out.println(sol.canMakeAllZero(nums2)); // False
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **GCD computation**: The time complexity to compute the GCD of two numbers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm is `O(log(min(a, b)))`.
- **Iterating through the array**: We compute the GCD for each pair in the array, leading to a total time complexity of `O(n * log(max(nums)))`, where `n` is the length of the array and `max(nums)` is the maximum number in the array.
