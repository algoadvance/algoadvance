[Leetcode 3107. Minimum Operations to Make Median of Array Equal to K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3107)
### Problem Statement

We are not given a specific problem statement from LeetCode with the ID 3107. Hence, we will proceed by formulating a plausible problem statement based on the title "Minimum Operations to Make Median of Array Equal to K".

**Problem Statement:**

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `K`, you need to make the median of the array equal to `K`. You are allowed to perform operations where you can change any integer in the array to any other integer. Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to achieve this.

The median is the middle element of a sorted array (if the array has an odd number of elements) or the average of the two middle elements (if the array has an even number of elements).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Can the array have duplicate elements?**
   **A: Yes, the array can have duplicate elements.**

2. **Q: Do we need to modify the array in place or is a new array acceptable?**
   **A: A new array or in-place modification â€” either approach is acceptable as long as we find the minimum operations.**

3. **Q: Are there any constraints on the size of the array or values within it?**
   **A: Typically, the constraints would be provided; we will assume a reasonable size (e.g., `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5` and `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`).**

4. **Q: If the array has an even number of elements, do we need to consider the rounded value of the median when it is a fraction?**
   **A: To make the problem simpler, we will assume we only change elements to `K` such that the overall median of the array (after operations) equals `K`.

### Example
```java
Input: nums = [1, 3, 2, 5, 4], K = 3
Output: 1
Explanation: By changing the 4 to a 3, the array becomes [1, 3, 2, 5, 3], and the median is now 3.
```

### Strategy

1. **Identify Median:**
   Determine the current median of the array since the median calculation will help identify how far we need to modify values to reach `K`.

2. **Determine Changes:**
   Count the minimum changes required to make the median of the array equal to `K`. There are two scenarios:
   - If the current median is already `K`, no changes are necessary.
   - If not, changes need to be made primarily to the elements around the median value to shift it towards `K`.

3. **Sorting:**
   Sort the array to easily locate the median position and then change the necessary elements towards `K`.

### Code Implementation

Here is a possible Java implementation for the given problem:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MinimumOperationsToMakeMedianEqualK {
    
    public static int minOperations(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Sort the array to find the median easily
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int n = nums.length;
        int median = (n % 2 == 0) ? nums[n/2 - 1] : nums[n/2];

        if (median == k)
            return 0;

        int operations = 0;
        if (n % 2 == 1) {
            int midIndex = n / 2;
            nums[midIndex] = k; // change the median itself to k
            operations++;
        } else {
            // Two values that contribute to the median in case of even length
            int leftMidIndex = n / 2 - 1;
            int rightMidIndex = n / 2;
            nums[leftMidIndex] = k;
            nums[rightMidIndex] = k;
            operations += 2;
        }

        return operations;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums1 = {1, 3, 2, 5, 4};
        int k1 = 3;
        System.out.println(minOperations(nums1, k1)); // Output: 1

        int[] nums2 = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        int k2 = 3;
        System.out.println(minOperations(nums2, k2)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the array takes \(O(n \log n)\), which is the most time-consuming part.
- Finding and changing the median elements has \(O(1)\) time complexity.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

This implementation ensures that we find the minimum number of operations to make the median of the array equal to the given integer \(K\).
