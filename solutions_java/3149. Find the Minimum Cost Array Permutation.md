[Leetcode 3149. Find the Minimum Cost Array Permutation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3149)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays of the same length `A` and `B`. Your task is to permute array `A` such that the sum of the product of corresponding elements of `A` and `B` is minimized.

To clarify, given:
- Arrays `A` and `B` of length `n`
- The goal is to find a permutation `P` of `A` that minimizes the sum `Σ(A'[i] * B[i])` for `i` from `0` to `n-1`, where `A'` is the permuted version of `A` as per permutation `P`.

### Clarifying Questions

Before jumping into the solution, let’s clarify and confirm understanding of the problem:

1. **Constraints on Array Elements:**
   - What are the possible ranges of elements in arrays `A` and `B`? (e.g., positive/negative, upper/lower limits).
2. **Constraints on Array Length:**
   - What is the range of the length of arrays `A` and `B`? (Is it up to `10^5` or more?)
3. **Output:**
   - Should we return the minimized sum or the permuted array `A'`?
4. **Unique Elements:**
   - Are elements in arrays `A` and `B` guaranteed to be unique?
   
For this example, let's assume:
- Elements in arrays `A` and `B` are integers within the range `[-10^4, 10^4]`.
- The length of arrays `A` and `B` is up to `10^5`.
- We need to return the minimized sum.
- Elements can be repeated in arrays `A` and `B`.

### Strategy

To minimize the sum `Σ(A'[i] * B[i])`, the intuition is to pair the smallest numbers from `A` with the largest numbers from `B` and vice versa. This works due to the fact that multiplying a large magnitude number with a small magnitude number will yield a smaller product compared to multiplying two large magnitude numbers.

**Steps:**

1. Sort array `A`.
2. Sort array `B` in descending order.
3. Calculate the sum of the products of corresponding elements from the sorted `A` and `sorted B`.

### Code

Let’s implement this strategy in Java:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MinimumCostArrayPermutation {
    public static int minCostPermutation(int[] A, int[] B) {
        // Sort array A in ascending order
        Arrays.sort(A);
        
        // Sort array B in descending order
        Arrays.sort(B);
        for (int i = 0; i < B.length / 2; i++) {
            int temp = B[i];
            B[i] = B[B.length - 1 - i];
            B[B.length - 1 - i] = temp;
        }
        
        // Calculate the minimized sum product
        int minSum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {
            minSum += A[i] * B[i];
        }
        
        return minSum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] A = {1, 3, 5};
        int[] B = {2, 4, 6};
        System.out.println(minCostPermutation(A, B));  // Expected output: 32
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Sorting array `A` takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- Sorting array `B` takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- The rearrangement of `B` to descending order takes \(O(n)\).
- Calculating the sum takes \(O(n)\).

Hence, the total time complexity is:
\[ O(n \log n) \]

This is efficient for arrays with lengths up to \(10^5\).

### Conclusion

This solution effectively minimizes the sum of product of corresponding elements from arrays `A` and `B` by leveraging sorting techniques, ensuring a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\).
