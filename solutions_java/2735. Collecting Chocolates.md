[Leetcode 2735. Collecting Chocolates](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2735)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of integers `chocolates` representing the sweetness of chocolates. You have decided that today you will eat exactly one chocolate from this array, but you want to eat the sweetest chocolate left. Write a function that simulates this process and returns the order of the chocolate's sweetness you will eat each day. 

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input:** Is it guaranteed that the input array will contain at least one element? *(Yes)*
2. **Output:** Should the output be the order in which the sweetness of the chocolates is eaten? *(Yes)*
3. **Mutability:** Are we allowed to modify the input array? *(Yes, you can assume we can modify it if needed)*

### Strategy
1. **Sorting Approach:** We can sort the array in descending order, then return the elements in that order. This works because once sorted in descending order, we can simply iterate through the array front to back.

### Time Complexity
- Sorting the array will take \(O(n \log n)\).
- Iterating through the array to collect the order will take \(O(n)\).

Hence, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient given the problem constraints.

### Code
Here's the implementation of the approach:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Collections;

public class CollectingChocolates {
    public static int[] collectChocolates(int[] chocolates) {
        // Sort the array in descending order
        Arrays.sort(chocolates);
        // Create a new array to store the sweetness order
        int n = chocolates.length;
        int[] sweetnessOrder = new int[n];
        
        // Collect chocolates in reverse order (sweetest to least sweet)
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sweetnessOrder[i] = chocolates[n - 1 - i];
        }
        
        return sweetnessOrder;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test case
        int[] chocolates = {5, 3, 8, 1, 6};
        int[] result = collectChocolates(chocolates);
        
        // Print the result
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(result));  // Output: [8, 6, 5, 3, 1]
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Sorting:** First, we sort the `chocolates` array in ascending order.
2. **Reversing the Array:** We then iterate through the sorted array from the end to the beginning to simulate collecting the chocolates in descending order of sweetness.
3. **Output:** The resulting sweetness order is stored in a new array, which is then returned.

This ensures we always get the sweetest chocolate first and proceed in descending order of sweetness.
