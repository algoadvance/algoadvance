[Leetcode 2135. Count Words Obtained After Adding a Letter](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2135)
### Problem Statement
You are given two string arrays `startWords` and `targetWords`. Each string in `targetWords` is formed by adding exactly one letter to a string in `startWords`, then rearranging the letters of the new string in any order.

- For example, `star` can become `start` by adding a 't'.
- You need to return the number of strings in `targetWords` that can be obtained by adding a letter to a string in `startWords` and rearranging the letters.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size Constraints**: 
   - How large can the `startWords` and `targetWords` arrays be?
   - What is the maximum length for any given string in these arrays?
   
   *Typically, LeetCode mentions constraints, but for the sake of this problem, let's assume `startWords` and `targetWords` can each have up to 1000 strings, and each string can be up to 20 characters long.*

2. **Character Set**:
   - Are we only dealing with lowercase English letters?
   
   *Yes, typically for such problems, we deal with lowercase English letters only.*

3. **Duplicates**:
   - Can there be duplicate strings in either `startWords` or `targetWords`?
   
   *We'll assume duplicates are allowed, but they shouldn't affect the logic of the solution.*

### Strategy
Our approach will involve:
1. Creating a helper function to convert each word into a bit-mask representation of its character set. This helps in comparing and checking for differences efficiently.
2. Storing the bit-masks of all `startWords`.
3. For each word in `targetWords`, we will check if removing any one character and converting the resultant sequence to a bit-mask exists in the set of `startWords`.

### Code
```java
import java.util.*;

public class CountWords {
    
    // Function to convert a word into a bit mask
    private int bitmask(String word) {
        int mask = 0;
        for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
            mask |= 1 << (c - 'a');
        }
        return mask;
    }

    public int wordCount(String[] startWords, String[] targetWords) {
        Set<Integer> startWordMasks = new HashSet<>();
        
        // Convert all startWords to their bitmask representation and store in a set
        for (String word : startWords) {
            int mask = bitmask(word);
            startWordMasks.add(mask);
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        
        // Process each word in targetWords
        for (String target : targetWords) {
            int targetMask = bitmask(target);
            
            for (char c : target.toCharArray()) {
                int modifiedMask = targetMask & ~(1 << (c - 'a'));
                
                if (startWordMasks.contains(modifiedMask)) {
                    count++;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CountWords cw = new CountWords();
        String[] startWords = {"ant","act","tack"};
        String[] targetWords = {"tack","actt","tac","cat"};
        System.out.println(cw.wordCount(startWords, targetWords));  // Output: 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Converting a word to a bit mask**: 
  - This operation is \(O(L)\), where \(L\) is the length of the word.
- **Storing bitmasks of startWords**: 
  - Assuming `n` is the number of words in `startWords`, and each word has a maximum length `L`, this takes \(O(n \times L)\).
- **Checking targetWords**:
  - For each of the `m` targetWords, checking all `L` characters in each target word takes \(O(m \times L)\).
  
So, the total time complexity is \(O((n + m) \times L)\).

### Explanation
1. **Creating bitmasks**: 
   - We convert each word into a bitmask where each bit represents the presence of a character. This is efficient for comparison.
2. **Storing and checking masks**: 
   - We store all bitmasks of `startWords`. For each `targetWord`, we check whether removing any one character results in a bitmask present in `startWords`.
3. **Efficiency**: 
   - This method ensures we only perform a few operations per word, leading to efficient checks and minimal overhead.

This approach guarantees that we efficiently count valid `targetWords` based on `startWords` with a clear and maintainable code structure.
