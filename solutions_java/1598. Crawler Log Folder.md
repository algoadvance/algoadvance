[Leetcode 1598. Crawler Log Folder](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1598)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of strings `logs` where `logs[i]` is one of the following:
1. `"../"` - Move to the parent folder.
2. `"./"` - Remain in the current folder.
3. `"x/"` - Move to the child folder named `x`. This will always be a valid name (containing only alphanumeric characters).

The file system starts in the main folder, which is represented as the root or the starting point (`"/"`).

You need to determine the minimum number of operations required to go back to the main folder after executing all of the log operations.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the strings in `logs` always valid (i.e., do not move above the root directory)?
2. What is the maximum length of the `logs` array?

### Strategy

We will simulate the traversal of the file system using a counter to keep track of the depth of the current directory:
1. Start with a depth counter initialized to 0, representing the main folder.
2. Iterate through each log entry:
   - `"../"`: Decrease the depth by 1 (if depth > 0).
   - `"./"`: No change in depth.
   - `"x/"`: Increase the depth by 1.
3. The final value of the depth counter will be the minimum number of operations required to return to the main folder.

### Code
```java
public class CrawlerLogFolder {
    public int minOperations(String[] logs) {
        int depth = 0;
        
        for (String log : logs) {
            if (log.equals("../")) {
                if (depth > 0) depth--;
            } else if (!log.equals("./")) {
                depth++;
            }
        }
        
        return depth;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CrawlerLogFolder clf = new CrawlerLogFolder();
        
        String[] logs1 = {"d1/", "d2/", "../", "d21/", "./"};
        System.out.println(clf.minOperations(logs1));  // Output: 2
        
        String[] logs2 = {"d1/", "d2/", "./", "d3/", "../", "d31/"};
        System.out.println(clf.minOperations(logs2));  // Output: 3
        
        String[] logs3 = {"d1/", "../", "../", "../"};
        System.out.println(clf.minOperations(logs3));  // Output: 0
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The solution iterates through the `logs` array exactly once, making its time complexity:

- **Time Complexity: O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the `logs` array.

Since we only use a single counter to keep track of the depth, the space complexity is:

- **Space Complexity: O(1)**, constant space.
