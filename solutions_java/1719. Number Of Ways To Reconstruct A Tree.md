[Leetcode 1719. Number Of Ways To Reconstruct A Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1719)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `pairs`, where `pairs[i] = [a, b]` represents a bidirectional edge between nodes `a` and `b`. You need to determine if there is any way to reconstruct a unique binary tree that includes all edges in `pairs.` Return the number of ways to do so. If the answer is at least 2, return 2.

Here's a detailed description of the rules:
- You need to reconstruct a binary tree that contains each edge from `pairs` as an edge in your tree.
- The binary tree can have at most `n-1` edges if there are `n` nodes.
- You should return:
  - `1` if there is only one unique way to reconstruct the tree.
  - `2` if there are multiple ways to reconstruct the tree.
  - `0` if there is no way to reconstruct the tree.

### Example:

**Input:**
```
pairs = [[1,2],[2,3]]
```
**Output:**
```
1
```

**Input:**
```
pairs = [[1, 2], [2, 3], [1, 3]]
```
**Output:**
```
2
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What are the constraints on the values of nodes?
   **A:** Nodes are integers between `1` and `n`, where `n` is the number of unique nodes in the pairs.

2. **Q:** Are the edges bidirectional?
   **A:** Yes, the pairs represent bidirectional edges.

3. **Q:** Is it guaranteed that the input will describe a valid undirected graph?
   **A:** Yes, but it's not guaranteed that it will be a connected graph. 

## Strategy

To reconstruct a binary tree uniquely, we must determine if the given set of edges can form exactly one tree configuration. A binary tree uniquely reconstructable should fulfill the following criteria:

1. **Connectivity:** All nodes must be connected; otherwise, it can't be a single tree.
2. **Binary Tree Property:** Each node in the tree must have at most two children.
3. **Validity of tree structure:** Using the degrees of nodes and verifying that we don't form cycles or disconnected subGraphs.

To solve this problem:
1. Construct the adjacency list from the given pairs.
2. Check the number of connections (degree) for each node.
3. If any node has more than 2 connections, it's not a binary tree.
4. Use BFS or DFS to ensure connectivity and the constraints of being a binary tree.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class ReconstructBinaryTree {
    public int checkWays(int[][] pairs) {
        // Build the adjacency list
        Map<Integer, Set<Integer>> adjacencyList = new HashMap<>();
        for (int[] pair : pairs) {
            adjacencyList.computeIfAbsent(pair[0], k -> new HashSet<>()).add(pair[1]);
            adjacencyList.computeIfAbsent(pair[1], k -> new HashSet<>()).add(pair[0]);
        }
        
        // If there's only one node, it's trivially unique
        if (adjacencyList.size() <= 1) return 1;
        
        // Find the potential root (node with the highest degree)
        int root = -1;
        int maxDegree = 0;
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Set<Integer>> entry : adjacencyList.entrySet()) {
            if (entry.getValue().size() > maxDegree) {
                maxDegree = entry.getValue().size();
                root = entry.getKey();
            }
        }
        
        // If the max degree is less than the number of nodes minus one it's not a tree
        if (maxDegree < adjacencyList.size() - 1) return 0;
        
        boolean multipleWays = false;
        
        // Check if we can form a valid binary tree
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Set<Integer>> entry : adjacencyList.entrySet()) {
            int node = entry.getKey();
            Set<Integer> neighbors = entry.getValue();
            
            // Check if all neighbors of the current node are connected exactly to the node itself or a subset of its neighbors.
            for (int neighbor : neighbors) {
                Set<Integer> neighborConnections = new HashSet<>(adjacencyList.get(neighbor));
                neighborConnections.retainAll(neighbors);
                if (neighborConnections.size() < neighbors.size() - 1) {
                    return 0;
                }
                if (neighborConnections.size() == neighbors.size() - 1) {
                    multipleWays = true;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return multipleWays ? 2 : 1;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ReconstructBinaryTree solution = new ReconstructBinaryTree();
        int[][] pairs1 = // use example above
        int[][] pairs2 = // use example above
        
        System.out.println(solution.checkWays(pairs1));  // Output: 1
        System.out.println(solution.checkWays(pairs2));  // Output: 2
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity 

- Building the adjacency list takes \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of pairs.
- Verifying constraints requires iterating through the adjacency list and set operations, leading to a worst-case complexity of \(O(N^2)\).
- The overall time complexity is \(O(N^2)\).

This solution should efficiently solve the problem for reasonable input sizes.
