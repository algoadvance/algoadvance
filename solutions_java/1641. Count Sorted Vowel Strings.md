[Leetcode 1641. Count Sorted Vowel Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1641)
### Problem Statement
The problem statement is taken from LeetCode problem 1641. Count Sorted Vowel Strings:

Given an integer `n`, return the number of strings of length `n` that consist only of vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') and are lexicographically sorted.

A string `s` is lexicographically sorted if for all valid `i`, `s[i]` is the same as or comes before `s[i+1]` in the alphabet.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of n?**
   - The problem constraints must specify the range for n, typically \(1 \le n \le 50\).

2. **Are there any specific requirements on the output format?**
   - The output should be an integer representing the count of sorted vowel strings of length `n`.

3. **Can we assume the input `n` will always be a valid integer?**
   - Yes, per typical problem constraints.

### Strategy
We need to count strings of length `n` composed only of the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' that are lexicographically sorted. 

#### Dynamic Programming Decision
We can use Dynamic Programming (DP) to solve this problem. The idea is to use a table to keep track of the number of valid strings of different lengths and ending with different vowels:
- Let `dp[i][j]` represent the number of sorted strings of length `i` that end with the `j-th` vowel.
- We initialize for single-character strings: `dp[1][j] = 1` for all vowels since each vowel alone is lexicographically sorted.
- For strings of length greater than one, the transition depends on adding a vowel to a shorter string while maintaining lexicographic order.

Dynamic Programming Transition:
- For string length `i` for each vowel target `j`: `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i-1][j+1] + ... + dp[i-1][4]`

This results in populating the DP table and summing up the last row to get the answer.

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int countVowelStrings(int n) {
        // The dp array to store our intermediate results
        // dp[i] means the number of combinations we can have of length `i`
        // where `i` corresponds to the length, and `j` to the vowel count index
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][5];

        // Base case: For a string of length 1, all vowels are counted as 1 
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            dp[1][j] = 1;
        }

        // Iterate over the length of the strings from 2 to n
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
                // New dp value based on previous values
                for (int k = j; k < 5; k++) {
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i - 1][k];
                }
            }
        }

        // Sum all values for length `n`
        int result = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < 5; j++) {
            result += dp[n][j];
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n \times 5^2) \). The two nested loops contribute to the \( n \times 5 \) factor, since the operations inside the inner loop are O(5).
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(n \times 5) \). We are maintaining a 2D DP table of size \( n \times 5 \). 

This method efficiently counts the number of lexicographically sorted vowel strings of length `n`.
