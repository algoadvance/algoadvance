[Leetcode 872. Leaf](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l872)
### Problem Statement

Given two binary trees, return true if and only if they have the same leaf node sequence. Leaf nodes are defined as nodes with no children.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: root1 = [3,5,1,6,2,9,8,null,null,7,4], root2 = [3,5,1,6,7,4,2,null,null,null,null,null,null,9,8]
Output: true

Explanation:
The leaf sequence from both trees is [6, 7, 4, 9, 8].
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **How should the input trees be represented?**
   - The trees will be given as root nodes of `TreeNode` objects.
   
2. **What should be returned if both trees are empty?**
   - If both trees are empty, they are considered to have the same leaf sequence, so return `true`.

3. **What if only one of the trees is empty?**
   - If only one tree is empty, they cannot have the same leaf sequence, so return `false`.

### Strategy

To determine if two trees have the same leaf sequence, we can:

1. Implement a helper function to find the leaf nodes of a given tree.
2. Traverse both trees using a depth-first search (DFS) to collect their leaf nodes.
3. Compare the two sequences of leaf nodes.

### Code

Here's how you can implement this in Java:

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public boolean leafSimilar(TreeNode root1, TreeNode root2) {
        List<Integer> leaves1 = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Integer> leaves2 = new ArrayList<>();
        
        getLeaves(root1, leaves1);
        getLeaves(root2, leaves2);
        
        return leaves1.equals(leaves2);
    }
    
    private void getLeaves(TreeNode root, List<Integer> leaves) {
        if (root == null) {
            return;
        }
        
        if (root.left == null && root.right == null) {
            leaves.add(root.val);
        }
        
        getLeaves(root.left, leaves);
        getLeaves(root.right, leaves);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N) where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once to extract the leaf nodes.
- **Space Complexity:** O(L) where L is the number of leaf nodes. This space is used to store the leaf nodes of each tree.

### Explanation

1. **getLeaves:** This helper function recursively traverses the tree using DFS. When it encounters a leaf node (both left and right children are null), it adds the leaf node's value to the list.
2. **leafSimilar:** This function initializes two lists to store the leaves of each tree, calls `getLeaves` for both root nodes, and finally checks if the two lists are equal. If they are, the trees have the same leaf node sequence; otherwise, they don't.
