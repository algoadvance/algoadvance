[Leetcode 1312. Minimum Insertion Steps to Make a String Palindrome full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1312)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`. In one step you can insert any character at any index of the string. Return the minimum number of steps to make `s` a palindrome.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is a palindrome?**
    - A palindrome is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.
    
2. **What characters can the input string `s` consist of?**
    - The input string `s` will consist of lowercase English letters.

3. **What is the maximum length of the string `s`?**
    - The length of string `s` can be up to 500 characters.

## Strategy

**Dynamic Programming Approach**

To make a string a palindrome, we need to determine how far it is from already being a palindrome. One way to approach this is by using dynamic programming to find the longest palindromic subsequence (LPS) and then compute how many characters need to be added to make the entire string a palindrome.

### Steps

1. **Find Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LPS):**
    - Compute the length of the longest palindromic subsequence (LPS) of the string `s`.
    - Use dynamic programming to find the LPS. Let `dp[i][j]` represent the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring `s[i:j+1]`.

2. **Determine Minimum Insertions:**
    - The minimum number of insertions required will be the difference between the length of the string `s` and the length of the LPS.

### Dynamic Programming Table Entries

- If `s[i] == s[j]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 1`.
- Otherwise, `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of filling the DP table is \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`.

## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int minInsertions(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[n][n];
        
        // Build DP table
        for (int length = 1; length <= n; length++) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - length; i++) {
                int j = i + length - 1;
                if (length == 1) {
                    dp[i][j] = 1;
                } else if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j)) {
                    dp[i][j] = 2 + ((i+1 <= j-1) ? dp[i+1][j-1] : 0);
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        int lpsLength = dp[0][n-1];  // The length of the Longest Palindromic Subsequence
        return n - lpsLength;        // Minimum insertions needed
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Code

1. Initialize a DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence within the substring `s[i:j+1]`.

2. Fill the table from shorter substrings to longer substrings, ensuring smaller problems (substrings) are solved first.

3. For each substring `s[i:j+1]`:
   - If it's of length 1, it's trivially a palindrome of length 1.
   - If `s[i] == s[j]`, the length of the LPS can extend by including both characters.
   - If `s[i] != s[j]`, consider the maximum LPS length by either excluding the character `s[i]` or `s[j]`.

4. The final answer is the difference between the length of the input string `s` and the length of the longest palindromic subsequence found via the DP table.
