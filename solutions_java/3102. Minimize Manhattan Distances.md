[Leetcode 3102. Minimize Manhattan Distances](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3102)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer n representing the number of blocks on a straight line. Each block has an index from 0 to n-1. You are also given an array `points` of distinct integers, where each integer represents the index of a block that has a special point. You need to find a block index `idx` from 0 to n-1 such that the sum of Manhattan distances from `idx` to each index in `points` is minimized. If there are multiple possible answers, return the smallest index.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: n = 5, points = [0, 2, 4]
Output: 2
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can points array be empty?
   - **A:** No, points array will always contain at least one point.
   
2. **Q:** Can there be multiple blocks with the same Manhattan distance?
   - **A:** Yes, if there are multiple minimal distances, return the smallest index.

3. **Q:** What is the maximum value for n?
   - **A:** Typical constraints need to be checked (normally, constraints will be given in the problem to determine the efficient solution).

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Points:** First, sort the given points array.
2. **Calculate Median:** For minimizing the sum of absolute differences, the optimal point is the median of the sorted points. This is because the sum of the absolute deviations from the median is minimized compared to any other point.
3. **Edge Case:** If there are even number of points, any of the two middle elements can be chosen. However, we need to return the smallest index, hence choose the smaller median index in case of even number of points.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is `O(m log m)` where `m` is the number of special points, primarily due to the sorting step.
- Calculating the median and summing the distances are linear operations in `O(m)`.

### Code

```java
public class MinimizeManhattanDistances {
    public int minDistance(int n, int[] points) {
        // Sort the points array
        Arrays.sort(points);

        // Get the median point
        int medianIndex = points.length / 2;

        // If there are even points, the lower median index (smaller one) should be chosen
        int medianPoint = points[medianIndex];
        
        return medianPoint;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimizeManhattanDistances solver = new MinimizeManhattanDistances();
        
        int n1 = 5;
        int[] points1 = {0, 2, 4};
        System.out.println("Output: " + solver.minDistance(n1, points1)); // Output: 2

        int n2 = 6;
        int[] points2 = {1, 3, 5};
        System.out.println("Output: " + solver.minDistance(n2, points2)); // Output: 3
        
        int n3 = 4;
        int[] points3 = {0, 1, 2, 3};
        System.out.println("Output: " + solver.minDistance(n3, points3)); // Output: 1
    }
}
```

### Summary:

- Sort the points to make sure we pick the median correctly.
- Use the median as the optimal index to minimize Manhattan distances.
- If the length of the points array is even, choose the lower index of the two medians.

This ensures you get the minimum sum of Manhattan distances while adhering to the requirement of selecting the smallest index in case of ties.
