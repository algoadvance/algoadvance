[Leetcode 2454. Next Greater Element IV](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2454)
### Problem Statement:
You are given an integer array `nums`. For each element in `nums`, find the next greater element that occurs twice after the current position in the array.

Formally, the next greater element of `nums[i]` is the first greater element `nums[j]` such that `j` > `i + 2` (j is at least two indices away from i). If no such element exists, set the answer to `-1`.

Return an array `answer` such that `answer[i]` is the next greater element for `nums[i]`.

Example:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [2,1,2,4,3]
Output: [4,2,4,-1,-1]
Explanation:
- For index 0: 4 is the first element greater than 2 beyond index 2.
- For index 1: 2 is the first element greater than 1 beyond index 3.
- For index 2: 4 is the first element greater than 2 beyond index 4.
- For index 3 and 4: No elements greater than 4 and 3 respectively beyond their respective indexes.
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can `nums` contain negative integers? 
   - Yes, `nums` can contain negative integers.
2. What should be the size range of `nums`?
   - Assume that the size range of `nums` is from 1 to 10^5.
3. Is modifying the input array allowed?
   - No, you should not modify the input array.
4. Should we consider wrap-around elements?
   - No, only consider elements that are strictly beyond two indices away.

### Strategy:
1. Iterate through the array from right to left while using a stack to keep track of potential "next greater elements".
2. For each element, pop elements from the stack that are not greater than the current element.
3. Use the stack to find the valid "next greater element" for the current element.
4. Push the current element to the stack for future comparisons.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of the solution will be O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array, with an amortized O(1) work due to each operation (push and pop) being done at most once for each element.

### Code:
```java
import java.util.*;

public class NextGreaterElementIV {
    public int[] nextGreaterElement(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] result = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(result, -1);
        Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            // Remove elements not greater than nums[i] or not beyond i+2
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && (nums[stack.peek()] <= nums[i] || stack.peek() <= i + 2)) {
                stack.pop();
            }

            // If stack is not empty, the top element is the next greater element
            if (!stack.isEmpty()) {
                result[i] = nums[stack.peek()];
            }

            // Push current element's index into the stack
            stack.push(i);
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NextGreaterElementIV solution = new NextGreaterElementIV();
        int[] nums = {2, 1, 2, 4, 3};
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(solution.nextGreaterElement(nums))); // Output: [4, 2, 4, -1, -1]
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Stack Utilization**: This approach uses a stack to efficiently find the next greater element beyond the current element's position by ensuring that only relevant elements are considered (those beyond `i + 2` indices).
- **Filling `result` Array**: Iterate from right to left and update the `result` array during the process, ensuring that once an element's result is determined, it is pushed onto the stack for future comparisons.

This solution ensures that each element is processed in constant time on average, leading to an overall linear time complexity.
