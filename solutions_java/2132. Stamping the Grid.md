[Leetcode 2132. Stamping the Grid full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2132)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` matrix `grid` consisting of only integers `1` and `0`. We denote an operation as stamping the grid, which consists of the following steps:
1. Select a subgrid of the grid that matches the following configuration:

```
[1,1]
[1,1]
```

2. Set all the `1`s in this subgrid to `0`.

Return `true` if it is possible to stamp the entire `grid` (in one or more operations such that every cell is `0`). Otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

To understand the problem statement better, here are some clarifying questions:

1. **Size of the subgrid for stamping:** Can we assume the size of the subgrid is always 2x2?
   - Yes, the subgrid size for stamping is always 2x2 as per the problem statement.
   
2. **Initial state of the grid:** Should we assume that the grid always contains at least one `1`?
   - No, the grid can contain all `0`s initially. This case should simply return `true` since no stamping is needed.

3. **Non-stampable cells:** If a cell is part of multiple possible subgrids, should we consider it for each grid independently?
   - Yes, you need to find all possible 2x2 subgrids that can be stamped accordingly.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate Over the Grid:** We loop through the grid and look for 2x2 subgrids where all values are `1`.
2. **Stamp Subgrids:** For every valid 2x2 subgrid found, mark all its cells as `0` in a separate visited matrix.
3. **Check Each Cell:** After potential stamping, ensure no cell with `1` was left in the grid.

### Code

```java
public class StampingGrid {
    
    public boolean canStampGrid(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        boolean[][] stamped = new boolean[m][n];
        
        // Stamp every possible 2x2 subgrid
        for (int i = 0; i < m - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1 && grid[i][j+1] == 1 && grid[i+1][j] == 1 && grid[i+1][j+1] == 1) {
                    // Mark the cells as stamped
                    stamped[i][j] = true;
                    stamped[i][j+1] = true;
                    stamped[i+1][j] = true;
                    stamped[i+1][j+1] = true;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Check if all cells are stamped correctly
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1 && !stamped[i][j]) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] grid1 = {
            {1, 1, 0}, 
            {1, 1, 0}, 
            {0, 0, 1}
        };

        int[][] grid2 = {
            {1, 1, 1}, 
            {1, 1, 1}, 
            {1, 1, 1}
        };

        StampingGrid solution = new StampingGrid();
        System.out.println(solution.canStampGrid(grid1));  // Output: false
        System.out.println(solution.canStampGrid(grid2));  // Output: true
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(m * n)
  - We iterate through each cell of the `m x n` grid once to determine and stamp the 2x2 subgrids.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(m * n)
  - The additional boolean `stamped` matrix used might take the same amount of space as the `grid`.

This approach ensures we evaluate all cells for their potential in forming a subgrid and check if the entire grid can be set to 0 through valid stamping operations.
