[Leetcode 187. Repeated DNA Sequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l187)
### Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 187: **Repeated DNA Sequences**

Given a string `s` representing a DNA sequence, return all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. You may return the answer in any order.

**Example:**

- **Input:** `s = "AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"`
- **Output:** `["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"]`

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists of only 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are the characters in the string only 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'?
   **A:** Yes.

2. **Q:** Should the results be case-sensitive?
   **A:** Yes, the results should be in the same case as given (which is uppercase in the example).

3. **Q:** Can the substrings overlap?
   **A:** Yes, overlapping substrings are considered.

4. **Q:** Do we need to handle any special characters or whitespace?
   **A:** No, the problem guarantees that the input consists only of 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

### Strategy

1. **Sliding Window:** Use a sliding window of size 10 to traverse the string.
2. **Use of HashMap:** Utilize a HashMap (or dictionary) to count the occurrences of each 10-letter sequence.
3. **Set for Results:** Use a set to collect sequences that appear more than once to avoid duplicates.
4. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the length of `s` is less than 10, return an empty list since no sequence of 10 letters can be formed.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class RepeatedDNASequences {
    public List<String> findRepeatedDnaSequences(String s) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        if (s == null || s.length() < 10) {
            return result;
        }
        
        Map<String, Integer> sequenceCount = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= s.length() - 10; i++) {
            String sequence = s.substring(i, i + 10);
            sequenceCount.put(sequence, sequenceCount.getOrDefault(sequence, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : sequenceCount.entrySet()) {
            if (entry.getValue() > 1) {
                result.add(entry.getKey());
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RepeatedDNASequences solution = new RepeatedDNASequences();
        System.out.println(solution.findRepeatedDnaSequences("AAAAACCCCCAAAAACCCCCCAAAAAGGGTTT"));
        // Output: ["AAAAACCCCC", "CCCCCAAAAA"]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. The for loop runs `n-9` times, each taking constant time due to substring extraction and hashmap operations.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string. This is due to the space needed for the hashmap to store all possible 10-letter sequences of the string.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find all repeated 10-letter-long DNA sequences while maintaining optimal performance.
