[Leetcode 2320. Count Number of Ways to Place Houses full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2320)
## Problem Statement

You are given a plot with `n` sections, and you need to place houses in such a way that no two houses are adjacent to each other. Each section can either be empty or have a house, but no two sections with houses can be next to each other.

Determine the number of ways to place houses in `n` sections.

### Example
- For `n = 3`, the combinations are:
  - Place a house in the first section, leave the second section empty, and place a house in the third: `H E H`
  - Place a house in the first section, leave the second and third sections empty: `H E E`
  - Leave the first section empty, place a house in the second section, and leave the third empty: `E H E`
  - Leave the first and second sections empty, place a house in the third: `E E H`
  - Leave all sections empty: `E E E`

Thus, for `n = 3`, there are 5 ways to place the houses.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can there be more than one house in a section?**
   - No, each section can either have one house or be empty.
   
2. **What is the input type and range of `n`?**
   - The input `n` is an integer where `0 <= n <= 1000`.

3. **What should be returned if `n = 0`?**
   - If `n = 0`, there is only one way, which means placing no houses.

## Strategy
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. The idea is to define a state `dp[i]` representing the number of ways to place houses in the first `i` sections such that no two houses are adjacent. 

To compute `dp[i]`, consider two choices:
1. Place a house in the `i-th` section, which means the `(i-1)-th` section must be empty.
2. Leave the `i-th` section empty.

Using these choices, the recurrence relation for `dp[i]` is:
- `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]`

Where:
- `dp[i-1]` is the number of ways to arrange houses in the first `i-1` sections with the `i-th` section empty.
- `dp[i-2]` represents placing a house in the `i-th` section, thus the `(i-1)` must be empty, and we look at `i-2`.

The base cases:
- `dp[0] = 1` (empty plot scenario)
- `dp[1] = 2` (either empty or just one house)

The total number of ways for `n` sections is `dp[n]`.

## Code

```java
public class HousePlacements {
    public int countHousePlacements(int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 1;
        if (n == 1) return 2;
        
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 1;
        dp[1] = 2;
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HousePlacements solution = new HousePlacements();
        System.out.println(solution.countHousePlacements(3));  // Output: 5
        System.out.println(solution.countHousePlacements(4));  // Output: 8
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n) since we iterate from 2 to `n` to fill the `dp` array. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the storage of the `dp` array.
