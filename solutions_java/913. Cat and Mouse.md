[Leetcode 913. Cat and Mouse](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l913)
## Problem Statement:
A game on an undirected graph is played by two players, Mouse and Cat, who alternate turns.

The graph is given as follows:
- `graph[a]` is a list of all nodes `b` such that `a` and `b` are connected.
- The Mouse starts at node `1` and the Cat starts at node `2`. There is also a Hole at node `0`.

During each player's turn, they must travel along one edge of the graph. Additionally, the Cat cannot move to the hole node `0`.

You need to determine the result of the game assuming both players play optimally:
- If the Mouse wins, return 1.
- If the Cat wins, return 2.
- If the game is a draw, return 0.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Graph Representation**: Is the graph given as an adjacency list, and is it guaranteed to be connected?
2. **Player Moves**: The Mouse always starts first. Do both players have to make a move every turn if possible?
3. **Initial Positions**: Mouse always starts at node `1` and Cat at node `2`, correct?
4. **Constraints**: Are there any constraints like maximum nodes or edges in the graph?

## Code:
```java
import java.util.*;

public class CatAndMouse {
    
    private static final int MOUSE_TURN = 0;
    private static final int CAT_TURN = 1;
    
    public int catMouseGame(int[][] graph) {
        int n = graph.length;
        int[][][] dp = new int[n][n][2 * n];
        
        for (int[][] matrix : dp) {
            for (int[] row : matrix) {
                Arrays.fill(row, -1);
            }
        }
        
        return solve(graph, dp, MOUSE_TURN, 1, 2, 0);
    }
    
    private int solve(int[][] graph, int[][][] dp, int turn, int mouse, int cat, int moves) {
        if (moves == 2 * graph.length) return 0;
        if (mouse == 0) return 1;
        if (cat == mouse) return 2;
        if (dp[mouse][cat][moves] != -1) return dp[mouse][cat][moves];
        
        if (turn == MOUSE_TURN) {
            boolean mouseWins = false;
            boolean drawExists = false;
            for (int next : graph[mouse]) {
                int result = solve(graph, dp, CAT_TURN, next, cat, moves + 1);
                if (result == 1) mouseWins = true;
                if (result == 0) drawExists = true;
                if (mouseWins) break;
            }
            if (mouseWins) {
                dp[mouse][cat][moves] = 1;
            } else if (drawExists) {
                dp[mouse][cat][moves] = 0;
            } else {
                dp[mouse][cat][moves] = 2;
            }
        } else {
            boolean catWins = false;
            boolean drawExists = false;
            for (int next : graph[cat]) {
                if (next == 0) continue;
                int result = solve(graph, dp, MOUSE_TURN, mouse, next, moves + 1);
                if (result == 2) catWins = true;
                if (result == 0) drawExists = true;
                if (catWins) break;
            }
            if (catWins) {
                dp[mouse][cat][moves] = 2;
            } else if (drawExists) {
                dp[mouse][cat][moves] = 0;
            } else {
                dp[mouse][cat][moves] = 1;
            }
        }
        return dp[mouse][cat][moves];
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CatAndMouse solution = new CatAndMouse();
        int[][] graph = {
            {2,5},
            {3},
            {0,4,5},
            {1,4,5},
            {2,3},
            {0,2,3}
        };
        System.out.println(solution.catMouseGame(graph));  // Example case
    }
}
```

## Strategy:
1. **Dynamic Programming and DFS**: We will use a 3D DP array where `dp[mouse][cat][turns]` stores the result of the game when the mouse is at node `mouse`, the cat is at node `cat`, and `turns` have been made.
2. **Base Cases**:
    - If the mouse reaches the hole (node 0), the mouse wins.
    - If the cat catches the mouse (both at the same node), the cat wins.
    - If the number of moves reaches `2 * n`, declare it as a draw.
3. **Recursive DP**:
    - On the mouse's turn, try all possible moves for the mouse.
    - On the cat's turn, try all possible moves for the cat, avoiding the hole.
4. **Optimization**: Use memoization to avoid recalculating results for the same state.

## Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n^3)` because we have three dimensions n (number of nodes) by n by 2n.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n^3)` for the DP table.

This solution leverages DP and memoization to efficiently calculate the result of the game, ensuring both players play optimally.
