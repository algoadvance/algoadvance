[Leetcode 2699. Modify Graph Edge Weights](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2699)
## Problem Statement

You are given an undirected weighted connected graph containing `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, and a 2D array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi, wi]` denotes that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` with weight `wi`.

Some edges have a weight of `-1` (wi == -1), meaning that their weight is unknown (`-1` weight denotes uncertainty). 

Your task is to modify all edges with a weight of `-1` such that the shortest distance between nodes `source` and `destination` is exactly `target`. 

If there are multiple valid ways to modify the edge weights, return any of them. If there is no way to modify the edges to meet this requirement, return an empty array.

## Example:

- Given graph:
  - `edges = [[0, 1, -1], [0, 2, 2], [1, 2, 3]]`
  - `n = 3`
  - `source = 0`
  - `destination = 2`
  - `target = 4`

- Expected Output: Modified edges such as `[[0, 1, 1], [0, 2, 2], [1, 2, 3]]`

## Clarifying Questions:

1. Can the graph have multiple edges between the same pair of nodes?
2. How do we handle the situation where there are no valid modifications possible?
3. Should we return the modified edges in the same order as they appear in the input?
4. Should we ensure the graph remains connected after modifying the edges?

## Strategy:

1. **Initialization and Input Validation**:
   - Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the current shortest path from the `source` node to all other nodes.

2. **Identify the Uncertainty**:
   - Locate edges with a weight of `-1` that need to be modified.

3. **Modify the Edges**:
   - Adjust the weights of `-1` edges to ensure the shortest path between `source` and `destination` equals `target`.

4. **Validation**:
   - After modifying the edges, validate using Dijkstra's algorithm to confirm the shortest path between `source` and `destination` equals `target`.

5. **Return Result**:
   - If the target distance is achieved, return the modified edges. Otherwise, return an empty array.

## Code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class ModifyGraphEdgeWeights {
    static class Edge {
        int node, weight;
        Edge(int node, int weight) {
            this.node = node;
            this.weight = weight;
        }
    }

    public List<int[]> modifyGraphEdges(int n, List<int[]> edges, int source, int destination, int target) {
        List<int[]> modifiedEdges = new ArrayList<>();
        List<int[]> result = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Edge>[] graph = new List[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            graph[edge[0]].add(new Edge(edge[1], edge[2]));
            graph[edge[1]].add(new Edge(edge[0], edge[2]));
            if (edge[2] == -1) modifiedEdges.add(edge);
        }

        int[] distances = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(distances, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        distances[source] = 0;
        PriorityQueue<Edge> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(e -> e.weight));
        pq.offer(new Edge(source, 0));

        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            Edge current = pq.poll();
            if (current.weight > distances[current.node]) continue;
            for (Edge neighbor : graph[current.node]) {
                int newDist = current.weight + (neighbor.weight == -1 ? 1 : neighbor.weight);
                if (newDist < distances[neighbor.node]) {
                    distances[neighbor.node] = newDist;
                    pq.offer(new Edge(neighbor.node, newDist));
                }
            }
        }

        if (distances[destination] < target) return Collections.emptyList();

        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            if (edge[2] == -1) edge[2] = target + 1;
            result.add(edge);
        }
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<int[]> edges = new ArrayList<>();
        edges.add(new int[]{0, 1, -1});
        edges.add(new int[]{0, 2, 2});
        edges.add(new int[]{1, 2, 3});
        ModifyGraphEdgeWeights obj = new ModifyGraphEdgeWeights();
        List<int[]> result = obj.modifyGraphEdges(3, edges, 0, 2, 4);
        for (int[] edge : result) {
            System.out.println(Arrays.toString(edge));
        }
    }
}
```

## Explanation and Time Complexity:

### Explanation:
- **Graph Construction**:
  - Convert edge list to adjacency list.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**:
  - Calculate the shortest paths from `source` to all nodes.
- **Edge Modification**:
  - Adjust edges initially marked with `-1`.
- **Final Validation**:
  - Ensure the modified shortest path meets the `target`.

### Time Complexity:
- Constructing the graph takes `O(E)` time where `E` is the number of edges.
- Dijkstra's algorithm runs in `O(E + V log V)` time where `V` is the number of vertices.
- Modifying edges is linear in the number of `-1` edges.

Thus, overall complexity: `O(E + V log V)`.
