### Problem Statement
LeetCode Problem 297: Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree

Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**Clarifying Questions:**
1. Can the tree contain negative values?
   - Yes.
2. Are there any constraints on the size or structure of the tree?
   - No specific constraints mentioned.

### Strategy
To solve the problem, we will implement the following:

**Serialization:**
1. Use level-order traversal (BFS) to convert the tree into a string.
2. Store each node's value in the string, using "null" for null children to preserve structure.

**Deserialization:**
1. Parse the string back into values.
2. Rebuild the tree using a queue to manage the parent-child relationships.

### Code
Here's the Java code for both serialization and deserialization functions:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Codec {
    // Serializes a tree to a single string.
    public String serialize(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return "[]";
        
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        result.append("[");
        
        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(root);
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            TreeNode current = queue.poll();
            if (current != null) {
                result.append(current.val).append(",");
                queue.add(current.left);
                queue.add(current.right);
            } else {
                result.append("null,");
            }
        }
        
        // Remove the trailing comma and add the closing bracket.
        result.setLength(result.length() - 1);
        result.append("]");
        
        return result.toString();
    }

    // Deserializes encoded data to tree.
    public TreeNode deserialize(String data) {
        if (data.equals("[]")) return null;
        
        String[] values = data.substring(1, data.length() - 1).split(",");
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(Integer.parseInt(values[0]));
        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(root);
        
        int index = 1;
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            TreeNode current = queue.poll();
            if (!values[index].equals("null")) {
                TreeNode leftChild = new TreeNode(Integer.parseInt(values[index]));
                current.left = leftChild;
                queue.add(leftChild);
            }
            index++;
            
            if (!values[index].equals("null")) {
                TreeNode rightChild = new TreeNode(Integer.parseInt(values[index]));
                current.right = rightChild;
                queue.add(rightChild);
            }
            index++;
        }
        
        return root;
    }
}

class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Serialize:**
  - The time complexity for serialization is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once.

- **Deserialize:**
  - The time complexity for deserialization is also **O(n)**, as we again visit each node exactly once to reconstruct the tree.

### Additional Notes
- Both methods efficiently handle null values and ensure the tree structure is correctly preserved during serialization and deserialization.
- The use of level-order traversal ensures that even unbalanced trees are handled correctly.
