[Leetcode 541. Reverse String II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l541)
## Problem Statement

### 541. Reverse String II

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, reverse the first `k` characters for every `2k` characters counting from the start of the string.

If there are fewer than `k` characters left, reverse all of them. If there are less than `2k` but greater than or equal to `k` characters, then reverse the first `k` characters and leave the other as original.

### Examples:

1. Input: `s = "abcdefg", k = 2`
   Output: `"bacdfeg"`

2. Input: `s = "abcd", k = 2`
   Output: `"bacd"`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the value of `k` or the length of string `s`?
   **A:** The length of `s` will be between 1 and 10000. `k` will be a positive integer.

2. **Q:** What are the characters contained in the string `s`?
   **A:** The string `s` consists of lower English letters only.

## Strategy

1. Iterate over the string `s` in chunks of `2k`.
2. For each chunk:
   - Reverse the first `k` characters.
   - Leave the rest `2k - k` characters as they are.
3. If any chunk has fewer than `k` characters left, simply reverse them.

## Code

Let's implement this now:

```java
public class Solution {
    public String reverseStr(String s, int k) {
        char[] arr = s.toCharArray();
        for (int start = 0; start < arr.length; start += 2 * k) {
            int i = start, j = Math.min(start + k - 1, arr.length - 1);
            while (i < j) {
                char temp = arr[i];
                arr[i++] = arr[j];
                arr[j--] = temp;
            }
        }
        return new String(arr);
    }

    // Main method for testing
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.reverseStr("abcdefg", 2)); // Output: "bacdfeg"
        System.out.println(sol.reverseStr("abcd", 2));    // Output: "bacd"
    }
}
```

## Explanation of Code

1. Convert the string `s` to a character array `arr` to allow in-place modifications.
2. Iterate through the character array in increments of `2 * k`.
3. For each segment of `2 * k`:
   - Reverse the first `k` characters using two pointers technique.
   - Adjust the pointers until `i` meets `j` to ensure the segment is reversed properly.
4. Convert the character array back to a string and return the result.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`:

- We iterate through the string once with pointer increment strategy.
- Reversing part of the string (first `k` characters) is an \(O(k)\) operation, but considering it happens within the loop, the overall time complexity remains linear in terms of string length.

The space complexity is \(O(n)\) only due to the conversion of the string to a character array, which is necessary to perform in-place modification in Java. Apart from this, the algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for variables.
