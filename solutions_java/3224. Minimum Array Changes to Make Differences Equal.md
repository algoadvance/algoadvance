[Leetcode 3224. Minimum Array Changes to Make Differences Equal full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3224)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. In one move, you can pick any two indices `i` and `j` (0 <= i < j <= nums.length - 1) such that `nums[i] != nums[j]` and set `nums[i] = nums[j]`. Your task is to find the minimum number of moves needed to make all pairwise differences equal.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of values in nums and k**: Are there any constraints on the range of values that can be in `nums` or the value of `k`?
2. **Length of the array**: What is the maximum length of the array `nums`?
3. **Output for edge cases**: How should the function behave if the length of nums is 1 or if `k` is zero?

Assumptions:
- `k` is an integer within the range of the values in `nums`.
- `nums` has at least 1 element and at most 10^5 elements.

## Strategy

1. **Count Occurrences of Each Element**: First, count the occurrences of each element in the `nums` array.
2. **Calculate Pair Differences**: As we want to achieve the goal of making all pairwise differences equal, we need to find the most frequent difference and minimize changes to match that frequency.
3. **Optimal Moves Calculation**: Calculate the minimum moves required to make all elements match the most frequent difference by aligning `nums` elements accordingly.

## Code

Here's a Java function to solve the problem:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class MinimumArrayChanges {

    public int minChanges(int[] nums, int k) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();
        int maxFrequency = 0;

        // Count frequency of each element in nums
        for (int num : nums) {
            frequencyMap.put(num, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
            maxFrequency = Math.max(maxFrequency, frequencyMap.get(num));
        }

        // Minimum changes required is the number of elements minus the frequency of the most common element
        return nums.length - maxFrequency;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumArrayChanges solution = new MinimumArrayChanges();
        
        // Example usage
        int[] nums1 = {1, 2, 2, 1, 2};
        int k1 = 1;
        System.out.println(solution.minChanges(nums1, k1));  // Output should be 2

        int[] nums2 = {3, 3, 1, 1, 2};
        int k2 = 5;
        System.out.println(solution.minChanges(nums2, k2));  // Output should be 3
    }
}
```

## Explanation

1. **Count Occurrences**: We use a HashMap to count occurrences of each element in `nums`.
2. **Determine Most Frequent Element**: The element with the highest frequency is the one that requires the least changes to make other elements equal to it.
3. **Calculate Minimum Changes**: The minimum number of changes is the total number of elements minus the maximum frequency of any single element (`nums.length - maxFrequency`).

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the array `nums`. This is because we are iterating through the array once to populate the frequency map and then iterating through the map to find the maximum frequency.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), due to the space required for the HashMap to store the frequency of each element. The worst case is when all elements in `nums` are distinct.
