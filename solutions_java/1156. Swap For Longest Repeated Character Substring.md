### Problem Statement

Leetcode 1156: "Swap For Longest Repeated Character Substring"

Given a string `text`, you are allowed to swap two characters to form the longest possible substring of the same character. Return the length of such a substring.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all characters in the input string lowercase letters?**
   - Yes, as per the standard constraints of the problem.
   
2. **Can the string be empty?**
   - Yes, but according to problem constraints, we can assume non-empty strings for the main solution.

3. **Are repeated characters and swapped characters counted toward the length of the resulting substring?**
   - Yes, you just need to return the length of the longest possible substring after one optimal swap.

### Strategy

1. **Group Characters and Calculate Frequencies:**
   - Use a list of tuples to store consecutive groups of characters and their lengths in the format `(char, length)`.

2. **Identify the Character Frequencies:**
   - Use a dictionary to store the frequency of each character in the entire string.

3. **Determine Maximum Substring Length:**
   - Iterate through the grouped character list and calculate the maximum possible length by considering swaps in adjacent and separated groups while respecting the frequency availability.

4. **Two Main Scenarios to Consider for Swaps:**
   - *Direct Adjacent Groups:* Combine lengths of the same character groups directly adjacent to each other.
   - *Separated by One Character:* Combine lengths of same character blocks separated by exactly one different character, considering if we have an extra of that character available in total.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int maxRepOpt1(String text) {
        // Group consecutive characters and their counts
        List<int[]> groups = new ArrayList<>();
        Map<Character, Integer> charFrequency = new HashMap<>();
        char[] arr = text.toCharArray();
        int n = arr.length;

        // Group the characters and calculate frequencies
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ) {
            char c = arr[i];
            int start = i;
            while (i < n && arr[i] == c) {
                i++;
            }
            int count = i - start;
            groups.add(new int[]{c - 'a', count});
            charFrequency.put(c, charFrequency.getOrDefault(c, 0) + count);
        }

        int maxLen = 0;

        // Calculate max length considering possible swaps
        for (int i = 0; i < groups.size(); i++) {
            int[] group = groups.get(i);
            char c = (char) (group[0] + 'a');
            int count = group[1];
            int potentialLength = count;

            // If there are more of this character elsewhere for potential swap
            if (charFrequency.get(c) > count) {
                potentialLength++;
            }

            // Merge with adjacent groups
            if (i > 0 && groups.get(i-1)[0] == group[0]) {
                potentialLength = Math.max(potentialLength, groups.get(i-1)[1] + group[1] + (charFrequency.get(c) > (groups.get(i-1)[1] + group[1]) ? 1 : 0));
            }

            // Consider case where the same character groups are separated by one different character
            if (i > 0 && i < groups.size() - 1 && groups.get(i-1)[0] == group[0] && i < groups.size() - 1 && groups.get(i+1)[0] == group[0]) {
                int combinedLength = groups.get(i-1)[1] + group[1] + groups.get(i+1)[1];
                if (charFrequency.get((char) group[0] + 'a') > combinedLength - group[1]) {
                    potentialLength = Math.max(potentialLength, combinedLength + 1);
                } else {
                    potentialLength = Math.max(potentialLength, combinedLength);
                }
            }

            // Update result with the best possible length for this character
            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, potentialLength);
        }

        return maxLen;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Grouping Phase:** O(n) where `n` is the length of the string.
2. **Frequency Calculation:** O(n) because it iterates through the string.
3. **Calculating Max Length:** O(m) where `m` is the number of groups.

Overall, the time complexity is O(n) since grouping and frequency calculation do linear scanning, followed by a linear scan through the groups.
