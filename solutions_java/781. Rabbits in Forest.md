[Leetcode 781. Rabbits in Forest](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l781)
## Problem Statement:

In a forest, each rabbit has some color. Some rabbits tell you how many other rabbits have the same color as them. You are given an integer array `answers`, where `answers[i]` is the answer of the `i-th` rabbit.

Return the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. What does `answers[i] == 0` mean?
   - If `answers[i] == 0`, it means that the rabbit claims it is the only rabbit with that color.
   
2. Are there any constraints or limits on the length of the `answers` array or the numbers within it?
   - The array `answers` will have a length in the range [1, 1000], and each element will be an integer in the range [0, 1000].

3. Are we provided any additional context about the colors or should we infer it purely based on the answers?
   - We should infer the number of rabbits purely based on the `answers` array without additional context about the colors.

## Strategy:

1. **Group the rabbits by their answers**: We'll use a hashmap to count how many rabbits gave each particular answer.
2. **Calculate the number of rabbits for each group**:
   - For each distinct answer `y`, if there are `x` rabbits that say there are `y` other rabbits of the same color, this means there are at most `y + 1` rabbits of that color.
   - If there are more than `y + 1` such rabbits, those must overflow into another group of `y + 1` rabbits.
   - We can calculate the minimum number of rabbits needed for each group by using the ceiling of the division of the rabbit count by `y + 1` (i.e., `(count + y) // (y + 1) * (y + 1)`).

## Code:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class RabbitsInForest {
    public int numRabbits(int[] answers) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> answerCount = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Count the occurrences of each answer
        for (int answer : answers) {
            answerCount.put(answer, answerCount.getOrDefault(answer, 0) + 1);
        }

        int minRabbits = 0;

        // Calculate the minimum number of rabbits for each answer group
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : answerCount.entrySet()) {
            int y = entry.getKey();
            int count = entry.getValue();
            
            // Calculate group size which is y + 1
            int groupSize = y + 1;
            
            // Calculate the number of groups needed
            int groups = (count + groupSize - 1) / groupSize;
            
            // Add the total number of rabbits in these groups
            minRabbits += groups * groupSize;
        }
        
        return minRabbits;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RabbitsInForest rif = new RabbitsInForest();
        int[] answers = {1, 1, 2};
        System.out.println(rif.numRabbits(answers));  // Output: 5
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:

- **Counting occurrences in the hashmap**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array `answers`.
- **Calculating minimum rabbits**: O(k), where k is the number of different answers.
- Overall, the time complexity is O(n), given that n dominates k in the worst case (when every rabbit gives a unique answer).

This efficient approach ensures that we capture the least number of rabbits as inferred from their answers while adhering to the logic provided.
