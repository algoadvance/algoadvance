[Leetcode 201. Bitwise AND of Numbers Range](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l201)
### Problem Statement

Given two integers `left` and `right` that represent the range `[left, right]`, return the **bitwise AND** of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

#### Example:
1. Input: left = 5, right = 7
   Output: 4

2. Input: left = 0, right = 1
   Output: 0

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Will the integers always be non-negative?**
   - Yes.
2. **Can the range be very large?**
   - Yes, the range can be large, so efficiency is important.
3. **What are the constraints?**
   - \(0 \leq left \leq right \leq 2^{31} - 1\)

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - To find the bitwise AND of all numbers between `left` and `right`, one approach could be to perform the bitwise AND operation iteratively on each number in the range. However, this might be inefficient for large ranges.

2. **Efficient Approach**:
   - Observe that common bits in the result must be the same for all numbers in the range.
   - As numbers increase in a range, lower bits will eventually cycle through 0 and 1, and only the higher, unchanging bits will remain stable after ANDing.
   - We can find the common high bits of `left` and `right` by shifting both to the right until they are equal. The remaining bits after shifting left back to the original places will form the result.
   
3. **Steps to Implement**:
   - Initialize two variables `left` and `right`.
   - While `left` is not equal to `right`, right shift both `left` and `right` until they are equal.
   - Count the number of shifts, which gives us how many bits we have to 'zero out'.
   - Left shift the new value of `left` back to its position to get the result.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int rangeBitwiseAnd(int left, int right) {
        // Count the number of shifts
        int shift = 0;
        while (left < right) {
            left >>= 1;
            right >>= 1;
            shift++;
        }
        // Shift the result back to its original position
        return left << shift;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(log n), where n is the difference between `left` and `right`. This is because the number of shifts will be proportional to the number of bits in the binary representation of `right`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), we are using a constant amount of extra space.

### Explanation

1. `left` and `right` are right-shifted until they become equal:
   - This effectively eliminates bits that differ between `left` and `right`.
2. The variable `shift` counts how many bits have been shifted out.
3. Finally, the left variable is left-shifted back to its original position to form the correct result.

This method ensures that we perform the necessary bitwise operations efficiently without having to AND every number in the range.
