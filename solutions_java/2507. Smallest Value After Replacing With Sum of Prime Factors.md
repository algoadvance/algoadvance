[Leetcode 2507. Smallest Value After Replacing With Sum of Prime Factors](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2507)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, you need to replace `n` with the sum of its prime factors repeatedly until `n` no longer changes. Return the smallest value `n` that is obtained after such replacements.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the expected input range?**
   - The problem doesn't specify an input range but typically, LeetCode problems handle up to \(n \leq 10^9\).

2. **What should be returned when `n` is already a prime?**
   - If `n` is already a prime and doesn't change after replacements, it should be returned as it is.

3. **Are there any specific constraints or edge cases?**
   - Edge cases include small values of `n` (e.g., 1, 2, 3).

### Strategy

1. **Prime Factorization Function**: We need a helper function to calculate the sum of prime factors of `n`.
2. **Replacement Process**: We keep replacing `n` with the sum of its prime factors until the value no longer changes.
3. **Prime Checking and Factor Summation**:
   - Check for small factors (2 and 3).
   - Use a loop to check for factors up to the square root of `n`.
4. **Termination Condition**: The process terminates when `n` remains unchanged after a complete iteration of factor summation.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    
    public int smallestValue(int n) {
        while (true) {
            int sumOfFactors = sumPrimeFactors(n);
            if (sumOfFactors == n) {
                break;
            }
            n = sumOfFactors;
        }
        return n;
    }

    private int sumPrimeFactors(int n) {
        int sum = 0;

        // Check for number of 2s that divide n
        while (n % 2 == 0) {
            sum += 2;
            n /= 2;
        }

        // Check for number of 3s that divide n
        while (n % 3 == 0) {
            sum += 3;
            n /= 3;
        }

        // Check for other primes less than sqrt(n)
        for (int i = 5; i * i <= n; i += 6) {
            while (n % i == 0) {
                sum += i;
                n /= i;
            }
            while (n % (i + 2) == 0) {
                sum += (i + 2);
                n /= (i + 2);
            }
        }

        // This condition is to check if n is a prime number greater than 4
        if (n > 1) {
            sum += n;
        }

        return sum;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **sumPrimeFactors Function**: It efficiently calculates the sum of prime factors:
   - Handle the number 2 and 3 separately because they are the smallest primes.
   - Use a loop starting from 5, incremented by 6, to check for primes up to the square root of `n`.
   - This loop structure (i and i+2) skips even numbers and multiples of 3, providing checks for the next possible primes.

2. **smallestValue Function**: This function uses a loop to repeatedly replace `n` with the sum of its prime factors until the sum remains constant. 

### Time Complexity

- **Prime Factorization**: For a given number `n`, finding prime factors up to \(\sqrt{n}\) is \(O(\sqrt{n})\).
- **Replacement Process**: Each replacement reduces `n` and converges quickly because the sum of prime factors tends to be much smaller.
- **Overall Complexity**: The overall complexity is influenced by the number of iterations needed which can be approximated as \(O(\log n \cdot \sqrt{n})\) in the worst case. However, practical performance is usually much better due to fast convergence in each step.

This approach efficiently handles large values of `n` and ensures that the smallest value after replacements is found.
