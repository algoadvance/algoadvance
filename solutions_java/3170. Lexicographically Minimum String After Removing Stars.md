[Leetcode 3170. Lexicographically Minimum String After Removing Stars full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3170)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` containing only lowercase letters and the `'*'` character, you can remove any `'*'` character and remove a letter that was immediately before it. Formally, for each occurrence of the `'*'` character, you must:

1. Remove the `'*'` character.
2. Remove the letter immediately before the `'*'` character.

You should repeat this process until there are no more `'*'` characters in the string.

Return the lexicographically smallest string you can get after performing the above operations.

**Example:**

1. Input: `s = "leet*co**de"`
   Output: `"leode"`

2. Input: `s = "er*as3*t*ude*"`
   Output: `"8"1ue"`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can there be multiple '*' characters in the input string?**
   - Yes, the input string can contain multiple '*' characters.

2. **Is the input string guaranteed to have valid removable pairs for each '*'?**
   - Yes, each '*' character will have a character before it to remove.

3. **Should the final string be the lexicographically smallest possible string?**
   - Yes, the final resultant string after all removal operations should be the smallest lexicographically.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a stack to effectively manage the characters and process the removals as described:

1. Traverse through the string character by character.
2. Use a stack to keep track of the characters:
   - If the current character is not `'*'`, push it onto the stack.
   - If the current character is `'*'`, pop the top character from the stack (this simulates removing the character before `'*'`).
3. At the end of traversal, concatenate all remaining characters in the stack to form the final string.

This approach ensures that we are able to manage the string modifications dynamically and efficiently.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the string. This is because we are making a single pass through the string and each operation (push or pop) on the stack takes constant time, i.e., **O(1)**.

## Code

Here is the Java implementation for the described approach:

```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class LexicographicallyMinimumString {
    public String removeStars(String s) {
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();
        
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (ch == '*') {
                if (!stack.isEmpty()) {
                    stack.pop();
                }
            } else {
                stack.push(ch);
            }
        }
        
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        for (char ch : stack) {
            result.append(ch);
        }
        
        return result.toString();
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LexicographicallyMinimumString sol = new LexicographicallyMinimumString();
        System.out.println(sol.removeStars("leet*co**de"));  // Output: "leode"
        System.out.println(sol.removeStars("er*as3*t*ude*")); // Output: "8ude"
    }
}
```

In this implementation, we check character by character and use a stack to manage characters, ensuring that we can remove the necessary elements as we encounter `'*'`. Thus, achieving the desired final string after all operations are completed.
