[Leetcode 3161. Block Placement Queries](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3161)
## Problem Statement:
You are given an empty 2D binary grid of size `m x n`. The grid represents a planar map. You are also given an array of queries, where each query represents a point on the grid. For each query:
- If the cell is currently `0`, change it to `1`.
- For each cell that becomes a `1`, return the number of cells that are now connected. Two cells are connected if they are adjacent horizontally or vertically.

Write a function `int[] gridBlockPlacement(int m, int n, int[][] queries)` that returns an array of integers where each integer corresponds to the total number of connected cells after the corresponding operation described in queries is performed. Adjacency is defined as directly connected either horizontally or vertically.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Q**: What are the constraints on `m`, `n`, and the number of queries?
   **A**: Assume typical grid sizes are from `1 <= m, n <= 1000` and the number of queries is also up to `10^4`.
   
2. **Q**: Are diagonal connections considered?
   **A**: No, diagonal connections are not considered, only horizontal and vertical connections.

3. **Q**: Can we receive the same point multiple times in the queries?
   **A**: Yes, a cell can be mentioned multiple times in queries, but once it is set to `1`, it should remain as `1`.

4. **Q**: Should we count the number of cells that are `1` before the current query as connected, or just the current cell turned to `1` and its newly connected previous cells?
   **A**: We need to return the count of all newly connected cells including those that were previously `1`.

## Strategy:
1. We can use the Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) data structure to efficiently handle connectivity checks and unions.
2. For each query, if the cell at `grid[x][y]` is `0`, we set it to `1`, and then check its four neighbors (up, down, left, right). If a neighbor is also `1`, we union the sets of the current cell and the neighbor.
3. Use path compression in Union-Find to speed up the queries.
4. Track the sizes of connected components to quickly calculate the size of the connected component when cells are united.

## Code:
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int[] gridBlockPlacement(int m, int n, int[][] queries) {
        int[] result = new int[queries.length];
        int[][] grid = new int[m][n];
        UnionFind uf = new UnionFind(m * n);

        int[][] directions = // use example above
        int[] size = new int[m * n];
        
        // To track the current index in the result
        int index = 0;

        for (int[] query : queries) {
            int x = query[0];
            int y = query[1];
            
            if (grid[x][y] == 1) {
                result[index++] = size[uf.find(x * n + y)];
                continue;
            }

            grid[x][y] = 1;
            int currentIndex = x * n + y;
            size[currentIndex] = 1;

            for (int[] direction : directions) {
                int newX = x + direction[0];
                int newY = y + direction[1];

                if (isValid(newX, newY, m, n) && grid[newX][newY] == 1) {
                    int newIndex = newX * n + newY;
                    uf.union(currentIndex, newIndex);
                }
            }
            
            result[index++] = size[uf.find(currentIndex)];
        }

        return result;
    }

    private boolean isValid(int x, int y, int m, int n) {
        return x >= 0 && y >= 0 && x < m && y < n;
    }

    class UnionFind {
        int[] parent, rank;

        public UnionFind(int size) {
            parent = new int[size];
            rank = new int[size];
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                parent[i] = i;
                rank[i] = 1;
            }
        }

        public int find(int x) {
            if (x != parent[x]) {
                parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
            }
            return parent[x];
        }

        public void union(int x, int y) {
            int rootX = find(x);
            int rootY = find(y);

            if (rootX != rootY) {
                if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]) {
                    parent[rootY] = rootX;
                } else if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]) {
                    parent[rootX] = rootY;
                } else {
                    parent[rootY] = rootX;
                    rank[rootX]++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:
1. Each `find` and `union` operation in Union-Find with path compression and union by rank is nearly constant time, typically described as O(α(n)), where α is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows very slowly.
2. Each query involves at most 4 `union` operations, so the overall time complexity is approximately O(k * α(m * n)), where k is the number of queries.

Given the constraints, this approach should perform efficiently even for large inputs.
