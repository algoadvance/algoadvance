[Leetcode 1687. Delivering Boxes from Storage to Ports](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1687)
### Problem Statement

You have the task of delivering boxes from a storage unit to various ports. The ports are represented by a list of boxes, where each box has a weight and a destination port number. You have a truck that can carry a maximum weight `maxWeight` and a maximum number of boxes `maxBoxes` before it needs to be unloaded at a port. Unloading at a port costs you one trip. You need to find the minimum number of trips required to deliver all the boxes.

Here's a concrete representation:
- `boxes[i] = [port_i, weight_i]` denotes a box with destination port `port_i` and weight `weight_i`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range and constraints:**
   - What is the maximum number of boxes?
   - What is the maximum value of `maxWeight` and `maxBoxes`?

2. **Conditions and rules:**
   - Can the boxes be rearranged, or must they be delivered in the given order?
   - What happens if a box cannot be delivered because it exceeds both `maxWeight` and `maxBoxes`?

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Use two pointers to keep track of the current load, the weight, and box count.
   - Maintain a counter for number of trips.

2. **Delivery Mechanism:**
   - Iterate through the boxes and maintain the current total weight and count of boxes until either `maxWeight` or `maxBoxes` is exceeded.
   - If exceeded, deliver those boxes (increment the trip count), unload the truck, and start a new trip from that point.

3. **Handling Port Changes:**
   - Keep track of the port changes during delivery to ensure the trip count is correctly incremented for every new port.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int boxDelivering(int[][] boxes, int portsCount, int maxBoxes, int maxWeight) {
        int n = boxes.length;
        // dp[i] = minimum trips required to deliver boxes from 0 to i-1
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        // weight of the current load
        int currentWeight = 0;
        // number of boxes currently in the truck
        int currentBoxes = 0;
        
        // j is the left boundary of the window
        int j = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            currentWeight += boxes[i][1];
            currentBoxes++;
            
            // Ensure the truck doesn't exceed its limits
            while (currentWeight > maxWeight || currentBoxes > maxBoxes) {
                currentWeight -= boxes[j][1];
                currentBoxes--;
                j++;
            }
            
            // Calculate trips. When j is 0, it means it's the first trip.
            // otherwise, find the minimum trips required
            int trips = dp[j] + 1;
            if (i > 0 && boxes[i][0] != boxes[i - 1][0]) {
                trips++;
            }
            
            // compare to see if taking the current set of boxes results in fewer trips
            dp[i + 1] = Math.min(dp[i] + 2, trips);
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of boxes. The algorithm processes each box once in the window sliding mechanism which ensures linearity.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) due to the dp array used to store the minimum number of trips for each prefix of the boxes.

This approach optimizes the number of trips by dynamically recalculating the minimum trips needed and employing a sliding window that adjusts its bounds to ensure constraints are met.
