[Leetcode 2958. Length of Longest Subarray With at Most K Frequency](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2958)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the length of the longest subarray such that the frequency of each distinct element in this subarray is at most `k`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the range of values for the length of `nums`?
    - What is the range of values for the elements in `nums`?
    - What is the value range for `k`?

2. **Edge Cases**:
    - What should be returned if `nums` is empty?
    - What if `k` is 0?

3. **Output**:
    - Should the program return only the length of the subarray, or also the subarray itself?

For this explanation, let's assume:
- The length of `nums` can be up to `10^5`.
- The elements of `nums` can range within standard integer boundaries.
- `k` is a non-negative integer within the range `[0, 10^5]`.

## Strategy

We'll use the sliding window (two-pointer) technique to solve this problem efficiently.

### Steps:
1. Initialize two pointers, `start` and `end`, to represent the window's boundaries.
2. Use a hashmap to keep track of the frequency of elements within the current window.
3. Expand the window by moving the `end` pointer and updating the frequencies.
4. If any element's frequency exceeds `k`, increment the `start` pointer until the window satisfies the constraint again.
5. Track the maximum window size during the process.

### Time Complexity:
- Both pointers traverse the array once, leading to an `O(n)` time complexity where `n` is the length of `nums`.
- Hashmap operations (insert, update, delete) are on average `O(1)`.

## Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class LongestSubarray {
    public int longestSubarrayWithKFreq(int[] nums, int k) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();
        int maxLength = 0;
        int start = 0;

        for (int end = 0; end < nums.length; end++) {
            int endElement = nums[end];
            frequencyMap.put(endElement, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(endElement, 0) + 1);

            while (frequencyMap.get(endElement) > k) {
                int startElement = nums[start];
                frequencyMap.put(startElement, frequencyMap.get(startElement) - 1);

                if (frequencyMap.get(startElement) == 0) {
                    frequencyMap.remove(startElement);
                }

                start++;
            }

            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, end - start + 1);
        }

        return maxLength;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LongestSubarray solution = new LongestSubarray();
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 3, 3};
        int k = 2;
        System.out.println(solution.longestSubarrayWithKFreq(nums, k));  // Output should be 4
    }
}
```

This code initializes the window, iterates through the array, and adjusts the start pointer to maintain the constraint that no element's frequency exceeds `k`. The maximum window length is updated dynamically.
