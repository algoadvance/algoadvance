[Leetcode 1702. Maximum Binary String After Change](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1702)
### Problem Statement

You are given a binary string `binary` consisting only of `'0'`s and `'1'`s. You can perform the following operation any number of times on the string:

1. Pick any two adjacent bits and swap them.

The goal is to make the binary string as lexicographically large as possible. Return the lexicographically largest binary string that can be achieved after performing the above operation any number of times.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the length of `binary`?**
   - Yes, the length of `binary` is between 1 and \(10^5\).

2. **Should the solution prioritize performance considering the maximum length constraint?**
   - Yes, the solution should be efficient to handle the upper limit of the input size.

3. **Is it guaranteed that the input string will be non-empty?**
   - Yes, based on the constraints, the input string will always have at least one character.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, let's consider how we can manipulate leading '0's to make the string lexicographically larger.

1. **Move '1's to the left:** It's clear that the largest binary string will have all '1's on the left followed by '0's. However, through swapping, '1's can effectively move left.

2. **Count zeros and trailing ones:** 
    - Count the number of '0's (`numOfZeros`).
    - Count the number of '1's (`numOfOnes`).

3. **Form the largest binary string:**
    - The highest lexicographical order will have all '1's first, leaving the last `numOfZeros - 1` positions of the '0's intact.
    - If there are any '1's, then place a single '0' at the position where it will disrupt the '1's the least.

This can be achieved fairly simply by iteration and string manipulation.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public String maximumBinaryString(String binary) {
        int numOfZeros = 0;
        int numOfOnes = 0;

        // Count the number of '0's and '1's
        for (char c : binary.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '0') {
                numOfZeros++;
            } else {
                numOfOnes++;
            }
        }

        // If there are no '0's, or only one '0', the string is already the largest possible
        if (numOfZeros <= 1) {
            return binary;
        }

        // Most significant part of the string will be all '1's except for the last (numOfZeros - 1) part
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = 0; i < binary.length() - numOfZeros; i++) {
            result.append('1');
        }

        // Append (numOfZeros - 1) '0's followed by one '1'
        for (int i = 0; i < numOfZeros - 1; i++) {
            result.append('0');
        }

        // Place the remaining '1'
        result.append('1');

        return result.toString();
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Counting characters:** O(n) - We need to traverse the string once to count zeros and ones.
- **Building result string:** O(n) - We create a string of the same length by appending characters in a loop.

Overall, the time complexity is O(n), which is efficient given the constraint \( n \leq 10^5 \).

This solution provides a direct approach to achieving the lexicographically largest binary string by making use of counting and string construction to ensure optimal performance.
