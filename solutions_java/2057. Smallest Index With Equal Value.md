[Leetcode 2057. Smallest Index With Equal Value](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2057)
### Problem Statement:
Given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`, return the **smallest index** `i` of `nums` such that `i % 10 == nums[i]`. Return `-1` if no such index exists.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What are the constraints on the input array?**
   - Typically, for problems like this, the array length can be up to 10^5 and the elements can range from 0 to 10^9.
   
2. **Is there any specific requirement on the time complexity?**
   - While not explicitly stated, ideally, the solution should operate in linear time, O(n).

3. **Can the elements in the array be negative?**
   - Based on the problem description, it seems the elements are non-negative integers (although typically the constraints should be checked in the problem statement).

### Strategy:
1. **Iterate through the array:** 
   - Loop through each index `i` of the array.
   
2. **Check for the condition:**
   - For each index `i`, check if `i % 10 == nums[i]`.
   
3. **Return the index:** 
   - As soon as you find the first index that satisfies the condition, return that index.
   - If you complete the loop without finding any such index, return `-1`.

This approach checks each index exactly once, making it an O(n) solution, where n is the length of the array.

### Code:
```java
public class SmallestIndexWithEqualValue {
    public static int smallestEqual(int[] nums) {
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (i % 10 == nums[i]) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage:
        int[] nums1 = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
        int res1 = smallestEqual(nums1); // Should return 0

        int[] nums2 = {4, 3, 2, 1};
        int res2 = smallestEqual(nums2); // Should return 2

        int[] nums3 = {1, 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 1, 8, 9, 0};
        int res3 = smallestEqual(nums3); // Should return -1

        System.out.println(res1);
        System.out.println(res2);
        System.out.println(res3);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.
  - This is because we are iterating through each element of the array once.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - We are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This solution is efficient and follows a straightforward approach to solve the problem within the given constraints.
