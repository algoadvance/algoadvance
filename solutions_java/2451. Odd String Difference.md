[Leetcode 2451. Odd String Difference full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2451)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of strings `words`. Each string contains lower-case English letters of equal length. A string `s` is considered odd if and only if the difference between the ASCII values of every two consecutive characters is an odd value. Return the odd string from the array `words`. There will be exactly one string in the input list which meets the criteria.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size**:
   - What is the maximum length of each string in the `words` array?
   - What is the maximum number of strings in the `words` array?
   
2. **Output**:
   - Should the function return only one string that matches the criteria, assuming there's only one correct result?
   
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Should we consider edge cases such as empty strings or an empty input array, or is it guaranteed that the input will always be a non-empty array with non-empty strings?

Let's assume from the statement that there is always exactly one string that meets the condition.

### Strategy
1. **Iterate through the `words` array**:
    - For each string, compute the absolute difference between the ASCII values of every two consecutive characters.
    - Check if all these differences are odd.
    - If a string meets this condition, return this string.

### Code
Here is the implementation of the given problem in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public String oddString(String[] words) {
        for (String word : words) {
            boolean isOdd = true; // flag to check if all differences are odd
            for (int i = 0; i < word.length() - 1; i++) {
                int diff = Math.abs(word.charAt(i) - word.charAt(i + 1));
                if (diff % 2 == 0) {
                    isOdd = false; // found an even difference
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (isOdd) {
                return word; // return the odd string
            }
        }
        return ""; // Default case, should not be reached
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution can be analyzed as follows:
- Let `n` be the number of words in the `words` array.
- Let `m` be the length of each word.

The solution involves:
- Iterating through each word (`O(n)`).
- Checking the differences for each pair of consecutive characters in a word (`O(m)`).

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n * m)`.
