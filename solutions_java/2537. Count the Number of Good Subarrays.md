[Leetcode 2537. Count the Number of Good Subarrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2537)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the total number of subarrays that have exactly `k` distinct integers.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Does the order of elements in the subarray matter?**
   - Yes, we need to maintain the order as they appear in the original array.

2. **Can `nums` contain negative integers?**
   - Yes, `nums` can contain negative integers, zero, and positive integers.

3. **What are the size constraints of the array `nums` and the value of `k`?**
   - The length of `nums` can be up to 100,000 and `k` is a positive integer that can go up to the length of `nums`.

## Strategy

1. **Two Pointers with Sliding Window:** 
   - We use two pointers to maintain a window that contains exactly `k` distinct integers.
   - Maintain a frequency map that tells how many times an element appears in the current window.
   - Adjust the window size and keep a count of valid subarrays.

2. **Helper Function for At Most k Distinct Integers:**
   - We need a helper function that counts the number of subarrays with at most `k` distinct integers.
   - Using this function, compute the number of subarrays with exactly `k` distinct integers by computing:
     - `atMostK(k) - atMostK(k-1)`

## Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {

    public int subarraysWithKDistinct(int[] nums, int k) {
        return atMostK(nums, k) - atMostK(nums, k - 1);
    }

    private int atMostK(int[] nums, int k) {
        int left = 0, right = 0;
        int result = 0;
        
        Map<Integer, Integer> countMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        while (right < nums.length) {
            countMap.put(nums[right], countMap.getOrDefault(nums[right], 0) + 1);
            
            while (countMap.size() > k) {
                countMap.put(nums[left], countMap.get(nums[left]) - 1);
                if (countMap.get(nums[left]) == 0) {
                    countMap.remove(nums[left]);
                }
                left++;
            }
            
            result += right - left + 1;
            right++;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sliding Window Calculation:** Each element is processed at most twice (once when expanding the window and once when contracting), leading to a linear time complexity.
- **Overall Time Complexity:** The overall time complexity is O(n), where `n` is the length of the `nums` array.

This solution is efficient given the constraints, ensuring that it processes the array in linear time.
