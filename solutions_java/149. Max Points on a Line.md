[Leetcode 149. Max Points on a Line](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l149)
### Problem Statement

Given `n` points on a 2D plane, find the maximum number of points that lie on the same straight line.

**Example:**
```
Input: [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: 3
```

Additional details:
1. Points are represented as an array of arrays, where each sub-array contains two integers representing the x and y coordinates of a point.
2. If no points are given, the function should return 0.
3. All points are unique.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are there negative coordinates?
   - Yes, points can have negative coordinates.
2. What should be the output if there is only one point?
   - If there is only one point, the output should be 1.
3. Is there a limit on the number of points?
   - No specific limit mentioned, but usually n could be reasonably large.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we use the concept of calculating the slope between two points. Points that share the same slope with a given point lie on the same line passing through that point.

Steps:
1. Iterate through each point.
2. For each point, calculate the slope to every other point.
3. Use a hashmap to store the slopes and their counts.
4. The highest count for any given point is the number of points that can lie on a single line passing through that point.
5. Keep track of the maximum count across all iterations.

To avoid precision issues with floating-point arithmetic, we will represent slopes as a fraction of two integers (dx, dy) and normalize them by their greatest common divisor (GCD).

### Time Complexity

The nested iteration results in a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\), where 'n' is the number of points. This is due to iterating through each point and then iterating again to compute slopes with every other point.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public int maxPoints(int[][] points) {
        if (points.length == 0) return 0;
        if (points.length == 1) return 1;

        int maxPoints = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
            HashMap<String, Integer> slopeCount = new HashMap<>();
            int duplicate = 1;
            int maxForCurrent = 0;

            for (int j = 0; j < points.length; j++) {
                if (i == j) continue;

                int dx = points[j][0] - points[i][0];
                int dy = points[j][1] - points[i][1];
                
                if (dx == 0 && dy == 0) {
                    duplicate++;
                } else {
                    int gcd = gcd(dx, dy);
                    dx /= gcd;
                    dy /= gcd;
                    
                    String slope = dy + "/" + dx;
                    slopeCount.put(slope, slopeCount.getOrDefault(slope, 0) + 1);
                    maxForCurrent = Math.max(maxForCurrent, slopeCount.get(slope));
                }
            }
            
            maxPoints = Math.max(maxPoints, maxForCurrent + duplicate);
        }
        
        return maxPoints;
    }

    private int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) return a;
        return gcd(b, a % b);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[][] points1 = // use example from above
        System.out.println(sol.maxPoints(points1)); // Output: 3

        int[][] points2 = // use example from above
        System.out.println(sol.maxPoints(points2)); // Output: 4
    }
}
```

### Analysis

1. Iterate through each point, and for each point, calculate slopes relative to other points.
2. Use a HashMap to count occurrences of each slope.
3. Account for duplicates as points that are the same as the current reference point.
4. Return the maximum count observed.

This solution is efficient given the constraints and should work well within the typical input limits.
