[Leetcode 143. Reorder List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l143)
### Problem Statement

You are given the head of a singly linked list `head`, reorder the list to be on the following form:

```
L0 → Ln → L1 → Ln-1 → L2 → Ln-2 → …
```

You may not modify the values in the list's nodes. Only nodes themselves may be changed.

#### Example:

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,4,2,3]

Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,5,2,4,3]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Is the input list guaranteed to have at least one node?
   **A**: Yes, the input list is guaranteed to have at least one node.

2. **Q**: What should we return if the list has only one element?
   **A**: If the list has only one element, we do not need to make any changes. It should remain as is.

3. **Q**: What do we do if the list is empty?
   **A**: The problem guarantees at least one node, so this scenario does not need to be handled.

### Strategy

To reorder the list as described, we can follow these steps:

1. **Find the Middle**:
   Use the slow and fast pointer approach to find the middle of the linked list. This will help us to split the list into two halves.

2. **Reverse the Second Half**:
   Reverse the second half of the linked list. This can be done using a standard linked list reversal algorithm.

3. **Merge the Two Halves**:
   Merge the two halves by alternating nodes from each half. Specifically, take a node from the first half, then a node from the reversed second half, and repeat.

### Code

Here is the Java implementation of the given strategy:

```java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode() {}
    ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
    ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
}

public class Solution {
    public void reorderList(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) return;

        // Step 1: Find the middle of the linked list using fast and slow pointers
        ListNode slow = head, fast = head;
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }

        // Step 2: Reverse the second half of the linked list
        ListNode secondHalf = reverseList(slow.next);
        slow.next = null; // split the list into two halves

        // Step 3: Merge the two halves
        ListNode firstHalf = head;
        while (secondHalf != null) {
            ListNode temp1 = firstHalf.next;
            ListNode temp2 = secondHalf.next;

            firstHalf.next = secondHalf;
            secondHalf.next = temp1;

            firstHalf = temp1;
            secondHalf = temp2;
        }
    }

    private ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode prev = null, curr = head;
        while (curr != null) {
            ListNode nextNode = curr.next;
            curr.next = prev;
            prev = curr;
            curr = nextNode;
        }
        return prev;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Finding the Middle**: O(n) where `n` is the number of nodes in the list. We are traversing the list once.
- **Reversing the Second Half**: O(n/2) which simplifies to O(n). This involves traversing half of the list.
- **Merging the Two Halves**: O(n) as we are traversing through each node once.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.

The space complexity is **O(1)** since we are doing everything in place and not using any extra space apart from a few pointers.
