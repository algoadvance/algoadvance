[Leetcode 1451. Rearrange Words in a Sentence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1451)
## Problem Statement

You are given a sentence `text` (a string of space-separated words) where each word consists of lowercase and uppercase letters. Rearrange the words in the sentence such that the following conditions are true:
1. The first word in the sentence is capitalized.
2. Every word in the sentence that comes after the first word is lowercase.
3. Words are ordered by their lengths in ascending order. If two words have the same length, they should retain their original relative order.

Return the formatted sentence as a string.

## Clarifying Questions
1. How should we handle punctuation marks or special characters within the words?
   - For simplicity, we assume there are no punctuation marks or special characters within the words.
   
2. Is it guaranteed that the input string will contain at least one word?
   - Yes, the input string will always contain at least one word.

3. Are there any constraints on the size of the input text?
   - `text` is a string with a length between 1 and $10^5$.

## Strategy

1. **Split the Sentence**: Split the input sentence into individual words.
2. **Sort Words**: Sort these words by their lengths. In case of a tie (words of the same length), maintain their original order since the sorted method of Python is stable.
3. **Reconstruct the Sentence**:
   - Capitalize the first word.
   - Lowercase all the remaining words.
4. **Join**: Join these words back into a single string with spaces separating them.
5. **Return**: Return the final rearranged sentence.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class RearrangeWords {

    public static String arrangeWords(String text) {
        // Convert the initial letter to lowercase
        text = text.substring(0, 1).toLowerCase() + text.substring(1);
        
        // Split the text into words
        String[] words = text.split(" ");
        
        // Sort words based on their lengths
        Arrays.sort(words, (a, b) -> a.length() - b.length());
        
        // Combine words back into a sentence
        String result = String.join(" ", words);
        
        // Capitalize the first character of the result and form the final sentence
        result = result.substring(0, 1).toUpperCase() + result.substring(1);
        
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String text = "Leetcode is cool";
        System.out.println(arrangeWords(text)); // Output: "Is cool leetcode"
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Splitting the String**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input string `text`.
- **Sorting the Words**: Assuming `m` is the number of words, sorting requires `O(m * log m)` time.
- **Joining the Words**: `O(n)` time to join the words back into a single string.

The overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, thus it is `O(m * log m)` where `m` is the number of words.
