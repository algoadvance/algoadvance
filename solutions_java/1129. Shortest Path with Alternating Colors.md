[Leetcode 1129. Shortest Path with Alternating Colors](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1129)
## Problem Statement

You are given an undirected graph of n nodes, where each node is labeled from 0 to n-1. You are also given, two arrays of edges: `redEdges` and `blueEdges`, representing the edges in the graph that are colored red and blue, respectively. The edges arrays have poses of the form (u, v) where u is connected to v.

Return an array `answer` of length n, where `answer[i]` is the length of the shortest path from node 0 to node i such that the edges used to get from 0 to i alternate in colors. If it is not possible, return -1 for that node.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the possible ranges for `n`, `redEdges`, and `blueEdges`?
   - Are self-loops and multiple edges between the same pair of nodes allowed in the graph? 

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What if either `redEdges` or `blueEdges` is empty?
   - What if `n` is 1?
   - What if a node is completely disconnected?

## Strategy
1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Use two adjacency lists to represent the graph, one for red edges and one for blue edges.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - Perform a BFS starting at node 0 but alternate between red and blue edges.
   - Maintain two distances arrays to track the shortest path for each color.
   - Use a queue to process nodes, storing tuples of the current node, current distance, and the last edge color used.

3. **Handling Unreachable Nodes:**
   - After the BFS completes, if a node hasn't been reached by either red or blue edges, it is marked with -1.

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n + E)`, where `E` is the number of edges. This is because each node and edge is processed a limited number of times.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n + E)`, for adjacency lists and additional storage for BFS structures.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int[] shortestAlternatingPaths(int n, int[][] redEdges, int[][] blueEdges) {
        List<Integer>[] redAdj = new List[n];
        List<Integer>[] blueAdj = new List[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            redAdj[i] = new ArrayList<>();
            blueAdj[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        
        for (int[] edge : redEdges) {
            redAdj[edge[0]].add(edge[1]);
        }
        
        for (int[] edge : blueEdges) {
            blueAdj[edge[0]].add(edge[1]);
        }
        
        int[] redDist = new int[n];
        int[] blueDist = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(redDist, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        Arrays.fill(blueDist, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        redDist[0] = 0;
        blueDist[0] = 0;
        
        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(new int[]{0, 0, -1}); // (node, distance, lastColor)
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] current = queue.poll();
            int node = current[0];
            int distance = current[1];
            int lastColor = current[2];
            
            if (lastColor != 0) {
                for (int neighbor : redAdj[node]) {
                    if (distance + 1 < redDist[neighbor]) {
                        redDist[neighbor] = distance + 1;
                        queue.offer(new int[]{neighbor, distance + 1, 0});
                    }
                }
            }
            
            if (lastColor != 1) {
                for (int neighbor : blueAdj[node]) {
                    if (distance + 1 < blueDist[neighbor]) {
                        blueDist[neighbor] = distance + 1;
                        queue.offer(new int[]{neighbor, distance + 1, 1});
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        int[] answer = new int[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (redDist[i] == Integer.MAX_VALUE && blueDist[i] == Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
                answer[i] = -1;
            } else {
                answer[i] = Math.min(redDist[i], blueDist[i]);
            }
        }
        
        return answer;
    }
}
```

Make sure you understand the problem constraints and edge cases before proceeding with the implementation. This approach ensures every possibility of alternating paths is considered efficiently using BFS while maintaining clarity and conciseness.
