[Leetcode 2711. Difference of Number of Distinct Values on Diagonals](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2711)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed 2D `matrix` of size `m` x `n`, which consists of positive integers. The `matrix` represents a grid of cells.

The diagonal elements of a grid are the elements that can be accessed by moving 45 degrees to the left or right, starting from a particular element. An element is part of the main diagonal if it is accessed by a 45-degree move to the left starting from the element itself (moving from top left to bottom right). 

For each element in the matrix, you need to:
1. Identify all the elements on the same diagonal in the top-left direction and the bottom-right direction from that element.
2. Calculate the numbers of distinct integers in both directions.
3. Compute the absolute difference between these two values.

Given the above, write a function `differenceOfDistinctDiagonalValues(matrix)` which returns a new matrix of the same size wherein each element is replaced by the absolute difference of the number of distinct integers in its top-left and bottom-right diagonals.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: What are the constraints on the matrix dimensions and the range of the integer values?
   - Assume `m, n <= 100` and integer values are positive.

2. **Diagonal Definition**: Clarifying if diagonals include the element itself?
   - Yes, the diagonals include the element itself.

3. **Output Format**: How should the result be returned?
   - Return a matrix of the same size with each element replaced as described.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. Iterate over each element of the matrix.
2. For each element, determine the distinct values on its top-left diagonal by traversing up and to the left.
3. Similarly, determine the distinct values on its bottom-right diagonal by traversing down and to the right.
4. Calculate the absolute difference between the number of distinct values in these two diagonals.
5. Create a new matrix to store these absolute differences and return it.

### Code

Here's the Java code to implement this solution:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class Solution {
    public int[][] differenceOfDistinctDiagonalValues(int[][] matrix) {
        int m = matrix.length;
        int n = matrix[0].length;
        int[][] result = new int[m][n];

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                Set<Integer> topLeftDiagonal = new HashSet<>();
                Set<Integer> bottomRightDiagonal = new HashSet<>();

                // Calculate top-left diagonal distinct values
                int row = i, col = j;
                while (row >= 0 && col >= 0) {
                    topLeftDiagonal.add(matrix[row][col]);
                    row--;
                    col--;
                }

                // Calculate bottom-right diagonal distinct values
                row = i;
                col = j;
                while (row < m && col < n) {
                    bottomRightDiagonal.add(matrix[row][col]);
                    row++;
                    col++;
                }

                // Absolute difference of distinct values count
                result[i][j] = Math.abs(topLeftDiagonal.size() - bottomRightDiagonal.size());
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Each element requires traversing its top-left and bottom-right diagonals.
- The maximum length for any diagonal is the minimum of the matrix's dimensions, which is `O(m + n)`.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(m * n * (m + n))` where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.

This complexity is feasible given the constraints provided.
