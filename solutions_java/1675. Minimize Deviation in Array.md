[Leetcode 1675. Minimize Deviation in Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1675)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` of `n` positive integers. The deviation of the array is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array.

You can perform two types of operations any number of times on any element of the array:

1. If the element is even, you can divide it by 2 (you may perform this operation several times).
2. If the element is odd, you can multiply it by 2 (you can perform this operation only once).

The goal is to minimize the deviation of the array.

Return the minimum deviation.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints:**
   - What are the constraints on the size of the array `nums`?
   - What are the constraints on the values within the array `nums`?

2. **Input Validity:**
   - Can the input array `nums` be empty?
   - Are all elements guaranteed to be positive integers?

**Given Constraints:**
- `n == nums.length`
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

### Strategy

1. **Initial Transformation:**
   - Convert all odd numbers to even by multiplying them by 2. This is because we cannot divide odd numbers but can multiply them once to make them even which will give flexibility for further operations.

2. **Use a Max-Heap:**
   - To easily track the maximum element in the array, use a max-heap. Implement this using Java's `PriorityQueue` with custom comparator for implementing max-heap.

3. **Operations Simulation:**
   - Continuously extract the maximum element from the heap and reduce it by half (since it's even).
   - Push the reduced element back to the heap.
   - Keep track of the minimum value seen so far.
   - Update the deviation value each time an operation is performed.
   - If the extracted maximum is odd, stop the process because odd numbers cannot be reduced further.

4. **End Condition:**
   - The process will end either when the heap only contains odd numbers or no more operations can further reduce the deviation.

### Code

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;
import java.util.Collections;

public class MinimizeDeviation {
    public int minimumDeviation(int[] nums) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        int minValue = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        // Convert all numbers to even and find the initial min value
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num % 2 == 1) {
                num *= 2;
            }
            maxHeap.add(num);
            minValue = Math.min(minValue, num);
        }

        int minDeviation = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        while (true) {
            int maxValue = maxHeap.poll();
            minDeviation = Math.min(minDeviation, maxValue - minValue);

            if (maxValue % 2 == 1) {
                break;
            }

            maxValue /= 2;
            minValue = Math.min(minValue, maxValue);
            maxHeap.add(maxValue);
        }

        return minDeviation;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimizeDeviation md = new MinimizeDeviation();
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        System.out.println(md.minimumDeviation(nums));  // Output example: 1
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is primarily determined by the number of operations performed and the heap operations.
- **Heap Operations:** Each insertion and deletion operation for the heap take \(O(\log n)\) time.
- **Worst Case:** Each element may be halved up to \(\log (\text{max} \_  nums[i])\) times.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log (\text{max} \_  nums[i]) \log n)\).

This solution efficiently reduces the deviation and adheres to the constraints provided.
