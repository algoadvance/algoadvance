[Leetcode 3187. Peaks in Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3187)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of integers. A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors. Find the indices of all the peak elements in the array. You may assume that the array length is at least 1. 

For an array element `a[i]` to be a peak:
- If `i = 0`, it is a peak if `a[i] > a[i + 1]`
- If `i = n - 1`, it is a peak if `a[i] > a[i - 1]`
- For all other indices, `a[i]` is a peak if `a[i] > a[i - 1]` and `a[i] > a[i + 1]`

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [1, 3, 2, 7, 5, 6, 4]
Output: [1, 3, 5]
```
  
### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the array contain duplicate elements?
   **A:** Yes, but duplicate elements should not affect the finding of peak elements since a peak element must be strictly greater than its neighbors.

2. **Q:** What is the expected output if there are no peaks in the array?
   **A:** We should return an empty list.

3. **Q:** Are we allowed to use extra space?
   **A:** Yes, you can use additional space proportional to the size of the input array to store the indices of peak elements.

### Strategy
1. **Iterate through the array** and check each element to determine if it is a peak based on the given conditions.
2. To decide if an element at index `i` is a peak, consider:
   - The element at the start of the array (i = 0)
   - The element at the end of the array (i = n - 1)
   - Elements in the middle of the array (0 < i < n - 1)

### Code
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class PeaksInArray {
    public List<Integer> findPeakElements(int[] nums) {
        List<Integer> peaks = new ArrayList<>();
        int n = nums.length;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((i == 0 || nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) && (i == n - 1 || nums[i] > nums[i + 1])) {
                peaks.add(i);
            }
        }
        
        return peaks;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PeaksInArray solution = new PeaksInArray();

        int[] nums = {1, 3, 2, 7, 5, 6, 4};
        System.out.println(solution.findPeakElements(nums));  // Output: [1, 3, 5]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is \(O(n)\) because we are iterating through the array exactly once to evaluate each element.
- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) for the algorithm itself, but the output list will require \(O(k)\) additional space, where \(k\) is the number of peak elements.
