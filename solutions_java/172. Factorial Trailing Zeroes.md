[Leetcode 172. Factorial Trailing Zeroes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l172)
## Problem Statement

**172. Factorial Trailing Zeroes**

Given an integer `n`, return the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` (n factorial).

Note: Your solution should be in logarithmic time complexity.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What is the range of the input `n`?
   **A:** The input `n` is a non-negative integer which can be as large as up to \(10^9\).

2. **Q:** Do we need to actually compute the factorial of `n`?
   **A:** No, we only need to count the number of trailing zeroes in `n!`.

3. **Q:** What constitutes a "trailing zero"?
   **A:** Trailing zeros are the number of consecutive `0` digits at the end of the number.

## Strategy

### Key Insight

A trailing zero is produced by a factor of 10 in the number. Since 10 is the product of 2 and 5, each pair of these factors in the factorial contributes to a trailing zero. In any factorial, there are more factors of 2 than factors of 5, so the number of trailing zeros is determined by the number of factors of 5.

### Steps to Solve

1. **Count factors of 5:** 
    - First, count how many multiples of 5 are there in numbers from 1 to `n`.
    - Second, count how many multiples of \(5^2 = 25\) are there, as each of these contributes an extra factor of 5.
    - Continue this process for \(5^3\), \(5^4\), etc., until \(5^k\) where \(5^k > n\).

### Code Implementation

```java
public class Solution {
    public int trailingZeroes(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n >= 5) {
            n /= 5;  // Integer division to count multiples of 5, 25, 125, etc.
            count += n;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(log5(n))
  - This is because the number of iterations needed is proportional to the number of times you can divide `n` by 5 before it becomes less than 5.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - The space requirement is constant, as only a couple of integer variables are used regardless of the input size.

This solution efficiently counts the number of trailing zeros in `n!` without having to compute the factorial itself, making it suitable for very large values of `n` as required.
