[Leetcode 2550. Count Collisions of Monkeys on a Polygon](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2550)
### Problem Statement
2550. Count Collisions of Monkeys on a Polygon

There's a regular `n`-sided polygon that monkeys, each starting at one vertex, are walking around. Each monkey moves simultaneously to an adjacent vertex, either clockwise or counterclockwise, with equal probability. You need to count how many distinct ways the monkeys can occupy the vertices of the polygon after exactly one move, such that no two monkeys end up on the same vertex.

You need to return the total number of distinct ways modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Does `n` have an upper limit?
   - Yes, typically problems on LeetCode will have reasonable upper bounds. Let's assume \( n \leq 10^5 \).
2. Can we assume all monkeys will always make exactly one move between the vertices after which we count the distinct configurations?
   - Yes. 
3. Does the polygon regularity imply uniform distance between vertices?
   - Yes, and this symmetry is essential for solving the problem.

### Strategy
Each monkey has two choices: moving to the adjacent vertex in either direction. For `n` vertices, there are \( 2^n \) possible moves as each monkey independently chooses one of two directions. However, permutations leading to the same vertex occupancy should be carefully counted.

**Critical Observations:**
1. **Factorial Component**: To avoid collisions, each monkey will end up in one of `n!` permutations of the vertices.
2. **Modulo Operations**: Given the large output potential, use \( 10^9 + 7 \).

**Steps**:
1. Calculate \( 2^n \mod (10^9 + 7) \) for the total number of arrangements monkeys can have.
2. Subtract the number of configurations where at least one collision occurs. Given distinct nature in goal, this step isn’t necessary if we assume all \( 2^n \) configurations allow unique placements.

However, for correctness:
- **Burnside's Lemma** may refine our collision awareness via combinatorics but here:
- For large configurations, asymptotic containment means direct factorial derivative \( O(n) \) remains core unless symmetrical block constraints apply.

**Code Implementation**:
```java
import java.math.BigInteger;

public class CountCollisions {
    public static int countCollisions(int n) {
        int MOD = 1_000_000_007;

        // Calculating power 2^n % MOD
        long totalWays = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            totalWays = (totalWays * 2) % MOD;
        }

        // Calculating inverse of n! % MOD
        long factorial = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            factorial = (factorial * i) % MOD;
        }

        // Fermat's little theorem: a^(p-1) ≡ 1 (mod p) 
        // → a^(p-2) ≡ a^(-1) (mod p)
        long factorialInverse = BigInteger.valueOf(factorial).modInverse(BigInteger.valueOf(MOD)).longValue();

        // Result: (totalWays * factorialInverse) % MOD
        long result = (totalWays * factorialInverse) % MOD;

        return (int) result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 5; // example
        System.out.println(countCollisions(n));  // Output will depend on value of n
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Computing \( 2^n \mod (10^9+7) \) requires O(n) via iterative multiplications.
- Calculating factorial and its modular inverse via Fermat’s theorem remains O(n).

Total: **O(n)**
This is efficient given constraints.
