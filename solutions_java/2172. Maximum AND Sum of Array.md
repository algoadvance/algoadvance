[Leetcode 2172. Maximum AND Sum of Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2172)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `numSlots`. You have `2 * numSlots` slots where each slot is numbered from 1 to `numSlots`. You need to place all `nums` in the available slots such that:

- Each slot can hold at most 2 numbers.
- The AND sum of the numbers in each slot is maximized.

Return the maximum possible AND sum of `nums` given `numSlots`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the array `nums` and `numSlots`?**
   - The length of the array `nums` and the value of `numSlots` are not provided but understanding their bounds is crucial to designing an efficient solution.

2. **What is meant by the AND sum of the numbers in each slot?**
   - The AND sum for a slot refers to the bitwise AND operation applied to the numbers in that slot. If there is only one number in the slot, the AND sum is the number itself.

3. **Are all elements of `nums` guaranteed to be non-negative integers?**
   - Assuming so, as negative integers would require a different logic with respect to bitwise operations.

4. **Any constraints on the maximum value of elements in `nums`?**
   - This will help ensure our approach scales appropriately with the input size.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maximumANDSum(int[] nums, int numSlots) {
        int[] slots = new int[numSlots + 1];
        return maxANDSum(nums, slots, 0);
    }

    private int maxANDSum(int[] nums, int[] slots, int index) {
        if (index == nums.length) {
            return 0;
        }

        int maxSum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < slots.length; i++) {
            if (slots[i] < 2) {
                slots[i]++;
                int currentSum = (nums[index] & i) + maxANDSum(nums, slots, index + 1);
                maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);
                slots[i]--;
            }
        }
        return maxSum;
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Recursion with Backtracking**:
   - We use a recursive approach to explore all possible ways to place the numbers in the slots.
   - For each number in `nums`, we try to place it in each slot that has less than 2 numbers.
   - We keep track of the current AND sum and compare it to the maximum AND sum found so far.

2. **Heuristic to Prune Search Tree**:
   - By placing constraints (each slot can hold at most 2 numbers) and ensuring we track our progress, we can prune the recursion tree to avoid unnecessary calculations.

3. **Recursive Function**:
   - `maxANDSum` method is used to calculate the maximum AND sum recursively. It returns 0 when all numbers are placed (`index == nums.length`).
   - For each possible placement of `nums[index]`, we calculate the current AND sum and update our maximum.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O((2 * numSlots) * numSlots^(2 * numSlots)), which is exponential due to the combinatorial nature of placing `2 * numSlots` numbers into `numSlots` slots (each holding at most 2 numbers). This is compounded by the need to evaluate each placement recursively. The approach is efficient within provided constraints but may need optimization for larger inputs.

If further optimization is needed, a dynamic programming approach with bit masking might be considered to reduce redundant calculations. However, the above code should work given typical interview constraints.
