[Leetcode 2800. Shortest String That Contains Three Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2800)
### Problem Statement

Given three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, your task is to find the shortest string that contains all three strings as substrings. If there are multiple results, you may return any one of them.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Overlapping Substrings**: Should we consider overlapping substrings? For example, if `a = "abc"`, `b = "bcd"`, and `c = "cde"`, can the output be "abcde" considering overlaps?
    - **Answer**: Yes, overlapping substrings should be considered to minimize the string length.

2. **Case Sensitivity**: Are we considering case-sensitive matches?
   - **Answer**: Yes, strings are case-sensitive.
   
3. **Order of Substrings**: Is there a specific order in which the strings must appear?
   - **Answer**: No, there is no specific order. The goal is just to ensure all three strings are contained.

4. **Input Constraints**: What are the constraints on the lengths of the strings?
   - **Answer**: The problem typically won't specify, but we'll assume they can be relatively short since direct combinatorial checks won't be efficient with very long strings.

### Strategy

1. **Combine and Overlap**: We need to find all possible ways to combine and overlap the given three strings. 

2. **Use Helper Function for Overlap**: We'll create a helper function to determine the shortest string formed by overlapping two strings.

3. **Permutations**: We will consider all permutations (6 permutations) of the strings to ensure we find the shortest combination.

4. **Compare Lengths**: Among the combinations obtained, we will return the one with the minimum length.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class ShortestStringContainingThree {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(findShortestContaining("abc", "bcd", "cde"));
    }

    public static String findShortestContaining(String a, String b, String c) {
        // List of permutations of a, b, c
        String[][] permutations = {
                {a, b, c},
                {a, c, b},
                {b, a, c},
                {b, c, a},
                {c, a, b},
                {c, b, a}
        };

        String shortest = null;

        // Check combinations of all permutations
        for (String[] perm : permutations) {
            String combined = mergeStrings(mergeStrings(perm[0], perm[1]), perm[2]);
            if (shortest == null || combined.length() < shortest.length()) {
                shortest = combined;
            }
        }
        return shortest;
    }

    private static String mergeStrings(String a, String b) {
        int maxOverlap = 0;

        // Find the maximum overlap where b can overlap at the end of a
        for (int i = 1; i <= Math.min(a.length(), b.length()); i++) {
            if (a.endsWith(b.substring(0, i))) {
                maxOverlap = i;
            }
        }

        // Return the combined string
        return a + b.substring(maxOverlap);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

Given the combinatorial approach and that there are 6 permutations to consider:

- Let N be the maximum length of any of the three strings.
- Combining two strings takes O(N) to determine the maximum overlap.
- Each combination involves merging two pairs: hence O(6 * 2 * N) = O(N).

Overall, the time complexity is linear with respect to the length of the strings, i.e., **O(N)**. This assumes that operations like `endsWith` and `substring` are linear.
