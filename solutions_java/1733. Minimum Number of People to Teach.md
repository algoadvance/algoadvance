[Leetcode 1733. Minimum Number of People to Teach](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1733)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n`, indicating the number of languages. You are also given a list of lists `languages` where `languages[i]` is a list of the languages the ith person knows, and a 2D list `friendships` where `friendships[i] = [u_i, v_i]` denotes that the `u_i`-th person and the `v_i`-th person are friends.

A person `x` can only communicate with person `y` if and only if they know at least one common language. We want to choose a language and teach it to some people so that every pair of friends can communicate with each other. 

Return the minimum number of people to teach to achieve the goal.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - Is there a maximum number of friends or languages?
    - Can the `friendships` list have duplicate pairs?
    - Are the languages always represented by integers from 1 to `n`?

2. **Output:**
    - What should the output be if all friends can already communicate (i.e., no need to teach anyone)?

### Code

Let's start with the implementation of the solution:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int minimumTeachings(int n, int[][] languages, int[][] friendships) {
        Set<Integer>[] peopleLanguages = new Set[languages.length + 1];
        for (int i = 1; i <= languages.length; i++) {
            peopleLanguages[i] = new HashSet<>();
            for (int lang : languages[i - 1]) {
                peopleLanguages[i].add(lang);
            }
        }

        Set<Integer> candidates = new HashSet<>();
        for (int[] friendship : friendships) {
            int u = friendship[0];
            int v = friendship[1];
            boolean canCommunicate = false;
            for (int lang : peopleLanguages[u]) {
                if (peopleLanguages[v].contains(lang)) {
                    canCommunicate = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!canCommunicate) {
                candidates.add(u);
                candidates.add(v);
            }
        }

        if (candidates.isEmpty()) {
            return 0;
        }

        int minTeach = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int lang = 1; lang <= n; lang++) {
            int teachCount = 0;
            for (int person : candidates) {
                if (!peopleLanguages[person].contains(lang)) {
                    teachCount++;
                }
            }
            minTeach = Math.min(minTeach, teachCount);
        }
        
        return minTeach;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int n = 2;
        int[][] languages = // use example above
        int[][] friendships = // use example above
        System.out.println(solution.minimumTeachings(n, languages, friendships));  // Output: 1
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Data Preparation:**
   - Convert the `languages` list to a set representation for each person for quicker lookups.
   
2. **Identify Uncommunicative Friendships:**
   - Iterate through each friendship pair and check if they have common languages.
   - If not, add both people to a set of candidates, indicating these people need to learn a new language.
   
3. **Count Minimum People To Teach:**
   - Iterate through each possible language and count the number of candidates who do not know this language.
   - Track the minimum number of people to teach across all languages.

### Time Complexity

1. **Data Preparation:** O(P * L) where P is the number of people and L is the average number of languages per person.
2. **Identify Uncommunicative Friendships:** O(E * L) where E is the number of friendships and L is the average number of languages per person.
3. **Count Minimum People To Teach:** O(C * n) where C is the number of candidate people and n is the number of languages.

Overall, the time complexity is O(P * L + E * L + C * n), which should be efficient given typical constraints.
