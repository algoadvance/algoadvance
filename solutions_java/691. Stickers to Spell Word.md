[Leetcode 691. Stickers to Spell Word](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l691)
### Problem Statement
Given a list of `stickers` (each sticker is a string) and a `target` string, you need to find the minimum number of stickers required to spell the `target`. If it's not possible to spell the word using the stickers, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Does the order of characters in the target matter?**
   - No, the order of characters does not matter as long as we can form the target string using the stickers.

2. **Are there any constraints on the length of the `stickers` or `target`?**
   - The length of the `stickers` array is between 1 and 50.
   - The length of each sticker and the `target` is between 1 and 15.
   - All strings consist of lowercase English letters.

3. **Are stickers reusable?**
   - Yes, each sticker can be used any number of times.

### Strategy 
1. **Use a Frequency Count:**
   - For each sticker, create a frequency count of characters.

2. **Dynamic Programming with Memorization:**
   - Use a memorization technique to store the minimum number of stickers required to form a portion of the target.
   - Define a helper function that, given the current state of the target, returns the minimum stickers required.

3. **Recursive Solution:**
   - If the target is already formed, return 0.
   - For each sticker, try to decrement the count of characters in the target and recursively call for the remaining target. Track the minimum stickers required.

### Code

Here's the Java code:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    public int minStickers(String[] stickers, String target) {
        int n = stickers.length;
        // Convert stickers to count array
        int[][] stickerCount = new int[n][26];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (char c : stickers[i].toCharArray()) {
                stickerCount[i][c - 'a']++;
            }
        }
        
        Map<String, Integer> memo = new HashMap<>();
        memo.put("", 0);
        return helper(stickerCount, target, memo);
    }

    private int helper(int[][] stickerCount, String target, Map<String, Integer> memo) {
        if (memo.containsKey(target)) {
            return memo.get(target);
        }

        int[] targetCount = new int[26];
        for (char c : target.toCharArray()) {
            targetCount[c - 'a']++;
        }

        int result = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int[] sticker : stickerCount) {
            // If the current sticker contains the first character of target
            if (sticker[target.charAt(0) - 'a'] == 0) {
                continue;
            }
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                if (targetCount[i] > 0) {
                    for (int j = 0; j < Math.max(0, targetCount[i] - sticker[i]); j++) {
                        sb.append((char) (i + 'a'));
                    }
                }
            }
            String newTarget = sb.toString();
            int stickersNeeded = helper(stickerCount, newTarget, memo);
            if (stickersNeeded != -1) {
                result = Math.min(result, stickersNeeded + 1);
            }
        }

        memo.put(target, result == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : result);
        return memo.get(target);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        String[] stickers = {"with", "example", "science"};
        String target = "thehat";
        System.out.println(sol.minStickers(stickers, target)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity can be complex due to the exponential nature of the problem:
- **Sticker Count Calculation:** \(O(n \times l)\) where \(n\) is the number of stickers and \(l\) is the average length of the stickers.
- **Recursive Calls and Memoization:** The number of recursive calls can be up to \(2^t\) where \(t\) is the length of the target due to the power set combinations of characters in the target, but memoization will drastically reduce this.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is \(O(n \times l + m)\) where:
  - \(n\) is the number of stickers.
  - \(l\) is the length of each sticker.
  - \(m\) is the number of unique states saved in memoization.

The algorithm uses memoization to prevent redundant calculations and optimize the recursive calls.
