[Leetcode 2508. Add Edges to Make Degrees of All Nodes Even](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2508)
### Problem Statement

You are given an undirected graph with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n` and `m` edges between them. You need to determine the minimum number of edges you need to add to make the degrees of all nodes even. 

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What are the constraints on the number of nodes `n` and edges `m`?
    - Can `n` be as small as 1?
    - Are the nodes and edges always connected, or can the graph be disconnected?

2. **Output:**
    - If it is impossible to make all node degrees even, should we return `-1` or some other specific value?

3. **Edge Cases:**
    - If an edge already exists between two nodes, can we add another edge between the same nodes?
    - What if the graph is already such that all node degrees are even?

### Strategy

1. **Degree Counting:**
    - First, count the number of nodes that have odd degrees. Let's call this number `odd_count`.

2. **Basic Conditions:**
    - If `odd_count` is already 0, then no additional edges are needed.
    - If `odd_count` is odd, it's impossible to make all degrees even by adding edges since each edge affects 2 nodes (either making both even or both odd).

3. **Handling Cases:**
    - If `odd_count == 0`, return `0`.
    - If `odd_count` is greater than 0 and even, we need to see if it's possible to connect these odd-degree nodes using some additional edges.

### Code

Hereâ€™s how you can implement this in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MakeDegreesEven {
    public int addEdgesToMakeDegreesEven(int n, int[][] edges) {
        int[] degree = new int[n + 1];
        
        // Count degrees
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            degree[edge[0]]++;
            degree[edge[1]]++;
        }
        
        // Collect nodes with odd degrees
        List<Integer> oddNodes = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (degree[i] % 2 == 1) {
                oddNodes.add(i);
            }
        }
        
        int oddCount = oddNodes.size();
        
        if (oddCount == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (oddCount % 2 == 1) {
            return -1; // Impossible to make an odd number of nodes even
        }
        
        // Example handling: return the minimum number of edges required when `oddCount` is even
        // This part can get complex and requires validation checks, making sure each step either adds valid edges or identifies an impossible state
        
        if (oddCount == 2) {
            return 1; // One edge is enough
        }
        if (oddCount == 4) {
            // Check pairs (u,v) for oddNodes[u], oddNodes[v] if already not connected
            for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
                for (int j = i + 1; j < 4; j++) {
                    int nodeA = oddNodes.get(i);
                    int nodeB = oddNodes.get(j);
                    if (!areConnected(nodeA, nodeB, edges)) {
                        return 2;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return -1; // If none of the above strategies worked, we cannot make all degrees even
    }
    
    private boolean areConnected(int u, int v, int[][] edges) {
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            if ((edge[0] == u && edge[1] == v) || (edge[0] == v && edge[1] == u)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MakeDegreesEven solver = new MakeDegreesEven();
        int[][] edges = { {1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4} };
        int n = 4;
        System.out.println(solver.addEdgesToMakeDegreesEven(n, edges)); // Output: 1 (Example)
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Degree Counting:** \(O(m)\), where `m` is the number of edges.
- **Identifying odd degree nodes:** \(O(n)\).
- **Checking connectivity (pairwise):** \(O(n^2)\) in the worst case for validating all possible pairs.

Overall, the solution should be efficient enough for reasonable input sizes specified in standard LeetCode problems.
