[Leetcode 952. Largest Component Size by Common Factor](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l952)
## Problem Statement

Given a non-empty array of unique positive integers `A`, consider the following graph:

- There are `A.length` nodes, labelled `A[0]` to `A[A.length - 1]`;
- There is an edge between `A[i]` and `A[j]` if and only if `A[i]` and `A[j]` share a common factor greater than 1.

Return the size of the largest connected component in the graph.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints:**
   - What is the range of values for the integers in array `A`?
     - The integers will be in the range `[1, 100000]`.

2. **Size of the Array:**
   - What is the maximum size of the array `A`?
     - The maximum size of the array `A` can be up to `20000`.

3. **Common Factors:**
   - Should I assume the array only contains positive integers?
     - Yes, the array will contain unique positive integers greater than `0`.

4. **Edge Conditions:**
   - What should I return if there is no common factor that connects any numbers?
     - If no numbers share a common factor besides 1, each number is its own component, so the size of the largest component would be `1`.

## Strategy

1. **Union-Find Data Structure (Disjoint Set Union - DSU):**
   - Use Union-Find to keep track of components.
   - We need to efficiently union nodes that share a common factor and find their representative.

2. **Factorization and Union Process:**
   - Factorize each number in `A` to determine its prime factors.
   - Use these factors for union operations to group numbers that are connected via common factors.

3. **Computational Steps:**
   - For each number in the array, find all of its prime factors.
   - Use DSU to union numbers that share any prime factor.
   - The largest set in the DSU will represent the largest connected component in the graph.

4. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - Efficient factorization using a method similar to the Sieve of Eratosthenes.
   - Union-Find with path compression and union by rank for efficient union and find operations.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class LargestComponentSizeByCommonFactor {

    public int largestComponentSize(int[] A) {
        int max = Arrays.stream(A).max().getAsInt();
        UnionFind uf = new UnionFind(max + 1);

        for (int num : A) {
            for (int factor = 2; factor * factor <= num; factor++) {
                if (num % factor == 0) {
                    uf.union(num, factor);
                    uf.union(num, num / factor);
                }
            }
        }

        int[] count = new int[max + 1];
        int maxSize = 0;
        for (int num : A) {
            int root = uf.find(num);
            count[root]++;
            maxSize = Math.max(maxSize, count[root]);
        }

        return maxSize;
    }

    class UnionFind {
        private int[] parent;
        private int[] rank;
        
        public UnionFind(int size) {
            parent = new int[size];
            rank = new int[size];
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                parent[i] = i;
                rank[i] = 1;
            }
        }
        
        public int find(int x) {
            if (parent[x] != x) {
                parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
            }
            return parent[x];
        }
        
        public void union(int x, int y) {
            int rootX = find(x);
            int rootY = find(y);
            if (rootX != rootY) {
                if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]) {
                    parent[rootY] = rootX;
                } else if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]) {
                    parent[rootX] = rootY;
                } else {
                    parent[rootY] = rootX;
                    rank[rootX]++;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LargestComponentSizeByCommonFactor solution = new LargestComponentSizeByCommonFactor();
        int[] A = {4, 6, 15, 35};
        System.out.println(solution.largestComponentSize(A)); // Output: 4
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Factorization:**
   - For each number `num` in `A`, factorization takes `O(sqrt(num))` time.
   - In the worst-case scenario, the sum of âˆšnum over all elements is `O(n * sqrt(max(A)))`.

2. **Union-Find Operations:**
   - Union and find operations are nearly constant time with path compression and union by rank.
   - For `n` elements, it's practically `O(n)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is approximately `O(n * log(n))` considering the practical performance of the Union-Find operations.
