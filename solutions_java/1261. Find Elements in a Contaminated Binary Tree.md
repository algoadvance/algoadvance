[Leetcode 1261. Find Elements in a Contaminated Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1261)
### Problem Statement

You have a contaminated binary tree, where every node's value is `-1`. You need to first recover the binary tree using the following steps:

1. The root's value is set to `0`.
2. If the value of a node is `x`, then the value of its left child is `2 * x + 1`, and the value of its right child is `2 * x + 2`.

Once recovered, implement the `FindElements` class with the following functionalities:

- `FindElements(TreeNode root)`: Initializes the object with the given tree's root.
- `boolean find(int target)`: Returns `true` if the target value exists in the tree, and `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the input tree be empty?
2. Are there any constraints on the depth of the tree?
3. Is the input always correctly forming a binary tree without missing children that could break the pattern?

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;

    TreeNode(int x) {
        val = x;
    }
}

class FindElements {
    private Set<Integer> valuesSet;

    public FindElements(TreeNode root) {
        valuesSet = new HashSet<>();
        recoverTree(root, 0);
    }

    private void recoverTree(TreeNode node, int value) {
        if (node == null) {
            return;
        }
        node.val = value;
        valuesSet.add(value);
        recoverTree(node.left, 2 * value + 1);
        recoverTree(node.right, 2 * value + 2);
    }

    public boolean find(int target) {
        return valuesSet.contains(target);
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Create a `Set<Integer>` to store the values of the tree nodes as they are recovered.

2. **Recover Tree**:
   - Use a helper method `recoverTree(TreeNode node, int value)` to recursively recover the tree.
   - If the current node is not `null`, set its value and add it to the set.
   - Recursively call the helper method for the left and right children with the appropriate calculations for their values (`2 * value + 1` for left child and `2 * value + 2` for right child).

3. **Find Method**:
   - To find if a target exists in the tree, simply check if the value is in the set using the `contains` method.

### Time Complexity

1. **Initialization**:
   - The `recoverTree` method visits each node exactly once. Given \(n\) nodes, the time complexity is \(O(n)\).
   - Inserting elements into a `HashSet` also takes \(O(1)\) on average.

2. **Find Method**:
   - The `find` method checks set membership, which takes \(O(1)\) time on average.

Therefore, the overall time complexity for initialization (`FindElements(TreeNode root)`) is \(O(n)\), and for finding (`find(int target)`) is \(O(1)\).
