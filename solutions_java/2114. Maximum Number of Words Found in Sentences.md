[Leetcode 2114. Maximum Number of Words Found in Sentences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2114)
### Problem Statement
You are given a list of sentences, where each sentence is a string. Your task is to return the maximum number of words found in any single sentence.

### Clarifying Questions
Before we proceed, here are some questions to clarify the problem:

1. **Format of Input**: Is the input always a list of sentences (strings)?
2. **Word Definition**: How is a word defined? Are there any special characters or delimiters we need to handle, or is a word simply defined as a sequence of non-space characters?
3. **Sentence Constraints**: Are there constraints on the length of sentences or the number of sentences?
4. **Output Format**: Should the output be an integer representing the maximum number of words, or is there some other format required?

Assuming typical constraints and definitions:
- Each sentence is a string of words separated by spaces.
- There are up to \(10^4\) sentences.
- Each sentence has at most \(10^4\) characters.

### Code
Below is a Java implementation to solve the given problem:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int mostWordsFound(String[] sentences) {
        int maxWords = 0;
        
        for (String sentence : sentences) {
            // Split each sentence by spaces to get words
            String[] words = sentence.split(" ");
            // Update the maximum words count
            maxWords = Math.max(maxWords, words.length);
        }
        
        return maxWords;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        
        String[] sentences = {
            "alice and bob love leetcode",
            "i think so too",
            "this is great thanks very much"
        };
        
        System.out.println(sol.mostWordsFound(sentences));  // Output: 6
    }
}
```

### Strategy
1. **Initialization**: Declare a variable `maxWords` to keep track of the maximum number of words found in a sentence.
2. **Iterate through Sentences**: Loop through each sentence in the input array.
3. **Word Count**: For each sentence, split the sentence into words using space (`" "`) as the delimiter.
4. **Update Maximum**: Update `maxWords` if the number of words in the current sentence is greater than the previously recorded maximum.
5. **Final Result**: After the loop completes, return the `maxWords`.

### Time Complexity
- **Splitting Each Sentence**: Splitting a sentence of \(n\) characters takes \(O(n)\) time.
- **Total Time Complexity**: If there are \(m\) sentences with combined length \(N\) characters, the total time complexity is \(O(N)\). This is because each character is read, split, and counted once.

### Space Complexity
- **Space for Split Operation**: The space used by the `.split(" ")` method is proportional to the number of words in a sentence, which would be managed by Java's internal optimizations.
- **Overall**: The space complexity is \(O(N)\) for storing the split words temporarily.

This solution efficiently calculates the maximum number of words in any sentence using straightforward string manipulation techniques.
