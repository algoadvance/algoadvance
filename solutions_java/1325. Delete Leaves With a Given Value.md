[Leetcode 1325. Delete Leaves With a Given Value](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1325)
### Problem Statement

Given a binary tree root and an integer target, delete all the **leaf nodes** with value `target`.

Note that once you delete a leaf node with value `target`, if its parent node becomes a leaf node and it has the value `target`, it should also be deleted (you need to continue doing that until you cannot).

You need to return the root of the tree after modifying the tree in the above-mentioned way.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: root = [1,2,3,2,null,2,4], target = 2
Output: [1,null,3,null,4]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the structure of the tree?**
   - The tree is a binary tree, which means each node has at most two children.

2. **What should be returned when the root itself is deleted?**
   - If the root is deleted, return `null`.

3. **Are there any constraints on the values of the nodes?**
   - The values of the nodes are integers, and so is the target.

4. **What is the range of the values of the nodes and the target?**
   - Generally, it will be within the standard range of integer values.

### Strategy

1. **Recursive Post-order Traversal:** 
   - We will perform a post-order traversal (left-right-root). 
   - This approach ensures that we first deal with the leaf nodes before checking the parent nodes.

2. **Delete Nodes if They Match the Target:**
   - In the post-order traversal, check if a node is a leaf and matches the target. If so, delete it by returning `null`.

3. **Continue the process till no more nodes can be deleted:**
   - After processing all child nodes, check if the current node turns into a leaf node after its children are potentially removed. If so, and it matches the target, it should also be removed.

### Code

```java
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

public class Solution {
    public TreeNode removeLeafNodes(TreeNode root, int target) {
        // Call the recursive function to process the tree
        return removeLeaves(root, target);
    }

    private TreeNode removeLeaves(TreeNode node, int target) {
        if (node == null) {
            return null;
        }

        // Recursively process the left and right subtrees first
        node.left = removeLeaves(node.left, target);
        node.right = removeLeaves(node.right, target);

        // Check if the current node is a leaf and matches the target
        if (node.left == null && node.right == null && node.val == target) {
            return null; // Delete the leaf node by returning null
        }

        return node; // Return the current node otherwise
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is **O(N)**, where `N` is the number of nodes in the binary tree. 

- This is because we visit each node exactly once during the recursive post-order traversal.
- Each node's operation (checking if it's a leaf and updating children) occurs in constant time O(1).

The space complexity, due to the recursion stack, is **O(H)**, where `H` is the height of the tree. In the worst case (skewed tree), `H` can be as large as `N`, and in the best case (balanced tree), `H` is about `log(N)`.
