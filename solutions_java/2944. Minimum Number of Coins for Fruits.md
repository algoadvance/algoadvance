[Leetcode 2944. Minimum Number of Coins for Fruits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2944)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of `fruits` where each element is an integer representing the type of fruit. You are also given a `basketSize` which indicates the maximum number of different types of fruits you can keep in your basket at any given time. If you encounter a fruit of a new type and your basket is already at capacity, you must discard one type of fruit to make space for the new type. Your task is to determine the minimum number of fruit types you need to discard as you collect all the fruits from the list.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the order of traversal through the `fruits` list important?**
   - Yes, we traverse the list in the given order.

2. **Are there any constraints on the values of `fruits` or `basketSize`?**
   - `1 <= fruits.length <= 10^5`
   - `1 <= fruits[i] <= 10^5`
   - `1 <= basketSize <= fruits.length`

3. **What should be done when multiple fruits need to be discarded?**
   - Discard any fruit type of your choice, as the goal is to minimize the changes.

### Strategy

We can utilize the sliding window approach along with a hashmap to count the frequency of fruit types within the current window. Here's the step-by-step breakdown:

1. Use a sliding window to maintain the count of fruit types within the current range.
2. Track the starting index of the window and expand it by including new fruits encountered.
3. If the number of different fruit types exceeds `basketSize`, shrink the window from the start until the number of different fruit types is within the allowed size.
4. Track and update the count of discards during the resizing process of the window.

### Code

Here's the Java implementation of the solution:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class MinimumNumberOfCoinsForFruits {
    public static int minNumberOfDiscards(int[] fruits, int basketSize) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> fruitCount = new HashMap<>();
        int start = 0;
        int discards = 0;
        
        for (int end = 0; end < fruits.length; end++) {
            fruitCount.put(fruits[end], fruitCount.getOrDefault(fruits[end], 0) + 1);
            
            while (fruitCount.size() > basketSize) {
                fruitCount.put(fruits[start], fruitCount.get(fruits[start]) - 1);
                
                if (fruitCount.get(fruits[start]) == 0) {
                    fruitCount.remove(fruits[start]);
                    discards++;
                }
                start++;
            }
        }
        
        return discards;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] fruits = {1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int basketSize = 2;
        System.out.println(minNumberOfDiscards(fruits, basketSize)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) — Where `n` is the length of the fruits array. Both adding elements to the hashmap and potentially sliding the window involve linear time operations in the worst case.
- **Space Complexity:** O(basketSize) — In the worst case, the hashmap could store up to `basketSize` different fruit types at any given time.

This approach ensures efficient management of the sliding window while keeping track of the minimum number of discards required to adhere to the basket size constraint.
