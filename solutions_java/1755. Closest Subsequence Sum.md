[Leetcode 1755. Closest Subsequence Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1755)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `goal`.

You want to choose a subsequence of `nums` such that the sum of the subsequence is the closest to `goal`. The subsequence sum is the sum of its elements. You can choose any subsequence of `nums`.

Return the absolute difference between the sum of the chosen subsequence and `goal`.

### Example:
- Example 1:
  - Input: nums = [5,-7,3,5], goal = 6
  - Output: 0
  - Explanation: Choose the whole array as a subsequence, with a sum of 6 which is equal to the goal, so the absolute difference is 0.
  
- Example 2:
  - Input: nums = [7,-9,15,-2], goal = -5
  - Output: 1
  - Explanation: Choose the subsequence [-2], with a sum of -2 which is closest to goal, so absolute difference is 1.
  
- Example 3:
  - Input: nums = [1,2,3], goal = -7
  - Output: 7
  - Explanation: Choose an empty subsequence, with a sum of 0 which is closest to goal, so absolute difference is 7.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 40`
- `-10^7 <= nums[i] <= 10^7`
- `-10^9 <= goal <= 10^9`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the exact meaning of a subsequence?**
   - A subsequence is a sequence derived from another sequence where some elements may be deleted without changing the order of the remaining elements.

2. **What is the expected length of the subsequence?**
   - There's no specific restriction provided. It can range from 0 elements (an empty subsequence) to the length of the entire array.

3. **Is the subset sum required to be exact?**
   - No, the subset sum need not be exact; it just needs to be the closest possible to the provided `goal`.

## Strategy

1. **Understanding Constraints**: Given that `nums` can have up to 40 elements, a brute force approach (considering all subsequences) would be infeasible due to the exponential growth in subsequence combinations.

2. **Meet in the Middle**: We can leverage the "meet-in-the-middle" technique to divide the problem into two smaller subproblems:
   - Divide the `nums` array into two halves.
   - Calculate all possible sums from both halves.
   - Use these sums to find the closest subsequence sum to the `goal`.

3. **Binary Search**: To efficiently find the closest sums, we can use binary search on the sorted list of sums from one of the halves.

### Code

Here's a complete Java solution using the described strategy.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class ClosestSubsequenceSum {
    public int minAbsDifference(int[] nums, int goal) {
        // Splitting the array into two halves
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] left = Arrays.copyOfRange(nums, 0, n / 2);
        int[] right = Arrays.copyOfRange(nums, n / 2, n);
        
        // Generating all possible sums of subsequences for both halves
        List<Integer> leftSums = generateSums(left);
        List<Integer> rightSums = generateSums(right);
        
        // Sort one of the sums list to perform binary search
        Collections.sort(rightSums);
        
        // Finding the closest sum
        int minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int leftSum : leftSums) {
            int required = goal - leftSum;
            // Using binary search to find the closest sum in rightSums to 'required'
            int pos = Collections.binarySearch(rightSums, required);
            if (pos >= 0) {
                return 0; // if exactly found
            } else {
                // if not found, binarySearch gives insertion point
                pos = -pos - 1;
                // Check the closest values around the insertion point
                if (pos < rightSums.size()) {
                    minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, Math.abs(leftSum + rightSums.get(pos) - goal));
                }
                if (pos > 0) {
                    minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, Math.abs(leftSum + rightSums.get(pos - 1) - goal));
                }
            }
        }
        
        return minDiff;
    }

    private List<Integer> generateSums(int[] nums) {
        List<Integer> sums = new ArrayList<>();
        int n = nums.length;
        // Generating all possible sums using bitmasks
        for (int i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if ((i & (1 << j)) != 0) {
                    sum += nums[j];
                }
            }
            sums.add(sum);
        }
        return sums;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ClosestSubsequenceSum solution = new ClosestSubsequenceSum();
        System.out.println(solution.minAbsDifference(new int[]{5, -7, 3, 5}, 6)); // Output: 0
        System.out.println(solution.minAbsDifference(new int[]{7, -9, 15, -2}, -5)); // Output: 1
        System.out.println(solution.minAbsDifference(new int[]{1, 2, 3}, -7)); // Output: 7
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Generating sums**: For each half of the array, we generate all possible sums, which takes \(O(2^{n/2})\) per half, leading to \(O(2^{n/2}\) for both halves.
2. **Sorting**: Sorting one of the lists takes \(O(2^{n/2} \log 2^{n/2}) = O(n 2^{n/2})\).
3. **Binary Search**: Each binary search operation takes \(O(\log 2^{n/2}) = O(n/2) = O(n)\).

Overall time complexity is \(O(2^{n/2} \cdot n)\), which is feasible given \(n \leq 40\).
