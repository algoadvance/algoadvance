[Leetcode 899. Orderly Queue](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l899)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, you need to return the lexicographically smallest string that can be obtained after applying the following operation any number of times:

- Choose one of the first `k` letters of `s` and move it to the end of the string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
   **A:** The length of `s` can be up to 1000.

2. **Q:** Is the input string `s` guaranteed to contain only lowercase English letters?
   **A:** Yes, `s` contains only lowercase English letters.

3. **Q:** What are the constraints on the integer `k`?
   **A:** `k` will be between 1 and the length of the string `s`.

### Strategy
1. **If `k == 1`:**
   - When `k` is 1, we can only move the first character of `s` to the end of the string. In this case, we need to consider all possible rotations of the string and find the smallest one.
   
2. **If `k > 1`:**
   - When `k` is greater than 1, we can use any character in the first `k` characters, allowing us to sort the string. This is because with `k` greater than 1, we can effectively change the order of the entire string.

### Code
```java
public class OrderlyQueue {
    public String orderlyQueue(String s, int k) {
        if (k == 1) {
            String smallest = s;
            for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
                String rotation = s.substring(i) + s.substring(0, i);
                if (rotation.compareTo(smallest) < 0) {
                    smallest = rotation;
                }
            }
            return smallest;
        } else {
            char[] chars = s.toCharArray();
            Arrays.sort(chars);
            return new String(chars);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OrderlyQueue oq = new OrderlyQueue();
        System.out.println(oq.orderlyQueue("cba", 1)); // Output: "acb"
        System.out.println(oq.orderlyQueue("baaca", 3)); // Output: "aaabc"
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
1. **`k == 1` Case:**
   - We generate all possible rotations of the string, and each rotation takes `O(n)` time to compute the lexicographical comparison, involving `O(n^2)` time complexity in total, where `n` is the length of the string.

2. **`k > 1` Case:**
   - Sorting the string has a time complexity of `O(n log n)`.

### Example Walkthrough
1. **Example 1:**
   - Input: `s = "cba", k = 1`
   - Possible rotations: "cba", "bac", "acb"
   - Lexicographically smallest: "acb"
   - Output: `"acb"`

2. **Example 2:**
   - Input: `s = "baaca", k = 3`
   - Sorted string: "aaabc"
   - Output: `"aaabc"`

This approach efficiently handles both scenarios, providing an optimal and corrected result.
