[Leetcode 2424. Longest Uploaded Prefix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2424)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n` representing the total number of videos and a stream of integers `videoIds` representing the identifiers of videos that have been uploaded in order. Each `videoId` is a positive integer between `1` and `n` (inclusive) and each `videoId` is unique. The longest uploaded prefix is the longest contiguous prefix of video identifiers that does not have any gaps between them. A contiguous prefix of the video identifier stream is called valid if it consists of the consecutive integers `1, 2, 3, ..., k` for some positive integer `k` and does not have any gaps.

Implement the `LUPrefix` class:

- `LUPrefix(int n)` Initializes the object with `n` as the total number of videos.
- `void upload(int videoId)` Simulates the upload of `videoId` video.
- `int longest()` Returns the length of the longest uploaded prefix.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= videoId <= n`
- All `videoId`s are unique.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Does the videoIds stream need to be handled in real-time?**
   Yes, each `upload` call is processed as it happens.

2. **Do we need to handle multiple calls to `longest` in between uploads?**
   Yes, the `longest` function can be called at any point and should return the correct value.

3. **Are there any edge cases we need to consider?**
   Yes:
   - Uploads are done in a non-sequential order.
   - The `longest` function might be called before any uploads are processed.

## Strategy

To solve this problem effectively:
- We'll use a boolean array `uploaded` to keep track of which videos have been uploaded.
- Maintain an integer `longestPrefix` to keep track of the current longest continuous prefix.
- When uploading a video, mark its position in the array. Then, if it is exactly the next video in the continuous prefix order (`longestPrefix + 1`), update the `longestPrefix` and check subsequent videos in the array until we find a gap.

## Code
```java
public class LUPrefix {
    private boolean[] uploaded;
    private int longestPrefix;

    public LUPrefix(int n) {
        uploaded = new boolean[n + 1]; // +1 to make index 1-based
        longestPrefix = 0;
    }

    public void upload(int videoId) {
        uploaded[videoId] = true;
        while (longestPrefix + 1 < uploaded.length && uploaded[longestPrefix + 1]) {
            longestPrefix++;
        }
    }

    public int longest() {
        return longestPrefix;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LUPrefix lup = new LUPrefix(4);
        System.out.println(lup.longest()); // Output: 0
        lup.upload(3);
        System.out.println(lup.longest()); // Output: 0
        lup.upload(1);
        System.out.println(lup.longest()); // Output: 1
        lup.upload(2);
        System.out.println(lup.longest()); // Output: 3
        lup.upload(4);
        System.out.println(lup.longest()); // Output: 4
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Initialization (`LUPrefix`)**: `O(n)` due to the creation of the boolean array.
- **Upload (`upload`)**: Average case `O(1)` (amortized). Since we only move `longestPrefix` forward when a sequence is matched.
- **Longest (`longest`)**: `O(1)`, simple return of the `longestPrefix` value.
