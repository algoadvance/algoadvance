[Leetcode 1311. Get Watched Videos by Your Friends](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1311)
### Problem Statement

You are given two arrays `watchedVideos` and `friends` where `watchedVideos[i]` and `friends[i]` contain the list of watched videos and friends of the person with index `i` respectively.

Level 1 friends of any given person are their direct friends. Level 2 friends are direct friends of their direct friends and so on.

Given your `id` and the level `l`, find the videos watched by the level `l` friends and return them in a list sorted by the frequency of each video (in ascending order). For videos with the same frequency, sort them alphabetically.

#### Constraints:
- `n == watchedVideos.length == friends.length`
- `2 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= watchedVideos[i].length <= 100`
- `1 <= watchedVideos[i][j].length <= 8`
- `0 <= friends[i][j] < n`
- `0 <= id < n`
- `1 <= l <= 2`
- `There can be multiple friends at the same level l. Videos should be sorted by alphabetical order if frequencies are the same.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum length of each video name?**
   The maximum length for each video name is 8 characters.

2. **Can a person have no friends?**
   No, based on constraints each person will have friends.

3. **Can the result have duplicate video names with the same frequency?**
   No, each video should be counted once per viewing.

4. **Can there be multiple friends at the same level l?**
   Yes, the constraint specifically mentions that.

### Strategy

1. **BFS (Breadth-First Search):**
   - Utilize BFS to traverse the friends' network to determine the friends at level `l` starting from the given `id`.

2. **Collect Videos:**
   - Gather videos watched by these level `l` friends and count their frequencies.

3. **Sorting:**
   - Sort the collected videos primarily based on frequency (ascending) and then alphabetically.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<String> watchedVideosByFriends(List<List<String>> watchedVideos, List<List<Integer>> friends, int id, int l) {
        int n = friends.size();
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        
        // BFS to find level l friends
        queue.offer(id);
        visited[id] = true;
        int level = 0;
        
        while(!queue.isEmpty() && level < l) {
            int size = queue.size();
            level++;
            for(int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                int current = queue.poll();
                for(int friend : friends.get(current)) {
                    if(!visited[friend]) {
                        queue.offer(friend);
                        visited[friend] = true;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Collect videos at level l friends
        Map<String, Integer> videoCount = new HashMap<>();
        while(!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int friendAtLevelL = queue.poll();
            for(String video : watchedVideos.get(friendAtLevelL)) {
                videoCount.put(video, videoCount.getOrDefault(video, 0) + 1);
            }
        }
        
        // Sort videos by frequency and then by alphabet
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>(videoCount.keySet());
        result.sort((a, b) -> {
            int freqCompare = videoCount.get(a).compareTo(videoCount.get(b));
            if (freqCompare == 0) {
                return a.compareTo(b);
            }
            return freqCompare;
        });
        
        return result;
    }

    // Main method for testing the code
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        List<List<String>> watchedVideos = Arrays.asList(
                Arrays.asList("A", "B"),
                Arrays.asList("C"),
                Arrays.asList("B", "C"),
                Arrays.asList("D")
        );
        List<List<Integer>> friends = Arrays.asList(
                Arrays.asList(1, 2),
                Arrays.asList(0, 3),
                Arrays.asList(0, 3),
                Arrays.asList(1, 2)
        );
        int id = 0;
        int level = 2;
        System.out.println(sol.watchedVideosByFriends(watchedVideos, friends, id, level));
        // Output should be: ["C", "D"]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **BFS Traversal:** Finding friends at level `l` requires traversing the graph which takes `O(n + e)` where `n` is the number of nodes (friends) and `e` is the number of edges (friend relationships).
2. **Collecting Videos:** Collecting videos and counting them takes `O(v * f)` where `v` is the maximum number of videos watched by a friend and `f` is the number of level `l` friends.
3. **Sorting Videos:** Sorting the videos based on frequency and then alphabetically takes `O(m log m)` where `m` is the number of unique videos.

**Overall Time Complexity:** `O(n + e + v * f + m log m)` which is efficient given the problem constraints.
