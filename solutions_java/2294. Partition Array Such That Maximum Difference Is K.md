[Leetcode 2294. Partition Array Such That Maximum Difference Is K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2294)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of integers and an integer `k`, partition the array into the minimum number of subsequences such that the difference between the maximum and minimum values in each subsequence is at most `k`.

Return *the minimum number of subsequences* needed.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of values for `nums`?
   - Let's assume that `nums` can contain a mix of positive, negative, and zero integers.
   
2. Is the input array guaranteed to be non-empty?
   - Yes, the problem statement implies that the input array is non-empty.

3. What is the range of values for `k`?
   - Let's assume `k` is a non-negative integer.

4. Are the sequences order matters?
   - No, subsequences are a set of numbers and their order does not matter.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Array**: This helps in grouping closer numbers together efficiently.
2. **Initialize Counters**: We'll need a counter for the number of subsequences and a variable to keep track of the start of the current subsequence.
3. **Iterate through the Array**: For each number, determine if adding it to the current subsequence would keep the maximum difference within `k`. If not, start a new subsequence.
4. **Count Subsequences**: Keep track of how many subsequences we create and ensure each satisfies the maximum difference condition.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class PartitionArrayMaxDiff {

    public static int partitionArray(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Sort the array first
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        
        // Start with one subsequence
        int subsequences = 1;
        int start = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            // If the difference between the current element and the start
            // of the current subsequence is greater than k,
            // start a new subsequence
            if (nums[i] - nums[start] > k) {
                subsequences++;
                start = i; // Update the start to the current position
            }
        }
        
        return subsequences;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {3, 6, 1, 2, 5}; // Example array
        int k = 2; // Example k value
        System.out.println(partitionArray(nums, k)); // Output should be 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the Array**: O(n log n), where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **Iterating through the Array**: O(n).

The overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, so it's O(n log n).

This solution ensures that we achieve the minimum number of partitions where the maximum difference within each partition is at most `k`.
