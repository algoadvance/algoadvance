[Leetcode 3192. Minimum Operations to Make Binary Array Elements Equal to One II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3192)
Sure, let's break down the problem-solving process. 

### Problem Statement:
We are given a binary array (consisting of only `0`s and `1`s), and we need to perform a minimum number of operations to make all elements in the array equal to `1`. The allowed operation is to flip the value of any contiguous subarray. Our task is to compute the minimum number of such operations required.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Constraints:** 
   - What is the size range of the array?
   - Is the array guaranteed to be non-empty?
   
2. **Operations Definition:**
   - Are we allowed to flip any contiguous subarray multiple times as part of the solution?
   
3. **Output Requirements:**
   - Should the function return the number of operations as an integer?

Assuming the typical constraints:
1. The size of the array can be up to 10^5.
2. The array is non-empty.

### Strategy:
To tackle the problem, we can use a greedy algorithm. The key point is that each time we encounter a `0`, we can flip the smallest subarray starting from that `0` to turn it into a `1`. However, we need to ensure that future flips take into account the already flipped subarrays.

1. Iterate through the array from left to right.
2. When we encounter a `0`, flip the subarray starting from this `0` to the next `1` (if any), marking the positions that have been flipped.
3. Count each flip as an operation.

The problem can also be optimally solved using a more sophisticated approach involving the concept of prefix XOR and parity tracking in advanced scenarios. For simplicity and efficiency at a basic level, we'll focus on the greedy approach.

### Java Code:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minOperationsToMakeAllOnes(int[] nums) {
        int operations = 0;
        boolean isFlipped = false;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            // Determine the actual value considering the flips
            int actualValue = nums[i] ^ (isFlipped ? 1 : 0);

            if (actualValue == 0) {
                // We need to flip starting from the current index
                operations++;
                // Flip the state
                isFlipped = !isFlipped;
            }
        }

        return operations;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] testArray1 = {0, 1, 0, 1, 0};  // Example Test Case
        System.out.println(solution.minOperationsToMakeAllOnes(testArray1)); // Expected Output: 3
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this approach is `O(n)` since we only perform a single pass through the array.
- The space complexity is `O(1)` as we're using a constant amount of additional space regardless of the input size.

By leveraging the idea of flipping states and tracking the parity of flips, we're able to determine the minimal number of operations efficiently.
