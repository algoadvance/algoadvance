[Leetcode 2592. Maximize Greatness of an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2592)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums`. The "greatness" of the array is defined as the number of instances of index pairs `(i, j)` such that `nums[i] < nums[j]` and `i < j`. Your task is to determine the maximum greatness of the array by potentially rearranging its elements.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input array `nums` be empty?
   - No, as per typical constraints in such problems, we'll assume `nums` has at least one element.
2. What is the maximum possible size of the array?
   - We will assume typical constraints such as in competitive programming problems, where `nums.length` can be up to `10^5`.
3. Can the elements of `nums` be negative or zero?
   - Yes, `nums` can include negative integers, positive integers, and zero.
4. Are there any constraints on how many times an element can appear in `nums`?
   - No, thereâ€™s no constraint on the number of times an element can appear.

## Strategy
To maximize the greatness of the array, we need to maximize the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that `nums[i] < nums[j]` and `i < j`. To achieve this, we can:
1. Sort the array `nums` in non-decreasing order.
2. Using two pointers, iterate over the sorted array from both ends, attempting to pair the smallest unmatched element with the largest unmatched element that is larger than the current small element.

### Detailed Steps
1. Sort the array.
2. Initialize two pointers, one at the start (`i`) and one at the next of starting pointer (`j`), iterate through the array comparing elements:
   - If `nums[i] < nums[j]`, it implies a valid pair `(i, j)`, then increment the greatness count and move both pointers, `i` and `j`.
   - If `nums[i]` is not less than `nums[j]`, increment only `j` to look for the next larger element.
3. Continue until all pairs are checked.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MaximizeGreatness {
    public static int maximizeGreatness(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int i = 0, j = 1;
        int greatness = 0;
        
        // Traverse the sorted array to find number of valid pairs
        while (j < nums.length) {
            if (nums[i] < nums[j]) {
                greatness++;
                i++;
                j++;
            } else {
                j++;
            }
        }
        
        return greatness;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {3, 5, 1, 2, 4};  // Example input
        System.out.println(maximizeGreatness(nums));  // Expected output: 3
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Sorting the array takes `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the length of the array.
- The two-pointer traversal to count valid pairs takes `O(n)`.
- Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, yielding `O(n log n)`.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is `O(1)` (excluding the space needed to store the input and sorted array, which is done in-place).

The given approach effectively leverages sorting to maximize the number of valid pairs in a way that is efficient both in terms of time and space.
