[Leetcode 162. Find Peak Element](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l162)
## Problem Statement:

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors. Given an integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index to any of the peaks.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = -∞` and `nums[n] = -∞` (an element outside of the array is treated as negative infinity).

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

### Example:
1. ```
   Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
   Output: 2
   Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
   ```

2. ```
   Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
   Output: 5
   Explanation: Your function can return either index number 5 where the peak element is 6, or index number 1 where the peak element is 2.
   ```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`
- `nums[i] != nums[i + 1]` for all valid `i`.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can the input array contain only one element?**
   - Yes, and in that case, that single element is the peak element.
2. **Are we allowed to modify the input array?**
   - No, we should not modify the input array.
3. **What should be returned if there are multiple peak elements?**
   - Return the index of any one of the peak elements.

## Strategy:

Since the problem requires finding a peak element in `O(log n)` time, a binary search approach is suitable. Here's how we can do it:

1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, at the start and end of the array, respectively.
2. While `left` is less than `right`, calculate the middle index `mid = (left + right) / 2`.
3. Compare the middle element with its next element:
   - If `nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]`, it means the peak lies to the right of `mid`, so set `left = mid + 1`.
   - Otherwise, the peak lies to the left of `mid` or it is `mid` itself, so set `right = mid`.
4. After the loop ends, `left` and `right` will converge to the peak element, return `left` (or `right`, they will be the same).

## Code:

```java
public class FindPeakElement {
    public int findPeakElement(int[] nums) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;
        
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2; // To avoid potential overflow
            
            if (nums[mid] < nums[mid + 1]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        
        return left;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FindPeakElement solution = new FindPeakElement();
        
        int[] nums1 = {1, 2, 3, 1};
        System.out.println(solution.findPeakElement(nums1)); // Output: 2
        
        int[] nums2 = {1, 2, 1, 3, 5, 6, 4};
        System.out.println(solution.findPeakElement(nums2)); // Output: 5 (or 1)
        
        int[] nums3 = {1};
        System.out.println(solution.findPeakElement(nums3)); // Output: 0
        
        int[] nums4 = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        System.out.println(solution.findPeakElement(nums4)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:

The algorithm runs in `O(log n)` time because we are effectively halving the search space in each iteration of the while loop. The space complexity is `O(1)` since no additional space proportional to the input size is used.
