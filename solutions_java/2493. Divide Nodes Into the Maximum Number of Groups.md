[Leetcode 2493. Divide Nodes Into the Maximum Number of Groups](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2493)
### Problem Statement

You are given an undirected graph represented by `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n` and edges represented by a 2D integer array `edges`, where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` denotes that there exists a bidirectional edge between nodes `ui` and `vi`.

Your task is to divide the nodes of this graph into the maximum number of groups such that:

1. No two nodes within the same group are adjacent.
2. Each node must belong to exactly one group.

Return the maximum number of groups or `-1` if it is impossible to divide the nodes under the above criteria.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can there be nodes with no edges?
   - Yes, nodes may have no edges.
2. Is the given graph connected?
   - The graph might or might not be connected.
3. What should we do if the given graph canâ€™t be divided into such groups?
   - Return `-1` if it's impossible.

### Strategy

This problem can be approached using graph coloring, specifically by checking if the graph is bipartite. If the graph is bipartite, it can be colored with two colors such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color, implying the graph can be divided into two groups. The problem here is to maximize the number of groups, which means checking if we can color the graph with more than two colors (if it's not bipartite).

A graph is k-colorable if it can be colored with k different colors such that no two adjacent nodes have the same color. In essence, this problem can be simplified to finding out if the graph is k-colorable for the largest possible k.

Here's the algorithm:
1. Check if the graph is k-colorable for increasing values of k until you can't color it.
2. Return the maximum k for which the graph is k-colorable.

For implementation:
1. Use BFS or DFS to attempt coloring the graph.
2. Check for each k from 2 to n (since we can't have more than n colors).
3. If we find a k for which the graph is k-colorable, store it as the current maximum and continue; stop once we fail to color the graph with `k`.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    // Check if the graph is k-colorable using DFS
    private boolean isKColorable(int[][] graph, int n, int k, int[] colors, int node) {
        for (int color = 1; color <= k; color++) {
            if (canColor(graph, colors, node, color)) {
                colors[node] = color;
                boolean canColorOthers = true;
                for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
                    if (graph[node][i] == 1 && colors[i] == 0 && !isKColorable(graph, n, k, colors, i)) {
                        canColorOthers = false;
                        break;
                    }
                }
                if (canColorOthers) return true;
                colors[node] = 0;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    // Check if it is safe to color a node with a particular color
    private boolean canColor(int[][] graph, int[] colors, int node, int color) {
        for (int i = 1; i < colors.length; i++) {
            if (graph[node][i] == 1 && colors[i] == color) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    public int maxGroups(int n, int[][] edges) {
        int[][] graph = new int[n + 1][n + 1];
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            graph[edge[0]][edge[1]] = 1;
            graph[edge[1]][edge[0]] = 1;
        }
        for (int k = n; k >= 1; k--) {
            if (isKColorable(graph, n, k, new int[n + 1], 1)) {
                return k;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[][] edges1 = {{1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 4}};
        System.out.println(solution.maxGroups(4, edges1)); // 3

        int[][] edges2 = {{1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 4}};
        System.out.println(solution.maxGroups(4, edges2)); // -1
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Checking K-colorability:** The worst-case complexity for checking if a graph is k-colorable using the current method is exponential in nature.

Therefore, the overall complexity is high, particularly when n is large, due to the factorial nature of the combinatorial problem of graph coloring. This approach is not efficient for larger graphs, and more sophisticated methods or heuristics would be needed for practical purposes.
