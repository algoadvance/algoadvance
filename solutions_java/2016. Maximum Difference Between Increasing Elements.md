[Leetcode 2016. Maximum Difference Between Increasing Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2016)
### Problem Statement
Given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` of size `n`, you need to find the maximum difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` (i.e., `nums[j] - nums[i]`), such that `0 <= i < j < n` and `nums[i] < nums[j]`. Return the maximum difference. If no such `i` and `j` exist, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the array can contain negative numbers.
2. **What is the maximum possible size of the array?**
   - The size of the array (`n`) can go up to `10^4`.
3. **Should the difference be strictly positive?**
   - Yes, we need `nums[j] > nums[i]`.
4. **What if the array has less than two elements?**
   - In that case, returning `-1` would be appropriate since finding such pairs is not possible.

### Strategy
1. **Initialize**:
   - A variable `min_element` to keep track of the minimum element seen so far and set it to `nums[0]`.
   - A variable `max_diff` to keep the maximum difference found and set it to `-1`.

2. **Iterate through the array**:
   - For each element starting from the second element, check if it is greater than `min_element`.
     - If true, update `max_diff` with the maximum of `max_diff` and (`current_element` - `min_element`).
   - Update `min_element` if the current element is smaller.

3. **Return**:
   - After iterating through the array, return `max_diff`.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array `nums`, since we only need a single pass through the array.
- The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a fixed amount of extra space.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maximumDifference(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length < 2) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        int min_element = nums[0];
        int max_diff = -1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > min_element) {
                max_diff = Math.max(max_diff, nums[i] - min_element);
            } else {
                min_element = nums[i];
            }
        }
        
        return max_diff;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int result = sol.maximumDifference(new int[]{7, 1, 5, 4});
        System.out.println(result); // Output should be 4 (5 - 1)
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: We initialize `min_element` to the first element and `max_diff` to `-1`.
2. **Iteration**: Start iterating from the second element. If the current element is greater than `min_element`, update `max_diff`. Otherwise, update `min_element`.
3. **Return**: Once the loop ends, return `max_diff`. If no valid `i, j` pairs were found, `max_diff` remains `-1`.
