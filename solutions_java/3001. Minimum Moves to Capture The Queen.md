[Leetcode 3001. Minimum Moves to Capture The Queen](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3001)
### Problem Statement

You are given an 8x8 chessboard, and you need to find the minimum number of moves for a knight to capture a queen. The knight and the queen are placed on the chessboard in such a way that their initial positions are given.

The knight moves in an "L" shape: two squares in a horizontal or vertical direction, followed by one square in a perpendicular direction. The queen moves horizontally, vertically, or diagonally any number of squares.

Given the coordinates of the knight and the queen, determine the minimum number of moves required for the knight to capture the queen. The coordinates are given as (row, col), both ranging from 0 to 7, inclusive.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format**: Is the input provided as two pairs of integers (knightRow, knightCol, queenRow, queenCol)?
    - Yes, the input is provided as two pairs of integers.

2. **Validity of Positions**: Can we assume that the input positions are always valid and within the 8x8 chessboard?
    - Yes, assume input positions are always valid and within bounds.

3. **Obstacles**: Are there any obstacles on the board, or is the board empty except for the knight and queen?
    - The board is empty except for the knight and queen.

4. **Output**: Should I return -1 if the knight cannot capture the queen (e.g., moves are not sufficient)?
    - No, you can assume the knight can always capture the queen if it's on the board, given sufficient moves.

### Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - Use BFS to explore all possible positions the knight can reach.
   - Keep track of visited positions to avoid cycles and redundant computations.
   - Each level of BFS will represent one move.

2. **Knight Moves**:
   - The knight has 8 possible moves from a given position: (±2, ±1) and (±1, ±2) combinations.
   
3. **Termination Condition**:
   - The BFS should terminate when the knight reaches the queen's position.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MinimumMovesCaptureQueen {
    // Directions a knight can move (8 possible moves)
    private static final int[][] KNIGHT_MOVES = {
        {-2, -1}, {-2, 1}, {-1, -2}, {-1, 2}, 
        {2, -1}, {2, 1}, {1, -2}, {1, 2}
    };

    // BFS to find the minimum moves
    public int minKnightMoves(int knightRow, int knightCol, int queenRow, int queenCol) {
        // If knight is already on the queen's position
        if (knightRow == queenRow && knightCol == queenCol) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        // Queue to hold knights positions and their move count
        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        // Set to hold visited positions
        Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
        
        // Enqueue initial position
        queue.add(new int[]{knightRow, knightCol, 0});
        visited.add(knightRow + "," + knightCol);
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] pos = queue.poll();
            int row = pos[0];
            int col = pos[1];
            int moves = pos[2];
            
            // Explore all possible knight moves
            for (int[] move : KNIGHT_MOVES) {
                int newRow = row + move[0];
                int newCol = col + move[1];
                
                // Check if the new position is within bounds
                if (newRow >= 0 && newRow < 8 && newCol >= 0 && newCol < 8) {
                    // Check if it is the queen's position
                    if (newRow == queenRow && newCol == queenCol) {
                        return moves + 1;
                    }
                    
                    // If not visited, mark as visited and enqueue
                    if (!visited.contains(newRow + "," + newCol)) {
                        visited.add(newRow + "," + newCol);
                        queue.add(new int[]{newRow, newCol, moves + 1});
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        // This point should never be reached given the problem statement assumptions
        return -1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumMovesCaptureQueen solution = new MinimumMovesCaptureQueen();
        int moves = solution.minKnightMoves(0, 0, 7, 7);
        System.out.println("Minimum moves: " + moves);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this BFS algorithm is `O(64 * 8) = O(512)`, which simplifies to `O(1)` since the chessboard has a fixed size (8x8). Thus, in practical scenarios, this is highly efficient and completes in constant time.
