[Leetcode 2088. Count Fertile Pyramids in a Land](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2088)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D grid of binary values representing a piece of land, where `0` denotes infertile land and `1` denotes fertile land. Your task is to count the number of fertile pyramids. A fertile pyramid is defined as follows:
- It has a height of at least 2.
- The top part of the pyramid is a single fertile square.
- Every row below the top has increasing widths of fertile squares that form an isosceles triangle.

For example, a valid pyramid of height 2 looks like this:
```
  1
 111
```
A valid pyramid of height 3 looks like this:
```
   1
  111
 11111
```
You need to count the total number of such pyramids in the grid.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Pyramid Base:** Should the pyramid base be entirely within the grid bounds?
   - Yes, the base and the entire height of the pyramid must be within the bounds of the grid.

2. **Grid Dimensions:** Is there any restriction on the dimensions of the grid?
   - No, there are no specific restrictions, but the grid will be reasonably sized as per usual constraints of similar problems on LeetCode.

3. **Multiple Pyramids Overlapping:** Can pyramids overlap with each other?
   - Yes, pyramids can overlap, and each valid pyramid should be counted.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Table:** Use a dynamic programming table to keep track of the maximum height of pyramids that can end at each cell.
2. **Upward and Downward Pyramids:**
   - **Downward Pyramid:** The tip starts from each cell and expands downward.
   - **Upward Pyramid:** The tip starts from each cell and expands upward.
   - Firstly count all downward pyramids, and then reverse the grid and count the new downward pyramids in this reversed grid to count upward pyramids.
3. **Base Condition:** A pyramid can only begin from a cell containing `1`.
4. **Transitional Formula:** Update the DP table by checking the conditions in adjacent cells.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int countPyramids(int[][] grid) {
        return countFertilePyramids(grid) + countFertilePyramids(reverseGrid(grid));
    }
    
    private int countFertilePyramids(int[][] grid) {
        int rows = grid.length;
        int cols = grid[0].length;
        int[][] dp = new int[rows][cols];
        int count = 0;
        
        for(int r = rows - 1; r >= 0; r--) {
            for(int c = 1; c < cols - 1; c++) {
                if (grid[r][c] == 1) {
                    if (r < rows - 1) {
                        dp[r][c] = Math.min(dp[r + 1][c - 1], Math.min(dp[r + 1][c], dp[r + 1][c + 1])) + 1;
                    } else {
                        dp[r][c] = 1;
                    }
                    count += dp[r][c] - 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    private int[][] reverseGrid(int[][] grid) {
        int rows = grid.length;
        int cols = grid[0].length;
        int[][] reversedGrid = new int[rows][cols];
        for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
            reversedGrid[r] = Arrays.copyOf(grid[rows - 1 - r], cols);
        }
        return reversedGrid;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[][] grid = {
            {0,1,0,1},
            {1,1,1,1},
            {0,1,1,1},
            {1,1,1,1}
        };
        System.out.println(sol.countPyramids(grid));  // Output the number of fertile pyramids
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **DP Table Construction:** O(rows * cols) for each of the DP table constructions.
- **Grid Reversal:** O(rows * cols)

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(rows * cols). This is efficient and appropriate for the problem constraints.
