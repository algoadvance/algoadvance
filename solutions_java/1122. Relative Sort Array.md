[Leetcode 1122. Relative Sort Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1122)
### Problem Statement

You are given two arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, where:
- `arr2` is a permutation of the unique values in `arr1`.
- Every element in `arr2` appears in `arr1`.

Sort the elements of `arr1` such that the relative ordering of items in `arr1` are the same as in `arr2`. Elements that do not appear in `arr2` should be placed at the end of `arr1` in ascending order.

**Example:**
```
Input: 
arr1 = [2,3,1,3,2,4,6,7,9,2,19]
arr2 = [2,1,4,3,9,6]

Output: 
[2,2,2,1,4,3,3,9,6,7,19]
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= arr1[i], arr2[i] <= 1000`
- All the elements of `arr2` are distinct.
- Each `arr2[i]` is in `arr1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any negative numbers in the arrays?**
   - No, the problem constraints indicate that numbers range from 0 to 1000.

2. **Can the arrays have repeated numbers?**
   - Yes, `arr1` can have repeated numbers but `arr2` contains unique elements.

3. **How should numbers that do not appear in `arr2` be sorted?**
   - They should be sorted in ascending order and placed at the end of `arr1`.

### Strategy

1. **Create a frequency map** for elements in `arr1`.
2. **Generate the result list** by adding elements in `arr2` order and then adding the rest in ascending order.
3. **Iterate through `arr1` and use the frequency map** to build the final array.
4. **Time Complexity**:
   - Building the frequency map: O(n) where n is the length of `arr1`.
   - Iterating and placing elements according to `arr2`: O(m) where m is the length of `arr2`.
   - Sorting remaining elements: O(k log k) where k is the number of elements not in `arr2`.
   - Combining these, the overall time complexity is O(n + k log k).

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class RelativeSortArray {
    public static int[] relativeSortArray(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
        int[] result = new int[arr1.length];
        Map<Integer, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Fill the frequency map for arr1
        for (int num : arr1) {
            frequencyMap.put(num, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }

        int index = 0;

        // Add elements of arr2 in the order they appear in arr2
        for (int num : arr2) {
            if (frequencyMap.containsKey(num)) {
                int count = frequencyMap.get(num);
                for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
                    result[index++] = num;
                }
                frequencyMap.remove(num);
            }
        }

        // Get remaining elements and sort them
        List<Integer> remainingElements = new ArrayList<>();
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : frequencyMap.entrySet()) {
            int num = entry.getKey();
            int count = entry.getValue();
            for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
                remainingElements.add(num);
            }
        }
        Collections.sort(remainingElements);
        
        // Add remaining sorted elements to result
        for (int num : remainingElements) {
            result[index++] = num;
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr1 = {2,3,1,3,2,4,6,7,9,2,19};
        int[] arr2 = {2,1,4,3,9,6};
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(relativeSortArray(arr1, arr2)));
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Building the `frequencyMap`: O(n).
- Iterating and adding elements according to `arr2`: O(m).
- Sorting the remaining elements: O(k log k).
- Total: O(n + k log k) where `n` is the length of `arr1` and `k` is the number of remaining elements not in `arr2`.

This solution is efficient and adheres to the constraints provided.
