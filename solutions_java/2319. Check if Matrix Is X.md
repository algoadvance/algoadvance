[Leetcode 2319. Check if Matrix Is X full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2319)
## Problem Statement
You are given a 2D integer array `grid` of size `n x n` representing a square matrix. An X-Matrix is a matrix where all the elements in the diagonals of the matrix are non-zero and all other elements are 0. 

Given this definition, an element `grid[i][j]` is part of the diagonals if either:
- `i == j` (it is on the primary diagonal),
- `i + j == n - 1` (it is on the secondary diagonal).

Return `true` if `grid` is an X-Matrix. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: grid = [[2,0,0,1],[0,3,1,0],[0,5,2,0],[4,0,0,2]]
Output: true
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: grid = [[5,7,0],[0,3,1],[0,5,0]]
Output: false
Explanation: One of the elements in the diagonals is zero.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the size of the matrix grid?**
    - The input matrix is square and of size n x n.
2. **What kind of values does the matrix contain?**
    - The matrix contains integer values, which can be positive, negative, or zero.
3. **Is there a constraint on the value of n?**
    - Typical constraints from LeetCode problems will ensure that `1 <= n <= 100`.

## Strategy
1. Traverse the matrix and check each element.
2. For each element `grid[i][j]`:
   - If it is on the primary or secondary diagonal (`i == j` or `i + j == n - 1`), it should be non-zero.
   - If it is not on either diagonal, it should be zero.
3. If all elements meet the requirements, the matrix is an X-Matrix; otherwise, it is not.

## Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean checkXMatrix(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i == j || i + j == n - 1) {
                    // Element is on the diagonal
                    if (grid[i][j] == 0) {
                        return false;
                    }
                } else {
                    // Element is not on the diagonal
                    if (grid[i][j] != 0) {
                        return false;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2) - We need to iterate through all the elements of the matrix exactly once to perform the checks.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - We are using a constant amount of extra space.

This approach should efficiently determine if the matrix `grid` is an X-Matrix based on the defined criteria.
