[Leetcode 220. Contains Duplicate III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l220)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and two integers `k` and `t`, return `true` if there are two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the array such that `abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= t` and `abs(i - j) <= k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What should be returned if no such indices `i` and `j` exist?
   - **A:** Return `false`.
   
2. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the values of `k` and `t`?
   - **A:** Yes, `k` and `t` are non-negative integers.

3. **Q:** Can `nums` be empty or contain only one element?
   - **A:** If `nums` has less than 2 elements, we should return `false` since there can't be two distinct indices.

### Strategy

To find the solution efficiently, we can use a sliding window approach combined with a data structure that allows for efficient range queries. Here, the `TreeSet` in Java (which is part of the `java.util` package) provides the necessary operations:
- `floor()` and `ceiling()` methods allow us to find the nearest values around the current number, which can be used to check the condition `abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= t`.

**Algorithm**:
1. Use a `TreeSet` to maintain a sliding window of numbers of size `k`.
2. For each element in `nums`:
   - Use `floor()` to find the largest number less than or equal to `nums[i]`.
   - Use `ceiling()` to find the smallest number greater than or equal to `nums[i]`.
   - Check if any of these numbers meet the condition `abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= t`.
   - Maintain the sliding window by adding the current number to the `TreeSet` and removing the element outside the window (i.e., `i - k`).

This approach ensures that we can find the solution within O(n log k) time complexity due to the logarithmic time complexity of the insertion and deletion operations in the `TreeSet`.

### Code

```java
import java.util.TreeSet;

public class ContainsDuplicateIII {
    public boolean containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(int[] nums, int k, int t) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length < 2 || k < 1 || t < 0) {
            return false;
        }

        TreeSet<Long> window = new TreeSet<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            Long num = (long) nums[i];
            
            Long floor = window.floor(num);
            if (floor != null && num - floor <= t) {
                return true;
            }
            
            Long ceiling = window.ceiling(num);
            if (ceiling != null && ceiling - num <= t) {
                return true;
            }
            
            window.add(num);
            
            if (i >= k) {
                window.remove((long)nums[i - k]);
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ContainsDuplicateIII obj = new ContainsDuplicateIII();
        int[] nums = {1, 5, 9, 1, 5, 9};
        int k = 2;
        int t = 3;
        System.out.println(obj.containsNearbyAlmostDuplicate(nums, k, t)); // Expected: false
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Insertion and Deletion in TreeSet**: `O(log k)`
- **Overall Complexity**: `O(n log k)`

This ensures that the implementation is efficient and works well even for larger inputs.
