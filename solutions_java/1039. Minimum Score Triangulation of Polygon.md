[Leetcode 1039. Minimum Score Triangulation of Polygon](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1039)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `values` where `values[i]` is the value of the i-th vertex of a polygon with `n` vertices indexed from `0` to `n-1. You are tasked to compute the minimum score of triangulation of the polygon. The score of a triangulation is the sum of the scores of all triangles in the triangulation. The score of a triangle is the product of the values of its vertices. Return the minimum score of the triangulation of the polygon.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the minimum number of vertices?**
   The minimum number of vertices in the polygon will be 3.

2. **Are all vertex values positive integers?**
   Yes, for simplicity, assume all vertex values are positive integers.

3. **Are the vertices ordered in any specific manner?**
   Yes, the vertices are ordered in a clockwise manner in the array.

### Strategy

We'll use dynamic programming to solve this problem. The idea is to use a DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum score to triangulate the polygon from vertex `i` to vertex `j`.

#### Steps:

1. Initialize a `dp` array of size `n x n` with all zero values.
2. Use a nested loop to iterate over the possible lengths of the polygon's subarrays.
3. For each subarray, use another loop to try every possible vertex `k` as a connection point that divides the current sub-polygon into two smaller sub-polygons.
4. Calculate the score of forming a triangle among vertices `i, j, k` and add to the scores of the two smaller sub-triangulations.
5. Keep track of the minimum score for each sub-polygon.

### Dynamic Programming Transition

For each `i, j, k`:
\[ dp[i][j] = \min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + \text{values}[i] \times \text{values}[j] \times \text{values}[k]) \]

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minScoreTriangulation(int[] values) {
        int n = values.length;
        // Initialize DP array
        int[][] dp = new int[n][n];

        // Fill the DP array
        for (int len = 2; len < n; len++) { // len is the distance between i and j
            for (int i = 0; i + len < n; i++) {
                int j = i + len;
                dp[i][j] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
                for (int k = i + 1; k < j; k++) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + values[i] * values[j] * values[k]);
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[0][n - 1];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^3)\) because we have three nested loops, each iterating up to `n` times in the worst case.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\) because we use an `n x n` table to store the results of subproblems.

This approach ensures that the problem is solved efficiently using dynamic programming, storing intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations.
