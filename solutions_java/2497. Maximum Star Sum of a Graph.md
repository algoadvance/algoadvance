[Leetcode 2497. Maximum Star Sum of a Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2497)
### Problem Statement

You are given an undirected graph represented as a number of nodes, an array of edges, and an array of values. 

- Each node `i` has a value denoted by `values[i]`.
- You need to determine the maximum "star sum" for any node.

A "star sum" of a node is defined as the sum of the values of the node itself and the k highest values among its neighbors. Here, k is a given parameter.

Write a function `maximumStarSum` that takes the following parameters:

- `int n` - Number of nodes.
- `int[][] edges` - 2D array where each `edges[i] = [u, v]` denotes an edge between nodes `u` and `v`.
- `int[] values` - Array of integers where `values[i]` is the value of the node `i`.
- `int k` - The maximum number of highest value neighbors to be included in the star sum.

The function should return an integer representing the maximum star sum that can be obtained.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Edge Cases:**
   - Can k be larger than the number of nodes minus one?
   - What should we do if k is zero?

2. **Graph Assumptions:**
   - Are there any duplicate edges or self-loops?
   - Is the graph always connected?

3. **Data Constraints:**
   - The maximum value for n, edges[], and values[]?

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the graph.
   
2. **Calculate Star Sum:**
   - For each node, consider its value.
   - Sort the values of its neighbors and pick the top k neighbors.
   - Calculate the star sum and keep track of the maximum star sum encountered.

3. **Optimization:**
    - Use max-heap to efficiently get the k largest values of neighbors, instead of sorting.

### Time Complexity
- Building the adjacency list: O(E) where E is the number of edges.
- Extracting the top k values for each node: O(N + E log k).
- Overall time complexity: O(N + E log k).
  
### Java Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MaximumStarSum {

    public static int maximumStarSum(int n, int[][] edges, int[] values, int k) {
        // Edge case when k is zero
        if (k == 0) {
            return Arrays.stream(values).max().orElse(0);
        }

        // Initialize adjacency list
        List<List<Integer>> adjacencyList = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            adjacencyList.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }

        // Build the graph
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            adjacencyList.get(u).add(v);
            adjacencyList.get(v).add(u);
        }

        int maxStarSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        // Calculate star sums
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
            for (int neighbor : adjacencyList.get(i)) {
                maxHeap.add(values[neighbor]);
            }

            int starSum = values[i];
            for (int j = 0; j < k && !maxHeap.isEmpty(); j++) {
                starSum += maxHeap.poll();
            }

            maxStarSum = Math.max(maxStarSum, starSum);
        }

        return maxStarSum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 5;
        int[][] edges = // use example above
        int[] values = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50};
        int k = 2;
        System.out.println(maximumStarSum(n, edges, values, k)); // Output should be 90
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- **Graph Construction:** We build an adjacency list to represent the graph.
- **Priority Queue (Max-Heap):** For each node, we use a max-heap to get the k largest values from its neighbors.
- **Star Sum Calculation:** Calculate the star sum for each node and update the maximum star sum accordingly.
- **Edge Cases Handling:** The code handles scenarios where k is zero by returning the maximum value of the nodes.

### Time Complexity:
- **Adjacency List Building:** O(E)
- **Heap Operations:** O(N + E log k)
- **Total Complexity:** O(N + E log k)
