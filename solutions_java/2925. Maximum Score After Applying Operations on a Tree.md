[Leetcode 2925. Maximum Score After Applying Operations on a Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2925)
## Problem Statement

You are given an undirected tree consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, and `n - 1` edges. The root of the tree is the node `0`. Each node has a value associated with it, given in the array `values[]`.

You need to perform exactly `k` operations on the tree. In each operation, you can choose any leaf node and remove it from the tree along with its edge.

Your task is to maximize the sum of the values of the leaf nodes removed during these `k` operations.

**Constraints:**
1. `1 <= n <= 10^5`
2. `1 <= k <= n`
3. `1 <= values[i] <= 10^9`

## Clarifying Questions

To fully understand the problem's requirements, consider asking these clarifying questions:

1. Can the root node (`0`) be considered a leaf if all of its children are removed, or is it always excluded?
   - Typically, the root can become a leaf if all its children are removed.
     
2. Is it possible that we perform fewer than `k` operations if there are not enough leaf nodes left to remove?
   - According to the problem statement, we must perform exactly `k` operations.

3. Does removing a leaf node possibly change what other nodes are considered leaves?
   - Yes, once a leaf node is removed, its parent could potentially become a new leaf.

## Strategy

Here's a high-level strategy to solve this problem:

1. **Identify Leaves**: First, identify all the leaf nodes in the tree.
2. **Max-Heap for Leaf Values**: Use a max-heap (priority queue) to keep track of the values of the leaf nodes.
3. **Dynamic Leaf Management**: As we remove leaf nodes in each of the `k` operations, dynamically adjust and identify new leaves.
4. **Sum Collectio**: Maintain a running total of the sum of values from the removed leaf nodes.

A depth-first search (DFS) can be used to identify the initial set of leaves.

## Code

Below is the Java implementation to solve the problem:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MaximumScoreAfterOperations {
    static class Pair {
        int value;
        int node;
        Pair(int value, int node) {
            this.value = value;
            this.node = node;
        }
    }
    
    public int maxScoreAfterKOperations(int[] values, int[][] edges, int k) {
        int n = values.length;
        List<Integer>[] tree = new ArrayList[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            tree[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        int[] degree = new int[n];
        
        // Create the tree
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0], v = edge[1];
            tree[u].add(v);
            tree[v].add(u);
            degree[u]++;
            degree[v]++;
        }
        
        // Priority queue to store leaves based on their value in descending order
        PriorityQueue<Pair> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b.value - a.value);
        Queue<Integer> leafQueue = new LinkedList<>();
        
        // Find initial leaves
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (degree[i] == 1) {
                leafQueue.offer(i);
                maxHeap.offer(new Pair(values[i], i));
            }
        }
        
        int totalScore = 0;
        int[] visited = new int[n];
        while (k > 0 && !maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
            Pair maxLeaf = maxHeap.poll();
            // Check if node is removed in previous operations
            if (visited[maxLeaf.node] == 1) continue;
            totalScore += maxLeaf.value;
            k--;
            // Remove this leaf and update the tree
            visited[maxLeaf.node] = 1;
            for (int parent : tree[maxLeaf.node]) {
                if (--degree[parent] == 1) {
                    maxHeap.offer(new Pair(values[parent], parent));
                }
            }
        }
        
        return totalScore;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The solution involves:
1. Initializing and building the adjacency list for the tree: `O(n)`.
2. Identifying the leaves and processing via the max-heap: `O(n log n)` due to heap operations.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`, which should be efficient given the problem constraints.
