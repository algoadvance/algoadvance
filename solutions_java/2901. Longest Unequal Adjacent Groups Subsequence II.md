[Leetcode 2901. Longest Unequal Adjacent Groups Subsequence II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2901)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, you are tasked with finding the length of the longest subsequence where no two adjacent groups of the same character are equal. A group is defined as a consecutive sequence of the same character.

For example, in the string "aabbcc", the groups are {"aa", "bb", "cc"}. You need to find the longest subsequence, such as "abc".

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
   - Are there any specific characters that can appear in the string or it's any lowercase English alphabet?

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - If there are multiple subsequences with the maximum possible length, should we return any one of them or just the length?

For now, let's assume that the maximum length of the input string `s` is reasonable, say up to 10^5 characters, and the string consists of lowercase English letters.

## Strategy

1. **Identify Groups:**
   - Traverse the string to identify all the groups of consecutive characters. 

2. **Construct Subsequence:**
   - From the identified groups, construct a new sequence by taking only one character from each group. This guarantees that no two adjacent groups in the new sequence are equal.

3. **Calculate Length:**
   - Simply return the length of this new sequence.

## Code

Here is the Java implementation of the described strategy:

```java
public class LongestUnequalAdjacentGroupsSubsequence {
    public int longestUnequalAdjacentGroupsSubsequence(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.length() == 0) return 0;
        
        // The length of string "s"
        int n = s.length();
        
        // Initialize to track the result length
        int resultLength = 0;

        // Traverse through the string to find groups and count the number of groups
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ) {
            char currentChar = s.charAt(i);
            resultLength++;  // Each group contributes one character to the final sequence
            
            // Skip over the entire group of the same character
            while (i < n && s.charAt(i) == currentChar) {
                i++;
            }
        }

        // Return the length of the longest subsequence with unequal adjacent groups
        return resultLength;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LongestUnequalAdjacentGroupsSubsequence leags = new LongestUnequalAdjacentGroupsSubsequence();
        System.out.println(leags.longestUnequalAdjacentGroupsSubsequence("aabbcc"));    // Output: 3
        System.out.println(leags.longestUnequalAdjacentGroupsSubsequence("abcd"));      // Output: 4
        System.out.println(leags.longestUnequalAdjacentGroupsSubsequence("aaabbaa"));   // Output: 3
        System.out.println(leags.longestUnequalAdjacentGroupsSubsequence(""));          // Output: 0
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**
  - The algorithm traverses the string once, making the time complexity \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since it uses only a few extra variables for counting and tracking the length of the result, regardless of the input size.

This ensures the solution is efficient and suitable for large strings up to the assumed limit of 10^5 characters.
