[Leetcode 2385. Amount of Time for Binary Tree to Be Infected](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2385)
### Problem Statement
You are given the root of a binary tree and a node `start`, located somewhere in the tree. The `start` node gets infected by a virus at time 0. During each minute, every node that is adjacent to an infected node will become infected. Return the amount of time for the entire binary tree to be infected.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the input format?**
   - The input is the root of a binary tree and a reference to a node in the tree that is the start node.

2. **What is the output?**
   - The time in minutes for the entire tree to be infected.

3. **Is the binary tree always a valid input?**
   - Yes, assume that the binary tree is always well-formed.

4. **Can the tree contain cycles?**
   - No, binary trees do not contain cycles by definition.

### Strategy
1. **Convert the Tree to an Undirected Graph:**
   - Use DFS/BFS to traverse the tree and construct an adjacency list representing the graph.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) from the Start Node:**
   - Perform BFS starting from the `start` node to simulate the infection process. Track the time taken to infect all nodes.
   - Use a queue to facilitate BFS and a set to track visited nodes.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

public class Solution {
    public int amountOfTime(TreeNode root, int start) {
        // Step 1: Build the adjacency list representation of the tree
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph = new HashMap<>();
        buildGraph(root, null, graph);
        
        // Step 2: Perform BFS from the start node
        return bfsTimeToInfect(graph, start);
    }

    private void buildGraph(TreeNode node, TreeNode parent, Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph) {
        if (node == null) return;
        
        graph.putIfAbsent(node.val, new ArrayList<>());
        
        if (parent != null) {
            graph.get(node.val).add(parent.val);
            graph.get(parent.val).add(node.val);
        }
        
        buildGraph(node.left, node, graph);
        buildGraph(node.right, node, graph);
    }

    private int bfsTimeToInfect(Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph, int start) {
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        Set<Integer> visited = new HashSet<>();
        queue.offer(start);
        visited.add(start);
        
        int time = -1; // To account for the first infection at minute 0 end loop starts from -1
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int size = queue.size();
            time++;
            
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                int node = queue.poll();
                for (int neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
                    if (!visited.contains(neighbor)) {
                        queue.offer(neighbor);
                        visited.add(neighbor);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return time;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Graph Construction:**
   - Each node is visited once, and each edge is considered once.
   - Time complexity: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the tree.

2. **BFS Traversal:**
   - Each node is visited once, and each edge is considered once.
   - Time complexity: \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the tree.

Therefore, the overall time complexity for the solution is \(O(N)\).
