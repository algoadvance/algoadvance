[Leetcode 3218. Minimum Cost for Cutting Cake I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3218)
## Problem Statement

You are given a rectangular cake, where some horizontal and vertical cuts are to be made. You are also given two arrays of integers `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts` where:

- `horizontalCuts[i]` represents the distance from the top of the cake to the i-th horizontal cut.
- `verticalCuts[i]` represents the distance from the left of the cake to the i-th vertical cut.

After all cuts have been made, you want to find the maximum area of a piece of cake that can be obtained. The area of a piece of cake is the product of its width and height.

Write a function to return the maximum area of a piece of cake after you have completed the cuts. Since the answer can be a large number, return this modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: h = 5, w = 4, horizontalCuts = [1,2,4], verticalCuts = [1,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: The figure above represents the given rectangular cake. The maximum area of a piece of cake after you cut at all the horizontal and vertical positions is 4.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: h = 5, w = 4, horizontalCuts = [3,1], verticalCuts = [1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The figure above represents the given rectangular cake. The maximum area of a piece of cake after you cut at all the horizontal and vertical positions is 6.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: h = 5, w = 4, horizontalCuts = [3], verticalCuts = [3]
Output: 9
```

Constraints:
- `2 <= h, w <= 10^9`
- `1 <= horizontalCuts.length <= min(h - 1, 10^5)`
- `1 <= verticalCuts.length <= min(w - 1, 10^5)`
- `1 <= horizontalCuts[i] < h`
- `1 <= verticalCuts[i] < w`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the cuts be out of order?
   - Yes, the cuts in both `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts` arrays may not be sorted.
2. Are the horizontal and vertical cuts inclusive of the edges of the cake?
   - The cuts are exclusive of the edges of the cake. Cuts are made within the cake.
3. Can there be multiple same cuts?
   - No, all cuts in each array are unique.

## Strategy

To solve the problem efficiently:

1. **Sort the Arrays**:
   - Sort both `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts` arrays to easily calculate the maximum differences.
2. **Calculate Maximum Gaps**:
   - Calculate the maximum gap between consecutive horizontal cuts.
   - Calculate the maximum gap between consecutive vertical cuts.
3. **Include Edges**:
   - Consider the initial and final edges of the cake in both dimensions as potential maximum gaps.
4. **Calculate Area**:
   - The maximum area piece of cake will be the product of the maximum differences in horizontal and vertical cuts.
5. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Return the result modulo `10^9 + 7` to prevent overflow.

## Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int h, int w, int[] horizontalCuts, int[] verticalCuts) {
        int MOD = 1_000_000_007;

        // Sort the cuts arrays
        Arrays.sort(horizontalCuts);
        Arrays.sort(verticalCuts);

        // Calculate the maximum gap between consecutive horizontal cuts
        int maxHGap = Math.max(horizontalCuts[0], h - horizontalCuts[horizontalCuts.length - 1]);
        for (int i = 1; i < horizontalCuts.length; i++) {
            maxHGap = Math.max(maxHGap, horizontalCuts[i] - horizontalCuts[i - 1]);
        }

        // Calculate the maximum gap between consecutive vertical cuts
        int maxVGap = Math.max(verticalCuts[0], w - verticalCuts[verticalCuts.length - 1]);
        for (int i = 1; i < verticalCuts.length; i++) {
            maxVGap = Math.max(maxVGap, verticalCuts[i] - verticalCuts[i - 1]);
        }

        // Calculate the maximum area piece of cake
        long maxArea = (long) maxHGap * maxVGap;
        return (int) (maxArea % MOD);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();

        // Test cases
        System.out.println(solution.maxArea(5, 4, new int[]{1, 2, 4}, new int[]{1, 3})); // Output: 4
        System.out.println(solution.maxArea(5, 4, new int[]{3, 1}, new int[]{1})); // Output: 6
        System.out.println(solution.maxArea(5, 4, new int[]{3}, new int[]{3})); // Output: 9
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- Sorting both `horizontalCuts` and `verticalCuts` takes `O(n log n)` where `n` is the length of the arrays.
- Calculating the maximum gaps takes `O(n)`.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.

This solution ensures that we efficiently compute the maximum area of a piece of cake taking into consideration all provided cuts.
