[Leetcode 1974. Minimum Time to Type Word Using Special Typewriter](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1974)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `word` consisting of lowercase English letters. In one second, you can perform one of the following operations:

- Move the pointer to the adjacent character (to the left or right).
- Type the character under the pointer.

The pointer initially points to the character 'a'. Each time a character needs to be typed from `word`, you need to move the pointer based on the shortest path (clockwise or counterclockwise) to that character.

Return the **minimum number of seconds** to type out the entire word.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the typewriter circular?** 
   Yes, the typewriter is circular, meaning after 'z' it wraps around back to 'a' and vice versa.

2. **Can the same key be typed more than once?** 
   Yes, each character in the `word` needs to be typed in order, regardless of repetitions.

3. **What is the length of the string `word`?**
   The string `word` can be up to 100 characters long.

## Strategy

1. **Initialize** the pointer at 'a'.
2. **Iterate** over each character of the `word`.
3. **Calculate** the clockwise and counterclockwise distances from the current position to the target character.
4. **Choose** the minimum distance to type the character.
5. **Add** this minimum distance and 1 (for typing the character) to the total time.
6. **Update** the current position to the new character after typing.

## Code

```java
public class MinimumTimeToTypeWord {
    public int minTimeToType(String word) {
        int totalTime = 0;
        char current = 'a';
        
        for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
            int clockwiseDist = Math.abs(c - current);
            int counterClockwiseDist = 26 - clockwiseDist;
            totalTime += Math.min(clockwiseDist, counterClockwiseDist) + 1;
            current = c;
        }
        
        return totalTime;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumTimeToTypeWord obj = new MinimumTimeToTypeWord();
        String word = "cba";
        System.out.println("Minimum time to type \"" + word + "\": " + obj.minTimeToType(word));
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `word`. This is because we are iterating through each character of the string exactly once.

## Explanation

1. We initialize `totalTime` to 0 and start at the character 'a'.
2. For each character in the `word`, we calculate two distances:
   - **Clockwise distance**: `Math.abs(c - current)`
   - **Counter-clockwise distance**: `26 - clockwiseDistance`
3. We add the minimum of the two distances plus 1 (for typing the character) to the `totalTime`.
4. We update the current position to the new character after typing it.

This approach ensures that we use the minimum time to move between characters and include the time to type each character.
