[Leetcode 2195. Append K Integers With Minimal Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2195)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. The array `nums` contains unique positive integers, and `k` is also a positive integer.

You need to append `k` unique positive integers that are not present in `nums` such that the sum of the `k` appended integers is minimized.

Return the sum of the `k` integers that you append.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of input values**:
    - What is the maximum length of the `nums` array?
    - What is the range of values for elements in `nums` and for `k`?

2. **Uniqueness of values**:
    - Since the `nums` array contains unique positive integers, I assume no value repeats in it.
    - Can `k` be larger than any predefined length?

3. **Output requirements**:
    - Should the result be just the sum of the k integers, or do we need to output the actual integers as well?

For this problem, based on typical competitive programming constraints, let's assume:
- `nums.length ≤ 10^5`.
- `1 ≤ nums[i], k ≤ 10^9`.

### Strategy
1. **Sorting**: Sort the `nums` array.
2. **Iterating and checking**: Iterate through the natural numbers starting from 1, skipping the numbers present in `nums`, and pick the first `k` numbers not in `nums`.
3. **Sum Calculation**: Calculate the sum of the picked numbers.

### Detailed Steps:
1. First, sort the `nums` array.
2. Initialize a set from `nums` for O(1) look-up time.
3. Use a loop to find the smallest `k` natural numbers not in `nums`.
4. Add the found numbers and compute their sum.

### Code Implementation
```java
import java.util.*;

public class AppendKIntegersWithMinimalSum {
    public long minimalKSum(int[] nums, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        Set<Integer> numSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            numSet.add(num);
        }
        
        long sum = 0;
        int appendedCount = 0;
        int currentNum = 1;
        
        while (appendedCount < k) {
            if (!numSet.contains(currentNum)) {
                sum += currentNum;
                appendedCount++;
            }
            currentNum++;
        }
        
        return sum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {1, 4, 25, 10, 5, 6};
        int k = 2;
        AppendKIntegersWithMinimalSum sol = new AppendKIntegersWithMinimalSum();
        System.out.println(sol.minimalKSum(nums, k)); // Expected: 2 + 3 = 5
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: O(n log n), where `n` is the length of `nums`.
- **Set operations**: O(n) for creating the set.
- **Appending and sum calculation**: O(k), since we potentially check up to `k` natural numbers not in `nums`.

The overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, hence **O(n log n)**.

This approach efficiently collects the smallest `k` numbers not present in `nums`, ensuring the sum is minimized.
