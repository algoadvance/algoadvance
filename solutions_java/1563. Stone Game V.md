[Leetcode 1563. Stone Game V](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1563)
### Problem Statement

Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several stones arranged in a row, and each stone has an associated value which is represented by an array `stoneValue`.

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each player's turn, they can split the row of stones into two non-empty parts (left and right), and only take the stones from one of the parts, with the other part being given to the other player. The player who takes the stones will reduce their score by the sum of the stones in that part. Players alternate turns until all stones are taken.

Both players will play optimally to maximize their score difference. You need to return the maximum score difference Alice can achieve over Bob.

**Example:**

- `Input: stoneValue = [6,2,3,4,5,5]`
- `Output: 18`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**: What is the possible range of length for the `stoneValue` array?
   - **Response**: The length of `stoneValue` can go up to 500.

2. **Values in `stoneValue`**: Are the values in the array always positive integers?
   - **Response**: Yes, they are positive integers.

3. **Optimal Play**: Both players play optimally, aiming to maximize their score difference. Correct?
   - **Response**: Yes, both aim to maximize their score difference.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can adopt a dynamic programming approach. We can define a `dp` table where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum score difference Alice can achieve over Bob from the subarray `stoneValue[i ... j]`.

Steps to approach:
1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: Calculate the prefix sums for the `stoneValue` array to quickly compute sum of any subarray.
2. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: Define a DP array `dp[i][j]`.
3. **Iterating through subarrays**: For each subarray from length 2 to `n`, calculate the possible splits and decide the best split for Alice.
4. **Maximizing Score Difference**: At each split, calculate the score difference when Alice picks left part and when Alice picks right part.
5. **Update DP Table**: Store the maximum score difference found in the `dp` table.

### Code

```java
public class StoneGameV {
    public int stoneGameV(int[] stoneValue) {
        int n = stoneValue.length;
        int[] prefixSum = new int[n + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            prefixSum[i + 1] = prefixSum[i] + stoneValue[i];
        }

        int[][] dp = new int[n][n];

        for (int len = 2; len <= n; len++) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - len; i++) {
                int j = i + len - 1;
                for (int k = i; k < j; k++) {
                    int leftSum = prefixSum[k + 1] - prefixSum[i];
                    int rightSum = prefixSum[j + 1] - prefixSum[k + 1];
                    if (leftSum < rightSum) {
                        dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], leftSum + dp[i][k]);
                    } else if (leftSum > rightSum) {
                        dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], rightSum + dp[k + 1][j]);
                    } else {
                        dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], leftSum + Math.max(dp[i][k], dp[k + 1][j]));
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[0][n - 1];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StoneGameV solution = new StoneGameV();
        int[] stoneValue = {6, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5};
        System.out.println(solution.stoneGameV(stoneValue));  // Output: 18
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Prefix Sum Calculation**: \(O(n)\)
- **Dynamic Programming Table Fill**: The nested loops fill the DP table, which results in \(O(n^3)\) time complexity because for each subarray \(i, j\), we iterate over possible split points `k`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n^3)\). Given that \(n \leq 500\), this should be efficient enough for this problem size.
