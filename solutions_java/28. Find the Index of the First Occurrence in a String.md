## Problem Statement

LeetCode 28: Find the Index of the First Occurrence in a String

Given two strings `needle` and `haystack`, return the index of the first occurrence of `needle` in `haystack`, or `-1` if `needle` is not part of `haystack`.

**Example 1:**
- Input: `haystack = "sadbutsad"`, `needle = "sad"`
- Output: `0`
- Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6. The first occurrence is at index 0.

**Example 2:**
- Input: `haystack = "leetcode"`, `needle = "leeto"`
- Output: `-1`
- Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode".

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can `needle` be an empty string? 
   - According to the problem, `needle` will always be a non-empty string.
2. What should be returned if `haystack` is an empty string but `needle` is not?
   - Return `-1`.

## Strategy

We'll use a sliding window approach to solve this problem:
1. If the length of `needle` is greater than the length of `haystack`, return `-1`.
2. Iterate over `haystack` from the start to a point where the remaining substring length is at least the length of `needle`.
3. In each iteration, extract a substring from `haystack` of the same length as `needle` and compare it with `needle`.
4. If they are equal, return the starting index of that substring.
5. If no match is found after the loop, return `-1`.

This approach ensures that we check each possible substring exactly once, resulting in an efficient runtime.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int strStr(String haystack, String needle) {
        int haystackLength = haystack.length();
        int needleLength = needle.length();
        
        if (needleLength > haystackLength) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        // Slide over the 'haystack' string
        for (int i = 0; i <= haystackLength - needleLength; i++) {
            // Check if the substring starting at i matches needle
            if (haystack.substring(i, i + needleLength).equals(needle)) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \( O((n - m + 1) \cdot m) \), where \( n \) is the length of `haystack` and \( m \) is the length of `needle`. This is because in the worst-case scenario, we compare the substring of length `m` with `needle` \( (n - m + 1) \) times. 

- Extracting a substring and comparing it takes \( O(m) \) time.
- Iterating through the `haystack` up to \( (n - m + 1) \) times results in \( O(n - m + 1) \) iterations.

So, multiplying these operations we get the overall time complexity as \( O((n - m + 1) \cdot m) \).
