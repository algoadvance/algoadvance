[Leetcode 993. Cousins in Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l993)
Sure, let's go through this problem step-by-step.

### Problem Statement:
In a binary tree, the root node is at depth 0, and children of each depth `k` node are at depth `k+1`.

Two nodes of a binary tree are **cousins** if they have the same depth but have different parents.

Given the root of a binary tree with unique values and the values `x` and `y` of two different nodes in the tree, return `true` if and only if the nodes corresponding to the values `x` and `y` are cousins.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can the values `x` and `y` be equal?**
   - No, the problem states they are two different nodes.
2. **What should we return if either `x` or `y` is not found in the tree?**
   - We should return `false`.
3. **Is it guaranteed that `x` and `y` exist in the tree?**
   - No, if either doesnâ€™t exist, they can't be cousins, and we should return `false`.

### Strategy:
1. Perform a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse the tree level-by-level.
2. Keep track of each node's parent and depth.
3. Once we find both nodes `x` and `y`, we check their depths and parents to decide if they are cousins.

### Code:
```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

public class Solution {
    public boolean isCousins(TreeNode root, int x, int y) {
        if (root == null) {
            return false;
        }

        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(root);

        TreeNode xParent = null, yParent = null;
        int xDepth = -1, yDepth = -1;
        int depth = 0;

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int size = queue.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                TreeNode node = queue.poll();

                if (node.left != null) {
                    queue.offer(node.left);
                    if (node.left.val == x) {
                        xParent = node;
                        xDepth = depth + 1;
                    } else if (node.left.val == y) {
                        yParent = node;
                        yDepth = depth + 1;
                    }
                }

                if (node.right != null) {
                    queue.offer(node.right);
                    if (node.right.val == x) {
                        xParent = node;
                        xDepth = depth + 1;
                    } else if (node.right.val == y) {
                        yParent = node;
                        yDepth = depth + 1;
                    }
                }
            }
            depth++;
        }

        // Check if x and y are cousins
        return xDepth == yDepth && xParent != yParent;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: We traverse each node exactly once, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(n)**: We use a queue to store the nodes for BFS traversal, which in the worst case will store all node at the leaf level, approximately `n/2` nodes.
