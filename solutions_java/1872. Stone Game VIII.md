[Leetcode 1872. Stone Game VIII](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1872)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `stones` where `stones[i]` represents the value of the `i-th` stone from left to right. A player can remove the leftmost stone and the remaining stones will come closer together. The game is played by two players (Alice and Bob) who take turns, with Alice going first. The score at any point in the game is the sum of the removed stones. The objective of each player is to maximize their score minus the opponent's score.

Return the maximum score difference Alice can achieve if both players play optimally.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the size of the array `stones`?**
   - The length of `stones` can be up to `10^5`.

2. **Can the value of a stone be negative?**
   - Yes, the values in `stones` array can be both positive and negative.

3. **What is the minimum number of stones that must be in the array?**
   - The minimum number of stones in the array is 2.

4. **Do both players always play optimally?**
   - Yes, both Alice and Bob will play optimally.

### Strategy

1. **Prefix Sums**: First, calculate the prefix sums of the stones array which gives the sum of the first `i` stones.

2. **Dynamic Programming**: We need a dynamic programming array to store the maximum score difference Alice can achieve starting from position `i`. This will be a backward calculation because knowing the state of the game from the end allows us to deduce the earlier states.

3. **Optimization**: Given that Alice always starts first, we initialize the calculation from the second last stone and update the DP states backwards to the start. 

4. **Score Calculation**: For each stone from the beginning, calculate the difference between the sum of `i` stones and the optimal future state derived from DP.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int stoneGameVIII(int[] stones) {
        int n = stones.length;
        // Calculate prefix sums
        int[] prefixSum = new int[n];
        prefixSum[0] = stones[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i - 1] + stones[i];
        }
        
        // DP array to store the optimal difference
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        
        // Initial condition: when only the last stone remains
        dp[n - 1] = prefixSum[n - 1];
        
        // Work backwards to fill the dp array
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 1; i--) {
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i + 1], prefixSum[i] - dp[i + 1]);
        }
        
        // Result is the optimal difference starting from the 2nd stone
        return dp[1];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Prefix Sum Calculation**: 
  - Takes `O(n)` time because we are iterating through the stones array once.
  
- **DP Array Filling**:
  - Also takes `O(n)` time because we are updating the array based on previous calculations.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.

This approach ensures we efficiently determine the optimal strategy for Alice and compute the maximum possible score difference.
