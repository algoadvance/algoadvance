[Leetcode 3005. Count Elements With Maximum Frequency](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3005)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return the count of the elements in the array that have the maximum frequency.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format**: 
    - What is the range of number values in `nums`? Are there negative numbers?
    - What is the length range of `nums`?
  
    **Example**:
    ```java
    Input: nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
    Output: 1
    ```
    - Explanation: The number `3` has the highest frequency (3 times).

2. **Constraints**:
    - Can the array be empty?
    - Should we consider large input sizes for performance tuning?

## Strategy

1. **Step 1**: Traverse the array and keep a frequency count of each element using a `HashMap`.
2. **Step 2**: Determine the maximum frequency from the frequency map.
3. **Step 3**: Count how many elements have this maximum frequency.
4. **Step 4**: Return this count.

### Code Implementation

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class MaximumFrequencyCounter {

    public static int countElementsWithMaxFrequency(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
            return 0; // Edge case for empty array input
        }

        HashMap<Integer, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();

        // Step 1: Count frequency of each element
        for (int num : nums) {
            frequencyMap.put(num, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }

        // Step 2: Find the maximum frequency
        int maxFrequency = 0;
        for (int freq : frequencyMap.values()) {
            if (freq > maxFrequency) {
                maxFrequency = freq;
            }
        }

        // Step 3: Count how many elements have the max frequency
        int count = 0;
        for (int freq : frequencyMap.values()) {
            if (freq == maxFrequency) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        // Step 4: Return the count
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums1 = {1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3};
        System.out.println(countElementsWithMaxFrequency(nums1)); // Output: 1

        int[] nums2 = {1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3};
        System.out.println(countElementsWithMaxFrequency(nums2)); // Output: 3

        int[] nums3 = {};
        System.out.println(countElementsWithMaxFrequency(nums3)); // Output: 0
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Step 1**: The traversal of the array to build the frequency map takes O(N), where N is the length of the array.
- **Step 2**: Traversal of the frequency map to find the maximum frequency is O(M), where M is the number of unique elements in the array.
- **Step 3**: Another traversal of the frequency map to count elements with max frequency is also O(M).
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(N + M)**, which simplifies to **O(N)** since N will dominate if there are many duplicates. 

This approach efficiently solves the problem within linear time complexity relative to the input size.
