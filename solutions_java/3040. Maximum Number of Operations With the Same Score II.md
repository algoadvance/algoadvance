[Leetcode 3040. Maximum Number of Operations With the Same Score II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3040)
### Problem Statement

You are given a binary tree where each node contains an integer value. Your task is to determine the maximum number of operations with the same score. The score for an operation involving a node and its child is defined as the product of the values of the node and its child.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the values of the nodes guaranteed to be positive integers?
2. Should we count operations involving leaf nodes (nodes without children)?
3. Will the binary tree contain only unique values in nodes, or can values be repeated?

### Code

```java
// Definition for a binary tree node.
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode() {}
    TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
    TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public int maxOperationsWithSameScore(TreeNode root) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> scoreFrequency = new HashMap<>();
        traverseAndCalculateScores(root, scoreFrequency);
        
        int maxCount = 0;
        for (int count : scoreFrequency.values()) {
            maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, count);
        }
        
        return maxCount;
    }

    private void traverseAndCalculateScores(TreeNode node, HashMap<Integer, Integer> scoreFrequency) {
        if (node == null) {
            return;
        }
        if (node.left != null) {
            int leftScore = node.val * node.left.val;
            scoreFrequency.put(leftScore, scoreFrequency.getOrDefault(leftScore, 0) + 1);
        }
        if (node.right != null) {
            int rightScore = node.val * node.right.val;
            scoreFrequency.put(rightScore, scoreFrequency.getOrDefault(rightScore, 0) + 1);
        }
        traverseAndCalculateScores(node.left, scoreFrequency);
        traverseAndCalculateScores(node.right, scoreFrequency);
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. Traverse the binary tree recursively to calculate the scores for each node-child pair.
2. Use a `HashMap` to keep track of the frequency of each score.
3. During the traversal:
   - For each node, if it has a left child, compute the score for the node-left child pair and update the frequency in the `HashMap`.
   - If it has a right child, compute the score for the node-right child pair and update the frequency in the `HashMap`.
4. Finally, iterate over the `HashMap` to find the maximum frequency of any score and return it.

### Time Complexity

- **Traversal:** The traversal of the binary tree is done once, taking O(N) time, where N is the number of nodes in the tree.
- **HashMap Operations:** Each insertion and retrieval from the `HashMap` takes O(1) time on average.
- The final iteration over the `HashMap` to find the maximum frequency will take O(S) time, where S is the number of unique scores, which is at most N.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(N).
