[Leetcode 650. 2 Keys Keyboard](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l650)
### Problem Statement

You have a text editor with two special keys:

- A key (`"A"`) which appends the character 'A' to the current text.
- A key combination (`"Ctrl-V"`) which pastes the current clipboard content.

Initially, you have `n` 'A's written on the clipboard, and you can only perform two operations:

- Pressing 'A' will append another 'A' to the current text.
- Pressing Ctrl-V will paste the clipboard's content to the current text.

Given `n`, the goal is to find the minimum number of operations needed to get exactly `n` 'A's in the text.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Clarifications about the operation of the keys**:
   - The 'A' key appends a single 'A'.
   - The 'Ctrl-V' key pastes clipboard content and can only be used after a 'Ctrl-C' operation which copies the entire current text to the clipboard. 
   
2. **Initial setup**:
   - We start with exactly one 'A' in the text.

3. **Clipboard**:
   - Any 'Ctrl-C' operation copies the entire current text to the clipboard.

### Strategy

The problem boils down to dividing the task into finding the smallest number of steps required to reach `n` 'A's starting with one 'A'. This can be approached as follows:

#### Dynamic Programming Approach
Define `dp[i]` as the minimum number of operations required to get `i` 'A's. Initially, we have:
- `dp[1] = 0` since one 'A' is our starting point.

For every value of `i` from 2 to `n`:
1. Check each possible value `j` where `j` is a factor of `i` (`i % j == 0`).
2. If `j` is a factor of `i`, then paste the content (`i/j` times) requiring `i/j` operations after copying `j` length text which also requires `j` operations. Therefore, it takes `dp[j] + (i / j)` operations in total to achieve `i` copies.

#### Code

```java
public class TwoKeysKeyboard {
    public int minSteps(int n) {
        // Edge case: since 1 'A' requires 0 operations.
        if (n == 1) return 0;
        
        // Define the dp array where dp[i] will store the min operations to get i 'A's.
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        
        // Start with 0 operations needed for 1 'A' (base case)
        dp[1] = 0;
        
        // Fill dp array from 2 to n
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = i; // Start with the maximum which is all 'A' operations

            for (int j = i - 1; j > 0; j--) {
                if (i % j == 0) { // If divisible, we can copy paste from j
                    dp[i] = dp[j] + (i / j);
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TwoKeysKeyboard solution = new TwoKeysKeyboard();
        int n = 9; // Example
        System.out.println("Minimum steps to get " + n + " 'A's: " + solution.minSteps(n));
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \cdot \sqrt{n})\). The double loop runs in this complexity because checking all factors `\(j\)` of any `i` can be done up until \(\sqrt{n}\).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\). We use a linear array to store the minimum operations up to n. 

This approach is efficient and feasible for typical input sizes within constraint limits.
