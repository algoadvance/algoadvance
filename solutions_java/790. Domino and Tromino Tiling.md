[Leetcode 790. Domino and Tromino Tiling](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l790)
## Problem Statement
You have two types of tiles: a `2 x 1` domino shape and an "L" tromino shape. You may rotate these shapes.

Given an integer `n`, return the number of ways to tile a `2 x n` board with these two shapes. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 3
Output: 5
Explanation: The five different ways are shown below:
- O O -
  O O -
- O O O
  O - O
- O - O
  O O O
- - O O
  O O -
- O O -
  - O O
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 1
Output: 1
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 1000`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Is `n` always a positive integer?
   - **A:** Yes, `n` is always a positive integer.
   
2. **Q:** Are there limitations on the size of the input beyond the constraint?
   - **A:** The input `n` is limited to 1000 as per the constraints provided.

3. **Q:** Can the board be partially filled in any configuration?
   - **A:** No, the board must be completely filled using the tiles.

## Strategy
This is a dynamic programming (DP) problem. We need to find the number of ways to tile a `2 x n` board, leveraging smaller subproblems. We can utilize the following observations:

1. **Subproblem Definition:**
   `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to fully cover a `2 x i` board.

2. **Base Cases:**
   - `dp[0] = 1` (an empty board)
   - `dp[1] = 1` (only one way to place a single domino)

3. **Recurrence Relation:**
   - Consider placing the last tile(s):
     - Placing one vertical domino at the end (`dp[n-1]`)
     - Placing two horizontal dominos one above the other (`dp[n-2]`)
     - Additionally, considering the placement of trominoes in certain configurations.

We need to consider interactions when the board has positions that can match the tromino shapes. Letâ€™s define additional states:
- `dp[i]`: The number of ways to cover a `2 x i` board.
- `dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] + 2 * sum(dp[0] to dp[i-3])`

Adding a more detailed breakdown for our DP:
```
dp[i] += dp[i-3]
dp[i] += sum(dp[0 to i-3])
```

To optimize the implementation:
- We can maintain running sums to avoid repeated summation calculations.

## Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public static final int MOD = 1000000007;

    public int numTilings(int n) {
        if (n == 1) return 1;
        if (n == 2) return 2;
        
        long[] dp = new long[n+1];
        dp[0] = 1;  // There's one way to fill a 2x0 board
        dp[1] = 1;  // There's one way to fill a 2x1 board
        dp[2] = 2;  // There are two ways to fill a 2x2 board

        // Sum of dp[0 to i-3]
        long prevSum = 0;  

        for(int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            if (i >= 3) {
                prevSum += dp[i-3];
                prevSum %= MOD;
            }
            dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] + 2 * prevSum) % MOD;
        }

        return (int) dp[n];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        // Test with example cases
        System.out.println(solution.numTilings(3)); // Output: 5
        System.out.println(solution.numTilings(1)); // Output: 1
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` since we are iterating through the sequence to populate the DP array.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` as we are storing results for each subproblem in the DP array.
