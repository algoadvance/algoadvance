[Leetcode 940. Distinct Subsequences II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l940)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return the number of distinct non-empty subsequences of `s`. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is a subsequence?**
   - A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

2. **Should we consider the empty subsequence?**
   - No, we should only count non-empty subsequences.

3. **Are there any constraints on the length of the string `s`?**
   - The length of `s` will be at most 2000.

4. **How do we handle large numbers?**
   - We return the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

5. **What characters can `s` consist of?**
   - The string `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. Let's consider how we can build the solution iteratively:

1. **Initialization:**
   - We maintain an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the number of distinct subsequences in the substring `s[0:i]`.

2. **State Transition:**
   - For each character in the string `s`, we need to calculate the number of new subsequences that can be formed by including this character to the subsequences counted so far.
   - If we add the current character `s[i]` to each of the existing subsequences formed by `s[0:i-1]`, we can form new subsequences.

3. **Avoiding Duplicates:**
   - However, we must ensure that we are not counting duplicate subsequences. To handle duplicates, we can keep track of the last occurrence of each character.

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - To control the number sizes, we will use modulo `10^9 + 7` at each step.

### Code Implementation

Here is the Java implementation for this strategy:

```java
public class DistinctSubsequencesII {
    public int distinctSubseqII(String s) {
        int MOD = 1000000007;
        int n = s.length();
        // dp[i] represents the number of distinct subsequences in s[0:i-1]
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[0] = 1; // Empty substring

        int[] last = new int[26]; // To store the last occurrence of each character
        Arrays.fill(last, -1);

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            char c = s.charAt(i - 1);
            dp[i] = (2 * dp[i - 1]) % MOD;

            if (last[c - 'a'] != -1) {
                dp[i] = (dp[i] - dp[last[c - 'a']] + MOD) % MOD;
            }

            last[c - 'a'] = i - 1;
        }

        // Subtract 1 for excluding the empty subsequence
        return (dp[n] - 1 + MOD) % MOD;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DistinctSubsequencesII solution = new DistinctSubsequencesII();
        String testString = "ababc";
        System.out.println(solution.distinctSubseqII(testString)); // Expected output: various depending on the input string
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`:
- We iterate through the string once.
- Each operation within the loop (including array updates and modulo operations) is `O(1)`.

The space complexity is also `O(n)` due to the dynamic programming array `dp` and the `last` array of fixed size 26.
