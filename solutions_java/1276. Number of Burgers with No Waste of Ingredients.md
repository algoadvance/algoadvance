[Leetcode 1276. Number of Burgers with No Waste of Ingredients](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1276)
### Problem Statement
You are given two integers, `tomatoSlices` and `cheeseSlices`. The objective is to find how many jumbo and small burgers one can make such that:
- A jumbo burger requires 4 tomato slices and 1 cheese slice.
- A small burger requires 2 tomato slices and 1 cheese slice.

Return a list of two integers `[number_of_jumbo_burgers, number_of_small_burgers]` such that there is no leftover of tomatoes or cheese. If it is not possible to make such a distribution, return an empty list.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints on Input**: What are the minimum and maximum values for `tomatoSlices` and `cheeseSlices`?
2. **Output Format**: Should the output always be a list, even in the case of no solution?
3. **Edge Cases**: Are there any edge cases we need to consider, such as 0 `tomatoSlices` or 0 `cheeseSlices`?

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to form a system of linear equations based on the given constraints:
1. Let `X` be the number of jumbo burgers.
2. Let `Y` be the number of small burgers.

From the problem statement, we can derive two equations:
1. `4 * X + 2 * Y = tomatoSlices`
2. `X + Y = cheeseSlices`

By solving these equations, we get:
- From the second equation: `Y = cheeseSlices - X`
- Substitute `Y` in the first equation: `4 * X + 2 * (cheeseSlices - X) = tomatoSlices`

This simplifies to:
- `4 * X + 2 * cheeseSlices - 2 * X = tomatoSlices`
- `2 * X + 2 * cheeseSlices = tomatoSlices`
- `2 * X = tomatoSlices - 2 * cheeseSlices`
- `X = (tomatoSlices - 2 * cheeseSlices) / 2`

Using these values, we need to check:
1. If `(tomatoSlices - 2 * cheeseSlices) % 2 == 0` (to ensure `X` is an integer).
2. `X >= 0` and `Y >= 0` to validate non-negative values for the number of burgers.

If all conditions are met, we return `[X, cheeseSlices - X]`. Otherwise, return an empty list.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> numOfBurgers(int tomatoSlices, int cheeseSlices) {
        // Check if the derived equation leads to integers for X and Y.
        if ((tomatoSlices - 2 * cheeseSlices) % 2 != 0) {
            return new ArrayList<>();
        }
        
        int x = (tomatoSlices - 2 * cheeseSlices) / 2;
        int y = cheeseSlices - x;

        if (x < 0 || y < 0) {
            return new ArrayList<>();
        }
        
        return Arrays.asList(x, y);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is `O(1)`, as we're only performing a few arithmetic operations irrespective of the input size.
- The space complexity is also `O(1)`, as no additional data structures are used other than for the result.

This approach efficiently determines the number of each type of burger or returns an empty list if it is not possible to form the required burgers.
