[Leetcode 1051. Height Checker](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1051)
### Problem Statement
A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single line in non-decreasing order by height. Letâ€™s assume that heights are represented by an integer array. You need to return the number of indices where the heights do not match the expected heights.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the range of the heights that can be provided? Usually, heights fall between a certain range, such as 1 to 100.
   - Can the height array be empty?
  
2. **Expected Output**:
   - Should I return the number of positions that do not match or the positions themselves?

### Strategy
1. **Initial Approach**:
   - Clone the original array.
   - Sort the cloned array.
   - Compare each element of the original array with the sorted array and count the indices where the elements differ.

### Code
```java
public class HeightChecker {
    public int heightChecker(int[] heights) {
        // Create a copy of the original array
        int[] expected = heights.clone();
        // Sort the copied array
        Arrays.sort(expected);
        
        int mismatchCount = 0;
        // Compare the original array to the sorted array
        for (int i = 0; i < heights.length; i++) {
            if (heights[i] != expected[i]) {
                mismatchCount++;
            }
        }
        
        return mismatchCount;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HeightChecker hc = new HeightChecker();
        int[] heights = {1,1,4,2,1,3};
        System.out.println(hc.heightChecker(heights)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

### Strategy Explanation
1. **Clone and Sort**:
    - Cloning the original array helps to retain the original sequence before sorting.
    - Sorting the clone provides the expected sequence if the students were standing in non-decreasing order by height.
  
2. **Comparison**:
    - By comparing each student's height in the original array to the sorted array, we can determine the exact number of mismatches.
   
### Time Complexity
- **Cloning and Sorting**:
  - Cloning the array takes `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of students.
  - Sorting the array takes `O(n log n)`.
  
- **Comparison**:
  - Comparing the original array to the sorted array takes `O(n)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which is `O(n log n)`.

### Considerations
- Edge cases:
  - If the array is empty, the script should handle that properly, but generally, no mismatches would occur.
  - Ensure that the function handles different array lengths efficiently.
