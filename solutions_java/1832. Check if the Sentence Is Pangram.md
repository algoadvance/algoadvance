[Leetcode 1832. Check if the Sentence Is Pangram](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1832)
## Problem Statement
A **pangram** is a sentence where every letter of the English alphabet appears at least once.

Given a string `sentence` containing only lowercase English letters, return `true` if `sentence` is a pangram, or `false` otherwise.

### Example
```text
Input: sentence = "thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog"
Output: true
Explanation: The sentence contains at least one of every letter of the English alphabet.

Input: sentence = "leetcode"
Output: false
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input constraints:** What is the maximum length of the input sentence? 
   - *Assumption:* The maximum length of `sentence` can be large, but for practical purposes, we might assume up to around 10^4 characters since it's feasible to handle such strings in memory.
2. **Character constraints:** Are there any non-ASCII punctuation or special characters?
   - No, the sentence contains only lowercase English letters.

## Strategy
We can solve this problem using a set to track which characters we have encountered in the sentence. The idea is to:
1. Create a set to store each unique character encountered in the string.
2. Iterate through each character in the input sentence.
3. Add each character to the set.
4. After processing the sentence, if the set contains 26 unique characters, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

This approach works because the set automatically handles duplicates and ensures that only unique characters are counted.

## Code

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class Solution {
    public boolean checkIfPangram(String sentence) {
        // A set to keep track of unique characters
        Set<Character> uniqueCharacters = new HashSet<>();

        // Iterate over each character in the sentence
        for (char c : sentence.toCharArray()) {
            uniqueCharacters.add(c);
        }

        // There are 26 letters in the English alphabet
        return uniqueCharacters.size() == 26;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String sentence1 = "thequickbrownfoxjumpsoverthelazydog";
        String sentence2 = "leetcode";

        Solution sol = new Solution();

        System.out.println(sol.checkIfPangram(sentence1)); // Output: true
        System.out.println(sol.checkIfPangram(sentence2)); // Output: false
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input string. We iterate over each character exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1). The size of the set is limited to 26 characters (constant space), regardless of the input size. The additional space used by the set does not scale with the size of the input sentence.
