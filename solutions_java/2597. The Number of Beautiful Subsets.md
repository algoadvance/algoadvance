[Leetcode 2597. The Number of Beautiful Subsets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2597)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of positive integers and a positive integer `k`, return the number of beautiful subsets. A subset of `nums` is considered beautiful if it satisfies both of the following conditions:

1. The subset is non-empty.
2. For every pair of integers `(a, b)` in the subset such that `a != b`, the absolute difference between `a` and `b` is not equal to `k`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the subset include duplicate values?
   - It seems more natural to consider subsets as unique combinations of values from `nums`, so ideally no duplicates.
   
2. Should the solution handle large datasets?
   - This affects the complexity considerations, so it's good to know if we should optimize for very large input sizes.
   
3. Is the input array guaranteed to have at least one element?
   - Assuming `nums` is non-empty as the problem specifies subsets must be non-empty.

4. Can the elements of `nums` and `k` be very large?
   - This could affect computational limits and optimization details.

## Strategy

To solve the problem, let's adopt a backtracking approach:

1. Use a recursive function to explore all possible subsets of the input `nums` array.
2. For each subset, check if it satisfies the "beautiful" condition.
3. Keep a running count of all beautiful subsets encountered.

The backtracking function will:
- Include the current element in the subset or exclude it.
- Before including an element, ensure that it forms a beautiful subset with previously included elements.
- Keep track of the count of all valid "beautiful" subsets.

## Code

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class Solution {
    public int beautifulSubsets(int[] nums, int k) {
        return backtrack(nums, k, 0, new HashSet<>());
    }

    private int backtrack(int[] nums, int k, int index, Set<Integer> current) {
        if (index == nums.length) {
            // We count only non-empty subsets
            return current.isEmpty() ? 0 : 1;
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        boolean canInclude = true;
        
        // Check if including nums[index] violates the beautiful condition
        for (int num : current) {
            if (Math.abs(num - nums[index]) == k) {
                canInclude = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        
        // Option 1: Include nums[index] if it's possible
        if (canInclude) {
            current.add(nums[index]);
            count += backtrack(nums, k, index + 1, current);
            current.remove(nums[index]);
        }
        
        // Option 2: Exclude nums[index] and proceed
        count += backtrack(nums, k, index + 1, current);
        
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {2, 4, 6};
        int k = 2;
        int result = solution.beautifulSubsets(nums, k);
        System.out.println(result);  // Output: 4 (Ex: [2], [4], [6], [2, 6])
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution primarily depends on the number of subsets we explore:
- Generating all subsets for an array of `n` elements results in `2^n` possible subsets.
- For each subset, in the worst-case scenario, we might need to check all pairs to ensure the "beautiful" condition. This pair-checking is `O(n^2)` if done naively, but here we check the constraint in a more pragmatic way within our recursive exploration.

Thus, in practical terms, the approximate complexity is `O(n * 2^n)`, but the number of recursive calls to "backtrack" is exponentially based on the input size `n`.

## Summary

The given solution takes a backtracking approach to explore all possible subsets of the array while ensuring the subsets meet the "beautiful" criteria. The method considers both including and excluding each element, and it correctly computes the number of subsets. The time complexity is exponential due to the nature of subset generation.
