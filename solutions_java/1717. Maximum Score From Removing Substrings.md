[Leetcode 1717. Maximum Score From Removing Substrings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1717)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and two integers `x` and `y`, you are tasked with removing substrings "`ab`" and "`ba`" from `s` in such a way to maximize the score. Removing an "`ab`" substring earns you `x` points, and removing a "`ba`" substring earns you `y` points.

1. You can only remove non-overlapping substrings.
2. After removing a substring, the string may become rearranged and new substrings may be created that can be removed, so you need to repeat the process of removal until no more substrings can be removed.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input length**: Is there any constraint on the length of the string `s`? 
   - **Answer**: The input length is up to `10^5`.

2. **Characters in the string**: Is the string guaranteed to only contain lowercase letters 'a' and 'b'?
   - **Answer**: Yes, you can assume the string only contains characters 'a' and 'b'.

3. **Equal scores**: What should be done if `x` equals `y`?
   - **Answer**: Follow the same strategy since it won't affect the algorithm's logic.

4. **Order of removal**: Should we favor removing one type of substring over the other if `x` and `y` are different?
   - **Answer**: Yes, we should prioritize removing the substring that gives the highest score first to maximize the total score.

### Strategy

To maximize the score:
1. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, then prioritize removing "ab" first.
2. Otherwise, prioritize removing "ba" first.

Given the nature of the problem, a stack-based approach can be efficient due to the linear processing of characters, making sure we handle overlapping substrings and their transformations elegantly.

### Code

Here's the Java code implementing the strategy:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MaximumScoreFromRemovingSubstrings {
    
    public int maximumGain(String s, int x, int y) {
        if (x < y) {
            return removeSubstrings(s, 'b', 'a', y) + removeSubstrings(s, 'a', 'b', x);
        } else {
            return removeSubstrings(s, 'a', 'b', x) + removeSubstrings(s, 'b', 'a', y);
        }
    }
    
    private int removeSubstrings(String s, char first, char second, int score) {
        int totalScore = 0;
        Deque<Character> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() == first && c == second) {
                stack.pop();
                totalScore += score;
            } else {
                stack.push(c);
            }
        }
        
        return totalScore;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximumScoreFromRemovingSubstrings solution = new MaximumScoreFromRemovingSubstrings();
        System.out.println(solution.maximumGain("cdbcbbaaabab", 4, 5)); // Output: 19
        System.out.println(solution.maximumGain("aabbaaxybbaabb", 3, 4)); // Output: 20
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The solution traverses the string twice, each with a linear pass through the characters, resulting in `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(n)` due to the stack usage in the worst-case scenario where no characters are removed.

This approach ensures that we prioritize the high-value substrings first and remove as many of those as possible before tackling the lower-value ones, thereby maximizing the total score.
