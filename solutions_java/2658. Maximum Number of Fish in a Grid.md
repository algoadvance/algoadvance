[Leetcode 2658. Maximum Number of Fish in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2658)
### Problem Statement

You are given a grid `grid` of size `m x n`, where each cell contains:

- A non-negative integer which indicates the number of fish in that cell.
- If a cell contains zero, it means there are no fish in that cell.

You can move only in four directions: up, down, left, and right. You can start from any cell that contains fish and collect all the fish by visiting cells with fish. You cannot collect fish from cells with `0`.

Your task is to find the maximum number of fish you can collect starting from any cell and moving in the four allowed directions.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we move back to a previously visited cell?**
   - No, we cannot return to a previously visited cell during the same collection sequence.

2. **Is the grid guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, the grid has at least one cell.

3. **What are the constraints on the grid size?**
   - The grid dimensions `m` and `n` will typically be within a reasonable range, such as `1 <= m, n <= 50`.

4. **Are there restrictions on how many times we can move in the four allowed directions?**
   - There is no explicit restriction on the number of moves other than the boundaries of the grid and cells with `0`.

### Strategy

We can solve the problem using Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore all possible paths starting from cells containing fish.
- We will iterate through each cell in the grid.
- For each cell that contains fish, we will initiate a DFS to collect as many fish as possible from connected components.
- We will keep track of visited cells to prevent counting the same fish more than once during a single DFS call.
- We will compare and store the maximum fish count obtained from all possible DFS starts.

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int getMaximumFish(int[][] grid) {
        int maxFish = 0;
        int rows = grid.length;
        int cols = grid[0].length;
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[rows][cols];
        
        // Iterate through the grid, starting DFS from cells containing fish
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] > 0 && !visited[i][j]) {
                    maxFish = Math.max(maxFish, dfs(grid, visited, i, j));
                }
            }
        }
        
        return maxFish;
    }
    
    private int dfs(int[][] grid, boolean[][] visited, int i, int j) {
        int rows = grid.length;
        int cols = grid[0].length;

        // Boundary conditions and visiting check
        if (i < 0 || i >= rows || j < 0 || j >= cols || grid[i][j] == 0 || visited[i][j]) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        // Mark the cell as visited
        visited[i][j] = true;
        
        // Fish count at current cell
        int fishCount = grid[i][j];
        
        // Explore all 4 possible directions: up, down, left, right
        fishCount += dfs(grid, visited, i - 1, j); // up
        fishCount += dfs(grid, visited, i + 1, j); // down
        fishCount += dfs(grid, visited, i, j - 1); // left
        fishCount += dfs(grid, visited, i, j + 1); // right
        
        return fishCount;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Grid Traversal**: We iterate over each cell once, hence `O(m * n)`.
- **DFS Exploration**: Each cell might be visited once during DFS, making it equivalent to linear exploration on the grid as well.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(m * n)** where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid.

### Space Complexity

- **Visited Array**: The space required to keep track of visited cells is `O(m * n)`.
- **Call Stack**: In the worst case, the depth of the recursive DFS call stack can be `O(m * n)`.

Therefore, the space complexity is **O(m * n)**.
