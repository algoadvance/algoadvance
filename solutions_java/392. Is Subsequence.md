[Leetcode 392. Is Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l392)
## Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return true if `s` is a subsequence of `t`, or false otherwise.

A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `"ace"` is a subsequence of `"abcde"` while `"aec"` is not).

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "abc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: true
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "axc", t = "ahbgdc"
Output: false
```

### Constraints:
- `0 <= s.length <= 100`
- `0 <= t.length <= 10^4`
- Both `s` and `t` consist only of lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if `s` is an empty string?**
   - An empty string is considered a subsequence of any string, so the function should return `true`.

2. **What if `t` is an empty string but `s` is not?**
   - If `t` is empty and `s` is not, the function should return `false`.

## Strategy

1. Use two pointers, one for each string, starting from the beginning.
2. Iterate through `t` using a pointer `j`.
3. For each character in `t`, if it matches the current character in `s` pointed by the pointer `i`, move the pointer `i` to the next character in `s`.
4. If pointer `i` reaches the end of `s`, this means all characters of `s` were found in sequence within `t`, hence return `true`.
5. If you finish iterating through `t` without `i` reaching the end of `s`, return `false`.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean isSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        if (s.length() == 0) return true;

        int i = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < t.length(); j++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == t.charAt(j)) {
                i++;
                if (i == s.length()) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of string `t`. We are iterating through `t` once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using only a constant amount of extra space for the pointers.

This ensures that the algorithm is efficient even with the maximum constraints.
