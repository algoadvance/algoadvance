[Leetcode 344. Reverse String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l344)
## Problem Statement

The problem is to reverse a given string in place. The function should do this without using any extra space for another array (modifying the input array directly is required).

Leetcode Problem Number: 344

Given a character array `s`, reverse the array.

### Example:
```java
Input: ['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
Output: ['o', 'l', 'l', 'e', 'h']
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Type**: Is the input guaranteed to be a character array?
   - Yes.
   
2. **In-place Requirement**: Are we allowed to use extra space, such as another array, to store the result?
   - No, the array must be reversed in place.

3. **Input Size**: Is there a constraint on the size of the input array?
   - No specific constraint, but generally expect it to be reasonably sized to fit in memory.

4. **Unicode Characters**: Does the array contain only ASCII characters, or can it contain Unicode characters?
   - It can contain Unicode characters, but the operations would be the same as with ASCII.

## Strategy

To reverse the string in place, we can use the two-pointer technique:

1. Initialize two pointers: one (`left`) at the beginning of the array and the other (`right`) at the end of the array.
2. Swap the elements at these two pointers.
3. Move the `left` pointer one step to the right and the `right` pointer one step to the left.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until `left` is greater than or equal to `right`.

This approach ensures we process each character only once and swap them in place without using any extra space.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the array because we are iterating over the array and performing a constant-time swap operation for each element.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), because we are modifying the array in place without using additional space.

## Code

Here's the Java implementation of the above strategy:

```java
public class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = s.length - 1;
        
        while (left < right) {
            char temp = s[left];
            s[left] = s[right];
            s[right] = temp;
            left++;
            right--;
        }
    }
}
```

This code defines a class `Solution` with a method `reverseString` that takes a character array `s` as input and reverses it in place. 

The `while` loop continues until the `left` pointer is no longer less than the `right` pointer, ensuring that we swap elements from the outside towards the center of the array.
