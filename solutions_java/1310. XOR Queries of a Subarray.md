[Leetcode 1310. XOR Queries of a Subarray](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1310)
### Problem Statement

The problem asks you to solve the following:

Given an array `arr` of integers and a 2D array `queries` where each `queries[i] = [L, R]`, for each query, compute the XOR of elements from the subarray `arr[L]` to `arr[R]` (both inclusive) and return an array containing the result for each query.

**Example:**
```
Input: arr = [1,3,4,8], queries = [[0,1],[1,2],[0,3],[3,3]]
Output: [2,7,14,8]

Explanation:
The XOR results of queries are:
[0,1] -> 1 XOR 3 = 2
[1,2] -> 3 XOR 4 = 7
[0,3] -> 1 XOR 3 XOR 4 XOR 8 = 14
[3,3] -> 8
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints:**
   - What are the constraints on the size of `arr` and `queries`?
   - Constraints on the elements within `arr`?
   
2. **Input Guarantees:**
   - Can `queries` have invalid indices that are outside the bounds of `arr`?
   
3. **Output Format:**
   - Should the output be returned as a list or directly printed?

Given typical competitive programming conventions, the constraints might be fairly large, and we will assume that query indices will be valid.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, especially considering potentially large size constraints, a prefix XOR approach is viable:

1. **Prefix XOR Array:**
   - Construct a prefix XOR array, where each element at index `i` in this array contains the XOR of all elements from the start of `arr` to `i`.

2. **Query Resolution:**
   - For each query `[L, R]`, the result can be computed as:
     - If `L == 0`, the result is simply `prefixXOR[R]`
     - Otherwise, the result will be `prefixXOR[R] ^ prefixXOR[L-1]`

This approach reduces the complexity of each query to O(1) after an initial preprocessing step of O(n).

### Code

Here is the Java implementation of the above approach:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int[] xorQueries(int[] arr, int[][] queries) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int[] prefixXOR = new int[n];
        
        // Calculate prefix XOR
        prefixXOR[0] = arr[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            prefixXOR[i] = prefixXOR[i-1] ^ arr[i];
        }

        int m = queries.length;
        int[] result = new int[m];
        
        // Resolve each query
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            int L = queries[i][0];
            int R = queries[i][1];
            if (L == 0) {
                result[i] = prefixXOR[R];
            } else {
                result[i] = prefixXOR[R] ^ prefixXOR[L-1];
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] arr = {1, 3, 4, 8};
        int[][] queries = {{0, 1}, {1, 2}, {0, 3}, {3, 3}};
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(sol.xorQueries(arr, queries)));  // Output: [2, 7, 14, 8]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing Step:**
  - Constructing the prefix XOR array: O(n)
  
- **Query Resolution:**
  - Each query is resolved in O(1), so resolving all queries in O(m)

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n + m), where `n` is the size of the array and `m` is the number of queries. This is efficient and suitable for large inputs.
