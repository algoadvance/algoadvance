[Leetcode 1610. Maximum Number of Visible Points](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1610)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `points`, an integer `angle`, and your `location`, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the coordinates of the ith point on a 2D plane. The `location` is also in the form of `[x, y]` and represents your position on the 2D plane.

You want to know the maximum number of points that you can see if you can rotate your view counterclockwise by an angle of not greater than `angle` degrees from your location.

Your viewing angle can be calculated from the `x-axis` towards the positive `y-axis.

Return the maximum number of points that you can see.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Clarification on Coordinates and Angle:**
   - Coordinates and angle are in integer values.
   - The angle is between 1 and 360 degrees.

2. **Visibility Condition:**
   - How should we handle points that are directly situated at the `location`? This is relevant since points at the location don't involve any viewing angle.

### Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public int visiblePoints(List<List<Integer>> points, int angle, List<Integer> location) {
        int sameLocationCount = 0;
        List<Double> polarDegrees = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Convert points to angles relative to location
        int locX = location.get(0);
        int locY = location.get(1);
        
        for (List<Integer> point : points) {
            int x = point.get(0);
            int y = point.get(1);
            
            if (x == locX && y == locY) {
                sameLocationCount++;
            } else {
                double degree = Math.toDegrees(Math.atan2(y - locY, x - locX));
                if (degree < 0) degree += 360; // Normalize degree to be within [0, 360)
                polarDegrees.add(degree);
            }
        }
        
        // Sort angles
        Collections.sort(polarDegrees);

        // Duplicate the sorted angles list by appending each angle plus 360
        int n = polarDegrees.size();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            polarDegrees.add(polarDegrees.get(i) + 360);
        }
        
        // Use sliding window to find the maximum points within a specific angle
        int maxCount = 0;
        int start = 0;
        for (int end = 0; end < polarDegrees.size(); end++) {
            while (polarDegrees.get(end) - polarDegrees.get(start) > angle) {
                start++;
            }
            maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, end - start + 1);
        }
        
        return sameLocationCount + maxCount;
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Identify Points at the Same Location:**
   - Track points that are exactly at the specified location separately as they do not contribute to the angular distance calculation.

2. **Convert Points to Polar Angles:**
   - Calculate the angle of each point relative to the location using `atan2`.
   - Adjust calculated angles to be within the range `[0, 360)` degrees.

3. **Sort Angles:**
   - Sort the angles in ascending order to facilitate the sliding window technique.

4. **Handle Circular Nature:**
   - Duplicate the angle list with each angle plus `360` degrees to handle the circular nature of angles.

5. **Sliding Window Technique:**
   - Use a sliding window to keep track of the maximum number of points within the specified viewing angle by maintaining two pointers over the sorted angle list.

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the Angles:** `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of points.
- **Sliding Window:** `O(2n)` since the extended angle list is twice the original size.
- Overall complexity remains `O(n log n)` due to sorting, dominating the linear pass of the sliding window.

This approach ensures efficient computation of the maximum number of points visible within the given angle.
