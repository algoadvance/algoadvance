[Leetcode 677. Map Sum Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l677)
### Problem Statement
You are tasked with implementing the `MapSum` class, which supports the following two methods:

1. `void insert(String key, int val)`: Inserts the key-value pair into the map. If the key already exists, the original key-value pair will be overridden to the new one.
2. `int sum(String prefix)`: Returns the sum of all the pairs' values whose keys start with the specified prefix.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the keys contain non-alphabetic characters?
   **A:** For this problem, we can assume keys are strings consisting of lowercase English letters.

2. **Q:** Could there be any constraints on the length of keys or the number of key-value pairs?
   **A:** The problem does not specify constraints. We can assume typical constraints for such problems where the input size is manageable within memory limits of typical competitive programming environments.

3. **Q:** How should we handle an insert operation with a key that already exists?
   **A:** If the key already exists, the existing value must be replaced with the new value provided during the insert operation.

### Strategy
1. **Data Structures:**
   - We will use a `HashMap` to store the key-value pairs.
   - We need to efficiently sum values with a specific prefix, which suggests using a `Trie` (prefix tree) data structure. Each node in the Trie will carry:
     - A `Map` to its children nodes.
     - A variable to keep track of the sum of values of keys that pass through or terminate at that node.

2. **Insert Operation:** 
   - Insert the key-value pair into the `HashMap`.
   - Traverse through the Trie from root to the end of the key, updating the sum at each node.

3. **Sum Operation:** 
   - Traverse the Trie nodes according to the prefix.
   - Once at the end of the prefix node, return the sum stored in that node.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

class MapSum {
    class TrieNode {
        Map<Character, TrieNode> children = new HashMap<>();
        int value = 0;
    }

    private TrieNode root;
    private Map<String, Integer> map;

    public MapSum() {
        root = new TrieNode();
        map = new HashMap<>();
    }

    public void insert(String key, int val) {
        int delta = val - map.getOrDefault(key, 0);
        map.put(key, val);
        TrieNode node = root;
        for (char c : key.toCharArray()) {
            node = node.children.computeIfAbsent(c, k -> new TrieNode());
            node.value += delta;
        }
    }

    public int sum(String prefix) {
        TrieNode node = root;
        for (char c : prefix.toCharArray()) {
            node = node.children.get(c);
            if (node == null) {
                return 0;
            }
        }
        return node.value;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MapSum mapSum = new MapSum();
        mapSum.insert("apple", 3);
        System.out.println(mapSum.sum("ap")); // Output: 3
        mapSum.insert("app", 2);
        System.out.println(mapSum.sum("ap")); // Output: 5
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Insert Operation:** `O(L)` where `L` is the length of the key. This is because we traverse the key to update the Trie and `HashMap`.
- **Sum Operation:** `O(P)` where `P` is the length of the prefix. We only traverse the Trie nodes up to the length of the prefix.
