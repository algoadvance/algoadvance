[Leetcode 203. Remove Linked List Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l203)
## Problem Statement

This is a problem from LeetCode, problem number 203:

Given the `head` of a linked list and an integer `val`, remove all the nodes of the linked list that has `Node.val == val`, and return the new head.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,6,3,4,5,6], val = 6
Output: [1,2,3,4,5]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: head = [], val = 1
Output: []
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: head = [7,7,7,7], val = 7
Output: []
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the input list size?**
   - The input list can have from 0 to \(10^4\) nodes.
   
2. **What is the range of node values?**
   - Each node's value can be any integer.

3. **Do we need to consider the cases where the input linked list is `null` explicitly?**
   - Yes, we should handle the case where the input linked list is `null`.

4. **Is this a singly linked list or doubly linked list?**
   - This is a singly linked list.

## Strategy

1. **Dummy Node Approach:**
   - Create a dummy node that points to the head of the list. This helps in simplifying edge cases, particularly when the head itself needs to be removed.
   
2. **Iterate Through List:**
   - Iterate through the linked list using two pointers: a previous pointer (`prev`) and a current pointer (`curr`).
   - Check if the current node's value equals the target value.
   - If it does, adjust the previous node's `next` to skip the current node.
   - If it does not, move the previous pointer to the current node.
   - Always move the current pointer to the next node.

3. **Return the new head:**
   - Return the next node of the dummy node, which is the new head of the resulting list.

## Code

```java
public class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

public class Solution {
    public ListNode removeElements(ListNode head, int val) {
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;
        ListNode prev = dummy, curr = head;
        
        while (curr != null) {
            if (curr.val == val) {
                prev.next = curr.next;
            } else {
                prev = curr;
            }
            curr = curr.next;
        }
        
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
  - We traverse each node exactly once.
  
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\)
  - We use a constant amount of extra space.
