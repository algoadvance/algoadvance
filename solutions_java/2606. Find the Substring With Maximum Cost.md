[Leetcode 2606. Find the Substring With Maximum Cost](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2606)
## Problem Statement
You are given a string `s`, a string `chars`, and an integer array `vals` of the same length as `chars`.

The value of the substring `s[i:j]` is the sum of values of each character in the substring, where the value of the character is determined by the following rule:
- If the character is in `chars`, then its value is `vals[chars.indexOf(char)]`.
- If the character is not in `chars`, then its value is its ASCII value.

Return the maximum value among all non-empty substrings of `s`.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: s = "abc", chars = "ac", vals = [5, 1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The value of the substring "a" is 5, and the value of the substring "c" is 1. The value of the substring "abc" is 5 + 98 + 1 = 104. The value of the substring "ab" is 5 + 98 = 103. The value of the substring "bc" is 98 + 1 = 99.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the length of the strings `s` and `chars`?
   **A**: You can assume 1 <= `s.length`, `chars.length` <= 1000.

2. **Q**: Can `chars` contain characters that are not in `s`?
   **A**: Yes, `chars` can contain characters not present in `s`.

3. **Q**: Can `vals` have negative numbers?
   **A**: Yes, `vals` can have negative numbers.

4. **Q**: Are the characters in `chars` unique?
   **A**: Yes, all characters in `chars` are unique.

## Strategy
1. **Mapping Character Values**:
   Create a map to store the values of characters as defined by `chars` and `vals`.

2. **Kadane's Algorithm**:
   Use Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum subarray:
   - Iterate through `s` and calculate the value of each character based on the map.
   - Track the maximum sum and update it using Kadane's algorithm.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Convert `s` to an array of values, where each value is determined based on whether the character is in `chars`.
   - Apply Kadane's algorithm on this array to find the maximum sum subarray.

## Code
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class FindSubstringWithMaximumCost {
    public int maximumCostSubstring(String s, String chars, int[] vals) {
        int n = s.length();
        Map<Character, Integer> charValueMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Create the character-value map based on chars and vals
        for (int i = 0; i < chars.length(); i++) {
            charValueMap.put(chars.charAt(i), vals[i]);
        }
        
        // Transform s into an array of values
        int[] valueArray = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            valueArray[i] = charValueMap.getOrDefault(c, (int) c);
        }
        
        // Apply Kadane's algorithm to find the maximum sum subarray
        int maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int currentSum = 0;
        
        for (int value : valueArray) {
            currentSum = Math.max(value, currentSum + value);
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);
        }
        
        return maxSum;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Mapping Creation**: `O(m)`, where `m` is the length of `chars`.
- **Transformation to Value Array**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`.
- **Kadane's Algorithm**: `O(n)`, for a single pass through the array to find the maximum sum subarray.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n + m)`.
