[Leetcode 1411. Number of Ways to Paint N × 3 Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1411)
## Problem Statement

You have a `n x 3` grid and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of the three colors: Red, Yellow, or Green. Return the number of ways to paint the grid such that no two adjacent cells have the same color. Cells are adjacent if they share an edge.

Given an integer `n`, return the number of ways to paint the grid.

### Example:
```
Input: n = 1
Output: 12

Input: n = 2
Output: 54
```

### Constraints:
- `n == 1` or `n == 2`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the colors fixed to exactly three (Red, Yellow, Green)?**
   - Yes.
2. **Are only the cells in the same row and columns considered adjacent?**
   - Yes, cells are considered adjacent if they share an edge.

## Strategy

1. **Understanding State Transitions:**
   - For each row of the grid, there are specific patterns we can use where no two adjacent cells have the same color.
   - Let's define two types of valid patterns:
     - **Type A (ABA pattern):** Patterns like `RYR`, `RGY`, `YRY`, etc. There are 6 such patterns.
     - **Type B (ABC pattern):** Patterns like `RYG`, `RBG`, `YRB`, etc. There are 6 such patterns.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Let `countA[i]` be the number of ways to paint up to the i-th row where the i-th row is of type A.
   - Let `countB[i]` be the number of ways to paint up to the i-th row where the i-th row is of type B.
   - For `i-th row`:
     - From `type A` to `i-th row to type A`: We transition from type A of the previous row to type A of the next row.
     - From `type A` to `i-th row to type B`: We transition from type A of the previous row to type B of the next row, and similarly for other states.

3. **Formulating the transitions:**
   - `countA[i] = 3 * countA[i-1] + 2 * countB[i-1]`
   - `countB[i] = 2 * countA[i-1] + 2 * countB[i-1]`

4. **Initialization:**
   - `countA[1] = 6` (All type A patterns for the first row)
   - `countB[1] = 6` (All type B patterns for the first row)

5. **Result:**
   - The result will be `countA[n] + countB[n]`.

## Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int numOfWays(int n) {
        // Initialize for the first row
        long countA = 6;
        long countB = 6;
        long MOD = 1_000_000_007;

        // Iterate over the rows from 2 to n
        for (int i = 2; i <= n; ++i) {
            long prevCountA = countA;
            long prevCountB = countB;

            // Update countA and countB using the state transition rules
            countA = (3 * prevCountA + 2 * prevCountB) % MOD;
            countB = (2 * prevCountA + 2 * prevCountB) % MOD;
        }

        // The result is sum of the ways to form the last row of type A and type B
        return (int)((countA + countB) % MOD);
    }

    // Testing the implemented solution
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.numOfWays(1)); // Expected output: 12
        System.out.println(sol.numOfWays(2)); // Expected output: 54
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` because we iterate from `2` to `n` updating the counts.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` as we only use a constant amount of space to store the counts for the two previous states.
