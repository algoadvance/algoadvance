[Leetcode 932. Beautiful Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l932)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, return any beautiful array `A` that is a permutation of the integers from `1` to `n`. An array `A` is beautiful if for every `i < j < k`, it is not true that `A[k] * 2 = A[i] + A[j]`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of n**: What are the constraints on the value of `n`?
   - *Constraints*: `1 <= n <= 1000`

2. **Output**: Should the output be any valid beautiful array, or is there any particular order to be followed?
   - *Output*: Any valid permutation that satisfies the condition will suffice. The order is not specifically required.

3. **Duplicate Elements**: Are there any duplicates in the input range?
   - *Duplicates*: No, the elements are distinct integers from `1 to n`.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, a divide-and-conquer approach can be used. The key idea is to build the array recursively by separating the numbers into even and odd values.

1. **Base Case**: 
   - If `n` is `1`, return `[1]`.

2. **Recursive Step**: 
   - For a given `n`, split the array into two parts:
     - One part containing the sequence of odd numbers.
     - The other part containing the sequence of even numbers.
   - Recursively apply the beautiful array generation to both parts.
   - Merge the results from the recursive calls.

By separating into odd and even, we maintain the property that there are no three elements `i < j < k` such that `A[k] * 2 = A[i] + A[j]`, hence ensuring the array remains beautiful.

### Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class BeautifulArray {

    public int[] beautifulArray(int n) {
        return generate(n);
    }

    private int[] generate(int n) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        result.add(1); // Start with base case.
        
        while (result.size() < n) {
            List<Integer> temp = new ArrayList<>();
            // Generate the next sequence of evens and odds
            for (int num : result) {
                if (num * 2 - 1 <= n)
                    temp.add(num * 2 - 1);
            }
            for (int num : result) {
                if (num * 2 <= n)
                    temp.add(num * 2);
            }
            result = temp;
        }
        
        // Convert the list to the array
        int[] beautifulArray = new int[result.size()];
        for (int i = 0; i < result.size(); i++) {
            beautifulArray[i] = result.get(i);
        }
        
        return beautifulArray;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BeautifulArray solution = new BeautifulArray();
        int n = 5;
        int[] beautifulArr = solution.beautifulArray(n);
        for (int num : beautifulArr) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The approach generates the array in logarithmic splitting steps. The construction of each subsequent sequence is linear relative to the output size.
  - Overall, this results in a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\).

- **Space Complexity**: The additional space used for the intermediate lists will also follow \(O(n \log n)\) in the worst-case scenario considering the recursive nature of the function.
