[Leetcode 2747. Count Zero Request Servers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2747)
### Problem Statement

You are given `n` servers, each with an independent queue. You are also given a list of `logs` where each `logs[i] = [server_id, request_time]` indicates that the server with id `server_id` received a request at time `request_time`.

An idle server is a server that has not received any requests during the last `x` consecutive seconds. Your task is to determine the number of idle servers at each second.

Given:

- `n`: Total number of servers
- `logs`: List of lists where each item contains a `server_id` and `request_time`
- `x`: Duration (in seconds) for checking server idleness

You need to return a list of length `t` (total number of seconds observed from the logs) where the `i-th` element in the list is the number of idle servers at second `i`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the `server_id`s zero-indexed or one-indexed?
2. Is `t` the last time stamp mentioned in the logs?
3. Can two logs contain the same `server_id` but different `request_time` in no particular order?
4. Are the logs sorted in any way?

### Strategy

1. **Data Extraction**: Parse the given `logs` to determine the range of seconds (`t`).
2. **Initialization**: Create an array to keep track of the last request time for each server.
3. **Processing Logs**: Traverse through each second from 0 to `t`:
   - Update the last request time of the servers based on the logs.
   - Check which servers are idle in the past `x` seconds.
4. **Idle Server Counting**: For each second, count the number of servers that haven't received a request in the past `x` seconds.
5. **Complexity Optimization**: Use efficient updates and queries to minimize the time complexity.

### Code

Here is a solution in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class CountZeroRequestServers {
    public List<Integer> countZeroRequestServers(int n, int[][] logs, int x) {
        // Determine last time stamp in the logs to determine length of time array
        int t = Arrays.stream(logs).mapToInt(log -> log[1]).max().orElse(0);
        
        // Array to maintain the latest request time for each server
        int[] lastRequestTime = new int[n];
        // Initialize all servers' last request time as -1 (indicating never requested)
        Arrays.fill(lastRequestTime, -1);
        
        // Result list to store the number of idle servers at each second
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>(Collections.nCopies(t + 1, 0));
        
        // Fill last request times from the logs
        for (int[] log : logs) {
            lastRequestTime[log[0]] = log[1];
        }
        
        // Iterate through each second
        for (int i = 0; i <= t; i++) {
            int idleCount = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (lastRequestTime[j] == -1 || i - lastRequestTime[j] >= x) {
                    idleCount++;
                }
            }
            result.set(i, idleCount);
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CountZeroRequestServers solution = new CountZeroRequestServers();
        int n = 3;
        int[][] logs = // use example from above
        int x = 2;

        System.out.println(solution.countZeroRequestServers(n, logs, x)); 
        // Expected output based on logs and window time x to be analyzed
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization and Preprocessing**: `O(n + k)` where `n` is the number of servers and `k` is the number of logs.
- **Per Second Calculation**: `O(n * t)` where `t` is the maximum timestamp.
- **Overall Complexity**: `O(n * t)`, which may be reduced depending on the practical constraints.

The above solution ensures that we track request times effectively and can handle the count of idle servers efficiently.
