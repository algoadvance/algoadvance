[Leetcode 1335. Minimum Difficulty of a Job Schedule](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1335)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `jobDifficulty` and an integer `d`. The array represents the difficulty of jobs where the `i-th` job has a difficulty of `jobDifficulty[i]`. You want to schedule these jobs in `d` days in such a way that the maximum difficulty of a job schedule for a day is minimized. The difficulty of a job schedule for each day is the maximum difficulty of a job scheduled that day.

Return the minimum sum of difficulties of the job schedule. If you cannot find a schedule for the jobs such that all jobs are scheduled in `d` days, return -1.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: jobDifficulty = [6,5,4,3,2,1], d = 2
Output: 7
Explanation: First day you can finish the first 5 jobs, minimum difficulty = 6.
Second day you can finish the last job, minimum difficulty = 1.
The sum of difficulties = 6 + 1 = 7.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: jobDifficulty = [9,9,9], d = 4
Output: -1
Explanation: If you try to split the jobs into 4 days, you’ll find that it’s impossible.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: jobDifficulty = [1,1,1], d = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The schedule is one job per day, maximum difficulty is 1 for each day.
So sum of difficulties is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
```

**Note:**

- `1 <= jobDifficulty.length <= 300`
- `0 <= jobDifficulty[i] <= 1000`
- `1 <= d <= 10`

### Clarifying Questions

1. Do we need to consider the order of jobs in the `jobDifficulty` array?
   - Yes, the order should be maintained as given in the input array.
2. Can we have an empty array or all elements as 0 in `jobDifficulty`?
   - The constraints ensure that `jobDifficulty` length is between 1 and 300, and values are between 0 and 1000, so we need to handle regular integer values in this range.

### Strategy

A dynamic programming approach fits this problem well due to overlapping subproblems and the need to find the optimal solution.

1. **Define the State:** 
   - Let `dp[i][k]` be the minimum difficulty to schedule the first `i` jobs in `k` days.
   - The final answer will be `dp[n][d]` where `n` is the length of `jobDifficulty`.

2. **State Transition:**
   - If we are computing `dp[i][k]`, it means we are determining the minimum difficulty for scheduling jobs up to the i-th job in `k` days.
   - For the last segment to end at job `i`, consider any reliable partitioning where the last segment starts from job `j` to `i`. Thus, for any `j < i`, `dp[i][k]` can be updated by using the maximum job difficulty from index `j` to `i`.

3. **Base Case:**
   - `dp[0][0] = 0` since no jobs scheduled in 0 days have 0 difficulty.
   - Other `dp` values could be initialized to a large number (`Integer.MAX_VALUE`) to signify impossible states initially.

4. **Fill the DP Table:**
   - Loop through the days and jobs to fill out the table according to the defined transition.

5. **Final Answer:**
   - If `dp[n][d]` remains `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, it indicates it's impossible to partition as required, otherwise it provides the result.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class JobSchedule {

    public int minDifficulty(int[] jobDifficulty, int d) {
        int n = jobDifficulty.length;
        
        // If jobs are fewer than days, it's impossible
        if (n < d) return -1;
        
        int[][] dp = new int[d + 1][n + 1];
        for (int[] row : dp) {
            Arrays.fill(row, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        }
        dp[0][0] = 0; // base case: no job assigned in 0 days

        for (int day = 1; day <= d; day++) {
            for (int i = day; i <= n; i++) {
                int maxJobDifficulty = 0;
                // Iterate backwards to find optimal partition
                for (int j = i; j >= day; j--) {
                    maxJobDifficulty = Math.max(maxJobDifficulty, jobDifficulty[j - 1]);
                    if (dp[day - 1][j - 1] != Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
                        dp[day][i] = Math.min(dp[day][i], dp[day - 1][j - 1] + maxJobDifficulty);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return dp[d][n];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JobSchedule js = new JobSchedule();
        int[] jobDifficulty = {6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1};
        int d = 2;
        System.out.println(js.minDifficulty(jobDifficulty, d)); // Output: 7
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this dynamic programming approach is `O(n^2 * d)`, where `n` is the length of `jobDifficulty`, and `d` is the number of days. This ensures every segment and days' combination is considered efficiently.

- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is `O(n * d)` for storing the DP table.
