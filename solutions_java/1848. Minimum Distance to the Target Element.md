[Leetcode 1848. Minimum Distance to the Target Element](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1848)
### Problem Statement

Leetcode problem 1848: "Minimum Distance to the Target Element"

Given an integer array `nums` and two integers `target` and `start`, find the minimum distance between `start` and any position `i` such that `nums[i] == target`.

The distance between two indices `i` and `j` is `|i - j|`, where `||` represents the absolute value function.

Return the minimum distance. If there is no such `i`, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What are the constraints for the length of the array `nums`?
   - **A:** Typically in Leetcode problems, the length of the array can be up to 10^5.

2. **Q:** What are the constraints for the values within the array?
   - **A:** The values in the array and the target can range from -1000 to 1000.

3. **Q:** What should be the output if no elements match the target?
   - **A:** In such case, return -1.

4. **Q:** Can `start` be out of the bounds of the array?
   - **A:** No, `start` is guaranteed to be within the bounds of the array.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to iterate through the array and look for all occurrences of `target`. For each occurrence, we'll calculate the distance to `start` and keep track of the minimum distance found.

1. Initialize a variable `minDistance` to `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.
2. Loop through the array `nums`:
   - If `nums[i]` equals `target`, calculate the distance `|i - start|`.
   - Update `minDistance` if the new calculated distance is smaller.
3. If `minDistance` remains `Integer.MAX_VALUE`, return `-1` (indicating no target was found).
4. Otherwise, return `minDistance`.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int getMinDistance(int[] nums, int target, int start) {
        int minDistance = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == target) {
                int distance = Math.abs(i - start);
                minDistance = Math.min(minDistance, distance);
            }
        }
        
        return minDistance == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : minDistance;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the array `nums`, because we are making a single pass over the array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we only use a fixed amount of additional space for storing variables like `minDistance` and `distance`.

This solution is efficient and conforms to Leetcode's typical constraints.
