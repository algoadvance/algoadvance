[Leetcode 2569. Handling Sum Queries After Update full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2569)
## Problem Statement
You are given two integer arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, both of size `n`, and an integer `m` representing the number of queries. Each query is represented by a tuple `(type, x, y)`:

1. If `type` is `1`, for each `i` in the range `[x, y]`, set `nums1[i]` to `nums1[i] + nums2[i]`.
2. If `type` is `2`, compute and return the sum of the array `nums1` after applying all the updates.

Implement the function `List<Integer> handleQueriesAfterUpdate(int[] nums1, int[] nums2, int[][] queries, int m)` to handle this task.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are `nums1` and `nums2` guaranteed to be of the same length?**
   - Yes, both arrays are of size `n`.
   
2. **Do all queries add elements in place or is immutability required?**
   - The task suggests that the updates should be applied directly to `nums1`.

3. **Should the intermediate results or only the final result be returned?**
   - Only the final sum of `nums1` after processing all queries should be returned.

4. **Can `y` in a query of type `1` exceed the length of the arrays?**
   - No, `x` and `y` will be valid indices within the length of `nums1` and `nums2`.

## Strategy
1. **Iterate through the queries:**
   - For `type = 1`: Update values in `nums1` from index `x` to `y` using the corresponding values in `nums2`.
   - For `type = 2`: Compute the sum of `nums1` after all updates and store the result.
   
2. **Return the result computed after all updates.**

## Time Complexity
- **Updates (type 1):** O(y - x + 1) per update, where processing might range from `O(1)` up to `O(n)`.
- **Sum computation (type 2):** O(n)

To improve efficiency for large number of operations, consider maintaining a continuous sum or segment tree if frequent updates and queries are required.

## Code
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> handleQueriesAfterUpdate(int[] nums1, int[] nums2, int[][] queries, int m) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int[] query : queries) {
            int type = query[0];
            int x = query[1];
            int y = query[2];
            
            if (type == 1) {
                for (int i = x; i <= y; i++) {
                    nums1[i] += nums2[i];
                }
            } else if (type == 2) {
                int sum = 0;
                for (int num : nums1) {
                    sum += num;
                }
                result.add(sum);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}

```

The provided code processes each query in a straightforward manner based on its type. While the current solution is simple, it's inefficient for frequent and large number of updates (type 1) operations. For large datasets, segment trees or Fenwick trees can be considered to manage updates and sum operations more efficiently.
