[Leetcode 223. Rectangle Area](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l223)
### Problem Statement
Given the coordinates of two rectilinear rectangles in a 2D plane, return the total area covered by the two rectangles.

Each rectangle is defined by its bottom-left and top-right coordinates as follows:
- Rectangle 1: `(A, B)` is the bottom-left corner and `(C, D)` is the top-right corner.
- Rectangle 2: `(E, F)` is the bottom-left corner and `(G, H)` is the top-right corner.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the coordinates always integers?**
   Yes, the coordinates are given as integers.
   
2. **Can the rectangles overlap?**
   Yes, the rectangles can overlap.

3. **What should be returned if there is no overlap?**
   The sum of the areas of both rectangles should be returned if there is no overlap.

4. **Can the rectangles be degenerate (i.e., form lines or points)?**
   Yes, but they will not contribute any positive area in such cases.

### Strategy
We need to follow these steps to solve the problem:
1. **Compute the area of both rectangles independently:**
   - Area of Rectangle 1: `(C - A) * (D - B)`
   - Area of Rectangle 2: `(G - E) * (H - F)`

2. **Calculate the overlap area:**
   - The overlap area is determined by the overlapping horizontal and vertical ranges between the two rectangles.
   - Horizontal overlap width: `max(0, min(C, G) - max(A, E))`
   - Vertical overlap height: `max(0, min(D, H) - max(B, F))`
   - Overlap area: Overlap width * Overlap height

3. **Sum the areas of the two rectangles and subtract the overlap area to get the total area.**

### Code
```java
public class RectangleArea {
    public int computeArea(int A, int B, int C, int D, int E, int F, int G, int H) {
        // Calculate the area of the first rectangle
        int area1 = (C - A) * (D - B);
        
        // Calculate the area of the second rectangle
        int area2 = (G - E) * (H - F);
        
        // Calculate the overlapping area
        int overlapWidth = Math.max(0, Math.min(C, G) - Math.max(A, E));
        int overlapHeight = Math.max(0, Math.min(D, H) - Math.max(B, F));
        int overlapArea = overlapWidth * overlapHeight;
        
        // Total area is the sum of the individual areas minus the overlapping part
        return area1 + area2 - overlapArea;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(1)** because all operations involved (min, max, and arithmetic) are performed in constant time.
