[Leetcode 1963. Minimum Number of Swaps to Make the String Balanced](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1963)
### Problem Statement:
You are given a 0-indexed string `s` of even length consisting of `(` and `)` characters only. A string is considered balanced if it contains no unmatched parentheses.

- For example, `()()` and `(())` are balanced, but `)(` and `()))` are not balanced.

You can swap any two characters of the string, potentially multiple times, to make the string balanced. Return the minimum number of swaps needed to make the string balanced.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Constraints and Input Validation**:
   - What are the constraints on the length of the string, `s`?
   - Should `s` always have an even length according to the problem statement?
   - Are there any specific restrictions on the characters of `s`?

2. **Behavior**:
   - Are we required to only swap adjacent characters, or can we swap any two characters in the string?
   - Is there a need to provide the sequence of swaps, or just the minimum number of swaps is sufficient?

### Strategy:

The problem is to make a given string balanced, requiring the minimum number of swaps. A straightforward approach involves these steps:

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Use a stack to keep track of unmatched `(` characters.
   - Use a counter to track the number of swaps needed.

2. **Scan through the String**:
   - Traverse the string character by character.
   - For each `(`, push it onto the stack.
   - For each `)`, check the stack:
     - If the stack is not empty, pop from the stack (indicating a matched pair).
     - If the stack is empty, increment the swap counter, because this `)` had no preceding `(` to match with. This means we encountered an excess closing bracket.

3. **Calculate Swaps**:
   - By the end of the string, if there are unmatched `(` in the stack, these will need to be matched with `)` via swapping.
   - The number of unmatched `(` should be balanced by an equal number of `)` from inappropriate positions, hence swaps are proportional to half of these mismatches.
  
### Time Complexity:
- The algorithm involves a single pass through the string, making it O(n) in time complexity.
- Space complexity is O(n) in the worst case due to the stack.

### Code:
Here is the Java implementation of the described strategy:

```java
public class MinimumSwapsToBalanceString {
    public int minSwaps(String s) {
        int imbalance = 0, maxImbalance = 0;
        
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (ch == '(') {
                imbalance++;
            } else {
                imbalance--;
            }
            
            // Track the maximum imbalance to compute swaps required
            maxImbalance = Math.max(maxImbalance, -imbalance);
        }
        
        // Swaps required is the ceiling of half the maximum imbalance
        return (maxImbalance + 1) / 2;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumSwapsToBalanceString solver = new MinimumSwapsToBalanceString();
        String s = "())(()";
        System.out.println("Minimum swaps needed: " + solver.minSwaps(s)); // Output: 1
    }
}
```

This should cover the essentials for this problem, ensuring any given string can be balanced with minimal swaps efficiently.
