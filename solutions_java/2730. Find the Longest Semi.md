[Leetcode 2730. Find the Longest Semi](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2730)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting of digits (0-9). A semi-repetitive substring is defined as a substring that contains at most one contiguous pair of repeated characters. Your task is to find the length of the longest semi-repetitive substring within the given string.

For example, in the string `122333`, `122` and `233` are valid semi-repetitive substrings but `1223` and `2233` are not because they have more than one contiguous pair of repeated characters.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the length of the string `s`?
   - Are there any constraints on the characters in the string?

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Should the function return only the length of the longest semi-repetitive substring, or should it also return the substring itself?
   
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - How should the function handle an empty string?
   - Are there any specific cases, such as all characters being the same?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach to efficiently keep track of substrings and their properties. This will allow us to maintain the longest semi-repetitive substring found during traversal of the string.

1. **Initialization:** 
   - Initialize two pointers `start` and `end` to mark the window of the current substring.
   - Use a variable `pair_count` to count the number of contiguous pairs of repeating characters in the current window.
   - Track the length of the longest semi-repetitive substring found.

2. **Window Expansion and Contraction:** 
   - Start expanding the window by moving the `end` pointer.
   - If a repetition is found, increment the `pair_count`.
   - If the `pair_count` exceeds 1 (more than one contiguous pair), move the `start` pointer to the right until the `pair_count` is reduced to 1 or less.
   - Update the maximum length whenever a valid window (semi-repetitive substring) is found.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If the string is empty, return 0.
   - Handle cases where all characters are the same, which may result in valid substrings of various lengths.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int longestSemiRepetitiveSubstring(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.length() == 0) return 0;

        int n = s.length();
        int maxLength = 0;
        int start = 0, pairCount = 0;

        for (int end = 1; end < n; end++) {
            if (s.charAt(end) == s.charAt(end - 1)) {
                pairCount++;
            }

            while (pairCount > 1) {
                if (s.charAt(start) == s.charAt(start + 1)) {
                    pairCount--;
                }
                start++;
            }

            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, end - start + 1);
        }

        return maxLength;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.longestSemiRepetitiveSubstring("52233")); // Expected output: 4
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because each character in the string is processed at most twice (once when expanding the window and once when contracting the window).

The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a fixed number of extra variables (not dependent on the input size).
