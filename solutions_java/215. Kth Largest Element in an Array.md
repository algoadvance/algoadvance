[Leetcode 215. Kth Largest Element in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l215)
### Problem Statement:
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the `k`th largest element in the array. Note that it is the `k`th largest element in the sorted order, not the `k`th distinct element.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [3,2,1,5,6,4], k = 2
Output: 5

Input: nums = [3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6], k = 4
Output: 4
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can `nums` contain negative numbers?
   - Yes, `nums` can contain negative numbers.
2. Can `nums` be empty?
   - No, according to the problem's constraints, `nums` will have at least one element.
3. What are the constraints on `k`?
   - `k` is always valid, which means `1 <= k <= nums.length`.

### Strategy:
1. **Sorting Approach:**
   - Sort the array in descending order.
   - Pick the element at index `k-1`.

2. **Usage of a Min-Heap:**
   - Use a Min-Heap (priority queue) to manage the size of the heap to `k`.
   - Iterate through each element in the array, maintaining a heap of size `k`.
   - The root of the heap will be the `k`th largest element.
   
3. **Quickselect Algorithm:**
   - Use a selection algorithm to find the `k`th largest element without full sorting.
   - This is similar to the quicksort algorithm, but only works on one partition.

### Code:
Let's implement the Min-Heap approach, which provides a good balance between simplicity and efficiency.

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public class KthLargestElementInArray {
    public int findKthLargest(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Create a Min-Heap
        PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(k);
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            minHeap.add(num);
            // If the heap size exceeds k, remove the smallest element
            if (minHeap.size() > k) {
                minHeap.poll();
            }
        }
        
        // The root of the heap is the k-th largest element
        return minHeap.peek();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        KthLargestElementInArray solution = new KthLargestElementInArray();
        int[] nums1 = {3,2,1,5,6,4};
        int[] nums2 = {3,2,3,1,2,4,5,5,6};
        
        System.out.println(solution.findKthLargest(nums1, 2)); // Output: 5
        System.out.println(solution.findKthLargest(nums2, 4)); // Output: 4
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Min-Heap Approach:**
  - Building the heap takes `O(k)` time.
  - For the remaining `n-k` elements, each insertion and removal operation in the heap takes `O(log k)` time.
  - Thus, the total time complexity is `O(n log k)`.

This method is efficient and scales well for larger arrays compared to full sorting, which would take `O(n log n)`.
