[Leetcode 2233. Maximum Product After K Increments](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2233)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. In one operation, you can pick any index `i` where `0 <= i < nums.length` and increment `nums[i]` by `1`. Return the maximum product you can obtain after performing `k` increment operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of inputs:**
   - What is the range of values for elements in `nums`?
   - What is the range of values for `k`?

2. **Constraints:**
   - Can the array have negative numbers or zero?
   - Are there any constraints on the size of the array `nums`?

3. **Guarantees:**
   - Is it guaranteed that there will be at least one element in `nums`?

### Strategy

To maximize the product after `k` increments, the best strategy is to increment the smallest element in the array. This will have the most significant impact on increasing the product. Therefore, the optimal approach involves repeatedly finding and incrementing the smallest element.

Steps:
1. Use a min-heap to efficiently get the smallest element.
2. Increment this smallest element and push it back to the heap.
3. Repeat the above steps for `k` increments.
4. After `k` increments, compute the product of elements in the heap.

### Implementation

Here is the implementation in Java:

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public class Solution {

    public int maximumProduct(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Create a min-heap
        PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
        
        // Add all elements of 'nums' to the min-heap
        for (int num : nums) {
            minHeap.add(num);
        }
        
        // Perform k increments on the smallest element in the heap
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            int smallestElement = minHeap.poll();
            smallestElement += 1;
            minHeap.add(smallestElement);
        }
        
        // Calculate the product of all elements in the heap
        long product = 1;
        while (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
            product = (product * minHeap.poll()) % 1_000_000_007;
        }
        
        // Return the product as integer
        return (int) product;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Heap Operations:**
   - Adding elements to the heap: \(O(n \log n)\)
   - For each increment, polling from and adding to the heap: \(O(k \log n)\)

2. **Total Time Complexity:**
   - Building the initial heap: \(O(n \log n)\)
   - Performing `k` increments: \(O(k \log n)\)

Overall, the time complexity is \(O((n + k) \log n)\).

This approach ensures that we are always incrementing the smallest element, thereby maximizing the final product efficiently.
