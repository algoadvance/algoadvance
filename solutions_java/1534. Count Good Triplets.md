[Leetcode 1534. Count Good Triplets full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1534)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `arr`, and three integers `a`, `b` and `c`. You need to count the number of good triplets. A triplet `(arr[i], arr[j], arr[k])` is good if the following conditions are true:

1. `0 <= i < j < k < arr.length`
2. `|arr[i] - arr[j]| <= a`
3. `|arr[j] - arr[k]| <= b`
4. `|arr[i] - arr[k]| <= c`

Return the number of good triplets.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the length of the array and the values of a, b, and c?**
   - Constraints:
     - `3 <= arr.length <= 100`
     - `0 <= arr[i] <= 1000`
     - `0 <= a, b, c <= 1000`

2. **Can the array have duplicate values?**
   - Yes, it can.

3. **What should be returned if no good triplets are found?**
   - Return `0`.

### Strategy

1. **Brute Force Approach:**
   - The simplest way to solve this problem is by checking every possible triplet in the array using three nested loops.
   - For each triplet, check if it satisfies all the given conditions.
   - If it does, increment the counter.
  
2. **Optimized Approach:**
   - Given the constraints (array length up to 100), the brute force approach is feasible as it results in \(O(n^3)\) time complexity.
   - Therefore, using three nested loops to iterate through all possible triplets should work within the given limits.

### Code

Here’s a straightforward implementation in Java using the brute force method:

```java
public class CountGoodTriplets {
    public int countGoodTriplets(int[] arr, int a, int b, int c) {
        int count = 0;
        int n = arr.length;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 2; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n - 1; j++) {
                for (int k = j + 1; k < n; k++) {
                    if (Math.abs(arr[i] - arr[j]) <= a 
                        && Math.abs(arr[j] - arr[k]) <= b 
                        && Math.abs(arr[i] - arr[k]) <= c) {
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CountGoodTriplets solution = new CountGoodTriplets();
        int[] arr = {3, 0, 1, 1, 9, 7};
        int a = 7, b = 2, c = 3;
        System.out.println(solution.countGoodTriplets(arr, a, b, c)); // Output should be 4
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n^3)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array. Given the constraints, this is acceptable.

- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since we are using only a few extra variables to store the count and index values.

This approach efficiently checks all possible triplets to ensure they meet the given conditions. Even though it’s a cubic time complexity brute force solution, it is sufficient for the problem constraints.
