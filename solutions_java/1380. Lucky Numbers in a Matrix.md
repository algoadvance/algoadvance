[Leetcode 1380. Lucky Numbers in a Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1380)
### Problem Statement
Given an `m x n` matrix of distinct numbers, return all lucky numbers in the matrix in any order.

A lucky number is an **element** of the matrix that is the minimum element in its row and the maximum in its column.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Can the matrix have any negative numbers? 
   - What is the maximum size of the matrix?
   - Will the matrix always be non-empty?

2. **Output Format:**
   - Should the result be a list of integers?
   
For simplicity, let's assume the matrix is always non-empty and contains only distinct integers.

### Strategy
To find the lucky numbers, we'll follow these steps:

1. **Identify Minimums in Rows:**
   - Traverse each row to find the minimum value in each row and store their positions (row, column).

2. **Check Maximums in Columns:**
   - For each position (row, column) identified as a minimum in its row, verify whether it's the maximum in its respective column.

3. **Compilation of Results:**
   - Gather all the elements that satisfy both conditions and prepare the final result list.

### Code
Let's implement the strategy in Java:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class LuckyNumbersInMatrix {
    public List<Integer> luckyNumbers (int[][] matrix) {
        int m = matrix.length;
        int n = matrix[0].length;
        List<Integer> luckyNumbers = new ArrayList<>();

        // Step 1: Identify the minimum elements in each row
        int[] minRow = new int[m];
        int[] minRowColIndex = new int[m];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (matrix[i][j] < min) {
                    min = matrix[i][j];
                    minRowColIndex[i] = j;
                }
            }
            minRow[i] = min;
        }

        // Step 2: Check if these minimum elements are the maximum in their respective columns
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            int col = minRowColIndex[i];
            int minValue = minRow[i];
            boolean isMaxInCol = true;
            
            for (int k = 0; k < m; k++) {
                if (matrix[k][col] > minValue) {
                    isMaxInCol = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            
            if (isMaxInCol) {
                luckyNumbers.add(minValue);
            }
        }

        return luckyNumbers;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Finding minimums in each row:** \(O(m \times n)\)
- **Checking maximum in columns:** \(O(m \times m)\) for each row minimum. Since there are \(m\) rows, in the worst case we can decide all \(m\) rows, giving us \(O(m \times n + m \times m) = O(m \times (n + m))\)

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(m \times (n + m))\), which simplifies to \(O(m \times n + m^2)\). For large \(m\) and \(n\), this will be dominated by the \(m \times n\) term.

The space complexity is \(O(m)\), needed for storing the minimum elements and their column indexes.
