[Leetcode 2250. Count Number of Rectangles Containing Each Point](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2250)
### Problem Statement
Given a list of axis-aligned rectangles and a list of points, determine how many rectangles contain each point. A rectangle is represented as a list of two integers `[li, wi]`, where `li` is the length of the rectangle and `wi` is the width of the rectangle. A point is represented by `[x, y]`. A rectangle contains a point if `x <= li` and `y <= wi`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the maximum number of rectangles and points that could be given?
2. Can the coordinates of points and sides of rectangles be negative?
3. Are the points unique in the list of points, and can the rectangles repeat?

Based on the problem statement from LeetCode, we will assume reasonable constraints:
1. Generally, for competitive programming problems, you can have up to \(10^5\) rectangles or points.
2. Coordinates can be zero or positive.
3. Points and rectangles can have duplicates.

### Strategy
1. Sort the list of rectangles based on their width.
2. For each point, determine how many rectangles contain the point.
3. Iterate over each point and use a binary search to efficiently find the number of valid rectangles. Since we sorted rectangles by width, then only lengths need to be checked in a limited window.

### Code
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int[] countRectangles(int[][] rectangles, int[][] points) {
        Arrays.sort(rectangles, (a, b) -> a[1] - b[1]); // Sort by width (wi)

        int[][] sortedPoints = new int[points.length][3];
        for (int i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
            sortedPoints[i][0] = points[i][0];
            sortedPoints[i][1] = points[i][1];
            sortedPoints[i][2] = i; // Store original index
        }
        
        Arrays.sort(sortedPoints, (a, b) -> a[1] - b[1]); // Sort by y (y-coordinate of the point)

        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> lengthMap = new HashMap<>();

        int idx = 0;
        int[] result = new int[points.length];
        
        for (int[] point : sortedPoints) {
            while (idx < rectangles.length && rectangles[idx][1] <= point[1]) {
                int length = rectangles[idx][0];
                lengthMap.putIfAbsent(length, new ArrayList<>());
                lengthMap.get(length).add(rectangles[idx][1]);
                idx++;
            }
            
            int count = 0;
            for (int length : lengthMap.keySet()) {
                if (length >= point[0]) {
                    count += lengthMap.get(length).size();
                }
            }
            
            result[point[2]] = count;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Sorting the rectangles and points by their widths will take \(O(R \log R + P \log P)\), where \(R\) is the number of rectangles and \(P\) is the number of points.
- Inserting rectangles into `lengthMap` and querying it has an overall complexity of \(O(R + P \cdot L)\), where \(L\) is the number of lengths that are unique across all rectangles. In the worst case, this could be \(\min(R, P) \cdot R\).
- Assuming a balanced input distribution, this approach should be efficient for competitive constraints.

Combining these, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is approximately \(O((R + P) \log R + P L)\).
