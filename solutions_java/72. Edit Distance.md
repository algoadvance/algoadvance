[Leetcode 72. Edit Distance](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l72)
## Problem Statement

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return the minimum number of operations required to convert `word1` to `word2`.

You have the following three operations permitted on a word:

1. Insert a character
2. Delete a character
3. Replace a character

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the strings contain any type of characters including spaces and special symbols?
2. What is the maximum possible length of the given strings `word1` and `word2`?
3. Should we consider the case sensitivity of the characters? For example, is `a` different from `A`?
4. Is there any preference for one type of operation over another or all operations are considered equally costly?

## Strategy

This problem can be effectively solved using Dynamic Programming (DP). We will set up a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the edit distance between the first `i` characters of `word1` and the first `j` characters of `word2`.

### Steps:
1. **Initialization**: Initialize a matrix `dp` of size `(len(word1) + 1) x (len(word2) + 1)`.
2. **Base Cases**:
   - `dp[0][j] = j`: To convert an empty `word1` to the first `j` characters of `word2`, we need `j` insertions.
   - `dp[i][0] = i`: To convert the first `i` characters of `word1` to an empty `word2`, we need `i` deletions.
3. **DP Transition**:
   - If the characters match (`word1[i-1] == word2[j-1]`), then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`.
   - If they donâ€™t match, consider the following:
     - **Insert** a character (move `j-1`): `dp[i][j-1] + 1`
     - **Delete** a character (move `i-1`): `dp[i-1][j] + 1`
     - **Replace** a character (move both `i-1` and `j-1`): `dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`
   - Choose the minimum of these three values.

### Code

```java
public class EditDistance {
    
    public int minDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        int m = word1.length();
        int n = word2.length();
        
        // Create a DP array
        int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];
        
        // Initialize the base cases
        for (int i = 0; i <= m; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = i; // Min operations to convert to empty word2
        }
        
        for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = j; // Min operations to convert from empty word1
        }
        
        // Fill the DP array
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                if (word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    // Characters match, inherit the previous value
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                } else {
                    // Characters do not match, consider all operations
                    int insert = dp[i][j - 1] + 1;
                    int delete = dp[i - 1][j] + 1;
                    int replace = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(insert, Math.min(delete, replace));
                }
            }
        }
        
        // The answer is the last cell of the array
        return dp[m][n];
    }
}

```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` is the length of `word1` and `n` is the length of `word2`. This is because we have a nested loop that iterates over each cell in the DP table.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) for storing the DP table.
