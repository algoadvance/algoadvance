[Leetcode 472. Concatenated Words](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l472)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of strings `words` (each of which consists of lowercase English letters), you need to determine all the strings in the words list that are concatenated by at least two shorter words from the same list.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the words guaranteed to be unique in the list?**
   - Yes, each word in the provided list is unique.
2. **Can words be formed by the same word multiple times?**
   - No, a word cannot be formed by repeating itself; it should be formed by at least two distinct shorter words from the list.
3. **What is the range of the input size?**
   - The number of words and the length of each word can be significant, potentially up to thousands.
4. **Should we consider the word order?**
   - No, the order does not matter, but we should check all possible concatenations.

### Strategy
1. **Trie Construction:** We can use a Trie (prefix tree) to store all the words. This will help us efficiently search and segment words.
2. **DFS with Memoization:** For each word, use Depth-First Search (DFS) to check if it can be segmented into two or more shorter words that exist in the Trie.
3. **Memoization:** Use a memoization technique to cache intermediate results to avoid redundant calculations and improve efficiency.

### Code
Here is the Java code to solve the problem:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<String> findAllConcatenatedWordsInADict(String[] words) {
        // Edge case: if the words array is empty or has single word
        if (words == null || words.length == 0) return new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Create a set to store all the words
        Set<String> wordSet = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(words));
        
        // Memoization map to store already computed results
        Map<String, Boolean> memo = new HashMap<>();
        
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (String word : words) {
            if (canForm(word, wordSet, memo)) {
                result.add(word);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    private boolean canForm(String word, Set<String> wordSet, Map<String, Boolean> memo) {
        // Check in memo first
        if (memo.containsKey(word)) return memo.get(word);
        
        // Try splitting the word into two parts
        for (int i = 1; i < word.length(); i++) {
            String prefix = word.substring(0, i);
            String suffix = word.substring(i);
            
            if (wordSet.contains(prefix) 
                && (wordSet.contains(suffix) || canForm(suffix, wordSet, memo))) {
                memo.put(word, true);
                return true;
            }
        }
        
        memo.put(word, false);
        return false;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Trie Construction:** O(n * k), where `n` is the number of words and `k` is the average length of the words.
2. **DFS with Memoization:**
   - Each word requires a DFS traversal, and in the worst case, each split might lead to more splits leading the complexity to be exponential O(L^2), where `L` is the length of the word.
   - However, due to memoization, the actual runtime will be significantly reduced as results are reused, making this approach feasible for reasonably sized inputs.

This approach ensures that we can efficiently find all concatenated words in the given list.
