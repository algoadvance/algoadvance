[Leetcode 599. Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l599)
Sure! Let's break down the problem-solving process for LeetCode problem 599, "Minimum Index Sum of Two Lists."

### Problem Statement:
Given two lists `list1` and `list2` of strings, find the common strings with the least index sum. If there is a tie, output all the strings with the minimum index sum.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Are there any constraints on the length of the lists?
2. Are there any constraints regarding the contents of the lists (e.g., no duplicate strings within a single list)?
3. Should the output order matter if there are multiple strings with the same minimum index sum?

Presuming the following:
- The lists are not excessively long (manageable within typical constraints).
- Each list contains unique strings.
- If there are multiple strings with the same minimum index sum, their order in the output list does not matter.

### Strategy:
1. Create a map to store the indices of the elements in `list1`.
2. Iterate through `list2` and for each string, check if it exists in `list1`.
3. Calculate the index sum for common strings.
4. Track the minimum index sum and update a list of resulting strings when you find a smaller or equal index sum with a common string.
5. Return the list of common strings with the smallest index sum.

### Code:
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public String[] findRestaurant(String[] list1, String[] list2) {
        // Step 1: Create a map for list1 to store the value and its index
        Map<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < list1.length; i++) {
            map.put(list1[i], i);
        }
        
        // Step 2: Initialize the minimum index sum to a large value
        int minIndexSum = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();

        // Step 3: Traverse list2 and find common strings with minimum index sum
        for (int j = 0; j < list2.length; j++) {
            if (map.containsKey(list2[j])) {
                int indexSum = j + map.get(list2[j]);
                if (indexSum < minIndexSum) {
                    result.clear();
                    result.add(list2[j]);
                    minIndexSum = indexSum;
                } else if (indexSum == minIndexSum) {
                    result.add(list2[j]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result.toArray(new String[result.size()]);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        String[] list1 = {"Shogun", "Tapioca Express", "Burger King", "KFC"};
        String[] list2 = {"Piatti", "The Grill at Torrey Pines", "Hungry Hunter Steakhouse", "Shogun"};
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(sol.findRestaurant(list1, list2))); // Output: ["Shogun"]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity for this solution is \(O(n + m)\), where \(n\) is the length of `list1` and \(m\) is the length of `list2`. This is because we traverse both lists at most once:
- Constructing the map from `list1`: \(O(n)\)
- Traversing `list2` to find the common strings and calculating index sums: \(O(m)\)
