[Leetcode 1535. Find the Winner of an Array Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1535)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `arr` of distinct integers and an integer `k`.

A game will be played between the first two elements of the array (i.e., `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`). In each round of the game, we compare `arr[0]` with `arr[1]`. The larger integer wins and remains at the position `arr[0]`, and the smaller integer moves to the end of the array. The game ends when an integer wins `k` consecutive rounds.

Return the integer that will win the game.

If there is no winner after finishing all rounds, the largest element in the array is the winner.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: arr = [2,1,3,5,4,6,7], k = 2
Output: 5
Explanation: Let's see the rounds of the game:
Round 1: arr = [2,1,3,5,4,6,7], player `2` wins, `arr` becomes [2,3,5,4,6,7,1]
Round 2: arr = [2,3,5,4,6,7,1], player `3` wins, `arr` becomes [3,5,4,6,7,1,2]
Round 3: arr = [3,5,4,6,7,1,2], player `5` wins, `arr` becomes [5,4,6,7,1,2,3]
Round 4: arr = [5,4,6,7,1,2,3], player `5` wins (for the 2nd time), `arr` becomes [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]
Since `5` won `2` consecutive rounds, it is the answer.
```

## Clarifying Questions
- Are there any constraints on the size of the array or the value of its elements? 
- Should we assume the input always meets the problem constraints (e.g., `k` and `arr` are non-negative integers)?
- If `k` is greater than the length of the array, what should be the behavior?

## Strategy
1. Use a loop to simulate each round of the game.
2. Maintain a counter to keep track of an integer's consecutive wins.
3. Terminate the loop and return the winning integer once it wins `k` consecutive rounds.
4. If no integer wins `k` consecutive rounds, return the maximum integer in the array.

## Code
```java
public class FindTheWinner {
    public static int getWinner(int[] arr, int k) {
        int currentWinner = arr[0];
        int consecutiveWins = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > currentWinner) {
                currentWinner = arr[i];
                consecutiveWins = 1; // reset wins since currentWinner is new
            } else {
                consecutiveWins++;
            }
            if (consecutiveWins == k) {
                return currentWinner;
            }
        }

        return currentWinner; // if no one won 'k' consecutive rounds, return the max element
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {2, 1, 3, 5, 4, 6, 7};
        int k = 2;
        System.out.println(getWinner(arr, k)); // Output: 5
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array. This is because, in the worst-case scenario, we might need to iterate through the entire array to find the winner.
- The space complexity is `O(1)` since we use only a few extra variables and do not use any additional data structures that scale with the input size.
