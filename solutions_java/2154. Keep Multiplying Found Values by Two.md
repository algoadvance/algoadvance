[Leetcode 2154. Keep Multiplying Found Values by Two](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2154)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. You are also given an integer `original` which is guaranteed to be one of the elements in `nums`.

You should do the following operation as long as you can:

- If `original` is in `nums`, multiply it by two (i.e., set `original = 2 * original`).

Return the final value of `original`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [5, 3, 6, 1, 12], original = 3
Output: 24
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [2, 7, 9], original = 4
Output: 4
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What is the size limit of the input array `nums`?
   **A:** There is no explicit size limit given, but we may assume typical constraints like up to `10^4` elements.
   
2. **Q:** Is `nums` always a non-empty array?
   **A:** Yes, it's stated in the problem description.

3. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the values within `nums`?
   **A:** The problem doesn't specify, but typically array elements can range from `-10^4` to `10^4`.

4. **Q:** Can `original` be a negative number?
   **A:** Technically yes, but it's mentioned that `original` is guaranteed to be one of the elements in `nums`.

## Strategy

1. We'll use a `HashSet` to store the elements of `nums` for O(1) average-time complexity checks to see if `original` is in `nums`.

2. We iterate while `original` is found in the set. Every time it's found, we multiply `original` by 2.

3. We continue this process until `original` no longer exists in `nums`.

4. Finally, we return the value of `original`.

## Code

```java
import java.util.HashSet;

public class Solution {
    public int findFinalValue(int[] nums, int original) {
        // Step 1: Create a HashSet from the elements of nums
        HashSet<Integer> numSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            numSet.add(num);
        }
        
        // Step 2: Multiply 'original' by 2 until it's no longer in the set
        while (numSet.contains(original)) {
            original *= 2;
        }
        
        // Step 3: Return the final value of 'original'
        return original;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **HashSet Creation:** O(n) where n is the number of elements in `nums` (each insertion is O(1) amortized time).
2. **Checking in HashSet:** In the worst case, we might check log(N) times (each check O(1)).

    - Suppose `original` starts with the minimum element and needs to be doubled until a maximum possible value within the range of given constraints (like say `32,768`).
  
    - Max multiplications needed will be bounded by the number of bits, usually less than or equal to 14 (`log2 (10^4)`).

3. **Overall Complexity:** O(n)

- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for storing elements in the `HashSet`.

This method ensures both time and space efficiency while solving the problem effectively.
