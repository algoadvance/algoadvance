[Leetcode 2517. Maximum Tastiness of Candy Basket](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2517)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `price` where `price[i]` represents the price of the `i-th` candy. You are also given an integer `k`. Your task is to select `k` candies from the array such that the difference between the price of the most expensive candy and the price of the cheapest candy is minimized. Return the minimum difference.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are all elements in the `price` array positive integers?
2. What is the range of `price.length` (number of candies) and `k`?
3. Can we assume that `k` is always less than or equal to the length of the `price` array?

## Strategy

To minimize the difference between the highest and the lowest priced candies among the selected `k` candies, we can use the following strategy:

1. **Sort the Price Array**: Start by sorting the array. Once sorted, any subarray of length `k` will have elements in a continuous segment. The best segment will be the one where the maximum difference between the first and last element of the subarray is minimized.
2. **Sliding Window Approach**: Use a sliding window to consider subarrays of length `k`. The difference between the maximum and minimum elements of each subarray will be the difference between the last and the first elements of the sliding window.
3. **Track the Minimum Difference**: Track the smallest difference obtained from all the sliding windows of size `k`.

## Code
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int maximumTastiness(int[] price, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(price); // Step 1: Sort the price array
        
        int minDifference = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        // Step 2: Use sliding window to find the minimum difference
        for (int i = 0; i <= price.length - k; i++) {
            int currentDifference = price[i + k - 1] - price[i];
            minDifference = Math.min(minDifference, currentDifference);
        }

        return minDifference;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] price = {3, 1, 4, 1, 5, 9, 2, 6};
        int k = 3;
        System.out.println(sol.maximumTastiness(price, k)); // Expected output is 1
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting the array**: \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array.
- **Sliding window comparison**: \(O(n)\) because we slide the window over the array once.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n) + O(n) = O(n \log n)\).
