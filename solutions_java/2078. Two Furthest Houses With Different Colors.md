[Leetcode 2078. Two Furthest Houses With Different Colors](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2078)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `colors` where `colors[i]` is the color of the `i-th` house. Return the maximum distance between two houses with different colors.

**Example:**
```
Input: colors = [1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2]
Output: 5
Explanation: The furthest two houses with different colors are house 0 (color 1) and house 5 (color 2), which are 5 units apart.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What is the range of the length of the array?
   - **A:** The length of the array `colors` can range from 2 to 100.

2. **Q:** What is the range of the values in the array?
   - **A:** The values in the array represent colors and can range from 0 to 100.

3. **Q:** Can there be multiple colors being the same in the array?
   - **A:** Yes, there can be multiple occurrences of the same color.

4. **Q:** Are the indices 0-based?
   - **A:** Yes, the problem assumes a 0-based index for the array.

## Strategy

1. We need to find the maximum distance between two houses with different colors.
2. We will explore two main directions:
   - From the start of the array, find the furthest house with a different color from the last house.
   - From the end of the array, find the furthest house with a different color from the first house.
3. The maximum of these two distances will be our answer.

## Code

```java
public class FurthestHouses {
    public int maxDistance(int[] colors) {
        int n = colors.length;
        int maxDistance = 0;
        
        // Check distance from the first house
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (colors[i] != colors[0]) {
                maxDistance = Math.max(maxDistance, i);
                break;
            }
        }

        // Check distance from the last house
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (colors[i] != colors[n - 1]) {
                maxDistance = Math.max(maxDistance, n - 1 - i);
                break;
            }
        }

        return maxDistance;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FurthestHouses fh = new FurthestHouses();
        int[] colors = {1, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2};
        System.out.println(fh.maxDistance(colors)); // Output: 5
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the array `colors`.
- We make a linear pass through the array twice, but since itâ€™s within constant-time operations, the overall complexity remains linear.

By following this strategy, we ensure that we cover all edge cases and obtain the correct maximum distance efficiently.
