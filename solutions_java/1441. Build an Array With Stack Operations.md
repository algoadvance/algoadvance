[Leetcode 1441. Build an Array With Stack Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1441)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `target` and an integer `n`. In each iteration, you are required to use the following stack operations:

- "Push": Append the number to the array `built`.
- "Pop": Remove the last element from the array `built`.

You need to build the array `target` using the stack operations, and also track the operations performed. Each operation should be a string "Push" or "Pop". The set of operations should build the array `target` from an empty array `built` in the order given in `target`.

Return a list of the operations that will build the array `target`.

### Example

**Input:**
```plaintext
target = [1, 3]
n = 3
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
["Push", "Push", "Pop", "Push"]
```

**Explanation:**
```plaintext
Read number 1 and do Push (built = [1])
Read number 2 and do Push and Pop (built = [1])
Read number 3 and do Push (built = [1, 3])
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Boundary conditions:** What are the possible values of `target` and `n`?
    - `1 <= target.length <= 100`
    - `1 <= target[i] <= 100` and all elements of `target` are distinct.
    - `1 <= n <= 100`
   
2. **Order:** Does the order in which elements are pushed and popped matter?
    - Yes, the `built` array must match the `target` in sequence.

3. **Duplicates:** Can `target` contain duplicates?
    - No, it's given that all elements in `target` are distinct.

### Strategy

1. Initialize an empty list `operations` to track the sequence of operations.
2. Initialize an empty list `built` to simulate the array being built using stack operations.
3. Iterate through integers from 1 to `n`.
    - If the current integer is in `target`, append "Push" to `operations` and add the number to `built`.
    - If the current integer is not in `target`, append both "Push" and "Pop" to `operations` to simulate pushing and immediately popping the number from `built`.
    - Stop once all elements of `target` are in `built`.

### Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public List<String> buildArray(int[] target, int n) {
        List<String> operations = new ArrayList<>();
        
        int targetIndex = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (targetIndex == target.length) break;
            operations.add("Push");
            if (target[targetIndex] == i) {
                targetIndex++;
            } else {
                operations.add("Pop");
            }
        }
        
        return operations;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The loop runs from 1 to `n`, thus O(n). The operations inside the loop take constant time, so the overall time complexity is O(n).
- **Space Complexity:** We use extra space to store the list `operations`, which can store up to 2 * `n` operations (in the worst case where every push is followed by a pop). Thus, the space complexity is O(n).
