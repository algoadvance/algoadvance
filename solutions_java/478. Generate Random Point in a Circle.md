[Leetcode 478. Generate Random Point in a Circle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l478)
## Problem Statement
You have a circle with a radius `radius` and a center at the origin `(0, 0)`. Implement the `Solution` class:

- `Solution(double radius, double x_center, double y_center)` Initializes the object with the radius of the circle `radius` and the position of the center `x_center` and `y_center`.
- `double[] randPoint()` Returns a random point inside the circle. A point on the circumference of the circle is considered to be in the circle. The answer is returned as an array `[x, y]`.

### Example:
``` 
Input:
["Solution", "randPoint", "randPoint", "randPoint"]
[[1.0, 0.0, 0.0], [], [], []]
Output:
[null, [-0.02493, -0.38077], [0.82314, 0.38945], [-0.36573, 0.17248]]

Explanation:
Solution solution = new Solution(1.0, 0.0, 0.0);
solution.randPoint(); // return a random point in the circle
solution.randPoint(); // return a random point in the circle
solution.randPoint(); // return a random point in the circle
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the center always at the origin?** No, the center can be anywhere, but typically it may often start at the origin for simplicity.
2. **Are there any constraints on the radius?** Radius is always positive.
3. **Is there a requirement for the distribution to be uniform?** Yes, the point generation inside the circle should be uniform.

## Strategy
1. **Random Point Generation Approach:**
   - To uniformly distribute the points inside a circle, we use polar coordinates where we randomly generate the angle `theta` and radius `r`.
   - Angle `theta` can be uniformly selected from `[0, 2*pi)`.
   - Radius `r` needs to be scaled correctly to ensure uniform distribution; hence, we use a random number in `[0, 1]` and take its square root to avoid clustering towards the center.

2. **Converting Polar to Cartesian Coordinates:**
   - Convert the generated polar coordinates `(r, theta)` to Cartesian coordinates `(x, y)` using the formula:
     - \( x = r \cdot \cos(\theta) \)
     - \( y = r \cdot \sin(\theta) \)

3. **Adjust for Circle's Center:**
   - Offset the generated `(x, y)` by the circle's center `(x_center, y_center)`.

## Code
```java
import java.util.Random;

public class Solution {
    private double radius;
    private double x_center;
    private double y_center;
    private Random rand;

    public Solution(double radius, double x_center, double y_center) {
        this.radius = radius;
        this.x_center = x_center;
        this.y_center = y_center;
        this.rand = new Random();
    }

    public double[] randPoint() {
        double theta = 2 * Math.PI * rand.nextDouble();
        double r = Math.sqrt(rand.nextDouble()) * radius;
        double x = r * Math.cos(theta) + x_center;
        double y = r * Math.sin(theta) + y_center;
        return new double[] {x, y};
    }
}

```

## Time Complexity
- **Initialization (`Solution` Constructor):** O(1)
- **Generating a Random Point (`randPoint` Method):** O(1)

**Explanation:** 
- The constructor simply initializes the class variables which is done in constant time.
- The `randPoint` method involves generating random numbers, calculating trigonometric functions, and performing arithmetic operations, all of which are constant time operations.
