[Leetcode 3090. Maximum Length Substring With Two Occurrences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3090)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string, and you are required to find the maximum length of the substring that contains exactly two distinct occurrences of the same character (that is, one character appears at least twice).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the length of the string or the characters it can contain?
   
   - **Assumption**: The length of the string is between 1 and 10^5, and it consists of lowercase English letters.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - A string with all unique characters (e.g., "abcdef").
   - A string where one character is repeated many times (e.g., "aaaaa").
   
3. **Output Format**: Should we return the length of such a substring, or the actual substring itself?
   
   - **Assumption**: We are to return the maximum length of the substring.

### Strategy

1. **Track Character Positions**: Use a HashMap to store the positions of each character.
2. **Iterate through Characters**: As we iterate through the string, update the positions of each character in the HashMap.
3. **Calculate Distances**: For each character that appears more than once, calculate the distance between the first and last occurrence.
4. **Update Maximum Length**: Keep track of the maximum length found.

### Approach

1. **Initialize a HashMap** to store character positions and another variable to track the maximum length.
2. **Iterate through the string** to populate/update the HashMap (store the first and last position of each character).
3. **Compute Maximum Length**: For each character in the HashMap, compute the distance between the first and last occurrence and update the maximum length accordingly.
4. **Return the Maximum Length** found.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class MaxLengthSubstringTwoOccurrences {
    public static int maxLengthSubstring(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.length() == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        HashMap<Character, Integer[]> charPositions = new HashMap<>();
        int maxLength = 0;

        // Populate the HashMap with character positions.
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char currentChar = s.charAt(i);
            if (!charPositions.containsKey(currentChar)) {
                charPositions.put(currentChar, new Integer[] {i, i});
            } else {
                charPositions.get(currentChar)[1] = i;
            }
        }

        // Calculate the maximum length.
        for (Integer[] positions : charPositions.values()) {
            if (positions[0] != positions[1]) {  // The character has appeared more than once.
                int length = positions[1] - positions[0] + 1;
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, length);
            }
        }

        return maxLength;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String testString = "ababc";
        System.out.println("Maximum Length: " + maxLengthSubstring(testString));  // Output should be 5.
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string. We make a single pass over the input string to populate the HashMap and another pass over the HashMap entries to compute the maximum length.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` auxiliary space for the character positions, but with the added space for the HashMap, it becomes `O(k)`, where `k` is the number of distinct characters (at most 26 for lowercase English letters).
