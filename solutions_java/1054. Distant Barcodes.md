## Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 1054: Distant Barcodes

In a warehouse, there is a row of barcodes, where the `i-th` barcode is `barcodes[i]`.

Rearrange the barcodes so that no two adjacent barcodes are equal. You may return any answer and it is guaranteed an answer exists.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: barcodes = [1,1,1,2,2,2]
Output: [2,1,2,1,2,1]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: barcodes = [1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3]
Output: [1,3,1,3,1,2,1,2]
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= barcodes.length <= 10000`
- `1 <= barcodes[i] <= 10000`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the barcodes contain more than one type of barcode?**
   Yes, the problem assumes that there will be multiple types of barcodes.

2. **Is there a specific order in which the barcodes should be rearranged?**
   No specific order is mentioned, as long as no two adjacent barcodes are the same.

## Strategy

### Approach
1. **Count Frequency:**
   Use a frequency map to count the occurrence of each barcode.
   
2. **Max-Heap:**
   Use a max-heap (priority queue) to always pick the barcode with the highest frequency. This helps to arrange the barcodes in a way that minimizes the chance of having two adjacent equal barcodes.

3. **Rearrange Barcodes:**
   - Place the most frequent barcode and then the next most frequent until the heap is empty.
   - Use a temporary list to store barcodes that have not been placed back into the heap yet.

4. **Handling Special Case:**
   - If placing the most frequent barcode again would cause two adjacent identical barcodes, temporarily put it aside and pick the next one.
   - Once the next barcode is placed, push back the temporarily kept barcode.

### Time Complexity
- **Counting frequencies:** O(N)
- **Heap operations:** O(N log M) where N is the number of barcodes and M is the number of unique barcodes.

Overall, the solution will run in O(N log M) time complexity.

## Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public class Solution {
    public int[] rearrangeBarcodes(int[] barcodes) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (int barcode : barcodes) {
            frequencyMap.put(barcode, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(barcode, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        PriorityQueue<int[]> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b[1] - a[1]);
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : frequencyMap.entrySet()) {
            maxHeap.offer(new int[]{entry.getKey(), entry.getValue()});
        }
        
        int index = 0;
        int[] result = new int[barcodes.length];
        while (!maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
            int[] first = maxHeap.poll();

            // If the result is not empty and the last element is the same as the current one, we need to swap
            if (index > 0 && result[index - 1] == first[0]) {
                int[] second = maxHeap.poll();
                result[index++] = second[0];
                if (--second[1] > 0) {
                    maxHeap.offer(second);
                }
                maxHeap.offer(first);
            } else {
                result[index++] = first[0];
                if (--first[1] > 0) {
                    maxHeap.offer(first);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

This code uses a max-heap to effectively rearrange the barcodes, ensuring that no two adjacent elements are the same. The frequency map helps in populating the max-heap, and careful handling of the most frequent elements ensures the constraints are met.
