## Problem Statement

1026. Maximum Difference Between Node and Ancestor

Given the `root` of a binary tree, find the maximum value `v` for which there exist different nodes `a` and `b` where `v = |a.val - b.val|` and `a` is an ancestor of `b`.

A node `a` is an ancestor of `b` if either: any child of `a` is equal to `b` or any child of `a` is an ancestor of `b`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for the nodes in the tree?**
   - The node values can be any integer.

2. **Can the tree have negative values?**
   - Yes, the tree can have negative values.

3. **What is the size of the tree (number of nodes)?**
   - There is no explicit constraint, but we can assume typical constraints for a binary tree (where maximum nodes would be around 10^4).

4. **Does it matter if the difference is negative?**
   - No, we consider the absolute difference, `|a.val - b.val|`.

5. **Should the result be only between nodes that have a direct parent-child relationship?**
   - No, itâ€™s for any ancestor and descendant pair, not necessarily direct.

## Strategy

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS) Approach:**
   - We will use DFS to traverse the tree.
   - At each node, we will keep track of the maximum and minimum values we have encountered so far along the path from the root to that node.
   - At each node, we compute the potential differences `|node.val - maxVal|` and `|node.val - minVal|`.
   - We update the global maximum difference if these values are higher.
   - We update `maxVal` and `minVal` for the current node and recursively call for its children.

2. **Handling Base Cases:**
   - If the node is `null`, simply return as there is no value to process.

## Code

```java
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

public class Solution {
    private int maxDiff;

    public int maxAncestorDiff(TreeNode root) {
        maxDiff = 0;
        dfs(root, root.val, root.val);
        return maxDiff;
    }

    private void dfs(TreeNode node, int maxVal, int minVal) {
        if (node == null) {
            return;
        }

        // Calculate the differences 
        int currentMaxDiff = Math.max(Math.abs(node.val - maxVal), Math.abs(node.val - minVal));

        // Update the global max difference
        maxDiff = Math.max(maxDiff, currentMaxDiff);

        // Update the max and min values for the path
        maxVal = Math.max(maxVal, node.val);
        minVal = Math.min(minVal, node.val);

        // Continue DFS traversal
        dfs(node.left, maxVal, minVal);
        dfs(node.right, maxVal, minVal);
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.
  - Each node is visited once.

- **Space Complexity:** O(H), where H is the height of the tree.
  - This is due to the recursive stack space.
  - In the worst case (unbalanced tree), it can be O(N).
  - In the best case (balanced tree), it is O(log N).

This solution ensures we efficiently calculate the maximum difference between any node and its ancestor.
