[Leetcode 981. Time Based Key](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l981)
## Problem Statement

You are required to design a time-based key-value store that can store multiple values for the same key at different time stamps and retrieve the key's value at a certain timestamp.

Implement the `TimeMap` class:

- `TimeMap()` Initializes the object of the data structure.
- `void set(String key, String value, int timestamp)` Stores the key `key` with the value `value` at the given time `timestamp`.
- `String get(String key, int timestamp)` Returns a value such that `set` was called previously with `timestamp_prev <= timestamp`. If there are multiple such values, it returns the value associated with the largest `timestamp_prev`. If there are no values, it returns an empty string `""`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the same key have multiple values at the same timestamp?
2. Are the timestamps guaranteed to be increasing for successive `set` calls for the same key?
3. How large can the number of keys and timestamps get?

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

class TimeMap {

    private Map<String, TreeMap<Integer, String>> map;

    public TimeMap() {
        map = new HashMap<>();
    }

    public void set(String key, String value, int timestamp) {
        if (!map.containsKey(key)) {
            map.put(key, new TreeMap<>());
        }
        map.get(key).put(timestamp, value);
    }

    public String get(String key, int timestamp) {
        if (!map.containsKey(key)) {
            return "";
        }
        TreeMap<Integer, String> treeMap = map.get(key);
        Integer closestTimestamp = treeMap.floorKey(timestamp);
        if (closestTimestamp == null) {
            return "";
        }
        return treeMap.get(closestTimestamp);
    }
}
```

## Strategy

### `set` Method
1. The `set` method initializes the map field if it does not exist for the given key.
2. It then stores the value in a `TreeMap` with the corresponding timestamp.

### `get` Method
1. The `get` method first checks if the key exists.
2. It retrieves the `TreeMap` associated with the key.
3. Uses the `floorKey` method of `TreeMap` to find the largest key less than or equal to the given timestamp.
4. If no such key exists, it returns an empty string. Otherwise, it retrieves the value associated with that timestamp.

## Time Complexity

- **set** method: `O(log N)` for each insertion where `N` is the number of timestamps for the particular key. The insertion into the `TreeMap` takes logarithmic time.

- **get** method: `O(log N)` for querying the floor key in the `TreeMap`.

- The overall space complexity is `O(K)`, where `K` is the number of unique keys multiplied by the number of timestamps each key has. This is because we are storing each value with its timestamp.

This solution offers efficient logarithmic time operations for both setting and getting values with respect to their associated timestamps.
