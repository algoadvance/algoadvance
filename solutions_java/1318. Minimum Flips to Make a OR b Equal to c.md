[Leetcode 1318. Minimum Flips to Make a OR b Equal to c](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1318)
### Problem Statement
You are given three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. You can flip a bit of `a` or `b` (i.e., change a 0 to a 1 or vice versa) to achieve the following goal: 

Make the result of `a OR b` equal to `c`. Find the minimum number of bit flips required to achieve this goal.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Can the integers `a`, `b`, and `c` be negative? 
     - No, they are positive integers.
   - What is the maximum value for `a`, `b`, and `c`?
     - It's typically up to \( 2^{31} - 1 \) since they are standard 32-bit integers.
     
2. **Output:**
   - Should the function return the minimum number of bit flips as an integer?
     - Yes.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to compare the bits of `a`, `b`, and `c` at each position from 0 to 31 (since the max value is \(2^{31} - 1\)). 

- For each bit position `i`:
  1. Extract the i-th bit of `a`, `b`, and `c`.
  2. Determine the desired outcome for the i-th bit:
     - If the i-th bit in `c` is 0, both `a` and `b` must have their i-th bits set to 0.
     - If the i-th bit in `c` is 1, at least one of `a` or `b` must have its i-th bit set to 1.
  3. Calculate the number of flips required for each bit position based on these rules.
  
- Sum the flips for each bit position to get the total number of flips needed.

### Code

```java
public class MinimumFlips {
    public int minFlips(int a, int b, int c) {
        int flips = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 32; i++) {
            // Extracting the i-th bits of a, b, and c
            int ai = (a >> i) & 1;
            int bi = (b >> i) & 1;
            int ci = (c >> i) & 1;

            if (ci == 0) {
                // If ci is 0, both ai and bi should be 0
                flips += (ai == 1 ? 1 : 0) + (bi == 1 ? 1 : 0);
            } else {
                // If ci is 1, at least one of ai or bi should be 1
                flips += (ai | bi) == 0 ? 1 : 0;
            }
        }
        
        return flips;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumFlips solution = new MinimumFlips();
        System.out.println(solution.minFlips(2, 6, 5)); // Expected output: 3
        System.out.println(solution.minFlips(4, 2, 7)); // Expected output: 1
        System.out.println(solution.minFlips(1, 2, 3)); // Expected output: 0
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(1)\) because it only iterates through the 32-bit positions, which is a constant number of iterations. The operations inside the loop are all constant-time bit manipulations.
