[Leetcode 1629. Slowest Key](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1629)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `keysPressed` of length `n` and an array `releaseTimes` where `releaseTimes[i]` denotes the time the `i-th` key was released. Both the string `keysPressed` and the array `releaseTimes` are of the same length.

The keypress durations are calculated as follows:

- For the first key, it is just `releaseTimes[0]`.
- For the subsequent keys, the duration is the difference between the current and the previous release time, i.e., `releaseTimes[i] - releaseTimes[i-1]`.

You need to return the key that had the longest duration. If there is a tie, return the lexicographically largest key.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - Could `keysPressed` contain lowercase English letters only?
      - **Yes**, `keysPressed` contains only lowercase English letters.
    - What is the range of the length `n` of `keysPressed` and `releaseTimes`?
      - `1 <= n <= 1000`

2. **Output Format**:
    - Should the output be the specific key character?
      - **Yes**, the output should be the key character with the longest duration.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Variables**:
    - A variable `max_duration` to keep track of the maximum duration.
    - A variable `result_key` to keep track of the key with the longest duration.

2. **Iterate Over the Input**:
    - Calculate the duration for each key.
    - Check if the current key duration is greater than `max_duration`. If yes, update `max_duration` and `result_key`.
    - If the current key duration is equal to `max_duration` but the key is lexicographically larger than `result_key`, update `result_key`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - Single key press should be straightforward as default values will address this scenario.

### Code

```java
public class SlowestKey {
    public char slowestKey(int[] releaseTimes, String keysPressed) {
        int n = releaseTimes.length;
        char resultKey = keysPressed.charAt(0);
        int maxDuration = releaseTimes[0];

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int duration = releaseTimes[i] - releaseTimes[i - 1];
            if (duration > maxDuration || (duration == maxDuration && keysPressed.charAt(i) > resultKey)) {
                maxDuration = duration;
                resultKey = keysPressed.charAt(i);
            }
        }

        return resultKey;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SlowestKey solution = new SlowestKey();
        int[] releaseTimes = {9, 29, 49, 50};
        String keysPressed = "cbcd";
        System.out.println(solution.slowestKey(releaseTimes, keysPressed)); // Output: 'c'
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of `keysPressed` or `releaseTimes`. We traverse through the list once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using only a constant extra space (variables like `maxDuration`, `resultKey`).

This solution will efficiently find the key with the longest duration while addressing ties using lexicographical order.
