[Leetcode 1192. Critical Connections in a Network](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1192)
### Problem Statement

You are given a network of `n` nodes, labeled from `0` to `n-1`. You are also given a list of `connections`, where `connections[i] = [a, b]` represents a connection between nodes `a` and `b`. Any two nodes can be connected by **at most one** connection and no node has a connection to itself.

A connection is **critical** if removing it will make some nodes unable to reach some other nodes.

Return all critical connections in the network in any order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the format of the output?**
   - The output should be a list of lists, where each inner list denotes a critical connection.
  
2. **Can the network be disconnected initially?**
   - No, the network is fully connected initially. If it were disconnected, some nodes would already be unreachable from others, violating the problem constraints.

3. **Are the connections bidirectional?**
   - Yes, each connection `[a, b]` implies `a` is connected to `b` and `b` is connected to `a`.

4. **Can the number of nodes `n` be very large?**
   - The constraints are not explicitly mentioned, but since it's a LeetCode Medium problem, usual constraints range from `1 <= n <= 10^4`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use Tarjan's Algorithm for finding bridges in a graph. A bridge (or a critical connection) is an edge which, when removed, makes the graph disconnected.

#### Steps:
1. Construct the graph using adjacency lists.
2. Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) to discover all nodes. Keep track of the discovery times of nodes.
3. Use a `low` array where `low[v]` represents the smallest discovery time reachable from node `v`.
4. If for any node `u` connected to `v`, we find that `low[u] > discovery time of v`, then `(v, u)` is a critical connection.

### Code

Here is a Java implementation of the solution:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class CriticalConnections {
    
    private List<List<Integer>> graph;
    private int[] discovery;
    private int[] low;
    private boolean[] visited;
    private List<List<Integer>> criticalConnections;
    private int time;

    public List<List<Integer>> criticalConnections(int n, List<List<Integer>> connections) {
        graph = new ArrayList<>();
        discovery = new int[n];
        low = new int[n];
        visited = new boolean[n];
        criticalConnections = new ArrayList<>();
        time = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }

        for (List<Integer> connection : connections) {
            int u = connection.get(0);
            int v = connection.get(1);
            graph.get(u).add(v);
            graph.get(v).add(u);
        }

        dfs(0, -1);

        return criticalConnections;
    }

    private void dfs(int u, int parent) {
        visited[u] = true;
        discovery[u] = low[u] = ++time;

        for (int v : graph.get(u)) {
            if (v == parent) continue;

            if (!visited[v]) {
                dfs(v, u);
                low[u] = Math.min(low[u], low[v]);

                if (low[v] > discovery[u]) {
                    criticalConnections.add(Arrays.asList(u, v));
                }
            } else {
                low[u] = Math.min(low[u], discovery[v]);
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CriticalConnections cc = new CriticalConnections();
        List<List<Integer>> connections = new ArrayList<>();
        connections.add(Arrays.asList(0, 1));
        connections.add(Arrays.asList(1, 2));
        connections.add(Arrays.asList(2, 0));
        connections.add(Arrays.asList(1, 3));
        
        System.out.println(cc.criticalConnections(4, connections));
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this solution is `O(V + E)`, where `V` is the number of vertices (nodes) and `E` is the number of edges (connections). This is because each node and edge is processed once.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is `O(V + E)` due to the adjacency list representation of the graph and other auxiliary arrays.

This solution ensures that all critical connections (bridges) are identified efficiently using DFS-based traversal and tracking mechanisms.
