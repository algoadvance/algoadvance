[Leetcode 1575. Count All Possible Routes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1575)
### Problem Statement

Given `n` locations, designated with integers from `0` to `n - 1`, and a `start` location, a `finish` location, and a value `fuel`, return the count of all possible routes such that you start at the `start` location and reach the `finish` location without running out of fuel. Each time you move from one city to another city, the required fuel equals the distance between these two cities. Please note that you are allowed to visit any city more than once. Two routes are considered different if they visit different cities in a different order.

You are given an array `locations` where `locations[i]` represents the position of the `i-th` city. The input is an integer array `locations`, an integer `start`, an integer `finish`, and an integer `fuel`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of values for `locations[i]`, `start`, `finish`, and `fuel`?
   - Typically, constraints are provided, but let's assume `locations` has a reasonable size (e.g., up to 100 locations).

2. Is the positions of the cities in the `locations` array in any specific sorted order? 
   - No, they are not necessarily sorted.

3. Are we allowed to visit a city multiple times and can we also revisit the start and finish city?
   - Yes, you can visit any city, including the start and finish city multiple times as long as you do not run out of fuel.

### Strategy

1. Use dynamic programming (DP) with memoization to optimize the solution. 
2. Define a `dp` table where `dp[i][f]` represents the number of possible routes to reach the finish from location `i` with `f` fuel left.
3. Initialize the DP state from the `finish` location, as reaching the `finish` with exact fuel will base its transitions.
4. Use recursion with memoization to explore all possible movements from current location `i` to any other location, updating the fuel accordingly.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    int MOD = 1_000_000_007;
    int[][] memo;  // Memoization array
    int[] locations;

    public int countRoutes(int[] locations, int start, int finish, int fuel) {
        int n = locations.length;
        this.locations = locations;
        memo = new int[n][fuel + 1];
        
        for (int[] row : memo)
            Arrays.fill(row, -1);

        return dfs(start, finish, fuel);
    }

    private int dfs(int current, int finish, int fuel) {
        if (fuel < 0)
            return 0;
        
        if (memo[current][fuel] != -1)
            return memo[current][fuel];
        
        int ans = (current == finish) ? 1 : 0;
        for (int next = 0; next < locations.length; next++) {
            if (next != current) {
                int fuelCost = Math.abs(locations[current] - locations[next]);
                ans = (ans + dfs(next, finish, fuel - fuelCost)) % MOD;
            }
        }
        
        memo[current][fuel] = ans;
        return ans;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] locations = new int[]{2,3,6,8,4};
        int start = 1;
        int finish = 3;
        int fuel = 5;
        System.out.println(sol.countRoutes(locations, start, finish, fuel));  // Output: 4
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n * fuel^2)
  - Each state in the DP table `dp[i][f]` is computed once. 
  - For every state, there is a nested iteration over `n` locations which results in `O(n * (n-1)) = O(n^2)`. 
  - Fuel states have `fuel` levels making it `O(fuel)`.

- **Space Complexity**: O(n * fuel)
  - Memoization array takes space proportional to number of locations and fuel levels.

This approach ensures an efficient solution by avoiding recomputation of already solved subproblems.
