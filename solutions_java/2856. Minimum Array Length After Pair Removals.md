[Leetcode 2856. Minimum Array Length After Pair Removals](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2856)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. In one operation, you are allowed to remove any pair of neighboring elements (i.e., `nums[i]` and `nums[i+1]` for any `i`), provided that the absolute difference between these elements is at most 1. Your goal is to perform the minimum number of operations so that no such neighboring pairs remain in the array.

Return the length of the array after performing the optimal number of operations.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be the return type of the function?**
   - The return type should be an integer representing the length of the array after the operations.

2. **What if the array is empty?**
   - If the array is empty, the return should be 0 since there are no elements to perform operations on.

3. **Can the absolute difference between any pair be more than 1?**
   - Yes, but such pairs cannot be removed in one operation. Only pairs with an absolute difference of at most 1 can be removed in one operation.

### Strategy

Given the problem constraints, the strategy is to focus on local minima and maxima and remove pairs optimally to reduce the array to its minimum possible form.

**Steps:**
1. **Traverse the array:** We'll check each pair of adjacent elements.
2. **Remove pairs:** For any pair where the absolute difference is at most 1, we'll remove the pair and continue checking the array from the start.
3. **Repeat until no more pairs can be removed:** Repeatedly remove pairs applicable by the rule until no more operations can be performed.
4. **Return the resulting array length** 

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int minArrayLength(int[] nums) {
        List<Integer> list = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            list.add(num);
        }

        boolean changed = true;
        while (changed) {
            changed = false;
            for (int i = 0; i < list.size() - 1; i++) {
                if (Math.abs(list.get(i) - list.get(i + 1)) <= 1) {
                    list.remove(i + 1);
                    list.remove(i);
                    changed = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }

        return list.size();
    }
}
```
### Time Complexity
- **Worst-case complexity:** O(n^2)
  - We traverse the list repeatedly which can take up to O(n) iterations removing pairs iteratively for each step.

This solution examines the whole list iteratively removing appropriate pairs and checking again until no more pairs can be removed, ensuring that the array is reduced optimally with minimal size.
