## Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 1267: Count Servers that Communicate

You are given a `m x n` grid, where each cell can have one of three values:
- `0` which is an empty cell.
- `1` which is a server.
- `2` which is a communication relay that does not serve itself but helps servers communicate.

From each server, you can only communicate with other servers that are directly in the same row or column. However, you can use the communication relay (`2`) to jump to any other relay and then continue the communication.

You need to find the number of servers that can communicate with at least one other server.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Communication Relay Behavior:** Does a communication relay (`2`) enable communication if it helps form a link between servers in the same row or column? 
   - Yes, servers connected indirectly through communication relays should also be considered as communicating.

2. **Grid Constraints:** What will be the dimensions of the grid (`m x n`)? Are there any constraints on the number of servers and relays?
   - Assume `1 <= m, n <= 250` and the grid contains at least 1 server.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, the approach will be:
1. Count the number of servers in each row and column.
2. Check each server:
   - If the count of servers in its row or column (including itself) is greater than 1, it can communicate with at least one other server.
3. Return the total count of such servers.

### Steps:
1. Create two arrays, `rowCount` and `colCount`, to store the number of servers in each row and column respectively.
2. Traverse the grid to populate these counts.
3. Traverse the grid again to count servers that meet the communication criteria.

## Code

```java
public class CountServersThatCommunicate {
    public int countServers(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        
        int[] rowCount = new int[m];
        int[] colCount = new int[n];
        
        // Step 1: Calculate the number of servers in each row and column.
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    rowCount[i]++;
                    colCount[j]++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Step 2: Count servers that can communicate with at least one other server.
        int serverCount = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    if (rowCount[i] > 1 || colCount[j] > 1) {
                        serverCount++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return serverCount;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CountServersThatCommunicate solver = new CountServersThatCommunicate();
        int[][] grid1 = {
            {1, 0},
            {0, 1}
        };
        int[][] grid2 = {
            {1, 0},
            {1, 1}
        };
        System.out.println(solver.countServers(grid1)); // Output: 0
        System.out.println(solver.countServers(grid2)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Step 1:** `O(m * n)` to traverse the entire grid and populate the counts.
- **Step 2:** `O(m * n)` to count the servers that can communicate.

Overall time complexity is `O(m * n)`.

This approach ensures an efficient calculation of servers that can communicate with at least one other server by leveraging simple counting arrays.
