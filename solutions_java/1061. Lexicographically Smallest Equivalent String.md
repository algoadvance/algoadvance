[Leetcode 1061. Lexicographically Smallest Equivalent String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1061)
### Problem Statement

Given two strings `s1` and `s2` of the same length, and a string `baseStr`, we want to find the lexicographically smallest equivalent string of `baseStr`.

The equivalent strings are defined by the following rule:

- If we can swap characters `a` and `b` in string `s1`, then we can also swap characters `a` and `b` in string `s2`.
- We can do it any number of times.

For example, given:
```plaintext
s1 = "parker", s2 = "morris", baseStr = "parser"
```

The equivalent mappings are:
```plaintext
'p' <-> 'm'
'a' <-> 'o'
'r' <-> 'r'
'k' <-> 'r'
'e' <-> 'i'
'r' <-> 's'
```

Among all the equivalents, we need to find the lexicographically smallest one for `baseStr`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length constraint for the strings?**
   - The strings `s1`, `s2`, and `baseStr` have lengths at most `10^3`.

2. **Are there any constraints on the characters used in the strings?**
   - The strings consist of lowercase English letters only.

3. **Can the characters form multiple disjoint sets?**
   - Yes, the characters in the strings can form multiple disjoint groups.

### Strategy

The problem can be approached using a Disjoint Set Union (DSU) or Union-Find data structure:

1. **Union Operations:**
   - For each character pairing in `s1` and `s2`, we'll perform a union operation.
   - We'll also maintain the lexicographically smallest representative for each set.

2. **Find Operation:**
   - We'll use the path compression technique to ensure efficient lookups.

3. **Replacement:**
   - For each character in `baseStr`, we'll replace it with the lexicographically smallest character from its set.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    static final int ALPHABET_SIZE = 26;
    
    public String smallestEquivalentString(String s1, String s2, String baseStr) {
        int[] parent = new int[ALPHABET_SIZE];
        
        // Initialize DSU structure
        for (int i = 0; i < ALPHABET_SIZE; i++) {
            parent[i] = i;
        }
        
        // Union-Find operations with union by ranking smallest lexicographical character
        for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); i++) {
            int p1 = find(parent, s1.charAt(i) - 'a');
            int p2 = find(parent, s2.charAt(i) - 'a');
            if (p1 != p2) {
                int min = Math.min(p1, p2);
                parent[p1] = min;
                parent[p2] = min;
            }
        }
        
        // Convert baseStr to its smallest lexicographically equivalent string
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        for (char c : baseStr.toCharArray()) {
            result.append((char)(find(parent, c - 'a') + 'a'));
        }
        
        return result.toString();
    }
    
    private int find(int[] parent, int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x) {
            parent[x] = find(parent, parent[x]);
        }
        return parent[x];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Union-Find Operations:** O(n), where n is the length of `s1` and `s2`. This is because each union-find operation is nearly constant time due to path compression.
- **Transformation of `baseStr`:** O(m), where m is the length of `baseStr`.
- **Overall:** O(n + m), which is efficient given the constraints.
