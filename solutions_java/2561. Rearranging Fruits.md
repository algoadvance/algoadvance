[Leetcode 2561. Rearranging Fruits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2561)
## Problem Statement

You have two fruit baskets, each containing several types of fruits. The quantities of fruit in the two baskets are represented by two integer arrays `basket1` and `basket2` of length `n`. You can swap the positions of any two fruits from different baskets. You want to minimize the total difference between the quantities of the same type of fruit in the two baskets. Formally, you need to minimize the sum of absolute differences between the quantities of the fruits in both baskets.

You can assume that you have unlimited quantities of a temporary holding basket that can be used during swaps.

Write a function `minFruitDifference(int[] basket1, int[] basket2)` that returns the minimum total difference after optimal rearrangement.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Are the arrays always of the same length? (Yes, both arrays `basket1` and `basket2` have the same length `n`.)
   - What is the range of the integers in the arrays? (Non-negative integers, no specified upper bound.)

2. **Output:**
   - Should return a single integer representing the minimum total difference.

3. **Example:**
   - Input: `basket1 = [4, 2, 3, 1]`, `basket2 = [2, 3, 4, 1]`
   - Output: `2`

## Strategy
1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We are given two arrays of equal length representing quantities of fruits in two different baskets.
   - The goal is to minimize the sum of differences for each fruit type by swapping.

2. **Approach:**
   - Using min-heap (or sorting both baskets and then computing the minimum difference).

3. **Steps:**
   - Sort both `basket1` and `basket2`.
   - Compute the absolute difference of each corresponding pair in the sorted arrays.
   - This sorted approach works because the minimal differences will pair up in the sorted arrays.

4. **Algorithm:**
   - Sort the two arrays.
   - Iterate through the sorted arrays and compute the sum of absolute differences.

## Code
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class RearrangingFruits {
    public static int minFruitDifference(int[] basket1, int[] basket2) {
        // Step 1: Sort both arrays
        Arrays.sort(basket1);
        Arrays.sort(basket2);
        
        // Step 2: Calculate the sum of absolute differences
        int totalDifference = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < basket1.length; i++) {
            totalDifference += Math.abs(basket1[i] - basket2[i]);
        }
        
        return totalDifference;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] basket1 = {4, 2, 3, 1};
        int[] basket2 = {2, 3, 4, 1};
        System.out.println(minFruitDifference(basket1, basket2)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting the arrays:** Sorting both arrays take `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the length of the arrays.
- **Summing the differences:** Calculating the sum of absolute differences takes `O(n)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`, dominated by the sorting step.
