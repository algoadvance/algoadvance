[Leetcode 483. Smallest Good Base](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l483)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer `n` represented as a string, return the smallest good base of `n`.

A good base `k >= 2` of `n` is a number such that `n = 1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(m-1)` for some integer `m >= 2`. 

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input format**: 
   - Can we assume the input `n` is always a valid large integer in string format? 
   - Are there any constraints on the size of `n`?

2. **Output format**: 
   - Should the output also be in string format? 

3. **Edge cases**:
   - Are we considering the smallest values for `n` (e.g., `n = "3"`)?
   - What should be the behavior for edge cases where a base might not be immediately clear?

### Code

Here is the Java code to solve the problem:

```java
public class SmallestGoodBase {
    public String smallestGoodBase(String n) {
        long num = Long.parseLong(n);
        
        // The maximum value for m: log2(num + 1)
        for (int m = (int)(Math.log(num + 1) / Math.log(2)); m >= 2; m--) {
            long k = (long)Math.pow(num, 1.0 / (m - 1));
            
            // We need to check if num is equal to sum of geometric series
            long sum = 1, base = 1;
            for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
                base *= k;
                sum += base;
            }
            
            if (sum == num) return String.valueOf(k);
        }
        
        // If no base found, the smallest base is num -1
        return String.valueOf(num - 1);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SmallestGoodBase solution = new SmallestGoodBase();
        System.out.println(solution.smallestGoodBase("13")); // Output: 3
        System.out.println(solution.smallestGoodBase("4681")); // Output: 8
        System.out.println(solution.smallestGoodBase("1000000000000000000")); // Output: 999999999999999999
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Binary Search Method**: 
   - Convert the input string to a long integer.
   - Iterate over possible values of `m` from the maximum possible (which is the integer part of `log2(n + 1)`) down to 2.
   - For each value of `m`, calculate the possible base `k` using binary search within the range of possible values.
        - `k` is approximately calculated as `pow(n, 1.0 / (m - 1))`.
        - Check if the sum of the geometric series `1 + k + k^2 + ... + k^(m-1)` matches `n`.
   - If a valid `k` is found, return it as the result.

### Time Complexity

- The outer loop runs `O(log(n))` times because the maximum value of `m` is `log2(n + 1)`.
- Inside the loop, the geometric series calculation runs `O(m)` times.
- Thus, the total time complexity is `O((log(n))^2)` due to the nested operations.

This solution is efficient and works within the constraints typically encountered in competitive programming.
