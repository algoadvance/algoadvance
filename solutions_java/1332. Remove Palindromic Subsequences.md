[Leetcode 1332. Remove Palindromic Subsequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1332)
## Problem Statement

1332. Remove Palindromic Subsequences

Given a string `s` consisting only of letters 'a' and 'b', you can delete any palindromic subsequence from `s`. Return the minimum number of steps to make the given string empty.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

A string is called palindromic if it reads the same backward as forward.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What characters are allowed in the string**:
   The string consists only of letters 'a' and 'b'.
2. **What is the length range of the string `s`**:
   The length of the string can range from 1 to 1000.
3. **What should be returned**:
   We should return the minimum number of steps required to make the given string empty.

## Strategy

### Key Points to Consider:
1. **Checking if the String is Palindromic**:
    - If the string is already a palindrome, we can remove it entirely in one step.
2. **Handling Non-Palindromic Strings**:
    - If the string is not a palindrome, we can delete all 'a's in one step and all 'b's in another step or vice versa. This will always take exactly 2 steps.

### Steps:
1. Check if the input string `s` is a palindrome.
2. If it is a palindrome, return 1.
3. If it is not a palindrome, return 2.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int removePalindromeSub(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.isEmpty()) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (isPalindrome(s)) {
            return 1;
        }
        return 2;
    }
    
    private boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = s.length() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            if (s.charAt(left) != s.charAt(right)) {
                return false;
            }
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        // Example usage:
        System.out.println(solution.removePalindromeSub("ababa")); // Output: 1
        System.out.println(solution.removePalindromeSub("abb"));   // Output: 2
        System.out.println(solution.removePalindromeSub("baabb")); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Checking if the String is Palindromic**:
  - O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is due to the linear scan required to compare characters from both ends.
- **Overall Complexity**:
  - The overall time complexity of the solution is O(n) because the dominant operation is checking if the string is a palindrome.

## Space Complexity
- O(1) since no additional space, other than variable storage, is required.
