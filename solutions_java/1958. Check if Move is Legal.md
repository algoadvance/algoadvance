[Leetcode 1958. Check if Move is Legal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1958)
### Problem Statement

You are given a `rows x cols` board representing the current state of a game board. The board contains pieces distinguished by either 'B' (Black) or 'W' (White) or empty cells denoted by '.'. Your goal is to determine if placing a piece ('B' or 'W') at a given position `(r, c)` would constitute a legal move.

The rules for a move to be considered legal are:
1. The placed piece must capture at least one of the opponent's pieces.
2. A piece is captured if it completes a straight line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) such that all pieces between the newly placed piece and another piece of the same color are of the opponent's color.

The function signature is:
```java
public boolean checkMove(char[][] board, int r, int c, char color);
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Edges/Diagonals Counts**: Are moves checked in straight lines only or do they also include diagonal lines?
   - Yes, moves are checked in straight lines (horizontal, vertical) and diagonals.

2. **Board Boundaries**: Are we guaranteed that the coordinates `(r, c)` provided will always reference an empty spot within board boundaries?
   - Yes, the provided coordinates will always reference an empty spot and will be within the board boundaries.

3. **Board Dimensions**: Are there any constraints on the dimensions of the board, such as minimum or maximum size?
   - Typically, for problems like these, we assume standard dimensions but it may range from small sizes (like 3x3) up to larger ones (like 8x8, similar to an Othello board).

### Strategy

To solve the problem:
1. **Direction Vectors**: Utilize eight possible direction vectors to determine straight lines (both horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions).
2. **Traversal**: For each direction, traverse from the given position to verify if an opponent's piece(s) are enclosed between two of the current player's pieces.
3. **Validation**: Return true if any single direction validates a legal move according to the game rules, otherwise return false.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean checkMove(char[][] board, int r, int c, char color) {
        // Direction vectors for 8 possible directions
        int[][] directions = {
            {-1, 0}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {0, 1}, // vertical and horizontal
            {-1, -1}, {-1, 1}, {1, -1}, {1, 1} // diagonals
        };
        
        char opponentColor = (color == 'B') ? 'W' : 'B';

        // Check each direction
        for (int[] dir : directions) {
            int x = r + dir[0];
            int y = c + dir[1];
            
            // Keep track if we found at least one opponent piece
            boolean foundOpponent = false;

            while (isValid(board, x, y) && board[x][y] == opponentColor) {
                foundOpponent = true;
                x += dir[0];
                y += dir[1];
            }
            
            // If we found opponent pieces and ended in our piece, it's a valid move
            if (foundOpponent && isValid(board, x, y) && board[x][y] == color) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
    
    // Helper method to check if the position is within board boundaries
    private boolean isValid(char[][] board, int x, int y) {
        return x >= 0 && x < board.length && y >= 0 && y < board[0].length;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        char[][] board = {
            {'.', 'B', 'W', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.'},
            {'B', 'W', 'B', 'B', '.', '.', '.', '.'},
            {'.', 'B', 'W', 'B', 'B', '.', '.', '.'},
            {'.', '.', 'B', 'W', 'B', '.', '.', '.'},
            {'.', '.', '.', 'B', 'W', 'B', '.', '.'},
            {'.', '.', '.', '.', 'B', 'W', 'B', '.'},
            {'.', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'B', 'W', '.'},
            {'.', '.', '.', '.', '.', '.', 'B', 'W'}
        };
        System.out.println(sol.checkMove(board, 4, 2, 'W')); // Example test, should be true or false based on the game logic
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time complexity**: `O(8 * n)` where `n` is the average number of cells traversed in any direction from the position `(r, c)`. This simplifies to `O(n)` in practice, assuming 8 (constant) directions.
- **Space complexity**: `O(1)`, since only a fixed amount of extra space is used for direction vectors and a few auxiliary variables.
