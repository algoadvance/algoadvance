[Leetcode 3200. Maximum Height of a Triangle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3200)
### Problem Statement

You are given an input integer `N`, which represents the number of units of material you can use to build a triangle. You need to determine the maximum height of a triangle that you can construct using these units, where every additional height level i (starting from 1) requires exactly `i` units to construct. 

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the range of the input integer N?
   - Is there a minimum value for N?
   
2. **Output**:
   - Are we supposed to return the height as an integer?

Assuming the constraints like most problems of this nature:
- \(0 \leq N \leq 10^9\)

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the Problem**:
   - We are dealing with a problem where adding levels to the triangle requires an increasing number of units.
   - Assuming we want to build a triangle with height `h`, the total number of units required will be the sum of the first `h` natural numbers.
     - This can be calculated using the formula for the sum of the first `h` natural numbers: \(\text{Sum} = \frac{h(h + 1)}{2}\)

2. **Finding the Maximum Height**:
   - We want to maximize the height `h` such that \(\frac{h(h + 1)}{2} \leq N\).
   - Rearranging gives a quadratic inequality in terms of `h`:
     \[ h^2 + h - 2N \leq 0 \]
   - We can solve this quadratic equation to find the maximum height.
  
3. **Implementation Plan**:
   - Use the quadratic formula \( h = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \), for this specific case.
     - Here \( a = 1 \), \( b = 1 \), and \( c = -2N \).
   - The feasible solution for `h` will be within the range of:
     \[ h = \frac{-1 + \sqrt{1 + 8N}}{2} \]

### Time Complexity

- **Computationally**: Solving a quadratic equation is \(O(1)\) (constant time).

### Code

```java
public class MaximumHeightOfTriangle {
    public static int maximumHeight(int N) {
        if (N == 0) return 0;

        // Calculate the discriminant of the quadratic equation
        double discriminant = 1 + 8 * (double) N;

        // Calculate the positive root using the quadratic formula
        double h = (-1 + Math.sqrt(discriminant)) / 2;

        // The height must be an integer, so we take the floor value of h
        return (int) Math.floor(h);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int N = 10;
        System.out.println("Maximum height of a triangle with " + N + " units is: " + maximumHeight(N));
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Code
1. **Special Case**: If \( N \) is 0, return 0 because no triangle can be formed.
2. **Discriminant**: Compute the discriminant of the quadratic equation, which in this case is \(1 + 8N\).
3. **Quadratic Formula**: Compute the height using the rearranged quadratic formula and take the floor value to ensure we work with whole units.
4. **Result**: Return the floor value of computed `h` to comply with the integer height requirement.

This approach ensures that we can efficiently find the maximum height within the constraints.
