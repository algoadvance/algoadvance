[Leetcode 2166. Design Bitset](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2166)
### Problem Statement

You are tasked with designing a Bitset data structure that supports the following operations:

1. **fix(index):** Fix the bit at the given index to `1`. If the bit is already `1`, no operation is performed.
2. **unfix(index):** Unfix the bit at the given index to `0`. If the bit is already `0`, no operation is performed.
3. **flip():** Flip all bits in the Bitset.
4. **all():** Check if all bits are set to `1`.
5. **one():** Check if at least one bit is set to `1`.
6. **count():** Return the count of bits that are set to `1`.
7. **toString():** Return the Bitset in string form (`0` and `1` representing each bit).

Create a class `Bitset` that implements the aforementioned methods.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Should the Bitset be fixed-length? If so, what is the typical length?
   - Yes, the Bitset has a fixed length which is provided during initialization.

2. What type of inputs should the functions handle? Should we handle invalid indices (negative or out of range)?
   - It is assumed that the inputs will always be valid.

### Strategy

1. **fix(index):** Set the bit at the specified index to `1`. 
2. **unfix(index):** Set the bit at the specified index to `0`.
3. **flip():** Swap all `0`s to `1`s and all `1`s to `0`s. One way to handle this efficiently is to use a flag to indicate the flipped status.
4. **all():** Check if the count of bits that are `1` equals the length of the Bitset.
5. **one():** Check if the count of bits that are `1` is greater than zero.
6. **count():** Maintain a count of the `1` bits that is updated with each fix and unfix operation.
7. **toString():** Generate the string representation based on the current bits and flipped status.

### Code

```java
class Bitset {
    private int maxSize;
    private int countOnes;
    private boolean isFlipped;
    private boolean[] bits;

    public Bitset(int size) {
        this.maxSize = size;
        this.countOnes = 0;
        this.isFlipped = false;
        this.bits = new boolean[size];
    }

    public void fix(int idx) {
        if((bits[idx] && !isFlipped) || (!bits[idx] && isFlipped)) {
            return; // already fixed
        }
        bits[idx] = !isFlipped;
        countOnes++;
    }

    public void unfix(int idx) {
        if((!bits[idx] && !isFlipped) || (bits[idx] && isFlipped)) {
            return; // already unfixed
        }
        bits[idx] = isFlipped;
        countOnes--;
    }

    public void flip() {
        isFlipped = !isFlipped;
        countOnes = maxSize - countOnes;
    }

    public boolean all() {
        return countOnes == maxSize;
    }

    public boolean one() {
        return countOnes > 0;
    }

    public int count() {
        return countOnes;
    }

    public String toString() {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(maxSize);
        for (int i = 0; i < maxSize; i++) {
            boolean bit = bits[i];
            if (isFlipped) {
                bit = !bit;
            }
            sb.append(bit ? '1' : '0');
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **fix(index)**: O(1) - Direct array access and condition check.
2. **unfix(index)**: O(1) - Direct array access and condition check.
3. **flip()**: O(1) - Just toggle a flag and update the count of `1`s.
4. **all()**: O(1) - Single comparison.
5. **one()**: O(1) - Single comparison.
6. **count()**: O(1) - Direct return.
7. **toString()**: O(n) - Iterates through the entire array.

This ensures that the operations are efficient while maintaining the correct values in the Bitset.
