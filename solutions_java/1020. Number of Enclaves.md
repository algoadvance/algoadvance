[Leetcode 1020. Number of Enclaves](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1020)
### Problem Statement

Given a 2D grid consisting of `0`s (which represent sea) and `1`s (which represent land), find the number of land cells in the grid for which we cannot walk off the boundary of the grid in any number of moves. In other words, you need to count the number of land cells that are completely surrounded by sea.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What are the constraints on the dimensions of the grid?
   - The grid dimensions are given by \(2 \leq m, n \leq 500\), where \(m\) is the number of rows and \(n\) is the number of columns.
2. Is there a probability of having a grid of all `0`s or all `1`s?
   - Yes, it's possible to have a grid of all `0`s or all `1`s.

### Strategy

1. **Flood Fill from the Boundaries**:
   - We'll start by marking all the land cells (`1`s) that are connected to the boundary of the grid. These cells cannot be part of an enclave.
   - To do this, perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) starting from all boundary cells that contain land.

2. **Count Unmarked Land Cells**:
   - Once we have marked all the boundary-connected land cells, the remaining `1`s in the grid are the enclaves.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int numEnclaves(int[][] grid) {
        int rows = grid.length;
        int cols = grid[0].length;
        
        // Perform DFS for boundary cells
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            if (grid[i][0] == 1) {
                dfs(grid, i, 0);
            }
            if (grid[i][cols-1] == 1) {
                dfs(grid, i, cols-1);
            }
        }
        
        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            if (grid[0][j] == 1) {
                dfs(grid, 0, j);
            }
            if (grid[rows-1][j] == 1) {
                dfs(grid, rows-1, j);
            }
        }
        
        // Count remaining land cells (enclaves)
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
    
    private void dfs(int[][] grid, int i, int j) {
        int rows = grid.length;
        int cols = grid[0].length;
        
        if (i < 0 || i >= rows || j < 0 || j >= cols || grid[i][j] == 0) {
            return;
        }
        
        grid[i][j] = 0; // Mark this cell as visited
        
        // Check all four directions: Up, Down, Left, Right
        dfs(grid, i - 1, j);
        dfs(grid, i + 1, j);
        dfs(grid, i, j - 1);
        dfs(grid, i, j + 1);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\), where \(m\) is the number of rows and \(n\) is the number of columns. This is because in the worst case, we might visit all cells in the grid.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\) in the worst case due to the recursion stack in DFS.

This method efficiently finds and counts the enclaves by leveraging depth-first search from the boundary cells.
