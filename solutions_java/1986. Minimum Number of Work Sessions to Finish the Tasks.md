[Leetcode 1986. Minimum Number of Work Sessions to Finish the Tasks](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1986)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `tasks` where `tasks[i]` represents the duration of the `i-th` task, and an integer `sessionTime` which represents the maximum duration of a single work session. You need to determine the minimum number of work sessions required to complete all the tasks. 

A work session is defined as a set of tasks that you perform consecutively without a break, and the total duration of these tasks should not exceed `sessionTime`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can a task be divided into smaller parts to fit into different sessions?**
   - No, each task has to be completed in one session and cannot be split.

2. **Is there any specific range for the values i.e., the number of tasks or session times?**
   - No specific range was given but we should assume reasonable bounds as per typical constraint limits in coding problems.

3. **Can we use helper functions or should everything be in one function?**
   - You are allowed to use helper functions if necessary to make the code more modular and readable.

### Strategy

We can approach this problem using the concept of the Depth First Search (DFS) with memoization to keep track of the minimum number of sessions required. 

We'll explore all possible ways to assign tasks to each session until all tasks are completed, while memoizing the results to avoid recomputation. 

### Code

Here is a Java implementation of the proposed solution:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int minSessions(int[] tasks, int sessionTime) {
        int n = tasks.length;
        int[] memo = new int[1 << n];
        Arrays.fill(memo, -1);
        return dfs(tasks, sessionTime, (1 << n) - 1, sessionTime, memo);
    }

    private int dfs(int[] tasks, int sessionTime, int mask, int remaining, int[] memo) {
        if (mask == 0) return 0;
        if (memo[mask] != -1) return memo[mask];
        
        // Default to a high number, we will minimize over the iterations.
        int result = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < tasks.length; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) { // task i is not yet done
                int newMask = mask & ~(1 << i);
                if (tasks[i] <= remaining) {
                    result = Math.min(result, dfs(tasks, sessionTime, newMask, remaining - tasks[i], memo));
                } else {
                    result = Math.min(result, 1 + dfs(tasks, sessionTime, newMask, sessionTime - tasks[i], memo));
                }
            }
        }
        
        memo[mask] = result;
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The overall time complexity is O(n * 2^n), where \( n \) is the number of tasks. This is because there are \( 2^n \) possible subsets of tasks, and for each subset, we perform a linear scan to find the optimal configuration.
- The space complexity is also O(2^n) due to the memoization array.

The DFS with memoization ensures that we avoid recomputation, making the algorithm efficient despite the high potential number of combinations.
