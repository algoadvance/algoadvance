[Leetcode 1593. Split a String Into the Max Number of Unique Substrings full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1593)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s`. Let us define a *split* of `s` as a list of non-empty substrings such that:

- The concatenation of all qubstrings forms the original string `s`.
- Each substring consists of unique characters.

Return the maximum number of substrings in such a split.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can a substring be a single character?
   - **A:** Yes, single character substrings are allowed.
   
2. **Q:** Are spaces and special characters considered as part of the substrings?
   - **A:** Yes, any character including spaces and special characters can be part of the substrings as long as substrings are unique.
   
3. **Q:** Can we assume that the input string only contains lowercase English letters?
   - **A:** For simplicity, we will assume that, but the solution can generalize to any characters.

4. **Q:** What is the maximum length of the input string?
   - **A:** The constraints are typically mentioned in the problem statement, but we may assume the length could go up to 10^4.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use backtracking. The idea is to recursively try to split the string into the maximum number of unique substrings. We'll maintain a set to track the substrings to ensure all substrings in our current split remain unique:

1. Use a backtracking approach where we will recursively try to use different substrings starting from the beginning of the remaining string.
2. Keep a set to store substrings that have already been used.
3. At each recursive call, try to include all possible substrings until the current character.
4. If the substring is unique (not in the set), add it to the set and move forward.
5. Track the maximum number of unique substrings found so far.
6. Backtrack by removing the substring from the set before trying the next substring.

### Code

Below is the implementation in Java:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class Solution {
    public int maxUniqueSplit(String s) {
        Set<String> set = new HashSet<>();
        return backtrack(s, 0, set);
    }
    
    private int backtrack(String s, int start, Set<String> set) {
        if (start == s.length()) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int maxUniqueCount = 0;
        for (int end = start + 1; end <= s.length(); end++) {
            String substring = s.substring(start, end);
            if (!set.contains(substring)) {
                set.add(substring);  // include substring
                // Recursively call for the remaining string and add 1 to count
                maxUniqueCount = Math.max(maxUniqueCount, 1 + backtrack(s, end, set));
                set.remove(substring);  // backtrack
            }
        }
        
        return maxUniqueCount;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        String s = "ababccc";
        System.out.println("Max number of unique substrings: " + sol.maxUniqueSplit(s)); // Output should be 5
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is a bit challenging to calculate precisely as it highly depends on the structure of the string. The worst-case scenario involves exploring a large number of splits, leading to an exponential time complexity. Hereâ€™s a rough estimate:
- Each recursion level can explore up to `n` splits where `n` is the length of `s`.
- Recursion can go up to `n` levels deep in the worst case.

Thus, the overall time complexity can be approximated as \(O(n * 2^n)\) in the worst case. However, for practical length strings (length <= 20), this approach is generally efficient enough.

### Conclusion

This solution uses backtracking to explore all possible ways to split the string into the maximum number of unique substrings. We keep track of the maximum number of unique substrings we can achieve with the given splits. This problem is a classic example where backtracking shines due to its ability to explore all potential solutions efficiently.
