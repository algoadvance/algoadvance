[Leetcode 2778. Sum of Squares of Special Elements ](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2778)
### Problem Statement

Leetcode problem 2778: Sum of Squares of Special Elements

Given an integer array `nums`, you need to find the sum of squares of all special elements. An element `nums[i]` is considered special if and only if it is divisible by the index `i+1`. Note that arrays are 0-indexed.

Return the sum of squares of all special elements as defined above.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Clarification on Indexing**: Since arrays are typically 0-indexed, should we consider divisibility by `i+1`?
   - Yes, an element `nums[i]` is special if it is divisible by `i + 1`.

2. **Input and Output Constraints**: Are there any constraints or edge cases we should be aware of?
   - The array could be empty. If it's empty, the sum should be 0.
   - Elements in the array can be positive or negative, and possibly zero.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize a sum**: Start with a sum of 0.
2. **Iterate through the array**: For each element `nums[i]`, check if it's divisible by `i+1` (since the array is 0-indexed).
3. **Calculate square and add to the sum**: If an element satisfies the condition, square it and add it to the sum.
4. **Return the total sum after iteration**.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the array since we only need to make a single pass through the array.
- Space complexity is **O(1)** since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

### Code

Here is the Java implementation:

```java
public class SumOfSquaresSpecialElements {
    public int sumOfSquares(int[] nums) {
        int sum = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] % (i + 1) == 0) {
                int square = nums[i] * nums[i];
                sum += square;
            }
        }

        return sum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SumOfSquaresSpecialElements sol = new SumOfSquaresSpecialElements();
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
        System.out.println(sol.sumOfSquares(nums));  // Expected output: 1+4+36 = 41
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **Line 3**: We initialize the `sum` to 0.
- **Line 5-11**: Iterate through the array, checking the condition for each element.
  - **Line 6**: For each element `nums[i]`, we check if it is divisible by `i+1`. If true,
  - **Line 7-8**: Calculate the square of `nums[i]` and add it to `sum`.
- **Line 13**: Finally, return the `sum` which holds the sum of squares of all special elements.
- **Lines 15-19**: Test the method with a sample input.

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and easy to understand.
