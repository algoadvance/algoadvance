[Leetcode 1123. Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1123)
### Problem Statement
1123. **Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves**

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.

A node is called a deepest leaf if it is a leaf at the deepest level of the binary tree.

The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes `p` and `q` as the lowest node in `T` that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).

### Clarifying Questions
Before we start coding, let's consider a few clarifying questions:
1. **Q:** What should be returned if the tree is empty?
   **A:** If the tree is empty, return `null`.
  
2. **Q:** What if there is only one node?
   **A:** If there is only one node, it is the LCA of itself.
  
3. **Q:** Are all values in the binary tree unique?
   **A:** Yes, assume all values in the binary tree are unique.

### Strategy
We'll solve this problem using Depth-First Search (DFS).

1. **Depth Calculation:** 
   - Calculate the depth of the deepest leaves.
   - This can be done using a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach where we keep track of the depth as we traverse.

2. **Find LCA of Deepest Leaves:**
   - Once we know the maximum depth, use another DFS to find the lowest common ancestor of all nodes at the deepest level.
   - When we find two nodes at the deepest level, return the common ancestor.

### Code
Here is the Java implementation of the above strategy:

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    // Pair to store both depth and TreeNode
    class Pair {
        int depth;
        TreeNode node;

        Pair(int depth, TreeNode node) {
            this.depth = depth;
            this.node = node;
        }
    }

    public TreeNode lcaDeepestLeaves(TreeNode root) {
        return dfs(root).node;
    }

    private Pair dfs(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return new Pair(0, null);
        }
        // Post-order traversal to compute depth of each subtree
        Pair left = dfs(root.left);
        Pair right = dfs(root.right);
        
        if (left.depth > right.depth) {
            return new Pair(left.depth + 1, left.node);
        } else if (right.depth > left.depth) {
            return new Pair(right.depth + 1, right.node);
        } else {
            return new Pair(left.depth + 1, root);
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The `dfs` function traverses each node exactly once.
- The depth calculation and LCA finding are both done in a single sweep.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(N)**, where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.

The space complexity is **O(H)**, where H is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack. In the worst case (for a skewed tree), H can be O(N).
