[Leetcode 1793. Maximum Score of a Good Subarray](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1793)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums` (0-indexed) and an integer `k`.

The score of a subarray (i, j) is defined as `min(nums[i], nums[i+1], ..., nums[j]) * (j - i + 1)`.

A good subarray is any subarray (i, j) which contains the element `nums[k]`.

Return the maximum possible score of a good subarray.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of the length of the array `nums`?
   - The array will contain at least 1 element and at most 10^5 elements.
2. What is the range of the integer elements in `nums`?
   - The elements in the array can range from 0 to 10^4.
3. Can `k` be out of the bounds of the array?
   - No, `k` will always be a valid index within the bounds of the array `nums`.

## Strategy

1. Use a two-pointer technique starting from the index `k`.
2. Expand the subarray to the left and right, maintaining the minimum value of the current subarray.
3. Calculate the score for the current subarray.
4. Track and update the maximum score as you expand.
5. Return the maximum score found.

## Code

```java
public class MaximumScoreGoodSubarray {
    public int maximumScore(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int left = k, right = k;
        int minValue = nums[k];
        int maxScore = minValue;

        while (left > 0 || right < n - 1) {
            if (left == 0) {
                right++;
            } else if (right == n - 1) {
                left--;
            } else if (nums[left - 1] < nums[right + 1]) {
                right++;
            } else {
                left--;
            }

            minValue = Math.min(minValue, Math.min(nums[left], nums[right]));
            maxScore = Math.max(maxScore, minValue * (right - left + 1));
        }

        return maxScore;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximumScoreGoodSubarray sol = new MaximumScoreGoodSubarray();
        int[] nums = {1,4,3,7,4,5};
        int k = 3;
        System.out.println(sol.maximumScore(nums, k)); // Output should be 15
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array `nums`. This is because in the worst case, we may need to move both pointers from one end of the array to the other.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This approach is efficient and maintains the required time complexity for large input sizes.
