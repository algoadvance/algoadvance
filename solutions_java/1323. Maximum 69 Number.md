[Leetcode 1323. Maximum 69 Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1323)
### Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer `num` consisting only of digits 6 and 9.

Return the maximum number you can get by changing at most one digit (6 becomes 9, and 9 becomes 6).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What constraints are there on the size of the number?**
   - The number will be a positive integer composed only of digits 6 and 9. The constraints on the number's length are not specified in the problem, but usually leetcode problems adhere to typical integer ranges in Java.

2. **Can the number have more than one occurrence of digit 6 or 9?**
   - Yes, the number can have multiple occurrences of 6 and 9.

3. **Do we only make one change or can we choose not to make any changes if it's already maximized?**
   - We are allowed to make one change at most. If it's already maximized, we may choose not to make any changes.

### Strategy

1. **Convert the number to a string**: This makes it easier to iterate through the digits.
2. **Identify the first occurrence of digit '6'**: Changing this to '9' will give us the maximum number.
3. **Change the first '6' to '9'**: Convert the modified string back to an integer.
4. **Return the modified number**.

### Code

```java
public class Maximum69Number {
    public static int maximum69Number(int num) {
        // Convert the number to a string to manipulate the digits more easily
        String numStr = String.valueOf(num);
        
        // Convert the string to a char array for in-place modification
        char[] numArray = numStr.toCharArray();
        
        // Iterate over the array and change the first '6' to '9'
        for (int i = 0; i < numArray.length; i++) {
            if (numArray[i] == '6') {
                numArray[i] = '9';
                break;  // Only change the first '6'
            }
        }
        
        // Convert the modified char array back to a string and then to an integer
        return Integer.parseInt(new String(numArray));
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int num = 9669;
        System.out.println(maximum69Number(num));  // Output: 9969
        
        num = 9999;
        System.out.println(maximum69Number(num));  // Output: 9999
        
        num = 669;
        System.out.println(maximum69Number(num));  // Output: 969
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **O(n)**: Where `n` is the number of digits in the number. This is because we are potentially iterating through all the digits of the number until we find the first '6'.
  
### Space Complexity

- **O(n)**: For the char array and the conversion of the number to a string. 

This solution ensures that we only make the necessary one change to maximize the number efficiently.
