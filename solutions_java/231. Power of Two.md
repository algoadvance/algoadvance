[Leetcode 231. Power of Two](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l231)
### Problem Statement

Determine if a given integer \( n \) is a power of two. A number is considered a power of two if it can be expressed as \( 2^k \) where \( k \) is a non-negative integer.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on Input:**
   - Is \( n \) always an integer? 
     - Yes, \( n \) is always an integer.
   - Can \( n \) be negative or zero?
     - Yes, \( n \) can be any integer which includes negative numbers and zero.
   
2. **Expected Output:**
   - Should the function return a boolean value?
     - Yes, the function should return `true` if \( n \) is a power of two, otherwise return `false`.

3. **Efficiency Constraints:**
   - Is there a preferred time complexity?
     - Aim for an efficient solution, ideally O(1).

### Strategy

To determine if \( n \) is a power of two, we can utilize the properties of binary representation of powers of two:
   
- A power of two in binary form has exactly one '1' bit and the rest are '0's. For example, 1 (2^0), 2 (2^1), 4 (2^2), 8 (2^3) are 1, 10, 100, and 1000 in binary respectively.

   One efficient way to leverage this property is using a bitwise AND operation. For a binary number that represents a power of two:
   - \( n \) & (n - 1) should be 0. This is because \( n \) has exactly one '1' bit in its binary representation and \( n-1 \) will have all bits flipped after that '1' bit is the first '0'.
   
- Additionally, \( n \) should be greater than 0.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfTwo(int n) {
        // If n is less than or equal to 0, it can't be a power of two
        if (n <= 0) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // Check if n is a power of two using the bitwise trick
        return (n & (n - 1)) == 0;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initial Check:**
   - We first check if \( n \) is less than or equal to 0. If it is, return `false` because a power of two must be a positive number.

2. **Bitwise Check:**
   - Perform \( n \& (n - 1) \) and check if the result is 0. 
   - This works because if \( n \) is a power of two, its binary representation has a single '1' bit followed by zeros. \( n-1 \) flips all bits after the '1' bit, so \( n \& (n-1) \) should be zero.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is O(1) because both the check for \( n \) being less than or equal to 0 and the bitwise operation \( n \& (n - 1) \) are constant-time operations.
