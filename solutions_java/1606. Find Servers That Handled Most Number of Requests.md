[Leetcode 1606. Find Servers That Handled Most Number of Requests](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1606)
### Problem Statement
You have `k` servers numbered from `0` to `k-1` that are being used to handle `n` requests arriving at various times. Each request will be handled by the first available server.

You are given a strictly increasing array `arrival` of positive integers, where `arrival[i]` is the arrival time of the `i-th` request, and another array `load`, where `load[i]` represents the time it takes for the `i-th` server to handle the `i-th` request upon its arrival.

Your task is to find the servers that handled the most number of requests. You are to return a list of the server indices in ascending order which handled the most number of requests.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can two requests have the same arrival time?**
   - No, as per the problem statement, the `arrival` array is strictly increasing.

2. **Can a server handle more than one request at the same time?**
   - No, a server will start handling another request only after it has completely handled the current request.

3. **What should be returned if multiple servers handled the maximum number of requests?**
   - We should return a list of server indices in ascending order.

4. **Should we assume the number of servers (k) will be less than the number of requests (n)?**
   - Typically, `k` could be less than, equal to, or greater than `n`.

### Strategy
1. **Data Structures**: 
    - Use a min-heap to manage the available servers indexed by their finishing time.
    - Use an array to count the number of requests handled by each server.
    
2. **Processing Requests**: 
    - For each request, determine which servers are currently available.
    - Use modulo arithmetic to rotate through servers to handle requests in a round-robin fashion.
    - If no servers are available immediately, skip to the next request.

### Code
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> busiestServers(int k, int[] arrival, int[] load) {
        // Heap to manage available servers
        PriorityQueue<int[]> availableServers = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[0]));
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            availableServers.offer(new int[]{0, i});
        }
        
        // Array to count requests handled by each server
        int[] requestCount = new int[k];
        TreeSet<Integer> freeServersSet = new TreeSet<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            freeServersSet.add(i);
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < arrival.length; i++) {
            // Free up servers that have completed their jobs
            while (!availableServers.isEmpty() && availableServers.peek()[0] <= arrival[i]) {
                freeServersSet.add(availableServers.poll()[1]);
            }

            if (freeServersSet.isEmpty()) {
                continue;
            }
            
            Integer serverIndex = freeServersSet.ceiling(i % k);
            if (serverIndex == null) {
                serverIndex = freeServersSet.ceiling(0);
            }
            freeServersSet.remove(serverIndex);
            requestCount[serverIndex]++;
            
            // Add server to busy servers with end time when it's done handling current job
            availableServers.offer(new int[]{arrival[i] + load[i], serverIndex});
        }
        
        int maxRequests = Arrays.stream(requestCount)
                                .max()
                                .orElse(0);
        
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < requestCount.length; i++) {
            if (requestCount[i] == maxRequests) {
                result.add(i);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Processing each request involves potentially updating the heap of available servers (`O(log k)` for insertion and deletion).
- Updating the `TreeSet` for free servers also takes `O(log k)` for insertion and deletion.
- For `n` requests and `k` servers, the overall time complexity will be `O(n log k)`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the first available server, update server states, and count the number of requests handled by each server within the specified constraints.
