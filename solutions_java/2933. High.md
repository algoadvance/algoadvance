[Leetcode 2933. High](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2933)
### Problem Statement:

You are given two string arrays `names` and `access`. `names[i]` represents the name of the `i-th` employee and `access[i]` represents the access level of the `i-th` employee. The access level is guaranteed to be an integer represented as a string.

An employee is considered a "high-access employee" if their access level is strictly greater than 3.

Return a list of names of all high-access employees. The order of names in the returned list should be the same as their order in the input array.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Are the lengths of `names` and `access` always the same?**
   - Yes, each employee in `names` has a corresponding access level in `access`.

2. **What should be returned if there are no high-access employees?**
   - Return an empty list.

3. **Can the `access` string have non-integer values?**
   - No, it is guaranteed that `access` contains valid integer values as strings.

4. **Is the order of the names in the output important?**
   - Yes, the order should be the same as in the input list.

### Strategy:

1. **Initialize an empty list** to store the names of high-access employees.
2. **Iterate through both arrays `names` and `access`** simultaneously.
3. **Convert the access level** from a string to an integer for comparison.
4. Check if the access level is greater than 3. If it is, **append the corresponding name** to the list of high-access employees.
5. **Return the list** of high-access employee names.

### Code:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class HighAccessEmployees {
    public List<String> highAccessEmployees(String[] names, String[] access) {
        List<String> highAccessEmployees = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < names.length; i++) {
            int accessLevel = Integer.parseInt(access[i]);
            if (accessLevel > 3) {
                highAccessEmployees.add(names[i]);
            }
        }

        return highAccessEmployees;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HighAccessEmployees solver = new HighAccessEmployees();
        String[] names = {"Alice", "Bob", "Charlie", "David"};
        String[] access = {"2", "6", "3", "5"};
        
        List<String> result = solver.highAccessEmployees(names, access);
        System.out.println(result);  // Output: [Bob, David]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of the solution is **O(n)** where *n* is the number of employees. This is because we simply iterate through the arrays once, performing constant-time operations for each employee.

### Space Complexity:

The space complexity is **O(k)** where *k* is the number of high-access employees. This space is used for the list to store the names of high-access employees. The additional space used is proportional to the output size.
