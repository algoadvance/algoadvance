[Leetcode 1888. Minimum Number of Flips to Make the Binary String Alternating full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1888)
### Problem Statement

Given a binary string `s`, you are allowed to perform one operation on the string. In one operation, you can pick any index `i` and flip the bits of the substring `s[i:]` (i.e., from `i` to the end of the string).

Return the **minimum number of operations** needed to make the binary string alternating. A binary string is alternating if no two adjacent bits are the same.

Example:
- `s = "111000"`
  - Output: `1`
  - Explanation: Flip the substring starting at index `2` (0-based) to get `"110101"`, which is alternating.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length of the string?**
   - The length `n` can be up to \(10^5\).

2. **What are the characters in the string?**
   - The string contains only '0' and '1'.

3. **Is it always guaranteed that the input string is non-empty?**
   - Yes, the string will have at least one character.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to generate two patterns of alternating binary strings:
- Pattern 1: Starting with '0', e.g., "010101..."
- Pattern 2: Starting with '1', e.g., "101010..."

For each given string `s`, we will try to align it with both patterns by calculating the number of mismatches:
- Calculate the mismatches for aligning `s` with both patterns.
- Determine possible starting positions to flip the string.

Steps:
1. Compute the number of mismatches for aligning `s` with the first pattern.
2. Shift the pattern and use a sliding window approach to see the effect of flipping at different indices of the string.
3. Return the minimum mismatch count observed during the sliding.

### Code
The following code demonstrates the above strategy:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minFlips(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        s += s;
        
        char[] pattern1 = new char[s.length()];
        char[] pattern2 = new char[s.length()];

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            pattern1[i] = i % 2 == 0 ? '0' : '1';
            pattern2[i] = i % 2 == 0 ? '1' : '0';
        }

        int minFlips = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int mismatch1 = 0;
        int mismatch2 = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) != pattern1[i]) mismatch1++;
            if (s.charAt(i) != pattern2[i]) mismatch2++;

            if (i >= n) {
                if (s.charAt(i - n) != pattern1[i - n]) mismatch1--;
                if (s.charAt(i - n) != pattern2[i - n]) mismatch2--;
            }

            if (i >= n - 1) {
                minFlips = Math.min(minFlips, Math.min(mismatch1, mismatch2));
            }
        }

        return minFlips;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.minFlips("111000")); // Output: 1
        System.out.println(solution.minFlips("01001001101")); // Example: Output may vary
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the original string. This is because:
- We construct the extended string \(s + s\) in \(O(n)\) time.
- We iterate over the extended string \(2n\) to count mismatches and update them using a sliding window, which takes \(O(n)\) additional time.

Thus, the total time complexity is \(O(n)\), which is efficient for large inputs up to \(10^5\).
