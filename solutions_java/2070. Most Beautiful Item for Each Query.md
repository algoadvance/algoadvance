[Leetcode 2070. Most Beautiful Item for Each Query](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2070)
### Problem Statement

2070. Most Beautiful Item for Each Query-out

You are given two 2D integer arrays, `items` and `queries`.

- `items[i] = [price_i, beauty_i]` indicates that for the i-th item, its price is `price_i` and its beauty is `beauty_i`.
- `queries[j] = maxPrice_j` indicates the permissible maximum price for the j-th query: For this query, you need to determine the maximum possible beauty of an item whose price is less than or equal to `maxPrice_j`.

You need to return an array of integers where the `j-th` integer is the answer to the `j-th` query.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Does the order of the output need to match the order of the input queries?**
   - Yes, the output should maintain the order of the input queries.
   
2. **What if no items are affordable within the given query price?**
   - If no items are affordable for a given query price, return 0 for that query.
   
3. **Is there a limit on the size of `items` and `queries` arrays?**
   - Typical LeetCode constraints will apply such as both arrays could have up to 10^4 elements.

4. **Are price and beauty values always positive?**
   - Yes, typically `price` and `beauty` values are always non-negative integers.

### Strategy

1. **Sorting for Efficiency:**
   - Sort the `items` based on the price. This allows us to more easily search for the highest beauty values within a budget constraint.
   
2. **Maximize Beauty Values:**
   - As we process sorted items, keep track of the maximum beauty value found up to each price point.
   
3. **Binary Search for Queries:**
   - For each query, use binary search on the sorted items to find the highest price less than or equal to the query price, then return the precomputed maximum beauty for that price.
   
4. **Store Results in Order:**
   - Maintain the order of the original queries by using indices.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.TreeMap;

public class Solution {
    public int[] maximumBeauty(int[][] items, int[] queries) {
        // Step 1: Sort items by their price
        Arrays.sort(items, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
        
        // Step 2: Build the map to store the maximum beauty for each price
        TreeMap<Integer, Integer> priceToBeauty = new TreeMap<>();
        int currentMaxBeauty = 0;
        
        for (int[] item : items) {
            currentMaxBeauty = Math.max(currentMaxBeauty, item[1]);
            priceToBeauty.put(item[0], currentMaxBeauty);
        }
        
        // Step 3: Process each query using the TreeMap
        int[] result = new int[queries.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < queries.length; i++) {
            Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry = priceToBeauty.floorEntry(queries[i]);
            result[i] = (entry != null) ? entry.getValue() : 0;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[][] items = // use example above
        int[] queries = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        int[] result = sol.maximumBeauty(items, queries);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(result)); // Output: [2, 4, 4, 4]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting Items:** O(n log n), where `n` is the number of items.
- **Building Max-Beauty Map:** O(n), to iterate through the sorted items.
- **Processing Queries:** O(m log n), where `m` is the number of queries, due to the `floorEntry` operation in the TreeMap which is O(log n).
  
**Overall Time Complexity:** O((n + m) log n), combining all steps.

This strategy ensures that we efficiently handle large sets of items and queries while providing the correct beauty values in the fastest possible manner.
