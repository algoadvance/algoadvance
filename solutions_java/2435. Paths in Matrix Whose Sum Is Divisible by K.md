[Leetcode 2435. Paths in Matrix Whose Sum Is Divisible by K full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2435)
### Problem Statement

Given a `m x n` matrix `grid` and an integer `k`, you need to find the number of paths from the top-left corner of the matrix to the bottom-right corner such that the sum of the elements along the path is divisible by `k`. You can only move either down or right from a cell.

The number of paths should be returned modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Matrix dimensions**: What are the constraints on `m` and `n`?
   - **Constraints**: `1 <= m, n <= 50`
   
2. **Element values**: What are the constraints on the values within the matrix?
   - **Constraints**: `-1000 <= grid[i][j] <= 1000`
   
3. **Sum range and divisibility**: Are there any special considerations we need to take for negative sums?
   - **Answer**: Yes, negative sums should be handled appropriately by taking modulo `k` after converting sums to non-negative equivalents.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP)**: We can use a 3D DP table `dp[i][j][r]` where `i` and `j` are the coordinates in the matrix and `r` is the remainder when the sum is divided by `k`.

2. **Transition**:
    - From `dp[i-1][j][r']`, update `dp[i][j][(r' + grid[i][j]) % k]`
    - From `dp[i][j-1][r']`, update `dp[i][j][(r' + grid[i][j]) % k]`

3. **Initialization**: Start from `dp[0][0][grid[0][0] % k] = 1`.

4. **Modular Arithmetic**: As the number of paths could be large, keep results modulo `10^9 + 7`.

5. **Result Extraction**: Look at `dp[m-1][n-1][0]` for paths where sum modulo `k` is `0`.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    private static final int MOD = 1000000007;

    public int numberOfPaths(int[][] grid, int k) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;

        int[][][] dp = new int[m][n][k];

        dp[0][0][grid[0][0] % k] = 1;

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                for (int r = 0; r < k; r++) {
                    if (i > 0) {
                        int prevR = (r - grid[i][j] % k + k) % k;
                        dp[i][j][r] = (dp[i][j][r] + dp[i-1][j][prevR]) % MOD;
                    }
                    if (j > 0) {
                        int prevR = (r - grid[i][j] % k + k) % k;
                        dp[i][j][r] = (dp[i][j][r] + dp[i][j-1][prevR]) % MOD;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[m-1][n-1][0];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(m * n * k)` because we are iterating over each cell in the matrix and for each cell, we are iterating through `k` possible remainders.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(m * n * k)` for the 3D DP array.

This solution efficiently computes the number of valid paths by utilizing dynamic programming and handles the constraints and modular arithmetic as required.
