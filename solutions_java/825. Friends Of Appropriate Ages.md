[Leetcode 825. Friends Of Appropriate Ages](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l825)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array `ages` where `ages[i]` is the age of the i-th person. A person `A` can send a friend request to person `B` if the following conditions are met:
1. `age[B] <= 0.5 * age[A] + 7`
2. `age[B] > age[A]`
3. `age[B] > 100 && age[A] < 100`

Given these conditions, return the total number of friend requests made.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are `age[B] = age[A]` requests allowed?
2. Is there a maximum length for the `ages` array or any constraints on it?
3. Does age start from any particular minimum age?
4. If age[A] is 100 (or larger), and age[B] is 100 (or larger), are they allowed to send friend requests to each other?

Assuming the constraints are reasonably large (say up to a few thousand elements in `ages` and age ranges from 1 to 120).

### Strategy
We will:

1. Sort the array to handle age comparisons more efficiently.
2. Iterate through the array, keeping track of the number of valid friends a particular person can send requests to using two pointers or binary search methods.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class FriendsOfAppropriateAges {
    public int numFriendRequests(int[] ages) {
        // Sort the ages array to facilitate efficient range queries
        Arrays.sort(ages);
        int totalRequests = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < ages.length; i++) {
            int ageA = ages[i];
            if (ageA < 15) continue; // No person with age < 15 can send any valid request
            
            // Find ageB's lower and upper bounds
            int minAgeB = ageA / 2 + 7;
            int maxAgeB = ageA;
            
            int countInRange = countInRange(ages, minAgeB, maxAgeB);
            totalRequests += (countInRange - 1); // Exclude self from the count
        }
        
        return totalRequests;
    }
    
    private int countInRange(int[] ages, int minAge, int maxAge) {
        return upperBound(ages, maxAge) - lowerBound(ages, minAge);
    }
    
    private int lowerBound(int[] ages, int minAge) {
        int left = 0, right = ages.length;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (ages[mid] > minAge) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
    
    private int upperBound(int[] ages, int maxAge) {
        int left = 0, right = ages.length;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (ages[mid] <= maxAge) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FriendsOfAppropriateAges solution = new FriendsOfAppropriateAges();
        int[] ages = {16, 17, 18};
        System.out.println(solution.numFriendRequests(ages));  // Output 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Sorting the array takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the `ages` array.
- Each query for `countInRange`, which involves two binary searches, takes \(O(\log n)\). Since we do this for each age, this step takes \(O(n \log n)\) in total.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).
