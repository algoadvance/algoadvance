[Leetcode 2176. Count Equal and Divisible Pairs in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2176)
### Problem Statement
Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of size `n` and an integer `k`, return the number of pairs `(i, j)` where `0 <= i < j < n`, such that:
1. `nums[i] == nums[j]` and
2. `(i * j)` is divisible by `k`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the input values?**
   - The constraints are `1 <= nums.length <= 100` and `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`.
2. **Can there be negative values or zeros in the array?**
   - No, since the constraints specify `1 <= nums[i] <= 100`, all elements are positive integers.
3. **Is it possible for `k` to be zero?**
   - No, according to general mathematical constraints, a divisor cannot be zero. So `k >= 1`.

### Strategy

1. **Brute Force Approach**
   - Iterate over each pair `(i, j)` with `i < j` and check both conditions.
   - If both conditions are met, count it as a valid pair.

2. **Optimized Approach**
   - We can still use a nested loop due to the constraint `nums.length <= 100`, which makes it feasible.
   - For each pair `(i, j)`, check if `nums[i] == nums[j]` and `(i * j) % k == 0`.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int countPairs(int[] nums, int k) {
        int count = 0;
        int n = nums.length;
        
        // Iterate over each pair (i, j)
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                // Check if nums[i] == nums[j] and (i * j) % k == 0
                if (nums[i] == nums[j] && (i * j) % k == 0) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Iterations**: The outer loop runs `n` times and the inner loop runs approximately `n/2` times, leading to `O(n^2)`.
- **Comparison and Modulus Operations**: Each pair comparison is `O(1)`, making the total complexity `O(n^2)`.

This is efficient given the constraints, as `n` is at most 100, making it computationally feasible to use `O(n^2)` approach.
