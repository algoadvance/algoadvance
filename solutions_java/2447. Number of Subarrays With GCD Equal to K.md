[Leetcode 2447. Number of Subarrays With GCD Equal to K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2447)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of subarrays where the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the subarray's elements equals `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size range of the array `nums`?**
   The size of the array `nums` can range from 1 to 10^4.

2. **What are the possible values in `nums`?**
   The values in `nums` can range from 1 to 2 * 10^4.

3. **What is the range of `k`?**
   The value of `k` will be a positive integer and will be within the range of the elements in `nums`.

4. **Are the elements of the array all positive integers?**
   Yes, all elements in `nums` are positive integers.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to iterate through every possible subarray of `nums` and calculate the GCD of its elements. If the GCD of any subarray is equal to `k`, we count that subarray.

1. **Iterate through the array**: Use two nested loops to generate all possible subarrays of `nums`.
   
2. **Calculate the GCD of each subarray**: Utilize the helper method `gcd` to efficiently calculate the GCD of elements in the subarray.

3. **Count the subarrays**: If the GCD of a subarray matches `k`, increment our result counter.

### Code

Here's how you can implement the solution in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int subarrayGCD(int[] nums, int k) {
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int currentGCD = nums[i];
            for (int j = i; j < nums.length; j++) {
                currentGCD = gcd(currentGCD, nums[j]);
                if (currentGCD == k) {
                    count++;
                } else if (currentGCD < k) {
                    break;  // No further subarrays from this point can have a GCD of k
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
    
    private int gcd(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            int temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Outer loop**: Runs `n` times, where `n` is the length of `nums`.
- **Inner loop**: In the worst case, it also runs `n` times.
- **GCD Calculation**: Each calculation takes O(log(min(a, b))), where `a` and `b` are elements from `nums`.

Since both the outer and inner loops run up to `n` times in the worst case, the overall time complexity is `O(n^2 * log(min(a, b)))`.

- **Worst-case scenario**: O(n^2 * log(max_element)), where `max_element` is the largest element in `nums` (up to 2 * 10^4).

This should be efficient enough given the constraints.
