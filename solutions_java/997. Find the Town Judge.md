[Leetcode 997. Find the Town Judge](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l997)
### Problem Statement

In a town, there are `n` people labeled from `1` to `n`. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

1. The town judge trusts nobody.
2. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
3. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.

You are given an array `trust` where `trust[i] = [a, b]` representing that the person labeled `a` trusts the person labeled `b`.

Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return `-1` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Question:** What should be returned if there are no people in the town (n = 0)?
   **Answer:** Return `-1` since it's not possible to have a town judge without any people.

2. **Question:** Can there be multiple trust relationships for the same person in the `trust` list?
   **Answer:** Yes, a person can trust multiple other people but in the context of the town judge problem, it does not affect the criterion where a town judge trusts nobody.

3. **Question:** Is it possible for the `trust` array to be empty?
   **Answer:** Yes, if `trust` is empty and `n` is 1, the single individual is by definition the town judge.

### Strategy

1. **Understand the trust relationships:** 
   - Use an array to count the number of people each person trusts.
   - Use another array to count how many people trust each person.

2. **Determine the town judge:** 
   - The town judge must trust nobody (should have a trust count of `0`).
   - The town judge must be trusted by exactly `n-1` people.

3. **Iterate over the counts to find the town judge:**
   - Check for the conditions in the trust counts array to identify the judge.

### Code

```java
public class FindTownJudge {
    public int findJudge(int n, int[][] trust) {
        if (n == 0) return -1;
        if (trust.length == 0 && n == 1) return 1;

        int[] trustCount = new int[n + 1];
        int[] trustedByCount = new int[n + 1];

        for (int[] t : trust) {
            trustCount[t[0]]++;
            trustedByCount[t[1]]++;
        }

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (trustCount[i] == 0 && trustedByCount[i] == n - 1) {
                return i;
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FindTownJudge solution = new FindTownJudge();
        int[][] trust = { {1, 2}, {2, 3}, {3, 1} };
        int result = solution.findJudge(3, trust);
        System.out.println(result); // Outputs: -1
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The solution iterates through the `trust` array once (O(m)), where `m` is the number of trust relationships. Then, it iterates through the list of people once (O(n)). Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(m + n).
  
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(n) for the arrays that are used to count the trust relationships.
