[Leetcode 1095. Find in Mountain Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1095)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `arr` that is `mountain array` and an integer `target`. Your goal is to return the minimum index such that `arr[index] == target`. If such an index does not exist, return -1.

A mountain array is defined as an array that:
1. Consists of at least three elements.
2. Has a peak element such that:
   - Array elements strictly increasing before the peak.
   - Array elements strictly decreasing after the peak.

You can assume that `arr` will always be a valid mountain array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Limits:**
   - What is the size range of the array `arr`?
   - What are the possible values for the elements in the array?
   
2. **Duplicates:**
   - Can there be duplicate values, especially with respect to the target?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What happens if the target is not present?

Assumptions:
- The length of `arr` is at least 3.
- The elements of `arr` are integers within the range `[-10^4, 10^4]`.
- Duplicates in terms of value but not peak property.
- If the target is not found, return -1.

### Strategy

1. **Identify the Peak:**
   - Use binary search to find the peak index where the array changes from increasing to decreasing.
   
2. **Binary Search on Subarrays:**
   - Perform binary search on the increasing part of the array up to the peak.
   - If the target is not found, perform binary search on the decreasing part after the peak.

### Code

Here's the Java code to solve this problem:

```java
interface MountainArray {
    public int get(int index);
    public int length();
}

public class Solution {
    public int findInMountainArray(int target, MountainArray mountainArr) {
        int n = mountainArr.length();
        
        // Find the peak index
        int peak = findPeakIndex(mountainArr, 0, n - 1);
        
        // Try to find the target in the increasing part
        int index = binarySearch(mountainArr, target, 0, peak, true);
        if (index != -1) {
            return index;
        }
        
        // Try to find the target in the decreasing part
        return binarySearch(mountainArr, target, peak + 1, n - 1, false);
    }
    
    private int findPeakIndex(MountainArray mountainArr, int left, int right) {
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (mountainArr.get(mid) < mountainArr.get(mid + 1)) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
    
    private int binarySearch(MountainArray mountainArr, int target, int left, int right, boolean ascending) {
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            int value = mountainArr.get(mid);
            if (value == target) {
                return mid;
            }
            if (ascending) {
                if (value < target) {
                    left = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    right = mid - 1;
                }
            } else {
                if (value > target) {
                    left = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    right = mid - 1;
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Finding the Peak:** O(log n) because it involves binary search.
- **Binary Search on Subarrays:** Each binary search takes O(log n), and we perform up to two binary searches.

Overall, the time complexity is O(log n) + O(log n) = O(log n).

- **Space Complexity:** O(1) as we use a constant amount of extra space.

By leveraging binary search both to find the peak and to search for the target in the two segments of the array, we achieve an efficient solution.
