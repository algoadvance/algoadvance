[Leetcode 2749. Minimum Operations to Make the Integer Zero](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2749)
## Problem Statement

You are given two integers `num1` and `num2`. In one operation, you can choose integer `i` in the range `[0, 60]` and subtract `num2 * 2^i` from `num1`.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make `num1` equal to `0`.

If it is impossible to achieve `num1` equal to `0`, return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `num1` or `num2` be negative?**
   - No, based on the problem constraints, both `num1` and `num2` are positive integers.
   
2. **Is there a limit to the number of operations we can perform?**
   - The problem does not specify a limit on the number of operations.

3. **What is the range of the input values?**
   - Both `num1` and `num2` can be any integer within the range of typical 32-bit integer values.

4. **Do `i` values have to be distinct, or can we use the same `i` multiple times?**
   - The problem does not limit the reuse of `i`, so you can use the same `i` multiple times to achieve the goal.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to repeatedly subtract `num2 * 2^i` from `num1` until `num1` becomes zero, using the minimum number of operations.

Steps:
1. Start with the highest possible value of `i` (i.e., 60) and check if `num2 * 2^i` can be subtracted from `num1`.
2. If it can, perform the subtraction and count the operation.
3. Repeat the process with decreasing values of `i` until `num1` becomes zero.
4. If `num1` cannot be made zero by the time you reach `i = 0`, return `-1`.

This greedy approach ensures that we always subtract the largest possible value in each operation, minimizing the total number of operations.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity is O(1) because the maximum number of iterations is fixed at 61 (from `i = 60` to `i = 0`).

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int num1, int num2) {
        int operations = 0;
        
        for (int i = 60; i >= 0; i--) {
            long value = (long) num2 << i; // num2 * 2^i
            while (num1 >= value) {
                num1 -= value;
                operations++;
            }
            if (num1 == 0) return operations;
        }
        
        return -1; // If num1 is not zero by the end
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.minOperations(100, 2)); // Sample test case
    }
}
```

In this code:
1. We iterate from `i = 60` down to `i = 0`.
2. In each iteration, we check if `num2 * 2^i` can be subtracted from `num1`.
3. If so, we subtract and increment the operation count.
4. The loop continues until either `num1` becomes zero or we exhaust all possible values of `i`.

This solution ensures all requirements of minimizing operations are met effectively.
