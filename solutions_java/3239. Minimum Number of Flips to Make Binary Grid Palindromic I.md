[Leetcode 3239. Minimum Number of Flips to Make Binary Grid Palindromic I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3239)
### Problem Statement:

Given a square binary grid where each cell contains `0` or `1`, your task is to find the minimum number of flips required to make the grid palindromic. A grid is palindromic if it reads the same forwards as backwards both row-wise and column-wise.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input/Output Format:**
   - **Input:** A 2D array (square grid) of integers (either `0` or `1`).
   - **Output:** An integer representing the minimum number of flips required to make the grid palindromic.

2. **Constraints:**
   - The grid is square: N x N, where 1 <= N <= 50.
   - Each cell in the grid contains either `0` or `1`.

### Strategy:

To make the grid palindromic, each cell `grid[i][j]` should match:
1. `grid[i][N-j-1]` (Horizontal symmetry)
2. `grid[N-i-1][j]` (Vertical symmetry)
3. `grid[N-i-1][N-j-1]` (Central symmetry)

Given these symmetries, we should count how many cells need to be flipped in order to achieve the required properties. The required value for each group of four corresponding cells will be the majority value among them for minimal flips.

We will iterate over all four-cell groups in the first quadrant of the grid and ensure that they match. We will count and sum up the number of necessary flips for each group to achieve the palindrome property.

### Code:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minFlips(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        int flips = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < (n + 1) / 2; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < (n + 1) / 2; j++) {
                // Gather the group of 4 corresponding symmetrical cells
                int[] vals = new int[4];
                vals[0] = grid[i][j];
                vals[1] = grid[i][n - j - 1];
                vals[2] = grid[n - i - 1][j];
                vals[3] = grid[n - i - 1][n - j - 1];
                
                // Count the number of 1s and 0s in these 4 cells
                int countZero = 0;
                int countOne = 0;
                for (int val : vals) {
                    if (val == 0) {
                        countZero++;
                    } else {
                        countOne++;
                    }
                }
                
                // To make them identical, flip the fewer number of cells
                flips += Math.min(countZero, countOne);
            }
        }
        
        return flips;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[][] grid = {
            {0, 1, 0},
            {1, 0, 1},
            {0, 1, 0}
        };
        System.out.println(sol.minFlips(grid));  // Output should depend on the grid provided
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

Each cell is part of exactly one group of four symmetrical cells, and each iteration of our nested loop considers one such group.

- **Time Complexity:** `O(N^2)`, where `N` is the size of the grid.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as we only use a constant amount of extra space aside from the input grid.

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the minimum number of flips needed to make the grid palindromic.
