[Leetcode 1467. Probability of a Two Boxes Having The Same Number of Distinct Balls](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1467)
### Problem Statement

You have two boxes with `n` distinct balls. The balls are numbered from `1` to `n`. Ball `i` has a specific number of copies denoted by `ballCount[i]`.

You are required to place all the balls into the two boxes `A` and `B` such that the probability of both boxes having the same number of distinct balls is maximized.

Return the probability in float form.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format**:
   - Is the ball count provided as an array?
     - **Yes**, the ball counts are provided as an integer array `ballCount`.
2. **Distinct Balls**:
   - Are we only looking for the number of distinct balls in each box, not the specific distribution?
     - **Correct**, we only care about the count of distinct balls in each box.

### Strategy

The problem can be broken down into recursive exploration of the distribution of balls into two boxes A and B. The goal is to calculate the number of successful distributions where both boxes have the same number of distinct balls and divide it by the total number of possible distributions.

1. **Recursive Distribution**:
   - Create a recursive function to explore all possible ways to place balls in boxes A and B.
   - Keep track of the number of ways this results in both boxes having the same number of distinct balls.

2. **Validation Criteria**:
   - During the distribution process, each recursive call should update the distinct ball count for both boxes.
   - Ensure that once all balls are placed, the number of distinct balls in both boxes is compared.

3. **Probability Calculation**:
   - Calculate the total number of successful distributions.
   - Calculate the total number of ways to distribute the balls.
   - The probability is the ratio of successful distributions to total distributions.

### Code

Here's the Java code implementing the above strategy:

```java
public class ProbabilityOfTwoBoxes {
    private int totalWays = 0;
    private int successfulWays = 0;

    public double getProbability(int[] balls) {
        int n = balls.length;
        distributeBalls(balls, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0);
        return (double) successfulWays / totalWays;
    }

    private void distributeBalls(int[] balls, int index, int aCount, int bCount, int aDistinct, int bDistinct, int totalBalls) {
        if (index == balls.length) {
            if (aCount == bCount && aDistinct == bDistinct) {
                successfulWays++;
            }
            totalWays++;
            return;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i <= balls[index]; i++) {
            int newACount = aCount + i;
            int newBCount = bCount + (balls[index] - i);
            int newADistinct = aDistinct + (i > 0 ? 1 : 0);
            int newBDistinct = bDistinct + ((balls[index] - i) > 0 ? 1 : 0);

            distributeBalls(balls, index + 1, newACount, newBCount, newADistinct, newBDistinct, totalBalls + balls[index]);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ProbabilityOfTwoBoxes obj = new ProbabilityOfTwoBoxes();
        int[] balls = {1, 1, 2};
        System.out.println("Probability: " + obj.getProbability(balls));
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach can be quite high due to the recursive exploration of all possible ways to distribute the balls. Specifically:

- **Worst Case**: O(2^n * n) where `n` is the number of distinct ball types. This is because for each ball type, we explore multiple ways to split it between boxes A and B. The overall number of states grows exponentially with n.
