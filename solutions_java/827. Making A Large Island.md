[Leetcode 827. Making A Large Island](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l827)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `n x n` binary matrix `grid`. You are allowed to change at most one `0` to be `1`.

You need to find the size of the largest island (i.e., the largest group of connected `1`s) that can be obtained by changing at most one `0` to `1`.

An island is a group of `1`s connected 4-directionally (horizontal or vertical). You may assume all four edges of the grid are surrounded by water.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the size of the grid?**
   - Typical constraints for such grid problems fall within \(1 ≤ n ≤ 500\), but this needs to be confirmed by checking the problem constraints in the actual problem statement.

2. **Can the grid have all 1's or all 0's?**
   - Yes, it is possible for the grid to have all 1's or all 0's.

3. **Do we need to consider cases where no zero exists in the grid or where we do not flip any zero?**
   - Yes, if the grid has no zero or flipping a zero does not yield a larger island, those cases should be considered.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can employ the following strategy:

1. Use DFS or BFS to find all islands and their sizes. Tag each island with a unique index.
2. Store the size of each island in a map.
3. For each zero in the grid, calculate the potential size of the island if that zero is flipped to one.
4. Track the largest potential island size found.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    int[][] directions = \ use example from above
    
    public int largestIsland(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        
        int index = 2; // start indexing islands from 2
        Map<Integer, Integer> islandSize = new HashMap<>();
        boolean hasZero = false;
        
        // First, find all island sizes.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    int size = dfs(grid, i, j, index);
                    islandSize.put(index, size);
                    index++;
                } else {
                    hasZero = true;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // If there are no zeroes, return the full grid size 
        if (!hasZero) return n * n;
        
        int maxIsland = 0;
        
        // Try flipping each 0 to 1 and calculate the new island size.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 0) {
                    Set<Integer> seenIslands = new HashSet<>();
                    int newSize = 1; // Flipping this 0 to 1
                    
                    for (int[] dir : directions) {
                        int ni = i + dir[0], nj = j + dir[1];
                        if (ni >= 0 && ni < n && nj >= 0 && nj < n && grid[ni][nj] > 1) {
                            int islandIndex = grid[ni][nj];
                            if (!seenIslands.contains(islandIndex)) {
                                newSize += islandSize.get(islandIndex);
                                seenIslands.add(islandIndex);
                            }
                        }
                    }
                    maxIsland = Math.max(maxIsland, newSize);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return maxIsland;
    }
    
    private int dfs(int[][] grid, int x, int y, int index) {
        int n = grid.length;
        if (x < 0 || x >= n || y < 0 || y >= n || grid[x][y] != 1) return 0;
        
        grid[x][y] = index; // Mark the land
        int size = 1;
        
        for (int[] dir : directions) {
            size += dfs(grid, x + dir[0], y + dir[1], index);
        }
        
        return size;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **DFS for marking islands**: \(O(n^2)\) since we visit each cell once.
- **Processing each cell (zero flipping check)**: \(O(n^2)\) where for each zero, we check its 4 neighbors.
- Overall time complexity is \(O(n^2)\).

This strategy ensures that we efficiently compute the largest possible island size one can get by flipping at most one `0` to `1`.
