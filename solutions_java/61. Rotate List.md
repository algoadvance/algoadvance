[Leetcode 61. Rotate List full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l61)
## Problem Statement

Given the head of a linked list, rotate the list to the right by `k` places.

### Example:
- Input: `head = [1,2,3,4,5]`, `k = 2`
- Output: `[4,5,1,2,3]`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the expected output if `k` is 0?**
   - The list should remain unchanged.

2. **What if the list is empty or has only one node?**
   - For an empty list, return the empty list.
   - For a single-node list, return the list as is.

3. **Is `k` always a positive integer?**
   - Not necessarily, `k` can be 0 or any non-negative integer.

4. **Should we consider very large values of `k`?**
   - Yes, `k` can be larger than the length of the list, we will rotate it `k % len(list)` times as rotating a list with its length results in the same list.

## Strategy

1. **Determine the length of the list.**
   - Traverse the linked list to determine its length.

2. **Connect the list into a circular one.**
   - By connecting the last node to the head, we form a circular list.

3. **Calculate the effective number of rotations needed.**
   - Since rotating a list by its length results in the same list, the effective rotations needed can be found using `k % length`.

4. **Find the new tail and disconnect the circle.**
   - The new tail will be at position `length - (k % length) - 1`.
   - The new head will be the node after the new tail.

5. **Disconnect the circle and set the next of the new tail to null.**

## Code

```java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

public class RotateList {
    public ListNode rotateRight(ListNode head, int k) {
        // Edge case: empty list
        if (head == null || head.next == null || k == 0) return head;

        // Determine the length of the list
        ListNode oldTail = head;
        int length = 1;
        while (oldTail.next != null) {
            oldTail = oldTail.next;
            length++;
        }

        // Create a circular list
        oldTail.next = head;

        // Effective rotations needed
        k = k % length;
        int newTailPos = length - k - 1;
        
        // Find the new tail
        ListNode newTail = head;
        for (int i = 0; i < newTailPos; i++) {
            newTail = newTail.next;
        }

        // Find the new head
        ListNode newHead = newTail.next;

        // Break the circle
        newTail.next = null;

        return newHead;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N)
  - Where N is the number of nodes in the linked list. We traverse the list to find its length, and again to find the new tail and disconnect the circle.

- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - We are using a constant amount of extra space.
