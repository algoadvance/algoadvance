[Leetcode 2331. Evaluate Boolean Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2331)
### Problem Statement

Given the `root` of a **full binary tree**, you need to evaluate the value of this binary tree. In a **full binary tree**, each node has either 0 or 2 children. Leaves (nodes with 0 children) have either the value `0` or `1`. Non-leaf nodes have either the value `2` representing a logical OR, or the value `3` representing a logical AND.

The evaluation of the tree is defined as follows:
- A leaf node evaluates to its value, either `0` or `1`.
- A non-leaf node with value `2` represents a logical OR and evaluates to the logical OR of its two children.
- A non-leaf node with value `3` represents a logical AND and evaluates to the logical AND of its two children.

Return the Boolean result of evaluating the root node.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What type of TreeNode structure should we use?**
   - Assume a TreeNode class is provided with the following definition:
     ```java
     class TreeNode {
         int val;
         TreeNode left;
         TreeNode right;
         TreeNode() {}
         TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
         TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
             this.val = val;
             this.left = left;
             this.right = right;
         }
     }
     ```

2. **What kind of result should be returned?**
   - Return a boolean result indicating the value of the evaluated binary tree.

3. **How should the logical operators work?**
   - For OR (node value `2`), if either of the child nodes evaluates to `true`, the node evaluates to `true`.
   - For AND (node value `3`), both child nodes must evaluate to `true` for the node to evaluate to `true`.

### Strategy
1. **Base Case (Leaf Evaluation)**:
   - If a node has no children (leaf), return its value converted to a boolean (`0` to `false`, `1` to `true`).

2. **Recursive Case (Non-leaf Evaluation)**:
   - Recursively evaluate both the left and right children.
   - Apply the logical operator based on the node's value (`2` for OR, `3` for AND).

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean evaluateTree(TreeNode root) {
        return evaluate(root);
    }

    private boolean evaluate(TreeNode node) {
        // Base case: if it is a leaf node
        if (node.left == null && node.right == null) {
            return node.val == 1;
        }
        
        // Recursively evaluate left and right children
        boolean leftVal = evaluate(node.left);
        boolean rightVal = evaluate(node.right);
        
        // Non-leaf node values: 2 for OR, 3 for AND
        if (node.val == 2) {
            return leftVal || rightVal;
        } else if (node.val == 3) {
            return leftVal && rightVal;
        }
        
        // For completeness, although we'll never end up here due to problem constraints
        return false;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. 

- We're visiting each node exactly once to evaluate it.
- The recursion ensures that both subtrees of every node are visited.

Thus, the solution efficiently evaluates the binary tree using depth-first search.
