[Leetcode 984. String Without AAA or BBB full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l984)
### Problem Statement:
Given two integers `a` and `b`, return any string `s` such that:
- `s` has length `a + b` and contains exactly `a` 'a' letters, and exactly `b` 'b' letters,
- The substring "aaa" does not occur in `s`,
- The substring "bbb" does not occur in `s`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Is there a guaranteed possible solution for every pair of `a` and `b`?**
   Yes, because it is always possible to create a string without having three consecutive identical letters as long as the length of the string is equal to the sum of `a` and `b`.

2. **Can we assume the input values `a` and `b` are non-negative integers?**
   Yes.

3. **Are `a` and `b` both within a reasonable input limit for manual string building in a language like Java?**
   Assumptions are made that the input size is reasonable (e.g., up to a few thousand).

### Strategy:
1. **Initialization**: Start with empty string `result`.
2. **Distribute Characters**:
   - Always add the character that currently has the larger remaining count unless it will form "aaa" or "bbb".
   - Alternate between adding 'a' and 'b' while ensuring that no three consecutive identical characters are added.
3. **Balancing**:
   - As we add characters, ensure that we reduce the remaining counts of `a` and `b` appropriately.
   - Handle edge cases where the counts are equal and distribution should be even.
4. **Construct Result**: Ensure the final string meets all the given criteria.

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(a + b)\) since we are iterating through a fixed number of characters to form the result string of length `a + b`.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(a + b)\) for storing the result string.

### Code:

```java
public class Solution {
    public String strWithout3a3b(int a, int b) {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder(a + b);
        while (a > 0 || b > 0) {
            boolean writeA = false;
            int m = result.length();
            if (m >= 2 && result.charAt(m - 1) == result.charAt(m - 2)) {
                if (result.charAt(m - 1) == 'b') {
                    writeA = true;
                }
            } else {
                if (a >= b) {
                    writeA = true;
                }
            }
            
            if (writeA) {
                result.append('a');
                a--;
            } else {
                result.append('b');
                b--;
            }
        }
        return result.toString();
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
1. **Loop through until all characters are added**: Continue adding 'a' or 'b' until the sum of lengths of characters added equals \(a + b\).
2. **Decide which character to add**:
   - If the last two characters in the result are the same, avoid adding the same character.
   - Prefer adding 'a' if there are more 'a's left, otherwise add 'b'.
3. **Append Character and Decrement Counter**: Add the chosen character to the result and decrement its respective counter (`a` or `b`).

This ensures that the resulting string neither contains "aaa" nor "bbb" and is exactly of length \(a + b\).
