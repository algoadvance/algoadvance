## Problem Statement

**788. Rotated Digits**

X is a good number if after rotating each digit individually by 180 degrees, we get a valid digit and the result is different from X. Each digit must be rotated - we cannot choose to leave it alone.

A number is valid if each digit becomes another digit after rotation, where the digits are:

- 0 rotates to 0
- 1 rotates to 1
- 8 rotates to 8
- 2 rotates to 5
- 5 rotates to 2
- 6 rotates to 9
- 9 rotates to 6

However, the digits 3, 4, and 7 are not valid after rotation.

Given an integer `N`, return the number of good numbers in the range [1, N].

### Example

```plaintext
Input: N = 10
Output: 4
Explanation: There are four good numbers in the range [1, 10] : 2, 5, 6, 9.
Note that 1 and 10 are not good numbers, since they remain unchanged after rotation.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the input N always a positive integer?**
   - Yes, you can assume that N is a positive integer.

2. **Are there any constraints on the value of N?**
   - The problem statement does not specify, but typical constraints for similar problems range up to 10,000.

3. **Do we need to handle any edge cases such as zero?**
   - No, since N is always positive, we do not need to handle zero.

4. **How should we handle large values of N in terms of performance?**
   - We should aim for an efficient solution, ideally linear in complexity given the constraints.

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Create a map or method to transform digits according to the 180-degree rotation rules.
2. **Validation**: Define a method to check if a number is a 'good number' by validating each digit.
3. **Count Good Numbers**: Iterate from 1 to N, checking if each number is good and count them.

### Pseudocode

1. Create a list or set of valid digits that transform into other valid digits.
2. Create a method `isGoodNumber` to check the validity of each number.
3. Iterate through the numbers from 1 to N and use `isGoodNumber` to count how many are good.

## Code

```java
public class RotatedDigits {
    public int rotatedDigits(int N) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
            if (isGoodNumber(i)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    private boolean isGoodNumber(int n) {
        boolean isValid = false;
        while (n > 0) {
            int d = n % 10;
            if (d == 3 || d == 4 || d == 7) {
                return false;
            }
            if (d == 2 || d == 5 || d == 6 || d == 9) {
                isValid = true;
            }
            n /= 10;
        }
        return isValid;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RotatedDigits solution = new RotatedDigits();
        System.out.println(solution.rotatedDigits(10));  // Output: 4
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N * d), where d is the number of digits in the number. In the worst case, this can be considered approximately O(N log N).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using a constant amount of extra space.
