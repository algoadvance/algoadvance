[Leetcode 2014. Longest Subsequence Repeated k Times](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2014)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, find the longest subsequence repeated `k` times in `s`. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the string `s` and the integer `k`?**
   - It is advisable to understand the maximum length of `s` and the range of `k` to choose an appropriate algorithm.

2. **Can `k` be 1?**
   - If so, the problem simplifies since any non-empty string is a subsequence repeated 1 time.

3. **What should be returned if no such subsequence exists?**
   - Clarification on whether to return an empty string or some other indication.

4. **Are there any specific characters allowed in the string `s`?**
   - To understand if there are only ASCII characters or it includes Unicode characters as well.

5. **What should be returned if there are multiple subsequences with the same maximum length?**
   - Clarification on tie-breaking rules (like lexicographical order).

### Strategy

To find the longest subsequence that can be repeated `k` times in the given string `s`, break the problem down into the following steps:

1. **Subsequence Generation**: Generate all possible subsequences of `s`.
2. **Validation**: Check if a subsequence can be repeated `k` times in `s`.
3. **Selection**: Keep track of the longest valid subsequence.
4. **Optimization**: Because generating all subsequences isn't feasible for long strings, consider looking at only subsequences of possible lengths using binary search techniques or greedy algorithms to find maximum candidates efficiently.
5. **Lexicographical Order**: If multiple valid subsequences are of the same maximum length, return the lexicographically smallest one.

### Time Complexity

The overall time complexity would be quite high if generating all subsequences. An optimized approach using a subset of subsequences and checking their repeats can aim at reducing the complexity.

### Implementation

Below is a Java implementation considering the constraints and discussed strategy:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public String longestSubsequenceRepeatedK(String s, int k) {
        int n = s.length();
        String result = "";
        
        // helper function to check if a given string t can be subsequence of s at least k times
        boolean canBeSubsequenceKTimes(String t, String s, int k) {
            int j = 0, count = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
                if (s.charAt(i) == t.charAt(j)) {
                    j++;
                    if (j == t.length()) {
                        j = 0;
                        count++;
                    }
                }
                if (count == k) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
            return false;
        }
        
        // generate all possible combinations of size between 1 to n/k
        // and check if they can be a valid candidate
        List<String> candidates = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int len = 1; len <= n / k; len++) {
            generateCombinations(s.toCharArray(), "", 0, len, candidates);
        }
        
        // check each candidate and keep track of the longest valid one
        for (String candidate : candidates) {
            if (canBeSubsequenceKTimes(candidate, s, k)) {
                if (candidate.length() > result.length() || 
                    (candidate.length() == result.length() && candidate.compareTo(result) < 0)) {
                    result = candidate;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    // Helper function to generate combinations
    void generateCombinations(char[] s, String prefix, int start, int len, List<String> result) {
        if (len == 0) {
            result.add(prefix);
            return;
        }
        for (int i = start; i <= s.length - len; i++) {
            generateCombinations(s, prefix + s[i], i + 1, len - 1, result);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        String s = "banana";
        int k = 2;
        System.out.println(sol.longestSubsequenceRepeatedK(s, k)); // Expected output: "an"
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity Analysis

1. **Subsequence Generation**: Generating subsequences for all lengths up to n/k results in a combinatorial explosion that is manageable only for small n.
2. **Validation**: Each validation across the string takes O(n) time.
3. **Aggregated**: Overall, the approach is combinatorial but leverages pruning to handle moderately sized strings.

Keep an eye on constraints and optimize parts of the approach to handle larger input sizes efficiently.
