[Leetcode 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l19)
## Problem Statement

You are given the head of a linked list, and an integer `n`. Remove the nth node from the end of the list and return its head.

**Example:**
```
Given linked list: 1->2->3->4->5, and n = 2.
After removing the second node from the end, the linked list becomes 1->2->3->5.
```

**Constraints:**
1. The number of nodes in the list is `sz`.
2. `1 <= sz <= 30`
3. `0 <= Node.val <= 100`
4. `1 <= n <= sz`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can we assume that the given linked list is always valid and non-empty?
   **A:** Yes, the constraints ensure that the list contains at least one node.

2. **Q:** What should we return if `n` equals the length of the linked list?
   **A:** We should remove the head of the list.

3. **Q:** Can `n` be zero or out of range?
   **A:** No, according to the constraints `1 <= n <= sz`.

## Strategy

1. **Two-Pointer Approach (Fast and Slow)**
    - Use two pointers: `fast` and `slow`.
    - Move the `fast` pointer `n` steps ahead first.
    - Move both `fast` and `slow` simultaneously until `fast` reaches the end of the list.
    - Remove the node after the `slow` pointer.

2. **Steps:**
    - Create a dummy node and point its next to the head (to handle edge case easily).
    - Initialize both `fast` and `slow` to the dummy node.
    - Move `fast` `n` steps forward.
    - Move both `fast` and `slow` simultaneously until `fast.next` is `null`.
    - Set `slow.next` to `slow.next.next` to bypass the node to be removed.
    - Return `dummy.next`.

## Code

```java
// Definition for singly-linked list.
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode() {}
    ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
    ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
}

public class Solution {
    public ListNode removeNthFromEnd(ListNode head, int n) {
        // Create a dummy node and point its next to head
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;

        // Initialize the fast and slow pointers
        ListNode fast = dummy;
        ListNode slow = dummy;

        // Move the fast pointer n steps ahead
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            fast = fast.next;
        }

        // Move both pointers until the fast.next is null
        while (fast.next != null) {
            fast = fast.next;
            slow = slow.next;
        }

        // Remove the nth node from end
        slow.next = slow.next.next;

        // Return the head which dummy.next points to
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(L), where L is the length of the linked list. This is because we are traversing the list twice in succession (once for `fast` pointer moving `n` steps and another traversal for both pointers).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
