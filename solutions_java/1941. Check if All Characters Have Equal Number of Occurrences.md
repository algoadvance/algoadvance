[Leetcode 1941. Check if All Characters Have Equal Number of Occurrences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1941)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, determine if all characters have the same frequency of occurrence in the string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
    - Is the input string `s` always non-empty?
    - What is the maximum possible length of the string `s`?

2. **Character Types:**
    - Are the characters limited to lowercase and uppercase English letters, or can they include other characters?

Assuming the input string `s` can contain only lowercase English letters and has a maximum length of `105`.

### Example
- Example 1: 
  - Input: "abacbc"
  - Output: true (`'a', 'b', 'c'` all appear 2 times)

- Example 2: 
  - Input: "aaabb"
  - Output: false (`'a'` appears 3 times while `'b'` appears 2 times)

### Strategy
1. **Count Frequency:**
   - Use a HashMap to count the frequency of each character in the string.
2. **Check Equality:**
   - Traverse through the HashMap values and ensure all have the same value.

### Code
```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public boolean areOccurrencesEqual(String s) {
        // Step 1: Count frequency of each character
        HashMap<Character, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            frequencyMap.put(c, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        // Step 2: Check if all frequencies are the same
        int frequency = -1;  // Initialize to a value that no frequency will have.
        
        for (int count : frequencyMap.values()) {
            if (frequency == -1) {
                frequency = count;  // Set the frequency upon encountering the first entry
            } else if (frequency != count) {
                return false;  // If any frequency doesn't match, return false
            }
        }
        
        return true;  // All frequencies matched
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string. Each character is processed once to count frequencies and then verified.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, since the HashMap will at most store counts for 26 different characters (assuming the input consists exclusively of lowercase English letters).

### Conclusion
The provided solution efficiently counts character frequencies and checks for equality. The time complexity ensures scalability for large input sizes within the given constraints.
