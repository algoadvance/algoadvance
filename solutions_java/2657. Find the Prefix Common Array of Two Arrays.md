[Leetcode 2657. Find the Prefix Common Array of Two Arrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2657)
### Problem Statement

You are given two **0-indexed integer** arrays `A` and `B` of length `n`. The **prefix common array** of `A` and `B` is an array `C` such that `C[i]` is equal to the count of numbers which are present in both the prefix of `A` and the prefix of `B` up to index `i`.

Formally, `C[i]` is the number of elements present in both the prefix of `A` (`A[0]`, `A[1]`, ..., `A[i]`) and the prefix of `B` (`B[0]`, `B[1]`, ..., `B[i]`).

Return the prefix common array of `A` and `B`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of possible values for elements in arrays `A` and `B`?**
   - Assumption is from problem constraints or typical Leetcode conventions.

2. **Are there any constraints guaranteeing that the values in `A` and `B` are unique?**
   - No explicit constraints, so assume `A` and `B` can contain duplicate values.

3. **What is the range of `n`, the length of the arrays?**
   - Assume `n` is reasonably large due to typical coding challenge patterns in Leetcode.

### Strategy

1. We need to iterate through each index `i` of the arrays `A` and `B`.
2. Maintain two sets to store the elements encountered so far in the prefixes of `A` and `B`.
3. For each index `i`, update sets with the current element from A and B.
4. Calculate the intersection of the two sets to get the count of common elements up to index `i`.
5. Store this count in the resulting array `C`.

### Code

Here's the Java code to solve the problem:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;

public class Solution {
    public int[] findThePrefixCommonArray(int[] A, int[] B) {
        int n = A.length;
        int[] C = new int[n];
        HashSet<Integer> setA = new HashSet<>();
        HashSet<Integer> setB = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            setA.add(A[i]);
            setB.add(B[i]);
            
            // Count the common elements
            int commonCount = 0;
            for (Integer element : setA) {
                if (setB.contains(element)) {
                    commonCount++;
                }
            }
            
            C[i] = commonCount;
        }
        
        return C;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] A = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        int[] B = {1, 3, 2, 4};
        int[] result = sol.findThePrefixCommonArray(A, B);
        
        for (int num : result) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Iterating over prefixes up to index `i**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the arrays.
- **Intersection finding for each index `i`**: In the worst case, we might compare elements in sets of sizes up to `i`, leading to a quadratic complexity `O(i)`.
  - Overall worst-case time complexity: `O(n^2)` due to the nested loops checking set intersections.

### Optimization Consideration

To further improve performance, we can use a single pass and increment counters more efficiently by leveraging the fact that we only need to check membership without rebuilding set intersections. However, the given linear approach will be clear and adequate for small-to-moderate `n`.
