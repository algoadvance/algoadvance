[Leetcode 2866. Beautiful Towers II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2866)
### Problem Statement:

You have been given an array of integers `heights` representing the heights of towers. You can perform a series of operations on these towers, with each operation consisting of reducing the height of a particular tower by 1 unit. The goal is to make the towers "beautiful" as defined by the following criteria:

- A sequence of tower heights is beautiful if every height is positive and every pair of adjacent towers has heights differing by at most 1 unit.
  
For example, a sequence [3, 2, 1, 2, 3] is beautiful.

You need to determine the minimum number of operations required to make the given sequence of tower heights beautiful.

**Constraints:**
- The length of the array `heights` is between 1 and 10^5.
- Each element in `heights` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Can the height of any tower be reduced to zero?** 
   - No, since the problem states every height must be positive.
   
2. **Can we rearrange the towers to form a beautiful sequence?**
   - No, the order of towers must be maintained; only reductions in height are allowed.

3. **Is the input guaranteed to be such that it's possible to make it beautiful with the given operations?**
   - Yes, since the problem only asks for the minimum number of operations, we assume it's always possible.

### Strategy:

The strategy can be summarized as follows:

1. **Identify peaks and valleys:**
   - The goal is to reduce as few heights as possible to make the sequence beautiful.
   - Peaks or overly high points should be lowered to match their neighbors within the allowable range.
   
2. **Greedy approach:**
   - Traverse the array from left to right, ensuring that each height is at most 1 unit greater than the previous height.
   - Traverse the array from right to left, ensuring that each height is at most 1 unit greater than the next height.
   - The maximum value each tower can attain is the lowest height derived from the two greedy passes.

3. **Calculate operations:**
   - Finally, calculate the number of operations needed to match each tower to the derived beautiful heights.

### Code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class BeautifulTowersII {

    public int minOperations(int[] heights) {
        int n = heights.length;
        int[] left = new int[n];
        int[] right = new int[n];
        
        // Initialize the left pass with the heights themselves
        left[0] = heights[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            left[i] = Math.min(heights[i], left[i - 1] + 1);
        }
        
        // Initialize the right pass with the heights themselves
        right[n - 1] = heights[n - 1];
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            right[i] = Math.min(heights[i], right[i + 1] + 1);
        }
        
        // Find the minimum operations needed
        int minOperations = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int minHeight = Math.min(left[i], right[i]);
            minOperations += heights[i] - minHeight;
        }
        
        return minOperations;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BeautifulTowersII bt = new BeautifulTowersII();
        int[] heights = {3, 4, 5, 2, 1, 3, 3, 2};
        System.out.println(bt.minOperations(heights)); // Output example
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

The algorithm runs in linear time, O(n):

- The two traversals (left to right and right to left) each take O(n) time.
- The final loop to compute the total number of operations also takes O(n) time.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n).
