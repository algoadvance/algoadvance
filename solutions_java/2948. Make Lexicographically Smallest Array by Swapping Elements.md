[Leetcode 2948. Make Lexicographically Smallest Array by Swapping Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2948)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. You are allowed to swap any two elements in the array exactly once. Return the lexicographically smallest array that you can achieve.

**Example:**

1. Input: nums = [3, 2, 1]
   Output: [1, 2, 3]

2. Input: nums = [5, 8, 3, 6, 1]
   Output: [1, 8, 3, 6, 5]

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^3
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Clarification on Lexicographical Order:** To make sure, when we talk about lexicographically smallest array, do we mean the smallest order of numbers in the array similar to dictionary order?
2. **Single Swap:** Confirming that we are allowed only one swap operation regardless of array length.
3. **Return Array:** Confirm if the return type should be an array with the modified order instead of a string or some other form.

## Strategy

1. **Initial Observation:** 
   - The array should be modified minimally to obtain the smallest lexicographical order.
   - Since we can only swap two elements exactly once, we should identify the best possible swap to achieve this.

2. **Approach:**
   - Traverse the array and find the minimum element not at the initial position.
   - Check every pair of elements to see which swap yields the smallest result after swapping and make the swap.
   - Return the modified array.

## Code

Here is the Java code to solve the problem:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class LexicographicallySmallestArray {
    public static int[] makeLexicographicallySmallestArray(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int minIdx = 0;
        
        // Find the smallest element that is not at the first position
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] < nums[minIdx]) {
                minIdx = i;
            }
        }
        
        // If the smallest element is already at the first position
        if (minIdx == 0) {
            return nums;
        }

        // Trying to find the best swap
        int bestX = 0, bestY = minIdx;
        
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int[] smallestWithSwap = nums.clone();
        nums[bestX] = nums[bestY];
        nums[bestY] = smallestWithSwap[bestX];
        
        // Return the array with the smallest lexicographical order
        return nums;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums1 = {3, 2, 1};
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(makeLexicographicallySmallestArray(nums1))); // Output: [1, 2, 3]

        int[] nums2 = {5, 8, 3, 6, 1};
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(makeLexicographicallySmallestArray(nums2))); // Output: [1, 8, 3, 6, 5]
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity for finding the smallest element not at the front is O(n), where n is the length of the array.
- Sorting the array would take O(n log n) time.
- Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it O(n log n).

### Note:
- This solution attempts to consider swaps and may need additional iterations to finalize effective swap strategies if the current check isn't providing accurate lexicographical ordering.
- This solution is efficient given the constraints, but it may require further optimization for extremely large datasets.
