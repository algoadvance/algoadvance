[Leetcode 1957. Delete Characters to Make Fancy String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1957)
### Problem Statement
-----
Given a string `s`, delete the **minimum** number of characters from `s` such that no three consecutive characters are the same.

Return the final string after the deletion. 

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the string be empty or contain only one or two characters?**
   Yes, it can.
2. **Are there any constraints on the input string?**
   1 <= `s.length` <= 10^5.
3. **If the string is already a "fancy" string, do we return it as is?**
   Yes, return it as it is.

### Strategy
-----
- Use a `StringBuilder` to construct the resultant string.
- Traverse the input string and keep checking the last two characters of the `StringBuilder` to ensure no three consecutive characters are the same.
- If the last two characters in the resultant string and the current character from the input form three consecutive identical characters, skip appending the current character. Otherwise, append it.

### Code
```java
public class FancyString {
    public static String makeFancyString(String s) {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            int len = result.length();
            // Check if we need to append this character or not
            if (len >= 2 && result.charAt(len - 1) == c && result.charAt(len - 2) == c) {
                continue;
            }
            result.append(c);
        }
        
        return result.toString();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s1 = "leeetcode";
        String s2 = "aaabaaaa";
        String s3 = "aab";
        
        System.out.println(makeFancyString(s1)); // Output: "leetcode"
        System.out.println(makeFancyString(s2)); // Output: "aabaa"
        System.out.println(makeFancyString(s3)); // Output: "aab"
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
-----
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. We traverse the input string once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case for the `StringBuilder` if no characters are removed.

This solution is efficient and should work within the constraints provided.
