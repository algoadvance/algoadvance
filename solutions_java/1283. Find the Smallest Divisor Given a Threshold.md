[Leetcode 1283. Find the Smallest Divisor Given a Threshold](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1283)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `threshold`, we will choose a positive integer `divisor`, and we can transform `nums` by dividing each element by `divisor` and then rounding up to the nearest integer. The goal is to find the smallest divisor such that the sum of the transformed array is less than or equal to the `threshold`.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,2,5,9], threshold = 6
Output: 5

Input: nums = [2,3,5,7,11], threshold = 11
Output: 3

Input: nums = [19], threshold = 5
Output: 4
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`
- `nums` is a sorted array.
- `1 <= threshold <= 10^7`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can `threshold` be smaller than the length of `nums`?
   - Based on the constraints, it is possible, but it means the divisor must be quite large.
   
2. Are there any constraints on the maximum value of the divisor?
   - The divisor must be a positive integer, but its upper limit isn't specified in the problem. Our strategy will handle finding the smallest possible one.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we'll employ a binary search strategy to find the smallest divisor. The main steps include:

1. Define a helper function that calculates the transformed sum for a given divisor.
2. Use binary search to find the smallest divisor:
   - Initialize the lower bound as 1.
   - Initialize the upper bound as the maximum element in the `nums` array (since dividing by anything larger will result in immediate floor of 1 for every element).
   - Check the middle value, calculate the transformed sum, and adjust bounds accordingly until the smallest acceptable divisor is found.

## Code

Below is the Java code implementing the above plan:

```java
public class SmallestDivisor {
    public int smallestDivisor(int[] nums, int threshold) {
        int left = 1; // Minimum possible divisor
        int right = getMax(nums); // Maximum value in nums as initial upper bound
        
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (getTransformedSum(nums, mid) > threshold) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        
        return left;
    }
    
    // Helper function to calculate the maximum value in the input array
    private int getMax(int[] nums) {
        int max = nums[0];
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num > max) {
                max = num;
            }
        }
        return max;
    }
    
    // Helper function to compute the sum of the rounded up values after division
    private int getTransformedSum(int[] nums, int divisor) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            sum += (num + divisor - 1) / divisor; // Equivalent to Math.ceil(num / divisor)
        }
        return sum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SmallestDivisor solution = new SmallestDivisor();
        int[] nums1 = {1, 2, 5, 9};
        int threshold1 = 6;
        System.out.println(solution.smallestDivisor(nums1, threshold1)); // Output: 5
        
        int[] nums2 = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11};
        int threshold2 = 11;
        System.out.println(solution.smallestDivisor(nums2, threshold2)); // Output: 3
        
        int[] nums3 = {19};
        int threshold3 = 5;
        System.out.println(solution.smallestDivisor(nums3, threshold3)); // Output: 4
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Binary Search**:
  - We are doing a binary search over the range of potential divisors, which can be up to the maximum element in `nums`.
  - This makes the time complexity of the binary search `O(log(maxNum))`, where `maxNum` is the maximum value in the `nums` array.

- **Calculation of Transformed Sum**:
  - For each divisor, we need to iterate through the array to sum up the values, making this part `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of `nums`.

Combining both aspects, the overall time complexity is `O(n * log(maxNum))`. Given the constraints, this should be efficient and manageable within the limits.
