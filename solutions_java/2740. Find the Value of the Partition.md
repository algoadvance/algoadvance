[Leetcode 2740. Find the Value of the Partition](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2740)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, partition the array into two non-empty subarrays, `left` and `right`, such that:

- Every element in `left` is less than or equal to every element in `right`.
- `left` and `right` are non-empty.

Return the maximum possible value of `nums[left]`, where `nums[left]` is the largest element in `left`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size**: What is the size of the input array? This will help in optimizing the solution.
2. **Element Range**: What are the possible ranges of the elements in the `nums` array?
3. **Duplicates**: Can the array `nums` contain duplicate values?
4. **Edge Cases**: What should be returned if the input size is minimum (e.g., a two-element array)?

### Example
Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [5, 0, 3, 8, 6]
Output: 3
Explanation: left = [5, 0, 3], right = [8, 6]. The largest value in left is 3 and it's the maximum value that satisfies the condition.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,6,12]
Output: 1
Explanation: left = [1,1,1,0], right = [6,12]. The largest value in left is 1.
```

### Strategy
1. **Initialization**:
   - Create an array `max_left` where `max_left[i]` keeps track of the maximum value from the beginning of the array to index `i`.
   - Create an array `min_right` where `min_right[i]` keeps track of the minimum value from index `i` to the end of the array.

2. **Populating `max_left`**:
   - Iterate over the array to fill `max_left` where each element represents the maximum value up to that element in `nums`.

3. **Populating `min_right`**:
   - Iterate over the array in reverse to fill `min_right` where each element represents the minimum value from that element to the end of the array.

4. **Determining the Partition**:
   - Iterate over the array and find the highest value of `max_left[i]` where `max_left[i] <= min_right[i+1]`. This helps in determining the potential partition point.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int partitionArray(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        
        // max_left[i] will be the max value from nums[0] to nums[i]
        int[] max_left = new int[n];
        
        // min_right[i] will be the min value from nums[i] to nums[n-1]
        int[] min_right = new int[n];
        
        max_left[0] = nums[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            max_left[i] = Math.max(max_left[i - 1], nums[i]);
        }
        
        min_right[n - 1] = nums[n - 1];
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            min_right[i] = Math.min(min_right[i + 1], nums[i]);
        }
        
        // Find the partition point
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (max_left[i] <= min_right[i + 1]) {
                return max_left[i];
            }
        }
        
        return -1; // according to problem constraints, this wouldn't occur
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the `max_left` and `min_right` arrays.
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), as we are iterating through the array three times (once for filling `max_left`, once for filling `min_right`, and once for finding the partition point).
