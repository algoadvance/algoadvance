[Leetcode 363. Max Sum of Rectangle No Larger Than K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l363)
### Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` matrix `matrix` and an integer `k`, return the maximal sum of a rectangle in the matrix such that its sum is no larger than `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What are the typical values of `m` and `n`?
   - Can the integers in the matrix be negative?

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - What should be returned if no such rectangle exists?
   - Should the solution print the rectangle or just the sum?

3. **Complexity Constraints**:
   - What are the constraints on time complexity for the solution?
   
Assuming typical constraints from Leetcode:

- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `-100 <= matrix[i][j] <= 100`
- `-10^5 <= k <= 10^5`

### Strategy

To find the maximum sum of a subrectangle no larger than `k`, we can utilize a strategy that involves:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - Calculate prefix sums for easier rectangle sum calculation.

2. **Iterate Through Pair of Columns**:
   - For each pair of columns, reduce the problem to a one-dimensional array subproblem.
   
3. **Maximum Subarray Sum No Larger Than K**:
   - Use a data structure to find the maximum subarray sum no larger than `k` efficiently within these columns.

The key part is to keep track of row sums between the column pairs and use a sorted collection to check sums efficiently.

### Code

```java
import java.util.TreeSet;

public class MaxSumRectangleNoLargerThanK {
    
    public int maxSumSubmatrix(int[][] matrix, int k) {
        int m = matrix.length;
        int n = matrix[0].length;
        int maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        for (int startCol = 0; startCol < n; startCol++) {
            int[] rowSums = new int[m];
            for (int endCol = startCol; endCol < n; endCol++) {
                for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
                    rowSums[i] += matrix[i][endCol];
                }
                maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, maxSumSubarrayNoLargerThanK(rowSums, k));
            }
        }
        
        return maxSum;
    }

    private int maxSumSubarrayNoLargerThanK(int[] array, int k) {
        int maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int prefixSum = 0;
        TreeSet<Integer> prefixSums = new TreeSet<>();
        prefixSums.add(0);
        
        for (int value : array) {
            prefixSum += value;
            Integer target = prefixSums.ceiling(prefixSum - k);
            if (target != null) {
                maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, prefixSum - target);
            }
            prefixSums.add(prefixSum);
        }
        
        return maxSum;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaxSumRectangleNoLargerThanK solver = new MaxSumRectangleNoLargerThanK();
        int[][] matrix = {
            {1, 0, 1},
            {0, -2, 3}
        };
        int k = 2;
        System.out.println(solver.maxSumSubmatrix(matrix, k)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Outer Loops**: We iterate through pairs of columns, resulting in approximately `O(n^2)` complexity.
2. **Inner Calculation**: For each pair of columns, summing up and finding the max subarray sum no larger than k takes `O(m log m)` due to the TreeSet operations being logarithmic.

Overall time complexity is `O(n^2 * m log m)`, which should be efficient enough given the constraints.
