[Leetcode 1928. Minimum Cost to Reach Destination in Time](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1928)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [fromi, toi, wi]` represents a bidirectional road between cities `fromi` and `toi` with a travel time `wi`. You are also given an integer `maxTime` which is the maximum amount of travel time allowed to reach your destination city `n-1` from the starting city `0`. Each city has a given `passingFees` array where `passingFees[i]` is the cost to pass through city `i`. Your task is to find the minimum cost to reach city `n-1` within `maxTime`. If it is not possible to reach the destination within the given maximum travel time, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can there be multiple edges between any two cities?**
   - Yes, it is allowed in graph problems.
2. **Is it guaranteed that the source and destination will be different?**
   - Yes, typically in these problems `0` (source) and `n-1` (destination) are different.
3. **Do all values in passingFees and edges guaranteed to be positive integers?**
   - Yes, fees and travel times are generally positive integers.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a modified version of Dijkstra's algorithm because we need to find the minimum cost under a constraint (maxTime). 

1. **Priority Queue:** Use a PriorityQueue to always extend the least-cost path first, which ensures "greedy" behavior typically used in Dijkstra's.
2. **Tracking Time:** Besides tracking cost, track the cumulative time taken to reach a city.
3. **Dynamic Programming:** Use a 2D DP array `dp[city][time]` where `dp[i][t]` represents the minimum cost to reach city `i` using time `t`.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step plan:
1. Initialize a priority queue and push the start position `(cost, time, city)` where the initial position is `(passingFees[0], 0, 0)`.
2. While the queue is not empty, pop the node with the smallest cost.
3. For each adjacent city, calculate the new cost and new time if we take this edge.
4. If the new time is within bounds and the calculated new cost is less than a previously recorded cost at that city-time pair, push the new state to the queue.
5. If we reach the destination city within maxTime, return the cost.
6. If the queue empties without reaching the destination, return `-1`.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MinimumCostToReachDestination {
    public int minCost(int maxTime, int[][] edges, int[] passingFees) {
        int n = passingFees.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n][maxTime + 1];
        for (int[] cost : dp) Arrays.fill(cost, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        dp[0][0] = passingFees[0];
        
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        pq.offer(new int[]{passingFees[0], 0, 0}); // {cost, time, city}
        
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            int[] current = pq.poll();
            int cost = current[0], time = current[1], city = current[2];
            
            if (city == n - 1) return cost; // Reached destination
            
            for (int[] edge : edges) {
                if (edge[0] == city || edge[1] == city) {
                    int nextCity = edge[0] == city ? edge[1] : edge[0];
                    int nextTime = time + edge[2];
                    int nextCost = cost + passingFees[nextCity];
                    
                    if (nextTime <= maxTime && nextCost < dp[nextCity][nextTime]) {
                        dp[nextCity][nextTime] = nextCost;
                        pq.offer(new int[]{nextCost, nextTime, nextCity});
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return -1; // Destination not reachable within maxTime
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumCostToReachDestination solver = new MinimumCostToReachDestination();
        int maxTime = 30;
        int[][] edges = {{0,1,10}, {1,2,10}, {0,2,15}};
        int[] passingFees = {5, 10, 20};
        System.out.println(solver.minCost(maxTime, edges, passingFees)); // Example output
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(T \times E \times \log N)\) where \(T\) is the maxTime, \(E\) is the number of edges, and \(N\) is the number of cities.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(T \times N)\) for the DP array and priority queue. The priority queue size also depends on the number of nodes pushed, which is influenced by maxTime and edges.

This solution efficiently finds the minimum cost route under time constraints using a combination of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm and dynamic programming.
