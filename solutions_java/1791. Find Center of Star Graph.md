[Leetcode 1791. Find Center of Star Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1791)
## Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 1791: "Find Center of Star Graph"

There is an undirected star graph consisting of `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`. A star graph is a graph where there is one center node and exactly `n - 1` edges that connect the center node with every other node.

You are given a 2D integer array `edges` where each `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]` indicates that there is an edge between the nodes `u_i` and `v_i`. 

Return the center of the given star graph.

**Example:**

Input:
```
edges = [[1,2],[2,3],[4,2]]
```
Output:
```
2
```


## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What is the minimum value for `n`?
   - **A:** The minimum value of `n` is 3 because a star graph has 1 center and at least 2 leaves.

2. **Q:** Can we assume the input edges are always going to form a valid star graph?
   - **A:** Yes, the input edges will always form a valid star graph as per the problem constraints.

3. **Q:** Will the input always have at least one edge?
   - **A:** Yes, since the minimum `n` is 3, there will always be at least `2` edges.

## Strategy

- A star graph has a unique center node, which is directly connected to all other nodes.
- For the given edge list, observe that the center node must be a part of every edge pairing.
- Thus, the center node must appear more frequently than any other node.
- However, in a star graph with `n` nodes, checking the first two edges is sufficient:
  - If the same node appears in both of these edges, it is the center node.
  - Otherwise, the common node between any two edges among the first few pairs is the center node.

## Code

Here's the Java solution to identify the center node of the star graph:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int findCenter(int[][] edges) {
        // Extract the first two edges
        int[] edge0 = edges[0];
        int[] edge1 = edges[1];

        // Check for the common node in the first two edges
        if (edge0[0] == edge1[0] || edge0[0] == edge1[1]) {
            return edge0[0];
        } else {
            return edge0[1];
        }
    }
}
```

## Explanation

1. Extract the first two edges `edges[0]` and `edges[1]`.
2. Check for the common node:
   - If `edge0[0]` matches with either `edge1[0]` or `edge1[1]`, this node is the center.
   - Otherwise, `edge0[1]` is the center since it would be the common node between first two pairs.

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is `O(1)` because we are only examining the first two edges to determine the center of the star graph. This constant time complexity is highly efficient for the problem constraints.
