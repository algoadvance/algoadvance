[Leetcode 1463. Cherry Pickup II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1463)
### Problem Statement

We are given a `rows x cols` grid representing a field of cherries where `grid[i][j]` is the number of cherries on the cell `(i, j)`. The grid has two robots that start at `(0, 0)` and `(0, cols-1)`. The goal is to move both robots to the bottom row of the grid and collect the maximum number of cherries. Both robots must move within the grid and can only move down, down-left, or down-right to the next row.

The robots start simultaneously from different positions, and at each step, they can collect cherries from the cells they move to. If both robots land on the same cell, only one will collect cherries from that cell.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the grid dimensions constraints?**
   - The grid will have dimensions such that `2 <= rows, cols <= 70`.

2. **What are the value constraints for cherries?**
   - Each cell in the grid can have `0` to `100` cherries.

3. **What happens if both robots land on the same cell?**
   - If both robots land on the same cell, they collect only one set of cherries from that cell.

4. **Do the robots need to start at the same time and move with the same speed?**
   - Yes, they start simultaneously and move row by row.

### Strategy

Use dynamic programming to solve this problem where states represent positions of both robots in each row. The dynamic programming array `dp[i][j1][j2]` represents the maximum cherries collected if one robot is at column `j1` and the other robot is at column `j2` in row `i`.

We will initialize a 3D DP array with dimensions [rows][cols][cols] and iterate row by row, considering all possible positions of both robots in the next row. For each cell `(i, j1, j2)`, we update the maximum cherries collected by considering all possible moves for both robots (down, down-left, down-right).

### Code

Here's the Java implementation of the solution:

```java
public class CherryPickupII {
    public int cherryPickup(int[][] grid) {
        int rows = grid.length;
        int cols = grid[0].length;

        // dp table
        int[][][] dp = new int[rows][cols][cols];

        // Initialize all dp values to a very small number representing -infinity.
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j1 = 0; j1 < cols; j1++) {
                for (int j2 = 0; j2 < cols; j2++) {
                    dp[i][j1][j2] = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
                }
            }
        }

        // Initial state
        dp[0][0][cols - 1] = grid[0][0] + grid[0][cols - 1];

        // Iterate over rows
        for (int i = 1; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j1 = 0; j1 < cols; j1++) {
                for (int j2 = 0; j2 < cols; j2++) {
                    // Iterate over all possible previous columns
                    for (int pj1 = j1 - 1; pj1 <= j1 + 1; pj1++) {
                        for (int pj2 = j2 - 1; pj2 <= j2 + 1; pj2++) {
                            if (pj1 >= 0 && pj1 < cols && pj2 >= 0 && pj2 < cols) {
                                int value = dp[i - 1][pj1][pj2];
                                if (j1 == j2) {
                                    value += grid[i][j1];
                                } else {
                                    value += grid[i][j1] + grid[i][j2];
                                }
                                dp[i][j1][j2] = Math.max(dp[i][j1][j2], value);
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        // Get the maximum cherries collected
        int maxCherries = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int j1 = 0; j1 < cols; j1++) {
            for (int j2 = 0; j2 < cols; j2++) {
                maxCherries = Math.max(maxCherries, dp[rows - 1][j1][j2]);
            }
        }

        return maxCherries;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CherryPickupII solution = new CherryPickupII();
        int[][] grid = {
            {3, 1, 1},
            {2, 5, 1},
            {1, 5, 5},
            {2, 1, 1}
        };
        System.out.println(solution.cherryPickup(grid)); // Output: 24
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(rows * cols^2 * 9)`. Here is the breakdown:

- `rows`: Number of rows in the grid.
- `cols^2`: For each row, we consider every pair of positions `(j1, j2)`.
- `9`: For each pair `(j1, j2)`, we look at 9 possible previous positions (since the robot can move to 3 possible columns and both robots must be considered). 

So, the total complexity is `O(rows * cols^2 * 9)`, which simplifies to `O(rows * cols^2)`, since 9 is a constant. This is efficient enough given the constraints (2 <= rows, cols <= 70).
