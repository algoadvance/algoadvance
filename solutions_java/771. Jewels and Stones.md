[Leetcode 771. Jewels and Stones](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l771)
### Problem Statement

You're given strings `jewels` representing the types of stones that are jewels, and `stones` representing the stones you have. Each character in `stones` is a type of stone you have. You want to know how many of the stones you have are also jewels.

Letters are case sensitive, so "a" is considered a different type of stone from "A".

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the `jewels` and `stones` strings be empty?**
   - Yes, they can be empty. In that case, the result would be 0.

2. **Can there be duplicate characters in the `jewels` string?**
   - No, each character in `jewels` is unique.

3. **Are there any constraints on the length of `jewels` and `stones`?**
   - Yes, the problem states that both strings will consist of only upper and lower case English letters and their lengths will be at most 50.

### Strategy

1. **Use a Hash Set for Jewels:**
   - Convert the `jewels` string into a `HashSet` for O(1) average-time complexity lookups.
   
2. **Iterate through Stones:**
   - For each character in the `stones` string, check if it exists in the `HashSet` of jewels.
   - Count how many times this check is true.

3. **Return the count:**
   - This count will represent the number of jewels present in the `stones` string.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashSet;

public class Solution {
    public int numJewelsInStones(String jewels, String stones) {
        // Create a HashSet from jewels characters
        HashSet<Character> jewelSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (char jewel : jewels.toCharArray()) {
            jewelSet.add(jewel);
        }
        
        // Count jewels in stones
        int count = 0;
        for (char stone : stones.toCharArray()) {
            if (jewelSet.contains(stone)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        
        // Test cases
        System.out.println(solution.numJewelsInStones("aA", "aAAbbbb")); // Output: 3
        System.out.println(solution.numJewelsInStones("z", "ZZ"));        // Output: 0
        System.out.println(solution.numJewelsInStones("", "ZZ"));         // Output: 0
        System.out.println(solution.numJewelsInStones("z", ""));          // Output: 0
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **HashSet Creation:** O(J), where J is the length of the `jewels` string.
- **Stones Iteration:** O(S), where S is the length of the `stones` string.
- **Total Time Complexity:** O(J + S).

### Space Complexity

- **HashSet Storage:** O(J), where J is the number of unique characters in the `jewels` string.
- The space complexity is primarily determined by the size of the `jewels` string, which means it will be O(J).

This solution efficiently calculates the number of jewels in the stones string using a HashSet for optimization.
