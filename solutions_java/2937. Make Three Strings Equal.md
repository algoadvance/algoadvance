[Leetcode 2937. Make Three Strings Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2937)
## Problem Statement

Given three binary strings `s`, `t`, and `u`, each of the same length, determine if it's possible to perform zero or more bitwise operations such as AND, OR, and XOR (each given as "&", "|", "^" respectively) on pairs of bits in the strings to make all three strings equal.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: s = "101", t = "010", u = "110"
Output: true
```

### Constraints:
- The lengths of the strings are equal.
- The strings are binary (consist of '0' and '1' only).

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the lengths of the strings fixed or can they vary?**
   - They are fixed, but all three strings will always have the same length.

2. **What operations are allowed?**
   - Bitwise AND (`&`), OR (`|`), and XOR (`^`) on pairs of bits in the strings.

3. **Can we perform these operations on any pair of bits, or do we need to do them in place within each string?**
   - We can perform these operations on any bit across the strings.

4. **Is there a limit to the number of operations we can perform?**
   - No, as long as it's possible to make all three strings equal, the number of operations is not limited.

## Strategy

To determine if we can make all three strings equal:
- We need to check the conditions resulting from each type of bitwise operation for each corresponding bit in the three strings.
- Consider each bit at position `i` in `s`, `t`, and `u`.
  - If all three bits are the same (`0` or `1`), they are already equal.
  - If two bits are `1` and one bit is `0`, then we need a combination of operations to turn the `0` into `1`. 
  - Conversely, if two bits are `0` and one bit is `1`, we would need to ensure the bit can be turned into `0`.

Conditions:
- For the bits to be equal, at least one of the bits must influence the rest.

## Code

Here's how we can implement this logic in Java:

```java
public class MakeThreeStringsEqual {
    public boolean makeStringsEqual(String s, String t, String u) {
        int n = s.length();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int count1 = 0;
            if (s.charAt(i) == '1') count1++;
            if (t.charAt(i) == '1') count1++;
            if (u.charAt(i) == '1') count1++;
            
            if (count1 == 1) {
                return false;  // It's impossible to make all three bits equal if two are 0 and one is 1.
            } // Otherwise (0 or 2 or 3 1s), it's always possible.
        }
        
        return true;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MakeThreeStringsEqual solution = new MakeThreeStringsEqual();
        
        String s = "101";
        String t = "010";
        String u = "110";
        
        System.out.println(solution.makeStringsEqual(s, t, u)); // Output: true
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where `n` is the length of the strings. Each bit position is checked exactly once in each string.

```plaintext
- We loop through each bit position in the strings exactly once.
- The operations within the loop (checking bit values and counting) take constant time.
Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n).
```
