[Leetcode 2276. Count Integers in Intervals](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2276)
## Problem Statement:
You are required to implement a data structure that can efficiently add intervals and count the number of unique integers covered by the added intervals. The data structure should support the following operations:

1. `add(int left, int right)`: Add all integers in the interval `[left, right)` to the data structure.
2. `count()`: Return the number of unique integers currently in the data structure.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Can intervals overlap?
   - Yes, intervals can overlap.
2. Is the interval [left, right) inclusive of `left` and exclusive of `right`?
   - Yes, the interval is inclusive of `left` and exclusive of `right`.
3. What is the range of integer values that can be added?
   - Typically, they are within a standard integer range.
4. How frequently are the add and count operations called?
   - To justify the need for an efficient approach, assume frequent add operations and occasional count operations.

## Strategy:
1. **Data Structure**: 
   - We will use a `TreeMap` to manage the intervals since it allows us to efficiently merge overlapping intervals and count the number of unique integers.
2. **Add Operation**:
   - For each new interval `[left, right)`, merge it with any existing overlapping intervals in the `TreeMap`.
   - Update the map by removing the old intervals and adding the new merged interval.
3. **Count Operation**:
   - Iterate through the `TreeMap` and calculate the total number of unique integers by summing the lengths of non-overlapping intervals.

## Implementation in Java:

```java
import java.util.TreeMap;

public class CountIntervals {
    private TreeMap<Integer, Integer> intervals;
    private int uniqueCount;

    public CountIntervals() {
        intervals = new TreeMap<>();
        uniqueCount = 0;
    }

    public void add(int left, int right) {
        if (left >= right) return;
        
        Integer start = intervals.floorKey(left);
        Integer end = intervals.ceilingKey(left);
        
        if (start != null && intervals.get(start) >= left) {
            left = start;
        }
        
        while (end != null && end <= right) {
            right = Math.max(right, intervals.get(end));
            uniqueCount -= intervals.get(end) - end;
            intervals.remove(end);
            end = intervals.higherKey(left);
        }
        
        intervals.put(left, right);
        uniqueCount += right - left;
    }

    public int count() {
        return uniqueCount;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CountIntervals ci = new CountIntervals();
        ci.add(1, 5);  // Adding interval [1, 5)
        ci.add(6, 10); // Adding interval [6, 10)
        System.out.println(ci.count()); // Expected Output: 8
        ci.add(4, 8);  // Adding interval [4, 8). Merges into [1, 10)
        System.out.println(ci.count()); // Expected Output: 9
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:
- **Add Operation**:
  - The `add(int left, int right)` operation primarily involves possible deletions and merges with existing intervals. Each insertion and removal operation in the `TreeMap` takes \(O(\log N)\), where \(N\) is the number of intervals. Thus, the overall complexity can be considered as \(O(M \log N)\) where \(M\) is the number of merges required.
- **Count Operation**:
  - The `count()` operation iterates through the intervals, leading to a time complexity of \(O(N)\) where \(N\) is the number of current intervals.

Thus, the `add` operation is efficient due to logarithmic operations, and `count` can be handled in linear time relative to the number of intervals.
