[Leetcode 811. Subdomain Visit Count](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l811)
### Problem Statement

A website domain "discuss.leetcode.com" consists of various subdomains. At the top level, we have "com", at the next level, we have "leetcode.com", and at the lowest level, "discuss.leetcode.com". When we visit a domain, we also visit the parent domains automatically.

For example, if we visit "discuss.leetcode.com", we will also visit "leetcode.com" and "com".

Now, you are given a list `cpdomains` of count-paired domains. Each element in `cpdomains` is a string that consists of a count and a domain. The task is to calculate the number of visits to each subdomain.

### Example:

Input: 
```plaintext
["9001 discuss.leetcode.com"]
```

Output:
```plaintext
["9001 discuss.leetcode.com", "9001 leetcode.com", "9001 com"]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the input size?**
   - The length of `cpdomains` will not exceed 100.
   - The length of each domain in `cpdomains` will not exceed 100.
   - The count in each domain entry will not exceed 10000.
   
2. **Can the subdomains overlap or be the same across multiple entries in `cpdomains`?**
   - Yes, subdomains can be the same across multiple entries, and their visit counts should be aggregated.

3. **What should be the format of the output?**
   - The output should be a list of strings, each formatted as "count domain".

### Strategy
1. **Initialize a HashMap:**
   - Use a HashMap to store the counts of each subdomain.
   
2. **Iterate through `cpdomains`:**
   - For each entry, split it into the count and the domain parts.
   - Split the domain by `.` to handle subdomains.
   
3. **Update Counts for Each Subdomain:**
   - Use the HashMap to accumulate the counts for each subdomain.
   
4. **Format the Result:**
   - Convert the HashMap entries back into the "count domain" format for the result.

### Code
```java
import java.util.*;

public class SubdomainVisitCount {
    public List<String> subdomainVisits(String[] cpdomains) {
        Map<String, Integer> domainCounts = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (String cpdomain : cpdomains) {
            String[] parts = cpdomain.split(" ");
            int count = Integer.parseInt(parts[0]);
            String domain = parts[1];
            
            String[] subdomains = domain.split("\\.");
            String currDomain = "";
            
            for (int i = subdomains.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
                currDomain = subdomains[i] + (currDomain.isEmpty() ? "" : "." + currDomain);
                domainCounts.put(currDomain, domainCounts.getOrDefault(currDomain, 0) + count);
            }
        }
        
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (Map.Entry<String, Integer> entry : domainCounts.entrySet()) {
            result.add(entry.getValue() + " " + entry.getKey());
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SubdomainVisitCount svc = new SubdomainVisitCount();
        String[] cpdomains = {"9001 discuss.leetcode.com"};
        System.out.println(svc.subdomainVisits(cpdomains));
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the total length of all domain strings in the input list `cpdomains`. This is because we iterate through each input once, and for each domain string, we process each of its subdomains.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N), for storing the counts of the subdomains in the HashMap and the resulting list.

This solution efficiently computes the visit counts for each subdomain and formats the results correctly.
