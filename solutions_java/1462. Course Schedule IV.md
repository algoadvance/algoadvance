[Leetcode 1462. Course Schedule IV](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1462)
# Problem Statement

The problem is based on a course prerequisite structure. You are given the total number of courses `numCourses`, labeled from `0` to `numCourses - 1` and a list of dependencies `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [a, b]` denotes that course `a` is dependent on course `b`. Additionally, you are given a list of queries `queries` where `queries[j] = [u, v]` and you need to determine if `u` is a prerequisite of `v`.

You need to return a list of boolean values where each entry in the list correspond to the query indicating if `u` is a prerequisite of `v`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can a course have multiple prerequisites?
2. Can a prerequisite have prerequisites of its own (i.e., a chain of prerequisites)?
3. Are there any constraints on the sizes of `numCourses`, `prerequisites`, and `queries`?
4. Should we handle invalid inputs like cycles in the prerequisites graph?
5. Can there be duplicate entries in the prerequisites?

Given that this is a standard problem, we can assume:
- The graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), meaning no cycles.
- Multiple prerequisites and a chain of prerequisites are allowed.
  
# Strategy

To determine if `u` is a prerequisite of `v`, we can use the following strategy:
1. **Graph Representation:** Represent the required courses as a directed graph.
2. **Transitive Closure:** Compute the transitive closure of the graph to determine reachability from each course.
   - The Floyd-Warshall algorithm can be used to compute the transitive closure efficiently for reachability queries.
3. **Query Processing:** Use the transitive closure matrix to answer each query in constant time.

# Code

Here is a possible Java implementation:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class CourseScheduleIV {
    public List<Boolean> checkIfPrerequisite(int numCourses, int[][] prerequisites, int[][] queries) {
        boolean[][] reachability = new boolean[numCourses][numCourses];
        
        // Populate the direct connections
        for (int[] prerequisite : prerequisites) {
            reachability[prerequisite[1]][prerequisite[0]] = true;
        }
        
        // Floyd-Warshall to compute the transitive closure
        for (int k = 0; k < numCourses; k++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < numCourses; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < numCourses; j++) {
                    reachability[i][j] = reachability[i][j] || (reachability[i][k] && reachability[k][j]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Answer the queries
        List<Boolean> results = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int[] query : queries) {
            results.add(reachability[query[0]][query[1]]);
        }
        
        return results;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CourseScheduleIV solver = new CourseScheduleIV();
        
        int numCourses = 4;
        int[][] prerequisites = { {2, 1}, {3, 2}, {1, 0} };
        int[][] queries = { {0, 1}, {1, 3}, {0, 3} };

        List<Boolean> result = solver.checkIfPrerequisite(numCourses, prerequisites, queries);
        System.out.println(result); // Expected output: [false, false, false]
    }
}
```

# Time Complexity

- **Graph Representation:** `O(P)` where `P` is the number of prerequisites.
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm:** `O(numCourses^3)` for computing the reachability.
- **Query Processing:** `O(Q)` where `Q` is the number of queries.

Overall time complexity is `O(numCourses^3 + Q + P)`.
