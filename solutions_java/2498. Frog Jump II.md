[Leetcode 2498. Frog Jump II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2498)
## Problem Statement
We are given an array `stones` where `stones[i]` represents the position of the ith stone in a river. A frog is trying to cross the river starting from the first stone and reaching the last stone. The frog can jump forward to any stone, but it cannot jump backward. Also, the frog can only jump to stones that are strictly ahead of it.

We need to find the minimum possible "maximum jump" the frog has to take to cross the river, defined as the maximum distance between consecutive stones in a chosen series of jumps from the first stone to the last stone.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the array `stones` sorted in increasing order?**
   - Yes, itâ€™s given that `stones[i]` represents the position in increasing order.
   
2. **Can the frog move from any stone to any other stone as long as the second stone is strictly ahead?**
   - Yes, the frog can only move forward and not backward.

## Strategy
The task is to find the minimum possible "maximum jump", which implies that the frog's largest jump should be minimized.

1. **Initialization**:
   - We will use a strategy involving binary search to determine the minimal possible "maximum jump".

2. **Binary Search**:
   - We'll apply binary search on the possible "maximum jump" values. 
   - The lower bound (`low`) will be the minimum distance between any two consecutive stones.
   - The upper bound (`high`) will be the maximum distance between any two consecutive stones.

3. **Feasibility Check**:
   - For a given "maximum jump" value, we'll ensure if it is possible for the frog to cross the river without any jump exceeding this value.
   - This can be checked using a greedy approach: always jump to the next stone within the allowed jump distance and count how many such jumps are needed.

## Code
```java
public class FrogJumpII {
    public int minMaxJump(int[] stones) {
        int n = stones.length;
        int low = 1, high = stones[n - 1] - stones[0];
        
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            if (canCross(stones, mid)) {
                high = mid;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return low;
    }

    private boolean canCross(int[] stones, int maxJump) {
        int currentPosition = stones[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < stones.length; i++) {
            if (stones[i] - currentPosition <= maxJump) {
                currentPosition = stones[i];
            } else {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FrogJumpII solver = new FrogJumpII();
        int[] stones = {0, 2, 5, 6, 7};
        System.out.println(solver.minMaxJump(stones)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Binary Search**: The binary search runs in `O(log M)` where `M` is the difference between the largest and smallest stone.
- **Feasibility Check**: The feasibility check for each midpoint runs in `O(N)` where `N` is the number of stones.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(N log M)`.

This strategy ensures that we efficiently find the minimum possible maximum jump the frog needs to make to cross the river by leverging binary search combined with a greedy feasibility check.
