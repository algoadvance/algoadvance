[Leetcode 2224. Minimum Number of Operations to Convert Time](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2224)
## Problem Statement

You are given two strings `current` and `correct` representing two 24-hour times. The string `current` represents the current time and the string `correct` represents the time we want to achieve. Each string is in the format "HH:MM", where `HH` represents the hours and `MM` represents the minutes. 

You can perform two types of operations:
- Add 1 hour to the current time.
- Add 1 minute to the current time.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to convert `current` to `correct`.

**Example:**
```
Input: current = "02:30", correct = "04:35"
Output: 3

Input: current = "11:00", correct = "11:01"
Output: 1
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. How should we handle cases where the `current` time is already equal to the `correct` time?
    - We should return `0` because no operations are needed.

2. Are there constraints on the input times? 
    - Yes, both `current` and `correct` are valid time strings in the "HH:MM" format.

3. Do we need to account for times that roll over after 24 hours?
    - No, both times are within the same 24-hour period.

## Strategy

1. **Parse the Time Strings:** Extract the hours and minutes from both `current` and `correct`.

2. **Convert to Minutes:** Convert both times to total minutes from the start of the day to simplify the calculation of the difference.

3. **Calculate the Difference:** Compute the difference in minutes between `current` and `correct`.

4. **Calculate Operations:**
    - Use the largest unit (hour) first to minimize operations.
    - Subtract as many hours (`60` minutes each) as possible.
    - Subtract as many `15` minute blocks as possible.
    - Subtract as many `5` minute blocks as possible.
    - Subtract the remaining minutes.

## Code

```java
public class MinimumOperationsToConvertTime {
    public int convertTime(String current, String correct) {
        String[] currentParts = current.split(":");
        String[] correctParts = correct.split(":");
        
        int currentHours = Integer.parseInt(currentParts[0]);
        int currentMinutes = Integer.parseInt(currentParts[1]);
        
        int correctHours = Integer.parseInt(correctParts[0]);
        int correctMinutes = Integer.parseInt(correctParts[1]);
        
        int currentTotalMinutes = currentHours * 60 + currentMinutes;
        int correctTotalMinutes = correctHours * 60 + correctMinutes;
        
        int difference = correctTotalMinutes - currentTotalMinutes;
        int operations = 0;
        
        if (difference >= 60) {
            operations += difference / 60;
            difference %= 60;
        }
        
        if (difference >= 15) {
            operations += difference / 15;
            difference %= 15;
        }
        
        if (difference >= 5) {
            operations += difference / 5;
            difference %= 5;
        }
        
        operations += difference; // Remaining minutes
        
        return operations;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumOperationsToConvertTime solution = new MinimumOperationsToConvertTime();
        System.out.println(solution.convertTime("02:30", "04:35")); // Output: 3
        System.out.println(solution.convertTime("11:00", "11:01")); // Output: 1
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(1) because the calculations consist of a fixed number of operations (parsing and arithmetic) irrespective of the input size.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) since no additional data structures or significant memory allocation is required. Only a few variables are used to store intermediate values.
