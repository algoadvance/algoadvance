[Leetcode 871. Minimum Number of Refueling Stops full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l871)
### Problem Statement

You are given a car with an initial amount of `startFuel`, which represents the total miles that the car can travel on a full tank of fuel. There are also `n` different gas stations positioned along a travel route. These gas stations are represented as an array `stations` where each `stations[i] = [position_i, fuel_i]` indicates that there is a gas station at `position_i` miles with `fuel_i` gallons of fuel available.

Your goal is to reach a destination that is located `target` miles away from the starting point. The car will stop at gas stations along the way to refuel as needed. 

Return the **minimum number of refueling stops** required to reach the destination. If it is not possible to reach the destination, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the stations array be unsorted?**
   - No, the stations array is sorted by their positions in ascending order.

2. **Is it guaranteed that startFuel is always enough to reach the first gas station?**
   - No, it is not guaranteed. We need to account for cases where the start fuel is insufficient to even reach the first gas station.

3. **What is the nature of the fuel at each station? Can it be zero?**
   - Yes, the fuel at each station can be zero, though typically it will not be.

4. **What range of values can `target`, `startFuel`, and the values in `stations` array take?**
   - All values are non-negative integers.

### Strategy and Code
The strategy involves using a **Max-Heap (Priority Queue)** to make sure we always refuel with the maximum available fuel at each step in order to minimize the number of stops. 

### Code
Here is the code in Java:

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class Solution {
    public int minRefuelStops(int target, int startFuel, int[][] stations) {
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b - a);
        int fuel = startFuel;
        int stops = 0;
        int i = 0;
        
        while (fuel < target) {
            // Add all reachable stations' fuel to the maxHeap
            while (i < stations.length && stations[i][0] <= fuel) {
                maxHeap.offer(stations[i][1]);
                i++;
            }
            
            // If no more stations are reachable and we haven't reached the target
            if (maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
                return -1;
            }
            
            // Refuel at the station with the max fuel
            fuel += maxHeap.poll();
            stops++;
        }
        
        return stops;
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Max-Heap Creation:** We use a max-heap to track the fuel of the stations we have passed but not yet used for refueling.
2. **Travel Loop:** We iterate through the stations and add the fuel of each reachable station to the max-heap.
3. **Refuel Decision:** If we can't reach the target with the current fuel and the heap is empty, return `-1`. Otherwise, refuel with the largest fuel available from our heap.
4. **Continuation:** Continue this until we reach or surpass the target distance.

### Time Complexity
- **O(n log n)** for building the heap and processing the fuel stations.
- **O(n)** to iterate over all stations.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)**, given that each insertion and deletion operation in the heap takes **O(log n)** time.
