[Leetcode 2180. Count Integers With Even Digit Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2180)
### Problem Statement
Given a positive integer `num`, return the number of positive integers less than or equal to `num` whose digit sums are even.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What are the constraints on the value of `num`?
   - **A:** `num` is a positive integer, typically within the range of `1` to `10^5`.
   
2. **Q:** Do we consider `0` as an even digit sum?
   - **A:** Yes, since `0` is even.

3. **Q:** Should negative numbers or non-integer inputs be considered?
   - **A:** No, the input `num` will always be a positive integer as per the problem statement.

### Strategy
1. **Convert Integer to Digits**: For each integer `i` from `1` to `num`, compute the sum of its digits.
2. **Check if Even**: Check if the digit sum is even.
3. **Count the Valid Numbers**: Maintain a counter to keep track of how many numbers satisfy the condition of having an even digit sum.

The solution involves iterating through all numbers from `1` to `num` and calculating the digit sum. This approach can be optimized further, but for simplicity, we'll start with a direct implementation.

### Code Implementation
```java
public class Solution {
    public int countEven(int num) {
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
            if (isEvenDigitSum(i)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
    
    private boolean isEvenDigitSum(int n) {
        int sum = 0;
        
        while (n > 0) {
            sum += n % 10;
            n /= 10;
        }
        
        return sum % 2 == 0;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.countEven(30)); // Example test case
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Iterating through the Numbers**: We need to consider each number from `1` to `num`, which takes O(num) time.
- **Calculating Digit Sum**: For each number `i`, calculating the digit sum involves summing up its digits, which takes O(d) time, where `d` is the number of digits in `i`. In the worst case, the number of digits can be approximately `log10(num)`. Hence, for each check, it takes around O(log num).

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(num * log num), because for every number from `1` to `num`, we are performing an operation that takes `O(log num)` time.

### Conclusion
The provided solution iterates through each number up to `num`, calculates the sum of the digits, and checks if the sum is even, counting the occurrences of such numbers. It's a straightforward approach with a clear time complexity of O(num * log num). This should be efficient enough for typical constraint limits as mentioned in the problem statement.
