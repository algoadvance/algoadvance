[Leetcode 2850. Minimum Moves to Spread Stones Over Grid full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2850)
### Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed `n x n` grid consisting of exactly `n` stones where `grid[i][j]` represents the number of stones at the cell `(i, j)`.

In one move, you can move one stone from a cell to an adjacent cell (cells are adjacent if they share a side).

Return the minimum number of moves required to place exactly one stone in each cell.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the maximum size of the grid (`n x n`)?**
   - This affects the complexity we can afford in our solution.

2. **Can there be cells with zero stones and cells with multiple stones initially?**
   - This clarifies the initial state we need to handle.

3. **Are diagonal moves allowed?**
   - The problem states adjacent cells share a side, so only vertical and horizontal moves are allowed.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - Since there are exactly `n` stones, we start with some cells having stones and others potentially empty.
   - Our goal is to ensure each cell has exactly one stone.

2. **Steps to Solve the Problem:**
   - Identify all cells with excess stones (more than one stone).
   - Identify all cells with a deficit (less than one stone).
   - Calculate the Manhattan distance (difference in rows plus difference in columns) between cells with stones and cells that need stones to minimize movement.
   - Use a heuristic or greedy approach to map excess stones to deficit slots in the shortest possible moves.

3. **Implementation Details:**
   - This involves two main arrays/lists: one for excess cells and another for deficit cells.
   - We'll iterate through each excess cell and calculate the minimum distance to any deficit cell, move one stone and mark that deficit cell as filled, and continue until all stones are balanced.

### Code Implementation

```java
public class MinimumMovesToSpreadStones {
    public int minMoves(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        List<int[]> excess = new ArrayList<>();
        List<int[]> deficit = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Step 1: Identify excess and deficit cells
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] > 1) {
                    excess.add(new int[]{i, j, grid[i][j] - 1});
                } else if (grid[i][j] == 0) {
                    deficit.add(new int[]{i, j});
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Step 2: Pair excess stones to deficit cells and count moves
        int moves = 0;
        for (int[] ex : excess) {
            int exRow = ex[0];
            int exCol = ex[1];
            int stones = ex[2];
            
            while (stones > 0 && !deficit.isEmpty()) {
                int[] df = deficit.remove(0);
                int dfRow = df[0];
                int dfCol = df[1];
                
                // Calculate the move distance and add to moves
                moves += Math.abs(exRow - dfRow) + Math.abs(exCol - dfCol);
                stones--;
            }
        }
        
        return moves;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Identifying Excess and Deficit Cells:** \(O(n^2)\) since we are iterating over the entire grid.
- **Calculating Moves:** The while loop ensures each excess stone is handled once, and each deficit cell is filled once effectively leading to a complexity of \(O(n)\) moves in the worst case.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n^2) + O(n) = O(n^2)\).

This approach should be efficient given reasonable constraints on \(n\). For very large \(n\), further optimization or heuristic methods may be required.
