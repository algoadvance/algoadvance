[Leetcode 1486. XOR Operation in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1486)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n` and an integer `start`.

Define an array `nums` where `nums[i] = start + 2 * i` (0-indexed) and `n == nums.length`.

Return the bitwise XOR of all elements of `nums`.

**Example:**
```
Input: n = 5, start = 0
Output: 8
Explanation: Array nums is equal to [0, 2, 4, 6, 8] where (0^2^4^6^8) = 8.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is `n` always a positive integer?**
   - Yes, assume `n` is always a positive integer.

2. **What are the constraints on `n` and `start`?**
   - Typically constraints in such problems range from small values up to the order of thousand or more. For this problem, we assume `1 <= n <= 1000` and `0 <= start <= 1000`.

3. **Can `n` be zero?**
   - The problem constraints likely guarantee `n` is at least 1 since arrays of size 0 wouldn't produce meaningful XOR results.

### Strategy

The strategy is straightforward:
1. Construct the array `nums` using the formula `nums[i] = start + 2 * i`.
2. Iterate through the array and compute the XOR of all elements.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int xorOperation(int n, int start) {
        int xor = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            xor ^= (start + 2 * i);
        }
        return xor;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.xorOperation(5, 0)); // Output: 8
        System.out.println(sol.xorOperation(4, 3)); // Output: 8
        System.out.println(sol.xorOperation(1, 7)); // Output: 7
        System.out.println(sol.xorOperation(10, 5)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, iterating through the array of size `n` once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, the space used is constant as we only use a single integer to store the XOR result. We don't store the `nums` array explicitly.
