[Leetcode 1010. Pairs of Songs With Total Durations Divisible by 60](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1010)
## Problem Statement

You are given a list of songs where the i-th song has a duration of time[i] seconds. Return the number of pairs of songs for which their total duration in seconds is divisible by 60.

### Example:
- **Input:** [30, 20, 150, 100, 40]
- **Output:** 3
- **Explanation:** 
  - 30 + 150 = 180 (divisible by 60)
  - 20 + 100 = 120 (divisible by 60)
  - 20 + 40 = 60 (divisible by 60)

### Constraints:
- `1 <= time.length <= 6 * 10^4`
- `1 <= time[i] <= 500`

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Will the input always contain at least two elements?
   - Yes, based on the constraints.
2. Are negative values allowed in the input list?
   - No, since the durations are always between `1` and `500`.
3. Should the pairs (i, j) and (j, i) be considered the same?
   - Yes, order does not matter since pairs (i, j) and (j, i) are the same.

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently:
1. Use a hashmap (or array) to keep track of the counts of remainders when durations are divided by 60.
2. For each song's duration:
    - Calculate the remainder `r` when the duration is divided by 60.
    - If the remainder is 0, then we look for previously seen durations with a remainder of 0.
    - Otherwise, look for previously seen durations with a remainder of `60 - r`.
    - Update the hashmap with the current remainder.
3. Sum up the pairs found using the hashmap counts.

## Code

Here's the implementation of the described strategy:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int numPairsDivisibleBy60(int[] time) {
        int[] remainderCounts = new int[60];
        int pairCount = 0;
        
        for (int t : time) {
            int remainder = t % 60;
            int complement = (60 - remainder) % 60;
            pairCount += remainderCounts[complement];
            remainderCounts[remainder]++;
        }
        
        return pairCount;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: We iterate over the list once to process each songâ€™s duration.

### Space Complexity:
- **O(1)**: The size of the `remainderCounts` array is fixed (60 elements), regardless of the input size.

This approach ensures we efficiently count the valid pairs with minimal space and in linear time relative to the input size.
