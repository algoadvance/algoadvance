[Leetcode 1926. Nearest Exit from Entrance in Maze](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1926)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` matrix `maze` (0-indexed) with empty cells (represented as '.') and walls (represented as '+'). You are also given the entrance position of the maze as an array `entrance` where `entrance = [entrance_x, entrance_y]` denotes the row and column of the entrance cell that you are initially standing at.

In one step, you can move one cell up, down, left, or right. You cannot step into a cell with a wall, and you cannot step outside the maze. Your goal is to find the nearest exit from the entrance. An exit is defined as an empty cell that is at the border of the maze and is not the entrance cell itself. Return the number of steps in the shortest path to the nearest exit, or -1 if no such path exists.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the entrance itself be considered an exit?**
   - No, the entrance cannot be considered as an exit.

2. **What if the entrance is on the border?**
   - The entrance is not considered an exit even if it's on the border. You have to look for other border cells.

3. **Can we modify the maze matrix?**
   - Yes, you can modify the maze matrix to mark visited cells to avoid revisiting.

### Strategy

We can solve the problem using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm because BFS is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid like this maze. We'll start from the entrance and explore all possible moves (up, down, left, right), stopping when we find the nearest exit.

Steps for BFS:
1. Initialize a queue and add the entrance cell to it along with an initial step count of 0.
2. Use a set or directly mark cells in the maze to track visited cells.
3. For each cell, check all 4 possible movements.
4. If a move leads to an unvisited cell within bounds and not a wall, and if itâ€™s a border cell but not the entrance, return the number of steps.
5. If not, mark the cell as visited and add it to the queue with the updated step count.
6. If the queue is exhausted without finding an exit, return -1.

### Code

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public class Solution {
    public int nearestExit(char[][] maze, int[] entrance) {
        int m = maze.length;
        int n = maze[0].length;
        int[][] directions = // use example from above
        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(new int[]{entrance[0], entrance[1], 0});  // {x, y, steps}
        maze[entrance[0]][entrance[1]] = '+';  // mark as visited

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] current = queue.poll();
            int x = current[0], y = current[1], steps = current[2];

            for (int[] direction : directions) {
                int newX = x + direction[0];
                int newY = y + direction[1];

                if (newX >= 0 && newX < m && newY >= 0 && newY < n && maze[newX][newY] == '.') {
                    if (isBorder(newX, newY, m, n) && !(newX == entrance[0] && newY == entrance[1])) {
                        return steps + 1;
                    }

                    maze[newX][newY] = '+';  // mark as visited
                    queue.offer(new int[]{newX, newY, steps + 1});
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }

    private boolean isBorder(int x, int y, int m, int n) {
        return x == 0 || x == m - 1 || y == 0 || y == n - 1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        char[][] maze = {
                {'+', '+', '.', '+'},
                {'.', '.', '.', '+'},
                {'+', '+', '+', '.'}
        };
        int[] entrance = {1, 2};
        System.out.println(solution.nearestExit(maze, entrance));  // Output: 1
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. In the worst case, we might visit every cell in the maze.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) due to the space required for the queue in the worst-case scenario where all cells need to be enqueued.
