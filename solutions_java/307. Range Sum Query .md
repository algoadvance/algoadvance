[Leetcode 307. Range Sum Query  full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l307)
## Problem Statement:

You are given an integer array `nums` and are required to implement a data structure that supports two operations: 

1. `update(int index, int val)` - Updates the value of `nums[index]` to `val`.
2. `sumRange(int left, int right)` - Returns the sum of the elements of `nums` between indices `left` and `right` inclusive (i.e. `nums[left] + nums[left + 1] + ... + nums[right]`).

The `nums` array is not immutable, meaning we need to handle multiple update and range sum queries efficiently.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **What is the size range of the `nums` array?**
   The size could be in a range of 0 to 30,000.

2. **What are the value ranges of the elements in `nums`?**
   Elements could be in the range of -10^4 to 10^4.

3. **How frequent are `update` and `sumRange` calls?**
   Both operations are frequent and need to be optimized.

4. **Could we have multiple updates before a sumRange query?**
   Yes, multiple updates can happen.

## Strategy:

Considering the requirement for multiple efficient updates and range sum queries, using a Binary Indexed Tree (also known as Fenwick Tree) will be an effective approach. This allows both update and sum operations in logarithmic time.

### Structure:
1. **Binary Indexed Tree (Fenwick Tree):**
   - Use an auxiliary array `BIT` which helps in achieving update and query operations in O(log n) time.

### Code:

```java
class NumArray {
    private int[] nums;
    private int[] BIT;
    private int len;

    public NumArray(int[] nums) {
        this.nums = nums;
        this.len = nums.length;
        this.BIT = new int[len + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            init(i, nums[i]);
        }
    }

    private void init(int index, int val) {
        index += 1;
        while (index <= len) {
            BIT[index] += val;
            index += index & -index;
        }
    }

    public void update(int index, int val) {
        int delta = val - nums[index];
        nums[index] = val;
        init(index, delta);
    }

    private int getSum(int index) {
        int sum = 0;
        index += 1;
        while (index > 0) {
            sum += BIT[index];
            index -= index & -index;
        }
        return sum;
    }

    public int sumRange(int left, int right) {
        return getSum(right) - getSum(left - 1);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- Initialization: O(n log n), where `n` is the length of `nums`.
- Update: O(log n) for each `update` operation.
- SumRange: O(log n) for each `sumRange` operation.

This solution provides an efficient way to handle dynamic updates and range sum queries which are frequent in this context.
