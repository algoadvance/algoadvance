[Leetcode 1457. Pseudo](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1457)
## Problem Statement
Given a binary tree where node values are digits from 1 to 9. A path in the binary tree is said to be pseudo-palindromic if at most one digit has an odd frequency along the path from the root to a leaf. You need to return the number of pseudo-palindromic paths from the root node to leaf nodes.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Is the number of nodes in the binary tree bounded by any limit?
   - Are all node values guaranteed to be between 1 and 9?

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Should the output be merely the count of pseudo-palindromic paths?

3. **Tree Properties**:
   - Can the tree be unbalanced?

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we can perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal on the binary tree. During the traversal, we will keep a frequency count of digit values along the path using a counter array. At each leaf node, we check if the path represented by the frequency count can form a pseudo-palindromic sequence. A sequence is pseudo-palindromic if at most one digit has an odd frequency.

### Steps Involved:
1. Initialize a counter array of size 10 (since node values are between 1 to 9).
2. Perform DFS traversal:
   - Update the frequency counter when descending a path.
   - Check the pseudo-palindromic condition at leaf nodes.
   - Backtrack (restore the counter) when moving back up the tree.
3. Count the number of valid pseudo-palindromic paths.

### Pseudo-palindromic Check:
- For a path to be pseudo-palindromic, at most one element in the frequency count array should have an odd count. 

## Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int pseudoPalindromicPaths(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        int[] count = new int[10]; // Since the node values are from 1 to 9
        return dfs(root, count);
    }
    
    private int dfs(TreeNode node, int[] count) {
        if (node == null) return 0;
        
        count[node.val]++;
        
        if (node.left == null && node.right == null) {
            if (isPseudoPalindromic(count)) {
                count[node.val]--;
                return 1;
            } else {
                count[node.val]--;
                return 0;
            }
        }
        
        int left = dfs(node.left, count);
        int right = dfs(node.right, count);
        
        count[node.val]--; // Backtracking
        
        return left + right;
    }
    
    private boolean isPseudoPalindromic(int[] count) {
        int oddCount = 0;
        for (int num : count) {
            if (num % 2 != 0) oddCount++;
        }
        return oddCount <= 1;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(H), where H is the height of the binary tree. In the worst case, the recursion stack will hold all the nodes along the path from root to a leaf, so the space complexity is proportional to the height of the tree.
