[Leetcode 3249. Count the Number of Good Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3249)
### Problem Statement

You are given the root of a binary tree. A node \( X \) in the tree is named **good** if in the path from the root to \( X \), there are no nodes with a value greater than \( X \).

Return the number of **good** nodes in the binary tree.

#### Example:
Consider the binary tree below:
```
        3
       / \
      1   4
     /   / \
    3   1   5
```

- The root node (3) is a good node because it is the only node in the path from the root to itself.
- The left child node (1) is not a good node because it has a parent node (3) with a greater value.
- The right child node (4) is a good node because in the path from the root (3 -> 4), all values are not greater than 4.
- One subtree of 4 has another good node (5) since in the path from the root (3 -> 4 -> 5) all values are not greater than 5.
- In the path from the root to the node with value 1 which is a child of 4, there is a value (4) greater than 1, thus it is not a good node.

The resulting count of good nodes should be 4.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Tree Properties**: Can nodes have the same value?
   - Yes, nodes can have the same value.
   
2. **Tree Size**: Are there any constraints on the number of nodes?
   - The number of nodes in the binary tree can be up to \(10^5\).

3. **Node Values**: Are there any constraints on node values?
   - Node values are within the range \([-10^4, 10^4]\).

4. **Tree Structure**: Can the tree be skewed?
   - Yes, the tree can be skewed (all nodes are either to one side).

### Strategy

We will utilize a Depth-First Search (DFS) traversal to solve this problem. 

1. **DFS Traversal**: We traverse the tree starting from the root node.
2. **Track Max Value**: Keep track of the maximum value encountered so far on the current path.
3. **Count Good Nodes**: For each node, if its value is at least equal to the maximum value so far, increment the count of good nodes.
4. **Update Max Value**: When moving to child nodes, update the maximum value to be the higher of the current node's value or the maximum value so far.
5. **Recursive Call**: Continue this process recursively for all child nodes.

### Code

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    
    private int countGoodNodes(TreeNode node, int maxVal) {
        if (node == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int goodNodesCount = 0;
        
        // Check if this node is a good node
        if (node.val >= maxVal) {
            goodNodesCount = 1;
            maxVal = node.val;  // Update the max value to the current node's value
        }
        
        // Recur for left and right subtrees
        goodNodesCount += countGoodNodes(node.left, maxVal);
        goodNodesCount += countGoodNodes(node.right, maxVal);
        
        return goodNodesCount;
    }
    
    public int goodNodes(TreeNode root) {
        return countGoodNodes(root, root.val);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \( O(N) \)
  - We need to visit each node exactly once in a DFS manner.
  
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(H) \)
  - This accounts for the recursion stack, where \( H \) is the height of the tree. For a completely unbalanced tree, the height \( H \) can be \( N \) in the worst case. In the average case for a balanced tree, \( H \) will be \( \log(N) \).
