[Leetcode 2081. Sum of k](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2081)
### Problem Statement

A k-mirror number is a number that reads the same both forwards and backwards (palindromic) in both base-10 and base-k. You are required to find the sum of the first `n` k-mirror numbers, given `k` and `n`.

For example, if `k` is 2 and `n` is 5, we need to find and sum the first 5 numbers that are palindromic in both base-10 and base-2.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the ranges for `n` and `k`?
   - Are `n` and `k` guaranteed to be positive integers?
    
2. **Output Specification:**
   - Do we return the sum directly as an integer?
    
3. **Example/Edge Cases:**
   - Could you provide a few examples of what `k-mirror` numbers are for better understanding?
    
Assuming the answers are:
1. `1 <= n <= 30` and `2 <= k <= 9`.
2. Yes, both are positive integers.
3. Yes, sum directly as an integer.

### Strategy
1. **Palindrome Check Functions:**
   - Create a function to check if a number is a palindrome in base-10.
   - Create a function to check if a number is a palindrome in base-k.
   
2. **Search and Summation:**
   - Iterate starting from the smallest number (1).
   - For each number, check if it is a palindrome in both base-10 and base-k.
   - If it is a k-mirror number, add it to the sum and increment the count.
   - Stop once we have found `n` k-mirror numbers.

### Code

```java
public class KMirrorNumber {
    
    // Function to check if a number is palindrome in any base
    public static boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
        int len = s.length();
        for(int i = 0; i < len / 2; i++) {
            if(s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(len - i - 1)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    // Convert number to base-k and return its string representation
    public static String convertToBaseK(int number, int baseK) {
        StringBuilder baseKRepresentation = new StringBuilder();
        while (number > 0) {
            baseKRepresentation.append(number % baseK);
            number /= baseK;
        }
        return baseKRepresentation.reverse().toString();
    }
    
    // Function to find the sum of first n k-mirror numbers
    public static long sumOfKMirrorNumbers(int k, int n) {
        long sum = 0;
        int count = 0;
        int num = 1;

        while (count < n) {
            if (isPalindrome(Integer.toString(num)) && isPalindrome(convertToBaseK(num, k))) {
                sum += num;
                count++;
            }
            num++;
        }
        
        return sum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int k = 2;
        int n = 5;
        System.out.println(sumOfKMirrorNumbers(k, n));  // Expected output based on problem context
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The approach involves checking each number sequentially:
- **Palindrome Check in Base-10:** O(log10(num))
- **Palindrome Check in Base-k:** O(logk(num))

Since we increment `num` and stop when we have found `n` k-mirror numbers, the worst-case complexity will depend largely on the density of k-mirror numbers. Although exact bounds are hard to predict, generally:
- **Total Time Complexity:** Roughly O(n * (log10(num) + logk(num))) where `num` is the number being checked. This depends on the number of checks needed to find the first `n` k-mirror numbers.

In practice, for n ≤ 30 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 9, this approach should be efficient enough for a typical coding interview setting.
