[Leetcode 2487. Remove Nodes From Linked List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2487)
### Problem Statement

You are given the `head` of a linked list. Remove every node that has a node with a greater value anywhere to the right side of it.

Return the modified linked list.

**Example**:
```
Input: head = [5, 2, 13, 3, 8]
Output: [13, 8]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: What should be done if there are multiple nodes with the same value and one is greater on the right?
   - **A**: All nodes should follow the rule. Hence, any node with a greater value on the right should be removed.

2. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the values of the linked list nodes?
   - **A**: No, there are no specific constraints mentioned regarding the node values other than they are integers.

3. **Q**: What is the maximum length of the linked list?
   - **A**: This is not explicitly stated, but it would be within typical coding interview constraints; assume reasonably large sizes that can fit in memory.

### Strategy

1. **Reverse the Linked List**:
   - By reversing the list, the problem is transformed into finding and keeping track of the maximum value encountered so far.
   
2. **Iterate and Filter**:
   - Iterate through the reversed list, and keep nodes only if they are greater than or equal to the maximum value encountered so far.

3. **Reverse Again**:
   - Finally, reverse the filtered list to restore the original order but with the required nodes removed.

This strategy ensures that we can handle the operation in linear time, which is optimal for linked lists.

### Code

```java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode() {}
    ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
    ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
}

public class Solution {
    public ListNode removeNodes(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null) return null;
        
        // Step 1: Reverse the linked list
        ListNode reversedHead = reverseList(head);
        
        // Step 2: Iterate and filter nodes
        ListNode maxNode = reversedHead;
        ListNode currentNode = reversedHead.next;
        ListNode prevNode = reversedHead;
        
        while (currentNode != null) {
            if (currentNode.val >= maxNode.val) {
                maxNode = currentNode;
                prevNode = currentNode;
            } else {
                prevNode.next = currentNode.next;
            }
            currentNode = currentNode.next;
        }
        
        // Step 3: Reverse the filtered list back to original order
        return reverseList(reversedHead);
    }
    
    private ListNode reverseList(ListNode head) {
        ListNode prev = null;
        ListNode current = head;
        
        while (current != null) {
            ListNode nextNode = current.next;
            current.next = prev;
            prev = current;
            current = nextNode;
        }
        return prev;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Reversing the list** takes O(n) time.
- **Filtering the nodes** takes O(n) time.
- **Reversing the list again** takes O(n) time.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.

This approach ensures we traverse the linked list a constant number of times, making it efficient and suitable for large inputs.
