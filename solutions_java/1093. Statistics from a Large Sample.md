[Leetcode 1093. Statistics from a Large Sample full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1093)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `count` where `count[i]` is the number of occurrences of the integer `i`, return the statistical information of the dataset represented by `count`, which includes the minimum, maximum, mean, median, and mode of the dataset. Answers within `10^-5` of the actual value will be accepted.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Data Range**: What is the range of the integers in the `count` array? 
   - The data range is typically stated in the problem statement. If not explicitly specified, assume a reasonable range or prompt the interviewer for clarification.
   
2. **Integer vs Non-Integer Calculations**: Are we returning the mean and median as floating-point numbers or as integers?
   - Mean and median are typically returned as floating-point numbers.

3. **Input Constraints**:
   - Are there any constraints on the size of the `count` array?
   - Any guarantees that the array will have at least one non-zero entry?

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - `minVal`: Track the minimum value.
   - `maxVal`: Track the maximum value.
   - `sum`: To calculate the mean.
   - `totalCount`: To calculate the mean and median.
   - `mode`: Track the value with the highest frequency.
   - `modeCount`: The count of the mode value.

2. **Iterate Once Over the `count` Array**:
   - Update `minVal` and `maxVal` by tracking the smallest and largest indices with a non-zero count.
   - Calculate `sum` and `totalCount` for the mean and median.
   - Find the mode by checking the maximum count.

3. **Calculate Mean**:
   - Mean = `sum / totalCount`.

4. **Calculate Median**:
   - Depending on whether `totalCount` is odd or even:
     - If `totalCount` is odd, find the middle element.
     - If `totalCount` is even, find the average of the two middle elements.
   
5. **Return Results**:
   - Return `[min, max, mean, median, mode]`.

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public double[] sampleStats(int[] count) {
        int minVal = -1, maxVal = -1, mode = -1;
        double sum = 0;
        int totalCount = 0;
        int modeCount = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < count.length; i++) {
            if (count[i] > 0) {
                if (minVal == -1) {
                    minVal = i;
                }
                maxVal = i;
                sum += (long) i * count[i];
                totalCount += count[i];
                if (count[i] > modeCount) {
                    modeCount = count[i];
                    mode = i;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Calculate mean
        double mean = sum / totalCount;
        
        // Calculate median
        double median = 0;
        int currentCount = 0;
        
        if (totalCount % 2 == 1) {
            // Odd number of elements
            int medianIndex = totalCount / 2;
            for (int i = 0; i < count.length; i++) {
                currentCount += count[i];
                if (currentCount > medianIndex) {
                    median = i;
                    break;
                }
            }
        } else {
            // Even number of elements
            int medianIndex1 = totalCount / 2 - 1;
            int medianIndex2 = totalCount / 2;
            for (int i = 0; i < count.length; i++) {
                currentCount += count[i];
                if (currentCount > medianIndex1 && median == 0) {
                    median += i;
                }
                if (currentCount > medianIndex2) {
                    median += i;
                    median /= 2.0;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return new double[] {minVal, maxVal, mean, median, mode};
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the length of the `count` array. We iterate over the array once to calculate all necessary statistics.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we use a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This solution efficiently computes the required statistics in a single pass over the `count` array.
