[Leetcode 3261. Count Substrings That Satisfy K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3261)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, count the number of substrings where the number of distinct characters is at most `k`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input constraints:**
    - What are the constraints on the length of `s`? Typical constraints range from `1` to `10^5`.
    - What is the range of `k`? Usually, `1 <= k <= 26` if we are dealing with lowercase English letters.

2. **Character type:**
    - Are we dealing only with lowercase English letters in the string `s`? If not, what are the possible characters?

3. **Output specifics:**
    - Should the function handle edge cases such as an empty string?
    - What should be returned if `k` is greater than the number of distinct characters in the string?

Without additional constraints specified, I'll assume we are dealing with a non-empty string of lowercase English letters and `1 <= k <= 26`.

## Assumptions
1. The input string `s` consists of lowercase English letters.
2. `1 <= k <= 26`.
3. The length of the string `s` is at most `10^5`.

## Strategy

We can use a sliding window approach combined with a hash map to efficiently count the number of substrings that meet the given constraint:

1. **Initialize variables**:
    - Use a hash map to keep track of the frequency of characters in the current window.
    - Maintain two pointers (`left` and `right`) to represent the current window.
    - A counter to keep track of the number of substrings that satisfy the condition.

2. **Expand the window**:
    - Move the `right` pointer to grow the window until the number of distinct characters exceeds `k`.
    - For each new addition, update the hash map.

3. **Shrink the window**:
    - Once the number of distinct characters exceeds `k`, move the `left` pointer to reduce the window size until the number of distinct characters is at most `k`.

4. **Count valid substrings**:
    - For each position of the `left` pointer, the number of valid substrings ending at position `right` is (`right - left + 1`).

## Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class SubstringKConstraint {
    public static int countSubstringsWithKConstraint(String s, int k) {
        if (s == null || s.length() == 0 || k <= 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        Map<Character, Integer> freqMap = new HashMap<>();
        int left = 0, right = 0, count = 0, distinctCount = 0;

        while (right < s.length()) {
            char currentChar = s.charAt(right);
            freqMap.put(currentChar, freqMap.getOrDefault(currentChar, 0) + 1);
            if (freqMap.get(currentChar) == 1) {  // A new character is added to the window
                distinctCount++;
            }
            
            // Shrink the window from the left if the distinct character count > k
            while (distinctCount > k) {
                char leftChar = s.charAt(left);
                freqMap.put(leftChar, freqMap.get(leftChar) - 1);
                if (freqMap.get(leftChar) == 0) {
                    distinctCount--;
                }
                left++;
            }

            // All substrings from left to right have at most 'k' distinct characters
            count += right - left + 1;
            right++;
        }

        return count;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s1 = "abcba";
        int k1 = 2;
        System.out.println(countSubstringsWithKConstraint(s1, k1));  // Output: 7

        String s2 = "aab";
        int k2 = 1;
        System.out.println(countSubstringsWithKConstraint(s2, k2));  // Output: 4
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. Both pointers `left` and `right` traverse the string at most once. The operations involving the hash map are O(1) due to the limited alphabet size (26 letters for lowercase English letters).

The space complexity is O(k), as we are storing frequencies of at most k distinct characters in the hash map.
