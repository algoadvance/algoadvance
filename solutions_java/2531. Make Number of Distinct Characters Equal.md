[Leetcode 2531. Make Number of Distinct Characters Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2531)
## Problem Statement

You are given two 0-indexed strings `word1` and `word2`.

A move consists of choosing two indices `i` and `j` such that `word1[i]` is different from `word2[j]` and swapping `word1[i]` with `word2[j]`.

Return `true` if it is possible to get the number of distinct characters in `word1` and `word2` to be equal with any number of moves, or `false` otherwise.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum length of `word1` and `word2`?**
   - Given that they are strings, confirming their length might be important for performance. (Likely constrained reasonably for interview purposes.)

2. **Are the strings guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - This ensures we don’t need to handle empty string edge cases unless specified.

3. **Should character case be considered?**
   - Clarifying if 'A' and 'a' are distinct or if the strings are case-insensitive.

4. **Do we only consider English lowercase letters?**
   - Confirming the input character range can simplify counting and comparison logic.

## Strategy

1. **Initial Character Counting**: 
   - Count the number of distinct characters in both strings.
  
2. **Set Operations to Evaluate Possible Swaps**:
   - Use sets to easily check what characters are present in each string.
  
3. **Conditions for Equal Distinct Count**:
   - Using the ability of swapping, determine if it’s possible to balance the distinct character counts.

## Code

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class Solution {
    public boolean isPossibleToEqualChars(String word1, String word2) {
        Set<Character> set1 = new HashSet<>();
        Set<Character> set2 = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (char c : word1.toCharArray()) set1.add(c);
        for (char c : word2.toCharArray()) set2.add(c);
        
        int distinct1 = set1.size();
        int distinct2 = set2.size();
        
        if (distinct1 == distinct2) return true;
        
        // Checking if swapping letters between set1 and set2 could balance the characters
        for (char c1 : set1) {
            for (char c2 : set2) {
                if (c1 != c2) {
                    // Simulate swap
                    Set<Character> tempSet1 = new HashSet<>(set1);
                    Set<Character> tempSet2 = new HashSet<>(set2);
                    
                    tempSet1.remove(c1);
                    tempSet1.add(c2);
                    
                    tempSet2.remove(c2);
                    tempSet2.add(c1);
                    
                    // Check if after swapping the number of distinct characters are equal
                    if (tempSet1.size() == tempSet2.size()) {
                        return true;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.isPossibleToEqualChars("abc", "bcd")); // False
        System.out.println(solution.isPossibleToEqualChars("aab", "bcc")); // True
        System.out.println(solution.isPossibleToEqualChars("a", "aa")); // True
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Initial Counting**: 
   - O(n + m) where n and m are lengths of `word1` and `word2` respectively.

2. **Checking Swap Scenarios**:
   - O(d1 * d2) where d1 and d2 are counts of distinct characters in `word1` and `word2`.

The worst case occurs when both strings have a high number of distinct characters, approaching O(n*m). However, given constraints typical in coding interviews, this approach should be adequate for evaluation.
