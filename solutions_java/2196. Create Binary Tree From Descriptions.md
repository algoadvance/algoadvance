[Leetcode 2196. Create Binary Tree From Descriptions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2196)
### Problem Statement
You are given a 2D integer array `descriptions` where `descriptions[i] = [parent_i, child_i, isLeft_i]` indicates that `parent_i` is the parent of `child_i` in a binary tree of unique values. Furthermore,
- If `isLeft_i` == 1, then `child_i` is the left child of `parent_i`, 
- Otherwise, it is the right child.

Construct the binary tree and return the root node of the tree.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Will the input always form a valid binary tree without cycles?
   - Yes, it is guaranteed that the input forms a valid binary tree.
2. Can the input `descriptions` be empty?
   - No, the input `descriptions` will always contain at least one description.

### Strategy
1. **Parse Descriptions**:
   - Use a `HashMap` to store each node value and create `TreeNode` objects for them.
   - Use a `HashSet` to keep track of child nodes to identify the root later.

2. **Build the Tree**:
   - Iterate through the descriptions:
     - For each description `[parent_i, child_i, isLeft_i]`:
       - If `parent_i` or `child_i` is not in the map, create a new `TreeNode` and add it to the map.
       - Set the left or right child based on the value of `isLeft_i`.
       - Add `child_i` to the `HashSet` of children.

3. **Identify Root**:
   - The root will be the only node that is never a child. This can be found by iterating through the nodes and checking against our `HashSet` of children.

4. **Return the Root Node**:
   - Return the identified root node.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.HashSet;

class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;

    TreeNode() {}
    
    TreeNode(int val) { 
        this.val = val; 
    }
    
    TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}
  
class Solution {
    public TreeNode createBinaryTree(int[][] descriptions) {
        HashMap<Integer, TreeNode> nodeMap = new HashMap<>();
        HashSet<Integer> childrenSet = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (int[] description : descriptions) {
            int parentVal = description[0];
            int childVal = description[1];
            boolean isLeft = description[2] == 1;
            
            nodeMap.putIfAbsent(parentVal, new TreeNode(parentVal));
            nodeMap.putIfAbsent(childVal, new TreeNode(childVal));
            
            TreeNode parentNode = nodeMap.get(parentVal);
            TreeNode childNode = nodeMap.get(childVal);
            
            if (isLeft) {
                parentNode.left = childNode;
            } else {
                parentNode.right = childNode;
            }
            
            childrenSet.add(childVal);
        }
        
        for (int key : nodeMap.keySet()) {
            if (!childrenSet.contains(key)) {
                return nodeMap.get(key);
            }
        }
        
        return null; // This line will never be reached if input is valid.
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - Building the tree involves iterating through the `descriptions` array once, which takes O(n) time.
  - Identifying the root involves iterating through the keys of the `nodeMap`, which also takes O(n) time.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - Storing nodes in the `nodeMap` and children in the `childrenSet` both require O(n) space.
