[Leetcode 1722. Minimize Hamming Distance After Swap Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1722)
## Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays, `source` and `target`, both of length `n`. You are also given an array of integer pairs, `allowedSwaps`, where `allowedSwaps[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that you are allowed to swap the elements at indices `a_i` and `b_i` of array `source`. 

The Hamming distance between two arrays of the same length is the number of positions where the elements are different.

Find the minimum Hamming distance between `source` and `target` after performing any number of swap operations on array `source`.

Example:
``` 
Input: 
source = [1,2,3,4], 
target = [2,1,4,5], 
allowedSwaps = [[0,1],[2,3]]

Output: 1
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of input values**:
   - What are the constraints on the size of the arrays and values within them?
   - Array length: \(1 \leq n \leq 10^5\)
   - Element values: \(1 \leq \text{values} \leq 10^5\)
   
2. **Nature of swaps**:
   - Can swaps be performed multiple times between any elements?
   - Yes, any number of swaps (including repeat swaps) can be done as long as they are in `allowedSwaps`.

3. **Assumptions**:
   - Both arrays `source` and `target` always have the same length.
   - The `allowedSwaps` list can be empty, in which case no swaps can be performed.

## Strategy

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Model the swapping process as a graph where each index of the array is a node and each allowed swap is an edge connecting two nodes.
   - Connected components in this graph represent indices that can be swapped among themselves.

2. **Group Swaps**:
   - For each connected component, group elements from `source` and from the corresponding indices in `target`.
   - Use these groups to determine the minimum Hamming distance by matching frequencies of elements within the group.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Use Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU) to efficiently find and union nodes in the graph.

## Code

``` java
import java.util.*;

public class MinimizeHammingDistance {
    
    public int minHammingDistance(int[] source, int[] target, int[][] allowedSwaps) {
        int n = source.length;
        DSU dsu = new DSU(n);
        
        for (int[] swap : allowedSwaps) {
            dsu.union(swap[0], swap[1]);
        }
        
        // Map each component to their indices
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> components = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int parent = dsu.find(i);
            components.computeIfAbsent(parent, k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(i);
        }

        int minHammingDistance = 0;

        // For each component, calculate the potential Hamming distance
        for (List<Integer> component : components.values()) {
            Map<Integer, Integer> sourceCount = new HashMap<>();
            Map<Integer, Integer> targetCount = new HashMap<>();
            
            // Count the freq of each value in current component in both source and target
            for (int index : component) {
                sourceCount.put(source[index], sourceCount.getOrDefault(source[index], 0) + 1);
                targetCount.put(target[index], targetCount.getOrDefault(target[index], 0) + 1);
            }
            
            // Calculate the contributed Hamming distance for current component
            for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : sourceCount.entrySet()) {
                int value = entry.getKey();
                int freqSource = entry.getValue();
                int freqTarget = targetCount.getOrDefault(value, 0);
                
                // Add the unmatched elements to the Hamming distance
                minHammingDistance += Math.max(0, freqSource - freqTarget);
            }
        }
        
        return minHammingDistance;
    }

    // Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) Class
    class DSU {
        private int[] parent;
        private int[] rank;

        public DSU(int size) {
            parent = new int[size];
            rank = new int[size];
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                parent[i] = i;
                rank[i] = 1;
            }
        }

        public int find(int x) {
            if (parent[x] != x) {
                parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
            }
            return parent[x];
        }

        public void union(int x, int y) {
            int rootX = find(x);
            int rootY = find(y);

            if (rootX != rootY) {
                if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]) {
                    parent[rootY] = rootX;
                } else if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]) {
                    parent[rootX] = rootY;
                } else {
                    parent[rootY] = rootX;
                    rank[rootX]++;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimizeHammingDistance solver = new MinimizeHammingDistance();
        int[] source = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        int[] target = {2, 1, 4, 5};
        int[][] allowedSwaps = {{0, 1}, {2, 3}};
        
        int minHammingDist = solver.minHammingDistance(source, target, allowedSwaps);
        System.out.println(minHammingDist);  // Output: 1
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Union-Find operations**:
  - Each `union` and `find` operation takes nearly constant time, approaching O(α(n)) — where α is the inverse Ackermann function.

- **Grouping and Frequency Count**:
  - Grouping elements will take \(O(n \log n)\) due to the use of hash maps for counting and the linear traversal of the array.

- Overall, the time complexity is **O(n log n)** due to the utilization of Union-Find with hash maps.
