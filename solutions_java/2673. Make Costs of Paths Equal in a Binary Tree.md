[Leetcode 2673. Make Costs of Paths Equal in a Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2673)
### Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, you are required to make the costs of all paths from the root to the leaf nodes equal. The cost of a path is the sum of the values of the nodes along the path. You are allowed to increment the values of the nodes. You need to return the minimum total increment required to make the costs of all paths equal.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: What are the constraints on the node values, if any (e.g., are they all positive, can they be negative or zero)?
   **A**: Node values can be any integer, positive, negative, or zero.
   
2. **Q**: What does a "path" signify in this problem?
   **A**: A path refers to any route starting from the root node down to a leaf node.

3. **Q**: Are the increments allowed to be fractional, or do they have to be integers?
   **A**: For simplicity, we will assume increments must be integers.

### Strategy
1. **Identify Leaf Nodes and Path Costs**:
    - Traverse the binary tree to find all leaf nodes and record the cost of the path to each leaf node.
    
2. **Determine the Maximum Path Cost**:
    - Compute the maximum cost among all paths, since this will be the target cost for every path.
    
3. **Calculate Required Increments**:
    - For each path, calculate the difference between the maximum path cost and the current path cost, and sum these differences to get the total minimum increment required.

4. **Implement Helper Functions**:
    - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to both identify paths and their costs and to find leaf nodes.

### Code
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 */
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode() {}
    TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
    TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

class Solution {
    public int minIncrementForEqualPaths(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        
        List<Integer> pathCosts = new ArrayList<>();
        calculatePathCosts(root, 0, pathCosts);
        
        int maxCost = 0;
        for (int cost : pathCosts) {
            maxCost = Math.max(maxCost, cost);
        }
        
        int totalIncrement = 0;
        for (int cost : pathCosts) {
            totalIncrement += (maxCost - cost);
        }
        
        return totalIncrement;
    }
    
    private void calculatePathCosts(TreeNode node, int currentCost, List<Integer> pathCosts) {
        if (node == null) return;
        
        currentCost += node.val;
        
        if (node.left == null && node.right == null) {
            pathCosts.add(currentCost);
        } else {
            if (node.left != null) {
                calculatePathCosts(node.left, currentCost, pathCosts);
            }
            if (node.right != null) {
                calculatePathCosts(node.right, currentCost, pathCosts);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Traversal and Path Cost Calculation**:
  - Each node is visited exactly once, making this operation O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
  
- **Finding Maximum Cost**:
  - This requires a single pass over the list of path costs, which is at most O(N) in size.
  
- **Calculating Total Increment**:
  - This also requires a single pass over the list of path costs, hence O(N).

Overall, the time complexity of the solution is **O(N)**, which ensures efficiency even for large binary trees.
