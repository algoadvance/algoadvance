[Leetcode 2840. Check if Strings Can be Made Equal With Operations II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2840)
### Problem Statement

Given two strings s1 and s2 of length n, check if you can make the strings equal by performing the following operations any number of times:

1. Swap any character at index `i` with any character at index `j` (where `i` is not equal to `j`).

You need to determine if it's possible to make both strings equal.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the lengths of both strings the same?**
   - Yes, the problem states that both strings have length `n`.

2. **Are there any constraints on the characters within the strings?**
   - The problem does not specify constraints, so we will assume typical constraints for string manipulation problems, such as characters being from 'a' to 'z'.

### Strategy

The fundamental insight here is that if we are allowed to swap any characters any number of times, the order of characters doesn't matter; only the frequency of each character does. Thus, if two strings can be made identical through any number of swaps, they must be anagrams of each other.

To check if two strings are anagrams:
1. **Frequency Count:** Count the frequency of each character in both strings.
2. **Comparison:** Compare these frequency counts; if they match, the strings are anagrams.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public boolean canBeEqual(String s1, String s2) {
        // Early exit: if the lengths are not the same, they cannot be made equal
        if (s1.length() != s2.length()) {
            return false;
        }

        // Initialize frequency maps
        HashMap<Character, Integer> map1 = new HashMap<>();
        HashMap<Character, Integer> map2 = new HashMap<>();

        // Build the frequency map for the first string
        for (char c : s1.toCharArray()) {
            map1.put(c, map1.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }

        // Build the frequency map for the second string
        for (char c : s2.toCharArray()) {
            map2.put(c, map2.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }

        // Compare the frequency maps
        return map1.equals(map2);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.canBeEqual("abc", "bca"));  // true
        System.out.println(sol.canBeEqual("aab", "bba"));  // false
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Frequency Count Construction:** 
   - Building the frequency map for both strings requires iterating over each character of the strings. This operation is `O(n)` for each string, where `n` is the length of the string.
   
2. **Map Comparison:**
   - Comparing two hash maps with `n` entries each (where `n` is the number of unique characters in the strings, which is at most 26 for lowercase English letters) is `O(1)` due to the fixed number of possible character counts.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.
