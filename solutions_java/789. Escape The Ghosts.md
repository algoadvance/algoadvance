[Leetcode 789. Escape The Ghosts](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l789)
### Problem Statement

You are playing a simplified PAC-MAN game. You start at the point `(0, 0)` and your destination is at point `(target[0], target[1])`. There are several ghosts on the map, and each ghost starts at some starting point `(ghosts[i][0], ghosts[i][1])`.

Each turn, you and all the ghosts simultaneously may move in one of the four cardinal directions: north, south, east, or west (moving from `(x, y)` to `(x + 1, y)`, `(x - 1, y)`, `(x, y + 1)`, or `(x, y - 1)`). You escape if and only if you can reach the target before any ghosts can capture you (i.e., land on you).

Given an array `ghosts`, where `ghosts[i]` is the starting position of the `i-th` ghost, and an array `target`, return `true` if it is possible to escape without being captured by any ghosts, otherwise return `false`.

Example 1:
```
Input: ghosts = [[1, 0], [0, 3]], target = [0, 1]
Output: true
Explanation: You can reach the destination (0, 1) right before the ghost at (1, 0) moves there.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: ghosts = [[1, 0]], target = [2, 0]
Output: false
Explanation: The ghost can reach the target at the same time as you.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can multiple ghosts occupy the same position?**
   * Yes, that can be assumed.
2. **What are the movement constraints?**
   * Both you and the ghosts can move to the four cardinal directions, and per turn, each can move exactly one unit.
3. **How do ghosts capture you?**
   * A ghost captures you by landing on the same cell as you.
4. **What if the player's starting point is the same as the target?**
   * You have already escaped since you reached the target. Return `true`.

### Strategy
1. **Distance Calculation**:
   * Use Manhattan distance to determine the number of steps required for both player and ghosts to reach the target.
2. **Escape Condition**:
   * You can escape if the distance for each ghost to the target is greater than the distance for you.

### Code
Here is the Java code implementing the strategy:

```java
public class EscapeTheGhosts {
    public boolean escapeGhosts(int[][] ghosts, int[] target) {
        int playerDistance = Math.abs(target[0]) + Math.abs(target[1]);

        // Check the distance of each ghost to the target
        for (int[] ghost : ghosts) {
            int ghostDistance = Math.abs(ghost[0] - target[0]) + Math.abs(ghost[1] - target[1]);
            if (ghostDistance <= playerDistance) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        EscapeTheGhosts solution = new EscapeTheGhosts();

        // Test case 1
        int[][] ghosts1 = // use example above
        int[] target1 = {0, 1};
        System.out.println(solution.escapeGhosts(ghosts1, target1)); // Output: true

        // Test case 2
        int[][] ghosts2 = // use example above
        int[] target2 = {2, 0};
        System.out.println(solution.escapeGhosts(ghosts2, target2)); // Output: false
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
* **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  * n is the number of ghosts in the input array. We iterate through the list of ghosts exactly once, computing the Manhattan distance for each ghost.
* **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  * We use a constant amount of space, regardless of the input size.

This solution efficiently checks for the escape condition by leveraging the properties of Manhattan distance and comparative speed to the target.
