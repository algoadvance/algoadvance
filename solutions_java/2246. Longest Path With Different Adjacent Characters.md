[Leetcode 2246. Longest Path With Different Adjacent Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2246)
### Problem Statement
You are given a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph with no cycles) rooted at node `0` consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. Each node has a unique character associated with it (represented by a character array `s` of length `n`).

Return the length of the longest path in the tree such that no pair of adjacent nodes on the path have the same character.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of `n`?
     - `2 <= n <= 10^5`
   - Are all characters in `s` lowercase English letters?
     - Yes
   - Is the tree guaranteed to be connected and acyclic?
     - Yes

2. **Output:**
   - Should the output be the longest path length itself or the longest path (the nodes involved)?
     - The length of the longest path.

### Strategy
1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Represent the tree using an adjacency list.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS):**
   - Perform a DFS to explore all possible paths in the tree.
   - Use two data structures: one for the maximum path including the current node and one for the maximum path excluding the current node.
   - Track the longest path length encountered during the DFS traversal.

3. **Backtracking with Conditions:**
   - For each node, ensure that the characters of adjacent nodes are different.

4. **Update and Combine Results:**
   - Update the maximum path lengths during the DFS traversal.
   - Calculate the longest path by combining the results from the child nodes.

### Code
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int longestPath(int[] parent, String s) {
        int n = parent.length;
        List<Integer>[] tree = new ArrayList[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            tree[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            tree[parent[i]].add(i);
        }

        int[] result = dfs(tree, s, 0);
        return result[1];
    }

    private int[] dfs(List<Integer>[] tree, String s, int node) {
        int maxPathFromNode = 1, maxLength = 1;
        for (int child : tree[node]) {
            int[] childResult = dfs(tree, s, child);
            if (s.charAt(child) != s.charAt(node)) {
                maxPathFromNode = Math.max(maxPathFromNode, 1 + childResult[0]);
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, maxPathFromNode + childResult[0] - 1);
            }
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, childResult[1]);
        }
        return new int[]{maxPathFromNode, maxLength};
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.longestPath(new int[]{-1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 2}, "abacbe")); // Example Output: 3
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The DFS approach ensures that each node is visited once.
- Building the adjacency list from the `parent` array takes O(n) time.
- Overall, the time complexity is O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes.

This solution effectively finds the longest path in a tree where adjacent nodes have different characters by using a DFS technique while maintaining a pair of maximum lengths based on the given constraints.
