[Leetcode 189. Rotate Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l189)
## Problem Statement
Given an array, rotate the array to the right by `k` steps, where `k` is non-negative.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Bounds on `k` and size of the array (`n`):**
   - What are the bounds on `n` (the length of the array) and `k`?
   - Is `k` always less than or equal to `n`?

2. **Array content:**
   - Can the array contain duplicate elements?
   - Are there any constraints on the type or range of elements within the array?

3. **Special cases:**
   - How should the function behave if the array is empty or contains only one element?
   
4. **In-place rotation:**
   - Should the rotation be done in-place, or can additional space be used?

## Strategy
1. **Normalize k:** Since rotating by `n` is equivalent to not rotating at all, we can use `k % n` to handle cases where `k` is greater than `n`.

2. **Reverse parts of the array:**
   - Reverse the entire array.
   - Reverse the first `k` elements.
   - Reverse the remaining `n - k` elements.

3. **Example:**
   - Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3`
   - Steps:
     1. Reverse entire array: `[7,6,5,4,3,2,1]`
     2. Reverse first 3 elements: `[5,6,7,4,3,2,1]`
     3. Reverse remaining 4 elements: `[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]`
   - Output: `[5,6,7,1,2,3,4]`

## Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        k = k % n; // Normalize k
        
        // Reverse entire array
        reverse(nums, 0, n - 1);
        
        // Reverse first k elements
        reverse(nums, 0, k - 1);
        
        // Reverse remaining n-k elements
        reverse(nums, k, n - 1);
    }
    
    private void reverse(int[] nums, int start, int end) {
        while (start < end) {
            int temp = nums[start];
            nums[start] = nums[end];
            nums[end] = temp;
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array. This comes from three passes over the array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) because the rotation is performed in-place without requiring additional space.

This solution efficiently rotates the array using the reversal method while maintaining an in-place operation and linear time complexity.
