[Leetcode 1314. Matrix Block Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1314)
Sure! Let's break down the solution for the problem "1314. Matrix Block Sum".

### Problem Statement
You are given a `m x n` matrix `mat` and an integer `K`, you need to return a matrix `answer` where each `answer[i][j]` is the sum of all elements `mat[r][c]` for:
i - K <= r <= i + K,
j - K <= c <= j + K,
and (r, c) is within the bounds of the matrix.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:** What are the size limits for `m` and `n`?
2. **Output Format:** Should the output matrix (`answer`) have the same dimensions as the input matrix (`mat`)?
3. **Edge Cases:** How should we handle edge cases such as when `K = 0` or when the matrix dimensions are minimal, e.g., 1x1?

### Strategy
1. **Prefix Sum Matrix:** We can utilize a prefix sum matrix to store the cumulative sum of sub-matrices. This allows for efficient computation of the sum for any sub-matrix in constant time.
2. **Sub-Matrix Sum Calculation:** Using the prefix sum matrix, we can efficiently calculate the sum of elements within the (i-K, j-K) to (i+K, j+K) range.
3. **Boundary Conditions:** Handle boundaries carefully to ensure we don't access indices out of the matrix bounds.

### Steps:
1. Create a prefix sum matrix `prefix`.
2. Iterate over the given input matrix to fill the prefix sum matrix.
3. Create the output matrix by using the prefix sum matrix to compute the required block sums for each element.

### Code
```java
public class MatrixBlockSum {
    public int[][] matrixBlockSum(int[][] mat, int K) {
        int m = mat.length;
        int n = mat[0].length;
        int[][] prefixSum = new int[m + 1][n + 1];
        
        // Build the prefix sum matrix
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                prefixSum[i][j] = mat[i - 1][j - 1] + prefixSum[i - 1][j] + prefixSum[i][j - 1] - prefixSum[i - 1][j - 1];
            }
        }
        
        int[][] result = new int[m][n];
        
        // Calculate the matrix block sum using the prefix sum matrix
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                // Determine the boundaries of the block
                int r1 = Math.max(0, i - K);
                int c1 = Math.max(0, j - K);
                int r2 = Math.min(m - 1, i + K);
                int c2 = Math.min(n - 1, j + K);
                
                // Using the prefix sum matrix to get the sum of the block
                result[i][j] = prefixSum[r2 + 1][c2 + 1] - prefixSum[r1][c2 + 1] - prefixSum[r2 + 1][c1] + prefixSum[r1][c1];
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Computing Prefix Sum Matrix:** O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in `mat`.
- **Calculating Block Sums:** O(m * n).
- **Total Time Complexity:** O(m * n), which is efficient for large matrices.

This solution provides an efficient way to compute the required matrix block sums using prefix sums, ensuring optimal performance even for large input sizes.
