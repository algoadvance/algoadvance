[Leetcode 2542. Maximum Subsequence Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2542)
## Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of equal length `n` and an integer `k`. The score of a subsequence `(i1, i2, ..., ik)` is defined as:

- `nums1[i1] + nums1[i2] + ... + nums1[ik]` + the minimum value among the elements at the chosen indices in `nums2`.

Return the maximum possible score of a subsequence with length `k`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of the integer values in `nums1` and `nums2`?
   - For the sake of this solution, we will assume standard integer ranges.

2. Can `k` be equal to `n`?
   - Yes, `k` can be equal to `n`.

3. Are the elements of the arrays distinct?
   - The problem statement does not specify, so we should assume that the elements are not necessarily distinct.

4. What's the expected time complexity to solve this problem considering the size constraints?
   - The problem doesn't specify time constraints, but given the standard interview questions, we should aim for at most \(O(n \log n)\).

## Strategy

1. Pair the elements of `nums1` and `nums2` as tuples along with their indices: `(nums1[i], nums2[i], i)`.
2. Sort these tuples primarily by `nums2` in descending order because the minimum value among the elements at the chosen indices in `nums2` will greatly influence the score.
3. Use a max-heap (priority queue) to keep track of the largest `k` values of `nums1` while iterating through the sorted tuples.
4. Continuously calculate the current potential score by summing the largest k values in `nums1` and adding the current minimum value in `nums2` from the sorted tuples.

## Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public class MaximumSubsequenceScore {
    public int maxScore(int[] nums1, int[] nums2, int k) {
        int n = nums1.length;
        // Pair and sort based on nums2 in descending order
        int[][] pairs = new int[n][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            pairs[i][0] = nums1[i];
            pairs[i][1] = nums2[i];
        }
        
        Arrays.sort(pairs, (a, b) -> b[1] - a[1]);
        
        // Priority queue (min-heap) to track the largest k elements in nums1
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(k);
        long currentSum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            pq.offer(pairs[i][0]);
            currentSum += pairs[i][0];
        }
        
        // Initialize max score with the first k elements' sum and min value of nums2
        long maxScore = currentSum + pairs[k - 1][1];
        
        // Loop through the rest elements
        for (int i = k; i < n; i++) {
            // Push current nums1 into the heap and pop the smallest if heap is full
            if (pairs[i][0] > pq.peek()) {
                currentSum += pairs[i][0] - pq.poll();
                pq.offer(pairs[i][0]);
            }
            // Calculate and update max score
            maxScore = Math.max(maxScore, currentSum + pairs[i][1]);
        }
        
        return (int) maxScore;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Sorting pairs**: \(O(n \log n)\).
2. **Heap operations (push and pop for k elements)**: \(O(k \log k)\) and this is done for each of the \(n-k\) remaining elements. So, total heap operations: \(O((n-k) \log k)\).

Hence, the overall time complexity is: \(O(n \log n)\).

This algorithm efficiently calculates the maximum subsequence score by leveraging sorting and a heap, ensuring optimal performance for large input sizes.
