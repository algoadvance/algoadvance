[Leetcode 1753. Maximum Score From Removing Stones](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1753)
## Problem Statement
You are given three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, representing the number of stones in three piles. In each move, you can take one stone from any two different piles and add a point to your score. Your goal is to maximize your score by making the maximum number of moves.

Return the maximum score you can get.

For example:
- Input: `a = 2`, `b = 4`, `c = 6`
- Output: `6`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the number of stones be zero in any pile initially?**
   - Yes, the number of stones in any pile can be zero initially.
2. **Should we assume the inputs are always non-negative integers?**
   - Yes, assume that `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers.
3. **Is there any constraint on the size of `a`, `b`, `c`?**
   - Yes, `0 <= a, b, c <= 10^5`.

## Strategy
The optimal strategy to maximize the score is to always pick the two largest piles and take one stone from each. This ensures you're depleting the piles with the largest number of stones first, maximizing the number of moves you can make.

Steps:
1. **Sort the three piles** `a`, `b`, `c` in descending order to always identify the two largest piles.
2. **Iteratively** remove one stone from each of the two largest piles until at least one of the piles is empty.
3. **Return the count** of moves made.

## Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int maximumScore(int a, int b, int c) {
        int[] piles = {a, b, c};
        int score = 0;
        
        while (true) {
            Arrays.sort(piles);
            
            // Always take from the two largest piles
            if (piles[1] == 0) {
                break; // If the second largest pile is empty, we cannot make more moves
            }
            
            // Take one stone from the two largest piles
            piles[1]--;
            piles[2]--;
            score++;
        }
        
        return score;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();

        // Test cases
        System.out.println(sol.maximumScore(2, 4, 6)); // Expected output: 6
        System.out.println(sol.maximumScore(4, 4, 4)); // Expected output: 6
        System.out.println(sol.maximumScore(1, 8, 8)); // Expected output: 8
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting Operation:** Sorting the piles array of size 3 is O(1) since it's a fixed small size.
- **Loop to Remove Stones:** In the worst case, the number of iterations is proportional to the sum of the number of stones in all piles, which is `O(a + b + c)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(a + b + c), but this is very efficient given the constraints `0 <= a, b, c <= 10^5`.
