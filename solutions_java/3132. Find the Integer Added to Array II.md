[Leetcode 3132. Find the Integer Added to Array II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3132)
### Problem Statement
Given an initial array `arr` of integers and its duplicate `arr2` with one additional integer added to it, find and return the additional integer.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What are the constraints on the elements in the array?
   **A:** The elements of the array can be any integers, including negatives.

2. **Q:** What is the range of the size of the arrays?
   **A:** Let's assume \(0 \leq \text{size of arr} \leq 10^5\).

3. **Q:** Can the additional integer be any value, or does it need to adhere to any specific constraints?
   **A:** The additional integer can be any integer.

4. **Q:** Are there any guarantees about the order of elements in the arrays?
   **A:** No guarantees about ordering, the arrays could be in any order.

### Strategy
To find the additional integer, we use the properties of sum:
- Sum all the elements of `arr` and `arr2`.
- Subtract the sum of `arr` from the sum of `arr2`.
- The result of this subtraction will be the additional integer.

This approach is efficient because it reduces the problem to a few arithmetic operations and has a linear time complexity.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the smaller array `arr`.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), since we are using a few additional variables for summation.

### Code
```java
public class FindAdditionalInteger {
    public int findAdditionalInteger(int[] arr, int[] arr2) {
        int sumArr = 0;
        int sumArr2 = 0;
        
        for (int num : arr) {
            sumArr += num;
        }
        
        for (int num : arr2) {
            sumArr2 += num;
        }
        
        return sumArr2 - sumArr;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FindAdditionalInteger solution = new FindAdditionalInteger();
        
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        int[] arr2 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        
        System.out.println("Additional Integer: " + solution.findAdditionalInteger(arr, arr2));
        // Expected Output: 5
    }
}
```

This code defines a method `findAdditionalInteger` that calculates the additional integer by summing the elements of both arrays and returning the difference in sums. It is demonstrated using a `main` method with an example.
