[Leetcode 2698. Find the Punishment Number of an Integer](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2698)
### Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer `n`. The punishment number of `n` is the sum of the squares of all integers `i` (where 1 ≤ i ≤ n) such that the decimal representation of `i^2` can be partitioned into one or more subsequences whose sum is equal to `i`.

Return the punishment number of `n`.

**Example:**
```
Input: n = 5
Output: 10
Explanation: 
1^2 = 1, 10^2 = 9 (1 can be partitioned into '1' -> sums to 1)
2^2 = 4, 2^2 (cannot be partitioned to sum to 2)
3^2 = 9, 3^2 (cannot be partitioned to sum to 3)
4^2 = 16, 16 (can be partitioned into '1', '6' -> sums to 1+6=7, not equal to 4)
5^2 = 25, 25 (can be partitioned into '2', '5' -> sums to 2+5=7, not equal to 5)
Total punishement number is 1^2 = 1.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can `n` be 0 or negative? => No, `n` is always a positive integer.
2. Would there be an upper limit on `n`? => Assume reasonable constraints like `n <= 1000` for practical purposes.
3. Do we need to handle leading zeros in the decimal representation? => No, treat the squared number as it appears.

### Strategy

1. We need to generate squares for each integer `i` from 1 to `n`.
2. Convert the square into a string and check if it can be partitioned into a sequence where the sum matches the integer `i`.
3. Implement a function that attempts all possible partitions of the number string to verify if any of them sum up to `i`.
4. Accumulate squares of all such valid `i`.

### Code

```java
public class PunishmentNumber {
    
    public int punishmentNumber(int n) {
        int punishmentSum = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            int square = i * i;
            if (canPartitionToSum(String.valueOf(square), i)) {
                punishmentSum += square;
            }
        }
        return punishmentSum;
    }
    
    private boolean canPartitionToSum(String numStr, int target) {
        return canPartitionToSumHelper(numStr, target, 0, 0);
    }
    
    private boolean canPartitionToSumHelper(String numStr, int target, int currentSum, int start) {
        if (start == numStr.length()) {
            return currentSum == target;
        }
        
        for (int end = start + 1; end <= numStr.length(); end++) {
            String part = numStr.substring(start, end);
            int partValue = Integer.parseInt(part);
            if (canPartitionToSumHelper(numStr, target, currentSum + partValue, end)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PunishmentNumber pn = new PunishmentNumber();
        System.out.println(pn.punishmentNumber(5));  // Output: 10
        System.out.println(pn.punishmentNumber(10)); // Output:
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution can be analyzed as follows:
- For each number from 1 to `n`, we compute the square, which is `O(n)`.
- For each square, we attempt to partition it in various ways. In the worst case, the number string length can go up to `log10(n^2)`, giving us `O((log(n))!)` possible partitions.

Overall:
- The outer loop runs `O(n)`.
- For each number, partitioning takes `O(2^k)` where `k` is the number of digits in the squared value.

In practical terms, this solution should be efficient for moderate values of `n` (such as <= 1000).
