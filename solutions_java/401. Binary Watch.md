[Leetcode 401. Binary Watch](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l401)
### Problem Statement
A binary watch has 4 LEDs on the top which represent the hours (0-11), and the 6 LEDs on the bottom represent the minutes (0-59). Each LED represents a zero or one, with the least significant bit on the right.

Given a non-negative integer `turnedOn` which represents the number of LEDs that are currently on, return all possible times the watch could represent. You may return the answer in any order.

The hour (0-11) and minute (0-59) should be represented as a digital clock time of "HH:MM".

### Example
```
Input: turnedOn = 1
Output: ["0:01","0:02","0:04","0:08","0:16","0:32","1:00","2:00","4:00","8:00"]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the input `turnedOn` always valid such that 0 <= `turnedOn` <= 10?**
   - Yes, `turnedOn` will always be within this range.
   
2. **Can we assume the returned list of times does not need to be sorted?**
   - Yes, the order of the output time strings does not matter.

### Strategy
1. **Bit Counting:** 
   - For each possible combination of hour and minute, count the number of LEDs that are turned on.
   - We need to ensure the total number of turned-on LEDs equals `turnedOn`.

2. **Valid Time Checking:**
   - We iterate from `0` to `11` for hours and from `0` to `59` for minutes.
   - Use bitwise operations to check how many bits are set (turned on) in these numbers.

3. **Format the Output:**
   - Ensure the hour is a single or double digit and minute is two digits.

### Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public List<String> readBinaryWatch(int turnedOn) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int h = 0; h < 12; h++) {
            for (int m = 0; m < 60; m++) {
                // Count the number of 1s in the binary representation of h and m
                if (Integer.bitCount(h) + Integer.bitCount(m) == turnedOn) {
                    result.add(String.format("%d:%02d", h, m));
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        List<String> times = solution.readBinaryWatch(1);
        for (String time : times) {
            System.out.println(time);
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Iterating Hours:** We iterate from `0` to `11` (12 iterations).
- **Iterating Minutes:** For each hour, we iterate from `0` to `59` (60 iterations).
- **Bit Count Check:** Checking the number of bits set is a constant time operation.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(12 * 60)**, which simplifies to **O(720)**. Since 720 operations are quite manageable, the solution is efficient.
