[Leetcode 290. Word Pattern](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l290)
### Problem Statement

You are given a pattern `s` and a string `str`. Determine if `str` follows the same pattern.

Here is the problem statement in more detail:

- `pattern` is a string containing only lowercase alphabetical characters.
- `str` is a string containing lowercase alphabetical words separated by spaces.
- Determine if `str` follows the same pattern where:

    - Each unique character in `pattern` corresponds to a unique word in `str`.
    - Each unique word in `str` must match a unique character in `pattern`.

### Example 

- Input: pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat dog"
  Output: true

- Input: pattern = "abba", str = "dog cat cat fish"
  Output: false

- Input: pattern = "aaaa", str = "dog cat cat dog"
  Output: false

- Input: pattern = "abba", str = "dog dog dog dog"
  Output: false

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `pattern` or `str` be empty?**
   - No, both `pattern` and `str` are non-empty.

2. **Are words in `str` separated by exactly one space?**
   - Yes, the words in `str` are separated by exactly one space.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use two hash maps (or dictionaries):

- One map for pattern-to-word.
- One map for word-to-pattern.

We will iterate through the pattern and the words in `str` simultaneously, checking if the current pattern character and current word adhere to the expected mapping. If we find a contradiction at any point, we return `false`.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public boolean wordPattern(String pattern, String s) {
        String[] words = s.split(" ");
        
        if (pattern.length() != words.length) {
            return false;
        }
        
        HashMap<Character, String> patternToWordMap = new HashMap<>();
        HashMap<String, Character> wordToPatternMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < pattern.length(); i++) {
            char c = pattern.charAt(i);
            String word = words[i];
            
            if (patternToWordMap.containsKey(c)) {
                // Check if the current character's mapped word matches the current word
                if (!patternToWordMap.get(c).equals(word)) {
                    return false;
                }
            } else {
                patternToWordMap.put(c, word);
            }
            
            if (wordToPatternMap.containsKey(word)) {
                // Check if the current word's mapped pattern character matches the current character
                if (wordToPatternMap.get(word) != c) {
                    return false;
                }
            } else {
                wordToPatternMap.put(word, c);
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Splitting the string `s`:** O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`.
- **Looping through the pattern:** O(m), where m is the length of the pattern.
- **HashMap operations (put/get):** O(1) on average.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n + m). Given that m is typically proportional to n (the words in `str`), the time complexity can be considered O(n).
