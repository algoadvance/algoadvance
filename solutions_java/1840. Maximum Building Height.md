[Leetcode 1840. Maximum Building Height](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1840)
### Problem Statement

**1840. Maximum Building Height**

You want to build `n` new buildings in a city. The new buildings will be built in a line and are labeled from `1` to `n`. However, there are city restrictions on the heights of the new buildings:
- The height of the building `1` is `0`.
- The height of the last building can be any non-negative integer.

Additionally, there are some restrictions on the heights for specific buildings, given as a 2D array `restrictions` where `restrictions[i] = [id_i, maxHeight_i]` indicates that building `id_i` must have a height less than or equal to `maxHeight_i`.

Return the maximum possible height of the tallest building.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Are the `restrictions` sorted by building id?
   **A**: No, they are not guaranteed to be sorted. You may need to sort them by building id first.

2. **Q**: What should be the height relationship between neighboring buildings?
   **A**: The height of any building cannot differ from the height of its immediate neighbors by more than 1.

3. **Q**: What is the range of `n` and the number of restrictions?
   **A**: The number of buildings, `n`, can be up to `10^9`, but the number of restrictions is much smaller, typically up to `10^5`.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Restrictions**: First, sort the `restrictions` array by the building id.
2. **Forward Pass**: Adjust the height restrictions from left to right to ensure each restriction is feasible considering the 1-difference constraint.
3. **Backward Pass**: Adjust the height restrictions from right to left for the same reason, ensuring a bidirectional feasibility.
4. **Calculate Maximum Height**: Iterate over the buildings between the sorted restrictions (and from `0` to the first restriction, and the last restriction to `n`). Calculate the maximum possible height considering the constraints.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int maxBuilding(int n, int[][] restrictions) {
        // Add boundaries for restrictions
        int m = restrictions.length;
        int[][] adjustedRestrictions = new int[m + 1][2];
        System.arraycopy(restrictions, 0, adjustedRestrictions, 0, m);
        adjustedRestrictions[m] = new int[] {n, Integer.MAX_VALUE};
        
        Arrays.sort(adjustedRestrictions, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        
        // Forward Pass
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            adjustedRestrictions[i][1] = Math.min(adjustedRestrictions[i][1], 
                adjustedRestrictions[i-1][1] + (adjustedRestrictions[i][0] - adjustedRestrictions[i-1][0]));
        }
        
        // Backward Pass
        for (int i = m - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            adjustedRestrictions[i][1] = Math.min(adjustedRestrictions[i][1], 
                adjustedRestrictions[i+1][1] + (adjustedRestrictions[i+1][0] - adjustedRestrictions[i][0]));
        }
        
        // Calculate maximum height
        int maxHeight = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            int dist = adjustedRestrictions[i][0] - adjustedRestrictions[i-1][0];
            int maxCurrentHeight = (adjustedRestrictions[i][1] + adjustedRestrictions[i-1][1] + dist) / 2;
            maxHeight = Math.max(maxHeight, maxCurrentHeight);
        }
        
        return maxHeight;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting the restrictions**: This takes O(m log m) time, where m is the number of restrictions.
2. **Forward and Backward Pass**: Both of these take O(m) time.
3. **Calculating Maximum Height**: This takes O(m) time.

Overall, the time complexity is O(m log m). The space complexity is O(m) for storing the adjusted restrictions.

This approach efficiently calculates the maximum possible height of the tallest building while ensuring all constraints are satisfied.
