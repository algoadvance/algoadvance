[Leetcode 2376. Count Special Integers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2376)
### Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer n. Count the number of positive integers less than or equal to n that do not have any repeated digits.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of n:** What is the upper limit of n? 
   - For this problem, n could be as large as 10^9.

2. **Edge Cases:** Do we consider numbers with a single digit as special integers?
   - Yes, single-digit numbers are considered special integers since they don't have any repeated digits.

3. **Return Type:** What should be the return type of the function?
   - The function should return an integer representing the count of special integers.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, the main idea is to use backtracking to generate numbers up to `n` that do not have repeated digits. 

Here are the steps:

1. **Backtracking:** Start from an empty prefix and try to add digits from `0` to `9` while ensuring no digit is repeated.
2. **Boundary Conditions:** Ensure that the generated number does not exceed `n`.
3. **Handling Leading Zeros:** Ensure that numbers do not start with zero unless the number itself is zero.
   
Essentially, we'll generate all numbers that follow the constraints and count them.

### Code

Here's one way to implement this logic in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    
    private int countSpecial(int num, boolean[] usedDigits, int n) {
        if (num > n) return 0;
        int count = 1; // Count this number if it's less than n.
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            if (usedDigits[i]) continue;
            if (num == 0 && i == 0) continue; // Skip leading 0.
            
            usedDigits[i] = true;
            count += countSpecial(num * 10 + i, usedDigits, n);
            usedDigits[i] = false;
        }
        
        return count;
    }
    
    public int countSpecialNumbers(int n) {
        boolean[] usedDigits = new boolean[10];
        return countSpecial(0, usedDigits, n) - 1; // Subtract 1 to exclude the extra count for 0.
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        
        System.out.println(solution.countSpecialNumbers(20)); // should output the count of special numbers <= 20
        System.out.println(solution.countSpecialNumbers(100)); // for 100
        System.out.println(solution.countSpecialNumbers(1000)); // for 1000
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is complex due to the recursive nature of the backtracking process. In the worst case, each call can branch out into less than 10 recursive calls, leading to a time complexity that can be approximated as `O(10^d)`, where `d` is the number of digits in `n`. This is feasible for values of `n` up to 10^9, as the recursive calls are pruned by boundary conditions.

In summary:
- **Backtracking** will be used to generate valid numbers without repeated digits.
- The boundary will ensure the generation does not exceed `n`.
- Time complexity is `O(10^d)`, where `d` is the number of digits in `n`.
