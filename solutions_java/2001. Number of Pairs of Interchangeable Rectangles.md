[Leetcode 2001. Number of Pairs of Interchangeable Rectangles](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2001)
### Problem Statement

You are given `n` rectangles represented by a 2D integer array `rectangles`, where `rectangles[i] = [widthi, heighti]` describes the `i-th` rectangle.

A rectangle `i` and a rectangle `j` (i != j) are considered interchangeable if they have the same width-to-height ratio. More formally, two rectangles `(width1, height1)` and `(width2, height2)` are interchangeable if and only if `(width1 * height2 == width2 * height1)`.

Return the number of pairs of interchangeable rectangles.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - `1 <= rectangles.length <= 10^5`
   - `1 <= widthi, heighti <= 10^5`
   - So we can assume a large input size, making efficiency crucial.

2. **Output Specifications:**
   - We need to return an integer which represents the number of pairs of interchangeable rectangles.

3. **Ratios and Floating Point Precision:**
   - We should avoid using floating-point representations for ratios due to precision issues.
   - Instead, we can use the greatest common divisor (GCD) to reduce the ratios to their smallest integer forms.

### Strategy

1. **Ratio Calculation:**
   - Instead of calculating floating-point ratios, compute a reduced ratio using GCD.
   - For each rectangle `[width, height]`, calculate `gcd(width, height)`, and use the reduced form `(width / gcd, height / gcd)` as a unique identifier for the ratio.

2. **Counting Pairs:**
   - Use a dictionary to count occurrences of each reduced ratio.
   - For each new occurrence of a ratio, if the ratio has been seen `k` times before, it can form `k` new pairs with previously seen rectangles.

3. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Initialize a dictionary to keep track of reduced ratio counts.
   - Iterate through each rectangle, compute its reduced ratio, and update the count in the dictionary.
   - Accumulate the count of pairs based on the existing counts in the dictionary.

### Code

Here's how you can implement this strategy in Java:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class InterchangeableRectangles {
    
    public long interchangeableRectangles(int[][] rectangles) {
        Map<String, Long> ratioCountMap = new HashMap<>();
        long interchangeablePairs = 0;

        for (int[] rectangle : rectangles) {
            int width = rectangle[0];
            int height = rectangle[1];
            int gcd = gcd(width, height);
            String ratio = (width / gcd) + ":" + (height / gcd);
            
            ratioCountMap.put(ratio, ratioCountMap.getOrDefault(ratio, 0L) + 1);
        }

        for (long count : ratioCountMap.values()) {
            if (count > 1) {
                interchangeablePairs += count * (count - 1) / 2;
            }
        }

        return interchangeablePairs;
    }

    private int gcd(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            int temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        InterchangeableRectangles ir = new InterchangeableRectangles();
        int[][] rectangles = { {4, 8}, {2, 4}, {1, 9}, {2, 6}, {8, 16} };
        System.out.println(ir.interchangeableRectangles(rectangles));  // Output: 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **GCD Calculation:** Each GCD calculation takes O(log(min(width, height))) due to the Euclidean algorithm.
- **Dictionary Operations:** Insertion and lookup operations in the dictionary are average O(1).

Overall, the time complexity:
- **Total Time Complexity:** O(n * log(min(width, height))). Given the constraints, this is efficient.

This approach effectively handles large input sizes within the problem's constraints.
