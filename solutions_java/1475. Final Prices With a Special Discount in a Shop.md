[Leetcode 1475. Final Prices With a Special Discount in a Shop](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1475)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of the ith item in a shop. There is a special discount rule that can be applied to each item: if you buy the item at index `i`, then you will receive a discount equivalent to the price of the next item with a lesser or equal price than `prices[i]`. If there is no such item, you will not receive any discount for that item.

Implement a method that returns an array where the value at each index `i` is the final price you will pay for the item at index `i`, considering the special discount.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: prices = [8, 4, 6, 2, 3]
Output: [4, 2, 4, 2, 3]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: prices = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: prices = [10, 1, 1, 6]
Output: [9, 0, 1, 6]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What are the constraints on the size of the `prices` array?
   **A:** Constraints are not strictly provided, but you may assume it can be reasonably large (up to 10^4).

2. **Q:** Can the prices in the `prices` array be negative?
   **A:** No, prices are non-negative integers.

3. **Q:** Can we have repeated prices in the `prices` array?
   **A:** Yes, prices can have repeated values.

4. **Q:** What is the range of values for each element in `prices`?
   **A:** Each price will be a non-negative integer and can be reasonably large.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a stack to optimize the search for the next lesser or equal price. The basic idea is to maintain a stack that helps in keeping track of the indices of prices in a way that allows us to efficiently check the next smaller or equal price for any given item.

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Iterate over the `prices` array from the end to the start.
3. For each element:
   - While the stack is not empty and the top of the stack (price) is greater than the current price, pop elements from the stack.
   - If the stack is not empty at this point, the top of the stack is the next lesser or equal price.
   - Compute the final price and store it.
   - Push the current price onto the stack.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the `prices` array. This is because each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.

### Code

Here's the Java implementation of the above strategy:

```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class Solution {
    public int[] finalPrices(int[] prices) {
        int n = prices.length;
        // Resultant array to hold the final prices
        int[] finalPrices = new int[n];
        // Stack to keep track of the indices
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        
        // Iterate over the prices array from the end to the start
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            // Remove elements from the stack that are greater than the current price
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() > prices[i]) {
                stack.pop();
            }
            // If stack is not empty, the top element is the next lesser or equal price
            finalPrices[i] = (stack.isEmpty()) ? prices[i] : prices[i] - stack.peek();
            // Push the current price onto the stack
            stack.push(prices[i]);
        }
        
        return finalPrices;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] prices1 = {8, 4, 6, 2, 3};
        int[] result1 = sol.finalPrices(prices1);
        for (int price : result1) {
            System.out.print(price + " ");
        }
        // Output: 4 2 4 2 3
        
        System.out.println();
        
        int[] prices2 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int[] result2 = sol.finalPrices(prices2);
        for (int price : result2) {
            System.out.print(price + " ");
        }
        // Output: 1 2 3 4 5
        
        System.out.println();
        
        int[] prices3 = {10, 1, 1, 6};
        int[] result3 = sol.finalPrices(prices3);
        for (int price : result3) {
            System.out.print(price + " ");
        }
        // Output: 9 0 1 6
    }
}
```

By using stack, we efficiently find the next lesser or equal price for each item, reducing time complexity significantly compared to a naive approach.
