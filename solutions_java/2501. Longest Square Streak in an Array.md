[Leetcode 2501. Longest Square Streak in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2501)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of integers `numbers`. The streak of an integer `x` in the array is the sequence of integers obtained by successively squaring `x`. For example, the streak of `2` is `(2, 4, 16, ...)`. A square streak starts at an integer `x` and continues squaring the result until the squared value no longer exists in the array.

Your task is to find the longest square streak in the array. If there is no such streak, return `0`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of values in the array?
   - How large can the array be?
   - Can the array contain duplicates?

2. **Output:**
   - If there are multiple qualifying streaks of the same length, do we return any one of them or is a specific one preferred?

3. **Streak Definition:**
   - To clarify, the streak can only contain numbers that are present in the input array?

Presuming default constraints such as:
- The array can have up to \(10^5\) elements.
- Each element in the array is a non-negative integer.
- We are to find the longest streak.

### Strategy
1. **Implementation Approach:**
   - Use a HashSet for quick look-up to verify if a squared number exists in the array.
   - Iterate over each number in the array to determine the longest streak starting from that number.
   - Track the starting number and its streak length using a while loop that continues as long as the squared result exists in the set.

2. **Detailed Steps:**
   - Convert the `numbers` array to a HashSet to facilitate O(1) look-ups.
   - Initialize a variable `max_length` to track the longest streak found.
   - For each number in the array:
     - Initialize a variable `current_length` to 0.
     - Continuously square the number and check if the result is in the set.
     - Update `max_length` if `current_length` is greater.

3. **Time Complexity:**
   - Converting the array to a HashSet takes O(n).
   - Iterating over the array and checking each number's streak could have a complexity of O(n * log(max_value)), assuming consecutive squarings up to the max_value in the array.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashSet;

public class Solution {
    public int longestSquareStreak(int[] numbers) {
        if (numbers == null || numbers.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        HashSet<Integer> numberSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (int num : numbers) {
            numberSet.add(num);
        }

        int maxLength = 0;
        
        for (int num : numbers) {
            int current = num;
            int currentLength = 0;

            while (numberSet.contains(current)) {
                currentLength++;
                current *= current;
                // Check overflow
                if (current < 0 || current > Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
                    break;
                }
            }

            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength);
        }

        return maxLength;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] numbers = {2, 4, 16, 256};
        System.out.println(solution.longestSquareStreak(numbers));  // Output: 4
    }
}
```

### Explanation
- The `numberSet` is used for O(1) membership checking.
- For each number in the array, the streak is calculated by successively squaring the number and checking its presence in the set.
- We handle potential integer overflow by breaking the loop if the squared value exceeds `Integer.MAX_VALUE`.

### Time Complexity
- **Overall Complexity:** O(n * log(max_value)), where `max_value` is the maximum possible squared value computable within array constraints, ensuring efficient identification of the longest streak.
