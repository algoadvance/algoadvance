[Leetcode 1982. Find Array Given Subset Sums](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1982)
### Problem Statement
There is an integer array `nums` that you do not know, but you do know the array `subsetSums`. `subsetSums` contains all the possible sums that can be obtained by summing up all subsets (including the empty subset) of `nums`. Write an algorithm to return the array `nums`. If there are multiple solutions, return any of them.

### Clarifying Questions
- What are the constraints on the length of the array `nums`?
  - `1 <= nums.length <= 15`
- What are the constraints on the elements of the array `nums`?
  - `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`
- Is `subsetSums` sorted in any particular order?
  - Yes, `subsetSums` will be sorted in non-decreasing order.
- Are there any duplicate numbers in `nums`?
  - There may be duplicates, as the problem does not specify that `nums` is unique.

### Strategy
1. **Sorting and Initialization**:
    - Start with sorting `subsetSums` (if not already sorted).
    - The smallest element in `subsetSums` is always `0` (sum of the empty subset), so we remove the first element of the sorted `subsetSums`.

2. **Recursive Subset Construction**:
    - Use a multiset to store elements and build the original array `nums` by extracting possible elements one by one.
    - Since each subset sum includes all possible combination sums, we can extract the smallest element at each step and rebuild the possible combinations to deduce the original elements of `nums`.

3. **Backtracking**:
    - Recursively remove elements from `subsetSums` and check all possible subsets (similar to branching in decision trees).
    - Deduce elements of `nums` by considering the difference between subsets.

4. **Reconstruction**:
    - Track and rebuild `subsetSums` iteratively till it's completely processed.

### Code

Here's the Java code reflecting the above strategy:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int[] recoverArray(int n, int[] subsetSums) {
        // Sort the subset sums
        Arrays.sort(subsetSums);
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        // Removing the sum of the empty subset, which is 0
        List<Integer> sums = new ArrayList<>();
        for(int sum : subsetSums){
            sums.add(sum);
        }
        sums.remove(0);  // remove the empty subset
        recur(sums, result, n);
        return result.stream().mapToInt(i -> i).toArray();
    }
    
    private void recur(List<Integer> sums, List<Integer> result, int n) {
        if (result.size() == n) {
            return; // Base condition
        }
        // Smallest number in the current situation
        int min = sums.get(0);
        // Create multiset with differences updated
        List<Integer> newSums = new ArrayList<>();
        Multiset<Integer> seen = new Multiset<>();
        for (int sum : sums) {
            if (seen.contains(sum)) {
                seen.remove(sum);
            } else {
                newSums.add(sum);
                seen.add(sum + min);
            }
        }
        result.add(min);
        recur(newSums, result, n);
    }
    
    private class Multiset<E> extends HashMap<E, Integer> {
        void add(E key) {
            put(key, getOrDefault(key, 0) + 1);
        }
        void remove(E key) {
            int count = get(key);
            if (count == 1) {
                remove(key);
            } else {
                put(key, count - 1);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: Sorting the `subsetSums` array takes \(O(m \log m)\), where \(m\) is the length of `subsetSums`.
- **Recursion and Backtracking**: The recursive construction will have a complexity of \(O(2^n)\) because each subset sum operation splits the problem into two (including the number or excluding it).

Overall time complexity can be considered as \(O(m \log m + 2^n)\), where \(m = 2^n\). Given the constraints (with \(n \leq 15\)), this complexity is manageable.

This solution should work efficiently given the constraint \(1 \leq n \leq 15\).
