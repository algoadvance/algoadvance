[Leetcode 2336. Smallest Number in Infinite Set full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2336)
### Problem Statement

You have a set which contains all positive integers `[1, 2, 3, ...]`. Implement a data structure `SmallestInfiniteSet` that tracks the smallest missing positive integer and allows the following operations:

1. `SmallestInfiniteSet()` Initializes the SmallestInfiniteSet object to contain all positive integers.
2. `int popSmallest()` Removes and returns the smallest positive integer from the set.
3. `void addBack(int num)` Adds a positive integer `num` back into the set, if it is missing.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: What are the constraints on the input size?
   - **A**: There are no explicit constraints provided in the problem description, but the operations should be efficient.

2. **Q**: Can `addBack` be called with a number that is already in the set?
   - **A**: No, typically `addBack` will only be called if the number is not in the current set considering the implied initial infinite set less already popped numbers.

3. **Q**: How do we initialize the set?
   - **A**: The set starts with all positive integers, but practically we can start with an implicit state and then go on modifying this state with `popSmallest` and `addBack`.

### Strategy

1. **Data Structures**:
   - Use a Min-Heap to always provide the smallest number efficiently when `popSmallest` is called. 
   - Use a HashSet to keep track of the numbers that have been removed from the heap to allow O(1) insertion checks for `addBack`.

2. **Operations**:
   - On `popSmallest()`, we return the smallest element from the heap and mark it as removed.
   - On `addBack(int num)`, if the number is not already present in the heap (i.e., it's currently considered removed), we insert it back.

### Code Implementation

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;
import java.util.HashSet;

public class SmallestInfiniteSet {
    private PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap;
    private HashSet<Integer> removedSet;
    private int next;

    public SmallestInfiniteSet() {
        minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
        removedSet = new HashSet<>();
        next = 1;
    }

    public int popSmallest() {
        if (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
            int smallest = minHeap.poll();
            removedSet.remove(smallest);
            return smallest;
        } else {
            return next++;
        }
    }

    public void addBack(int num) {
        if (num < next && !removedSet.contains(num)) {
            minHeap.add(num);
            removedSet.add(num);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage
        SmallestInfiniteSet smallestSet = new SmallestInfiniteSet();
        System.out.println(smallestSet.popSmallest()); // Expect 1
        System.out.println(smallestSet.popSmallest()); // Expect 2
        smallestSet.addBack(1);
        System.out.println(smallestSet.popSmallest()); // Expect 1
        System.out.println(smallestSet.popSmallest()); // Expect 3 (since 2 was already popped)
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Initializing the SmallestInfiniteSet**:
   - Time complexity: O(1)

2. **popSmallest()**:
   - If the heap is not empty, popping the smallest element takes `O(log N)` where `N` is the current number of elements in the heap.
   - If the heap is empty, incrementing and returning `next` takes `O(1)`.

3. **addBack(int num)**:
   - Checking if the number should be added back takes `O(1)`.
   - Adding the number to the heap takes `O(log N)`.

Overall, the dominant operations both involve the heap, thus the time complexity is `O(log N)` for both `popSmallest()` and `addBack(int num)`.
