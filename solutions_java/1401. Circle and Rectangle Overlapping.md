[Leetcode 1401. Circle and Rectangle Overlapping](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1401)
### Problem Statement
Given a circle represented as `(radius, x_center, y_center)` and an axis-aligned rectangle represented as `(x1, y1, x2, y2)`, where `(x1, y1)` is the bottom-left corner and `(x2, y2)` is the top-right corner of the rectangle, return `true` if the circle and the rectangle are overlapped otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Do the inputs always represent valid geometric shapes?**
   - Yes, the radius will always be a positive number, and `(x2, y2)` will always be greater than `(x1, y1)`.

2. **What is the definition of "overlapping"?**
   - Two shapes are considered overlapping if they have any points in common.

3. **Is it guaranteed that all inputs are integers?**
   - Yes, the problem ensures all inputs are integers.

### Strategy
1. **Find the closest point on the rectangle to the circle's center:**
   - The closest point on the rectangle to the circle's center can be determined using the axis projections of the circle center's coordinates:
     - `closestX = max(x1, min(x_center, x2))`
     - `closestY = max(y1, min(y_center, y2))`

2. **Check the distance between this closest point and the circle's center:**
   - Calculate the Euclidean distance between `(x_center, y_center)` and `(closestX, closestY)`.
   - If this distance is less than or equal to the circle's radius, the circle overlaps with the rectangle.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean checkOverlap(int radius, int x_center, int y_center, int x1, int y1, int x2, int y2) {
        // find the closest point to the center of the circle within the rectangle
        int closestX = Math.max(x1, Math.min(x_center, x2));
        int closestY = Math.max(y1, Math.min(y_center, y2));
        
        // calculate the distance between the closest point and the center of the circle
        int deltaX = x_center - closestX;
        int deltaY = y_center - closestY;
        
        // use Pythagorean theorem to check if the distance is less than or equal to the radius
        return (deltaX * deltaX + deltaY * deltaY) <= (radius * radius);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(1)** because we are performing a constant number of arithmetic operations and comparisons.

This solution efficiently determines whether or not the circle overlaps with the rectangle by leveraging geometric properties and simple mathematical computations.
