[Leetcode 974. Subarray Sums Divisible by K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l974)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the number of non-empty subarrays that have a sum divisible by `k`.

A **subarray** is a contiguous part of an array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the elements in the array `nums`?**
    - The array `nums` can contain both negative and positive integers.

2. **What is the size of the array we should consider?**
    - The size of the array can be up to `30,000` elements.

3. **Are there any constraints on the value of `k`?**
    - Yes, the value of `k` will be between `1` and `10,000`.

4. **Can there be duplicate elements in the array `nums`?**
    - Yes, the array can contain duplicate elements.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the concept of the prefix sum and a hashmap to keep track of the remainders.

1. **Prefix Sum and Remainder:** 
   - For each subarray sum `sum(i, j)` to be divisible by `k`, the remainder when `prefixSum[j]` is divided by `k` should be the same as the remainder when `prefixSum[i-1]` is divided by `k`.
   - In other words, if `(prefixSum[j] % k) == (prefixSum[i-1] % k)`, then the subarray from `i` to `j` has a sum divisible by `k`.

2. **Hashmap to Track Remainders:**
   - Use a hashmap to count the occurrences of each remainder. Initialize the hashmap with `0` remainder having a count of `1` to handle subarrays that start from the beginning of the array.
   - For each element in the array, update the prefix sum and compute the remainder when divided by `k`. If the remainder is negative, adjust it by adding `k`.
   - Increment the count by the number of times this remainder has been seen before (from the hashmap), and update the hashmap with the latest count for this remainder.

This ensures we can find the count of such subarrays efficiently in O(n) time.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public int subarraysDivByK(int[] nums, int k) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> remainderCount = new HashMap<>();
        remainderCount.put(0, 1); // To handle cases where the subarray from start has sum % k == 0
        
        int prefixSum = 0;
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            prefixSum += num;
            int remainder = prefixSum % k;
            
            // Adjust for negative remainders to keep them positive
            if (remainder < 0) {
                remainder += k;
            }
            
            // If this remainder was seen before, adding its count to the result
            if (remainderCount.containsKey(remainder)) {
                count += remainderCount.get(remainder);
            }
            
            // Update the hashmap with the current remainder count
            remainderCount.put(remainder, remainderCount.getOrDefault(remainder, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - We iterate through the array exactly once, updating the prefix sum and hashmap in constant time operations.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(min(n, k))
  - The space used by the hashmap is proportional to the number of unique remainders, which can be at most `k` but typically will be less, especially when `k` is large compared to `n`.
