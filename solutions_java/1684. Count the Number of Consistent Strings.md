[Leetcode 1684. Count the Number of Consistent Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1684)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `allowed` consisting of distinct characters and an array of strings `words`. A string is consistent if all characters in the string appear in the string `allowed`.

Return the number of consistent strings in the array `words`.

#### Example
- Example 1:
  - Input: `allowed = "ab"`, `words = ["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"]`
  - Output: `2`
  - Explanation: Strings "aaab" and "baa" are consistent since they only contain characters 'a' and 'b'.
  
- Example 2:
  - Input: `allowed = "abc"`, `words = ["a","b","c","ab","ac","bc","abc"]`
  - Output: `7`
  
- Example 3:
  - Input: `allowed = "cad"`, `words = ["cc","acd","b","ba","bac","bad","ac","d"]`
  - Output: `4`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the `allowed` string be empty?**
   - No, the problem specifies that the `allowed` string consists of distinct characters, so it cannot be empty.
   
2. **What are the constraints on the length of `allowed` and `words`?**
   - The length of `allowed` is in the range `[1, 26]`.
   - The length of `words` is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
   - The length of each word in `words` is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
   - `words[i]` and `allowed` consist of only lowercase English letters.

### Strategy
1. **Utilize a Set for `allowed` Characters:**
   - Convert the `allowed` string into a set of characters for faster lookup.
   
2. **Iterate Over Each Word:**
   - For each word in `words`, check if all characters are in the `allowed` set.
   
3. **Count Consistent Strings:**
   - Maintain a counter to keep track of words where all characters are in the `allowed` set.
   
### Code Implementation

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class Solution {
    public int countConsistentStrings(String allowed, String[] words) {
        // Convert the allowed string into a set for fast lookup
        Set<Character> allowedSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (char ch : allowed.toCharArray()) {
            allowedSet.add(ch);
        }
        
        int count = 0; // Initialize the counter for consistent strings
        
        // Iterate through each word in the array
        for (String word : words) {
            boolean isConsistent = true;
            for (char ch : word.toCharArray()) {
                if (!allowedSet.contains(ch)) {
                    isConsistent = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (isConsistent) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count; // Return the number of consistent strings
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.countConsistentStrings("ab", new String[]{"ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"})); // Output: 2
        System.out.println(sol.countConsistentStrings("abc", new String[]{"a","b","c","ab","ac","bc","abc"})); // Output: 7
        System.out.println(sol.countConsistentStrings("cad", new String[]{"cc","acd","b","ba","bac","bad","ac","d"})); // Output: 4
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Converting `allowed` to a Set:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the `allowed` string.
- **Checking Each Word:** O(m*k), where `m` is the number of words and `k` is the average length of a word in `words`.

Overall, the time complexity is O(n + m*k), which is efficient given the problem constraints.
