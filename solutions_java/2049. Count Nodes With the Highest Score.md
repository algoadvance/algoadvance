[Leetcode 2049. Count Nodes With the Highest Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2049)
## Problem Statement

Given a binary tree rooted at `root`, the size of each subtree is the number of nodes in that subtree. The score of a node is defined as the product of the sizes of the subtrees formed when the node is deleted.

The task is to find the number of nodes with the highest score.

A nodeâ€™s score is defined as:
- The product of the number of nodes in the left subtree.
- The product of the number of nodes in the right subtree.
- The product of the number of nodes in the rest of the tree formed by deleting this node.

The score of a single node equals 1 (since it's the only node in its subtree). If the node is removed, we consider 1 for the empty subtrees.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the structure of the input tree?**  
    The tree is represented as an array, where `parent[i] = j` represents `i-th` node's parent node `j`.
    
2. **Is the tree guaranteed to be binary?**  
    Yes, it is a binary tree.

3. **What is the constraint on the number of nodes?**  
    The number of nodes will be in the range `[1, 10^5]`.

## Strategy

1. **Parse the Tree Structure:**
   - Construct the tree using the parent array.
   - Use an adjacency list to store the tree nodes.
   
2. **DFS Traversal for Subtree Sizes and Scores:**
   - Use DFS to compute the size of each subtree.
   - Calculate the score for each node and track the maximum score.
   
3. **Count Nodes with Maximum Score:**
   - Traverse through the scores and count the nodes having the highest score.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int countHighestScoreNodes(int[] parents) {
        int n = parents.length;
        List<Integer>[] tree = new ArrayList[n];

        // Initialize the adjacency list
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            tree[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }

        // Build the tree using parent array
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            tree[parents[i]].add(i);
        }

        // Array to store the size of each subtree
        int[] size = new int[n];

        // Perform DFS to compute the subtree sizes
        long[] scores = new long[n];
        dfs(0, tree, size, scores, n);

        // Find and count the nodes with the maximum score
        long maxScore = 0;
        int maxCount = 0;

        for (long score : scores) {
            if (score > maxScore) {
                maxScore = score;
                maxCount = 1;
            } else if (score == maxScore) {
                maxCount++;
            }
        }

        return maxCount;
    }

    private int dfs(int node, List<Integer>[] tree, int[] size, long[] scores, int n) {
        size[node] = 1; // Include the node itself
        long score = 1;

        // Calculate subtree sizes
        for (int child : tree[node]) {
            int childSize = dfs(child, tree, size, scores, n);
            size[node] += childSize; // Update the size of the subtree
            score *= childSize; // Multiply the scores of subtrees
        }

        // Nodes outside the current node's subtree
        int rest = n - size[node];
        if (rest > 0) {
            score *= rest; // Multiply by the size of the rest of the nodes
        }

        scores[node] = score; // Store the score for the current node
        return size[node];
    }
}

```

## Time Complexity

1. **Building the Tree:**
   - Constructing the tree takes O(n) where `n` is the number of nodes.

2. **DFS Traversal:**
   - The DFS traversal to compute subtree sizes and scores also takes O(n).

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n)`, which is efficient for input constraints upto `10^5` nodes.
