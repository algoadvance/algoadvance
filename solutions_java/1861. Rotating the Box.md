[Leetcode 1861. Rotating the Box](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1861)
### Problem Statement
You are given an `m x n` matrix of characters `box` representing a side-view of a box. Each cell in the box is one of the following:

* A stone `'#'`.
* A stationary obstacle `'*'`.
* Empty `'.'`.

The box is rotated 90 degrees clockwise, causing some of the stones to fall due to gravity. Each stone falls down until it lands on another stone, an obstacle, or the bottom of the box. Gravity does not affect obstacles' positions, and the inertia from the rotation does not affect the `#` symbols' falling after the rotation.

Write an algorithm to rotate the box 90 degrees clockwise and return the new state of the box.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size**: What are the constraints on the dimensions of the box?
   - The size of the box matrix can be `1 <= m, n <= 100`.

2. **Rotation**: Should we consider modifying the matrix in place, or creating a new matrix to reflect the rotated state?
   - We will create a new matrix to reflect the rotated state.

3. **Gravity Effect**: Should stones (`#`) fall down immediately after the rotation, or after checking the new matrix state?
   - Stones (`#`) should fall down according to the new rotated matrix state.

### Strategy
1. **Initial Setup**: Create a new matrix `result` to accommodate the rotated box.
2. **Rotation**: Rotate the box 90 degrees clockwise.
    - For element `box[i][j]`, it will be placed in `result[j][n-i-1]`.
3. **Gravity Simulation**: Iterate over each column of the rotated matrix to simulate gravity.
    - Move stones down to the lowest available position in the same column without changing the relative horizontal order.
4. **Return**: Return the resultant matrix after processing.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public char[][] rotateTheBox(char[][] box) {
        int m = box.length;
        int n = box[0].length;
        char[][] result = new char[n][m];
        
        // Rotate the box
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                result[j][m - 1 - i] = box[i][j];
            }
        }
        
        // Apply gravity in the resultant matrix
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            int emptyRow = m - 1; // The row where the next stone will fall
            for (int i = m - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
                if (result[j][i] == '*') {
                    emptyRow = i - 1;
                } else if (result[j][i] == '#') {
                    result[j][i] = '.';
                    result[j][emptyRow] = '#';
                    emptyRow--;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Rotation Step**: O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns, as each element is placed in its rotated position.
2. **Gravity Simulation**: O(m * n), every stone may fall individually and we need to iterate over every element.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(m * n). The space complexity is also O(m * n) for the resulting matrix.
