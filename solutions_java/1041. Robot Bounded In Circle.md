[Leetcode 1041. Robot Bounded In Circle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1041)
### Problem Statement
LeetCode Problem 1041: Robot Bounded In Circle

The problem is defined as follows:

On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at (0, 0) and faces north. The robot can receive one of three instructions:

- "G": Go straight 1 unit.
- "L": Turn 90 degrees to the left.
- "R": Turn 90 degrees to the right.

The robot performs the instructions given in a string `instructions` repeatedly forever. Return `true` if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What are the possible directions the robot can face?
   **A:** The robot starts facing North (upward). By turning left or right, it can also face West, South, or East.

2. **Q:** Does the "forever" imply that we can stop checking after some finite series of instructions to determine cyclic behavior?
   **A:** Yes, the problem can be reduced to checking the robot's position and orientation after one set of instructions. If it returns to the starting point or faces a different direction, it implies being bounded in a circle.

### Strategy
1. Start at the origin (0, 0) and face north.
2. Track the direction as an array in which the index corresponds to:
   - 0: North
   - 1: East
   - 2: South
   - 3: West
3. Process each instruction and update position and direction variables accordingly.
4. At the end of processing the instructions:
   - If the robot is back at the origin, it forms a circle.
   - If the robot is not facing North, it implies that repeated instructions would eventually form a circle.
5. If neither of the above conditions is met, the robot is not bounded by a circle.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean isRobotBounded(String instructions) {
        // Directions array to simplify handling of turns
        int[][] directions = { {0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0} };
        // Starting point
        int x = 0, y = 0;
        int dir = 0;     // 0: North, 1: East, 2: South, 3: West

        for (char instruction : instructions.toCharArray()) {
            if (instruction == 'G') {
                // Move in the direction we are currently facing.
                x += directions[dir][0];
                y += directions[dir][1];
            } else if (instruction == 'L') {
                // Turn Left: (dir + 3) % 4 moves to the left of current direction in cyclic order.
                dir = (dir + 3) % 4;
            } else if (instruction == 'R') {
                // Turn right: (dir + 1) % 4 moves to the right of current direction in cyclic order.
                dir = (dir + 1) % 4;
            }
        }

        // There are two reasons to return true:
        // 1. The robot returns to the origin.
        // 2. The robot does not face North, meaning it will stay in a loop.
        return (x == 0 && y == 0) || (dir != 0);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is \( O(n) \), where \( n \) is the length of the instruction string. This is because each instruction is processed exactly once.
- The space complexity is \( O(1) \) as only a fixed amount of additional space is needed to store coordinates and direction.

With this strategy and implementation, we can decisively determine whether the robot is bounded within a circle given the repeatability of the instructions.
