[Leetcode 464. Can I Win](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l464)
## Problem Statement
You are given two integers `maxChoosableInteger` and `desiredTotal`. You can only choose an integer from 1 to `maxChoosableInteger` each time. Each integer can only be chosen once. The player who makes the total sum reach or exceed the `desiredTotal` first is the winner.

Assume that both players play optimally. Return `true` if the first player to move can force a win, otherwise return `false`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on `maxChoosableInteger` and `desiredTotal`?**
   - `1 <= maxChoosableInteger <= 20`
   - `0 <= desiredTotal <= 300`
2. **Can `desiredTotal` be zero?**
   - Yes, if `desiredTotal` is zero, the first player automatically loses because they cannot make a move and hence cannot win.
3. **Is it guaranteed that `maxChoosableInteger` will be enough to reach the `desiredTotal`?**
   - This needs to be checked within the function. If the sum of the sequence `1 + 2 + ... + maxChoosableInteger` is less than `desiredTotal`, it's impossible for any player to win.

## Strategy
1. **Edge Case**:
   - If `desiredTotal` is `0` the first player loses by definition since no moves lead to a win.
   
2. **Sum Check**:
   - If the sum of all numbers from `1` to `maxChoosableInteger` is less than `desiredTotal`, then it's impossible for any player to reach the `desiredTotal`. Return `false` in this case.

3. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization**:
   - Use a combination of bit masking and memoization to keep track of visited states.
   - A recursive helper function will determine whether the current player can force a win given the current state of choices.

4. **Recursive Logic**:
   - From the current state, the player tries each available move (i.e., picking each unused number). Then, recursively solve for the new state (with the chosen number removed from available choices).
   - If any move leads to a situation where the opponent is destined to lose, the current state is a winning state.

## Code
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {

    public boolean canIWin(int maxChoosableInteger, int desiredTotal) {
        int sum = (maxChoosableInteger * (maxChoosableInteger + 1)) / 2;

        // If the sum of all available numbers is less than the desiredTotal, there's no way to reach the target
        if (sum < desiredTotal) {
            return false;
        }

        // Use memoization to remember previously computed states
        Map<Integer, Boolean> memo = new HashMap<>();
        
        return canIWinHelper(maxChoosableInteger, desiredTotal, 0, memo);
    }

    private boolean canIWinHelper(int maxChoosableInteger, int total, int usedNumbers, Map<Integer, Boolean> memo) {
        if (total <= 0) {
            return false;
        }

        if (memo.containsKey(usedNumbers)) {
            return memo.get(usedNumbers);
        }

        for (int i = 1; i <= maxChoosableInteger; i++) {
            int currentMask = (1 << i);

            // If the number i is already used, continue
            if ((usedNumbers & currentMask) != 0) {
                continue;
            }

            // If choosing i wins the game, or forces the opponent to lose on their turn
            if (total - i <= 0 || !canIWinHelper(maxChoosableInteger, total - i, usedNumbers | currentMask, memo)) {
                memo.put(usedNumbers, true);
                return true;
            }
        }

        memo.put(usedNumbers, false);
        return false;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity is difficult to determine precisely because the problem is inherently exponential in nature with respect to `maxChoosableInteger`.
- However, memoization significantly trims down the number of recursive calls by storing and re-using results of previously computed states. 
- In the worst case, the complexity is `O(2^N * N)` where `N` is `maxChoosableInteger` because there are `2^N` possible combinations of states and for each state, we may check up to `N` possibilities.
