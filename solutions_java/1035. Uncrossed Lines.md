[Leetcode 1035. Uncrossed Lines full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1035)
### Problem Statement
Leetcode 1035: Uncrossed Lines

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`. We write the integers of `nums1` and `nums2` (in the same order) on two separate horizontal lines.

We may draw connecting lines: a straight line connecting `nums1[i]` to `nums2[j]`. Each connecting line must intersect none of the other connecting lines.

Return the maximum number of connecting lines we can draw in this way.

### Example
- **Example 1:**
  ``` 
  Input: nums1 = [1,4,2], nums2 = [1,2,4]
  Output: 2
  Explanation: We can draw 2 uncrossed lines as in the diagram below:
  1----1
        \
        2----2
  ```

- **Example 2:**
  ```
  Input: nums1 = [2,5,1,2,5], nums2 = [10,5,2,1,5,2]
  Output: 3
  ```

- **Example 3:**
  ```
  Input: nums1 = [1,3,7,1,7,5], nums2 = [1,9,2,5,1]
  Output: 2
  ```

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the maximum length of nums1 and nums2?
   - Both arrays will have a length between 1 and 500.
2. Will there be negative numbers or zero in the arrays?
   - No, both arrays will contain positive integers.
3. Do we need to maintain the order of the elements?
   - Yes, elements must be matched in order.

### Strategy
This problem can be solved using dynamic programming. Specifically, it is similar to the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) problem. 

- We will create a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of uncrossed lines between the first `i` elements of `nums1` and the first `j` elements of `nums2`.
- The DP formula will be as follows: 
  - If `nums1[i-1] == nums2[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`.
  - Otherwise, `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.
- Finally, the value at `dp[len(nums1)][len(nums2)]` will be the largest number of uncrossed lines.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxUncrossedLines(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int m = nums1.length;
        int n = nums2.length;

        // Create DP table
        int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];

        // Fill the DP table
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                if (nums1[i - 1] == nums2[j - 1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        // Return the result which is the value at the bottom-right corner of the table
        return dp[m][n];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n)` where `m` is the length of `nums1` and `n` is the length of `nums2`, because we need to fill each cell of the DP table.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(m * n)` for the DP table storage. We could optimize it to `O(min(m, n))` space by using two arrays instead of a 2D array.

This solution is efficient given the constraints of the problem (with lengths up to 500).
