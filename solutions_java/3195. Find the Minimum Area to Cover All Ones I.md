[Leetcode 3195. Find the Minimum Area to Cover All Ones I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3195)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D grid of `0`s and `1`s. Your task is to find the smallest rectangle (aligned to the axes) that can cover all the cells containing `1`s in this grid. You need to return the area of that rectangle.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input size**: What are the constraints on the size of the grid (number of rows and columns)?
2. **Grid content**: Can the grid be empty or contain only `0`s?
3. **Output for special cases**: What should be the output if there are no `1`s in the grid?

For the sake of this problem, let's assume the grid will not be empty and will contain at least one `1`.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Boundaries**: 
    - Traverse the grid to find the minimum and maximum indices for rows (`minRow` and `maxRow`) and columns (`minCol` and `maxCol`) that contain `1`s.
    
2. **Compute Area**:
    - The smallest rectangle that can cover all `1`s will be defined by these boundaries. The area can be calculated as:
      \[
      \text{Area} = (\text{maxRow} - \text{minRow} + 1) \times (\text{maxCol} - \text{minCol} + 1)
      \]

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minArea(char[][] image) {
        int rows = image.length;
        int cols = image[0].length;

        int minRow = rows, maxRow = -1, minCol = cols, maxCol = -1;

        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                if (image[i][j] == '1') {
                    if (i < minRow) minRow = i;
                    if (i > maxRow) maxRow = i;
                    if (j < minCol) minCol = j;
                    if (j > maxCol) maxCol = j;
                }
            }
        }

        if (minRow == rows) {
            // No '1's were found
            return 0;
        }

        // Calculate the area of the smallest rectangle covering all '1's
        return (maxRow - minRow + 1) * (maxCol - minCol + 1);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is \(O(m \times n)\), where \(m\) is the number of rows and \(n\) is the number of columns in the grid. This is because we need to traverse each cell in the grid to determine the bounding coordinates.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(1)\) because we only use a fixed amount of extra space for variables (`minRow`, `maxRow`, `minCol`, `maxCol`), regardless of the input size.
