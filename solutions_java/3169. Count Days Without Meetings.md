[Leetcode 3169. Count Days Without Meetings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3169)
### Problem Statement

You are organizing a company project and need to keep track of the meetings. The project lasts for `n` days. You have an array `meetings`, where `meetings[i]` indicates that a meeting is held on day `meetings[i]`. You need to return the number of days in the project that do not have any meetings.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= n <= 10^4`
- `1 <= meetings.length <= n`
- `1 <= meetings[i] <= n`
- The `meetings` array may contain duplicate days.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the meetings array contain duplicates?**
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicate meeting days.

2. **Is the output an integer indicating the number of days without meetings?**
   - Yes, the output should be a single integer representing the number of days without any meetings.

3. **Are the days in the meetings array guaranteed to be within the project duration from 1 to n?**
   - Yes, each element in the `meetings` array is guaranteed to be between `1` and `n`.

### Strategy

1. **Data Structure Choice:**
   - Use a boolean array `hasMeeting` of size `n+1` (indexing from 1 to `n`) initialized to `false`.
   - Set `hasMeeting[day]` to `true` for each day `day` in the `meetings` array.

2. **Count Days Without Meetings:**
   - Iterate through the boolean array from index `1` to `n` and count the `false` values which indicate days without meetings.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int countDaysWithoutMeetings(int n, int[] meetings) {
        boolean[] hasMeeting = new boolean[n + 1];
        
        // Mark the days with meetings
        for (int day : meetings) {
            hasMeeting[day] = true;
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        
        // Count days without meetings
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (!hasMeeting[i]) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }

    // Example usage
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int n = 10;
        int[] meetings = {2, 3, 3, 5, 7};
        System.out.println(sol.countDaysWithoutMeetings(n, meetings)); // Output: 6
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**
  - Marking days in the boolean array: `O(m)`, where `m` is the length of the `meetings` array.
  - Counting days without meetings: `O(n)`, scanning the boolean array.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The boolean array `hasMeeting` requires `O(n)` space.

Hence, the solution works in `O(m + n)` time complexity and requires `O(n)` additional space.
