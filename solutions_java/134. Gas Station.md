[Leetcode 134. Gas Station](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l134)
### Problem Statement

There are `n` gas stations along a circular route, where the amount of gas at the `i-th` station is represented by `gas[i]`. You have a car with an unlimited gas tank and it costs `cost[i]` of gas to travel from the `i-th` station to its next `(i + 1)-th` station. You begin the journey with an empty tank at one of the gas stations.

Return the starting gas station's index if you can travel around the circuit once in the clockwise direction, otherwise return -1.

Example:
``` 
Input: 
gas  = [1,2,3,4,5]
cost = [3,4,5,1,2]

Output: 3

Input:
gas  = [2,3,4]
cost = [3,4,3]

Output: -1
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the input guaranteed to always have at least one station?**
    - Yes, as per the problem description, `n >= 1`.
2. **Can `gas[i]` and `cost[i]` be negative or zero?**
    - Both `gas[i]` and `cost[i]` are non-negative integers.
3. **Can we assume that gas stations are on a circular route, meaning after the last station, the next station is the first one?**
    - Yes, the route is circular.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a greedy approach for simplicity and efficiency:

1. **Check Total Feasibility:**
    - First, if the total amount of gas available is less than the total amount of gas required (`sum(gas) < sum(cost)`), the trip is impossible, and we should return `-1`.

2. **Finding the Starting Point:**
    - If `sum(gas) >= sum(cost)`:
        - Initialize two variables: `total_tank` and `current_tank` to 0, and a variable `starting_station` to 0.
        - Traverse through each station:
            - Update `total_tank` by adding the net gas at the current station (`gas[i] - cost[i]`).
            - Update `current_tank` similarly.
            - If `current_tank` drops below 0, it means you cannot reach the next station from the current starting station. Therefore, set the next station as the new starting station and reset `current_tank` to 0.
        - After the loop, if `total_tank` is non-negative, return the `starting_station`, otherwise return `-1`.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int canCompleteCircuit(int[] gas, int[] cost) {
        int totalTank = 0;
        int currentTank = 0;
        int startingStation = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < gas.length; i++) {
            int netGas = gas[i] - cost[i];
            totalTank += netGas;
            currentTank += netGas;
            
            if (currentTank < 0) {
                startingStation = i + 1;
                currentTank = 0;
            }
        }
        
        return totalTank >= 0 ? startingStation : -1;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
    - We traverse the array only once, making the algorithm linear in terms of the input size.

- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
    - We use a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
