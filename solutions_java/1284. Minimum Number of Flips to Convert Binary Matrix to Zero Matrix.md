[Leetcode 1284. Minimum Number of Flips to Convert Binary Matrix to Zero Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1284)
### Problem Statement

Given a m x n binary matrix consisting only of 0s and 1s, you can choose any cell and flip it and all the four neighbors of it if they exist (Flip is changing 0 to 1 and 1 to 0). A binary matrix is a zero matrix if all the elements are 0. Return the minimum number of steps required to convert a given binary matrix to a zero matrix. If it's not possible, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format**: Are all the cells initially guaranteed to be either 0 or 1?
   - Yes, the matrix is guaranteed to be binary.
  
2. **Matrix Size**: Is there an upper limit on the size of the matrix?
   - For most competitive programming problems, the constraints are set such that an efficient algorithm should perform within acceptable limits. Typically, m and n could be up to 10.

3. **Edge Cases**: Should we consider the case where the matrix is already a zero matrix?
   - Yes, in that case, the output should be 0.

### Strategy

We can apply Breadth-First Search (BFS) to solve this problem since it is suitable for finding the shortest path or minimum steps in an unweighted graph.

1. **State Representation**: Each matrix state can be represented as a string for easier manipulation and comparison.
2. **State Transition**: Flipping a cell and its neighbors can be seen as a state transition.
3. **Initial State**: Convert the initial matrix into its string representation.
4. **Target State**: The target state is a string with all zeros.
5. **BFS Implementation**:
   - Utilize a queue to implement BFS.
   - Use a set to keep track of visited states to avoid reprocessing the same state.
   - For each state, generate all possible next states by flipping the cells in the valid positions.
   - Whenever the target state is reached, return the number of steps taken.
   - If the queue is exhausted without reaching the target state, return -1.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int minFlips(int[][] mat) {
        int m = mat.length, n = mat[0].length;
        String start = toString(mat);
        String target = "0".repeat(m * n);
        
        // Early exit if already the target state
        if (start.equals(target)) return 0;
        
        Queue<String> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
        
        queue.add(start);
        visited.add(start);
        int steps = 0;
        
        int[][] directions = {{0, 0}, {1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int size = queue.size();
            steps++;
            while (size-- > 0) {
                String current = queue.poll();
                for (int k = 0; k < m * n; k++) {
                    int i = k / n, j = k % n;
                    String next = flip(current, i, j, m, n, directions);
                    if (visited.contains(next)) continue;
                    if (next.equals(target)) return steps;
                    queue.add(next);
                    visited.add(next);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
    
    private String toString(int[][] mat) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int[] row : mat) {
            for (int cell : row) {
                sb.append(cell);
            }
        }
        return sb.toString();
    }
    
    private String flip(String state, int i, int j, int m, int n, int[][] directions) {
        char[] ch = state.toCharArray();
        for (int[] dir : directions) {
            int ni = i + dir[0], nj = j + dir[1];
            if (ni >= 0 && ni < m && nj >= 0 && nj < n) {
                int pos = ni * n + nj;
                ch[pos] = ch[pos] == '0' ? '1' : '0';
            }
        }
        return new String(ch);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **State Space**: There are `2^(m*n)` possible states.
2. **BFS Operations**: Each state generates up to `m*n` new states.
3. **Overall Complexity**: O(2^(m*n) * (m * n)), which is feasible for small matrices (e.g., m, n â‰¤ 3).

This implementation ensures that we exhaustively search through all possible matrices configurations using BFS, guaranteeing an optimal solution for small matrix dimensions.
