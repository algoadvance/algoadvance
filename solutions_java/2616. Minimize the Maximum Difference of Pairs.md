[Leetcode 2616. Minimize the Maximum Difference of Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2616)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `p`. You need to pair up the elements of `nums` into `p` pairs such that the maximum difference among the pairs is minimized. Every element of `nums` must belong to exactly one of the pairs.

Return the minimized maximum difference.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `p` be zero?**
   - If `p` is zero, it essentially means no pairs need to be formed, thus the answer should be 0.
2. **What is the range of values for `nums`?**
   - Typically, integers, possibly within the constraints of standard problem (e.g., `-10^6` to `10^6`).
3. **Do all elements need to be paired?**
   - Yes, every element must belong to exactly one of the pairs, and you must form exactly `p` pairs.
4. **What if the input `nums` has an odd number of elements?**
   - The problem assumes valid input where `nums` will have an even number of elements since you need to form `p` pairs (`2p` elements).

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Array**: Begin by sorting the `nums` array. This helps in easily accessing elements to form pairs with minimum differences.
2. **Binary Search on Maximum Difference**: Utilize binary search to determine the optimal maximum difference (`max_diff`) that can be achieved.
3. **Greedy Pair Formation**: For a given `max_diff` value (midpoint of binary search), try to form pairs greedily. Check if it's possible to form exactly `p` pairs such that no pair has a difference greater than `max_diff`.

### Code

Here's the implementation in Java:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MinimizeMaxDifference {
    public int minimizeMaxDifference(int[] nums, int p) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums[nums.length - 1] - nums[0];
        
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            if (canFormPairs(nums, p, mid)) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return left;
    }
    
    private boolean canFormPairs(int[] nums, int p, int maxDiff) {
        int pairsFormed = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] - nums[i - 1] <= maxDiff) {
                pairsFormed++;
                i++; // Skip the next element as it's already paired
            }
            
            if (pairsFormed >= p) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimizeMaxDifference minimizeMaxDiff = new MinimizeMaxDifference();
        int[] nums = {1, 3, 6, 19, 20};
        int p = 2;
        System.out.println(minimizeMaxDiff.minimizeMaxDifference(nums, p)); // Output should be optimized maximum difference
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array.
- **Binary Search**: Each step of binary search reduces the search space by half. The range for maximum difference is `O(n)`.
- **Greedy Pair Formation**: `O(n)` for each binary search check.

So, the overall complexity is dominated by the sorting step, giving us `O(n log n)`.

### Conclusion

This approach ensures that pairs are formed optimally to minimize the maximum difference, using a combination of greedy strategy and binary search for efficiency.
