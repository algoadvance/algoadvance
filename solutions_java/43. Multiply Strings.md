[Leetcode 43. Multiply Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l43)
### Problem Statement

Given two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` represented as strings, return the product of `num1` and `num2` as a string.

**Note:**
1. The numbers represented by `num1` and `num2` are non-negative.
2. You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or directly convert the inputs to integers.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of `num1` and `num2`?
     - **Assumption:** The length of the strings `num1` and `num2` will not exceed 200.
   
2. **Output Specification:**
   - Should the result handle leading zeroes?
     - **Assumption:** The result should not contain leading zeros unless the result is "0".

### Strategy

To solve this problem without converting the entire string to an integer (which might overflow), we can employ elementary school multiplication:

1. **Initialize:** Create an array `result` of size `num1.length() + num2.length()` to store intermediate results.
2. **Multiply:** Loop through each digit of `num1` and `num2`, multiply the digits, and store the results in appropriate positions in the `result` array.
3. **Carry Handling:** Handle carry-over values as you populate the `result` array.
4. **Construct the Result:** Convert the `result` array to a string while skipping any leading zeros.

### Code

Here is the Java implementation of the solution:

```java
public class Solution {
    public String multiply(String num1, String num2) {
        int len1 = num1.length();
        int len2 = num2.length();
        int[] result = new int[len1 + len2];

        // Reverse iterate both strings
        for (int i = len1 - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = len2 - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                int mul = (num1.charAt(i) - '0') * (num2.charAt(j) - '0');
                int p1 = i + j;
                int p2 = i + j + 1;
                int sum = mul + result[p2];

                result[p1] += sum / 10;
                result[p2] = sum % 10;
            }
        }

        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int num : result) {
            if (!(sb.length() == 0 && num == 0)) { // Skip leading zeros
                sb.append(num);
            }
        }

        return sb.length() == 0 ? "0" : sb.toString();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.multiply("123", "456")); // Expected output: "56088"
        System.out.println(sol.multiply("0", "2345"));   // Expected output: "0"
        System.out.println(sol.multiply("999", "999"));  // Expected output: "998001"
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n \times m)\), where \(n\) is the length of `num1` and \(m\) is the length of `num2`. This is because we perform a nested loop multiplying each digit of `num1` with each digit of `num2`.
  
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n + m)\), which is the space required for the `result` array to store the intermediate results.
