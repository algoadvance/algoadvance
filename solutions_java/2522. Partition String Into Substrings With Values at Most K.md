[Leetcode 2522. Partition String Into Substrings With Values at Most K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2522)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting of digits from 0 to 9 and an integer `k`. The string `s` can be partitioned into one or more substrings such that the numerical values of the substrings do not exceed `k`. Return the minimum number of partitions required to achieve this. Note that each substring must be a non-empty string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Inputs:** What are the constraints on the length of `s` and the value of `k`?
   - **Response:** Typically, constraints for similar problems might be:
     - `1 <= s.length <= 100`
     - `1 <= k <= 10^9`

2. **Leading Zeroes:** Can the substrings have leading zeroes?
   - **Response:** No, as the substrings should represent valid numerical values, leading zeroes should be considered invalid unless the substring itself is "0".

3. **Special Cases:** What should the function return if `s` is empty?
   - **Response:** If `s` is empty, we return 0 as there are no substrings to partition.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:** Start with an empty temporary substring `temp_str` and a partition count `part_count` initialized to 0.
2. **Loop through Characters:** Iterate through each character in the string `s`.
3. **Form Substrings:** Append the current character to `temp_str` and check if its numerical value exceeds `k`.
   - If `temp_str` is valid (≤ `k`), continue.
   - If `temp_str` exceeds `k`, increment the `part_count`, reset `temp_str` to the current character.
4. **Final Increment:** After the loop, if `temp_str` is non-empty, increment `part_count` once more for the last formed substring.
   
### Time Complexity

- **O(N):** The algorithm requires a single pass through the string `s`, making it efficient for the given constraints.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minPartitions(String s, int k) {
        int partCount = 0;
        StringBuilder tempStr = new StringBuilder();
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            tempStr.append(c);
            if (Long.parseLong(tempStr.toString()) > k) {
                partCount++;
                tempStr.setLength(0);  // Clear tempStr
                tempStr.append(c);
            }
        }
        if (tempStr.length() > 0) {
            partCount++;
        }
        
        return partCount;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        // Example usage:
        System.out.println(sol.minPartitions("165462", 60)); // Output should be 4
        System.out.println(sol.minPartitions("238182", 5));  // Output should be 6
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization:** `partCount` stores the number of partitions. `tempStr` helps in forming potential substrings.
2. **Looping:** For each character in the string:
   - Append to `tempStr` and check if the formed number is valid (≤ `k`).
   - If it becomes invalid, increment `partCount`, reset `tempStr`.
3. **Final Check:** After the loop, check if there is any remaining substring in `tempStr`, which needs to be counted as a partition.

This solution ensures that the number of partitions is minimized while respecting the constraint that each substring’s value does not exceed `k`.
