[Leetcode 2165. Smallest Value of the Rearranged Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2165)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer `num`, you need to rearrange its digits such that its value is minimized. If the integer is negative, you need to minimize the magnitude of the number.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are leading zeros allowed in the result?**
   - No, the resulting number should not have leading zeros if it can be avoided.
   
2. **How should negative numbers be handled?**
   - For negative numbers, we should minimize the magnitude by rearranging the digits to get the smallest possible value with a negative sign.

3. **Are there any constraints on `num`?**
   - The constraints are not clarified here, but there can be assumptions about typical integer size limits (e.g., within 32-bit integer range).

### Strategy

1. **Separate the logic for positive and negative numbers**:
   - For positive numbers:
     - Convert the number to a string, split it into digits, sort the digits in ascending order, and put them back together.
     - Make sure to handle the case where the minimum number starts with zeroes by finding the first non-zero digit and placing it at the start.
   
2. **For negative numbers**:
   - Convert the number to a string (excluding the negative sign), split it into digits, sort the digits in descending order, and put them back together, adding the negative sign back at the front.

### Code

Here is the implementation of the above strategy in Java:

```java
class Solution {
    public long smallestNumber(long num) {
        if (num == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        boolean isNegative = num < 0;
        String strNum = Long.toString(Math.abs(num));
        
        char[] digits = strNum.toCharArray();
        Arrays.sort(digits);
        
        if (isNegative) {
            // For negative numbers: sort in descending order
            StringBuilder sortedDesc = new StringBuilder(new String(digits)).reverse();
            return -Long.parseLong(sortedDesc.toString());
        } else {
            // For positive numbers: sort in ascending order and manage leading zeros
            StringBuilder sortedAsc = new StringBuilder(new String(digits));
            
            // If there's a leading zero, shift it to the correct position.
            int firstNonZeroIndex = 0;
            while (firstNonZeroIndex < sortedAsc.length() && sortedAsc.charAt(firstNonZeroIndex) == '0') {
                firstNonZeroIndex++;
            }
            if (firstNonZeroIndex < sortedAsc.length()) {
                char firstNonZeroChar = sortedAsc.charAt(firstNonZeroIndex);
                sortedAsc.deleteCharAt(firstNonZeroIndex);
                sortedAsc.insert(0, firstNonZeroChar);
            }
            
            return Long.parseLong(sortedAsc.toString());
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: Sorting the digits takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of digits in the number.
- **Overall**: The main operation is the sorting step, so the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

This approach efficiently handles both positive and negative numbers by sorting the digits appropriately and ensuring no leading zeros are present in the final result (for positive numbers).
