[Leetcode 2368. Reachable Nodes With Restrictions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2368)
## Problem Statement

You are given an undirected tree with `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n-1`, and an array `edges` of length `n-1` where `edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `a_i` and `b_i` in the tree. You are also given a list `restricted` which indicates that certain nodes are restricted. Return the maximum number of nodes you can reach from node `0` without visiting any restricted node.

**Example:**

```markdown
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[1,2],[3,1],[4,0],[0,5],[5,6]], restricted = [4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: The diagram following the given example is:
                0
              / | \
             1  4  5
            / \    \
           2   3    6
We can visit nodes 0, 1, 2, and 3 without visiting any restricted nodes.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all edge connections bidirectional?**
   - Yes, the tree is undirected.
   
2. **What is the range of values for `n` and the sizes of `edges` and `restricted` arrays?**
   - `1 <= n <= 100,000`, and both `edges` and `restricted` arrays will be within appropriate sizes based on `n`.

3. **Can the `restricted` array contain node 0 the starting point?**
   - It should be assumed that node 0 will not be restricted, ensuring there's at least one node to start from.

## Strategy

### Steps:

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the undirected tree.
   
2. **BFS/DFS Traversal:**
   - Use a BFS or DFS traversal starting from node `0`.
   - Skip any node that is restricted.
   - Keep a visited set to avoid traversing the same node multiple times.

3. **Count Reachable Nodes:**
   - Maintain a count of nodes that can be reached.

### DFS Implementation:
- We can implement this using DFS for simplicity. Starting from node `0`, traverse using a stack and skip any node that is in the `restricted` set or already visited.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int reachableNodes(int n, int[][] edges, int[] restricted) {
        // Create the adjacency list for the graph
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            graph.get(edge[0]).add(edge[1]);
            graph.get(edge[1]).add(edge[0]);
        }

        // Convert restricted array into a set for O(1) lookup
        Set<Integer> restrictedSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (int node : restricted) {
            restrictedSet.add(node);
        }

        // Use a stack for DFS
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        Set<Integer> visited = new HashSet<>();
        stack.push(0);
        visited.add(0);
        
        int reachableCount = 0;
        
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            int node = stack.pop();
            reachableCount++;
            
            for (int neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
                if (!restrictedSet.contains(neighbor) && !visited.contains(neighbor)) {
                    stack.push(neighbor);
                    visited.add(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return reachableCount;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Building the Graph:** `O(n)`
- **DFS Traversal:** `O(n)`
- **Overall Time Complexity:** `O(n)` given we visit each node and edge once.
  
This should efficiently handle the upper constraint of `n = 100,000` nodes.
