[Leetcode 630. Course Schedule III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l630)
### Problem Statement

**630. Course Schedule III**

There are `n` different online courses numbered from `1` to `n`. You are given an array `courses` where `courses[i] = [duration_i, lastDay_i]` indicates that the `i-th` course should be taken continuously for `duration_i` days and must be finished before or on `lastDay_i`.

You will start on the `1st` day and you cannot take two or more courses simultaneously.

Return the maximum number of courses that you can take.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the courses always provided in the correct order or can the order be random?**
   - The courses can be provided in any order.

2. **Can any course take zero duration or have a last day on day 0?**
   - No, each course has a positive duration and a last day greater than zero.

3. **Is there a limit to the number of courses (n)?**
   - Constraints usually provided in LeetCode indicate that `n` can be large, up to `10,000`.

### Strategy

The approach to solving this problem is as follows:

1. **Sort the Courses by their Last Day**: 
   - This helps in ensuring that if we pick a course to maximize the number of courses, we pick the ones that need to be completed earlier.

2. **Max-Heap for Course Durations**:
   - As we add a course, if the total days exceed the given last day of any course, we should drop the course with the maximum duration to try to fit more courses.
   - Use a max-heap to keep track of the courses' durations dynamically.

3. **Iterate Through Courses**:
   - Add each course to a current timeline and if it exceeds, pop the course with the maximum duration.

### Time Complexity
- Sorting the courses will take O(n log n).
- Inserting into and popping from a max-heap will take O(log n), and we perform this operation for each course, resulting in O(n log n).
- Overall time complexity is O(n log n).

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int scheduleCourse(int[][] courses) {
        // Sort the courses by their end time.
        Arrays.sort(courses, (a, b) -> a[1] - b[1]);

        // Max heap to keep track of the courses taken.
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        int currentTime = 0;

        for (int[] course : courses) {
            int duration = course[0];
            int lastDay = course[1];
            
            if (currentTime + duration <= lastDay) {
                // If we can finish this course before its last day
                currentTime += duration;
                maxHeap.offer(duration);
            } else if (!maxHeap.isEmpty() && maxHeap.peek() > duration) {
                // Replace the longest duration course taken so far if the current course is shorter
                currentTime += duration - maxHeap.poll();
                maxHeap.offer(duration);
            }
        }

        // The size of the heap is the maximum number of courses we can take
        return maxHeap.size();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[][] courses = // use example above
        System.out.println(solution.scheduleCourse(courses));  // Output: 3
    }
}
```

This solution incorporates sorting and a max-heap to effectively manage the schedule of courses within the given constraints. The size of the heap at the end represents the maximum number of courses that can be taken.
