[Leetcode 15. 3Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l15)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return all the triplets `[nums[i], nums[j], nums[k]]` such that `i != j`, `i != k`, and `j != k`, and `nums[i] + nums[j] + nums[k] == 0`. Notice that the solution set must not contain duplicate triplets.

### Example:
```
Input: nums = [-1,0,1,2,-1,-4]
Output: [[-1,-1,2],[-1,0,1]]
```

```
Input: nums = []
Output: []
```

```
Input: nums = [0]
Output: []
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What should be returned if there are no such triplets?
   **A:** An empty list should be returned.

2. **Q:** Can the input include duplicate numbers?
   **A:** Yes, the input can contain duplicate numbers, but the solution must not contain duplicate triplets.

3. **Q:** Should the triplets be returned in any specific order?
   **A:** No, the order of the triplets does not matter.

## Strategy

To solve the 3Sum problem, we can use a two-pointer approach with sorting:

1. **Sort the Array**: First, sort the input array. This makes it easier to avoid duplicates and use the two-pointer technique.
  
2. **Iterate through the Array**: For each element in the array (with the index `i`), treat it as the first element of the triplet and use two pointers to find pairs that add up to the negative of the first element.
  
3. **Two-pointer Technique**:
   - Initialize two pointers: one starting just after `i` (`left`) and one at the end of the array (`right`).
   - Move the `left` pointer to the right and the `right` pointer to the left based on the sum of `nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right]`.
   - If the sum is zero, record the triplet and adjust both pointers, being careful to skip over duplicates.

4. **Avoid Duplicates**: Skip duplicate values both when choosing the first element of the triplet and when adjusting the two pointers.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> threeSum(int[] nums) {
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 2; i++) {
            // Skip duplicates for the first element.
            if (i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i - 1]) continue;
            
            int left = i + 1;
            int right = nums.length - 1;
            
            while (left < right) {
                int sum = nums[i] + nums[left] + nums[right];
                
                if (sum == 0) {
                    result.add(Arrays.asList(nums[i], nums[left], nums[right]));
                    
                    // Skip duplicates for the second element.
                    while (left < right && nums[left] == nums[left + 1]) left++;
                    // Skip duplicates for the third element.
                    while (left < right && nums[right] == nums[right - 1]) right--;
                    
                    left++;
                    right--;
                } else if (sum < 0) {
                    left++;
                } else {
                    right--;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting the array**: `O(n log n)`
- **Iterating through the array elements**: `O(n)`
- **Two-pointer approach for each element**: `O(n)`

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n^2)`.

- **Space Complexity**: 
   - The space complexity mainly depends on the sorting step, which typically takes `O(n)` auxiliary space if the sort implementation uses a non-in-place algorithm. However, most in-place sorts like QuickSort would use `O(log n)` auxiliary space.
   - Additionally, the output list can take up to `O(n^2)` space in the worst case if there are many triplets.
