[Leetcode 1869. Longer Contiguous Segments of Ones than Zeros](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1869)
## Problem Statement
1869. Longer Contiguous Segments of Ones than Zeros

You are given a binary string `s` that contains only characters `'0'` and `'1'`. A binary string is a string that consists only of characters `'0'` and `'1'`.

Return `true` if the longest contiguous segment of `1`s is strictly longer than the longest contiguous segment of `0`s in the binary string `s`, otherwise, return `false`.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can the string be empty?**
   - No, as we are given a binary string, it will contain at least one character.
2. **Are there constraints on the string's length?**
   - The constraint as per LeetCode is typically manageable within the context of an interview, typically up to `10^5` characters.
3. **Should the function be case-sensitive?**
   - No, as the problem specifies the string will only contain `0`s and `1`s.
4. **What should the output be if the length of the longest segment of `1`s is equal to the longest segment of `0`s?**
   - The output should be `false` as per the problem's requirement for a "strictly longer" segment of `1`s.

## Strategy
1. Traverse the binary string and keep track of the longest contiguous segment of `1`s and the longest contiguous segment of `0`s.
2. Iterate through the string while maintaining counters for consecutive `1`s and `0`s.
3. Compare the longest segment lengths and return the appropriate boolean result.

## Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean checkZeroOnes(String s) {
        int maxOnes = 0, maxZeros = 0;
        int currentOnes = 0, currentZeros = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            if (c == '1') {
                currentOnes++;
                currentZeros = 0;
                maxOnes = Math.max(maxOnes, currentOnes);
            } else {
                currentZeros++;
                currentOnes = 0;
                maxZeros = Math.max(maxZeros, currentZeros);
            }
        }
        
        return maxOnes > maxZeros;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.checkZeroOnes("1101")); // true
        System.out.println(sol.checkZeroOnes("111000")); // false
        System.out.println(sol.checkZeroOnes("110100010")); // false
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we are performing a single pass through the string.

## Explanation of Code:
1. We initialize `maxOnes` and `maxZeros` to keep track of the maximum segments of `1`s and `0`s respectively.
2. `currentOnes` and `currentZeros` are initialized to count the length of the current segments of `1`s and `0`s while iterating.
3. We iterate through each character in the string:
   - If the character is `'1'`, we increment `currentOnes`, reset `currentZeros` to 0, and update `maxOnes` if `currentOnes` is greater.
   - If the character is `'0'`, we increment `currentZeros`, reset `currentOnes` to 0, and update `maxZeros` if `currentZeros` is greater.
4. After the loop, we compare `maxOnes` with `maxZeros` and return `true` if `maxOnes` is greater, otherwise `false`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the longest contiguous segments of `1`s and `0`s and return the correct result based on the problem's requirements.
