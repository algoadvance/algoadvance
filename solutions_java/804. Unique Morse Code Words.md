[Leetcode 804. Unique Morse Code Words](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l804)
### Problem Statement

The problem states that we are given an array of words, where each word can be converted into a Morse code string based on the given mapping of each letter to a Morse code character. Our task is to determine how many different Morse code transformations we can get from the given array of words.

Each letter has a corresponding Morse code and the mapping is as follows:

```
'a' -> ".-"
'b' -> "-..."
'c' -> "-.-."
'd' -> "-.."
'e' -> "."
'f' -> "..-."
'g' -> "--."
'h' -> "...."
'i' -> ".."
'j' -> ".---"
'k' -> "-.-"
'l' -> ".-.."
'm' -> "--"
'n' -> "-."
'o' -> "---"
'p' -> ".--."
'q' -> "--.-"
'r' -> ".-."
's' -> "..."
't' -> "-"
'u' -> "..-"
'v' -> "...-"
'w' -> ".--"
'x' -> "-..-"
'y' -> "-.--"
'z' -> "--.."
```

Given words, we need to return the number of unique Morse code transformations among them.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format:**
   - **Q:** What is the format of the input?
   - **A:** The input is an array of strings, `words`.

2. **Output Format:**
   - **Q:** What is the format of the output?
   - **A:** The output is a single integer indicating the number of unique Morse code transformations.

3. **Constraints:**
   - **Q:** Are there any constraints on the length of the words or the number of words?
   - **A:** The length of a word is 1 ≤ length ≤ 12 and the number of words is 1 ≤ words.length ≤ 100.

### Strategy

1. **Data Structure:**
   - We will use a `HashSet` to keep track of unique Morse code transformations as sets inherently ignore duplicates.

2. **Algorithm:**
   - Create an array of Morse code representations for each letter.
   - Iterate over each word in the input array.
   - Convert each character of the word to its Morse code equivalent using the array.
   - Concatenate these Morse codes to form the transformation for the word.
   - Add the transformation to our HashSet.
   - Return the size of the HashSet as it would give us the count of unique transformations.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class UniqueMorseCodeWords {
    public int uniqueMorseRepresentations(String[] words) {
        // Morse code for each letter a-z
        String[] morseCodes = new String[]{
            ".-","-...","-.-.","-..",".","..-.",
            "--.","....","..",".---","-.-",".-..",
            "--","-.","---",".--.","--.-",".-.",
            "...","-","..-","...-",".--","-..-",
            "-.--","--.."
        };

        // Using a HashSet to keep track of unique morse transformations
        Set<String> uniqueTransformations = new HashSet<>();

        // Iterate through each word
        for (String word : words) {
            StringBuilder transformation = new StringBuilder();

            // Convert each character to its corresponding morse code
            for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
                transformation.append(morseCodes[c - 'a']);
            }

            // Add the transformation to the set
            uniqueTransformations.add(transformation.toString());
        }

        // The number of unique transformations
        return uniqueTransformations.size();
    }

    // Example usage
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        UniqueMorseCodeWords solution = new UniqueMorseCodeWords();
        String[] words = {"gin", "zen", "gig", "msg"};
        System.out.println(solution.uniqueMorseRepresentations(words)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Conversion of each word to Morse code:** O(L) where L is the length of the word.
- **Iterating through words:** O(N) where N is the number of words.
- **Overall Time Complexity:** O(N * L), since for each word we are doing an O(L) operation, and we have N words. Given the constraints, this should efficiently handle the input sizes specified.
