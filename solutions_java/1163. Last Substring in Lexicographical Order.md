[Leetcode 1163. Last Substring in Lexicographical Order full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1163)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return the last substring of `s` in lexicographical order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints:**
   - What is the length range of the string `s`?
     - The length of `s` will be in the range [1, 100000].
   - What type of characters does the string `s` contain?
     - The string `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.

2. **Output:**
   - Do we need to return any specific format for the substring or just the substring itself?
     - Just the substring itself.

### Strategy

To find the last substring in lexicographical order, we can make use of the following observations:
1. **Suffix Comparison:** We need to compare suffixes of the string.
2. **Efficient Approach:** Instead of generating and sorting all suffixes (which would be inefficient), we can use a two-pointer approach to find the maximum suffix in a single linear scan.

#### Algorithm
1. Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`, both set at different positions in the string, which will keep track of the starts of the current best substring and the new candidate substring.
2. Compare characters sequentially starting from these pointers.
3. Adjust the pointers based on lexicographical comparison until the end of the string is reached.

### Code

Here's the Java implementation for this approach:

```java
public class LastSubstringInLexicographicalOrder {
    public String lastSubstring(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int i = 0;
        int j = 1;
        int k = 0;

        while (j + k < n) {
            if (s.charAt(i + k) == s.charAt(j + k)) {
                k++;
            } else if (s.charAt(i + k) < s.charAt(j + k)) {
                i = Math.max(i + k + 1, j);
                j = i + 1;
                k = 0;
            } else {
                j = j + k + 1;
                k = 0;
            }
        }

        return s.substring(i);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LastSubstringInLexicographicalOrder solution = new LastSubstringInLexicographicalOrder();
        System.out.println(solution.lastSubstring("abab")); // Output: "bab"
        System.out.println(solution.lastSubstring("leetcode")); // Output: "tcode"
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This comes from the linear scan of the string with the two-pointer technique. The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a few extra variables for indices.
