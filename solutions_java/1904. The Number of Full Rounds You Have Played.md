[Leetcode 1904. The Number of Full Rounds You Have Played](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1904)
## Problem Statement
You are participating in an online game and you have finished your last game at ```finish_time``` (in "HH:MM" format). Each round of the game lasts exactly 15 minutes. The game statistics show the time you have finished the game but do not show the exact time you started.

Input:
- `start_time`: a string representing the start time in "HH:MM" format.
- `finish_time`: a string representing the finish time in "HH:MM" format.

You need to calculate the number of full game rounds (each of 15 minutes) that you have completed.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Does the game time always span within 24 hours?**
   - Yes, the start and finish times are within the same 24-hour period, but the finish time can be earlier or later than the start time.
   
2. **Are edge cases like start time equal to finish time possible?**
   - Yes, in such cases, you would have played zero full rounds.

3. **Are `start_time` and `finish_time` always in valid HH:MM format?**
   - Yes, you can assume that both times are valid and well-formatted.

## Strategy
1. **Convert Time to Minutes:**
    - Convert `start_time` and `finish_time` into minutes from the start of the day.

2. **Handle Overnight Span:**
   - If the `finish_time` is smaller than `start_time`, it implies the finish time is on the next day. We need to adjust the minutes accordingly.

3. **Round Up & Down:**
   - Adjust the `start_time` to the next quarter hour (round it up), and `finish_time` to the previous quarter hour (round it down).

4. **Calculate the Difference and Determine Full Rounds:**
   - Compute the difference between the adjusted times and divide by 15 to get the number of full rounds.

Below is the Java code implementing the strategy:

## Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int numberOfRounds(String start_time, String finish_time) {
        int startMinutes = convertToMinutes(start_time);
        int finishMinutes = convertToMinutes(finish_time);

        // Handle overnight span
        if (finishMinutes < startMinutes) {
            finishMinutes += 24 * 60;
        }

        // Round the start time up to the nearest quarter hour
        int startRounded = (startMinutes + 14) / 15 * 15;
        // Round the finish time down to the nearest quarter hour
        int finishRounded = finishMinutes / 15 * 15;

        // Calculate full rounds played
        int fullRounds = (finishRounded - startRounded) / 15;
        
        // Return the number of full 15-minute periods
        return Math.max(0, fullRounds);
    }

    private int convertToMinutes(String time) {
        String[] parts = time.split(":");
        int hours = Integer.parseInt(parts[0]);
        int minutes = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]);
        return hours * 60 + minutes;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(1)` because:
- Converting time to minutes and adjusting `start` and `finish` times involves a constant number of operations.
- Overall complexity is constant.
