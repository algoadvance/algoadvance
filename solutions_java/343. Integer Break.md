[Leetcode 343. Integer Break](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l343)
### Problem Statement
Given a positive integer `n`, break it into the sum of at least two positive integers and maximize the product of those integers. Return the maximum product you can obtain.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: 2 = 1 + 1, 1 × 1 = 1.
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 10
Output: 36
Explanation: 10 = 3 + 3 + 4, 3 × 3 × 4 = 36.
```

**Constraints:**
- `2 <= n <= 58`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `n` be 1?**
   - No, `n` starts from 2 as per constraints.
2. **Do we need to handle any special cases?**
   - Special cases involve lower values of `n` (like 2 and 3) where the breakdown is straightforward.

### Strategy
To break down the integer `n` into parts that yield the maximum product, we can use mathematical insights:
1. For integers greater than or equal to 4, breaking them into 2's and 3's yields a higher product.
2. Specifically, breaking into as many 3's as possible tends to give the optimal product, with special handling for leftovers:
   - When `n % 3 == 0`, it's optimal to break entirely into 3's.
   - When `n % 3 == 1`, it's optimal to use one 2 and then continue with 3's.
   - When `n % 3 == 2`, simply use the extra 2 along with the 3's.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int integerBreak(int n) {
        if (n == 2) return 1;
        if (n == 3) return 2;
        
        int product = 1;
        while (n > 4) {
            product *= 3;
            n -= 3;
        }
        // when n is less than or equal to 4, it can only be 2, 3 or 4
        // and it is optimal to just multiply the remaining value
        return product * n;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        // Test cases
        System.out.println(sol.integerBreak(2)); // Output: 1
        System.out.println(sol.integerBreak(10)); // Output: 36
        System.out.println(sol.integerBreak(5)); // Output: 6
        System.out.println(sol.integerBreak(6)); // Output: 9
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) in the worst case due to the while loop, but it is very efficient since it only iterates when `n` is greater than 4.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) since we are only using a few extra variables.

### Explanation
1. For `n == 2`, the only way to split is \(1+1\). Hence, the product is \(1\times1=1\).
2. For `n == 3`, the only way to split is \(2+1\). Hence, the product is \(2\times1=2\).
3. For all other `n` values:
    - We subtract 3 from `n` repeatedly (maximizing product by using as many 3’s as possible).
    - When the remaining `n` is less than or equal to 4, we multiply it with our product.

This mathematical insight ensures we maximize the product with the most efficient breakdowns.
