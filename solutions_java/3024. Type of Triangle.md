[Leetcode 3024. Type of Triangle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3024)
### Problem Statement

Given three integers representing the lengths of the sides of a triangle, determine the type of triangle they form. The possible types of triangles are:

1. **Equilateral** - All three sides have equal length.
2. **Isosceles** - Exactly two sides have equal length.
3. **Scalene** - All three sides have different lengths.
4. **Not a triangle** - The sides do not form a valid triangle.

A set of three sides (a, b, c) will form a valid triangle if:
- \( a + b > c \)
- \( b + c > a \)
- \( a + c > b \)

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Can the side lengths be zero or negative?
   - What is the range of the side lengths?

2. **Output**:
   - Should the output be a specific string indicating the type of triangle?

### Strategy

1. **Validation**:
   - First, check if the given side lengths form a valid triangle using the triangle inequality theorem.
   
2. **Classification**:
   - If valid, classify the triangle based on the side lengths:
     - If all three sides are equal, it's an Equilateral triangle.
     - If exactly two sides are equal, it's an Isosceles triangle.
     - If all three sides are different, it's a Scalene triangle.
   - If not valid, return "Not a triangle".

### Code

```java
public class TriangleType {
    public static String determineTriangleType(int a, int b, int c) {
        // Check for valid triangle using triangle inequality theorem
        if (a + b <= c || b + c <= a || a + c <= b) {
            return "Not a triangle";
        }
        
        // Determine type of triangle
        if (a == b && b == c) {
            return "Equilateral";
        } else if (a == b || b == c || a == c) {
            return "Isosceles";
        } else {
            return "Scalene";
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test cases
        System.out.println(determineTriangleType(3, 3, 3)); // Equilateral
        System.out.println(determineTriangleType(3, 4, 4)); // Isosceles
        System.out.println(determineTriangleType(3, 4, 5)); // Scalene
        System.out.println(determineTriangleType(1, 1, 2)); // Not a triangle
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \( O(1) \) since the operations performed (comparisons and equality checks) are done in constant time. There are no loops or recursive calls.

### Summary

This solution succinctly determines the type of a triangle based on its side lengths and efficiently ensures that the side lengths form a valid triangle before classification. Make sure to handle edge cases such as non-positive side lengths if necessary.
