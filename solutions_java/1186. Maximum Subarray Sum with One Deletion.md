[Leetcode 1186. Maximum Subarray Sum with One Deletion](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1186)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `arr`, return the maximum sum of a non-empty subarray containing at most one deletion. 

A subarray is a contiguous element sequence of the array.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: arr = [1,-2,0,3]
Output: 4
Explanation: Because we can choose [1, -2, 0, 3] and remove -2 to make [1, 0, 3] which has a maximum sum of 4.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: arr = [-1,-1,-1,-1]
Output: -1
Explanation: The least negative number is -1 and even removing any number will not result in a larger sum.
```

#### Constraints:
- `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= arr[i] <= 10^4`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the subarray be the entire array?
   - **A:** Yes, the subarray can span the entire array if deleting no elements or one element somewhere else results in the maximum sum.
   
2. **Q:** Can the array contain both positive and negative integers?
   - **A:** Yes, the array can contain both positive and negative integers.

3. **Q:** What should we return if the input array contains only one element?
   - **A:** Return that single element, as no deletion would be possible.

### Strategy
We can solve this problem using dynamic programming with two auxiliary arrays:

1. `dp1[i]`: Maximum subarray sum ending at index `i` without any deletion.
2. `dp2[i]`: Maximum subarray sum ending at index `i` with one deletion.

For each element `arr[i]`:
1. `dp1[i] = max(dp1[i-1] + arr[i], arr[i])`
2. `dp2[i] = max(dp2[i-1] + arr[i], dp1[i-1])`

Finally, return the maximum value from the combined `dp1` and `dp2` arrays.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maximumSum(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        if (n == 1) {
            return arr[0];
        }

        int[] dp1 = new int[n];
        int[] dp2 = new int[n];

        dp1[0] = arr[0];
        dp2[0] = arr[0];
        int maxSum = arr[0];

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dp1[i] = Math.max(dp1[i - 1] + arr[i], arr[i]);
            dp2[i] = Math.max(dp2[i - 1] + arr[i], dp1[i - 1]);
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, Math.max(dp1[i], dp2[i]));
        }

        return maxSum;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), because we iterate through the array in a single pass.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for storing the `dp1` and `dp2` arrays.

However, this space can actually be optimized to O(1) since we only need the previous element's value in the array.

### Optimized Code with Reduced Space Complexity

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maximumSum(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        if (n == 1) {
            return arr[0];
        }

        int dp1 = arr[0];
        int dp2 = arr[0];
        int maxSum = arr[0];

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int newDp1 = Math.max(dp1 + arr[i], arr[i]);
            int newDp2 = Math.max(dp2 + arr[i], dp1);
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, Math.max(newDp1, newDp2));
            dp1 = newDp1;
            dp2 = newDp2;
        }

        return maxSum;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity of Optimized Solution
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), only a few extra variables are used.

This optimized approach maintains the same time complexity but reduces space utilization significantly.
