[Leetcode 1716. Calculate Money in Leetcode Bank](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1716)
### Problem Statement

You are given a bank account where you deposit money every day. The rules for the deposits are as follows:

- On the first day, you deposit `1` dollar.
- Every day after that, the deposit amount will increase by `1` dollar until the start of the next week (7 days later). On the eighth day, the deposit will be `1` dollar again, and then it will increase by `1` dollar each day again during that week.

Given `n`, the number of days, return the total money in the bank at the end of the nth day.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are the deposits reset to `1` dollar after every 7 days?
   **A:** Yes, the deposit resets every week.

2. **Q:** Is `n` guaranteed to be a positive integer?
   **A:** Yes, `n` is a positive integer.

### Strategy

1. Initialize a variable `totalMoney` to keep track of the total amount of money.
2. Use a loop to iterate from day `1` to day `n`:
   - For each day, calculate the week number and the day of the week.
   - Determine the deposit amount using the formula: `week number + day of the week`.
   - Add the deposit amount to `totalMoney`.
3. Return the `totalMoney`.

### Code

Here is the Java implementation of the strategy:

```java
public class CalculateMoneyInBank {
    public int totalMoney(int n) {
        int totalMoney = 0; // Initialize total amount of money
        for (int day = 1; day <= n; day++) {
            int week = (day - 1) / 7; // Determine the week number
            int dayOfWeek = (day - 1) % 7; // Determine the day of the week
            totalMoney += week + dayOfWeek + 1; // Calculate deposit for the day
        }
        return totalMoney;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CalculateMoneyInBank bank = new CalculateMoneyInBank();
        System.out.println(bank.totalMoney(10)); // Example test case
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Loop through each day**: The loop runs from `1` to `n` (inclusive) where `day` is the current day.
2. **Calculate week number and day of the week**:
   - `week = (day - 1) / 7`: This gives the zero-based week number (`0` for the first week, `1` for the second week, etc.).
   - `dayOfWeek = (day - 1) % 7`: This gives the zero-based day of the week (`0` for Monday, `6` for Sunday).
3. **Calculate the deposit amount**:
   - The deposit for each day can be found using the formula `week + dayOfWeek + 1`.
4. **Accumulate the total money**:
   - Add the calculated deposit to `totalMoney`.

### Time Complexity

- The code runs a single loop from `1` to `n`, performing constant-time operations within the loop.
- Therefore, the time complexity is **O(n)**.
