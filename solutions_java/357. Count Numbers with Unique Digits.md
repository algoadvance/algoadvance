[Leetcode 357. Count Numbers with Unique Digits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l357)
## Problem Statement

Given a non-negative integer `n`, return the count of all numbers with unique digits, `x`, where `0 â‰¤ x < 10^n`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `n` be 0?**
   - Yes, `n` can be 0.
   
2. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - `n` is a non-negative integer, typically `n` <= 10 because 10^n will have more digits than can fit in a standard integer.
   
3. **What should be the output if `n` is 0?**
   - If `n` is 0, the count of numbers with unique digits is 1 (`0` itself).

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a mathematical approach rather than generating each number and checking its uniqueness. Let's break down the idea:

- If `n` is greater than 10, we can't have more than 10 unique digits because there are only 10 digits (0-9).
- For each digit length `i` from `1` to `n`, we calculate the number of unique numbers of length `i`.
- We use combinatorics to calculate the number of valid unique digit numbers of each length. We use a factorial-like approach because we need to pick unique digits in decreasing order.

**Steps:**

1. **Base Case:**
   - If `n` is 0, return 1.
   
2. **Initialization:**
   - Start by counting the one-digit numbers: there are 10 unique one-digit numbers (0 through 9).

3. **Use a loop to calculate unique digit numbers for lengths `2` to `n`:**
   - For length `2`, there are `9 * 9` possible numbers (because the first digit can't be 0).
   - For length `3`, there are `9 * 9 * 8` possible numbers (because the first digit can't be 0 and the second digit can be any of the 9 remaining digits, the third digit can be any of the 8 remaining digits).

Repeat this pattern up to `n`.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int countNumbersWithUniqueDigits(int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 1;
        int uniqueDigitsCount = 10; // For n = 1, there are 10 unique digits (0-9)
        int availableDigits = 9;
        int currentCount = 9;
        
        for (int i = 2; i <= n && availableDigits > 0; i++) {
            currentCount *= availableDigits;
            uniqueDigitsCount += currentCount;
            availableDigits--;
        }
        
        return uniqueDigitsCount;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the input number. This is because the maximum number of iterations the loop will run is `n`.

The space complexity is `O(1)` because we are using a constant amount of extra space to store the counts and the factorial-like computations.
