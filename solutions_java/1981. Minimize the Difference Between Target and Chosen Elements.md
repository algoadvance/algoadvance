[Leetcode 1981. Minimize the Difference Between Target and Chosen Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1981)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D array `mat` of dimensions `m x n` and an integer `target`. Your task is to find the smallest possible absolute difference between the target and the sum of chosen elements from each row of the `mat` array. You must choose one element from each row of the matrix to make a sum.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of elements**: What is the possible range of values for the elements in `mat`?
2. **Dimensions of the matrix**: What are the constraints on the values of `m` (number of rows) and `n` (number of columns)?
3. **Uniqueness of elements in rows**: Are elements in each row unique?
4. **Edge cases**: What are potential edge cases? For example, matrix with all the same values, etc.

### Strategy

This problem can be approached using dynamic programming. The goal is to find the minimal absolute difference between the target and the sum of chosen elements. Here's a detailed strategy:

1. **Initialization**: Use a set to track all the possible sums we can get starting from each row.
2. **Dynamic Programming Update**: For each row in the matrix:
    - For each element in the matrix row, calculate the new possible sums by adding this element to the sums already in the set from the previous rows.
    - Update the set of possible sums to only hold these new sums.
3. **Result Calculation**: After processing all rows, find the minimum absolute difference between the target and any sum in the set of possible sums.

### Code

Here is a Java implementation based on the strategy:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class Solution {
    public int minimizeTheDifference(int[][] mat, int target) {
        Set<Integer> possibleSums = new HashSet<>();
        possibleSums.add(0);

        for (int[] row : mat) {
            Set<Integer> newSums = new HashSet<>();
            for (int sum : possibleSums) {
                for (int num : row) {
                    newSums.add(sum + num);
                }
            }
            possibleSums = newSums;
        }

        int minAbsDifference = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int sum : possibleSums) {
            minAbsDifference = Math.min(minAbsDifference, Math.abs(target - sum));
        }

        return minAbsDifference;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[][] mat = // use example from above
        int target = 13;
        System.out.println(sol.minimizeTheDifference(mat, target)); // Output should be the minimal absolute difference to the target
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization and Update**: For each row, the number of possible sums increases exponentially in the worst case. Thus, the time complexity can be roughly estimated to be `O(m * n * S)` where `S` is the number of unique sums that can be formed which is bounded by the elements' range multiplied by the number of rows.
- **Result Calculation**: Iterating through all possible sums has linear complexity with respect to the size of the possible sums.

Thus, the overall complexity is heavily dependent on `S`, but due to constraints of typical problem settings on platforms like LeetCode, it is typically feasible to compute efficiently in practice.
