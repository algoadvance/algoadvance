[Leetcode 2442. Count Number of Distinct Integers After Reverse Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2442)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, you need to perform the following operations:
1. Add all elements of `nums` to a set.
2. Reverse the digits of each element in `nums` and add the resulting numbers to the set.

Return the total number of distinct integers in the set after performing the above operations.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input size**: What is the maximum size of the array `nums`?
   - Assumption: Usually the constraints are reasonable for computation within typical competitive programming limits.
   
2. **Element range**: What are the possible values of elements in `nums`?
   - Assumption: Elements are within the range of typical integers (e.g., 32-bit signed integers).

3. **Leading zeros**: How should we handle numbers with leading zeros after reversing?
   - Assumption: When reversing digits, leading zeros should be removed (e.g., reversing 120 should produce 21).

### Strategy
1. **Initialization**: Start by initializing a set to store the distinct integers.
2. **Add Original Numbers**: Add each element from the `nums` array to the set.
3. **Add Reversed Numbers**: For each element in `nums`, reverse its digits and add the reversed number to the set.
4. **Counting Distinct Elements**: The size of the set will give the count of distinct integers.

### Code
Below is the Java code implementing the above strategy:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class DistinctIntegersAfterReverse {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage:
        int[] nums = {1, 13, 45, 21};
        System.out.println(countDistinctIntegers(nums)); // Example call
    }

    public static int countDistinctIntegers(int[] nums) {
        Set<Integer> distinctIntegers = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            distinctIntegers.add(num);
            distinctIntegers.add(reverseNumber(num));
        }
        
        return distinctIntegers.size();
    }

    private static int reverseNumber(int num) {
        int reversed = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            reversed = reversed * 10 + num % 10;
            num /= 10;
        }
        return reversed;
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Data Structure**: A `HashSet` is used to store distinct integers due to its efficient O(1) average-time complexity for insertion and look-up.
2. **Reversing Digits**: The `reverseNumber` method iteratively constructs the reverse of a given integer by extracting and appending the last digit to a new integer.
3. **Processing**: The main method `countDistinctIntegers` adds each number and its reversed counterpart to the set and then returns the size of the set, which represents the count of distinct integers.

### Time Complexity
- **Insertion and Lookup in Set**: O(1) on average.
- **Reversing each Number**: O(d) where `d` is the number of digits in a number.
- **Overall Complexity**: O(n * d) where `n` is the number of elements in `nums` and `d` is the number of digits in the largest number.

This complexity is efficient for reasonable values of `n` and typical integer sizes.
