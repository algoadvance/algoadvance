[Leetcode 1979. Find Greatest Common Divisor of Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1979)
## Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 1979: "Find Greatest Common Divisor of Array" requires you to write a function that returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the smallest and largest numbers in an array of integers.

Given an integer array `nums`, return the greatest common divisor of the smallest number and largest number in `nums`.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [2,5,6,9,10]
Output: 2
Explanation: The smallest number is 2 and the largest number is 10. The greatest common divisor of 2 and 10 is 2.
```

### Constraints:
- `2 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Can we use built-in functions to calculate GCD?
   **A**: Yes, you can use built-in functions if the language provides them.
   
2. **Q**: Will the array always contain at least two elements?
   **A**: Yes, as per the constraints `2 <= nums.length`.

3. **Q**: Can elements in the array be negative?
   **A**: No, as per the constraints `1 <= nums[i]`.

## Strategy

1. **Identifying the smallest and largest elements**:
   Use the built-in Java `Collections` utility or a simple loop to find the minimum and maximum values in the array.
  
2. **Calculating the GCD**:
   Use the Euclidean algorithm to find the GCD of the smallest and largest number.
  
### Steps:
1. Traverse the array to find the smallest and largest numbers.
2. Implement the GCD function using the Euclidean algorithm.
3. Return the computed GCD.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int findGCD(int[] nums) {
        int min = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num < min) {
                min = num;
            }
            if (num > max) {
                max = num;
            }
        }

        return gcd(min, max);
    }
    
    private int gcd(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            int temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {2, 5, 6, 9, 10};
        System.out.println(sol.findGCD(nums)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Finding Min and Max**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array.
2. **GCD Calculation**: The Euclidean algorithm takes \(O(\log(\min(a, b)))\) time in the worst case.

Overall Time Complexity: \(O(n)\) + \(O(\log(\min(a, b)))\).
In this problem, the major time complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the array traversal, as it dominates the logarithmic part.

Space Complexity: \(O(1)\), as we are using a constant amount of extra space.
