[Leetcode 441. Arranging Coins](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l441)
### Problem Statement

You have `n` coins and you want to build a staircase with these coins. The staircase consists of `k` rows where the `i-th` row contains exactly `i` coins. The last row of the staircase may not be complete.

Given a number `n`, find the total number of complete rows of the staircase you can form.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: Because the 3rd row is incomplete, we return 2.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 8
Output: 3
Explanation: Because the 4th row is incomplete, we return 3.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is `n` always non-negative?**
   - Yes, `n` is always a non-negative integer.
2. **What is the maximum value of `n`?**
   - The problem does not specify, but assume it can fit within the range of a 32-bit signed integer.
3. **Should the solution handle large values of `n` efficiently?**
   - Yes, the solution should be efficient even for large values of `n`.

### Strategy

To determine the number of complete rows, we need to sum the series: 1 + 2 + 3 + ... + k. The sum of the first k natural numbers is given by the formula:

\[ S = \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \]

We need to find the maximum `k` such that:

\[ \frac{k(k + 1)}{2} \leq n \]

This optimal strategy to find `k` is to use binary search:

1. Initialize two variables `left` set to 0 and `right` set to `n`.
2. While `left` is less than or equal to `right`:
   - Compute the middle point `mid`.
   - Calculate `current = mid * (mid + 1) / 2`.
   - If `current` is equal to `n`, then return `mid`.
   - If `current` is less than `n`, move the `left` boundary to `mid + 1`.
   - If `current` is greater than `n`, move the `right` boundary to `mid - 1`.
3. Return `right`.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int arrangeCoins(int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 0; // Edge case for n = 0
        int left = 0, right = n;
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (left - right) / 2;
            long current = (long) mid * (mid + 1) / 2;

            if (current == n) {
                return mid;
            } else if (current < n) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return right;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.arrangeCoins(5)); // Output: 2
        System.out.println(solution.arrangeCoins(8)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The binary search reduces the problem size by half at each step, making the time complexity O(log n).
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is O(1) because we are using a constant amount of extra space.
