[Leetcode 1328. Break a Palindrome](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1328)
### Problem Statement
Given a palindromic string `palindrome` of lowercase English letters, replace **exactly one** character with any lowercase English letter so that the resulting string is **not** a palindrome and that it is the **lexicographically smallest one** possible.

Return the resulting string. If there is no way to replace a character to make it not a palindrome, return an empty string.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: palindrome = "abccba"
Output: "aaccba"
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: palindrome = "a"
Output: ""
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the definition of lexicographically smallest?**
   - A string A is lexicographically smaller than a string B if at the first position where they differ, string A has a letter that appears earlier in the alphabet than the corresponding letter in string B.
2. **Can the input string contain any character other than lowercase English letters?**
   - No, the input string consists of lowercase English letters only.
3. **Is the input string always guaranteed to be a palindrome?**
   - Yes, according to the problem statement, the input will always be a palindrome.
4. **What is the maximum length of the input string?**
   - The length of the input string will not exceed 1000 characters.

### Strategy
1. **Single Character Edge Case:**
   - If the length of the palindrome is 1, it's not possible to form a non-palindrome string by replacing any single character. Therefore, return an empty string.

2. **General Case:**
   - Iterate through the first half of the palindrome (since it is symmetric).
   - Attempt to replace the first non-'a' character with 'a' to ensure the smallest lexicographically string.
   - If we find a character that is not 'a', replace it with 'a', and return the string.
   - If all characters in the first half are 'a', change the last character to 'b' to make the string non-palindromic.

### Code
Here's the implementation in Java:

```java
class Solution {
    public String breakPalindrome(String palindrome) {
        int n = palindrome.length();
        
        // If the palindrome has only one character, we can't make it non-palindromic
        if (n == 1) {
            return "";
        }

        char[] chars = palindrome.toCharArray();
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {  // Only need to iterate half the string
            if (chars[i] != 'a') {
                chars[i] = 'a';
                return new String(chars);
            }
        }

        // All characters in the first half are 'a', change the last character to 'b'
        chars[n - 1] = 'b';
        return new String(chars);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we may need to iterate through the first half of the string to find the first non-'a' character.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is due to the additional character array created to modify the string.
