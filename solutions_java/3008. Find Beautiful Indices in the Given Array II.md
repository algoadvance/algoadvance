[Leetcode 3008. Find Beautiful Indices in the Given Array II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3008)
## Problem Statement

Suppose you are given an array of integers. A "beautiful index" `i` in the array is defined as one that satisfies the following condition:

- All elements before the index `i` (excluding `i` itself) are less than the element at index `i`.

Return all the beautiful indices sorted in ascending order. If there are no such indices, return an empty list.

### Example
```
Input: arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

Input: arr = [5, 4, 3, 2, 1]
Output: []

Input: arr = [2, 3, 1, 5, 4]
Output: [1, 3]
```

### Constraints
1. `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
2. `-10^6 <= arr[i] <= 10^6`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Unique Elements:** Are all elements in the array guaranteed to be unique?
    - This is not mentioned explicitly in the problem statement.
    
2. **Indexing:** Is the array zero-indexed?
    - Yes, as per standard array conventions in most programming languages including Java, the input array is zero-indexed.

## Strategy

1. Iterate through the array from the beginning to identify the beautiful indices.
2. Track the maximum value seen so far as we iterate through the list.
3. An index `i` is beautiful if the element at index `i` is greater than the maximum value seen before it.
4. If `i` meets the condition, add `i` to the result list.

## Time Complexity
- **Time complexity:** O(n) because we are making a single pass through the array.
- **Space complexity:** O(n) in the worst case, where all indices are beautiful, and we store all of them in the result list.

## Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class BeautifulIndices {
    public static List<Integer> findBeautifulIndices(int[] arr) {
        List<Integer> beautifulIndices = new ArrayList<>();
        if (arr.length == 0) return beautifulIndices;
        
        int maxSoFar = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > maxSoFar) {
                beautifulIndices.add(i);
                maxSoFar = arr[i];
            }
        }
        
        return beautifulIndices;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int[] arr2 = {5, 4, 3, 2, 1};
        int[] arr3 = {2, 3, 1, 5, 4};

        System.out.println(findBeautifulIndices(arr1)); // Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
        System.out.println(findBeautifulIndices(arr2)); // Output: []
        System.out.println(findBeautifulIndices(arr3)); // Output: [0, 1, 3]
    }
}
```

This approach ensures that we efficiently find and return all the beautiful indices in a single pass through the array, making it both time and space efficient.
