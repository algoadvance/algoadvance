[Leetcode 2304. Minimum Path Cost in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2304)
## Problem Statement

The problem "2304. Minimum Path Cost in a Grid" from LeetCode is described as follows: 

Given a `rows x cols` integer matrix `grid` consisting of numbers, and an integer matrix `moveCost` of size `(rows * cols) x cols` where `moveCost[i][j]` represents the cost of moving from the cell with value `i` to the `j-th` column in the next row, find the minimum path cost in `grid`. 

The path cost is defined as the sum of values of the cells visited and the cost of moving through these cells, starting from any cell in the first row and moving to the cells in the last row, stepping to the next row at each step.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Number of rows and columns limitations:** Are there any constraints on the sizes of the rows and columns of the `grid`?
2. **Values in `grid` and `moveCost`:** What are the ranges of values in the grid and moveCost matrices?
3. **Avoid negative costs:** Are there any negative costs involved, or are all the costs guaranteed to be non-negative?

## Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach:**
   - We will utilize a DP table where `dp[i][j]` will store the minimum path cost to reach cell (i,j).
   - Initialize the first row of the `DP` table with the values of the first row of the grid.
   - Iterate from the second row to the last row. For each cell in the new row, compute the minimum cost to reach it from any cell in the previous row while considering the corresponding move costs.
   - The answer will be the minimum value in the last row of the DP table.

2. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Construct a DP table of the same dimensions as the grid.
   - Initialize the first row of the DP table.
   - Fill in the remaining rows by calculating the cost to move from each cell of the previous row.
   - Return the minimum value from the last row of the DP table.

3. **Time Complexity:**
   - We have a grid of size `rows x cols` and for each cell, we may need to check all possible moves which will involve iterating over `cols` columns. Hence, the time complexity should be `O(rows * cols^2)`.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minPathCost(int[][] grid, int[][] moveCost) {
        int rows = grid.length;
        int cols = grid[0].length;
        
        // DP table initialization
        int[][] dp = new int[rows][cols];
        
        // Initialize the first row of DP table with the first row of the grid
        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = grid[0][j];
        }
        
        // Fill the DP table
        for (int i = 1; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                // Find the minimum cost to reach dp[i][j]
                dp[i][j] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
                for (int k = 0; k < cols; k++) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][k] + grid[i][j] + moveCost[grid[i-1][k]][j]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Find the minimum cost in the last row
        int minCost = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            minCost = Math.min(minCost, dp[rows-1][j]);
        }
        
        return minCost;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: Fill the first row of the DP table with the values of the grid's first row.
2. **DP Table Filling**: For each cell in row `i`, iterate over all cells in the row `i-1`, calculate the possible cost to reach the current cell and update the DP table.
3. **Result Extraction**: The minimum value in the last row of the DP table gives the desired minimum path cost.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is `O(rows * cols^2)` due to double iteration over columns for every cell when filling in the DP table.
