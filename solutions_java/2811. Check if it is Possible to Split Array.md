[Leetcode 2811. Check if it is Possible to Split Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2811)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `m`. Your goal is to check if it is possible to split the array into exactly `m` non-empty subarrays such that the sum of the elements in each subarray is at most `n`. Return `true` if such a split is possible, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the elements of the array be negative?
2. Can the elements be zero?
3. What is the minimum and maximum possible length of the array `nums`?
4. Are there any constraints on the values of `m` relative to `n`?

Assuming the elements of `nums` are non-negative, letâ€™s proceed with the problem.

## Strategy

We can approach this problem using binary search combined with greedy checking. The idea is to find the minimum possible value for the largest sum among the subarrays.

### Steps:

1. **Define the Search Space**: 
    - The minimum possible sum for any subarray is the maximum element in `nums` (since we cannot create a subarray smaller than any single element).
    - The maximum possible sum is the total sum of the array (if we don't split the array at all).

2. **Binary Search for the Optimum Value**:
    - Perform binary search within the range defined above.
    - For each mid-value during the binary search, check if it is possible to split the array such that no subarray has a sum greater than `mid`.

3. **Greedy Check for Splitting**:
    - Use a greedy approach to count the number of subarrays needed for a given maximum sum `mid`.
    - If the count of subarrays is less than or equal to `m`, it means it's possible to split the array with the current `mid` value. Otherwise, it's not possible.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {

    public boolean canSplitArray(int[] nums, int m, int targetSum) {
        int currSum = 0;
        int subarrayCount = 1;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (currSum + num > targetSum) {
                subarrayCount++;
                currSum = num;
                if (subarrayCount > m) {
                    return false;
                }
            } else {
                currSum += num;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }

    public boolean splitArray(int[] nums, int m) {
        int maxElement = 0;
        int totalSum = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            maxElement = Math.max(maxElement, num);
            totalSum += num;
        }
        
        int left = maxElement;
        int right = totalSum;
        
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            
            if (canSplitArray(nums, m, mid)) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return canSplitArray(nums, m, left);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {7, 2, 5, 10, 8};
        int m = 2;
        System.out.println(sol.splitArray(nums, m)); // Output: true
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Binary Search Complexity**: O(log(S)) where S is the sum of the array elements.
- **Greedy Checking for each Binary Search Step**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array.

Hence, the total time complexity is:
\[ O(n \cdot \log(S)) \]

This is quite efficient given the constraints typically found in coding interview problems.
