[Leetcode 900. RLE Iterator](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l900)
### Problem Statement

Let's say you have a run-length encoded sequence, where each element in the array represents `[count, value]` pairs. For example, the sequence `[3, 8, 0, 9, 2, 5]` translates to `8, 8, 8, 5, 5`. 

Implement an iterator to decode the run-length encoded sequence:
- `RLEIterator(int[] A)`: Initializes the object with an array `A`.
- `int next(int n)`: Exhausts the next `n` elements and returns the last element exhausted in this way. If there is no element to be exhausted, return `-1`.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: ["RLEIterator", "next", "next", "next", "next"]
[[[3,8,0,9,2,5]], [2], [1], [1], [2]]
Output: [null, 8, 8, 5, -1]
Explanation: 
RLEIterator rLEIterator = new RLEIterator([3,8,0,9,2,5]);
rLEIterator.next(2); // exhausts 2 terms and returns 8
rLEIterator.next(1); // exhausts 1 term and returns 8
rLEIterator.next(1); // exhausts 1 term and returns 5
rLEIterator.next(2); // exhausts 2 terms and returns -1
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Array Structure:** Will the input array always be well-formed (even length, non-negative counts)?
   - Yes, the input array will always have non-negative counts and will have an even length.
2. **Constraints on Array Size and Values:**
   - The size of `A` and the maximum values of counts and elements will be within reasonable limits as typically expected in competitive programming.
3. **Thread Safety:** Is the class expected to be thread-safe?
   - No, thread safety is not a concern in this context.

### Strategy

We can maintain a pointer or index to track the current `[count, value]` pair from the input array. The main operations will be:
1. Reducing the count as we call `next(int n)`.
2. Moving to the next `[count, value]` pair when the current count is exhausted.
3. Returning the correct value or `-1` when elements are exhausted.

### Code

```java
public class RLEIterator {
    private int[] encoding;
    private int index;
    private int remainingCount;

    public RLEIterator(int[] A) {
        this.encoding = A;
        this.index = 0;
        this.remainingCount = this.encoding.length == 0 ? 0 : this.encoding[0];
    }

    public int next(int n) {
        while (n > 0 && this.index < this.encoding.length) {
            if (n > this.remainingCount) {
                n -= this.remainingCount;
                this.index += 2;
                if (this.index < this.encoding.length) {
                    this.remainingCount = this.encoding[this.index];
                } else {
                    return -1;
                }
            } else {
                this.remainingCount -= n;
                return this.encoding[this.index + 1];
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- `RLEIterator(int[] A)`: O(1) — Initializing the object.
- `int next(int n)`: O(k) — In the worst case, we might have to traverse through all the `k` elements of `A`. 
  - If the `RLEIterator` exhausts multiple sections of `count` pairs, the operation complexity grows with the number of sections exhausted.
