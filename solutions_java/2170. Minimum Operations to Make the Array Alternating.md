[Leetcode 2170. Minimum Operations to Make the Array Alternating](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2170)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed array `nums` consisting of `n` positive integers. The array `nums` is called alternating if:

- `nums[i-1] != nums[i]` for all `i` where `1 <= i < n`.

In one operation, you can choose any index `i` and change `nums[i]` to any positive integer.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make the array alternating.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on the Array**:
    - What is the range of values `n` can take?
    - What is the range of values the elements in `nums` can take?

   **Response**: 
   - `n` is in range `[1, 10^5]`.
   - Each `nums[i]` is a positive integer and less than or equal to `10^5`.

2. **Edge Cases**:
    - What if the array already satisfies the alternating property?
    - What should we return if the array is already alternating?

   **Response**:
   - If the array is already alternating, return `0`.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Frequency**:
    - Compute the frequency of numbers at odd indices and even indices.

2. **Find Most Frequent Elements**:
    - Find the most frequent element in the odd index positions and its frequency.
    - Find the most frequent element in the even index positions and its frequency.

3. **Evaluate Minimum Operations**:
    - If the most frequent elements in odd and even indices are different, the operations required would be to change all except the most frequent elements.
    - If the most frequent elements are the same, consider the next most frequent elements for either odd or even slots and compute the minimum operations required.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int minimumOperations(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        if (n == 1) return 0;

        Map<Integer, Integer> oddFreq = new HashMap<>();
        Map<Integer, Integer> evenFreq = new HashMap<>();

        // Calculate frequencies of elements at odd and even indices
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                evenFreq.put(nums[i], evenFreq.getOrDefault(nums[i], 0) + 1);
            } else {
                oddFreq.put(nums[i], oddFreq.getOrDefault(nums[i], 0) + 1);
            }
        }

        // Find the most frequent element and their counts
        int[] oddTopTwo = getTwoMostFrequent(oddFreq);
        int[] evenTopTwo = getTwoMostFrequent(evenFreq);

        // If the most frequent elements are different, the operations are minimized directly
        // Else, we consider the best combinations between top elements of odd and even frequencies
        if (oddTopTwo[0] != evenTopTwo[0]) {
            return n - oddTopTwo[1] - evenTopTwo[1];
        } else {
            int change1 = n - oddTopTwo[1] - evenTopTwo[3];
            int change2 = n - oddTopTwo[3] - evenTopTwo[1];
            return Math.min(change1, change2);
        }
    }

    private int[] getTwoMostFrequent(Map<Integer, Integer> freq) {
        int firstNum = 0, secondNum = 0;
        int firstFreq = 0, secondFreq = 0;
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : freq.entrySet()) {
            int num = entry.getKey();
            int count = entry.getValue();
            if (count > firstFreq) {
                secondNum = firstNum;
                secondFreq = firstFreq;
                firstNum = num;
                firstFreq = count;
            } else if (count > secondFreq) {
                secondNum = num;
                secondFreq = count;
            }
        }
        return new int[]{firstNum, firstFreq, secondNum, secondFreq};
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing Frequencies**: O(n)
- **Finding Most Frequent Elements**: Using a single scan over the frequency map `O(n)`.

Thus, the entire approach operates in linear time relative to the input size, making the time complexity **O(n)**.
