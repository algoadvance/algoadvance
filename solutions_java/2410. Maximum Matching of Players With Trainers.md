[Leetcode 2410. Maximum Matching of Players With Trainers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2410)
## Problem Statement
You are given two integer arrays `players` and `trainers` representing the skill levels of players and trainers respectively. Each player can be assigned to at most one trainer and each trainer can be assigned to at most one player. A player can only be matched with a trainer if the player's skill level is less than or equal to the trainer's skill level. Return the maximum number of matchings between players and trainers.

**Example:**
```
Input: players = [4,7,9], trainers = [8,2,5,8]
Output: 2
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are the arrays `players` and `trainers` guaranteed to be non-empty?
   - Yes, to ensure meaningful matchings, both arrays have at least one element.

2. Can we modify the input arrays?
   - Yes, modifying the arrays for sorting or other operations is allowed.

3. Should we consider duplicate skill levels in the `players` or `trainers` arrays?
   - Yes, duplicate skill levels are possible and should be handled appropriately.

## Strategy
1. Sort both arrays, `players` and `trainers`. Sorting helps in efficiently finding the smallest trainer who can match a player.
2. Use a two-pointer technique to iterate through both arrays and find the maximum number of matchings:
   - Initialize two pointers: one for the `players` array and one for the `trainers` array.
   - Traverse through both arrays and match the current player with the current trainer if the player's skill is less than or equal to the trainer's skill.
   - Move the pointer for the matched trainer and player, and count this as a successful match.
   - If the player cannot be matched with the current trainer, just move the trainer's pointer to the next one.

## Code
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int matchPlayersAndTrainers(int[] players, int[] trainers) {
        Arrays.sort(players);
        Arrays.sort(trainers);
        
        int i = 0; // Pointer for players
        int j = 0; // Pointer for trainers
        int count = 0; // Number of successful matchings
        
        while (i < players.length && j < trainers.length) {
            if (players[i] <= trainers[j]) {
                // Successful match
                count++;
                i++;
                j++;
            } else {
                // Move to the next trainer
                j++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- Sorting both `players` and `trainers` takes `O(n log n)` and `O(m log m)` respectively, where `n` is the length of the `players` array and `m` is the length of the `trainers` array.
- The two-pointer traversal is `O(n + m)` since each pointer moves at most `n` or `m` steps.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n + m log m)` due to the sorting steps.
