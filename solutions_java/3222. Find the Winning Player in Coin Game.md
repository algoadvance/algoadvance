[Leetcode 3222. Find the Winning Player in Coin Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3222)
## Problem Statement

Two players are playing a game with `n` coins. The players take turns alternately, and each player must take at least 1 coin but not more than `k` coins on their turn. The player who takes the last coin wins the game.

Given the number of coins `n` and the maximum number of coins a player can take on their turn `k`, determine who the winning player is if both players play optimally, assuming that Player 1 always starts the game.

Return `true` if Player 1 can guarantee a win, and `false` if Player 2 can guarantee a win.

### Example
1. **Input:** `n = 4, k = 2`
   **Output:** `true`

2. **Input:** `n = 5, k = 2`
   **Output:** `false`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: What happens if `n` or `k` is zero or negative?**
   * A: Invalid input. n and k are always positive integers.

2. **Q: What is the maximum value for `n` and `k`?**
   * A: Assume the values of `n` and `k` can be up to 10^6.

3. **Q: If `k >= n`, is the winner immediately determined?**
   * A: Yes, Player 1 can take all the coins and win if `k >= n`.

## Strategy
We will use dynamic programming to determine the winning strategy:
1. Create a boolean array `dp` where `dp[i]` indicates whether Player 1 can guarantee a win with `i` coins remaining.
2. If `i <= k`, `dp[i]` is `true` because Player 1 can take all `i` coins and win.
3. For `i > k`, `dp[i]` will be `true` if there exists an `x` (1 <= x <= k) such that `dp[i - x]` is `false`. This means Player 1 can leave Player 2 in a losing position after Player 1 takes `x` coins.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is O(n * k), where we iterate over the `dp` array up to `n` and, for each position `i`, potentially check up to `k` values.

## Code

```java
public class CoinGame {
    public boolean canPlayerOneWin(int n, int k) {
        if (k >= n) {
            return true;
        }
        
        boolean[] dp = new boolean[n + 1];
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
                if (i - j >= 0 && !dp[i - j]) {
                    dp[i] = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CoinGame game = new CoinGame();
        
        // Test cases
        System.out.println(game.canPlayerOneWin(4, 2)); // true
        System.out.println(game.canPlayerOneWin(5, 2)); // false
    }
}
```

This code sets up the problem using dynamic programming. The boolean array `dp` is used to store the result for each number of coins from 0 to `n`. The nested loops populate this array based on the conditions defined. When the program runs, it outputs whether Player 1 can secure a win with optimal play for the given `n` and `k`.
