[Leetcode 1092. Shortest Common Supersequence ](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1092)
## Problem Statement

The problem statement for "Shortest Common Supersequence" is as follows:

Given two strings `str1` and `str2`, return the shortest string that has both `str1` and `str2` as subsequences. If there are multiple valid strings, return any of them.

A string `s` is a subsequence of a string `t` if deleting some number of characters from `t` (possibly zero) results in the string `s`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: str1 = "abac", str2 = "cab"
Output: "cabac"
Explanation: 
"cabac" is the shortest common supersequence of "abac" and "cab".
"abac" is a subsequence of "cabac".
"cab" is a subsequence of "cabac".
The no other string of length 5 or smaller is a common supersequence.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: str1 = "aaaa", str2 = "bb"
Output: "aabba"
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the lengths of the input strings?**
   - The lengths can range from 1 to 1000.

2. **What is the character set of the strings?**
   - The strings consist of lowercase English letters only.

3. **Should the solution optimize for time or space?**
   - Preferably balance time and space, but leaning towards time efficiency would be beneficial.

## Strategy

1. **Find the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS):**
   - First, we find the Longest Common Subsequence (LCS) of the two given strings. This helps in understanding the minimal overlap between the two strings.

2. **Construct the Shortest Common Supersequence (SCS):**
   - Use the LCS to build the SCS. While constructing the SCS, we include characters from both strings while ensuring we do not omit any character from either string outside of the LCS.
   - Traverse both strings using two pointers while building the resulting string.

## Code

```java
public class ShortestCommonSupersequence {
    public String shortestCommonSupersequence(String str1, String str2) {
        int m = str1.length();
        int n = str2.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];

        // Compute the length of LCS using dynamic programming
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                if (str1.charAt(i - 1) == str2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        // Build the shortest common supersequence
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        int i = m, j = n;
        while (i > 0 && j > 0) {
            if (str1.charAt(i - 1) == str2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                sb.append(str1.charAt(i - 1));
                i--;
                j--;
            } else if (dp[i - 1][j] > dp[i][j - 1]) {
                sb.append(str1.charAt(i - 1));
                i--;
            } else {
                sb.append(str2.charAt(j - 1));
                j--;
            }
        }

        // Add remaining characters of str1 and str2
        while (i > 0) {
            sb.append(str1.charAt(i - 1));
            i--;
        }
        while (j > 0) {
            sb.append(str2.charAt(j - 1));
            j--;
        }

        return sb.reverse().toString();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ShortestCommonSupersequence scs = new ShortestCommonSupersequence();
        System.out.println(scs.shortestCommonSupersequence("abac", "cab")); // Output: "cabac"
        System.out.println(scs.shortestCommonSupersequence("aaaa", "bb"));  // Output: "aabba"
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **LCS Calculation:** O(m * n)
2. **SCS Construction:** O(m + n)

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(m * n)**. The space complexity is also **O(m * n)** due to the DP table used in LCS calculation.
