[Leetcode 1375. Number of Times Binary String Is Prefix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1375)
### Problem Statement

Given a binary string `s` of `"0"` and `"1"`, you are allowed to "flip" any `0` to `1` at each step. When flipping a `0`, all the leading `1`s before it in the string should still be `1`. Calculate the number of times the binary string is prefix-aligned. A binary string is prefix-aligned if for every '1' in the string `s`, all preceding characters are also '1'.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the exact definition of "flip"?**
   - Flipping a `0` means changing it to `1`.

2. **What is meant by "prefix-aligned"?**
   - A binary string is prefix-aligned at index `i` if for all `j <= i`, the `j`-th character is `1`.

3. **Can you give an example?**
   - Input: s = "1101"
     Output: 3
   
   Explanation: 
   - At step 1: "1"  -> Prefix-aligned.
   - At step 2: "11" -> Prefix-aligned.
   - At step 3: "110" -> Not prefix-aligned.
   - At step 4: "1101" -> Prefix-aligned.

### Strategy

1. **Track the Expected Value:**
   - Maintain an `expected` value which starts at 1. This represents the number we expect to see in the string in order to say it's prefix-aligned.

2. **Iterate Through Characters:**
   - For each `i` where character `s[i] == '1'`, check if all previous characters are `1`.

3. **Update Expected Value:**
   - Whenever a '1' is seen, increment the `expected` value.
   - Count the increments to determine the number times the binary string is prefix-aligned.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int numTimesAllBlue(String lights) {
        int rightMostOn = 0;
        int count = 0;
        
        for(int i = 0; i < lights.length(); i++) {
            if (lights.charAt(i) == '1') {
                rightMostOn = Math.max(rightMostOn, i + 1);
            }
            if (rightMostOn == i + 1) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity for this solution is O(n), where `n` is the length of the binary string `s`. This is because we are iterating through the string once and performing constant-time operations within the loop.
