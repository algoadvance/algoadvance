[Leetcode 2646. Minimize the Total Price of the Trips](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2646)
## Problem Statement
You are given a tree (an undirected graph with no cycles and connected) containing `n` nodes numbered from `0 to n - 1` and exactly `n - 1` edges.

Each node has a price which is represented by an array `price` where `price[i]` is the price of the `i-th` node.

You are also given a 2D array `trips` where `trips[j] = [start_j, end_j]` indicates that you have to start at the node `start_j` and travel to the node `end_j` to complete the j-th trip.

While you travel through a node you must pay the price of the node.

The total price of all trips is the sum of the prices of all nodes visited during all trips and you can only reduce the price of **at most** one node by half.

Return the minimum total price of all trips.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can we assume that the graph is always connected and has no cycles (i.e., it's a valid tree)?
2. Are there any constraints on the size of the tree (number of nodes) and the number of trips?

Assuming the number of nodes `n` is up to `10^4` and the number of trips is also relatively large but feasible within a reasonable computational limit.

## Strategy
1. **Graph Representation and DFS**: Represent the tree using an adjacency list and perform a DFS to find all paths between the start and end nodes for each trip. Use a recursive DFS to accumulate the nodes visited for each trip.
2. **Trip Simulation**: Simulate all trips, counting the frequency of each node being visited.
3. **Optimization with DP**: Use a dynamic programming approach to decide the optimal node to halve the price. Use a bottom-up approach on the tree to decide the minimum price considering halving a node's price versus not halving it.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MinimizeTotalPrice {
    // Function to get all paths between two nodes using DFS
    private void getAllPaths(int curr, int end, List<Integer> path, List<List<Integer>> paths, boolean[] visited, List<Integer>[] graph) {
        if (curr == end) {
            paths.add(new ArrayList<>(path));
            return;
        }
        visited[curr] = true;
        for (int neighbor : graph[curr]) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                path.add(neighbor);
                getAllPaths(neighbor, end, path, paths, visited, graph);
                path.remove(path.size() - 1); // Backtracking
            }
        }
        visited[curr] = false;
    }
    
    // Dynamic Programming function to determine the minimum total price
    private int[] dp(int node, int parent, int[] count, int[] price, List<Integer>[] graph) {
        int notHalved = count[node] * price[node];
        int halved = notHalved / 2;
        for (int neighbor : graph[node]) {
            if (neighbor != parent) {
                int[] res = dp(neighbor, node, count, price, graph);
                notHalved += Math.min(res[0], res[1]); // If current node is not halved
                halved += res[0]; // If current node is halved
            }
        }
        return new int[]{notHalved, halved};
    }
    
    public int minimizeTotalPrice(int n, int[] price, int[][] edges, int[][] trips) {
        List<Integer>[] graph = new ArrayList[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            graph[edge[0]].add(edge[1]);
            graph[edge[1]].add(edge[0]);
        }
        
        // Count frequency of each node in all trips
        int[] count = new int[n];
        for (int[] trip : trips) {
            List<List<Integer>> paths = new ArrayList<>();
            boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
            List<Integer> path = new ArrayList<>();
            path.add(trip[0]);
            getAllPaths(trip[0], trip[1], path, paths, visited, graph);
            for (List<Integer> p : paths) {
                for (int node : p) {
                    count[node]++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        int[] result = dp(0, -1, count, price, graph);
        return Math.min(result[0], result[1]);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimizeTotalPrice minimizeTotalPrice = new MinimizeTotalPrice();
        int n = 3;
        int[] price = {10, 5, 4};
        int[][] edges = // use example from above
        int[][] trips = // use example from above
        System.out.println(minimizeTotalPrice.minimizeTotalPrice(n, price, edges, trips));  // Output: 23
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Graph Representation and DFS**: Each trip involves a DFS, and in the worst case, every DFS could visit all nodes `O(n)`. If `m` is the number of trips, then this part is `O(m * n)`.
2. **Dynamic Programming Optimization**: The DP recursion visits each node and its children once, resulting in `O(n)` time.

Overall Complexity: `O(m * n + n)` which simplifies to `O(m * n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes and `m` is the number of trips. This is feasible given typical constraints.
