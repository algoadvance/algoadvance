[Leetcode 1925. Count Square Sum Triples](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1925)
### Problem Statement:
Given a positive integer `n`, you need to return the number of triplets `(a, b, c)` such that:

1. `1 <= a, b, c <= n`
2. `a^2 + b^2 = c^2`

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Should the triplets `(a, b, c)` be unique, meaning `(a, b, c)` is considered the same as `(b, a, c)`?
   - Typically, in most problems the order of `(a, b)` doesnâ€™t matter unless otherwise stated.
2. Do `a`, `b`, and `c` need to be distinct?
   - Based on the typical phrasing of such problems, `a` and `b` are usually allowed to be the same, but we should confirm to avoid ambiguity.

### Strategy:
To solve the problem, we can iterate through all possible values of `a` and `b` within the range `[1, n]`, and then check if `c = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)` (where `c` also needs to be an integer and within the range). If `c` falls within the range `[1, n]`, then `(a, b, c)` is a valid triplet.

### Code:
Here is a possible implementation in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int countTriples(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int a = 1; a <= n; a++) {
            for (int b = 1; b <= n; b++) {
                int cSquared = a * a + b * b;
                int c = (int) Math.sqrt(cSquared);
                // Check if c is an integer and within the range [1, n]
                if (c <= n && c * c == cSquared) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

### Strategy Explanation:
1. **Iteration through Possible `a` and `b`**:
   - Use nested loops to iterate over all pairs `(a, b)` such that both `a` and `b` lie within `[1, n]`.
2. **Square Sum Calculation and Verification**:
   - Calculate `cSquared` as `a^2 + b^2`.
   - Compute `c` as the integer square root of `cSquared`.
   - Verify if `c` squared is equal to `cSquared` and if `c` lies within `[1, n]`.
   - If these conditions are met, increment the count.

### Time Complexity:
1. **Nested Loop Complexity**:
   - The time complexity of the nested loops (for `a` and `b`) is `O(n^2)`.
2. **Square Root Calculation**:
   - `Math.sqrt` is `O(1)` since it operates in constant time.
3. **Final Complexity**:
   - Overall, the solution runs in `O(n^2)` time.

This solution is efficient enough for the given constraints of the problem.
