[Leetcode 2558. Take Gifts From the Richest Pile](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2558)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `gifts` where each element represents the number of gifts in a pile. You are also given an integer `k`. You must take gifts from the richest pile (the pile with the maximum number of gifts) for `k` turns. In each turn, you take `floor(sqrt(max(gifts)))` gifts from that pile and leave the rest in the pile. This action continues for `k` turns. Return the total number of gifts remaining after `k` turns.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are all elements in the `gifts` array positive integers?
   - Yes, every pile will have a positive integer number of gifts.
   
2. What if there are multiple piles with the same maximum number of gifts?
   - We can choose any one of those piles.

3. Can `k` be larger than the length of the `gifts` array?
   - Yes, but `k` is the number of turns to perform the operation and is not directly related to the number of piles.

4. What should the function return if `k` is zero?
   - It should return the sum of the gifts across all piles, as no operations are performed.

## Strategy

1. Use a priority queue (max-heap) to efficiently get the pile with the maximum number of gifts.
2. For each turn (up to `k`):
   - Extract the maximum element from the heap.
   - Calculate the number of gifts to take using `floor(sqrt(max_gifts))`.
   - Subtract the number of taken gifts from the maximum element.
   - Push the remaining gifts back into the heap.
3. After `k` turns, sum all the remaining elements in the heap to get the total number of gifts left.

## Code
```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;
import java.util.Collections;

public class Solution {
    public long remainingGifts(int[] gifts, int k) {
        // Max-Heap for storing the gifts piles
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        
        // Add all gifts to the heap
        for (int gift : gifts) {
            maxHeap.add(gift);
        }
        
        // Perform k operations
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            if (maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
                break;
            }
            int maxGifts = maxHeap.poll();
            int giftsTaken = (int) Math.floor(Math.sqrt(maxGifts));
            int remainingGifts = maxGifts - giftsTaken;
            maxHeap.add(remainingGifts);
        }
        
        // Calculate the total remaining gifts
        long totalRemainingGifts = 0;
        while (!maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
            totalRemainingGifts += maxHeap.poll();
        }
        
        return totalRemainingGifts;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Heap Operations**: Each insertion or removal operation in a priority queue (max-heap) takes O(log n) time.
- **Total Complexity**: We process `k` turns, each requiring a removal and an insertion operation, leading to a time complexity of O(k log n), where `n` is the number of piles.
- **Final Summation**: Summing the remaining heap elements will take O(n), but this is dominated by the heap operations time complexity.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(k log n).
