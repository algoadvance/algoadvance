[Leetcode 1615. Maximal Network Rank](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1615)
### Problem Statement

The problem statement for Leetcode 1615, *Maximal Network Rank*, is as follows:

You are given an integer `n`, which denotes the number of cities labeled from `0` to `n-1`, and an array `roads` where `roads[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities `a_i` and `b_i`.

The **network rank** of two different cities is defined as the total number of roads that are connected to either of the two cities. If a road is connected to both cities, it is only counted once.

Return the **maximal network rank** of any two different cities.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the constraints on the number of cities (`n`)?
   - What are the constraints on the number of roads?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - Are there any cases where there might be no roads?
   - Can `n` be zero or close to zero?

**Assumptions based on typical problem constraints:**
- `2 <= n <= 100`
- `0 <= roads.length <= n*(n-1)/2`
- Since the problem deals with undirected roads, `roads[i]` will contain two different cities.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. **Initialize Data Structures:**
   - Use an array `degree[]` of length `n` to keep track of the number of roads connected to each city.
   - Use a 2D boolean array `isConnected[][]` of size `n x n` to keep track of whether there is a direct road between two cities.

2. **Process the Roads:**
   - Iterate over the `roads` array to populate the `degree[]` array and mark the `isConnected[][]` array.

3. **Calculate Maximal Network Rank:**
   - Iterate over all pairs of cities `(i, j)` to calculate the network rank.
   - Use the `degree[]` array to calculate the rank. If `i` and `j` are directly connected, subtract one from their combined degree count since the road would be counted twice otherwise.

4. **Return the Maximum Network Rank:**
   - Keep track of the maximum network rank encountered during the iteration over city pairs.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is O(n^2) since we are iterating over all pairs of cities, and for each pair, the operations are constant time.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maximalNetworkRank(int n, int[][] roads) {
        int[] degree = new int[n];
        boolean[][] isConnected = new boolean[n][n];

        // Process roads to populate degree and isConnected arrays
        for (int[] road : roads) {
            int city1 = road[0];
            int city2 = road[1];
            degree[city1]++;
            degree[city2]++;
            isConnected[city1][city2] = true;
            isConnected[city2][city1] = true;
        }

        int maxRank = 0;

        // Iterate over all pairs of cities to find their network rank
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                int currentRank = degree[i] + degree[j];
                if (isConnected[i][j]) {
                    currentRank--; // Subtract one if there is a direct connection between i and j
                }
                maxRank = Math.max(maxRank, currentRank);
            }
        }

        return maxRank;
    }
}
```

### Summary
This code efficiently calculates the maximal network rank of any two different cities by using arrays to store degrees of cities and connectivity information. The solution is O(n^2) due to the double loop over city pairs, which is optimal given the constraints.
