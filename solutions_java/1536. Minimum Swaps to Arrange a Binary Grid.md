[Leetcode 1536. Minimum Swaps to Arrange a Binary Grid full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1536)
## Problem Statement:
You are given an `n x n` binary grid. A move consists of choosing two rows and swapping them.

A grid is said to be valid if all the cells above the main diagonal are zero.

Return the minimum number of moves needed to make the grid valid, or -1 if the grid cannot be valid.

Example:
```
Input: grid = [[0,0,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,0]]
Output: 3
```

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **What are the constraints on the grid size?**
   - The size `n` of the grid is `1 <= n <= 50`.
   
2. **Can we have any assumptions about the grid content?**
   - The grid is binary, meaning it contains only `0`s and `1`s.
   
3. **Do we need to consider any specific time complexity?**
   - The solution should ideally be within a time complexity reasonable for `n x n` grids up to `50 x 50`.

## Strategy:
1. **Identify the List of Trailing Zeros:**
   - For each row in the grid, calculate the number of trailing zeros. This will help determine how far each row can move upwards while maintaining a valid grid state.

2. **Determine the Validity of the Grid:**
   - A grid row `i` requires at least `n-1-i` trailing zeros to be valid at position `i`. This is because for the row `i` to have all zeros above the diagonal, the number of trailing zeros must accommodate the necessary shifts.

3. **Calculate Minimum Swaps:**
   - Traverse the list of trailing zeros and count minimum swaps needed to bring the desired row with enough trailing zeros up to its required position. If a row cannot be brought up, return `-1`.

## Code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MinimumSwapsBinaryGrid {

    public int minSwaps(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        int[] trailingZeros = new int[n];
        
        // Step 1: Calculate the trailing zeros for each row
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            trailingZeros[i] = countTrailingZeros(grid[i]);
        }
        
        int swaps = 0;
        
        // Step 2: For each row i, we need at least n-1-i trailing zeros
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int requiredZeros = n - 1 - i;
            int row = i;
            
            // Find a row with at least requiredZeros trailing zeros
            while (row < n && trailingZeros[row] < requiredZeros) {
                row++;
            }
            
            // If no such row is found, return -1
            if (row == n) {
                return -1;
            }
            
            // Swap rows to bring the found row up to the ith position
            for (int j = row; j > i; j--) {
                int temp = trailingZeros[j];
                trailingZeros[j] = trailingZeros[j - 1];
                trailingZeros[j - 1] = temp;
                swaps++;
            }
        }
        
        return swaps;
    }

    private int countTrailingZeros(int[] row) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = row.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (row[i] == 1) {
                break;
            }
            count++;
        }
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumSwapsBinaryGrid sol = new MinimumSwapsBinaryGrid();
        int[][] grid = {
            {0, 0, 1}, 
            {1, 1, 0}, 
            {1, 0, 0}
        };
        System.out.println(sol.minSwaps(grid)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:
- **Calculating trailing zeros:** O(n^2) because we iterate through each element in the grid.
- **Swapping process:** O(n^2) because in the worst case, we might need to check and swap each row multiple times.

Hence, the overall time complexity is **O(n^2)** which is feasible for `1 <= n <= 50`.
