[Leetcode 2402. Meeting Rooms III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2402)
## Problem Statement
Given an array `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]`, representing the start and end time of the i-th meeting, and an integer `n` representing the number of meeting rooms, return the number of meetings that rooms can host.

The goal is to maximize the utilization of the meeting rooms. A meeting room can host only one meeting at a time and cannot start a new meeting while the current meeting is ongoing.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size Constraints**: What are the constraints for the number of meetings and the length of each meeting?
2. **Meeting Times Overlap**: Is it guaranteed that the end time of one meeting is not the start time of another meeting?
3. **Exact Room Usage**: Do we need the exact number of meeting rooms used, or focus on the number of meetings that can be hosted?

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MeetingRooms {

    public int maxMeetings(int[][] intervals, int n) {
        if (intervals == null || intervals.length == 0 || n == 0) return 0;

        // Sort intervals based on their start time
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);

        // Priority Queue to keep track of end times in ascending order
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();

        int meetingCount = 0;

        for (int[] interval : intervals) {
            // Free up rooms which have ended before this meeting's start time
            while (!pq.isEmpty() && pq.peek() <= interval[0]) {
                pq.poll();
            }

            // If there's a room available, host the meeting
            if (pq.size() < n) {
                pq.add(interval[1]);
                meetingCount++;
            }
        }

        return meetingCount;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MeetingRooms solution = new MeetingRooms();
        int[][] intervals = {
                {0, 30},
                {5, 10},
                {15, 20}
        };
        int n = 2;
        // Expected Output: Number of meetings that can be hosted is 2
        System.out.println(solution.maxMeetings(intervals, n)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

## Strategy
1. **Sorting**:
    - Sort the intervals based on their start times. This helps in iterating through each meeting in chronological order.
2. **Priority Queue**:
    - Use a PriorityQueue to keep track of ongoing meetings by their end times.
    - This allows for efficient freeing up of rooms as soon as a meeting ends.

3. **Simulation**:
    - For each meeting, check if a room is available by comparing with the earliest ending meeting.
    - Add the meeting to the queue if a room is available.
    - Count the meetings that can be hosted.

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: O(m log m), where m is the number of meetings (intervals).
- **PriorityQueue operations**: Each of the m meetings has a potential pq operation, leading to O(m log n) for the pq operations because the size of the pq is bounded by n (number of rooms).

Overall, the solution runs in **O(m log m + m log n)** time complexity.
