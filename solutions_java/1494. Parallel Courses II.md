[Leetcode 1494. Parallel Courses II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1494)
### Problem Statement

**LeetCode 1494: Parallel Courses II**

You are given `n` courses labeled from `1` to `n` and an array `dependencies` where `dependencies[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a prerequisite relationship, that is, course `xi` must be taken before course `yi`. You also have an integer `k`.

In one semester, you can take at most `k` courses as long as you have taken all the prerequisites for the courses you are taking.

Return the minimum number of semesters needed to take all courses.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Can there be cycles in the dependency graph?
   **A**: No, the problem assumes that the input and dependencies do not form a cycle since it's described as a prerequisite relationship.
   
2. **Q**: Can `k` be larger than `n`?
   **A**: Yes, `k` can be any value from `1` to `n`. If `k` is larger than `n`, it just means you can take all remaining courses in one semester.

3. **Q**: Can there be multiple dependencies for a single course?
   **A**: Yes, a course can have multiple prerequisites as given in the `dependencies` array.

### Strategy
This problem can be approached using Dynamic Programming (DP) combined with Bitmasking.

1. **State Representation**:
   - Use an integer `mask` to represent the set of courses that have been taken. If the `i-th` bit in the `mask` is `1`, it means the `i-th` course has been taken.

2. **DP Definition**:
   - Let `dp[mask]` represent the minimum number of semesters needed to complete the courses represented by `mask`.

3. **Transition**:
   - Iterate over all possible subsets of courses that can be taken in one semester.

4. **Initialization and Goal**:
   - Initialize `dp[0] = 0` because no semesters are needed if no courses are taken.
   - Return `dp[(1 << n) - 1]` which represents the state where all courses are taken.

### Code
```java
import java.util.*;

public class ParallelCoursesII {
    
    public int minNumberOfSemesters(int n, int[][] dependencies, int k) {
        int[] prereq = new int[n];
        for (int[] dep : dependencies) {
            // Convert to 0-based index and update the prerequisites bitmask
            prereq[dep[1] - 1] |= (1 << (dep[0] - 1));
        }
        
        int totalStates = 1 << n;
        int[] dp = new int[totalStates];
        Arrays.fill(dp, n + 1);  // Initially, set to a large number
        dp[0] = 0;  // No semesters needed to complete no courses.
        
        for (int state = 0; state < totalStates; state++) {
            if (dp[state] == n + 1) continue;  // Skip if it's an invalid state
            
            List<Integer> availableCourses = new ArrayList<>();
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                // If the course is not taken and all prerequisites are met.
                if ((state & (1 << i)) == 0 && (state & prereq[i]) == prereq[i]) {
                    availableCourses.add(i);
                }
            }
            
            // Go through all subsets of availableCourses
            int subsetCount = availableCourses.size();
            for (int subset = 1; subset < (1 << subsetCount); subset++) {
                if (Integer.bitCount(subset) > k) continue;  // More than k courses in this subset
                
                int nextState = state;
                for (int j = 0; j < subsetCount; j++) {
                    if ((subset & (1 << j)) != 0) {
                        nextState |= (1 << availableCourses.get(j));
                    }
                }
                dp[nextState] = Math.min(dp[nextState], dp[state] + 1);
            }
        }
        
        return dp[totalStates - 1];
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ParallelCoursesII solver = new ParallelCoursesII();
        int n = 4;
        int[][] dependencies = // use example from above
        int k = 2;
        System.out.println(solver.minNumberOfSemesters(n, dependencies, k));  // Expected output: 3
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(2^n \cdot n \cdot (2^k))\) 
    - There are \(2^n\) states.
    - For each state, calculating the available courses takes \(O(n)\).
    - Generating all subsets of available courses has complexity \(O(2^k)\). This is feasible given that \(k \le n\).

- **Space Complexity**: \(O(2^n)\) for DP array.

This approach ensures that we efficiently navigate through all possible course selections in optimal semesters.
