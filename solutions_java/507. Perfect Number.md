[Leetcode 507. Perfect Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l507)
### Problem Statement

A **perfect number** is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. For example, 28 is a perfect number because its divisors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28, and 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28.

Write a function that checks if a given number is a perfect number.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Input**: What is the range of the integer that we will be testing for being a perfect number?
   - *Assumption*: The input is a positive integer and fits within the bounds of a 32-bit signed integer.

2. **Return Value**: What should be the return type and value?
   - The function should return a boolean value: `true` if the number is a perfect number and `false` otherwise.

3. **Edge Cases**: How to handle the number 1?
   - The number 1 is not a perfect number, so the function should return `false` for the input 1.

### Code

```java
public class PerfectNumber {
    public static boolean checkPerfectNumber(int num) {
        if (num <= 1) {
            return false;
        }

        int sum = 1;
        for (int i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) {
            if (num % i == 0) {
                sum += i;
                if (i != num / i) {
                    sum += num / i;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return sum == num;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 28;
        System.out.println(checkPerfectNumber(n)); // should return true
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Initial Check**: If `num` is less than or equal to 1, it cannot be a perfect number, so we return `false`.
2. **Sum of Divisors**: Initialize `sum` to 1 (since 1 is always a divisor for any number larger than 1).
3. **Square Root Optimization**: To find the divisors more efficiently, iterate from 2 to the square root of `num`. For each `i`:
   - If `i` is a divisor of `num`, add both `i` and `num/i` to the sum (if they are distinct).
4. **Comparison**: After completing the loop, compare `sum` with `num`. If they are equal, return `true`, otherwise return `false`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is O(sqrt(n)) because the loop runs until the square root of `num`.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

### Edge Cases

- The input number `1` which should return `false`.
- Smaller perfect numbers like `6` and larger ones like `28`.
- Large non-perfect numbers to check the efficiency.
