[Leetcode 944. Delete Columns to Make Sorted](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l944)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of `n` strings `strs`, each of the same length.

The strings can be arranged such that there is one string per row, making a grid. For example, `strs = ["abc", "bce", "cae"]` can be arranged as follows:
```
abc
bce
cae
```
You want to delete the columns that are **not sorted lexicographically**. In the above example (0-indexed), columns 0 ('a', 'b', 'c') and 2 ('c', 'e', 'e') are sorted, while column 1 ('b', 'c', 'a') is not. So you would delete column 1.

Return the number of columns that you will delete.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are all input strings guaranteed to have the same length?
   - Yes, as per the problem statement.
2. Can the input strings contain any characters other than lowercase alphabets?
   - The problem implicitly assumes that strings contain only lowercase English letters.
3. What is the range of n (number of strings) and the length of each string?
   - Per typical constraints: 1 <= n <= 1000, 1 <= length of strings <= 1000.

### Strategy

1. Loop over each column (from 0 to length-1 of the strings).
2. For each column, check each adjacent pair of strings to see if the characters in the current column are in non-decreasing order.
3. If a column is found that is not sorted, increment the count of columns to delete.
4. Return the count of columns to delete.

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int minDeletionSize(String[] strs) {
        int numCols = strs[0].length();
        int numRows = strs.length;
        int columnsToDelete = 0;
        
        for (int col = 0; col < numCols; col++) {
            for (int row = 1; row < numRows; row++) {
                if (strs[row].charAt(col) < strs[row-1].charAt(col)) {
                    columnsToDelete++;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return columnsToDelete;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Outer Loop** (over columns): O(m), where m is the length of each string.
- **Inner Loop** (over rows): O(n), where n is the number of strings.
- The overall time complexity is **O(n * m)**.

This ensures that we can handle the worst-case scenario efficiently, whether sorting or checking constraints on the input strings.
