[Leetcode 1443. Minimum Time to Collect All Apples in a Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1443)
### Problem Statement
Given an undirected tree consisting of `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n-1`, which has apple(s) in some of its vertices. You spend 1 second to walk over one edge of the tree. Return the minimum time in seconds you have to spend to collect all apples in the tree, starting at vertex `0` and coming back to this vertex.

The edges of the undirected tree are given in the array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` means that there is an edge connecting the vertices `ai` and `bi`.

Additionally, there is a boolean array `hasApple`, where `hasApple[i] = true` means that vertex `i` has an apple; otherwise, it does not.

### Example
#### Example 1

```
Input:
n = 7
edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]]
hasApple = [false,false,true,false,true,true,false]

Output: 8
```

#### Constraints

- 1 <= n <= 10^5
- edges.length == n - 1
- edges[i].length == 2
- 0 <= ai, bi < n
- ai != bi
- hasApple.length == n

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the tree structure? 
    - The tree is an undirected and connected graph with `n` nodes and `n-1` edges.
2. What if there are no apples on the tree?
    - If there are no apples, the total time would be `0` as there is no need to traverse any edges.
3. Can we assume all edge weights are the same?
    - Yes, all edges take 1 second to traverse.

### Strategy
1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the tree using an adjacency list for ease of traversal.
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Perform a DFS traversal starting from vertex `0`.
    - We recursively visit each child node and accumulate the total time required to collect apples from subtrees.
    - If a vertex (or its descendants) contains any apples, we account for the time spent moving to and from that vertex.

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - Only one node (root) with or without an apple.

### Code
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int minTime(int n, int[][] edges, List<Boolean> hasApple) {
        // Build the graph representation
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            graph.get(edge[0]).add(edge[1]);
            graph.get(edge[1]).add(edge[0]);
        }

        // Perform DFS to compute the minimum time
        return dfs(0, -1, graph, hasApple);
    }

    private int dfs(int node, int parent, List<List<Integer>> graph, List<Boolean> hasApple) {
        int totalTime = 0;
        // Traverse the neighbors
        for (int neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
            if (neighbor == parent) continue; // Avoid revisiting the parent node
            int timeFromChild = dfs(neighbor, node, graph, hasApple);

            // If the child has apples or any of its descendants have, we need to account for it
            if (timeFromChild > 0 || hasApple.get(neighbor)) {
                totalTime += timeFromChild + 2; // 2 seconds to go and come back
            }
        }
        return totalTime;
    }

    // Testing the solution
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[][] edges = // use example above
        List<Boolean> hasApple = Arrays.asList(false, false, true, false, true, true, false);
        System.out.println(sol.minTime(7, edges, hasApple)); // Output should be 8
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes. Each node is visited once during the DFS traversal.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for storing the graph representation (adjacency list).

This solution efficiently computes the minimum required time to collect all apples in the tree starting from vertex `0` and returning back to it.
