[Leetcode 354. Russian Doll Envelopes full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l354)
### Problem Statement

The "Russian Doll Envelopes" problem is a classic algorithmic challenge. You are given a list of envelopes, each with a width and a height. One envelope can fit into another if and only if both the width and height of one envelope are greater than the width and height of the other envelope, respectively. The goal is to find the maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll (i.e., put one inside the other). 

- Each envelope can be put into another envelope if and only if both the width and height of one envelope is greater than the width and height of another envelope.
- You cannot rotate an envelope.

**Example:**

```
Input: envelopes = [[5,4],[6,4],[6,7],[2,3]]
Output: 3
Explanation: The maximum number of envelopes you can Russian doll is 3 ([2,3] => [5,4] => [6,7]).
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the number of envelopes or their dimensions?
   - Usually, constraints would be 1 <= envelopes.length <= 10^4 and 1 <= width, height <= 10^4.

2. **Sorting**: Can the envelopes be sorted based on their dimensions?
   - Yes, sorting by width and using height needs to be considered carefully for the correct ordering.

3. **Dynamic Programming**: Should we consider using a dynamic programming approach for the maximum sequence determination?
   - Likely, since itâ€™s a classic approach for such problems.

### Strategy

1. **Sort Envelopes**: First, sort the envelopes. We should sort by width in increasing order. If two envelopes have the same width, we sort by height in decreasing order.
   - This guarantees that in sorted order, we will only have to deal with increasing heights for valid envelopes.
   
2. **Finding LIS on Heights**: Extract the heights of the sorted envelopes and find the Longest Increasing Subsequence (LIS) on these heights.
   - We can use a binary search to efficiently compute the LIS in \(O(n \log n)\) time.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int maxEnvelopes(int[][] envelopes) {
        if (envelopes == null || envelopes.length == 0 || envelopes[0].length != 2) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Step 1: Sort envelopes
        Arrays.sort(envelopes, (a, b) -> {
            if (a[0] == b[0]) {
                return b[1] - a[1];
            } else {
                return a[0] - b[0];
            }
        });

        // Step 2: Extract heights and find LIS
        int[] heights = new int[envelopes.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < envelopes.length; i++) {
            heights[i] = envelopes[i][1];
        }

        return lengthOfLIS(heights);
    }

    private int lengthOfLIS(int[] nums) {
        int[] dp = new int[nums.length];
        int len = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            int index = Arrays.binarySearch(dp, 0, len, num);
            if (index < 0) {
                index = -(index + 1);
            }
            dp[index] = num;
            if (index == len) {
                len++;
            }
        }

        return len;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[][] envelopes = \ use example from above
        System.out.println(sol.maxEnvelopes(envelopes));  // Output: 3
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting**: The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\) where \(n\) is the number of envelopes.
2. **Finding LIS**: The LIS step also takes \(O(n \log n)\) due to the binary search within the dynamic array.
   
Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\). The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the additional arrays used.
