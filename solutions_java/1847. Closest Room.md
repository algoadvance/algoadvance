[Leetcode 1847. Closest Room](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1847)
## Problem Statement

You have a list of `rooms` where `rooms[i] = [roomId_i, size_i]` contains the ID and size of the `iᵗʰ` room respectively. You also have a list of `queries` where `queries[j] = [preferred_j, minSize_j]`. The answer to the `jᵗʰ` query is the ID of the room that is closest to the `preferred_j` room and has a size of at least `minSize_j`. If there is a tie in the room ID, choose the smaller room ID. If no such room exists, the answer is `-1`.

Return a list of answers for each query.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of values for `rooms` and `queries`?
   - Both `rooms` and `queries` lists can have up to `10^5` elements.
   - `roomId_i` and `size_i` range from `1` to `10^7`.
   
2. What if two rooms are equidistant from the preferred room?
   - If two rooms are equally close, the room with the smaller ID should be chosen.

## Strategy

1. **Sorting**:
   - Sort the rooms by their size in descending order.
   - Pair each query with its original index and sort the queries by their minimum size in descending order.

2. **Data Structures**:
   - Use a `TreeSet` to store the room IDs. A `TreeSet` allows for efficient searching, inserting, and finding the closest values.

3. **Process Queries**:
   - Iterate through the queries. For each query, add all rooms that satisfy the size condition to the `TreeSet`.
   - Use the `TreeSet` to find the closest room ID to the preferred room.

4. **Result Compilation**:
   - Store the results, index them back to the original query order, and return the results as a list.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class ClosestRoom {
    public int[] closestRoom(int[][] rooms, int[][] queries) {
        // Sort rooms by size in descending order
        Arrays.sort(rooms, (a, b) -> b[1] - a[1]);
        
        // Pair each query with its index and sort queries by minSize in descending order
        int[][] indexedQueries = new int[queries.length][3];
        for (int i = 0; i < queries.length; i++) {
            indexedQueries[i][0] = queries[i][0]; // preferred
            indexedQueries[i][1] = queries[i][1]; // minSize
            indexedQueries[i][2] = i;             // original index
        }
        Arrays.sort(indexedQueries, (a, b) -> b[1] - a[1]);
        
        TreeSet<Integer> validRoomIds = new TreeSet<>();
        int[] result = new int[queries.length];
        int roomIndex = 0;

        for (int[] query : indexedQueries) {
            int preferred = query[0];
            int minSize = query[1];
            int queryIndex = query[2];

            // Add all rooms that are large enough to the TreeSet
            while (roomIndex < rooms.length && rooms[roomIndex][1] >= minSize) {
                validRoomIds.add(rooms[roomIndex][0]);
                roomIndex++;
            }
            
            if (validRoomIds.isEmpty()) {
                result[queryIndex] = -1;
                continue;
            }
            
            // Find closest room ID
            Integer floor = validRoomIds.floor(preferred);
            Integer ceiling = validRoomIds.ceiling(preferred);
            if (floor == null && ceiling == null) {
                result[queryIndex] = -1;
            } else if (floor == null) {
                result[queryIndex] = ceiling;
            } else if (ceiling == null) {
                result[queryIndex] = floor;
            } else {
                result[queryIndex] = Math.abs(preferred - floor) <= Math.abs(preferred - ceiling) ? floor : ceiling;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ClosestRoom sol = new ClosestRoom();
        int[][] rooms = // use example above
        int[][] queries = // use example above
        int[] result = sol.closestRoom(rooms, queries);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(result));  // Example output: [2, 1, 1]
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting** rooms and queries both have complexity `O(N log N)` and `O(Q log Q)` respectively.
- **TreeSet Operations**:
  - Insertion and searching inside a `TreeSet` costs `O(log N)`.

**Overall Time Complexity**: `O((N + Q) log N)` where `N` is the number of rooms and `Q` is the number of queries.
