[Leetcode 2401. Longest Nice Subarray](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2401)
### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 2401: **Longest Nice Subarray**

Given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers, you need to identify the longest nice subarray. A subarray is considered nice if the bitwise AND of every pair of elements that are part of it is zero. Find the length of the longest nice subarray.

### Example

```java
Input: nums = [1,3,8,48,10]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest nice subarray is [3, 8, 48].
- 3 & 8 = 0
- 3 & 48 = 0
- 8 & 48 = 0
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the smallest and largest size of the input array `nums`?**
   - The size of `nums` can range from 1 to \(10^5\).

2. **What are the possible values of the elements in the input array `nums`?**
   - The elements are positive integers, up to \(10^9\).

3. **Is there any restriction on time complexity?**
   - Given the constraints, we should aim for a solution with a time complexity of O(n).

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently:
- Use a sliding window approach.
- Use a variable to keep track of the bitwise OR of the current window.
- Expand the window by moving one end. If a new element breaks the condition (bitwise AND of the subarray is not zero), shrink the window from the other end until the condition is restored.
- Track the maximum length of the window observed during this process.

### Code 

```java
public class LongestNiceSubarray {
    public int longestNiceSubarray(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int maxLength = 0, currentAnd = 0, left = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            while ((currentAnd & nums[right]) != 0) {
                currentAnd ^= nums[left];
                left++;
            }
            currentAnd |= nums[right];
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
        }
        
        return maxLength;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LongestNiceSubarray solution = new LongestNiceSubarray();
        int[] nums = {1, 3, 8, 48, 10};
        System.out.println(solution.longestNiceSubarray(nums)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

### Walkthrough

- **Initialization**: 
  - `maxLength` to record the maximum length of the nice subarray.
  - `currentAnd` to store the cumulative bitwise OR of the elements in the current window.
  - `left` pointer to manage the start of the sliding window.
  
- **Iteration**:
  - Iterate `right` from 0 to `n-1` to expand the window.
  - If `currentAnd & nums[right]` is not zero, it means adding `nums[right]` would break the nice subarray condition. So, we adjust the window size by moving the `left` pointer and updating `currentAnd` accordingly.
  - Update `currentAnd` with `nums[right]`.
  - Update `maxLength` with the size of the current window if it's larger than the previous maximum.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - In the worst case, each element is processed twice, once when expanding the window and once when shrinking it.

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Only a few integer variables are used irrespective of the input size.
