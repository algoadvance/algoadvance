[Leetcode 1975. Maximum Matrix Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1975)
### Problem Statement
We are given an `n x n` integer matrix. The goal is to find the maximum sum of matrix elements after performing any number of row or column negations. A row or column negation means changing the sign of each element in that row or column.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:** What are the limits on `n` and the values within the matrix?
   - Usually, `n` should be reasonable to allow feasible computation within limited time.

2. **Negative element handling:** Should we prioritize flipping rows or columns, or does it not matter?
   - Generally, it should not matter since flipping operations can be equivalent when considering final absolute sums.

### Strategy
1. **Absolute Sum with Parity Check:**
   - Calculate the initial sum of the absolute values of all elements in the matrix.
   - Count the number of negative elements; this informs us about the minimal section's value drift due to negation strategies.

2. **Minimum Absolute Value Consideration:**
   - Even number of negative values: The entire matrix can be turned into non-negative elements.
   - Odd number of negative values: One element must remain negative if an odd parity persists. Leave the smallest absolute value in negative mode to minimize loss.

### Code

```java
public class MaximumMatrixSum {
    public long maxMatrixSum(int[][] matrix) {
        int n = matrix.length;
        long totalSum = 0;
        int negativeCount = 0;
        int minAbsValue = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                int value = matrix[i][j];
                if (value < 0) {
                    negativeCount++;
                }
                totalSum += Math.abs(value);
                minAbsValue = Math.min(minAbsValue, Math.abs(value));
            }
        }

        // If we have an odd number of negative values, we must subtract twice the smallest absolute value
        if (negativeCount % 2 != 0) {
            totalSum -= 2 * minAbsValue;
        }

        return totalSum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximumMatrixSum solution = new MaximumMatrixSum();
        int[][] matrix = {
            {1, -1, 3},
            {-1, -1, -1},
            {1, 1, 1}
        };
        long result = solution.maxMatrixSum(matrix);
        System.out.println("Maximum matrix sum: " + result); // Output: maximum sum after adjustments
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **O(n^2):**
  - We traverse the entire `n x n` matrix once to compute the required values.
  - This ensures that the method efficiently scales even for larger `n`.

### Conclusion
This solution efficiently computes the maximum possible sum for the matrix by judiciously handling negations based on the parity of negative elements while focusing on their absolute impacts. The approach ensures that regardless of the initial configuration of positives and negatives, the maximum sum is derived correctly.
