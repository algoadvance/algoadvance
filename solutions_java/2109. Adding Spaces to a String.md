[Leetcode 2109. Adding Spaces to a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2109)
### Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** string `s` and a **0-indexed** integer array `spaces` that describes the indices in the original string where spaces will be added. Each space should be inserted before the character at the given index in `spaces`.

- For example, consider `s = "EnjoyYourFood"` and `spaces = [5, 9]`, inserting spaces at indices 5 and 9 will result in `"Enjoy Your Food"`.

Return **the modified string** after the spaces have been added.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: What is the range of lengths for the string `s` and the array `spaces`?**
   - A: The length of `s` is between 1 and \(10^6\). The length of `spaces` is between 1 and \(10^5\).

2. **Q: Are the indices in `spaces` always sorted in ascending order?**
   - A: Yes, the indices in `spaces` are sorted in ascending order.

3. **Q: Can there be duplicate values in `spaces`?**
   - A: No, there are no duplicate values in `spaces`.

4. **Q: Will the indices in `spaces` always be within the bounds of the string `s`?**
   - A: Yes, all indices will be valid and within the bounds of the string `s`.

### Strategy

- We will iterate through the string `s` and use a pointer or position index to insert spaces at the given indices in `spaces`.
- As we iterate, we will use a pointer for `spaces` to decide when to add a space.
  
Steps:
1. Initialize a `StringBuilder` to build the final modified string.
2. Use two indices, one for iterating through `s` and one for iterating through `spaces`.
3. For each character in `s`, check if the current index is in `spaces`. If it is, add a space before adding the character to the `StringBuilder`.
4. Move to the next index and repeat until the entire string is processed.

### Time Complexity

- Inserting spaces can be done in a single pass through the string `s`, and there is a single pass through the `spaces` array.
- Thus, the time complexity is **O(n + m) where n is the length of s and m is the length of spaces**.

### Code

Here's a potential implementation to solve the problem:

```java
public class Solution {
    public String addSpaces(String s, int[] spaces) {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        int spaceIndex = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            // Check if we need to add a space at the current index
            if (spaceIndex < spaces.length && i == spaces[spaceIndex]) {
                result.append(' ');
                spaceIndex++;
            }
            // Add the current character to the result
            result.append(s.charAt(i));
        }
        return result.toString();
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**:
   - A `StringBuilder` called `result` is used to construct the final string efficiently.
   - An integer `spaceIndex` is initialized to traverse the `spaces` array.

2. **Iteration**:
   - We loop through each character of the string `s`.
   - If `i` matches the current index in the `spaces` array (`spaces[spaceIndex]`), we append a space to the `result` and update `spaceIndex` to point to the next index in `spaces`.

3. **Appending characters**:
   - Regardless of whether a space was added or not, append the current character `s.charAt(i)` to `result`.

4. **Return**:
   - Convert the `StringBuilder` to a string and return it.

This approach ensures that we handle large inputs efficiently within the given constraints.
