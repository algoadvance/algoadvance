[Leetcode 1489. Find Critical and Pseudo](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1489)
### Problem Statement

**1489. Find Critical and Pseudo-Critical Edges in Minimum Spanning Tree**

Given a weighted, undirected graph with `n` vertices and `m` edges, return the edges that are critical and pseudo-critical edges in a minimum spanning tree (MST) of the graph.

- An edge is critical if its deletion from the graph would cause the MST weight to change.
- An edge is pseudo-critical if it belongs to some MST, and there is at least one MST of the graph where it is included.

### Clarifying Questions

To fully understand the problem, make sure to inquire about:

1. **Edge Weight Uniqueness**: Confirm whether edge weights are unique. This affects the structure of the MST.
2. **Constraints**: Understand the constraints on `n` and `m` to ensure using efficient data structures and algorithms.
3. **Input Format**: Confirm the format of the input - usually `n`, and `edge list`, where each edge is represented by a triplet `[u, v, w]` signifying an edge between vertices `u` and `v` with weight `w`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will employ the following steps:

1. **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Use Kruskal's algorithm to find the MST of the original graph. This will give us the MST and its total weight.
2. **Critical Edges**:
   - Remove each edge and calculate the total weight of the MST without this edge.
   - If the weight increases or the MST cannot be formed, mark the edge as critical.
3. **Pseudo-Critical Edges**:
   - Force the inclusion of each edge in the MST and calculate the total weight.
   - If the resulting total weight is equivalent to the MST weight of the original graph, mark the edge as pseudo-critical.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> findCriticalAndPseudoCriticalEdges(int n, int[][] edges) {
        int m = edges.length;
        
        // Add an index to each edge for identification
        int[][] newEdges = new int[m][4];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            newEdges[i][0] = edges[i][0];
            newEdges[i][1] = edges[i][1];
            newEdges[i][2] = edges[i][2];
            newEdges[i][3] = i; // original index
        }
        
        // Sort edges based on weight
        Arrays.sort(newEdges, Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[2]));
        
        // Function to find the parent of a vertex
        int[] parent = new int[n];
        int[] rank = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) parent[i] = i;
        
        int find(int x) {
            if (parent[x] != x) parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
            return parent[x];
        }
        
        // Function to union two subsets
        boolean union(int x, int y) {
            int rootX = find(x), rootY = find(y);
            if (rootX != rootY) {
                if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]) parent[rootY] = rootX;
                else if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]) parent[rootX] = rootY;
                else { parent[rootY] = rootX; rank[rootX]++; }
                return true;
            }
            return false;
        }
        
        // Function to run Kruskal's algorithm and return MST weight
        int kruskal(int excludeEdgeIndex, int includeEdgeIndex) {
            Arrays.fill(parent, 0);
            Arrays.fill(rank, 0);
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) parent[i] = i;
            
            int totalWeight = 0, edgeCount = 0;
            
            // If we need to include a specific edge
            if (includeEdgeIndex != -1) {
                int[] edge = newEdges[includeEdgeIndex];
                union(edge[0], edge[1]);
                totalWeight += edge[2];
                edgeCount++;
            }
            
            // Run Kruskal's algorithm
            for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
                if (i == excludeEdgeIndex) continue;
                int[] edge = newEdges[i];
                if (union(edge[0], edge[1])) {
                    totalWeight += edge[2];
                    edgeCount++;
                    if (edgeCount == n - 1) break;
                }
            }
            
            return edgeCount == n - 1 ? totalWeight : Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        }
        
        int originalMSTWeight = kruskal(-1, -1);
        List<Integer> criticalEdges = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Integer> pseudoCriticalEdges = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            // Check for critical edges
            if (kruskal(i, -1) > originalMSTWeight) {
                criticalEdges.add(newEdges[i][3]);
            } else if (kruskal(-1, i) == originalMSTWeight) {
                // Check for pseudo-critical edges
                pseudoCriticalEdges.add(newEdges[i][3]);
            }
        }
        
        return Arrays.asList(criticalEdges, pseudoCriticalEdges);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Kruskal’s Algorithm**: O(E log E)
    - Sorting edges takes O(E log E).
    - Union-Find operations take almost constant time, O(E * α(V)), where α is the inverse Ackermann function.

- **Overall**:
  - For each edge, we run Kruskal’s algorithm twice (once excluding the edge and once including the edge).
  - The total time complexity becomes O(E * (V + E log E)) due to the multiple runs of Kruskal’s algorithm.

This approach effectively identifies both critical and pseudo-critical edges in the given graph while maintaining efficiency.
