[Leetcode 2952. Minimum Number of Coins to be Added](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2952)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer `n` and an array `coins` of size `m` representing the coins you currently have, you want to form `n` using the minimum number of additional coins. You need to determine the minimum number of coins needed to be added to achieve exactly `n`.

#### Example

1. `n = 10`, `coins = [1, 3, 7]`
   
   Output: `1` (You need an additional coin of value `2`)

2. `n = 10`, `coins = [1, 4, 6]`
   
   Output: `1` (You need an additional coin of value `5`)

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for `n` and the values in the `coins` array?**
   - Typically, `1 <= n <= 10^5` and `1 <= coin_value <= 10^5`.

2. **Can coins contain duplicate values?**
   - Assuming they do not contain duplicates for this problem.

3. **Is the array `coins` sorted?**
   - Assuming the array is not sorted initially.

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to determine the minimum number of coins to be added to the given set of coins so that we can create exact change for `n`.

2. **Brute Force Approach**:
   - Generate all possible sums using the current set of coins.
   - Check the missing values between 1 and `n`.
   - Find the minimum number of additional coins required to generate the missing values.

3. **Greedy Approach**:
   - Sort the current set of coins.
   - Use a greedy approach to find the gaps in the sums and add the minimum number of additional coins to fill those gaps.

### Code

Hereâ€™s a possible implementation in Java:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MinimumCoins {
    
    public static int minCoinsToAdd(int n, int[] coins) {
        Arrays.sort(coins);
        long reach = 0;  // To handle large intermediate sums
        int addedCoins = 0;
        int i = 0, m = coins.length;
        
        while (reach < n) {
            if (i < m && coins[i] <= reach + 1) {
                reach += coins[i];
                i++;
            } else {
                reach += reach + 1;
                addedCoins++;
            }
        }
        return addedCoins;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 10;
        int[] coins = {1, 4, 6};
        System.out.println(minCoinsToAdd(n, coins));  // Output: 1
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Sorting**: We first sort the `coins` array to allow for efficient checks.
2. **Greedy Approach**:
   - Initialize `reach` to 0, representing the maximum value we can achieve with the current set of coins plus any additional ones found.
   - Iterate through the coins and try to extend the `reach`. If the next coin can fill a gap, add it. Otherwise, calculate the minimal coin value to fill the gap.
   - Continue the process until `reach` is at least `n`.

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the coins**: `O(m log m)`
- **Greedy Operation**: `O(n)`, in the worst case where we have to add coins up to `n`.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(m log m + n)`, where `m` is the length of the coins array and `n` is the target value.
