[Leetcode 2870. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Empty](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2870)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `A` and target integer `target`, you need to remove elements from the array until it becomes empty. In one operation, you can choose any subarray of `A` where all elements are `target` and remove that entire subarray. Your goal is to find the minimum number of operations required to make the array empty.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Limits**: What are the constraints on the size of the array `A` and the value of `target`?
   - Typically, arrays can vary in size but preprocessing such as checking max constraints will help ensure efficiency.
2. **Element Range**: What is the range of the integer values in the array?
   - Integer arrays typically assume large ranges but knowing specifics like bounds (e.g., `-10^4` to `10^4`) will help.
3. **Uniform Elements**: Can all elements be the same or all different?
   - This affects simplifying strategies (all `target` means array count/length, all non-target means zero).

### Strategy
Our strategy involves two main steps:
1. **Identify All Subsequences of `target`**:
   - Traverse through the array detecting contiguous subarrays where each element is `target`.
2. **Count the Subarrays**:
   - Every contiguous subarray of `target` values forms one operation. Simply count these subsequences.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] A, int target) {
        int operations = 0;
        boolean inSequence = false;

        for (int i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {
            if (A[i] == target) {
                if (!inSequence) {
                    // Start of a new sequence
                    inSequence = true;
                    operations++;
                }
            } else {
                // End of a sequence
                inSequence = false;
            }
        }

        return operations;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] A1 = {1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 1, 2};
        int target1 = 2;
        System.out.println(sol.minOperations(A1, target1)); // Output should be 3

        int[] A2 = {2, 2, 2, 2, 2};
        int target2 = 2;
        System.out.println(sol.minOperations(A2, target2)); // Output should be 1

        int[] A3 = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1};
        int target3 = 2;
        System.out.println(sol.minOperations(A3, target3)); // Output should be 0
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **O(n)**: The algorithm involves a single pass through the array detecting subsequences; hence, it is linear in relation to the size `n` of the array `A`.

This solution efficiently identifies and counts the minimum number of operations to remove all `target` values from the array by leveraging a simple traversal method and a state-tracking flag.
