[Leetcode 173. Binary Search Tree Iterator full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l173)
## Problem Statement

Implement an iterator over a binary search tree (BST). Your iterator will be initialized with the root node of a BST.

Calling `next()` will return the next smallest number in the BST.

**Example:**

```java
BSTIterator iterator = new BSTIterator(root);
iterator.next();    // return the next smallest number
iterator.hasNext(); // return whether we have a next smallest number
```

**Note:**
- `next()` and `hasNext()` should run in average `O(1)` time and use `O(h)` memory, where `h` is the height of the tree.
- You may assume that `next()` call will always be valid, that is, there will be at least a next smallest number in the BST when `next()` is called.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What kind of values can the BST nodes contain?**
   - The nodes contain integer values.

2. **Can the BST contain duplicate values?**
   - For the sake of this problem, let's assume that the BST does not contain duplicate values.

3. **Do we need to handle the initialization of the BST itself?**
   - No, we only need to handle the iteration over an already constructed BST.

## Strategy

We will use a stack to perform an in-order traversal of the tree, which will allow us to access the next smallest element in `O(1)` average time.

Here are the key points of our approach:
1. **Initialization (`BSTIterator(TreeNode root)`)**: 
    - We initialize a stack and push the leftmost path of the tree starting from the given root.
    
2. **Next Element (`next()`)**:
    - The `next()` method pops the top element from the stack (which represents the current smallest unvisited element).
    - If the popped element has a right child, we push the leftmost path of that right subtree to the stack.
    - Return the value of the popped element.

3. **Check for Next Element (`hasNext()`)**:
    - This method simply checks if there are any elements left in the stack.

## Code

```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class BSTIterator {
    private Stack<TreeNode> stack;

    public BSTIterator(TreeNode root) {
        stack = new Stack<>();
        // Initialize the stack with the leftmost path of the tree
        pushLeftPath(root);
    }
    
    /** @return the next smallest number */
    public int next() {
        TreeNode node = stack.pop();
        // If the node has a right child, push the leftmost path of the right subtree
        if (node.right != null) {
            pushLeftPath(node.right);
        }
        return node.val;
    }
    
    /** @return whether we have a next smallest number */
    public boolean hasNext() {
        return !stack.isEmpty();
    }
    
    // Helper function to push the leftmost path of a subtree onto the stack
    private void pushLeftPath(TreeNode node) {
        while (node != null) {
            stack.push(node);
            node = node.left;
        }
    }
}

class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization (`BSTIterator(TreeNode root)`)**: The initialization time is `O(h)` where `h` is the height of the BST, as we push the leftmost path onto the stack.

- **Next Element (`next()`)**: Each call to `next()` runs in average `O(1)` time. This is because each node is pushed and popped from the stack exactly once.

- **Check for Next Element (`hasNext()`)**: The `hasNext()` method runs in `O(1)` time because it simply checks if the stack is empty or not.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(h)` where `h` is the height of the BST, due to the stack storing nodes during traversal.

This approach ensures that we meet the problemâ€™s constraints and efficiently iterate over the BST.
