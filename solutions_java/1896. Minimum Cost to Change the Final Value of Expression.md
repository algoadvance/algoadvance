## Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 1896: Minimum Cost to Change the Final Value of the Expression

You are given a boolean expression with the following symbols:

- `'1'` represents the boolean value `True`
- `'0'` represents the boolean value `False`
- `'&'` represents the boolean `AND` operator
- `'|'` represents the boolean `OR` operator
- `'('` and `')'` are parentheses that group values and subexpressions

Your task is to determine the minimum cost to change the final value of the expression. Changing the final value means making modifications to the expression such that its evaluated boolean value changes from `True` to `False` or from `False` to `True`.

A modification means changing a `'0'` to `'1'`, a `'1'` to `'0'`, an `'&'` to `'|'`, or a `'|'` to `'&'`. Each modification has a cost of 1.

Return the minimum cost to change the final evaluated boolean value of the expression.

### Example
```text
Input: expression = "1&(0|1)"
Output: 1
Explanation: We can change 1&(0|1) to 1&(0&1), which evaluates to 0. The cost is 1.

Input: expression = "(0&0)&(0&0&0)"
Output: 3
Explanation: We can change "(0&0)&(0&0&0)" to "(1|0)&(0&0&0)", which evaluates to 0. The cost is 1 + 1 + 1 = 3.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input length and character constraints:**
   - What is the range of the length of the input expression?
   - Are there any characters other than `1`, `0`, `&`, `|`, `(`, and `)` in the input?

2. **Valid expression:**
   - Are we guaranteed that the input expression is always valid and well-formed?

3. **Output requirements:**
   - Are we expected to output the minimum cost as an integer?

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to evaluate the boolean expression and keep track of the costs needed to change the final value of any sub-expression. This will involve parsing the expression and evaluating the costs using a recursive approach.

Here's a high-level strategy:

1. **Parsing and Evaluation:**
   - Use a stack to handle the evaluation of the boolean expression.
   - For each operator and operand, calculate and store the minimum cost to flip its value.

2. **Cost Calculation:**
   - For each `&` operation, consider the cost to change it to `|` or change its operands so that the overall value flips.
   - Similarly, for `|`, consider changing it to `&` or changing its operands.

3. **Final Evaluation:**
   - After evaluating the whole expression, return the minimum cost stored at the root of the evaluation stack.

## Code

```java
import java.util.Stack;

class Solution {
    public int minOperationsToFlip(String expression) {
        Stack<int[]> values = new Stack<>();
        Stack<Character> ops = new Stack<>();

        for (char c : expression.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '0' || c == '1') {
                int val = c - '0';
                values.push(new int[]{val, 1});
            } else if (c == '(') {
                ops.push(c);
            } else if (c == ')') {
                while (ops.peek() != '(') {
                    values.push(applyOp(ops.pop(), values.pop(), values.pop()));
                }
                ops.pop();
            } else if (c == '&' || c == '|') {
                while (!ops.isEmpty() && precedence(ops.peek()) >= precedence(c)) {
                    values.push(applyOp(ops.pop(), values.pop(), values.pop()));
                }
                ops.push(c);
            }
        }
        
        while (!ops.isEmpty()) {
            values.push(applyOp(ops.pop(), values.pop(), values.pop()));
        }
        
        int[] root = values.pop();
        return root[1];
    }
    
    private int precedence(char op) {
        if (op == '&' || op == '|') return 1;
        return 0;
    }

    private int[] applyOp(char op, int[] b, int[] a) {
        int[] res = new int[2];
        if (op == '&') {
            res[0] = a[0] & b[0];
            if (res[0] == 1) res[1] = Math.min(a[1], b[1]);
            else res[1] = Math.min(a[1] + b[1], 1);
        } else if (op == '|') {
            res[0] = a[0] | b[0];
            if (res[0] == 1) res[1] = Math.min(a[1] + b[1], 1);
            else res[1] = Math.min(a[1], b[1]);
        }
        return res;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above solution is O(n), where n is the length of the expression. This is because we process each character in the expression exactly once in a single pass to evaluate and compute the minimum operation costs.

The stack operations (push and pop) are all O(1), so the additional overhead for stack management does not affect the linear complexity.

This ensures an efficient solution suitable for large expressions within typical competitive programming constraints.
