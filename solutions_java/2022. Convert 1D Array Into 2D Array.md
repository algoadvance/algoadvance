[Leetcode 2022. Convert 1D Array Into 2D Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2022)
### Problem Statement
You are given a 1D array `original` and two integers `m` and `n`. You are tasked with creating a 2D array with `m` rows and `n` columns using all the elements from the `original` array.

More formally, the transformed array should be such that:
- The values of the 2D array are filled row by row from the 1D array.
- If it is not possible to form the 2D array with the given dimensions, return an empty 2D array.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: original = [1,2,3,4], m = 2, n = 2
Output: [[1,2],[3,4]]

Input: original = [1,2,3], m = 1, n = 3
Output: [[1,2,3]]

Input: original = [1,2], m = 1, n = 1
Output: []

Input: original = [3], m = 1, n = 1
Output: [[3]]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can we assume that the input array and integers m and n are always provided and non-null?**
   - Yes.

2. **Do the values in the `original` array need to be unique?**
   - No, the values do not have to be unique; the task is just to reorganize the array.

3. **What should be returned if the transformation is not possible?**
   - An empty 2D array.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, the following steps can be taken:
1. **Check Feasibility:**
   - The 1D array can only be converted into an `m x n` 2D array if and only if the length of `original` is exactly `m * n`.
   
2. **Create the 2D Array:**
   - Initialize an empty 2D array of dimensions `m x n`.
   - Iterate over the original array and fill the 2D array row by row.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int[][] construct2DArray(int[] original, int m, int n) {
        int length = original.length;

        // Check if the transformation is feasible
        if (length != m * n) {
            return new int[0][];
        }

        int[][] result = new int[m][n];
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            result[i / n][i % n] = original[i];
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(m * n) since each element from the `original` array is accessed and placed exactly once in the resulting 2D array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m * n) for the resultant 2D array.

This problem involves straightforward looping and index calculations, making it efficient for the given constraints.
