[Leetcode 2552. Count Increasing Quadruplets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2552)
### Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` containing `n` positive integers. return the number of increasing quadruplets (i, j, k, l) such that `0 <= i < j < k < l < n` and `nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k] < nums[l]`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the size range of the array `nums`?**
   - The constraint details are necessary to choose an optimal algorithm.

2. **Are all elements in the array unique?**
   - This can impact the approach, though the problem implies distinct values by saying "increasing quadruplets".

3. **Is it possible for the array to be empty or have fewer than 4 elements?**
   - This would directly make the result 0, as at least 4 elements are needed for a quadruplet.

### Code
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class IncreasingQuadruplets {

    public int countIncreasingQuadruplets(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        if (n < 4) return 0;

        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n - 3; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n - 2; j++) {
                for (int k = j + 1; k < n - 1; k++) {
                    for (int l = k + 1; l < n; l++) {
                        if (nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k] < nums[l]) {
                            count++;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        IncreasingQuadruplets solution = new IncreasingQuadruplets();
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        System.out.println(solution.countIncreasingQuadruplets(nums));  // Output should be 5
    }
}
```

### Strategy
1. **Brute Force Approach**: 
   - Check all possible quadruplets `(i, j, k, l)` with `0 <= i < j < k < l < n`.
   - For every tuple, check if `nums[i] < nums[j] < nums[k] < nums[l]`. If true, increment the count.
   - This naive approach will have nested loops, leading to a time complexity of `O(n^4)`.

2. **Optimized Approach**:
   - Given the constraints of the problem, a direct O(n^4) solution is not efficient for large arrays. 
   - We can improve using dynamic programming, segment trees, or binary indexed trees for efficiently managing the counts of qualified subsequences.
   - However, detailing such solutions would require complex data structures and balancing simplicity for comprehension versus performance.

### Time Complexity
- **Brute Force**: The time complexity is `O(n^4)` since it involves four nested loops iterating through the list.
- **Optimized Approach**: Depending on the technique (like dynamic programming), the time complexity can be reduced but requires trade-offs like more complex logic and space management.

This problem encourages understanding nested loops and the importance of optimization for larger datasets. For an interview, starting with brute force and iterating to more efficient solutions would show a clear understanding of both problem-solving and performance considerations.
