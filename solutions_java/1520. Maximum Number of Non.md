[Leetcode 1520. Maximum Number of Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1520)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return the maximum number of non-overlapping substrings of `s` that contain all occurrences of their characters. Your answer must be a collection of substrings that are independent of each other. If there are multiple solutions, return the lexicographically smallest one.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the length range of the string `s`?
   - Are there any specific characters or is it any typical alphanumeric string?

2. **Output Characteristics:**
   - Should the function return an array/list of substrings?
   - Do overlapping substrings mean substrings that share any position in the `s` string?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should be returned if the string `s` is empty?
   - How to handle cases with all unique characters?

### Strategy

1. **Identify Character Ranges:**
   - First, determine the leftmost and rightmost indices for each character in the string `s`.
   
2. **Merge Overlapping Ranges:**
   - For each character's range, check if it overlaps with an already considered range. If it does, merge these ranges.

3. **Generate Non-overlapping Substrings:**
   - Sort the ranges based on their right endpoint to prioritize the creation of non-overlapping substrings.
   - Traverse these sorted ranges to form the maximum number of non-overlapping substrings.

4. **Obtain Lexicographically Smallest Solution:**
   - While traversing, ensure to keep the substrings lexicographically small by always choosing the leftmost starting point when there's a tie.
   
### Code

Here's the Java implementation:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class NonOverlappingSubstrings {

    public static List<String> maxNumOfSubstrings(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[] start = new int[26], end = new int[26];
        Arrays.fill(start, n);
        Arrays.fill(end, -1);
        
        // Determine start and end positions for each character
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            int idx = s.charAt(i) - 'a';
            start[idx] = Math.min(start[idx], i);
            end[idx] = Math.max(end[idx], i);
        }
        
        List<int[]> intervals = new ArrayList<>();
        // Calculate intervals
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; ++i) {
            if (end[i] == -1) continue;
            int l = start[i];
            int r = end[i];
            for (int j = l; j <= r; ++j) {
                l = Math.min(l, start[s.charAt(j) - 'a']);
                r = Math.max(r, end[s.charAt(j) - 'a']);
            }
            if (l == start[i]) intervals.add(new int[]{l, r});
        }

        Collections.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> a[1] - b[1]);
        
        List<String> res = new ArrayList<>();
        int lastEnd = -1;
        
        // Collect non-overlapping intervals
        for (int[] interval : intervals) {
            if (interval[0] > lastEnd) {
                res.add(s.substring(interval[0], interval[1] + 1));
                lastEnd = interval[1];
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "adefaddaccc";
        List<String> result = maxNumOfSubstrings(s);
        System.out.println(result);  // Expected: ["e", "f", "ccc"]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Identifying Start and End Points:**
  - O(n) for a single pass through the string to determine start and end indices for each character.
  
- **Generating Intervals:**
  - Worst-case O(n * 26) to adjust intervals, where n is the length of the string.

- **Sorting Intervals:**
  - O(k log k), where k is the number of valid intervals (k <= 26).

- **Final Collection of Substrings:**
  - O(k) to traverse the sorted intervals.

Thus, the overall complexity is dominated by O(n) since it's linear relative to the input string size.
