[Leetcode 2851. String Transformation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2851)
### Problem Statement

You are given two strings, start and end. Both strings have the same length and consist of only lowercase English letters. You can perform two types of operations on the string start:

1. Choose any two adjacent characters and swap them.
2. Choose any character and replace it with another lowercase English letter.

These operations can be performed any number of times.

Your task is to determine if you can transform the string start into the string end using these operations and if yes, print the minimum number of operations required to do so.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Character Swap:** Can we swap the same characters multiple times?
   - Yes, you can perform any swap operation on any adjacent characters multiple times.

2. **Character Replacement:** Can we replace a character by itself?
   - Yes, replacing a character by itself is also valid, though it is redundant.

3. **Output:** Should we return or print the result?
   - Return the minimum number of operations required as an integer.


### Strategy

1. **Check for Immediate Impossible Cases:** If the sorted versions of `start` and `end` strings do not match, it's immediately impossible to transform `start` to `end`.

2. **Character Replacement Calculation:**
   - Calculate the difference in character counts. If a character in `start` is less frequent than in `end`, the extra characters must be replaced.

3. **Calculate Swaps Needed:** Find positions where characters mismatch and count adjacent swaps needed to fix these mismatches. This would need careful consideration as the relative order should also be preserved.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    public int minOperations(String start, String end) {
        if (start.length() != end.length()) {
            return -1; // Early exit on length mismatch
        }
        
        // Frequency maps to count characters
        Map<Character, Integer> startFreq = new HashMap<>();
        Map<Character, Integer> endFreq = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (char ch : start.toCharArray()) {
            startFreq.put(ch, startFreq.getOrDefault(ch, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        for (char ch : end.toCharArray()) {
            endFreq.put(ch, endFreq.getOrDefault(ch, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        // If the two maps have different character frequencies, return -1
        if (!startFreq.equals(endFreq)) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        // Calculate minimum swaps needed using a two-pointer approach
        int operations = 0;
        char[] startArr = start.toCharArray();
        char[] endArr = end.toCharArray();
        
        for (int i = 0, j = 0; i < startArr.length; ) {
            if (startArr[i] != endArr[j]) {
                // Find the position in the start array that matches endArr[j]
                int k = i;
                while (k < startArr.length && startArr[k] != endArr[j]) {
                    k++;
                }
                // Perform adjacent swaps to move the character to correct position
                while (k > i) {
                    // Swap characters
                    char temp = startArr[k];
                    startArr[k] = startArr[k - 1];
                    startArr[k - 1] = temp;
                    k--;
                    operations++;
                }
            }
            // Move both pointers
            i++;
            j++;
        }
        
        return operations;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        String start = "aabbcc";
        String end = "ccbbaa";
        System.out.println(sol.minOperations(start, end)); // Example Output
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Frequency Check:** The time complexity for building the frequency maps is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the strings.
- **Swap Calculation:** The time complexity is also \(O(n)\) since we potentially swap up to every character and perform it in a linear pass.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\).
