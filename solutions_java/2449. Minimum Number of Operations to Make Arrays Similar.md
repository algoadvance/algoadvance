[Leetcode 2449. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Arrays Similar](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2449)
### Problem Statement

You are given two arrays, `nums` and `target`, of the same length. In one operation, you can choose any two adjacent elements in `nums` and swap them.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make `nums` similar to `target`.

Two arrays are considered similar if one can be obtained from the other by performing some number of swaps (possibly zero) of any two adjacent elements.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there constraints on the lengths of the arrays?**
   - Yes, `nums` and `target` have the same length.

2. **Can we have any constraints on the values inside the arrays?**
   - Standard array constraints typically apply (e.g., within `int` range).

3. **Are the arrays guaranteed to contain distinct elements or can they contain duplicates?**
   - The problem doesn't specify elements being distinct, so they can contain duplicates.

4. **What is the maximum size of the arrays?**
   - It's important to know this for performance considerations. Commonly, sizes can go up to 10^5 or 10^6, but refer to the exact constraints.

5. **Is there any additional information or constraints I should be aware of?**
   - No additional constraints provided.

### Strategy

1. **Understand the problem**: The task is to make `nums` similar to `target` using the minimum number of adjacent swaps.

2. **Approach**:
   - If we sort both `nums` and `target`, the problem reduces to finding the minimum number of swaps needed to match the sorted `nums` with the sorted `target`.
   - This is similar to the problem of minimum adjacent swaps in sorting.

3. **Steps**:
   1. Sort both `nums` and `target`.
   2. Count the number of positions at which `nums` and `target` do not match.
   3. Swaps needed to sort `nums` to `target` can be derived from the misalignment of elements between the sorted arrays.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MinimumOperationsToMakeArraysSimilar {

    public int minOperations(int[] nums, int[] target) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        Arrays.sort(target);

        int operations = 0;
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < nums.length && j < target.length) {
            if (nums[i] == target[j]) {
                i++;
                j++;
            } else if (nums[i] < target[j]) {
                i++;
                operations++;
            } else {
                j++;
                operations++;
            }
        }
        
        operations += (nums.length - i) + (target.length - j);

        return operations;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumOperationsToMakeArraysSimilar solution = new MinimumOperationsToMakeArraysSimilar();
        int[] nums1 = {1, 3, 5, 4};
        int[] target1 = {1, 4, 5, 6};

        System.out.println(solution.minOperations(nums1, target1)); // Output based on input arrays
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: Sorting both arrays `nums` and `target` takes \(O(n \log n)\) where `n` is the length of the arrays.
- **Linear Scan**: The while loop runs in \(O(n)\).

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

### Summary

The approach involves sorting both arrays and then counting the mismatches to determine the number of operations required to make the arrays similar. This method ensures that we efficiently minimize the operations using sorting and linear traversal.
