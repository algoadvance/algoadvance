[Leetcode 622. Design Circular Queue](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l622)
## Problem Statement

Design your implementation of the circular queue. The circular queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle, and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also called “Ring Buffer”.

One of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the spaces in front of the queue. In a normal queue, once the queue becomes full, we cannot insert the next element even if there is a space in front of the queue. But using the circular queue, we can use the space to store new values.

Your implementation should support following operations:

- `MyCircularQueue(k)`: Constructor, set the size of the queue to be k.
- `Front`: Get the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
- `Rear`: Get the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
- `enQueue(value)`: Insert an element into the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.
- `deQueue`: Delete an element from the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.
- `isEmpty`: Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not.
- `isFull`: Checks whether the circular queue is full or not.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the elements in the queue be non-integer values?
   - For the purpose of this problem, we will assume the queue holds integer values.
2. Do we need to handle concurrency?
   - No, assume all operations are performed sequentially.
3. Should we perform input validation for the methods?
   - Assume valid inputs (e.g., `enQueue` will only receive integer values).

## Strategy

1. Use an array to store the elements of the queue.
2. Maintain two pointers, `front` and `rear`, to indicate the start and end of the queue.
3. Keep a count of the current number of elements in the queue to determine when it's full or empty.

### Methods:
- **Constructor (`MyCircularQueue`)**: Initialize the queue array and pointers.
- **`enQueue`**: Add an element at the `rear` and update the rear pointer and count.
- **`deQueue`**: Remove an element from the `front` and update the front pointer and count.
- **`Front`**: Return the element at the `front` if not empty.
- **`Rear`**: Return the element just before the `rear` if not empty.
- **`isEmpty`**: Check if count is zero.
- **`isFull`**: Check if count equals the queue size.

## Time Complexity

- Constructor: O(1)
- `enQueue`: O(1)
- `deQueue`: O(1)
- `Front`: O(1)
- `Rear`: O(1)
- `isEmpty`: O(1)
- `isFull`: O(1)

Let's implement this:

## Code

```java
public class MyCircularQueue {
    private int[] queue;
    private int front;
    private int rear;
    private int count;
    private int capacity;

    public MyCircularQueue(int k) {
        this.capacity = k;
        this.queue = new int[capacity];
        this.front = 0;
        this.rear = 0;
        this.count = 0;
    }
    
    public boolean enQueue(int value) {
        if (isFull()) return false;
        queue[rear] = value;
        rear = (rear + 1) % capacity;
        count++;
        return true;
    }
    
    public boolean deQueue() {
        if (isEmpty()) return false;
        front = (front + 1) % capacity;
        count--;
        return true;
    }
    
    public int Front() {
        if (isEmpty()) return -1;
        return queue[front];
    }
    
    public int Rear() {
        if (isEmpty()) return -1;
        return queue[(rear - 1 + capacity) % capacity];
    }
    
    public boolean isEmpty() {
        return count == 0;
    }
    
    public boolean isFull() {
        return count == capacity;
    }
}
```

This code covers all the required operations for the circular queue with time complexities as mentioned.
