[Leetcode 1346. Check If N and Its Double Exist](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1346)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `arr` of integers, check if there exist two indices i and j such that:
- `i != j`
- `0 <= i, j < arr.length`
- `arr[i] == 2 * arr[j]`

Return `true` if such elements exist, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the elements of the array positive or negative?**
   - They can be both positive and negative integers.
   
2. **What should be returned if the array is empty or contains one element?**
   - If the array is empty or contains one element, return `false`.

3. **Is there any constraint on the size of the array?**
   - Typical constraints as per competitive programming context, assume `1 <= arr.length <= 500`.

### Strategy

1. **Using a Hash Set for O(n) time complexity:**
   - Use a hash set to keep track of the visited numbers.
   - Iterate through the array and for each element `x`:
     - Check if `x * 2` or `x / 2` (only if `x` is even) exists in the set.
     - If found, return `true`.
     - Otherwise, add `x` to the set.
   - If no such pair is found, return `false`.

This approach ensures we check every possible pair in linear time, making it efficient.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashSet;

public class Solution {
    public boolean checkIfExist(int[] arr) {
        HashSet<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (int num : arr) {
            if (seen.contains(num * 2) || (num % 2 == 0 && seen.contains(num / 2))) {
                return true;
            }
            seen.add(num);
        }
        
        return false;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - We traverse the array once, and each operation with the hash set (check contains and add) is O(1) on average.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - In the worst case, we store all elements in the hash set.

This solution is efficient both in terms of time and space, making it suitable for the given constraints.
