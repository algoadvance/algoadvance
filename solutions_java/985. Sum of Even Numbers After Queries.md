[Leetcode 985. Sum of Even Numbers After Queries](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l985)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` and an array `queries` where `queries[i] = [val, index]`. For each query, apply `val` to `nums[index]`. After each application, you need to find the sum of the even numbers in the array and return the result as an array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints on `nums` and `queries`:**
   - What is the length range of `nums` and `queries`?
   - What are the possible values for elements in `nums` and `queries`?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should be done if `nums[index]` is already an even number? Should it be incremented or replaced by val?
   - How do we handle negative values in `nums` and `queries`?

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] sumEvenAfterQueries(int[] nums, int[][] queries) {
        int sumEven = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num % 2 == 0) {
                sumEven += num;
            }
        }

        int[] result = new int[queries.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < queries.length; i++) {
            int val = queries[i][0];        // Value to add
            int index = queries[i][1];      // Index to apply the value

            if (nums[index] % 2 == 0) {
                sumEven -= nums[index];
            }

            nums[index] += val;

            if (nums[index] % 2 == 0) {
                sumEven += nums[index];
            }

            result[i] = sumEven;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Strategy
1. **Initial Even Sum Calculation:**
   - Compute the initial sum of even numbers in `nums`.

2. **Processing Each Query:**
   - For each query, update the value at the specified index.
   - Adjust the sum of even numbers accordingly:
     - If the original value was even, subtract it from `sumEven`.
     - After updating the value, if the new value is even, add it to `sumEven`.

3. **Return Results:**
   - Store the updated sum of even numbers after each query and return this array as the result.

### Time Complexity
- **Initial Sum Calculation:** \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of `nums`.
- **Query Processing:** \(O(m)\) where \(m\) is the number of queries.
  
Because both operations are independent, the overall time complexity is \(O(n + m)\). This is efficient given the typical constraints of competitive programming problems.
