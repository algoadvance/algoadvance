[Leetcode 2544. Alternating Digit Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2544)
### Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer `n`. Each digit of `n` has a sign according to its position:
- The digit at the odd positions has a positive sign.
- The digit at the even positions has a negative sign.

You need to return the sum of all digits with their corresponding sign.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the maximum value of `n`? (This will help determine if we need to consider integer overflow or not)
2. **Output**: Should we verify that `n` is always a positive integer greater than 0 and contains only digits?

Assuming reasonable constraints, we will proceed.

### Example

For example, if `n = 521`, the result should be `5 - 2 + 1 = 4`.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Track the sum by initializing a variable, say `sum`, to 0.
2. **Iteration**: Convert the number to a string to access each digit's position easily.
3. **Sign Determination**: Iterate over each character in the string representation of the number:
   - If the position is odd (0-indexed even), add the digit to the sum.
   - If the position is even (0-indexed odd), subtract the digit from the sum.
4. **Result**: Return the final value of the sum.

### Code

Here's the Java implementation to solve the problem:

```java
public class AlternatingDigitSum {
    public static int alternateDigitSum(int n) {
        String s = Integer.toString(n);
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            int digit = Character.getNumericValue(s.charAt(i));
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                // Odd position (1-based)
                sum += digit;
            } else {
                // Even position (1-based)
                sum -= digit;
            }
        }
        return sum;
    }

    // Example usage
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 521;
        System.out.println("Alternating Digit Sum of " + n + " is: " + alternateDigitSum(n)); // Output: 4
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(d)`, where `d` is the number of digits in `n`. This is because we iterate over each digit exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` if we ignore the space used for the input string conversion and the result storage. If we consider the input string, it will be `O(d)`.

This solution efficiently calculates the alternating digit sum based on given constraints.
