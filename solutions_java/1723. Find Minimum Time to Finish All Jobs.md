[Leetcode 1723. Find Minimum Time to Finish All Jobs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1723)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `jobs`, where `jobs[i]` is the amount of time it takes to complete the i-th job. There are `k` workers. You want to finish all the jobs as soon as possible under the constraint that a worker can only work on one job at a time. 

Return the minimum time needed to finish all the jobs.

### Example:
- Input: `jobs = [3, 2, 3], k = 3`
- Output: `3`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the jobs indivisible?**
   Yes, each job must be completed by a single worker.

2. **Can we assume all input values, like the lengths of jobs and the value of k, fit within standard limits?**
   Yes, you can assume the problem constraints adhere to 1 <= jobs.length <= 12 and 1 <= jobs[i] <= 10^7.

3. **Can we assume that 1 <= k <= 12?**
   Yes, based on typical constraints for such problems.

### Strategy
1. **Binary Search + Backtracking**
   - Use binary search to determine the minimum possible time required to complete all jobs.
   - Use backtracking to verify if it's feasible to distribute jobs among workers within a given maximum time frame.

2. **Steps:**
   - Sort the jobs in descending order (this can optimize our backtracking by trying to assign larger jobs first).
   - Binary search on possible maximum times (`low` starts at the max job time, `high` is the sum of all job times).
   - For each mid-value in the binary search, use backtracking to see if it's possible to assign all jobs within that maximum time.

### Code
Hereâ€™s the code implementing the above strategy:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int minimumTimeRequired(int[] jobs, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(jobs);
        int low = jobs[jobs.length - 1];
        int high = Arrays.stream(jobs).sum();
        int result = high;
        
        // Binary search on the answer
        while (low <= high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (canFinish(jobs, k, mid)) {
                result = mid;
                high = mid - 1;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
    
    private boolean canFinish(int[] jobs, int k, int maxTime) {
        int[] workloads = new int[k];
        return canAssign(jobs, jobs.length - 1, workloads, maxTime);
    }
    
    private boolean canAssign(int[] jobs, int jobIndex, int[] workloads, int maxTime) {
        if (jobIndex < 0) {
            return true;
        }
        
        int job = jobs[jobIndex];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < workloads.length; i++) {
            if (workloads[i] + job <= maxTime) {
                workloads[i] += job;
                if (canAssign(jobs, jobIndex - 1, workloads, maxTime)) {
                    return true;
                }
                workloads[i] -= job;
            }
            if (workloads[i] == 0) {
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] jobs = {3, 2, 3};
        int k = 3;
        System.out.println(solution.minimumTimeRequired(jobs, k));
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Binary Search Time Complexity:** O(log(sum of jobs) - max job).
- **Backtracking Time Complexity:** In the worst case, every assignment can be tried, which is O(k^m) where m is number of jobs.

**Combined Time Complexity:** This is O(log(sum of jobs) - max job) multiplied by the backtracking complexity O(k^m). Given m and k are relatively small (both up to 12), this approach is efficient enough for the problem constraints.
