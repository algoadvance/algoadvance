[Leetcode 386. Lexicographical Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l386)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, return `1 - n` in lexicographical order.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: 13
Output: [1,10,11,12,13,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of integer `n`?**
   - Typically this would be specified in the problem. Assuming constraints typical for such problems, it might go up to \(10^5\).

2. **Are there any specific constraints or performance requirements?**
   - The goal here would be to generate the sequence in lexicographical order efficiently without sorting. 

3. **Is there a specific requirement on the method signature?**
   - Typically, it would look like `public List<Integer> lexicalOrder(int n)`.

## Strategy

### Approach

To achieve lexicographical order without sorting, a good approach is to utilize Depth-First Search (DFS). Starting from `1` and moving forward by always trying to append the next digit:

1. Start from `1` and go as deep as possible before incrementing the prefix.
2. If the current number x can append another digit without exceeding `n`, recurse into x*10.
3. If the current number x is less than `n` and not ending with a `9` (allows the next increment), increment x by `1`.

### Steps

1. Initialize an empty list to hold the result.
2. Iterate through the base numbers from `1` to `9` and perform a DFS on each.
3. In each DFS iteration:
   - Add the current number to the list.
   - Try to generate the next number by appending digits until it exceeds `n`.

### Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class LexicographicalNumbers {

    public List<Integer> lexicalOrder(int n) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++) {
            dfs(i, n, result);
        }
        return result;
    }

    private void dfs(int current, int n, List<Integer> result) {
        if (current > n) {
            return;
        }
        result.add(current);
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            if (10 * current + i > n) {
                return;
            }
            dfs(10 * current + i, n, result);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LexicographicalNumbers lexiNumbers = new LexicographicalNumbers();
        int n = 13;
        System.out.println(lexiNumbers.lexicalOrder(n));  // Output: [1, 10, 11, 12, 13, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
  - Each number from `1` to `n` is visited exactly once, resulting in an \(O(n)\) complexity.
  
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
  - The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) due to the storage used for the result list. The recursive DFS stack could go as deep as the number of digits in `n`. Hence, for `n` up to \(10^5\), the stack depth would handle up to 5 levels.

This solution provides an efficient way to generate numbers in lexicographical order without the need to sort them explicitly.
