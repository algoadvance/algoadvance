[Leetcode 1155. Number of Dice Rolls With Target Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1155)
### Problem Statement

Given `n` dice each with `k` faces numbered from `1` to `k`, return the number of possible ways to get a sum equal to `target`. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints:**
   - `1 <= n <= 30`
   - `1 <= k <= 30`
   - `1 <= target <= 1000`
2. **Are there any special conditions for the dice faces?**
   - No, each face of the dice is numbered from `1` to `k`.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - We can use a 2D DP array `dp[i][j]` where `i` represents the number of dice and `j` represents the sum we are trying to get with those dice.
   - `dp[i][j]` will store the number of ways to achieve sum `j` with `i` dice.
   - The recurrence relation will be:
     - `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j-2] + ... + dp[i-1][j-k]`
     - This means the ways to get `j` with `i` dice is the sum of the ways to get `j-f` with `i-1` dice for all faces `f` from `1` to `k`.
   - Initialize `dp[0][0] = 1` because there is exactly one way to get the sum of 0 with 0 dice.
   - The result will be `dp[n][target]`.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this DP approach is `O(n * target * k)` because we fill a table of size `n x target` and for each cell, we might do up to `k` additions.
- The space complexity is `O(n * target)` for the DP table.

### Code

```java
public class NumberOfDiceRolls {
    public int numRollsToTarget(int n, int k, int target) {
        int MOD = 1000000007;
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][target + 1];
        
        dp[0][0] = 1; // There's one way to get sum 0 with 0 dice.
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= target; j++) {
                for (int face = 1; face <= k; face++) {
                    if (j - face >= 0) {
                        dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - 1][j - face]) % MOD;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n][target];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NumberOfDiceRolls solution = new NumberOfDiceRolls();
        System.out.println(solution.numRollsToTarget(1, 6, 3));  // Output: 1
        System.out.println(solution.numRollsToTarget(2, 6, 7));  // Output: 6
        System.out.println(solution.numRollsToTarget(2, 5, 10)); // Output: 1
        System.out.println(solution.numRollsToTarget(1, 2, 3));  // Output: 0
    }
}
```

This code initializes the dynamic programming table and fills it using the recurrence relation explained. The result is the value in `dp[n][target]`.
