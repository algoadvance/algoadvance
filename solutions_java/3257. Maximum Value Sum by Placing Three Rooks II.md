[Leetcode 3257. Maximum Value Sum by Placing Three Rooks II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3257)
## Problem Statement

You are given a `n x n` chessboard with each cell containing a numerical value. Your task is to place three rooks on the board such that the sum of the values in the cells where the rooks are placed is maximized. Note that rooks can only attack in straight lines horizontally and vertically, and no two rooks can share the same row or column.

Write a function `maxSumWithThreeRooks` to calculate the maximum possible sum.

### Example:
```java
Input: 
board = [
  [5, 1, 6, 7],
  [3, 8, 2, 4],
  [9, 4, 3, 8],
  [1, 7, 4, 2]
]
Output: 23
```
In this example, placing the rooks at positions (0, 3), (2, 0), and (1, 1) give the maximum sum of 7 + 9 + 8 = 24.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the values in the cells guaranteed to be positive?
    - No, the values can be positive, negative, or zero.
2. Is the board always square (i.e., n x n)?
    - Yes, the board is always a square.
3. What should the function return if `n < 3`?
    - Since it's not possible to place three rooks in this case, the function should return an appropriate value, such as 0 or throw an exception.

## Strategy

1. **Brute Force:** Checking every combination to place the rooks across different rows and columns would lead to a time complexity of `O(n^3)`, where n is the size of the chessboard. We should look for more efficient ways to reduce the complexity.
2. **Greedy/Bipartite Matching:** Going through each possible triplet for rows and columns, we would still achieve a linear approach if handled correctly.
3. **Dynamic Programming:** Can be explored but must ensure complexity is reduced appropriately.

For this solution, I will implement an approach focusing on checking triplets of rows and columns efficiently.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    
    public int maxSumWithThreeRooks(int[][] board) {
        int n = board.length;
        if (n < 3) {
            return 0; // Cannot place 3 rooks if there are less than 3 rows or columns
        }
        
        int maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        // Try every combination of three different rows
        for (int r1 = 0; r1 < n - 2; r1++) {
            for (int r2 = r1 + 1; r2 < n - 1; r2++) {
                for (int r3 = r2 + 1; r3 < n; r3++) {
                    // Try every combination of three different columns
                    for (int c1 = 0; c1 < n - 2; c1++) {
                        for (int c2 = c1 + 1; c2 < n - 1; c2++) {
                            for (int c3 = c2 + 1; c3 < n; c3++) {
                                int sum = board[r1][c1] + board[r2][c2] + board[r3][c3];
                                maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, sum);
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return maxSum;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[][] board = {
            {5, 1, 6, 7},
            {3, 8, 2, 4},
            {9, 4, 3, 8},
            {1, 7, 4, 2}
        };
        System.out.println(solution.maxSumWithThreeRooks(board)); // Output: 24
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity is `O(n^6)` due to the nested loops iterating over the combinations of rows and columns. For smaller values of `n` (like 4 or 5), this can be acceptable, but for larger values of `n`, optimizations are essential. Reducing complexity through dynamic programming or other strategies might be necessary for efficiency with larger boards.
