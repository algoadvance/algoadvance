[Leetcode 1627. Graph Connectivity With Threshold](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1627)
### Problem Statement

Given a graph with `n` nodes and several edges. You are given an integer `threshold` and an array `queries`, where each `queries[i] = [u_i, v_i]` - a query to check with node `u_i` and node `v_i` are connected. More formally, node `u_i` and node `v_i` are connected if there exists a path of edges between `u_i` and `v_i`. An edge between node `a` and node `b` exists if `gcd(a, b) > threshold`, where `gcd(a, b)` is the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of input values**: What are the ranges for `n`, `threshold`, and the elements inside `queries`?
2. **Return type**: Should the result be a list of booleans indicating if each query's nodes are connected?
3. **Special values**: Should we handle any special cases differently, such as when `n` or `threshold` is zero?

### Strategy

To approach this problem, we will:
1. **Use Disjoint Set (Union-Find)**: We will employ a Disjoint Set (Union-Find) data structure to solve the connectivity problem efficiently.
2. **Filter edges using GCD**: For each pair of nodes, we add an edge if their GCD is greater than the threshold.
3. **Process Queries**: After constructing the graph, we'll answer the connectivity queries using the Union-Find structure.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class GraphConnectivityWithThreshold {
    
    class UnionFind {
        private int[] parent;
        private int[] rank;

        public UnionFind(int n) {
            parent = new int[n + 1];
            rank = new int[n + 1];
            for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
                parent[i] = i;
            }
        }

        public int find(int x) {
            if (parent[x] != x) {
                parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
            }
            return parent[x];
        }

        public void union(int x, int y) {
            int rootX = find(x);
            int rootY = find(y);

            if (rootX != rootY) {
                if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]) {
                    parent[rootY] = rootX;
                } else if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]) {
                    parent[rootX] = rootY;
                } else {
                    parent[rootY] = rootX;
                    rank[rootX]++;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    public List<Boolean> areConnected(int n, int threshold, int[][] queries) {
        UnionFind uf = new UnionFind(n);
      
        for (int i = threshold + 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 2 * i; j <= n; j += i) {
                uf.union(i, j);
            }
        }

        List<Boolean> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int[] query : queries) {
            result.add(uf.find(query[0]) == uf.find(query[1]));
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        GraphConnectivityWithThreshold graph = new GraphConnectivityWithThreshold();
        
        int n = 6;
        int threshold = 2;
        int[][] queries = // use example from above
        
        System.out.println(graph.areConnected(n, threshold, queries)); // Output: [false, false, true]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Building Union-Find**: O(n log(n))
  - For each multiple `j` starting from `i = threshold + 1`, unify `i` and `j`, resulting in approximately `log(n)` merges.
- **Processing Queries**: O(k α(n)), where `k` is the number of queries and `α` is the inverse Ackermann function from Union-Find operations.
   
Overall, the time complexity is dominated by `O(n log(n))`.

### Space Complexity

- **Union-Find storage**: O(n) for storing the parent and rank arrays.
- **Additional space**: O(k) for the result list.

Thus, the overall space complexity is O(n + k).
