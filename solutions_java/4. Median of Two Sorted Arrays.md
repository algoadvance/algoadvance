[Leetcode 4. Median of Two Sorted Arrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l4)
### Problem Statement

The problem is to find the median of the two sorted arrays. The combined size of the arrays will always be even.

#### LeetCode Problem:
Given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2 of size m and n respectively, return the median of the two sorted arrays.

You may assume nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.

#### Example:
```
Input: nums1 = [1, 3], nums2 = [2]
Output: 2.00000

Input: nums1 = [1, 2], nums2 = [3, 4]
Output: 2.50000
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the arrays be empty?**
   - No, you may assume that nums1 and nums2 cannot be both empty.

2. **Should we handle cases where an array is significantly larger than the other?**
   - Yes, the solution should handle arrays of different sizes efficiently.

3. **Do the arrays always contain integers, or is there a possibility of other types?**
   - For the scope of this problem, assume the arrays contain integers.

4. **What should be the method signature?**
   - The method signature should be `public double findMedianSortedArrays(int[] nums1, int[] nums2)`.

### Strategy

1. **Complexity constraints**:
   - A brute-force method that involves merging the arrays and then finding the median would have a time complexity of O(m + n). However, we aim to achieve a solution with O(log(min(m, n))) complexity using binary search.

2. **Binary Search Approach**:
   - Since the arrays are already sorted, we can employ a binary search strategy to find the partition point.
   - Partition both arrays around the median point and adjust iteratively until the correct partition is achieved.
   - The idea is to use binary search on the smaller array to reduce complexity.

### Code

Here is the Java code for the solution:

```java
public class Solution {
    public double findMedianSortedArrays(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        if (nums1.length > nums2.length) {
            // Ensure nums1 is the smaller array
            return findMedianSortedArrays(nums2, nums1);
        }
        
        int x = nums1.length;
        int y = nums2.length;
        int low = 0;
        int high = x;
        
        while (low <= high) {
            int partitionX = (low + high) / 2;
            int partitionY = (x + y + 1) / 2 - partitionX;
            
            int maxX = (partitionX == 0) ? Integer.MIN_VALUE : nums1[partitionX - 1];
            int minX = (partitionX == x) ? Integer.MAX_VALUE : nums1[partitionX];
            int maxY = (partitionY == 0) ? Integer.MIN_VALUE : nums2[partitionY - 1];
            int minY = (partitionY == y) ? Integer.MAX_VALUE : nums2[partitionY];
            
            if (maxX <= minY && maxY <= minX) {
                // We have partitioned correctly
                if ((x + y) % 2 == 0) {
                    // If combined length is even
                    return ((double)Math.max(maxX, maxY) + Math.min(minX, minY)) / 2;
                } else {
                    // If combined length is odd
                    return (double)Math.max(maxX, maxY);
                }
            } else if (maxX > minY) {
                // We are too far on the right side for partitionX, move left
                high = partitionX - 1;
            } else {
                // We are too far on the left side for partitionX, move right
                low = partitionX + 1;
            }
        }
        
        // Only reach here if there is an input error
        throw new IllegalArgumentException();
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is **O(log(min(m, n)))**, where \`m\` and \`n\` are the lengths of the two input arrays.
- The space complexity is **O(1)** since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This solution achieves the desired efficiency and leverages the sorted nature of the input arrays for an optimal approach using binary search.
