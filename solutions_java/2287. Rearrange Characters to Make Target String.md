[Leetcode 2287. Rearrange Characters to Make Target String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2287)
### Problem Statement

You are given two strings: `s` and `target`. You are supposed to rearrange the characters of `s` to create as many target strings as possible.

### Example:
```
Input: s = "ilovecodingonleetcode", target = "code"
Output: 2
Explanation: You can create two "code" strings from the given string.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Case Sensitivity**: Are the strings `s` and `target` case-sensitive?
   - **Assumption**: Yes, they are case-sensitive.
2. **Allowed Characters**: Are there any constraints on the type of characters in `s` and `target`?
   - **Assumption**: Both strings can contain only lowercase English letters.
3. **String Length**: Are there any constraints on the lengths of `s` and `target`?
   - **Assumption**: Both `s` and `target` have a length between 1 and 1000.

### Strategy
To determine the number of times we can rearrange the characters of `s` to create the `target` string:
1. **Count Frequencies**: First, we need to count the frequency of each character in both `s` and `target`.
2. **Divide and Conquer**: For each character in `target`, check how many times it can appear given the counts in `s`.
3. **Determine the Minimum**: The minimum number across all required characters will give us the maximum number of `target` strings that can be formed.

### Code

Here's the implementation in Java:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class RearrangeCharacters {
    public int rearrangeCharacters(String s, String target) {
        // Frequency map for the characters in the string s
        HashMap<Character, Integer> sCount = new HashMap<>();
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            sCount.put(ch, sCount.getOrDefault(ch, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        // Frequency map for the characters in the target string
        HashMap<Character, Integer> targetCount = new HashMap<>();
        for (char ch : target.toCharArray()) {
            targetCount.put(ch, targetCount.getOrDefault(ch, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        // Calculate the maximum number of times we can form the target string
        int maxCount = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (char ch : targetCount.keySet()) {
            if (sCount.containsKey(ch)) {
                maxCount = Math.min(maxCount, sCount.get(ch) / targetCount.get(ch));
            } else {
                return 0; // If the character is not in s, we cannot form the target at all
            }
        }
        
        return maxCount;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RearrangeCharacters rc = new RearrangeCharacters();
        System.out.println(rc.rearrangeCharacters("ilovecodingonleetcode", "code")); // Output: 2
        System.out.println(rc.rearrangeCharacters("abcba", "abc")); // Output: 1
        System.out.println(rc.rearrangeCharacters("abbaccaddaeea", "aaaaa")); // Output: 1
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n + m), where `n` is the length of the string `s` and `m` is the length of the string `target`. This is because we iterate through each character of `s` and `target` only once to build the frequency maps and then process those maps.
