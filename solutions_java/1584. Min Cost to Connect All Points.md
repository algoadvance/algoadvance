[Leetcode 1584. Min Cost to Connect All Points](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1584)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `points` representing integer coordinates of some points on a 2D-plane, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`. The cost of connecting two points `[xi, yi]` and `[xj, yj]` is the Manhattan distance between them: `|xi - xj| + |yi - yj|`.

Return the minimum cost to make all points connected. All points are connected if there is exactly one simple path between any two points.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: What is the maximum number of points we can have?
   **A**: The constraints are `1 <= points.length <= 1000`, and each point's coordinates range from `-10^6` to `10^6`.

2. **Q**: Is it guaranteed that all points have distinct coordinates?
   **A**: Yes, all points are unique.

3. **Q**: Can the input size be sufficiently large to require optimization efforts?
   **A**: Yes, since the number of points can go up to 1000 and we might need to connect every pair in the worst case which leads to considerations for complexity.

## Strategy 

To solve the problem efficiently, a minimum spanning tree (MST) algorithm such as Prim's or Kruskal's can be used:

1. **Kruskal’s Algorithm**:
   - Generate all possible edges with their costs.
   - Sort edges based on cost.
   - Use a union-find data structure to add edges in increasing order of cost until all points are connected.
   
2. **Prim’s Algorithm**:
   - Start from an arbitrary point and expand the MST by adding the cheapest edge that connects a point in the MST to a point outside the MST.
   - Use a priority queue to always expand the MST with the smallest edge available.

Given there are up to 1000 points, Prim's algorithm is more suitable due to its efficiency in this context.

## Code

Here is a Java implementation using Prim's Algorithm:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MinCostConnectPoints {

    public int minCostConnectPoints(int[][] points) {
        int n = points.length;
        if (n == 1) return 0;

        // Priority queue to hold the edges based on cost
        PriorityQueue<Edge> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(e -> e.cost));
        // Start with the first point
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            pq.add(new Edge(0, i, distance(points, 0, i)));
        }
        
        boolean[] inMST = new boolean[n]; // tracks points already in MST
        inMST[0] = true;
        int totalCost = 0;
        int edgesUsed = 0;

        // Process edges until we use N-1 edges (forming the MST)
        while (edgesUsed < n - 1) {
            Edge edge = pq.poll();
            if (inMST[edge.point2]) continue; // Ignore if point is already in MST
            
            // Include this edge in MST
            totalCost += edge.cost;
            inMST[edge.point2] = true;
            edgesUsed++;
            
            // Add all edges from the newly included point to the priority queue
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (!inMST[i]) {
                    pq.add(new Edge(edge.point2, i, distance(points, edge.point2, i)));
                }
            }
        }

        return totalCost;
    }

    private int distance(int[][] points, int i, int j) {
        return Math.abs(points[i][0] - points[j][0]) + Math.abs(points[i][1] - points[j][1]);
    }

    private static class Edge {
        int point1, point2, cost;
        Edge(int point1, int point2, int cost) {
            this.point1 = point1;
            this.point2 = point2;
            this.cost = cost;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinCostConnectPoints solution = new MinCostConnectPoints();
        int[][] points = \ use example from above
        System.out.println(solution.minCostConnectPoints(points)); // Output: 20
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O((E + V) \log V)\), where \(E\) is the number of edges and \(V\) is the number of vertices. Here, \(V = n\) and \(E\) in the worst case can be \(n(n-1)/2\), so it simplifies to \(O(n^2 \log n)\). The main work is done by inserting/removing edges from the priority queue.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\) due to the priority queue storing edges.
