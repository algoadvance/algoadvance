[Leetcode 2259. Remove Digit From Number to Maximize Result](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2259)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `number` representing a positive integer and a character `digit`. You need to remove **one occurrence** of `digit` from `number` so that the resulting string is the **largest possible integer**. Return the resulting string as an integer in string format.

**Example:**
```
Input: number = "1231", digit = '1'
Output: "231"

Input: number = "551", digit = '5'
Output: "51"

Input: number = "123", digit = '3'
Output: "12"
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can there be multiple occurrences of `digit` in the `number`?**
   - Yes, but we need to remove only one occurrence to get the largest possible number.

2. **Can the input `number` contain leading zeros after removing the digit?**
   - The problem guarantees that `number` is a valid positive integer, so there won't be leading zeros.

3. **What should be done if removing any digit does not increase the number?**
   - Even if the number decreases, we need to remove one occurrence of the specified `digit`.

## Strategy

1. **Iterate through the `number`:**
   - Iterate through each character in the string `number`.
   
2. **Find Potential Candidates:**
   - Whenever we encounter the `digit`, consider the number formed by removing the current occurrence of `digit`.

3. **Determine the Maximum Possible Result:**
   - Track each possible number formed by removing one occurrence of `digit` and determine the maximum of these numbers.

4. **Implementation Details:**
   - Use a variable to store the maximum of these possible numbers as we iterate through the string.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public String removeDigit(String number, char digit) {
        String maxNumber = "";
        int length = number.length();

        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            if (number.charAt(i) == digit) {
                String candidate = number.substring(0, i) + number.substring(i + 1);
                if (maxNumber.isEmpty() || candidate.compareTo(maxNumber) > 0) {
                    maxNumber = candidate;
                }
            }
        }

        return maxNumber;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.removeDigit("1231", '1')); // Output: "231"
        System.out.println(sol.removeDigit("551", '5'));  // Output: "51"
        System.out.println(sol.removeDigit("123", '3'));  // Output: "12"
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - We iterate through the string `number` of length `n` once, performing substring operations which are O(n) in total. Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n).

- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - We are storing intermediate strings that are formed by removing one occurrence of `digit`. Hence, the space complexity is also O(n).
