[Leetcode 1695. Maximum Erasure Value](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1695)
### Problem Statement

**1695. Maximum Erasure Value**

You are given an array of positive integers `nums` and want to erase a subarray containing unique elements. The score you get by erasing the subarray is equal to the sum of its elements.

Return the maximum score you can get by erasing exactly one subarray.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: nums = [4,2,4,5,6]
Output: 17
Explanation: The optimal subarray here is [2,4,5,6].
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: What is the definition of a subarray in this context?
   - **A**: A subarray is a contiguous part of the original array.

2. **Q**: Can the array contain duplicate elements?
   - **A**: Yes, the array can contain duplicates, but the subarray should have all unique elements.

3. **Q**: Can the array be empty?
   - **A**: No, the problem guarantees a non-empty array of positive integers.

4. **Q**: What is the range of the integers in the array `nums`?
   - **A**: The integers are all positive.

### Strategy

We can use the sliding window technique combined with a hash set to keep track of elements in the current window. Here's the strategy:

1. Initialize two pointers, `start` and `end`, both set to the beginning of the array.
2. Use a hash set to keep track of unique elements in the current window.
3. Use a variable to keep track of the current sum of the elements in the window and another variable to track the maximum sum found.
4. Expand the `end` pointer to include new elements in the window:
   - If the element at `end` is unique (i.e., not in the hash set), add it to the current sum and update the hash set.
   - If the element at `end` is already in the hash set, move the `start` pointer to the right until the duplicate is removed.
5. After processing, return the maximum sum found.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class MaximumErasureValue {
    public int maximumUniqueSubarray(int[] nums) {
        int maxSum = 0, currentSum = 0;
        int start = 0;
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (int end = 0; end < nums.length; end++) {
            while (set.contains(nums[end])) {
                set.remove(nums[start]);
                currentSum -= nums[start];
                start++;
            }
            set.add(nums[end]);
            currentSum += nums[end];
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);
        }
        
        return maxSum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximumErasureValue sol = new MaximumErasureValue();
        int[] nums = {4, 2, 4, 5, 6};
        System.out.println(sol.maximumUniqueSubarray(nums));  // Output: 17
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The sliding window technique ensures that each element is processed at most twice (once when expanding the end and once when adjusting the start). Therefore, the time complexity is:

- **O(n)**: where `n` is the length of the array `nums`.

Space complexity:
- **O(n)**: for storing the hash set which in the worst case may contain all unique elements of the array.
