[Leetcode 327. Count of Range Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l327)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and two integers `lower` and `upper`, return the number of range sums that lie in `[lower, upper]` inclusive.

Range sum `S(i, j)` is defined as the sum of the elements in `nums` between indices `i` and `j` inclusive, where `i <= j`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the size range of the input array `nums`? 
   - Are there any constraints on the values of the elements in `nums`?
   
2. **Output:**
   - Should the result be returned as an integer count of valid range sums?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - How should the function behave for an empty array?
   - How should the function handle cases where `lower` is greater than `upper`?

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a combination of prefix sums and a modified merge sort algorithm to count the number of valid range sums. Here's an outline of the approach:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation:**
   - Compute the prefix sums of the array so that any range sum `S(i, j)` can be quickly derived using these prefix sums.
   
2. **Range Sum Counting via Merge Sort:**
   - Use a modified merge sort on the prefix sum array to count how many sums fall within the given `[lower, upper]` range. This helps in maintaining the sorted order and allows counting valid sums in an efficient manner.
   
### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int countRangeSum(int[] nums, int lower, int upper) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) return 0;

        long[] prefixSums = new long[nums.length + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            prefixSums[i + 1] = prefixSums[i] + nums[i];
        }

        return countWhileMerging(prefixSums, 0, prefixSums.length, lower, upper);
    }

    private int countWhileMerging(long[] sum, int start, int end, int lower, int upper) {
        if (end - start <= 1) return 0;
        int mid = (start + end) / 2;
        int count = countWhileMerging(sum, start, mid, lower, upper) + 
                    countWhileMerging(sum, mid, end, lower, upper);
        
        int j = mid, k = mid, t = mid;
        long[] cache = new long[end - start];
        int cacheCount = 0;
        
        for (int i = start; i < mid; i++) {
            while (k < end && sum[k] - sum[i] < lower) k++;
            while (j < end && sum[j] - sum[i] <= upper) j++;
            while (t < end && sum[t] < sum[i]) cache[cacheCount++] = sum[t++];
            cache[cacheCount++] = sum[i];

            count += j - k;
        }

        System.arraycopy(cache, 0, sum, start, t - start);

        return count;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Prefix Sum Calculation:** O(n)
- **Modified Merge Sort:**
  - The major operation is the merge sort which operates in O(n log n).
  - Counting the number of valid ranges takes an additional O(n log n) due to the nested loops in the merge function.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is O(n log n).

### Additional Notes:

- The merge sort helps not only in sorting but also in maintaining the count of valid range sums efficiently.
- The use of prefix sums allows us to derive any subarray sum in constant time, which is critical for solving this problem efficiently.
