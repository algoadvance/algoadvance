[Leetcode 2839. Check if Strings Can be Made Equal With Operations I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2839)
### Problem Statement
You are given two strings `s1` and `s2`, both of length n. You can perform the following operations on `s1` any number of times to obtain `s2`:

1. Swap any two even indexed characters of `s1`.
2. Swap any two odd indexed characters of `s1`.

Return `true` if you can obtain `s2` from `s1`. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the strings guaranteed to have the same length?**
   - Yes, the problem states that both strings `s1` and `s2` are of length `n`.
2. **What is the range of the length `n`?**
   - Usually, this would be detailed in the problem's constraints, but assume it is manageable within the usual constraints for string length in such problems.
3. **Are there any constraints on the characters within `s1` and `s2`?**
   - No specific constraints, assume they can consist of any ASCII characters.

### Strategy
The key insight is that you can only swap characters at even indices with other even indices and characters at odd indices with other odd indices. Therefore, for `s1` to be transformable into `s2`, the characters at even indices in `s1` should match the characters at even indices in `s2`, and similarly, the characters at odd indices in `s1` should match the characters at odd indices in `s2`.

**Steps:**
1. Separate the characters of `s1` and `s2` based on even-indexed and odd-indexed positions.
2. Sort both groups.
3. If the a sorted grouping of characters from `s1` matches with the corresponding grouping from `s2`, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

### Code
Hereâ€™s how you can implement the solution in Java:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public boolean canBeEqual(String s1, String s2) {
        // If the lengths are not the same, they can never be made equal
        if (s1.length() != s2.length()) {
            return false;
        }

        // Create arrays for even and odd indexed characters
        char[] s1Even = new char[s1.length() / 2 + s1.length() % 2];
        char[] s1Odd = new char[s1.length() / 2];
        char[] s2Even = new char[s1.length() / 2 + s1.length() % 2];
        char[] s2Odd = new char[s1.length() / 2];
        
        // Populate even and odd indexed characters
        int evenIndex = 0;
        int oddIndex = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s1.length(); i++) {
            if (i % 2 == 0) {
                s1Even[evenIndex] = s1.charAt(i);
                s2Even[evenIndex] = s2.charAt(i);
                evenIndex++;
            } else {
                s1Odd[oddIndex] = s1.charAt(i);
                s2Odd[oddIndex] = s2.charAt(i);
                oddIndex++;
            }
        }
        
        // Sort the arrays
        Arrays.sort(s1Even);
        Arrays.sort(s1Odd);
        Arrays.sort(s2Even);
        Arrays.sort(s2Odd);
        
        // Compare sorted arrays
        return Arrays.equals(s1Even, s2Even) && Arrays.equals(s1Odd, s2Odd);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.canBeEqual("abcd", "cdab")); // false
        System.out.println(solution.canBeEqual("abcd", "acdb")); // true
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is:

- O(n log n) for sorting the even-indexed and odd-indexed arrays.
- O(n) for populating and comparing the arrays.

Thus, the overall complexity is **O(n log n)**.
