[Leetcode 1855. Maximum Distance Between a Pair of Values](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1855)
### Problem Statement
Given two non-decreasing arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return the maximum distance `j - i` such that `0 <= i <= j < nums2.length` and `nums1[i] <= nums2[j]`.

### Clarifying Questions
Before diving into the solution, let's clarify some points:
1. Can the arrays be empty? In this case, return 0 as we cannot have any valid pair.
2. Are the arrays of the same length? No, `nums1` and `nums2` can have different lengths.
3. What are the expected maximum lengths for these arrays? This will help determine the efficiency requirements for our solution.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can take advantage of the non-decreasing order of both arrays. Here's the step-by-step approach:
1. Initialize two pointers, `i` for traversing `nums1` and `j` for traversing `nums2`. Each pointer starts from the beginning of its respective array.
2. Traverse through `nums1` with the pointer `i`, and for each value in `nums1`, find the furthest possible index `j` in `nums2` such that the value in `nums1` at `i` is less than or equal to the value in `nums2` at `j`.
3. Use a two-pointer approach to ensure we efficiently find the maximum distance `j - i`.
4. If the condition `nums1[i] <= nums2[j]` is met, calculate `j - i` and update the maximum distance if it's greater than the previously recorded distance.
5. Continue traversing until the end of either array is reached.

### Code
Here's the Java implementation of the above strategy:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxDistance(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        int maxDist = 0;
        
        while (i < nums1.length && j < nums2.length) {
            if (nums1[i] <= nums2[j]) {
                // Calculate the distance and update maxDist
                maxDist = Math.max(maxDist, j - i);
                j++;
            } else {
                // Move the pointer `i` to potentially find another match
                i++;
            }
        }
        
        return maxDist;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums1 = {2, 2, 2};
        int[] nums2 = {10, 10, 1};
        System.out.println(sol.maxDistance(nums1, nums2)); // Expected output: 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The algorithm traverses both arrays using two pointers in a single pass.
- Each pointer (`i` and `j`) moves forward at most once for each element in their respective arrays.
- This makes the time complexity O(max(m, n)), where `m` is the length of `nums1` and `n` is the length of `nums2`.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity of this solution is O(1) because we only use a constant amount of extra space for pointers and the maximum distance variable.

By this approach, we efficiently find the maximum distance satisfying the given conditions while taking advantage of the sorted nature of the input arrays.
