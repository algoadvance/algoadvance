[Leetcode 2577. Minimum Time to Visit a Cell In a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2577)
## Problem Statement

You are given a `m x n` grid `grid` where each cell has a non-negative integer representing the minimum time required to visit that cell. Initially, you are in the top-left cell `(0, 0)` and by visiting a cell `(i, j)`, it's only allowed to move to the neighboring cells either: up, down, left, or right. 

You need to determine the minimum time required to visit the bottom-right cell `(m-1, n-1)`.

The minimum time required is the maximum of the minimum times to visit the visited cells.

Formally, if `T(i, j)` denotes the minimum time to visit cell `(i, j)`, you are to return `T(m-1, n-1)`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all cells in the grid guaranteed to be accessible (i.e., there is always a path to reach `(m-1, n-1)` from `(0, 0)`)?**
   
2. **Can the grid contain cells with 0 as their minimum time?**

3. **What are the constraints on the size of the grid (m and n)?**

Let's assume typically large grids (as this affects the choice of algorithm).

## Strategy

To solve the problem, we can use a modified version of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm because the problem involves finding the path with the minimum maximum time required to reach any cell in the grid.

The steps involved will be:

1. **Initialization**: Use a priority queue (min-heap) to always expand the least cost cell.
2. **Process cells**: Continue processing until we reach the cell `(m-1, n-1)`.
3. **Update distances**: At each cell, push neighboring cells into the priority queue with an updated time to visit.

By always expanding the most accessible cell first (using the minimum time to visit), we ensure finding the shortest path which meets the criteria.

## Code

Here is the Java implementation:

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MinimumTimeToVisitCell {
    private static class Cell {
        int row, col, time;
        
        Cell(int row, int col, int time) {
            this.row = row;
            this.col = col;
            this.time = time;
        }
    }
    
    public int minTimeToVisitCell(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        
        // Directions array to move in 4 directions: right, left, down, up
        int[] dirX = {0, 0, 1, -1};
        int[] dirY = {1, -1, 0, 0};
        
        // Priority Queue to simulate Dijkstra's Algorithm
        PriorityQueue<Cell> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a.time - b.time);
        pq.offer(new Cell(0, 0, grid[0][0]));
        
        // Minimum time to reach each cell, initialized to infinity
        int[][] minTime = new int[m][n];
        for (int[] row : minTime) {
            Arrays.fill(row, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        }
        minTime[0][0] = grid[0][0];
        
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            Cell current = pq.poll();
            
            if (current.row == m - 1 && current.col == n - 1) {
                return current.time;
            }
            
            for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
                int newRow = current.row + dirX[i];
                int newCol = current.col + dirY[i];
                
                if (newRow >= 0 && newRow < m && newCol >= 0 && newCol < n) {
                    int newTime = Math.max(current.time, grid[newRow][newCol]);
                    
                    if (newTime < minTime[newRow][newCol]) {
                        minTime[newRow][newCol] = newTime;
                        pq.offer(new Cell(newRow, newCol, newTime));
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return -1;  // Unreachable; theoretically should not happen due to problem guarantees.
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is:

- **O(m * n log(m * n))** because we process each cell exactly once, and every cell operation in the priority queue operations costs log(m * n).

The space complexity is also:

- **O(m * n)** due to the additional data structures such as the priority queue and distance array.

This approach ensures we find the optimal path efficiently for reasonably large grid sizes.
