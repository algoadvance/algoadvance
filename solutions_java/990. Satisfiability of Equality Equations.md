[Leetcode 990. Satisfiability of Equality Equations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l990)
### Problem Statement

The problem "990. Satisfiability of Equality Equations" asks us to determine if it's possible to satisfy a list of equations that involve the equality and inequality of variables. The equations are given in the form of an array of strings, where each string is of length 4. Each string represents an equation in one of two forms:
- "a==b" indicating that variable `a` is equal to variable `b`
- "a!=b" indicating that variable `a` is not equal to variable `b`

Our task is to determine whether all the given equations can simultaneously be satisfied.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: 
   - What is the maximum length of the input array?
2. **Character Range**:
   - Do the variables only consist of lowercase English letters?
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Will there be input cases where the same variable appears in both equality and inequality equations?

### Strategy

We can use the Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU) data structure to solve this problem efficiently. The Union-Find structure helps in managing and merging disjoint sets and can help determine whether two elements belong to the same set.

#### Steps:

1. **Initial Setup**:
    - Initialize a parent array for Union-Find to manage the connected components.
2. **Process Equality Equations** (`a==b`):
    - Traverse all equality equations and perform union operations on the pairs of variables.
3. **Process Inequality Equations** (`a!=b`):
    - Traverse all inequality equations and check if the variables involved are in the same set. If they are, it means the equations contradict each other, and we return `false`.
4. **Final Check**:
    - If all checks pass, return `true` indicating that all equations can be satisfied.

### Code

Here is the Java implementation of the above strategy:

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean equationsPossible(String[] equations) {
        int[] parent = new int[26];
        
        // Initialize the parent array
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            parent[i] = i;
        }
        
        // Function to find the root of a variable
        int find(int x) {
            if (parent[x] != x) {
                parent[x] = find(parent[x]);  // Path compression
            }
            return parent[x];
        }
        
        // Function to union two variables
        void union(int x, int y) {
            int rootX = find(x);
            int rootY = find(y);
            if (rootX != rootY) {
                parent[rootX] = rootY;
            }
        }
        
        // First pass: process all equality equations
        for (String eq : equations) {
            if (eq.charAt(1) == '=') {
                int var1 = eq.charAt(0) - 'a';
                int var2 = eq.charAt(3) - 'a';
                union(var1, var2);
            }
        }
        
        // Second pass: check all inequality equations
        for (String eq : equations) {
            if (eq.charAt(1) == '!') {
                int var1 = eq.charAt(0) - 'a';
                int var2 = eq.charAt(3) - 'a';
                if (find(var1) == find(var2)) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}

```

### Time Complexity

- **Union-find operations** (find and union) are nearly constant time, amortized by the use of path compression and union by rank.
- **First pass**: We iterate over each equation once, performing union operations.
- **Second pass**: We iterate over each equation again, performing find operations.

Hence, the time complexity is approximately \( O(N) \), where \( N \) is the number of equations.

### Space Complexity

- We use an array of size 26 for the Union-Find structure, which makes the space complexity \( O(1) \) since the size is fixed at 26.
