[Leetcode 1834. Single](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1834)
### Problem Statement

You are given `n` tasks labeled from `0` to `n - 1` represented by a 2D integer array `tasks`, where `tasks[i] = [enqueueTimei, processingTimei]` means that the `i`-th task will be available to process at `enqueueTimei` and will take `processingTimei` to process.

You have a single-threaded CPU that can process at most one task at a time and will act in the following way:
1. If the CPU is idle and there are no available tasks, the CPU stays idle.
2. If the CPU is idle and there are available tasks, the CPU will choose the one with the smallest `processingTime`. If multiple tasks have the same `processingTime`, it will choose the task with the smallest index.
3. Once a task starts, the CPU will process the entire task without stopping.
4. The CPU can manage tasks that arrive while it is processing another task.

Return the order in which the CPU will process the tasks.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the enqueue times for tasks always sorted?**  
   No, they may not be sorted.
   
2. **Can multiple tasks have the same enqueue time and processing time?**  
   Yes, it is possible.
 
3. **What is the constraint on the number of tasks and their times?**  
   Constraints are as follows:
   - `1 <= tasks.length <= 10^5`
   - `1 <= enqueueTimei, processingTimei <= 10^9`

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can:
1. Use a priority queue (min-heap) to manage the current available tasks based on their `processingTime` and then by their index if the `processingTime` is the same.
2. Sort the tasks based on their `enqueueTime`.
3. Use a pointer to track the next task to be enqueued.
4. Simulate the processing of tasks:
   - If the CPU is idle and no tasks are in the heap, move time to the next enqueue time.
   - If the CPU is idle and tasks are in the heap, process the task with the smallest processing time.
   - Advance the current time by the `processingTime`.
   - Add new tasks that have become available during this processing time to the heap.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int[] getOrder(int[][] tasks) {
        int n = tasks.length;
        int[][] sortedTasks = new int[n][3];
        
        // Attach index to tasks array and sort them
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sortedTasks[i][0] = tasks[i][0];
            sortedTasks[i][1] = tasks[i][1];
            sortedTasks[i][2] = i;
        }
        
        Arrays.sort(sortedTasks, Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[0]));
        
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(
            (a, b) -> a[1] == b[1] ? Integer.compare(a[2], b[2]) : Integer.compare(a[1], b[1])
        );
        
        int time = 0, taskIndex = 0;
        int[] result = new int[n];
        int resultIndex = 0;
        
        while (taskIndex < n || !pq.isEmpty()) {
            if (pq.isEmpty() && time < sortedTasks[taskIndex][0]) {
                time = sortedTasks[taskIndex][0];
            }
            
            while (taskIndex < n && sortedTasks[taskIndex][0] <= time) {
                pq.add(new int[]{sortedTasks[taskIndex][0], sortedTasks[taskIndex][1], sortedTasks[taskIndex][2]});
                taskIndex++;
            }
            
            if (!pq.isEmpty()) {
                int[] curTask = pq.poll();
                time += curTask[1];
                result[resultIndex++] = curTask[2];
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the tasks** takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Processing each task** takes \(O(\log n)\) per operation due to the priority queue operations. Since we process each task once, this adds up to \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Overall Time Complexity** is \(O(n \log n)\) due to sorting and processing with the priority queue.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of tasks, mainly for storing the sorted tasks and the priority queue.
