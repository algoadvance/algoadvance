[Leetcode 406. Queue Reconstruction by Height](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l406)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of people, where `people[i] = [hi, ki]` represents the `ith` person having a height of `hi` and exactly `ki` other people in front of them who have a height greater than or equal to `hi`.

Reconstruct and return the queue that is represented by the input array `people`. The returned queue should be formatted as an array `queue`, where `queue[j] = [hj, kj]` is the attributes of the `jth` person in the queue.

### Example
**Input:** `people = [[7,0],[4,4],[7,1],[5,0],[6,1],[5,2]]`
**Output:** `[[5,0],[7,0],[5,2],[6,1],[4,4],[7,1]]`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: Can there be people with the same height and k-value?**
   - A: Yes.

2. **Q: Do the input arrays always contain valid persons?**
   - A: Yes. Assume all input is valid as per the problem description.

3. **Q: Is the input guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - A: Yes.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we'll use a greedy approach by performing the following steps:
1. **Sort** the array of people. First, sort by height in descending order. If two people have the same height, sort them by the number of people in front of them (`k`) in ascending order.
2. **Reconstruct** the queue by inserting each person into a new list at the index equal to their `k` value.

### Steps
1. **Sort**: Sort the array `people` using a custom comparator.
2. **Insert**: Insert each person into the result list according to their `k` value.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int[][] reconstructQueue(int[][] people) {
        // Sort with custom comparator
        // First by height in descending and then by k value in ascending
        Arrays.sort(people, (a, b) -> {
            if (a[0] != b[0]) {
                return b[0] - a[0];
            } else {
                return a[1] - b[1];
            }
        });
        
        // Reconstruct the queue
        List<int[]> result = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int[] person : people) {
            result.add(person[1], person);
        }
        
        // Convert list to array
        return result.toArray(new int[people.length][2]);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Insertion**: The insertion step takes \(O(n^2)\) in the worst case because inserting into a LinkedList at an index could be \(O(n)\) in the worst case, and we do this for all \(n\) people.

So, the overall time complexity is \(O(n^2)\).

### Space Complexity
- **Space**: The space complexity is \(O(n)\) for storing the intermediate list of people.

The approach ensures that the people are placed in the correct order, respecting both their height and the number of people in front of them, achieving the desired reconstruction of the queue.
