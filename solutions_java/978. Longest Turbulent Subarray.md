[Leetcode 978. Longest Turbulent Subarray](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l978)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `arr`, return the length of a maximum size turbulent subarray of `arr`.

A subarray is considered turbulent if the comparison sign flips between each adjacent pair of elements in the subarray.

More formally, a subarray `arr[i], arr[i + 1], ..., arr[j]` is turbulent if and only if for `i <= k < j`:
- `arr[k] > arr[k + 1]` when `k` is even, and
- `arr[k] < arr[k + 1]` when `k` is odd.

Or,
- `arr[k] < arr[k + 1]` when `k` is even, and
- `arr[k] > arr[k + 1]` when `k` is odd.

### Example:
1. Input: `arr = [9,4,2,10,7,8,8,1,9]`
    Output: `5`
    Explanation: The subarray `[4,2,10,7,8]` is turbulent.

2. Input: `arr = [4,8,12,16]`
   Output: `2`
   Explanation: The subarray `[4,8]` is turbulent.

3. Input: `arr = [100]`
   Output: `1`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are single-element arrays considered turbulent?**
   - Yes, a single element is trivially a turbulent subarray.

2. **Are there any constraints on the length of `arr` or the elements it contains?**
   - Constraints are typically:
     - `1 <= arr.length <= 4 * 10^4`
     - `0 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
    - If the array length is 1, directly return 1, as it is the only possible turbulent subarray.
    - Use two counters `inc` and `dec` to keep track of the length of turbulent subarrays where current pair is increasing or decreasing respectively.
    - Initialize `max_length` to 1.

2. **Iteration**:
    - Iterate through the array starting from the second element.
    - For each pair of consecutive elements `arr[i-1]` and `arr[i]`:
        - If `arr[i-1] < arr[i]`:
            - The current element is part of an increasing sequence.
            - Increment `inc` counter by 1 and reset `dec` counter to 1.
        - Else if `arr[i-1] > arr[i]`:
            - The current element is part of a decreasing sequence.
            - Increment `dec` counter by 1 and reset `inc` counter to 1.
        - Else:
            - Reset both counters since equal adjacent elements break the turbulent property.
    - Update `max_length` to the maximum of `max_length`, `inc`, and `dec`.

3. **Return result**:
    - After iterating through the array, return the value of `max_length`.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxTurbulenceSize(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        if (n == 1) {
            return 1;
        }

        int inc = 1, dec = 1, max_length = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > arr[i - 1]) {
                inc = dec + 1;
                dec = 1;
            } else if (arr[i] < arr[i - 1]) {
                dec = inc + 1;
                inc = 1;
            } else {
                inc = 1;
                dec = 1;
            }
            max_length = Math.max(max_length, Math.max(inc, dec));
        }

        return max_length;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` - We make a single pass through the array using a loop that iterates once for each element.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` - We only use a constant amount of extra space no matter the input size.

This solution efficiently computes the longest turbulent subarray while maintaining simplicity.
