[Leetcode 1342. Number of Steps to Reduce a Number to Zero](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1342)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer `num`, return the number of steps to reduce it to zero. In one step, if the current number is even, you have to divide it by 2; otherwise, you have to subtract 1 from it.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the input number be negative?
   **A:** No, the problem explicitly states that the number is a positive integer.

2. **Q:** Is there a maximum limit for the number?
   **A:** In general practice, we assume the number fits within the standard integer range (e.g., 32-bit signed integer).

3. **Q:** Should we handle special cases where the number is already zero?
   **A:** Yes, though if the number is zero, the number of steps is trivially zero.

## Strategy

1. We will use a loop to repeatedly modify the number until it reaches zero.
2. In each iteration, we check if the current number is even or odd:
   - If the number is even, divide it by 2.
   - If the number is odd, subtract 1 from it.
3. We will maintain a counter to keep track of the number of steps taken.
4. When the number becomes zero, the counter value will be our answer.

## Pseudocode

```
steps = 0
while num > 0:
    if num is even:
        num = num / 2
    else:
        num = num - 1
    steps = steps + 1
return steps
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(log N):
- Each division by 2 operation reduces the number in half, leading to O(log N) steps in the worst case.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int numberOfSteps(int num) {
        int steps = 0;
        
        while (num > 0) {
            if (num % 2 == 0) {
                num /= 2;
            } else {
                num -= 1;
            }
            steps++;
        }
        
        return steps;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.numberOfSteps(14)); // Output: 6
        System.out.println(sol.numberOfSteps(8));  // Output: 4
        System.out.println(sol.numberOfSteps(123)); // Output: 12
    }
}
```

This code provides a clean and efficient solution to the problem, handling all edge cases specified in the problem statement.
