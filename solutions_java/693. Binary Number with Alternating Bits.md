[Leetcode 693. Binary Number with Alternating Bits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l693)
### Problem Statement
Given a positive integer, check whether it has alternating bits: namely, if two adjacent bits will always have different values.

**Example 1:**
- Input: 5
- Output: true
- Explanation: The binary representation of 5 is: 101

**Example 2:**
- Input: 7
- Output: false
- Explanation: The binary representation of 7 is: 111

**Example 3:**
- Input: 11
- Output: false
- Explanation: The binary representation of 11 is: 1011

**Example 4:**
- Input: 10
- Output: true
- Explanation: The binary representation of 10 is: 1010

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input integer be zero?
    - No, the input is a positive integer.
2. Are there any constraints on the size of the integer?
    - The integer should be within the range of typical 32-bit signed integers.

### Strategy
To determine if a number has alternating bits, we can follow these steps:
1. Obtain the binary representation of the integer.
2. Check adjacent bits to see if they are different.

A more efficient way involves avoiding the binary representation string manipulation:
1. Perform bitwise operations to check alternating bits.
2. Create a mask that, when XORed with the number, results in a number consisting entirely of 1s.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean hasAlternatingBits(int n) {
        // First, shift n right by one bit and XOR it with the original number
        int shifted = n >> 1;
        int xor = n ^ shifted;
        
        // Check if xor + 1 is a power of 2, which means xor must be of the form '111...111'
        return (xor & (xor + 1)) == 0;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.hasAlternatingBits(5)); // true
        System.out.println(sol.hasAlternatingBits(7)); // false
        System.out.println(sol.hasAlternatingBits(11)); // false
        System.out.println(sol.hasAlternatingBits(10)); // true
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because the bitwise operations are performed in a constant number of steps, irrespective of the size of the input integer.
