[Leetcode 1418. Display Table of Food Orders in a Restaurant](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1418)
## Problem Statement

You are given the array `orders`, where `orders[i] = [customerNamei, tableNumberi, foodItemi]`. The restaurant has a most frequently ordered food item list for each table. You need to display the table in a specific format:

- The first row should be a header with "Table" followed by names of food items, sorted lexicographically.
- Each subsequent row should contain the table number, followed by the number of each food item ordered at that table, sorted by the food items.

Write a function to return the display table of food orders in the specified format.

### Function Signature
```java
public List<List<String>> displayTable(List<List<String>> orders)
```

### Example

**Input:**
```java
orders = [["David","3","Ceviche"],["Corina","10","Beef Burrito"],["David","3","Fried Chicken"],["Carla","5","Water"],["Carla","5","Ceviche"],["Rous","3","Ceviche"]]
```

**Output:**
```java
[["Table","Beef Burrito","Ceviche","Fried Chicken","Water"],
["3","0","2","1","0"],
["5","0","1","0","1"],
["10","1","0","0","0"]]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can table numbers skip any number, that is, do we need to handle non-sequential table numbers?
   - Yes, table numbers can be non-sequential.
  
2. Is it guaranteed that all food items will have at least one order?
   - No, some foods might not be ordered at all from any table.
  
3. Can we assume that the input will always be valid and orders will be well-formed?
   - Yes, we can assume that the input is valid and well-formed.

## Strategy

1. **Data Structures:**
   - Use a TreeSet to store and sort food items lexicographically.
   - Use a TreeMap for storing table data (table number as the key and another map for counting food items).

2. **Steps:**
   - Parse through the list of orders to populate the TreeSet of food items and the TreeMap for table data.
   - Iterate through the TreeMap to prepare the result list in the required format.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - No orders at all (though input guarantees valid data, this edge case should not occur by definition).

## Code

Here's the implementation in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

public List<List<String>> displayTable(List<List<String>> orders) {
    TreeSet<String> foodItems = new TreeSet<>();
    TreeMap<Integer, Map<String, Integer>> tableData = new TreeMap<>();

    for (List<String> order : orders) {
        String customerName = order.get(0);
        int tableNumber = Integer.parseInt(order.get(1));
        String foodItem = order.get(2);

        foodItems.add(foodItem);
        
        tableData.putIfAbsent(tableNumber, new HashMap<>());
        Map<String, Integer> foodOrderCount = tableData.get(tableNumber);
        foodOrderCount.put(foodItem, foodOrderCount.getOrDefault(foodItem, 0) + 1);
    }

    List<List<String>> result = new ArrayList<>();
    List<String> header = new ArrayList<>();
    header.add("Table");
    header.addAll(foodItems);
    result.add(header);

    for (Map.Entry<Integer, Map<String, Integer>> tableEntry : tableData.entrySet()) {
        List<String> row = new ArrayList<>();
        int tableNumber = tableEntry.getKey();
        Map<String, Integer> ordersMap = tableEntry.getValue();

        row.add(String.valueOf(tableNumber));
        for (String item : foodItems) {
            row.add(String.valueOf(ordersMap.getOrDefault(item, 0)));
        }
        result.add(row);
    }

    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Insertion into TreeSet and TreeMap:**
   - Insertion of `n` orders with sorting costs `O(n log n)`.

2. **Iteration for constructing the result list:**
   - Constructing headers and iterating through the tables and food items.
   - Costs approximately `O(f + t + tf)` where `f` is the number of food items, `t` is the number of tables.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n log n + tf)` which is manageable for reasonably large inputs.
