[Leetcode 815. Bus Routes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l815)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `routes` representing bus routes where `routes[i]` is a bus route that the `i`-th bus repeats forever. For example, if `routes[0] = [1, 2, 7]`, this means that the `0`-th bus travels in the sequence `1 -> 2 -> 7 -> 1 -> 2 -> 7 -> ...`. We start at bus stop `source` (initially not on any bus) and want to go to bus stop `target` by taking the minimum number of buses.

Return the least number of buses you must take to travel from the `source` to the `target`. If it is not possible to reach the `target`, return `-1`.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: routes = [[1, 2, 7], [3, 6, 7]], source = 1, target = 6
Output: 2
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we return if the `source` is the same as the `target`?**
   - Return 0, because no buses are needed.

2. **What are the constraints on the number of bus routes and stops?**
   - The number of routes and the number of stops can go up to around 500.

3. **Can there be duplicate bus stops within the same route?**
   - No, each route is described as a sequence of unique stops.

4. **Could the stops be represented as any integers (including negative)?**
   - For simplicity, assume the bus stops are positive integers.

### Strategy

The problem can be visualized as a graph traversal problem:
- Each bus stop is a node.
- Each bus route represents a connection between nodes because taking a bus on a certain route allows traveling between those stops.

To find the minimum number of buses to take,
1. **Build the graph**: Create an adjacency list where each stop maps to buses connecting to other stops.
2. **BFS Traversal**: Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse through the bus stops starting from the `source`, tracking the number of buses we've boarded:
   - Use a queue to facilitate BFS traversal.
   - Use a set to track visited bus stops to prevent cycles.

### Code

Here's a Java implementation of the approach:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class BusRoutes {
    public int numBusesToDestination(int[][] routes, int source, int target) {
        if (source == target) return 0;
        
        // Map each bus stop to list of buses (routes) that stop there
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> stopToBusesMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < routes.length; i++) {
            for (int stop : routes[i]) {
                stopToBusesMap.putIfAbsent(stop, new ArrayList<>());
                stopToBusesMap.get(stop).add(i);
            }
        }
        
        // Queue for BFS: each element is a pair (current stop, number of buses taken so far)
        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(new int[]{source, 0});
        
        // Set to track visited stops
        Set<Integer> visitedStops = new HashSet<>();
        visitedStops.add(source);
        
        // Set to track visited buses/routes to avoid boarding the same bus multiple times
        Set<Integer> visitedBuses = new HashSet<>();
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] current = queue.poll();
            int currentStop = current[0];
            int busesTaken = current[1];
            
            // From the current stop, try all buses/routes that pass through here
            for (int bus : stopToBusesMap.getOrDefault(currentStop, new ArrayList<>())) {
                if (visitedBuses.contains(bus)) continue;
                
                // Mark this bus as visited
                visitedBuses.add(bus);
                
                // Try all stops on this bus route
                for (int nextStop : routes[bus]) {
                    if (nextStop == target) {
                        return busesTaken + 1;
                    }
                    if (!visitedStops.contains(nextStop)) {
                        visitedStops.add(nextStop);
                        queue.offer(new int[]{nextStop, busesTaken + 1});
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        // If BFS completes without finding the target
        return -1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BusRoutes solver = new BusRoutes();
        int[][] routes = // use example above
        int source = 1;
        int target = 6;
        System.out.println(solver.numBusesToDestination(routes, source, target)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Building the Graph**: O(N * M), where N is the number of routes and M is the maximum length of a route.
- **BFS Traversal**: O(N * M), because in the worst case, we might visit every stop for every bus.
- Overall: **O(N * M)**.

This ensures that the solution is both efficient and scalable within the problem's constraints.
