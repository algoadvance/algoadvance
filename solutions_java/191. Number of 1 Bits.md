[Leetcode 191. Number of 1 Bits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l191)
### Problem Statement

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the Hamming weight).

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000000001011
Output: 3
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000000001011 has a total of three '1' bits.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 00000000000000000000000010000000
Output: 1
Explanation: The input binary string 00000000000000000000000010000000 has a total of one '1' bit.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: n = 11111111111111111111111111111101
Output: 31
Explanation: The input binary string 11111111111111111111111111111101 has a total of thirty one '1' bits.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format:** Is the input guaranteed to be a 32-bit unsigned integer?
    - Yes, the input is a 32-bit unsigned integer.

2. **Output Format:** Should the function return the count as an integer?
    - Yes, the function should return an integer representing the number of '1' bits.

3. **Edge Cases:** Are there any specific edge cases to be aware of?
    - The edge case would be the number `0` which has zero '1' bits.

### Code

Here's the Java code to solve the problem:

```java
public class Solution {
    // Function to count the number of 1 bits
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        while (n != 0) {
            count += (n & 1); // increment count if the least significant bit is 1
            n = n >>> 1; // unsigned right shift operator
        }
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int n1 = 0b00000000000000000000000000001011; // Binary literal for ease of testing
        int n2 = 0b00000000000000000000000010000000;
        int n3 = 0b11111111111111111111111111111101;

        System.out.println(sol.hammingWeight(n1)); // Output: 3
        System.out.println(sol.hammingWeight(n2)); // Output: 1
        System.out.println(sol.hammingWeight(n3)); // Output: 31
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialize a Counter:** Initialize a counter variable to keep track of the number of '1' bits.
2. **Bitwise Operations:** Use bitwise operations to check each bit of the input integer.
   - `(n & 1)` isolates the least significant bit. If it's `1`, we increment the counter.
   - Use unsigned right shift (`>>>`) to discard the least significant bit each time.
3. **Loop Until Zero:** Continue shifting and counting until the input number becomes zero.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the provided solution is **O(1)**. 

- **Explanation:** The loop runs a fixed number of times (32 times for a 32-bit integer). This does not depend on the value of the input integer. Therefore, the function runs in constant time.
