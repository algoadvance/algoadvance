[Leetcode 870. Advantage Shuffle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l870)
### Problem Statement
You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` both of the same length. The advantage of `nums1` with respect to `nums2` is the number of positions `i` for which `nums1[i] > nums2[i]`.

Return any permutation of `nums1` that maximizes its advantage with respect to `nums2`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the length range of `nums1` and `nums2`?**
   - The arrays can have length from `1` to `10^5`.
   
2. **What is the range of values for elements in `nums1` and `nums2`?**
   - The elements range from `0` to `10^9`.

3. **Do the arrays contain duplicate elements?**
   - Yes, the arrays can contain duplicate elements.

4. **What if multiple permutations give the same advantage?**
   - Any permutation that maximizes the advantage is acceptable.

### Strategy
To maximize the advantage of `nums1` over `nums2`:
1. **Sort both arrays**: Given the sorted version, you can use a two-pointer technique to maximize the counts of `nums1[i] > nums2[i]`.
2. **Greedy Allocation**: Use a two-pointer approach to assign the smallest possible `nums1` that can beat `nums2`'s current largest remaining element. If no such `nums1` is found, assign it to the smallest remaining `nums2` (these can be paired with any `nums1`).

### Approach
1. Sort `nums2` and keep track of their original indices.
2. Sort `nums1`.
3. Use a deque (double-ended queue) to allocate elements from `nums1`:
   - Match the smallest element in `nums1` that is still greater than the current element in `nums2`.
   - If no such element exists, use the smallest element in `nums1` with the smallest element in `nums2` (i.e., `nums1` cannot win here).

### Code
Here's the Java code implementing the strategy:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public class AdvantageShuffle {
    public int[] advantageCount(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        // Length of the arrays
        int n = nums1.length;

        // Sort nums1 to facilitate sorting logic
        Arrays.sort(nums1);
        
        // Generate pairs of (value, index) for nums2, then sort by value
        int[][] nums2WithIndex = new int[n][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            nums2WithIndex[i][0] = nums2[i];
            nums2WithIndex[i][1] = i;
        }
        Arrays.sort(nums2WithIndex, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
        
        // Result array to hold the permutation of nums1
        int[] result = new int[n];
        
        // Two pointers to allocate numbers
        int left = 0, right = n - 1;

        // Use a for loop to process sorted nums1
        for (int num : nums1) {
            if (num > nums2WithIndex[left][0]) {
                // If the current number can take advantage, place it in the result
                result[nums2WithIndex[left][1]] = num;
                left++;
            } else {
                // Otherwise, place it against the largest remaining number in nums2
                result[nums2WithIndex[right][1]] = num;
                right--;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AdvantageShuffle solution = new AdvantageShuffle();
        int[] nums1 = {2,7,11,15};
        int[] nums2 = {1,10,4,11};
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(solution.advantageCount(nums1, nums2))); // Expected output [2,11,7,15] or any permutation with maximum advantage.
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- Sorting `nums1` and `nums2WithIndex`: \(O(n \log n)\)
- Assigning elements using two pointers: \(O(n)\)
- Overall time complexity: \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient for the input size constraints.

This approach ensures that we use a greedy method to maximize the advantage by making optimal pairing strategies.
