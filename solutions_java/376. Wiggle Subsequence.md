[Leetcode 376. Wiggle Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l376)
## Problem Statement:
 
A **wiggle sequence** is a sequence where the differences between successive numbers strictly alternate between positive and negative. A sequence with fewer than two elements is trivially a wiggle sequence.

For example, `[1, 7, 4, 9, 2, 5]` is a wiggle sequence because the differences `(7-1=6)`, `(4-7=-3)`, `(9-4=5)`, `(2-9=-7)`, and `(5-2=3)` are alternately positive and negative. Another example is `[1, 4, 7, 2, 5]` which is not a wiggle sequence because `[4-1=3]` and `[7-4=3]` are not alternating.

Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest wiggle sequence.

### Example
1. **Input:** `nums = [1,7,4,9,2,5]`
   **Output:** `6` 
2. **Input:** `nums = [1,17,5,10,13,15,10,5,16,8]`
   **Output:** `7`
3. **Input:** `nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9]`
   **Output:** `2`

### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

---

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the elements of the array (e.g., non-negative)?
   **A:** Yes, the elements range from 0 to 1000.

2. **Q:** Should the sequence be strictly alternating or can it have consecutive equal elements?
   **A:** The sequence should have strictly alternating differences between consecutive elements.

3. **Q:** How should single-element arrays be treated?
   **A:** A single-element array is trivially a wiggle sequence, so the length should be 1.

## Strategy:

To tackle this problem efficiently, we will use a greedy approach. The idea is to iterate over the array and maintain two variables: `up` and `down`. 

- `up` keeps track of the length of the longest wiggle sequence ending with an upward wiggle.
- `down` keeps track of the length of the longest wiggle sequence ending with a downward wiggle.

While iterating through the array:

1. If the current element is greater than the previous one, it means we have an upward wiggle, so we update `up`.
2. If the current element is less than the previous one, it means we have a downward wiggle, so we update `down`.
3. If the current element equals the previous one, we move on as it doesn't contribute to a wiggle sequence.

By the end of the traversal, the maximum of `up` and `down` will give us the length of the longest wiggle sequence.

## Code:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int wiggleMaxLength(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length < 2) {
            return nums.length;
        }

        // Initialize up and down
        int up = 1;
        int down = 1;

        // Traverse the array from the second element
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
                up = down + 1;
            } else if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) {
                down = up + 1;
            }
        }

        // The result is the maximum between up and down
        return Math.max(up, down);
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:
The time complexity of the above code is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the input array `nums`. This is because we are iterating through the array once.
