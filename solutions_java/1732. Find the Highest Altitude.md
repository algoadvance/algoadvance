[Leetcode 1732. Find the Highest Altitude](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1732)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `gain` where `gain[i]` is the net gain in altitude between the (i-1)-th and the i-th points on a trip, return the highest altitude of a point.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the length of the array `gain`?
    - Are the integers in `gain` positive, negative, or both?
    - Is it guaranteed that the initial altitude is zero?

2. **Output Requirements**:
    - Should the result be the highest altitude reached at any point?

### Code
Here is a Java solution to the problem.

```java
public class HighestAltitude {
    public int largestAltitude(int[] gain) {
        int currentAltitude = 0;
        int highestAltitude = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < gain.length; i++) {
            currentAltitude += gain[i];
            if (currentAltitude > highestAltitude) {
                highestAltitude = currentAltitude;
            }
        }

        return highestAltitude;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HighestAltitude solver = new HighestAltitude();
        
        int[] gain1 = {-5, 1, 5, 0, -7};
        System.out.println(solver.largestAltitude(gain1));  // Output: 1

        int[] gain2 = {-4, -3, -2, -1, 4, 3, 2};
        System.out.println(solver.largestAltitude(gain2));  // Output: 0
    }
}
```

### Strategy
1. **Initialization**:
    - Start with `currentAltitude` set to 0, which is the starting altitude.
    - `highestAltitude` is also initially set to 0.

2. **Iterate through the `gain` array**:
    - For each element in the array, update the `currentAltitude` by adding the current gain to it.
    - If `currentAltitude` exceeds `highestAltitude`, update `highestAltitude` to the current value of `currentAltitude`.

3. **Return the highest altitude reached during the trip**.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the gain array. We are only iterating through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1). We are using only a constant amount of extra space for variables `currentAltitude` and `highestAltitude`.

This approach ensures an efficient solution to the problem while keeping the implementation straightforward.
