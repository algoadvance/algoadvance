[Leetcode 2444. Count Subarrays With Fixed Bounds](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2444)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and two integers `minK` and `maxK`, you need to count the number of subarrays where the minimum value is equal to `minK` and the maximum value is equal to `maxK`.

### Clarifying Questions
To better understand the problem, let's consider some clarifying questions:

1. **What is the range of values for the `nums` array and integers `minK` and `maxK`?**
   - `nums` can contain both positive and negative integers.
   - Typically, for competitive programming, it's safe to assume integer values fit within the standard 32-bit integer range unless specified.

2. **Can the array contain duplicates?**
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicates.

3. **Is there any constraint on the length of the subarray?**
   - No specific constraint other than it should be a contiguous part of the original array and satisfy the conditions of having minimum equal to `minK` and maximum equal to `maxK`.

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, a sliding window approach can be used to keep track of subarrays that meet the constraints. Here's the plan:

1. **Initialize Tracking Indices**: Use variables to track the latest positions of `minK` and `maxK` and the start of the valid window of the subarray.
   
2. **Iterate through the Array**: Traverse the `nums` array while updating the positions. For each element:
   - Update the positions for `minK` and `maxK`.
   - Calculate the smallest valid subarray starting from the earliest position of `minK` and `maxK`.

3. **Count Valid Subarrays**: Count subarrays from the start of the window to the current position that satisfies the conditions.

### Code

Here's the implementation:

```java
public class CountSubarraysWithFixedBounds {
    public long countSubarrays(int[] nums, int minK, int maxK) {
        long count = 0;
        int start = 0;
        int lastMinPos = -1, lastMaxPos = -1;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] < minK || nums[i] > maxK) {
                start = i + 1;
                lastMinPos = lastMaxPos = -1;
            }

            if (nums[i] == minK) lastMinPos = i;
            if (nums[i] == maxK) lastMaxPos = i;

            if (lastMinPos != -1 && lastMaxPos != -1) {
                count += Math.min(lastMinPos, lastMaxPos) - start + 1;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CountSubarraysWithFixedBounds solution = new CountSubarraysWithFixedBounds();
        int[] nums = {1,3,5,2,7,5};
        int minK = 1, maxK = 5;
        System.out.println(solution.countSubarrays(nums, minK, maxK));  // Expected output: 2

        nums = new int[]{1,1,1,1};
        minK = 1;
        maxK = 1;
        System.out.println(solution.countSubarrays(nums, minK, maxK));  // Expected output: 10
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialize Variables**: `count` to store the number of valid subarrays, `start` to mark the beginning of the current candidate subarray, and `lastMinPos`, `lastMaxPos` to track the latest positions of `minK` and `maxK`.
2. **Reset Start on Invalid Element**: When an element outside the `[minK, maxK]` range is encountered, reset the `start` and positions of `minK` and `maxK`.
3. **Update Positions**: Whenever `minK` or `maxK` is encountered, update their respective positions.
4. **Count Valid Subarrays**: When both `minK` and `maxK` have been seen in the current window, count all valid subarrays ending at the current position which start not earlier than the first occurrence of `minK` or `maxK`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time complexity**: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. The solution iterates through the array once.
- **Space complexity**: `O(1)` because we are using a fixed amount of extra space.

This approach ensures we efficiently count subarrays with the given constraints without redundant calculations.
