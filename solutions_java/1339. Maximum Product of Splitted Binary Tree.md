[Leetcode 1339. Maximum Product of Splitted Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1339)
## Problem Statement

- **Given**: A binary tree `root`.
- **Task**: Split the binary tree into two subtrees by removing one edge such that the product of the sums of the subtrees is maximized. Return the maximum product of the sums modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

**Constraints**:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 5 * 10^4]`.
- Each node's value is in the range `[1, 10000]`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Is the tree guaranteed to be non-empty?
   - **A**: Yes, the problem states the number of nodes is at least 2.

2. **Q**: Can the values in the tree be negative or non-integers?
   - **A**: No, values are integers within `[1, 10000]`.

3. **Q**: Can there be any duplicate values in the tree?
   - **A**: Yes, the values can be duplicated.

4. **Q**: Is there a specific format for the output?
   - **A**: The result should be the maximum product of the sums of two subtrees, taken modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

## Strategy

1. **Calculate Total Sum**:
   - Perform a tree traversal to calculate the total sum of all node values.

2. **DFS for Possible Sums**:
   - Traverse the tree again to calculate the sum of each possible subtree by removing an edge.
   - For each subtree sum, compute the product of the subtree sum and the remaining nodes' sum.
   - Keep track of the maximum product encountered.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since the result can be large, use modulo \(10^9 + 7\) during computations to avoid overflow.

## Code

Here's the implementation in Java:

```java
class Solution {
    long totalSum = 0;
    long maxProductResult = 0;
    final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;
    
    public int maxProduct(TreeNode root) {
        // Step 1: Calculate total sum of the tree
        totalSum = calculateSum(root);
        
        // Step 2: Calculate maximum product by traversing again
        calculateMaxProduct(root);
        
        return (int)(maxProductResult % MOD);
    }
    
    private long calculateSum(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) return 0;
        return node.val + calculateSum(node.left) + calculateSum(node.right);
    }
    
    private long calculateMaxProduct(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) return 0;
        
        long subTreeSum = node.val + calculateMaxProduct(node.left) + calculateMaxProduct(node.right);
        long otherTreeSum = totalSum - subTreeSum;
        
        // Calculate product of the current split
        long currentProduct = subTreeSum * otherTreeSum;
        
        // Update max product if the current one is larger
        maxProductResult = Math.max(maxProductResult, currentProduct);
        
        return subTreeSum;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Calculation of Total Sum**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes, using a single DFS traversal.
- **Calculation of Maximum Product**: \(O(n)\), using another DFS traversal.
 
Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\).

This solution efficiently computes the desired maximum product by leveraging depth-first searches to gather necessary data and compute results.
