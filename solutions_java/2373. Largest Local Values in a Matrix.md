[Leetcode 2373. Largest Local Values in a Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2373)
### Problem Statement
You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `grid`. Generate an `n-2 x n-2` matrix `result` such that:
- `result[i][j]` is equal to the largest value in the 3x3 matrix centered at `(i+1, j+1)` in the input matrix `grid`.

Example:
```
Input: grid = [[9,9,8,1],
               [5,6,2,6],
               [8,2,6,4],
               [6,2,2,2]]
Output: [[9,9],
         [8,6]]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the size of the grid?**
   - Typically, we would expect constraints like `3 <= n <= 100`. This ensures the grid is large enough to form at least one 3x3 matrix.
   
2. **What are the possible ranges for the elements in the grid?**
   - Usually, the elements can range from `-10^5` to `10^5`.

3. **Should we consider any specific data type to handle large numbers?**
   - No, in Java, the default `int` can handle the range specified.

### Strategy
1. **Iterate through the sub-matrices:**
   - We'll iterate through the `grid` such that at each point `[i][j]`, we consider the 3x3 matrix centered around `[i+1][j+1]`.
2. **Find the max value for each sub-matrix:**
   - For each 3x3 matrix, compute the maximum value.
3. **Store the computed max value into the result matrix:**
   - The resulting matrix is `n-2 x n-2` in size.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int[][] largestLocal(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        int[][] result = new int[n - 2][n - 2];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 2; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n - 2; j++) {
                result[i][j] = getMaxFrom3x3(grid, i, j);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    private int getMaxFrom3x3(int[][] grid, int row, int col) {
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int i = row; i < row + 3; i++) {
            for (int j = col; j < col + 3; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] > max) {
                    max = grid[i][j];
                }
            }
        }
        return max;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[][] grid = {
            {9, 9, 8, 1},
            {5, 6, 2, 6},
            {8, 2, 6, 4},
            {6, 2, 2, 2}
        };
        int[][] result = solution.largestLocal(grid);
        
        for (int[] row : result) {
            for (int value : row) {
                System.out.print(value + " ");
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Iteration through grid:** The outer loops iterate `O((n-2)^2)` times.
- **Finding the max in each 3x3 matrix:** This operation takes constant time `O(1)` as it considers exactly 9 elements.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O((n-2)^2)**.

This approach is efficient given the problem constraints and should perform well within typical input size limits.
