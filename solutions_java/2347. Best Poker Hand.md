[Leetcode 2347. Best Poker Hand](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2347)
## Problem Statement

Alice has a hand of 5 cards, which might only contain integers from 1 to 13 (inclusive). The cards can be represented as an integer array where each value represents the cardâ€™s face value.

Alice needs to determine the best possible poker hand that can be made with these 5 cards.

The possible poker hands are:

1. "Four of a Kind": Four cards with the same face value.
2. "Full House": Three cards of one face value and two cards of another face value.
3. "Three of a Kind": Three cards with the same face value.
4. "Two Pair": Two different pairs of cards.
5. "Pair": Two cards with the same face value.
6. "High Card": Any hand that does not meet the above conditions.

Write a function to determine the best poker hand Alice can have.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: cards = [4,4,4,4,5]
Output: "Four of a Kind"

Input: cards = [10,10,10,4,4]
Output: "Full House"
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the cards have any integer value other than 1 to 13?
   - No, the cards will only have values from 1 to 13.
2. Will the cards always contain exactly 5 cards?
   - Yes, the input will always be an array of 5 integers.
3. Should the function consider the suit of the cards?
   - No, only the face values matter for this problem.

## Strategy

1. First, count the occurrences of each face value using a hash map.
2. Based on the counts:
   - Check if any count == 4 for "Four of a Kind".
   - Check if the counts contain both a 3 and a 2 for "Full House".
   - Check if any count == 3 for "Three of a Kind".
   - Check if there are exactly two pairs for "Two Pair".
   - Check if any count == 2 for "Pair".
3. If none of the above conditions meet, return "High Card".

## Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class BestPokerHand {
    public String bestHand(int[] cards) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> countMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (int card : cards) {
            countMap.put(card, countMap.getOrDefault(card, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        boolean hasThree = false, hasPair = false;
        int pairs = 0;
        
        for (int count : countMap.values()) {
            if (count == 4) {
                return "Four of a Kind";
            } else if (count == 3) {
                hasThree = true;
            } else if (count == 2) {
                hasPair = true;
                pairs++;
            }
        }
        
        if (hasThree && hasPair) {
            return "Full House";
        } else if (hasThree) {
            return "Three of a Kind";
        } else if (pairs == 2) {
            return "Two Pair";
        } else if (pairs == 1) {
            return "Pair";
        }
        
        return "High Card";
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BestPokerHand pokerHand = new BestPokerHand();
        System.out.println(pokerHand.bestHand(new int[]{4, 4, 4, 4, 5})); // Four of a Kind
        System.out.println(pokerHand.bestHand(new int[]{10, 10, 10, 4, 4})); // Full House
        System.out.println(pokerHand.bestHand(new int[]{2, 4, 4, 5, 6})); // Pair
        System.out.println(pokerHand.bestHand(new int[]{1, 2, 3, 4, 5})); // High Card
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of cards. Given that n is always 5 in this problem, our algorithm runs in constant time, O(1).

- Counting occurrences in the hash map takes O(n) time.
- Evaluating the counts to determine the poker hand also takes O(n) time.
Thus, the overall complexity is O(n), which is effectively O(1) given n = 5.
