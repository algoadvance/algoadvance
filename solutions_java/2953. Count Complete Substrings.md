[Leetcode 2953. Count Complete Substrings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2953)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return the number of complete substrings in it. A complete substring is defined as a substring that contains every letter in the English alphabet at least once.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all characters in the input string guaranteed to be lower-case English letters?**
   - No, the input can contain any character, but we are only interested in counting lower-case English alphabet letters.

2. **Should the output be focused only on lowercase English letters (a-z)?**
   - Yes, only substrings containing all 26 lowercase English letters at least once should be counted.

3. **What is the expected length of the input string `s`?**
   - The length can be quite long, up to `10^5` characters.

4. **If the input is guaranteed not to be invalid (i.e., length less than 26 could be a constraint)?**
   - The string can be any length including less than 26 but such strings trivially have 0 complete substrings since they can't contain all the letters.

### Strategy

1. **Sliding Window Technique**: 
   - Use a sliding window to find substrings of `s` that contain all 26 letters.
   - Move the right pointer to extend the window until we have a complete set of the alphabet.
   - Move the left pointer to shrink the window from the left and count valid windows.
  
2. **HashSet for Uniqueness**:
   - Maintain a count of unique characters using a HashSet.
   - Use a frequency array or map to track the count of each character within the current window.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashSet;

public class CountCompleteSubstrings {
    public static int countCompleteSubstrings(String s) {
        if (s.length() < 26) {
            return 0;
        }

        int left = 0, right = 0;
        int count = 0;
        int[] freq = new int[26];
        HashSet<Character> uniqueChars = new HashSet<>();

        while (right < s.length()) {
            char rChar = s.charAt(right);
            if (Character.isLowerCase(rChar)) {
                freq[rChar - 'a']++;
                uniqueChars.add(rChar);
            }

            while (uniqueChars.size() == 26) {
                char lChar = s.charAt(left);
                if (Character.isLowerCase(lChar)) {
                    freq[lChar - 'a']--;
                    if (freq[lChar - 'a'] == 0) {
                        uniqueChars.remove(lChar);
                    }
                }
                count += s.length() - right;
                left++;
            }

            right++;
        }

        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String test = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabc";

        System.out.println(countCompleteSubstrings(test)); // Example run
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the length of the string `s`.
  - Each character in the string is processed at most twice (once by the right pointer and once by the left pointer).
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since the size of the `freq` array and `HashSet` is constant and does not depend on the input size (`26` characters for the English alphabet).

This approach ensures that we accurately find and count all substrings containing all lowercase English letters efficiently.
