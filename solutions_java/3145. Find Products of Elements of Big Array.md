[Leetcode 3145. Find Products of Elements of Big Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3145)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return an integer array `result` such that `result[i]` is equal to the product of all the elements of `nums` except `nums[i]`.

You are required to solve it **without using division** and in `O(n)` time complexity.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**:
   - How large can the input array be?
   
2. **Constraints**:
   - Are there any constraints on the values within the array (positive, negative, zero)?
   
3. **Output**:
   - The result array should be of the same length as the input array?

## Strategy

### Plan:
1. **Initial Check**:
   - Validate the input to ensure it is not an empty array.
   
2. **Multiplicative Prefix and Suffix**:
   - Use two auxiliary arrays, `left_products` and `right_products`.
   - `left_products[i]` will hold the product of all elements to the left of index `i`.
   - `right_products[i]` will hold the product of all elements to the right of index `i`.
   
3. **Result Calculation**:
   - The product for each index `i` in result array can be computed as `left_products[i] * right_products[i]`.
   
### Steps:
1. **Create left_products array**:
   - Traverse the input array from left to right, and populate `left_products`.
   
2. **Create right_products array**:
   - Traverse the input array from right to left, and populate `right_products`.
   
3. **Combine Arrays**:
   - Multiply corresponding elements from the `left_products` and `right_products` arrays to form the result array.

## Code

```java
public class ProductOfArrayExceptSelf {
    public int[] productExceptSelf(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] result = new int[n];
        
        // Initialize the left and right product arrays
        int[] left_products = new int[n];
        int[] right_products = new int[n];
        
        // Calculate left_products
        left_products[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            left_products[i] = left_products[i - 1] * nums[i - 1];
        }
        
        // Calculate right_products
        right_products[n - 1] = 1;
        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            right_products[i] = right_products[i + 1] * nums[i + 1];
        }
        
        // Calculate the result by multiplying left_products and right_products
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            result[i] = left_products[i] * right_products[i];
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The above approach has a time complexity of `O(n)` because each phase (left_products, right_products, and final result calculation) individually traverses the array once.

1. **Left Products**: `O(n)`
2. **Right Products**: `O(n)`
3. **Result Multiplication**: `O(n)`

Hence, the total time complexity is `O(3n)`, which simplifies to `O(n)`.
