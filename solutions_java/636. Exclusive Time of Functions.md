[Leetcode 636. Exclusive Time of Functions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l636)
## Problem Statement

The problem is taken from LeetCode's Problem 636 - Exclusive Time of Functions. Here is the complete problem description:

You have a single-threaded CPU and are given a list of `functions` that are executed by the CPU. Each function has a unique ID between 0 and `n-1`.

You are also given a list `logs`, where `logs[i]` represents a string with three pieces of information: the function id, whether it is a `start` or `end` event for that function, and the timestamp when the event happens.

Each line in the logs list follows this format: "function_id:start_or_end:timestamp". For example, "0:start:10" means function 0 started at time 10, and "1:end:15" means function 1 ended at time 15.

The CPU can execute only one function at a time, and it will always finish executing the current function before starting a new one. Functions can be recursive, meaning a function might call another function (or itself) during its execution.

You need to return a list of integers representing the exclusive time of each function. The exclusive time of a function is the total time spent executing that function, excluding the time spent executing other functions called within it.

## Clarifying Questions

Before jumping to the solution, let's clarify a few things about the problem:
1. How is time represented in the logs? Is it guaranteed to be in a sorted order?
2. What are the constraints on the number of functions `n` and the length of the `logs` list?
3. Can there be more than one function starting at the same timestamp, or is it strictly sequential?

Assumptions:
- The logs are provided in sorted order by timestamps.
- Function IDs and timestamps are non-negative integers.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a stack to keep track of the functions being executed. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize a stack to keep track of function IDs.
2. Initialize an array `result` to keep track of the exclusive time for each function ID.
3. Keep a variable `prev_time` to track the time of the last processed log.
4. Iterate through each log entry. Depending on whether it's a start or end event:
   - If it's a start event, calculate the time spent on the previous function (if any), update the result for the function at the stack's top, then push the current function onto the stack.
   - If it's an end event, calculate the time spent on the current function, pop it from the stack, then update `prev_time`.

Boundary conditions and updates will be carefully managed to avoid off-by-one errors in time calculations.

## Code

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Stack;

public class Solution {
    public int[] exclusiveTime(int n, List<String> logs) {
        // Result array to store exclusive times
        int[] result = new int[n];
        
        // Stack to keep track of function calls
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        // Variable to keep track of previous timestamp
        int prevTime = 0;
        
        for(String log : logs) {
            String[] parts = log.split(":");
            int funcId = Integer.parseInt(parts[0]);
            String action = parts[1];
            int currTime = Integer.parseInt(parts[2]);
            
            if(action.equals("start")) {
                if(!stack.isEmpty()) {
                    // Update the top function's exclusive time using the diff between
                    // current time and previous time
                    result[stack.peek()] += currTime - prevTime;
                }
                // Push the current function onto the stack
                stack.push(funcId);
                // Update previous time to current time
                prevTime = currTime;
            } else { // action.equals("end")
                // Update the current function's exclusive time
                result[stack.peek()] += currTime - prevTime + 1;
                // Pop the function from stack as its execution has ended
                stack.pop();
                // Update previous time to current time + 1 because "end" log includes current timestamp
                prevTime = currTime + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(m), where m is the number of log entries. We process each log entry once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n + k), where `n` is the number of unique functions (for the result array) and `k` is the maximum depth of the call stack (for the stack). In the worst case, this could be O(n) if there are nested calls but generally is much less.
