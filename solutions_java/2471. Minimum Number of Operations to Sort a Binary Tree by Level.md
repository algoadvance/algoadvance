[Leetcode 2471. Minimum Number of Operations to Sort a Binary Tree by Level full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2471)
### Problem Statement
You are given the `root` of a binary tree with `n` nodes. Each node in the tree has a distinct value. In one operation, you can swap any two nodes in the tree. Return the minimum number of operations needed to sort the binary tree by level.

Two nodes are considered to be on the same level if they have the same distance from the root (the number of edges on the path from the node to the root).

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the values of the nodes distinct?**
   - Yes, every node has a distinct value.
2. **Can we assume the binary tree is properly constructed?**
   - Yes, you can assume the binary tree is valid and properly constructed.
3. **What do we mean by sorting the binary tree by level?**
   - For each level, the nodes should be sorted in ascending order based on their values.

### Strategy
1. **Level Order Traversal:** First, perform a level order traversal of the tree to gather nodes at each level.
2. **Sorting and Counting Swaps:** For each level, determine the number of swaps needed to sort the nodes in ascending order.

#### Steps:
1. Perform a level order traversal to collect nodes at each level.
2. For each level, extract the values and determine the number of swaps needed to sort these values using the concept of finding the minimum number of swaps to sort an array.

### Code
Hereâ€™s the implementation in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MinimumOperationsToSortBinaryTree {
    // TreeNode class definition
    public static class TreeNode {
        int val;
        TreeNode left;
        TreeNode right;
        TreeNode() {}
        TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
        TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
            this.val = val;
            this.left = left;
            this.right = right;
        }
    }

    public int minimumOperations(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;

        // BFS Queue for level order traversal
        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(root);

        int minOperations = 0;

        // Perform level order traversal
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int levelSize = queue.size();
            int[] levelValues = new int[levelSize];
            TreeNode[] levelNodes = new TreeNode[levelSize];

            for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
                TreeNode node = queue.poll();
                levelValues[i] = node.val;
                levelNodes[i] = node;

                if (node.left != null) queue.offer(node.left);
                if (node.right != null) queue.offer(node.right);
            }

            // Find the number of swaps needed to sort levelValues
            minOperations += findMinSwapsToSort(levelValues);
        }

        return minOperations;
    }

    private int findMinSwapsToSort(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] sortedNums = Arrays.copyOf(nums, n);
        Arrays.sort(sortedNums);

        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        Map<Integer, Integer> indexMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            indexMap.put(sortedNums[i], i);
        }

        int swaps = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (visited[i] || indexMap.get(nums[i]) == i) continue;

            int cycleSize = 0;
            int j = i;

            while (!visited[j]) {
                visited[j] = true;
                j = indexMap.get(nums[j]);
                cycleSize++;
            }

            if (cycleSize > 1) {
                swaps += (cycleSize - 1);
            }
        }

        return swaps;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(1, new TreeNode(3, new TreeNode(5), new TreeNode(4)), new TreeNode(2, new TreeNode(6), new TreeNode(7)));
        MinimumOperationsToSortBinaryTree solution = new MinimumOperationsToSortBinaryTree();
        System.out.println(solution.minimumOperations(root)); // Output: expected number of operations
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Level Order Traversal:** O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.
- **Sorting and Counting Swaps per Level:**
  - Sorting (per level): O(m log m), where `m` is the number of nodes at that level.
  - Counting swaps using cycle detection: O(m).

Overall, the time complexity is approximately O(n log n) considering we may sort nodes at each level multiple times.

### Summary
By performing a level order traversal to gather nodes per level and determining the minimum number of swaps needed to sort nodes at each level, we can efficiently calculate the minimum number of operations required to sort the binary tree by level.
