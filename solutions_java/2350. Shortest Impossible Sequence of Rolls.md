[Leetcode 2350. Shortest Impossible Sequence of Rolls](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2350)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `rolls` of length `n` and an integer `k`. You roll a k-sided dice `n` times and record the results of the rolls in the array `rolls`. Return the length of the shortest sequence of rolls of a k-sided dice that cannot appear as a subsequence in the rolls array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the value range for `n` and `k`?**
    - Constraints specify that `1 <= rolls.length <= 10^5` and `1 <= k <= 10^5`.

2. **Are the values in the `rolls` array guaranteed to be between 1 and `k`?**
    - Yes, since the rolls are results of a k-sided dice.

3. **What should be done if multiple sequences of the same shortest length cannot appear?**
    - We only need to return the length of such sequence, not the sequence itself.

### Strategy

We need to determine the length of the shortest sequence that cannot be found as a subsequence in the `rolls` array. The key observation is that the longest possible subsequence of length `k` constructed from a k-sided dice rolled `n` times is essentially bounded by the pigeonhole principle.

1. If you try to cover all possible sequences of a certain length and succeed, it implies you can keep finding longer ones.
2. When it's impossible to further cover all combinations of length, that's the answer we seek.

We'll keep sets of all sides rolled and track subsequent lengths from `1` to when it's not possible.

**Steps:**

1. Initialize an integer `length` to `1`.
2. Iterate through `rolls` while maintaining a set of all observed sides in the sequence.
3. Once a set achieves size `k`, it implies we can cover all `k` sided sequences of current length, increment the `length` and reset the set.
4. Repeat until we can't cover all at a certain sequence length.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class Solution {
    public int shortestSequence(int[] rolls, int k) {
        int length = 1;
        Set<Integer> seen = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (int roll : rolls) {
            seen.add(roll);
            if (seen.size() == k) {
                length++;
                seen.clear();
            }
        }
        
        return length;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** 
    - The algorithm iterates over the `rolls` array once, contributing `O(n)` complexity.
    - Set operations (add and size) are average `O(1)`.

In total, the approach operates in `O(n)` time complexity.

- **Space Complexity:**
    - The space complexity is `O(k)` due to the set storing up to `k` unique roll values.
