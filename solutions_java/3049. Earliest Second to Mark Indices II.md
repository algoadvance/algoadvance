[Leetcode 3049. Earliest Second to Mark Indices II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3049)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of n identifiers, ids, where ids[i] is the identifier of the ith frame. Every second, you can mark the indices of some frames as processed. You need to determine the earliest second such that there exists some indices which will be marked at the second having the same identifier at those indices.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Identifiers Range**: Are the identifiers guaranteed to be non-negative integers?
2. **Duplicate Identifiers**: Can the same identifier appear multiple times in non-consecutive indices?
3. **Multiple Answers**: If multiple answers exist, which one should be returned (smallest time)?
4. **Edge Cases**: Should we consider edge cases like empty identifier list or all unique identifiers?

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.HashSet;

public class EarliestSecondToMarkIndices {
    
    public int earliestSecond(int[] ids) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> identifierToLastIndex = new HashMap<>();
        HashSet<Integer> markedIdentifiers = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < ids.length; i++) {
            int id = ids[i];
            
            if (identifierToLastIndex.containsKey(id)) {
                if (!markedIdentifiers.contains(id)) {
                    return i;
                }
            } else {
                identifierToLastIndex.put(id, i);
            }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        EarliestSecondToMarkIndices solution = new EarliestSecondToMarkIndices();
        
        int[] ids1 = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1};
        int[] ids2 = {4, 5, 6, 7, 8};
        int[] ids3 = {2, 2, 2, 2, 2};
        
        System.out.println(solution.earliestSecond(ids1)); // Expected output: 3
        System.out.println(solution.earliestSecond(ids2)); // Expected output: -1
        System.out.println(solution.earliestSecond(ids3)); // Expected output: 1
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Data Structures**: Use a hash map (`identifierToLastIndex`) to store the last index of each identifier and a hash set (`markedIdentifiers`) to keep track of already processed identifiers.
   
2. **Single Pass Check**: Iterate through the list of identifiers. For each identifier:
   - If it is already in the hash map, check if it has been marked:
     - If it has been marked before, return the current index as the earliest second with duplicate.
   - If the identifier is not found in the hash map, update the map with the current index.
   
3. **Return Result**: If no duplicate identifiers are found during the pass, return `-1`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of identifiers. We are making a single pass through the list and performing constant time operations with the hash map and hash set.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), as we store the identifiers and their indices.

This approach efficiently finds the earliest second with a duplicate identifier using linear time and space, ensuring we handle all edge cases naturally.
