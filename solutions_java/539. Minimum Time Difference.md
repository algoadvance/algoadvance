[Leetcode 539. Minimum Time Difference](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l539)
### Problem Statement
Given a list of 24-hour clock time points in "HH:MM" format, return the minimum minutes difference between any two time points in the list.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the maximum size of the input list?
    - Should the list always contain valid time points in "HH:MM" format?

2. **Output Requirements**:
    - What should be returned if the input list is empty or contains only one time point?

After assuming or asking for these clarifications, let's proceed with the solution.

### Strategy
1. **Convert Time Points to Minutes**:
    - Convert each time point from "HH:MM" to the total minutes elapsed since "00:00" (midnight).

2. **Sort the Minutes**:
    - Sort the array of minutes.

3. **Compute Minimum Difference**:
    - Compute the differences between each consecutive time point in the sorted list.
    - Also consider the wrap-around difference between the last time point of the day and the first time point of the day.

4. **Return Minimum Difference**:
    - Return the smallest of these differences.

### Code
Here is the Java solution for the problem:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    public int findMinDifference(List<String> timePoints) {
        int n = timePoints.size();
        int[] minutes = new int[n];
        
        // Convert each timePoint to minutes since 00:00
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            String time = timePoints.get(i);
            String[] parts = time.split(":");
            int hours = Integer.parseInt(parts[0]);
            int mins = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]);
            minutes[i] = hours * 60 + mins;
        }
        
        // Sort the array of minutes
        Arrays.sort(minutes);
        
        // Compute the minimum difference
        int minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 1; i < minutes.length; i++) {
            int diff = minutes[i] - minutes[i - 1];
            minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, diff);
        }
        
        // Wrap-around difference (last and first time point)
        int wrapAroundDiff = (1440 + minutes[0] - minutes[n - 1]) % 1440;  // ensuring non-negative difference
        minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, wrapAroundDiff);
        
        return minDiff;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        List<String> timePoints = Arrays.asList("23:59", "00:00");

        int result = solution.findMinDifference(timePoints);
        System.out.println(result);  // Should print 1
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Converting Time Points to Minutes**: O(n)
    - Where `n` is the number of time points.
- **Sorting the Minutes Array**: O(n log n)
- **Finding Minimum Difference**: O(n)

Hence, the overall time complexity is O(n log n), where `n` is the number of time points.

This solution is optimal and works efficiently within the permissible bounds of typical input sizes for such interview problems.
