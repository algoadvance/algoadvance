[Leetcode 1997. First Day Where You Have Been in All the Rooms](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1997)
## Problem Statement:
You have a hotel with `n` rooms. On each day `i` (starting from day `0`), you visit the rooms in such a way that:
- On day `i`, you visit all the rooms you haven't visited before in ascending order.

You want to figure out the first day when you have visited all the rooms in the hotel. The rooms are indexed from `0 to n-1`.

Return the first day when you have been in all the rooms.

### Example 1:
- Input: `n = 3`
- Output: `2`
- Explanation:
  - On day 0: Visit room 0
  - On day 1: Visit rooms 0, 1
  - On day 2: Visit rooms 0, 1, 2 (all rooms), so return 2.

### Example 2:
- Input: `n = 4`
- Output: `3`
- Explanation:
  - On day 0: Visit room 0
  - On day 1: Visit rooms 0, 1
  - On day 2: Visit rooms 0, 1, 2
  - On day 3: Visit rooms 0, 1, 2, 3 (all rooms), so return 3.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Q:** Can I assume `n` will always be a positive integer?
   - **A:** Yes.
2. **Q:** Should I consider the case when `n` is `1`?
   - **A:** Yes, if `n` is `1`, the output should be `0` since you've visited the only room on the first day.

## Strategy:
- We need to find out on which day all rooms have been visited.
- We observe that rooms `0 to i` are visited completely on day `i`.
- Thus, the first day when we have visited `n` rooms will be `n-1`.

## Time Complexity:
- The solution will execute in constant time, i.e., `O(1)`.

## Code:
```java
public class Solution {
    public int firstDayBeenInAllRooms(int n) {
        return n - 1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        
        // Test cases
        System.out.println(solution.firstDayBeenInAllRooms(3)); // Output: 2
        System.out.println(solution.firstDayBeenInAllRooms(4)); // Output: 3
        System.out.println(solution.firstDayBeenInAllRooms(1)); // Output: 0
    }
}
```

This function calculates the first day when you visit all the rooms by simply returning `n-1`. This approach leverages the observation of room visiting patterns and has a time complexity of `O(1)`.
