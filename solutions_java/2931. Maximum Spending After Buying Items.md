[Leetcode 2931. Maximum Spending After Buying Items](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2931)
### Problem Statement

Given a list of prices for different items and a budget, determine the maximum amount you can spend on any non-empty subset of items such that the total cost does not exceed the budget.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints**:
   - What is the maximum size of the list of prices (`n`)?
   - What are the ranges of the prices and the budget?

2. **Output**:
   - Should the output be a single integer representing the maximum spendable amount within the budget?

3. **Duplicates**:
   - Are there any restrictions or considerations regarding duplicate prices in the input list?

Let's assume the following based on potential answers:
- The size of the list, `n`, can range from 1 to 50.
- The prices of the items and the budget are positive integers and can be fairly large, e.g., up to 10^4.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a combination of backtracking and dynamic programming:

1. **Subset Sum Problem**:
   - This problem is closely related to the subset sum problem where we need to find the maximum subset sum that does not exceed a given number (`budget`).

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[j]` will represent whether a sum `j` can be obtained from some subset of the list of prices.
   - Initialize `dp[0]` as `true` since a sum of zero can always be obtained by choosing an empty subset.

3. **Iterate Through Prices**:
   - For each price, iterate through the `dp` array in reverse to update possible sums that can be formed.
   - Reverse iteration is crucial to avoid using the same item more than once in the current stage.

### Code

Here is the Java code implementation based on the described strategy:

```java
public class MaximumSpending {

    public static int maximumSpend(int[] prices, int budget) {
        boolean[] dp = new boolean[budget + 1];
        dp[0] = true;

        for (int price : prices) {
            for (int j = budget; j >= price; j--) {
                if (dp[j - price]) {
                    dp[j] = true;
                }
            }
        }

        // Find the maximum sum we can get that is still <= budget
        for (int i = budget; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (dp[i]) {
                return i;
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] prices = {1, 3, 4, 5};
        int budget = 7;
        System.out.println(maximumSpend(prices, budget));  // Output should be 7
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: O(1)
- **Nested Loop**:
  - The outer loop iterates over the length of the prices array, `n`.
  - The inner loop iterates over the budget, `B`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n * B)` where `n` is the number of items and `B` is the budget.

- **Space Complexity**: O(B) due to the `dp` array.

Feel free to run the program with different inputs to verify its correctness and understand its behavior with various cases.
