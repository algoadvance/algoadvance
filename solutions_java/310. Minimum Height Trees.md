[Leetcode 310. Minimum Height Trees](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l310)
### Problem Statement
Given a tree with `n` nodes, labeled from `0` to `n-1`, and an array of `n-1` edges where `edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates an undirected edge between nodes `a_i` and `b_i`, you need to find the roots of the Minimum Height Trees (MHTs). A treeâ€™s height is determined as the number of edges in the longest path from the root to any leaf. Your task is to return a list of possible root nodes for the MHTs.

**Example:**

Input: `n = 4`, `edges = [[1, 0], [1, 2], [1, 3]]`

Output: `[1]`

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4`
- `edges.length == n - 1`
- `0 <= a_i, b_i < n`
- All pairs `(a_i, b_i)` are distinct.
- The given input is guaranteed to be a tree (i.e., it is connected and has no cycles).

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the format of the output?**
   - The output should be a list of node indices which are the roots of the Minimum Height Trees.
   
2. **Can the tree be empty?**
   - No, the constraint states that `1 <= n`, so there's at least one node.

3. **Should we handle invalid inputs?**
   - The problem guarantees that the input is a valid tree, so no need to handle invalid cases.

### Strategy
1. This problem essentially requires finding the "centroid" of the tree. The concept is to remove leaf nodes layer by layer and focus on the center. In practice:
   1. Initialize each node's degree (number of connections).
   2. Identify leaf nodes (nodes with only one connection).
   3. Iteratively remove leaf nodes and update the degrees of their neighbors until 2 or fewer nodes remain.
   4. The remaining nodes are the roots of the MHTs.

2. We'll use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) to prune the tree layer by layer.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MinimumHeightTrees {
    public List<Integer> findMinHeightTrees(int n, int[][] edges) {
        if (n == 1) return Collections.singletonList(0);
        
        // Build the graph using adjacency list
        List<Set<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph.add(new HashSet<>());
        }
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            graph.get(edge[0]).add(edge[1]);
            graph.get(edge[1]).add(edge[0]);
        }
        
        // Initialize the first layer of leaves
        List<Integer> leaves = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (graph.get(i).size() == 1) {
                leaves.add(i);
            }
        }
        
        // Trim the leaves until we reach the core of the graph
        int remainingNodes = n;
        while (remainingNodes > 2) {
            remainingNodes -= leaves.size();
            List<Integer> newLeaves = new ArrayList<>();
            for (int leaf : leaves) {
                int neighbor = graph.get(leaf).iterator().next();
                graph.get(neighbor).remove(leaf);
                if (graph.get(neighbor).size() == 1) {
                    newLeaves.add(neighbor);
                }
            }
            leaves = newLeaves;
        }
        
        return leaves;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumHeightTrees mht = new MinimumHeightTrees();
        int n = 4;
        int[][] edges = // use example above
        System.out.println(mht.findMinHeightTrees(n, edges));  // Output: [1]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Building the graph:** `O(n)`, since there are `n-1` edges.
- **Removing leaves iteratively:** Each node is processed once, so this is also `O(n)`.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n)`, which is efficient for the input constraints (`1 <= n <= 2 * 10^4`).
