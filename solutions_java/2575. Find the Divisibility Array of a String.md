[Leetcode 2575. Find the Divisibility Array of a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2575)
## Problem Statement
The problem is defined as finding the divisibility array for a given string representation of a large number and a specific integer `m`. The goal is to create an array where each element indicates if the number formed from the start of the string to that index is divisible by `m`.

Given a numeric string `num` and an integer `m`, generate an array `result` such that `result[i]` is `1` if the integer represented by `num[0...i]` is divisible by `m`, and `0` otherwise.

### Example:
1. Input: `num = "12121"`, `m = 3`
   Output: `[0, 0, 0, 1, 0]`
   - Explanation: 
     - 1 is not divisible by 3 -> `0`
     - 12 is divisible by 3 -> `1`
     - 121 is not divisible by 3 -> `0`
     - 1212 is divisible by 3 -> `1`
     - 12121 is not divisible by 3 -> `0`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can `num` have leading zeros?
2. What is the range for the length of `num` and the value of `m`?
3. Should we assume that the input string `num` strictly contains digits and no other characters?

Given these clarifications, we can progress to the solution.

## Strategy
1. Traverse the string `num` and compute the number formed from the start to the current index.
2. Check if this number is divisible by `m`.
3. Append `1` to the result array if it is divisible, otherwise `0`.

### Algorithm:
- Initialize a variable `current_value` to zero.
- Iterate through each character in `num`:
  - Update `current_value` to be `current_value * 10 + (current character as digit)`.
  - Check if `current_value` mod `m` is zero.
  - Append the result (either `1` or `0`) to the result array.
- Return the result array.

## Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class DivisibilityArray {
    public static List<Integer> findDivisibilityArray(String num, int m) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        long currentValue = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < num.length(); i++) {
            currentValue = currentValue * 10 + (num.charAt(i) - '0');
            if (currentValue % m == 0) {
                result.add(1);
            } else {
                result.add(0);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test case
        String num = "12121";
        int m = 3;
        System.out.println(findDivisibilityArray(num, m)); // Output: [0, 1, 0, 1, 0]
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- The solution involves a single traversal of the string `num`, and the updates to `current_value`, along with modulo checks, occur in constant time.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `num`.

This should efficiently determine the divisibility array for any given numeric string `num` and integer `m`.
