[Leetcode 1032. Stream of Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1032)
## Problem Statement

You are tasked with implementing the `StreamChecker` class to check if any given word in a list of words ends with specific characters queried so far. Here's an outline of the task:

1. **Initialize**: You will be given a list of words at the initialization.
2. **Query**: You will receive individual character queries one by one. For each query, you need to determine if any word in the initial list of words ends with the sequence of characters seen so far.

The `StreamChecker` class should implement the following methods:
- **`StreamChecker(String[] words)`**: Initializes the object with the given list of words.
- **`boolean query(char letter)`**: Returns `true` if any word in the list ends with the sequence of characters queried so far; otherwise returns `false`.

## Strategy

To solve this problem effectively, we can use a Trie (prefix tree) with reversed words. Hereâ€™s the strategy:

1. **Reverse Words and Build Trie**: Reverse each word from the provided list and insert it into a Trie. This will allow us to efficiently check suffixes of the query string as prefixes in the Trie.
2. **Query Handling**:
   - Maintain a dynamic list of recent characters (up to the length of the longest word in the list).
   - For each query character, append it to the recent character list.
   - Check if this reversed list of characters forms any prefix in the Trie.

## Code

Here's the Java implementation:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class StreamChecker {

    // Trie Node definition
    private class TrieNode {
        TrieNode[] children = new TrieNode[26];
        boolean isEndOfWord = false;
    }

    private TrieNode root;
    private List<Character> queryStream;
    private int maxWordLength;

    public StreamChecker(String[] words) {
        root = new TrieNode();
        queryStream = new ArrayList<>();
        maxWordLength = 0;

        // Build Trie with reversed words
        for (String word : words) {
            insert(new StringBuilder(word).reverse().toString());
            maxWordLength = Math.max(maxWordLength, word.length());
        }
    }

    private void insert(String word) {
        TrieNode node = root;
        for (char ch : word.toCharArray()) {
            int index = ch - 'a';
            if (node.children[index] == null) {
                node.children[index] = new TrieNode();
            }
            node = node.children[index];
        }
        node.isEndOfWord = true;
    }

    public boolean query(char letter) {
        queryStream.add(0, letter);  // Add letter to the front

        if (queryStream.size() > maxWordLength) {
            queryStream.remove(queryStream.size() - 1);  // Maintain size within maxWordLength
        }

        TrieNode node = root;
        for (char ch : queryStream) {
            int index = ch - 'a';
            if (node.children[index] == null) {
                return false;
            }
            node = node.children[index];
            if (node.isEndOfWord) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: Building the Trie takes `O(N * L)` where `N` is the number of words and `L` is the average length of words.
- **Query**: Each query operation works in `O(M)` where `M` is the length of the longest word, since we might need to traverse the Trie up to that length.

This approach ensures that the query operation remains efficient even with a growing number of queries.
