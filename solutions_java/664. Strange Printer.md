[Leetcode 664. Strange Printer](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l664)
### Problem Statement

There is a strange printer with the following two special properties:
1. The printer can only print a sequence of the same character each time.
2. At each turn, the printer can print a new sequence of characters on top of the previous ones, and will only overwrite the characters that are already on the paper.

Given a string `s`, return the minimum number of turns the printer needed to print it.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: 
   - The length of the string `s` will be in the range [1, 100].
   - `s` will consist of lowercase English letters.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - What happens if `s` is already uniform, like "aaaa"? In this case, it seems clear that only one print turn is needed.
   - How do we handle repeated characters that are dispersed, such as "aba"? The solution will require strategic overwrites.

### Strategy

The task is to find the minimum number of turns required to print the string `s` using the strange printer.

#### Dynamic Programming Approach:

1. **Definition**: Use a 2D array `dp[i][j]` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of turns needed to print the substring `s[i..j]`.
   
2. **Initialization**:
   - If `i == j`, `dp[i][j] = 1` because a single character needs only one turn to print.

3. **Transition/Recurrence**:
   - For substring `s[i..j]`, consider all possible k (`i <= k < j`) to divide the string into two parts `s[i..k]` and `s[k+1..j]`.
   - If characters `s[k] == s[j]`, it means printing `s[j]` will overwrite `s[k]`, thus possibly reducing the number of turns.
   - The recurrence relation can be given by:
     ```
     dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][k] + dp[k + 1][j]) for all k in range [i, j)
     if s[k] == s[j]:
         dp[i][j] = min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k + 1][j] - 1)
     ```

4. **Final Result**:
   - The answer will be in `dp[0][n-1]` where `n` is the length of `s`.

### Code

```java
public class StrangePrinter {

    public int strangePrinter(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[n][n];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i][i] = 1; // Single character case
        }

        for (int length = 2; length <= n; length++) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - length; i++) {
                int j = i + length - 1;
                dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1] + 1; // Initialize with worst case
                for (int k = i; k < j; k++) {
                    if (s.charAt(k) == s.charAt(j)) {
                        dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k + 1][j - 1]);
                    } else {
                        dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k + 1][j]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[0][n - 1];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StrangePrinter sp = new StrangePrinter();
        String s = "aaabbb";
        System.out.println(sp.strangePrinter(s));  // Output should be 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n^3)\) because we are using three nested loops: 
  - One for the length of the substring
  - One for starting index of the substring
  - One for partitioning the substring.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is \(O(n^2)\) due to the 2D DP table used to store the results of the subproblems.
