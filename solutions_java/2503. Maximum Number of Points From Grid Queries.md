[Leetcode 2503. Maximum Number of Points From Grid Queries](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2503)
## Problem Statement
You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid` and an array of integers `queries`, where the `i-th` query returns the number of points in the grid within the value `queries[i]`.

A point `(r, c)` is within a query value `k` if `grid[r][c] < k`.

Return an integer array `result` where `result[i]` is the number of points in the grid for the `i-th` query.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Do we need to return the points themselves, or just the count of the points within the value specified in the query?
   - **Answer**: Just the count of the points within the value specified in the query.
   
2. Can we assume the grid and queries contain only positive integers?
   - **Answer**: Yes, you can assume the grid and queries contain only positive integers.
   
3. Are there any constraints on the size of the grid and number of queries?
   - **Answer**: Typical constraint sizes should be clarified (e.g., 1 <= m, n <= $10^3$ and 1 <= number of queries <= $10^6$), to balance performance and feasibility.

## Strategy
1. **Preprocessing the Grid**:
   - Since we want to efficiently answer each query which asks for the count of points with values less than a given threshold, a preprocessing step where we gather information about the gridâ€™s values can be beneficial.

2. **Using a Min-Heap**:
   - Utilize a min-heap to process the elements of the grid in increasing order of their values to ensure efficient counting.
   - As we extract elements from the min-heap, we'll maintain a count of elements seen so far.

3. **Query Handling**:
   - As we process each query, if the query value is greater than the current element value from the min-heap, elements continue to be extracted and counted.
   - Efficiently retrieve counts using preprocessed information.

4. **Sorting Queries**:
   - Sorting the queries to handle them in increasing order allows cumulative counting from previously processed queries.
   - After sorting, maintain a result index back-mapping to position results correctly.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int[] maxPointsGridQueries(int[][] grid, int[] queries) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        
        // Create query information with original indices
        int[][] queryInfo = new int[queries.length][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < queries.length; i++) {
            queryInfo[i][0] = queries[i]; // query value
            queryInfo[i][1] = i;          // query index
        }
        Arrays.sort(queryInfo, Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[0])); // sort queries by their values
        
        // Min-Heap (PriorityQueue) to track grid cells in ascending order
        PriorityQueue<int[]> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[0]));
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[m][n];
        
        // Initial grid processing
        minHeap.add(new int[]{grid[0][0], 0, 0});
        visited[0][0] = true;
        
        int[] result = new int[queries.length];
        int count = 0;
        int directions[][] = // use example above
        
        for (int[] query : queryInfo) {
            int queryValue = query[0];
            int queryIndex = query[1];
            
            while (!minHeap.isEmpty() && minHeap.peek()[0] < queryValue) {
                int[] cell = minHeap.poll();
                count++;
                int value = cell[0];
                int r = cell[1];
                int c = cell[2];
                
                for (int[] dir : directions) {
                    int nr = r + dir[0];
                    int nc = c + dir[1];
                    if (nr >= 0 && nr < m && nc >= 0 && nc < n && !visited[nr][nc]) {
                        minHeap.add(new int[]{grid[nr][nc], nr, nc});
                        visited[nr][nc] = true;
                    }
                }
            }
            result[queryIndex] = count;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Heap Processing**:
   - Inserting all elements into the heap has a time complexity of O(m * n * log(m * n)) due to the log factor during heap insertion/extraction operations.

2. **Query Processing**:
   - Sorting queries: O(k log k), where k is the number of queries.
   - Extracting from the heap for each query, processing: amortized O(m * n + k), as each element is inserted and removed once.

Thus, the total time complexity is approximately O(m * n * log(m * n) + k log k), where m * n is the grid size, and k is the number of queries.
