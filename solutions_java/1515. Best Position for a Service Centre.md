[Leetcode 1515. Best Position for a Service Centre](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1515)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `positions` of size `n` where `positions[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the coordinates of the `i-th` service center. A service center can be positioned at any real coordinate. The distance between two coordinates `[a, b]` and `[c, d]` is defined as the Euclidean distance `sqrt((a - c)² + (b - d)²)`.

Return the minimum possible distance between a coordinate `[x, y]` where `0 <= xi, yi <= 100` for all `i` and the optimal location for the new service center.

### Example:
```
Input: positions = [[0,1],[1,0],[1,2],[2,1]]
Output: 1.414213562
Explanation: A service centre positioned at (1, 1) will have the minimum possible distance to all the other service centers.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Clarify the Constraints:**
   - Are there any constraints on the number of positions `n`?
   - What precision is required in the output?

2. **Understanding Real Coordinates:**
   - It is clear that the optimal location can be a real coordinate. Do we need to account for any special floating-point precision issues?

3. **Return Type:**
   - We will return a double representing the minimal possible distance. What precision should be considered adequate?

## Strategy

One effective approach for such optimization problems is the **Weiszfeld's Algorithm**, which is used to find the geometric median, which minimizes the sum of distances to a set of given points. The geometric median is the point that minimizes the total Euclidean distance to a set of points, which is suitable for our problem.

### Strategy Steps

1. **Initialization:**
   - Start with an arbitrary initial guess (e.g., the centroid of the given points).

2. **Iteratively Apply Weiszfeld's Algorithm:**
   - Update the position using weighted average considering the current distances to the points.
   - Continue iterating until the change in position is below a certain threshold (convergence).

3. **Floating Point Precision:**
   - Ensure the iteration stops when the position is not changing significantly to avoid infinite loops due to precision errors.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public double getMinDistSum(int[][] positions) {
        double x = 0;
        double y = 0;
        int n = positions.length;
        
        for (int[] p : positions) {
            x += p[0];
            y += p[1];
        }
        
        x /= n;
        y /= n;
        
        double threshold = 1e-7;
        double diff = Double.MAX_VALUE;
        
        while (diff > threshold) {
            double numX = 0; // numerator for X
            double numY = 0; // numerator for Y
            double denom = 0; // denominator
            
            for (int[] p : positions) {
                double dx = x - p[0];
                double dy = y - p[1];
                double dist = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
                
                if (dist != 0) {
                    numX += p[0] / dist;
                    numY += p[1] / dist;
                    denom += 1 / dist;
                }
            }
            
            double newX = numX / denom;
            double newY = numY / denom;
            
            diff = Math.sqrt((newX - x) * (newX - x) + (newY - y) * (newY - y));
            x = newX;
            y = newY;
        }
        
        double sumDist = 0;
        for (int[] p : positions) {
            double dx = x - p[0];
            double dy = y - p[1];
            double dist = Math.sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy);
            sumDist += dist;
        }
        
        return sumDist;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization:** O(n)
- **Iteration per Step:**
  - Calculation of numerator and denominator: O(n)
  - Update the centroid: O(1)
- If we assume the algorithm converges in `k` iterations, the total time complexity is `O(kn)` where `k` depends on the precision requirement and the initial guess.

By following the steps mentioned in our strategy and code implementation, we can find the position of the service center which minimizes the possible distance to all given coordinates.
