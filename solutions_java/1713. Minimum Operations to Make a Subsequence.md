[Leetcode 1713. Minimum Operations to Make a Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1713)
## Problem Statement
You are given an array `target` that consists of distinct integers and another integer array `arr` that may have duplicates. The goal is to form `target` as a subsequence of `arr` with the minimum number of operations. In one operation, you can insert any integer at any position in `arr`. Return the minimum number of operations needed to make `target` a subsequence of `arr`.

**Example:**
- **Input:** `target = [5,1,3], arr = [9,4,2,3,4]`
- **Output:** `2`

- **Input:** `target = [6,4,8,1,3,2], arr = [4,7,6,2,3,8,6,1,7]`
- **Output:** `3`

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Is there any constraint on the size of `target` and `arr`?
2. Can the values in `target` and `arr` be negative?
3. Is it possible for `arr` to be empty?

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to understand that the minimum number of operations required to form `target` as a subsequence in `arr` is equivalent to finding the length of the longest common subsequence (LCS) of `target` and `arr`. The remaining elements in `target` that are not part of this subsequence would need to be inserted.

Steps:
1. Map the elements of `target` to their indices.
2. Filter `arr` such that we keep only the indices of the elements that are also in `target`.
3. Find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in this filtered list of indices.
4. Subtract the length of LIS from the length of `target` to get the minimum number of insertions required.

## Code
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] target, int[] arr) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> targetIndexMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < target.length; i++) {
            targetIndexMap.put(target[i], i);
        }
        
        List<Integer> filteredIndices = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int num : arr) {
            if (targetIndexMap.containsKey(num)) {
                filteredIndices.add(targetIndexMap.get(num));
            }
        }

        return target.length - lengthOfLIS(filteredIndices);
    }
    
    private int lengthOfLIS(List<Integer> nums) {
        List<Integer> lis = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            int pos = Collections.binarySearch(lis, num);
            if (pos < 0) pos = -(pos + 1);
            if (pos == lis.size()) {
                lis.add(num);
            } else {
                lis.set(pos, num);
            }
        }
        return lis.size();
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] target1 = {5, 1, 3};
        int[] arr1 = {9, 4, 2, 3, 4};
        System.out.println(solution.minOperations(target1, arr1)); // Output: 2

        int[] target2 = {6, 4, 8, 1, 3, 2};
        int[] arr2 = {4, 7, 6, 2, 3, 8, 6, 1, 7};
        System.out.println(solution.minOperations(target2, arr2)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Mapping of `target` indices:** O(n), where `n` is the length of `target`.
2. **Filtering `arr` and transforming to indices:** O(m), where `m` is the length of `arr`.
3. **Finding the length of LIS using binary search:** O(m log m).

Overall, the time complexity is O(n + m log m), which is efficient for reasonably large inputs.
