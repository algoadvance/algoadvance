[Leetcode 2784. Check if Array is Good](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2784)
### Problem Statement

2784. Check if Array is Good

You are given an array `nums` of length `n` consisting of distinct integers from the range `[0, n-1]`.

A "good" array is defined as an array where:

1. Each integer from the range `[0, n-1]` appears exactly once in the array.

Write a function `isGoodArray(int[] nums)` that returns `true` if the array is "good" and `false` otherwise.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [3, 0, 1, 2]
Output: true

Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: false
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - No, according to the problem statement, the integers are from the range `[0, n-1]`.

2. **What is the size of the array?**
   - The length of the array is `n`.

3. **Can there be duplicate numbers in the array?**
   - No, all integers are distinct as per the problem statement.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, the approach is straightforward since the array contains distinct integers, and we just need to check if every integer from `0` to `n-1` is present in the array. Hereâ€™s how we can do this:

1. **Sort the array** and check if it matches the sequence `[0, 1, 2, ... , n-1]`.
2. **Use a HashSet** to add each element in the array and then check if the size of the HashSet is `n` and it contains all integers from `0` to `n-1`.

I will use the second approach which doesn't involve sorting and is efficient.

### Code
```java
import java.util.HashSet;

public class Solution {
    public boolean isGoodArray(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();

        for (int num : nums) {
            set.add(num);
        }

        if (set.size() != n) {
            return false;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!set.contains(i)) {
                return false;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] nums1 = {3, 0, 1, 2};
        int[] nums2 = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        System.out.println(solution.isGoodArray(nums1)); // Output: true
        System.out.println(solution.isGoodArray(nums2)); // Output: false
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` due to iterating through the array and using a HashSet for storage. Both insertion and lookup in a HashSet have an average time complexity of `O(1)`.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` because we use a HashSet that may store `n` elements in the worst case.

This solution efficiently checks if the array contains all numbers from `0` to `n-1` exactly once.
