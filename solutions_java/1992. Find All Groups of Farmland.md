[Leetcode 1992. Find All Groups of Farmland](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1992)
# Problem Statement
You have a 2D array `land` which represents a piece of farmland where they have planted some crops. Each cell in `land` can either be `0` (representing no crops) or `1` (representing crops). A contiguous group of `1`s forms a piece of farmland.

Your task is to find all groups of farmland and return their top-left and bottom-right coordinates. For each group, return a list containing the row and column indices of the top-left coordinate followed by the row and column indices of the bottom-right coordinate.

The given `land` matrix will have at least one `1`.

## Example
### Example 1
Input:
```
land = [
  [1,0,0],
  [0,1,1],
  [0,1,1]
]
```
Output:
```
[[0,0,0,0],[1,1,2,2]]
```

### Example 2
Input:
```
land = [
  [1,1],
  [1,1]
]
```
Output:
```
[[0,0,1,1]]
```

# Clarifying Questions
1. Are the farmlands always square/rectangular in shape, or can they be of arbitrary connected shape? 
2. Can we assume that the input grid will always contain at least one `1` as stated in the problem?
3. Are diagonally adjacent cells considered connected?

- Farmlands will be rectangular/square shapes.
- Yes, there will be at least one `1` in the grid.
- No, diagonally adjacent cells are not connected.

# Strategy
1. Initialize an empty list to store the coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corners of each farmland.
2. Iterate through each cell in the `land` matrix. 
3. When encountering a `1`, identify the whole rectangular area as follows:
    - Record the current cell as the top-left corner.
    - Traverse downwards and rightwards until you reach the boundary of the farmland (where you either see `0` or go out of bounds).
    - Record the bottom-right corner.
4. Mark all the cells in this rectangle as visited (e.g., by setting them to `0`).
5. Continue the iteration for the rest of the grid.
6. Return the list of coordinates.

# Code
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class FarmlandFinder {
    public static int[][] findFarmland(int[][] land) {
        List<int[]> farmlands = new ArrayList<>();
        
        int rows = land.length;
        int cols = land[0].length;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                if (land[i][j] == 1) {
                    // Found top-left corner of farmland
                    int[] topLeft = new int[]{i, j};
                    
                    // We now need to find bottom-right corner
                    int row = i;
                    int col = j;
                    
                    // Find the bottom boundary
                    while (row < rows && land[row][j] == 1) {
                        row++;
                    }

                    // Find the right boundary
                    while (col < cols && land[i][col] == 1) {
                        col++;
                    }
                    
                    // Bottom-right coordinates
                    int[] bottomRight = new int[]{row - 1, col - 1};
                    
                    // Add this farmland to the list
                    farmlands.add(new int[]{topLeft[0], topLeft[1], bottomRight[0], bottomRight[1]});
                    
                    // Mark the farmland as visited by setting all cells to 0
                    for (int r = topLeft[0]; r <= bottomRight[0]; r++) {
                        for (int c = topLeft[1]; c <= bottomRight[1]; c++) {
                            land[r][c] = 0;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Convert list to array
        return farmlands.toArray(new int[farmlands.size()][]);
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example test case
        int[][] land = {
            {1, 0, 0},
            {0, 1, 1},
            {0, 1, 1}
        };
        
        int[][] result = findFarmland(land);
        
        for (int[] farm : result) {
            System.out.println("[" + farm[0] + "," + farm[1] + "," + farm[2] + "," + farm[3] + "]");
        }
    }
}
```

# Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the `land` matrix. 

- We iterate through each cell exactly once.
- For each cell containing `1`, we identify the entire farmland and mark it, so each cell will be processed only once.
