[Leetcode 1711. Count Good Meals](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1711)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array, `deliciousness`, where `deliciousness[i]` is the deliciousness of the ith meal. You can make a pair of meals if the sum of their deliciousness values is a power of two, i.e., 2^0, 2^1, 2^2, ..., 2^20.

Return the number of different good meal pairs you can form.

Since the answer can be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= deliciousness.length <= 105`
- `0 <= deliciousness[i] <= 220`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Are the meals distinct or can there be repeating values?
   **A**: The meals can have repeating values.

2. **Q**: Are we given that the sum of two meals must be exactly a power of two?
   **A**: Yes, the sum must strictly be a power of two.

3. **Q**: Is the order of pairs significant?
   **A**: No, (a,b) is the same as (b,a) in this context.

### Strategy

1. **Utilize HashMap**:
   - Use a HashMap to store the frequency of each meal's deliciousness value encountered so far.

2. **Iterate through the Array**:
   - For each meal in the array, iterate through possible sums which are powers of two.
   - Check if the complementary value (required to make a sum a power of two) has been encountered previously.
   - If yes, count the number of such valid pairs.

3. **Return Result Modulo 10^9 + 7**:
   - Since the result can be large, take the result modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

class Solution {
    public int countPairs(int[] deliciousness) {
        final int MOD = 1000000007;
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        long count = 0;

        for (int delicious : deliciousness) {
            int powerOfTwo = 1;
            for (int i = 0; i <= 21; i++) {  // 2^0 to 2^20
                int complement = powerOfTwo - delicious;
                if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
                    count = (count + map.get(complement)) % MOD;
                }
                powerOfTwo <<= 1;  // Multiply by 2
            }
            map.put(delicious, map.getOrDefault(delicious, 0) + 1);
        }

        return (int) count;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Building the Map**: O(N) where N is the length of the `deliciousness` array.
- **Finding Pairs**: For each meal, we check up to 21 possible sums (2^0 to 2^20), so this part is O(21*N), which simplifies to O(N).

Overall, the time complexity is **O(N)**.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is **O(N)** due to the HashMap used to store the frequency of each deliciousness value.

This solution is efficient and should work well within the given constraints.
