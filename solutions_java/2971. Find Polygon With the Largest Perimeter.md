[Leetcode 2971. Find Polygon With the Largest Perimeter](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2971)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers, where each integer represents the length of a side of a polygon. Your task is to find the polygon with the largest perimeter that can be formed with these sides. A polygon must have at least three sides. If it is not possible to form any polygon with the given sides, return 0.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are there any constraints on the number of side lengths in the input array?
   - Assume that the input array can have up to \(10^4\) side lengths, and each side length is a positive integer.
   
2. Can the input array contain duplicates?
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicate values.

3. Should the function handle any specific input cases, such as an empty array or fewer than three side lengths?
   - If the array contains fewer than three side lengths, the function should return 0 since a polygon cannot be formed.

## Strategy

1. **Input validation:** Check if the length of the input array is less than 3. If so, return 0.
2. **Sorting:** Sort the array in descending order to facilitate finding the largest possible perimeter.
3. **Polygon formation:** Use a loop to check consecutive triplets in the sorted list to see if they can form a valid polygon (i.e., the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third side).
4. **Perimeter calculation:** As soon as we find a valid polygon, calculate its perimeter and return it.
5. If no valid polygon is found, return 0.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int largestPerimeter(int[] A) {
        // Check if the input array has fewer than 3 elements
        if (A.length < 3) return 0;

        // Sort the array in descending order
        Arrays.sort(A);
        
        // We need the largest triplets that can form a valid polygon
        // Iterate through the array backwards to find the largest possible perimeter
        for (int i = A.length - 1; i >= 2; i--) {
            if (A[i] < A[i - 1] + A[i - 2]) {
                // a valid triangle is found, return the perimeter
                return A[i] + A[i - 1] + A[i - 2];
            }
        }

        // No valid triangle found
        return 0;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** Sorting the array of lengths takes \(O(n \log n)\) time, where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array.
- **Loop:** The loop that checks for the triplets runs in \(O(n)\) time.

**Overall Time Complexity:** The overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, resulting in \(O(n \log n)\).

This code performs in `O(n log n)` time complexity and `O(1)` space complexity (ignoring the space required for sorting, which is typically considered in-place for Java's `Arrays.sort`). This should efficiently handle the given problem constraints.
