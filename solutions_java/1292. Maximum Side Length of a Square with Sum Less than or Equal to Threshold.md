[Leetcode 1292. Maximum Side Length of a Square with Sum Less than or Equal to Threshold](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1292)
### Problem Statement:
Given a `m x n` matrix `mat` and an integer `threshold`, return the maximum side length of a square with a sum less than or equal to the `threshold` or return 0 if there is no such square.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Q:** Can we assume the matrix contains only non-negative integers?
   - **A:** Yes, you can assume the matrix contains only non-negative integers.
2. **Q:** What should be returned if no square with a sum less than or equal to the threshold exists?
   - **A:** Return 0 in such a case.

### Strategy:
1. **Prefix Sum Array:** Create a prefix sum array to quickly calculate the sum of any sub-matrix. The prefix sum at `(i, j)` will store the sum of all elements in the sub-matrix from `(0, 0)` to `(i, j)`.
2. **Binary Search for Maximum Side Length:**
   - Use binary search to determine the maximum possible side length.
   - For each candidate side length, check all possible squares of that side length to see if their sums are within the threshold using the prefix sum array.

3. **Checking Square Sums:**
   - For an upper-left corner at `(i, j)` of a square with side length `k`, calculate the sum using the prefix sum array:
     - `sum = prefix(i+k-1, j+k-1) - prefix(i-1, j+k-1) - prefix(i+k-1, j-1) + prefix(i-1, j-1)`

### Code Implementation:
```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxSideLength(int[][] mat, int threshold) {
        int m = mat.length;
        int n = mat[0].length;

        // Prefix Sum Array
        int[][] prefix = new int[m + 1][n + 1];

        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                prefix[i][j] = mat[i-1][j-1] + prefix[i-1][j] + prefix[i][j-1] - prefix[i-1][j-1];
            }
        }

        // Binary Search for the maximum side length
        int left = 0, right = Math.min(m, n);
        int result = 0;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (canFindSquare(prefix, mid, threshold)) {
                result = mid;
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }

    private boolean canFindSquare(int[][] prefix, int sideLength, int threshold) {
        int m = prefix.length;
        int n = prefix[0].length;
        
        for (int i = sideLength; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = sideLength; j < n; j++) {
                int sum = prefix[i][j] - prefix[i-sideLength][j] - prefix[i][j-sideLength] + prefix[i-sideLength][j-sideLength];
                if (sum <= threshold) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
1. **Building Prefix Sum:** O(m * n) where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.
2. **Binary Search:** Logarithmic in the possible side lengths (O(log(min(m, n)))).
3. **Checking Square Sums:** Each check takes O(m * n) in the worst case for each side length.

The total time complexity is O(m * n * log(min(m, n))), which should be efficient for reasonable matrix sizes typically found in competitive programming scenarios.
