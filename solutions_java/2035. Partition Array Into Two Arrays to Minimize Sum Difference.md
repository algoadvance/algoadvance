[Leetcode 2035. Partition Array Into Two Arrays to Minimize Sum Difference](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2035)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` of `2 * n` integers, you need to partition this array into two arrays of `n` integers each. You need to minimize the absolute difference of the sums of the elements in each array.

Return the minimum possible absolute difference.

**Example:**

```
Input: nums = [3,9,7,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: Partition [9, 3] and [7, 3]. The absolute difference between 
              sums is abs((9+3) - (7+3)) = 2.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Can `nums` contain negative numbers? (Given the context, usually yes.)
   - Is there a maximum length for `nums`?
   
2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Are there any specific requirements for the returned result? (Usually, it is just the minimum possible absolute difference.)

3. **Special Cases:**
   - What is the expected output if `nums` is already balanced?

Let's assume:
- `nums` will always contain `2 * n` integers where `n >= 1`.
- `nums` may contain negative numbers and the size of `nums` should be within the constraints of typical input sizes in competitive programming.

### Strategy

The core strategy to solve this problem involves:
1. **Dividing the Problem:**
   - Divide the array into two parts. Let's call them part1 and part2.
  
2. **Subset Sum Calculation:**
   - Calculate all possible sums for subsets of part1 and part2.
   - Use these sums to find the closest matching sums between two halves.

3. **Optimal Search for Minimal Difference:**
   - Use binary search or a two-pointer approach to efficiently find the minimum difference from the calculated possible sums.

This approach will help us minimize the absolute difference by considering all possible partitions and their sums.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MinSumDifference {
    public int minimumDifference(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length / 2;
        int[] leftArr = Arrays.copyOfRange(nums, 0, n);
        int[] rightArr = Arrays.copyOfRange(nums, n, nums.length);

        List<List<Integer>> leftSums = generateSubsetSums(leftArr);
        List<List<Integer>> rightSums = generateSubsetSums(rightArr);

        int totalSum = Arrays.stream(nums).sum();
        int halfSum = totalSum / 2;

        int minDifference = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            List<Integer> leftSubset = leftSums.get(i);
            List<Integer> rightSubset = rightSums.get(n - i);
            Collections.sort(rightSubset);

            for (int leftSum : leftSubset) {
                int target = halfSum - leftSum;
                int idx = Collections.binarySearch(rightSubset, target);
                if (idx < 0) idx = -idx - 1;

                if (idx < rightSubset.size()) {
                    int rightSum = rightSubset.get(idx);
                    int sum2 = leftSum + rightSum;
                    int sum1 = totalSum - sum2;
                    minDifference = Math.min(minDifference, Math.abs(sum1 - sum2));
                }

                if (idx > 0) {
                    int rightSum = rightSubset.get(idx - 1);
                    int sum2 = leftSum + rightSum;
                    int sum1 = totalSum - sum2;
                    minDifference = Math.min(minDifference, Math.abs(sum1 - sum2));
                }
            }
        }

        return minDifference;
    }

    private List<List<Integer>> generateSubsetSums(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        List<List<Integer>> subsetSums = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            subsetSums.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }

        int totalSubsets = 1 << n;
        for (int i = 0; i < totalSubsets; i++) {
            int count = Integer.bitCount(i);
            int sum = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if ((i & (1 << j)) != 0) {
                    sum += nums[j];
                }
            }
            subsetSums.get(count).add(sum);
        }

        return subsetSums;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinSumDifference obj = new MinSumDifference();
        int[] nums = {3, 9, 7, 3};
        System.out.println(obj.minimumDifference(nums));  // Output: 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Generating Subset Sums:**
  - `O(2^n * n)` for each half (where `n` is half of the input size). Since we do this for both halves, it results in `O(2^(n/2) * n) * 2`.

- **Sorting and Binary Search:**
  - Sorting the subset sums is `O((2^n)log(2^n))`.
  - Performing binary search while iterating through each combination is `O(2^n * log(2^n))`.

Given the combinatorial nature of the problem, the overall time complexity is exponential, approximating to `O(2^n * n)` for practical input sizes.
