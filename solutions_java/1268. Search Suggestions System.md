[Leetcode 1268. Search Suggestions System full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1268)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `products` and a string `searchWord`. Design a system that suggests at most three product names from `products` after each character of `searchWord` is typed. Suggested products should have the common prefix with `searchWord`. If there are more than three products with a common prefix, return the three lexicographically minimum products.

Return a list of lists of the suggested products after each character of `searchWord` is typed.

**Example:**

```text
Input:
products = ["mobile", "mouse", "moneypot", "monitor", "mousepad"]
searchWord = "mouse"

Output:
[
["mobile", "moneypot", "monitor"],
["mobile", "moneypot", "monitor"],
["mouse", "mousepad"],
["mouse", "mousepad"],
["mouse", "mousepad"]
]
```

**Constraints:**

1. 1 <= products.length <= 1000
2. 1 <= products[i].length <= 3000
3. 1 <= sum(products[i].length) <= 2 * 10^4
4. All the strings of `products` are unique.
5. `products[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
6. 1 <= searchWord.length <= 1000
7. `searchWord` consists of lowercase English letters.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the products list be empty?** 
   - No, as per the constraints, the length of products is at least 1.

2. **Are the products and searchWord case-sensitive?** 
   - No, they consist of only lowercase English letters.

3. **Is the searchWord always a valid string?**
   - Yes, its length is from 1 to 1000 and consists of lowercase English letters.

### Strategy

1. **Sorting the Products:**
   - First, sort the `products` lexicographically. This will help in efficiently finding the suggestions for each prefix because they will be in sorted order naturally.

2. **Iterate Through Prefixes:**
   - For each character in the `searchWord`, consider the substring from the start to the current character (prefix).

3. **Binary Search:**
   - Use binary search to find the starting index of the products that match the current prefix. This will be efficient for locating the prefix in the sorted list.

4. **Collect Results:**
   - From the starting index found from the binary search, collect up to three products that match the prefix.

### Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

public class SearchSuggestionsSystem {

    public List<List<String>> suggestedProducts(String[] products, String searchWord) {
        List<List<String>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        if (products == null || products.length == 0) return result;

        // Sort the product list first
        Arrays.sort(products);

        // Iterate through each character in the searchWord
        String prefix = "";
        for (char c : searchWord.toCharArray()) {
            prefix += c;
            List<String> suggestions = new ArrayList<>();
            
            // Use binary search to find the starting point
            int index = binarySearch(products, prefix);
            for (int i = index; i < Math.min(products.length, index + 3); i++) {
                if (products[i].startsWith(prefix)) {
                    suggestions.add(products[i]);
                } else {
                    break;
                }
            }
            result.add(suggestions);
        }

        return result;
    }

    private int binarySearch(String[] products, String prefix) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = products.length;

        while (low < high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            if (products[mid].compareTo(prefix) < 0) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid;
            }
        }

        return low;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SearchSuggestionsSystem sss = new SearchSuggestionsSystem();
        String[] products = {"mobile", "mouse", "moneypot", "monitor", "mousepad"};
        String searchWord = "mouse";
        System.out.println(sss.suggestedProducts(products, searchWord));
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the Products:** `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of products.
- **Binary Search + Collecting Suggestions:** `O(m log n + m * 3)` where `m` is the length of `searchWord`. Traversing and binary search for each character in the searchWord is efficient.
- **Overall Time Complexity:** `O(n log n + m log n)` which is efficient for the given constraints.

This approach ensures that the solution is both efficient and readable, making it suitable for coding interviews.
