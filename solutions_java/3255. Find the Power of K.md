[Leetcode 3255. Find the Power of K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3255)
Sure, letâ€™s tackle this problem.

### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers and an integer `k`. A subarray is called k-size if the number of its elements is `k`. The power of a subarray is defined as the sum of its elements divided by the product of its elements. 

You need to return an array where each element at index `i` is the power of the `k-size` subarray starting from the index `i` in `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the input size?**
   - Typical constraints would be required to confirm the size of the input array `nums` could be up to 10^5, and `k` would be within the bounds of 1 < k <= length of `nums`.

2. **Can there be duplicate elements in the array?**
   - Assuming general cases of the input array, duplicates are allowed since no constraints prohibit them.

3. **How should divisions be handled?**
   - Specifying this is important to avoid precision issues. We may assume floating-point division is acceptable.

4. **Can subarrays be overlapping?**
   - Yes, subarrays can be overlapping, and the calculation needs to be done for each possible `k` sized segment of `nums`.

### Strategy

1. Create an array `result` to store the powers of the k-size subarrays.
2. Iterate through the array to extract each k-size subarray.
3. Calculate the sum and product for the subarray.
4. Compute the power (sum divided by product) and place the result in the appropriate index of `result`.
5. Return the `result` array.

### Code

Here's the Java code that implements the above strategy:

```java
public class FindPowerKSizeSubarrays {
    public static double[] findPowerOfKSizeSubarrays(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        double[] result = new double[n - k + 1];

        for (int i = 0; i <= n - k; i++) {
            int sum = 0;
            int product = 1;
            for (int j = i; j < i + k; j++) {
                sum += nums[j];
                product *= nums[j];
            }
            result[i] = (double) sum / product;
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int k = 3;
        double[] powers = findPowerOfKSizeSubarrays(nums, k);
        for (double power : powers) {
            System.out.println(power);
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Outer Loop:** Runs `n - k + 1` times to visit each start index of subarrays of size `k`.
- **Inner Loop:** For each subarray of size `k`, the loop runs `k` times to calculate the sum and product.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O((n - k + 1) * k), which simplifies to O(n * k).

### Edge Cases

1. **Minimum size constraints:** The function should handle smaller input sizes gracefully.
2. **Division by zero:** Although according to the problem statement, elements are positive, safeguarding against this adds robustness.
3. **Maximum constraints:** Ensure the function handles the upper limits effectively without timing out.

This approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the desired values with a clear focus on readability and adherence to constraints.
