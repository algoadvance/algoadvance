[Leetcode 2251. Number of Flowers in Full Bloom](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2251)
### Problem Statement

You are given two arrays: `flowers` and `persons`. The `flowers` array contains pairs of integers where the first integer is the start time (`start`) and the second integer is the end time (`end`) representing the time interval during which a flower is in full bloom. The `persons` array represents different times at which individuals are checking how many flowers are in full bloom.

You need to return an array `result` such that `result[i]` is the number of flowers in full bloom at time `persons[i]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What should be the output if `persons` array is empty?
   - If the `persons` array is empty, the output should be an empty array.

2. Are the intervals in the `flowers` array inclusive of `start` and `end`?
   - Yes, the intervals are inclusive.

3. Can the `flowers` and `persons` arrays contain duplicate entries?
   - The `persons` array can have duplicate entries. Each query in the `persons` array should be processed independently.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can employ a combination of sorting and binary search:

1. **Sorting**: Sort the `flowers` array by their start times, and also sort the end times separately.
2. **Binary Search**: For each time in the `persons` array, use binary search to count how many flowers have started blooming and how many have finished blooming up to that time.
3. **Counting**: Subtract the number of flowers that ended by `time` from those that started by `time` to get the number of flowers in full bloom at that specific time.

### Code

Here is the Java implementation for the described strategy:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.stream.Collectors;

public class FullBloomFlowers {
    
    public int[] fullBloomFlowers(int[][] flowers, int[] persons) {
        int n = flowers.length;
        int[] startTimes = new int[n];
        int[] endTimes = new int[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            startTimes[i] = flowers[i][0];
            endTimes[i] = flowers[i][1];
        }
        
        Arrays.sort(startTimes);
        Arrays.sort(endTimes);
        
        int[] result = new int[persons.length];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < persons.length; i++) {
            int time = persons[i];
            int flowersStarted = countLessEqual(startTimes, time);
            int flowersEnded = countLessEqual(endTimes, time - 1); // Exclude end time
            result[i] = flowersStarted - flowersEnded;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    private int countLessEqual(int[] array, int value) {
        int left = 0, right = array.length;
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            if (array[mid] <= value) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FullBloomFlowers solution = new FullBloomFlowers();
        int[][] flowers = // use example above
        int[] persons = {4, 5, 6, 7, 10};
        System.out.println(Arrays.stream(solution.fullBloomFlowers(flowers, persons))
                                 .boxed().collect(Collectors.toList())); // [2, 2, 1, 2, 1]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting**: Both sorting operations `Arrays.sort()` on start times and end times take \(O(n \log n)\).
2. **Binary Search**: Each binary search operation is \(O(\log n)\). Since we do this binary search for each person, the total complexity is \(O(m \log n)\), where \(m\) is the number of persons.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n + m \log n)\).

### Notes

- If the number of persons is much larger than the number of flowers, sorting and binary searching will be efficient.
- This approach leverages the properties of binary search to quickly count the required number of flowers in full bloom at any given time.
