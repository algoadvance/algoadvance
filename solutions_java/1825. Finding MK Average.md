[Leetcode 1825. Finding MK Average](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1825)
## Problem Statement:
You are given two integers `m` and `k`, and a stream of integers. You need to implement the `MKAverage` class that can do the following:

1. `MKAverage(int m, int k)` – Initializes the `MKAverage` object with an empty stream of integers and the two integers `m` and `k`.
2. `void addElement(int num)` – Inserts a new element `num` into the stream.
3. `int calculateMKAverage()` – Returns the average of the remaining `m-2k` elements after removing the smallest `k` elements and the largest `k` elements from the last `m` elements of the stream. When the number of elements in the stream is less than `m`, return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Q**: Can `m` and `k` be negative? Are there any constraints on these values?
   **A**: No, `m` and `k` will always be positive integers, and typically their values will be constrained as per the problem statement.
   
2. **Q**: What type of stream are we dealing with? Can it have negative numbers?
   **A**: Yes, the stream can contain negative numbers.
   
3. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the size of the numbers in the stream?
   **A**: The size of the numbers will typically be within the range of integers in Java.

## Strategy:
1. Use two deques or balanced containers to maintain the stream of the last `m` elements.
2. Use a min-heap and max-heap to efficiently remove the smallest and largest `k` elements.
3. Aggregate and maintain the sum of the middle `m-2k` elements for quick average calculation.

### Steps:
1. Maintain a queue to store the last `m` elements.
2. Use a min-heap to always have access to the smallest `k` elements.
3. Use a max-heap to always have access to the largest `k` elements.
4. Maintain a sum of the elements that are within the middle section (i.e., after removing smallest and largest `k` elements).
5. When `calculateMKAverage` is called, check if we have at least `m` elements, if not, return `-1`. Else return the precomputed or sum divided by the size of the middle section.

## Code:
```java
import java.util.*;

class MKAverage {
    private int m, k;
    private Queue<Integer> stream;
    private List<Integer> lastMElements;
    
    public MKAverage(int m, int k) {
        this.m = m;
        this.k = k;
        this.stream = new LinkedList<>();
        this.lastMElements = new ArrayList<>();
    }
    
    public void addElement(int num) {
        stream.add(num);
        if (stream.size() > m) {
            stream.poll();
        }
    }
    
    public int calculateMKAverage() {
        if (stream.size() < m) return -1;
        
        lastMElements.clear();
        for (int num : stream) {
            lastMElements.add(num);
        }
        Collections.sort(lastMElements);
        
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = k; i < m - k; i++) {
            sum += lastMElements.get(i);
        }
        
        return sum / (m - 2k);
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MKAverage obj = new MKAverage(3, 1);
        obj.addElement(3);
        obj.addElement(1);
        System.out.println(obj.calculateMKAverage()); // -1
        obj.addElement(10);
        System.out.println(obj.calculateMKAverage()); // 3
        obj.addElement(5);
        obj.addElement(5);
        System.out.println(obj.calculateMKAverage()); // 5
    }
}
```

## Strategy:
1. We use a Queue to keep the last `m` elements.
2. Each time we want to calculate MKAverage, we sort the last `m` elements and compute the sum by excluding the smallest and largest `k` elements.
3. The complexity of the `calculateMKAverage` involves sorting which is `O(m log m)`.

## Time Complexity:
1. **addElement**: O(1) - Adding to the queue.
2. **calculateMKAverage**: O(m log m) - Sorting the list of last `m` elements and summing up the middle elements.
