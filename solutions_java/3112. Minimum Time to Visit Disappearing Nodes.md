[Leetcode 3112. Minimum Time to Visit Disappearing Nodes full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3112)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of points `points` where each point is represented as an array of 2 integers `[xi, yi]`. The points represent nodes that appear and disappear at specific times. A point `[xi, yi]` appears at time `ai` and disappears at time `bi`. You need to find the minimum time required to visit all the nodes while considering their appearance and disappearance times.

Each move from one point to another takes 1 unit of time.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum value for the number of points?**
   - Helps determine if certain algorithms would be feasible.

2. **Is it guaranteed that it's possible to visit all points within their appearance and disappearance timeframes?**
   - Ensures that we are working with valid input.

3. **Can we revisit the same point?**
   - Determines if we need to keep track of already visited points multiple times.

4. **Will the node list always be sorted by their appearance time `ai`?**
   - Might simplify the problem as we can assume the order of appearance.

5. **Can the movement time between any two points be other than 1 unit of time?**
   - Confirms the understanding of the problem constraints.

### Strategy

1. **Sort by Appearance Time**: If the nodes are not given in order of their appearance time, first sort them by `ai`.

2. **Simulate Traveling**:
   - Start from the first node and try to visit the subsequent nodes while keeping track of the current time.
   - If a node's appearance time is greater than the current time, wait until that node appears.
   - Directly calculate the travel time to the next node.
   - Repeat until all nodes are visited or it is identified that the remaining nodes cannot be visited within their valid timespan.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the initial node disappears before any other node appears.
   - Check the feasibility of visiting all nodes within their allowed timespan.

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the nodes takes `O(n log n)`.
- Traversing through all the nodes takes `O(n)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.

### Code

Here is a Java implementation of the above strategy:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Comparator;

public class MinimumTimeToVisitNodes {
    
    public static int minTimeToVisitAllNodes(int[][] points) {
        // Sort points based on their appearance time
        Arrays.sort(points, new Comparator<int[]>() {
            public int compare(int[] a, int[] b) {
                return Integer.compare(a[2], b[2]); // compare by appearance time `ai`
            }
        });

        int time = 0;
        int x = 0, y = 0;
        for (int[] point : points) {
            int xi = point[0];
            int yi = point[1];
            int ai = point[2];
            int bi = point[3];
            
            // Wait until the point appears if necessary
            if (time < ai) {
                time = ai;
            }
            
            // Move to the next point
            time += Math.abs(x - xi) + Math.abs(y - yi);
            
            // Check if we can visit the point before it disappears
            if (time > bi) {
                return -1; // Not possible to visit this point within the time range
            }
            
            // Update current position
            x = xi;
            y = yi;
        }
        
        return time;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] points = {
            {1, 2, 5, 10},
            {3, 4, 6, 12},
            {5, 6, 7, 15}
        };
        
        int result = minTimeToVisitAllNodes(points);
        if (result == -1) {
            System.out.println("Not possible to visit all nodes within their appearance and disappearance times.");
        } else {
            System.out.println("Minimum time to visit all nodes: " + result);
        }
    }
}
```

This code takes an array of points, each with its coordinates and appearance/disappearance time, and calculates the minimum time required to visit all nodes under the given constraints.
