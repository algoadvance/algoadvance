[Leetcode 1104. Path In Zigzag Labelled Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1104)
## Problem Statement
In a binary tree, the root node is at depth `1`, and each subsequent depth `k` has `2^(k-1)` nodes. The tree is "perfect" binary tree. The goal is to find the path from the root node to a given node labeled with `label`, wherein:
- Nodes at depth `k` have labels in the range `[2^(k-1), 2^k - 1]`.
- The binary tree has a zigzag labeling, meaning the odd numbered depths have usual increasing order (left to right), while even numbered depths have decreasing order (right to left).

Given an integer `label`, return the path from the root to the given node as a list of integers.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the given label be greater than the maximum label in our binary tree of reasonable constraints?**
   - Assume the problem guarantees that the provided label is valid within the binary tree.

2. **Are there any constraints on the height of the tree or the value of the label to ensure efficient computation?**
   - Typically, we can assume a reasonable constraint for the tree height given standard problem constraints in LeetCode problems.

## Strategy
1. **Calculate the Depth of the Node with Given Label:**
   - Determine at which depth the node with the given label resides.
2. **Calculate the Path from the Node to the Root:**
   - Starting from the given node, trace back to the root by alternately moving parent node labels according to the depth.
   - Given the zigzag order, calculate parent-child relationship by adjusting for the mirrored nodes at even depth.
3. **Reverse the List:**
   - Since the traversal will start from the label back to the root, the list needs to be reversed at the end.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class ZigzagBinaryTreePath {
    public List<Integer> pathInZigZagTree(int label) {
        // List to store the result path
        List<Integer> path = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Calculate the depth of the node with the given label
        int depth = (int) (Math.log(label) / Math.log(2)) + 1;

        while (label > 0) {
            path.add(label);
            // Calculate the parent node in the current depth
            int maxVal = (1 << depth) - 1;
            int minVal = 1 << (depth - 1);
            label = (maxVal + minVal - label) / 2;
            depth--;
        }

        // Reverse the path to get the result from root to label
        Collections.reverse(path);
        return path;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n)
  - The algorithm calculates the depth in log time, then traces back each level to the root, resulting in a logarithmic number of operations relative to the label value.
- **Space Complexity:** O(log n)
  - The path list will store a logarithmic number of elements corresponding to the depth of the tree.

This completes the code for solving the path in a zigzag labeled binary tree problem efficiently.
