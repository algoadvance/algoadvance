[Leetcode 14. Longest Common Prefix full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l14)
## Problem Statement

The problem is to write a function to find the longest common prefix string among an array of strings. If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

### Example:
```
Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"

Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the expected output for an array containing only one string?
   - For example, `["flower"]`?
   - **Output**: The single string itself, "flower".

2. Should we handle the edge case of an empty array?
   - Yes. If the input array is empty, the function should return an empty string `""`.

3. What is the maximum size of the input array (number of strings), and the length of each string?
   - Let's assume typical constraints: the number of strings (`n`) could be up to 200 and the length of each string (`m`) could be up to 200 characters.

## Strategy

1. **Edge Cases Handling**:
    - If the array is empty, return an empty string.
    - If the array has only one string, return that string directly.

2. **Prefix Comparison Strategy**:
    - Start by assuming the first string in the array is the common prefix.
    - Iterate through the remaining strings and compare each string to the current common prefix. 
    - Update the common prefix by comparing each character until there's a mismatch.
    - If the common prefix becomes an empty string during the comparison, terminate as there's no common prefix.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
    - Initialize common prefix with the first string.
    - Iterate through each character of each subsequent string to update the common prefix.
    - Return the common prefix after processing all strings.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public String longestCommonPrefix(String[] strs) {
        if (strs == null || strs.length == 0) {
            return "";
        }
        
        // Start with the first string as the common prefix.
        String commonPrefix = strs[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < strs.length; i++) {
            commonPrefix = findCommonPrefix(commonPrefix, strs[i]);
            if (commonPrefix.isEmpty()) {
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return commonPrefix;
    }
    
    // Helper method to find common prefix between two strings
    private String findCommonPrefix(String str1, String str2) {
        int minLength = Math.min(str1.length(), str2.length());
        int i = 0;
        while (i < minLength && str1.charAt(i) == str2.charAt(i)) {
            i++;
        }
        return str1.substring(0, i);
    }
    
    // Main method for testing purposes
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        
        String[] strs1 = {"flower", "flow", "flight"};
        System.out.println("Test Case 1: " + solution.longestCommonPrefix(strs1)); // Expected output: "fl"
        
        String[] strs2 = {"dog", "racecar", "car"};
        System.out.println("Test Case 2: " + solution.longestCommonPrefix(strs2)); // Expected output: ""
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(S), where S is the sum of all characters in all strings. In the worst case, each character of all strings will be checked.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), no extra space is used other than a few variables.

This approach ensures efficient performance by progressively narrowing down the common prefix, checking only the necessary characters, and stopping early when a mismatch is found.
