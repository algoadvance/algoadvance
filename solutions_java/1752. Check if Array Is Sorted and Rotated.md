[Leetcode 1752. Check if Array Is Sorted and Rotated](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1752)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of distinct integers `nums`. You want to return `true` if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order and then rotated some number of positions (including zero). Otherwise, return `false`.

An array `A` is said to be sorted and rotated if there exists some positive integer `k` such that:

- After rotating `A` `k` positions, the array becomes sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the array length?**
   - The length of the array will be between 1 and 100, inclusive.
   
2. **Can the array be empty?**
   - No, the array will have at least one element.
   
3. **What is the range of the array elements?**
   - The elements in the array are distinct integers.

4. **Is the rotation allowed to be zero, meaning the complete array can be non-rotated but just sorted?**
   - Yes, an array which is simply sorted without rotation is considered sorted and rotated for k = 0.

### Strategy

1. **Identify the Sorted Part:**
   - Traverse the array and count the number of places where the next element is smaller than the current element. This will help us identify if the array is rotated.

2. **Check Valid Rotation:**
   - If the count of elements where the next element is smaller than the current element is more than 1, it can't be a valid rotation. If the count is exactly one, check if the remaining part of the array still respects the non-decreasing order.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean check(int[] nums) {
        int count = 0;
        int len = nums.length;

        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[(i + 1) % len]) {
                count++;
            }
            if (count > 1) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Loop through the Array:**
   - Traverse the array to find the number of places where the next element is smaller than the current element. Use modulo operation to consider the array as circular.
   
2. **Count Check:**
   - If the count is greater than 1, return `false` since it cannot be a valid rotated sorted array.
   - If the count is 0 or 1, return `true` indicating that the array is sorted and rotated.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the number of elements in the array because we only traverse the array once.
- The space complexity is **O(1)** as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This solution should effectively determine if the given array is sorted and rotated as per the problem statement.
