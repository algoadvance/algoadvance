[Leetcode 808. Soup Servings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l808)
### Problem Statement
The problem is taken from LeetCode (#808): "Soup Servings".

There are two types of soup: type A and type B. Initially, we have `N` ml of soup. There are four kinds of operations:

1. Serve 100 ml of soup A and 0 ml of soup B
2. Serve 75 ml of soup A and 25 ml of soup B
3. Serve 50 ml of soup A and 50 ml of soup B
4. Serve 25 ml of soup A and 75 ml of soup B

When we serve some soup, we consume the specified number of milliliters from soup A and soup B. After soup has been served, we consider the following events later:

- If both A and B become empty simultaneously, we treat that as 0.5 probability of serving the soup (since they are served equally).
- If A becomes empty while B is still non-empty, we treat that as 1.0 probability of serving.
- If B becomes empty first or both A and B are not empty after several servings, we treat that as 0 probability of serving.

Return the probability that soup A will be empty first, plus half the probability that A and B become empty at the same time.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What should be the behavior if `N` is very large?
2. Is there any limit to the size of `N` for which the precision should be accounted?

**Assumption**: For large values of `N`, the result is very close to 1.

### Strategy
1. Use memoization with recursion to avoid redundant calculations.
2. Adjust serving operations and base cases to keep track of the probabilities.
3. Use a dynamic programming approach to store intermediate results.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class SoupServings {
    private Map<String, Double> memo = new HashMap<>();

    public double soupServings(int N) {
        if (N > 4800) 
            return 1.0;
        
        return serve(N, N);
    }
    
    private double serve(int A, int B) {
        if (A <= 0 && B <= 0)
            return 0.5;
        if (A <= 0)
            return 1.0;
        if (B <= 0)
            return 0.0;
        
        String key = A + "," + B;
        if (memo.containsKey(key))
            return memo.get(key);
    
        double probability = 0.25 * (
            serve(A - 100, B) +
            serve(A - 75, B - 25) +
            serve(A - 50, B - 50) +
            serve(A - 25, B - 75)
        );
        
        memo.put(key, probability);
        return probability;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SoupServings solution = new SoupServings();
        System.out.println(solution.soupServings(50));  // Example input
        System.out.println(solution.soupServings(100)); // Example input
    }
}
```

### Strategy Explanation
1. **Memoization**: The `serve` function uses a `HashMap` to memorize previously computed values to avoid redundant calculations and retain the intermediate results.
2. **Base Cases**:
   - When both `A` and `B` are exhausted simultaneously, return `0.5`.
   - When only `A` is exhausted, return `1.0`.
   - When only `B` is exhausted, return `0.0`.
3. **Operations**: The four kinds of operations are recursively applied, and the resultant probability is averaged by multiplying by `0.25`.
4. **Large `N` optimization**: For large values (greater than 4800), the result is approximated to `1.0` due to diminishing probability differences.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is O(N^2) due to memoization, where `N` is the soup quantity in the worst case, noting that `N` in this context will be reduced by certain thresholds, making the number of effective calls intractable. This is efficient given memoized results are reused.
