[Leetcode 1169. Invalid Transactions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1169)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of transactions, where each transaction is represented as a string in the format `"name,time,amount,city"`. A transaction is considered invalid if:
1. The amount exceeds $1000, or
2. There exists another transaction with the same name within (and including) 60 minutes of the current transaction, but in a different city.

You need to return a list of invalid transactions. You may return the answer in any order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format**: Will each transaction be provided as a string in the format `"name,time,amount,city"` and all elements will be valid according to this format?
   - *Assumption*: Yes, all input strings follow the given format.

2. **Edge Cases**: Should we consider edge cases like:
   - Transactions exactly 60 minutes apart but in different cities,
   - Transactions with the amount exactly $1000?

   - *Assumption*: Yes, transactions exactly 60 minutes apart but in different cities should be considered invalid, and transactions with the amount exactly $1000 are valid.

### Strategy

1. **Parse Transactions**: First, convert each transaction string into a structured form (e.g., a list of objects or dictionaries) for easier processing.
2. **Check Conditions**:
   - **Amount Check**: Directly check if the amount exceeds $1000.
   - **Time and City Check**: Group transactions by name. For each transaction, check other transactions of the same name to see if there is one in a different city within 60 minutes.
3. **Recording Invalid Transactions**: Use a set to record invalid transactions to avoid duplicates.

### Code

Here's how you can implement this strategy in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class InvalidTransactions {
    public List<String> invalidTransactions(String[] transactions) {
        // Parse each transaction into structured data
        class Transaction {
            String name;
            int time;
            int amount;
            String city;
            String raw;

            Transaction(String transaction) {
                String[] parts = transaction.split(",");
                this.name = parts[0];
                this.time = Integer.parseInt(parts[1]);
                this.amount = Integer.parseInt(parts[2]);
                this.city = parts[3];
                this.raw = transaction;
            }
        }

        List<Transaction> transactionList = new ArrayList<>();
        for (String t : transactions) {
            transactionList.add(new Transaction(t));
        }

        Set<String> invalidTransactions = new HashSet<>();
        Map<String, List<Transaction>> transactionsByName = new HashMap<>();

        // Group transactions by name
        for (Transaction t : transactionList) {
            transactionsByName.putIfAbsent(t.name, new ArrayList<>());
            transactionsByName.get(t.name).add(t);
        }

        // Check each transaction for invalid conditions
        for (Transaction t : transactionList) {
            if (t.amount > 1000) {
                invalidTransactions.add(t.raw);
            }
            for (Transaction other : transactionsByName.get(t.name)) {
                if (!other.city.equals(t.city) && Math.abs(other.time - t.time) <= 60) {
                    invalidTransactions.add(t.raw);
                    invalidTransactions.add(other.raw);
                }
            }
        }

        return new ArrayList<>(invalidTransactions);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        InvalidTransactions solution = new InvalidTransactions();
        String[] transactions = {
            "alice,20,800,mtv",
            "alice,50,100,beijing",
            "alice,50,1200,mtv",
            "bob,20,1000,ny"
        };
        System.out.println(solution.invalidTransactions(transactions));
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Parsing Transactions**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of transactions.
- **Grouping Transactions**: \(O(n)\) for the initial pass to group transactions by name.
- **Checking Conditions**: In the worst case, each transaction's amount is checked and each pair of transactions for the same name might be compared, leading to \(O(n^2)\).

So the overall time complexity is \(O(n + n^2)\), which simplifies to \(O(n^2)\) in the worst case.

This approach ensures all invalid transactions are correctly identified and returned.
