[Leetcode 169. Majority Element](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l169)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times. You may assume that the majority element always exists in the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input array contain negative numbers or only positive numbers?**
   - The problem statement does not restrict the array to positive numbers only, so it can contain negative numbers as well.
   
2. **Is the input array always non-empty?**
   - Yes, as per the problem statement, we can assume the input array is always non-empty.

3. **What should be returned if there are multiple elements that meet the majority requirement?**
   - There can only be one element which is the majority element as per the problem definition (appears more than `⌊n / 2⌋` times).

### Strategy

There are multiple ways to solve this problem, but one of the most efficient methods is the Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm. This algorithm operates in linear time `O(n)` and requires constant space `O(1)`.

The Boyer-Moore Voting Algorithm works as follows:
1. Maintain a `candidate` for the majority element and a `count`.
2. Initialize `candidate` as `nums[0]` and `count` as 1.
3. Iterate through the array starting from the second element:
    - If `count` is 0, set the current element as the `candidate` and reset `count` to 1.
    - If the current element is the same as `candidate`, increment `count`.
    - Otherwise, decrement `count`.
4. The `candidate` at the end of iteration will be the majority element.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int majorityElement(int[] nums) {
        int candidate = nums[0];
        int count = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (count == 0) {
                candidate = nums[i];
                count = 1;
            } else if (nums[i] == candidate) {
                count++;
            } else {
                count--;
            }
        }

        return candidate;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {2,2,1,1,1,2,2};
        System.out.println(sol.majorityElement(nums));  // Output: 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. The array is traversed once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`. Only a few extra variables (`candidate` and `count`) are used regardless of the input size.

This approach ensures that we find the majority element efficiently with minimal use of resources.
