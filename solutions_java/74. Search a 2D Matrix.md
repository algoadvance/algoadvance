[Leetcode 74. Search a 2D Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l74)
### Problem Statement

Write an efficient algorithm that searches for a value in an `m x n` matrix. This matrix has the following properties:
- Integers in each row are sorted from left to right.
- The first integer of each row is greater than the last integer of the previous row.

You need to determine whether a target integer exists in the matrix or not.

#### Example:

```
Input: 
matrix = [
  [1, 3, 5, 7],
  [10, 11, 16, 20],
  [23, 30, 34, 60]
], 
target = 3

Output: true
```

```
Input: 
matrix = [
  [1, 3, 5, 7],
  [10, 11, 16, 20],
  [23, 30, 34, 60]
], 
target = 13

Output: false
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the matrix be empty?
2. Are there any constraints on the values in the matrix (e.g., only positive integers)?

### Strategy

The matrix properties indicate that it can be treated as a sorted array if we map its indices cleverly. To leverage this, we will use a binary search approach.

#### Steps:
1. Treat the matrix as a virtual sorted array.
2. Use binary search on this virtual array.
3. To translate the 1D binary search index to a 2D matrix index:
   - For row index: `row = mid / n` (integer division)
   - For column index: `col = mid % n` (remainder)

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(log(m * n)) because binary search is applied.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) since no additional space is used apart from variables.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean searchMatrix(int[][] matrix, int target) {
        if (matrix == null || matrix.length == 0 || matrix[0].length == 0) {
            return false;
        }

        int m = matrix.length;
        int n = matrix[0].length;
        int left = 0;
        int right = m * n - 1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            int midElement = matrix[mid / n][mid % n];

            if (midElement == target) {
                return true;
            } else if (midElement < target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[][] matrix = {
                {1, 3, 5, 7},
                {10, 11, 16, 20},
                {23, 30, 34, 60}
        };
        System.out.println(sol.searchMatrix(matrix, 3));   // true
        System.out.println(sol.searchMatrix(matrix, 13));  // false
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Boundary Check:** If the matrix is empty or any of its dimensions is zero, immediately return false.
2. **Binary Search Initialization:** Initialize `left` as 0 and `right` as `m * n - 1` to cover the entire virtual array.
3. **Binary Search Loop:**
   - Compute middle index `mid` and find the corresponding element in the matrix using `matrix[mid / n][mid % n]`.
   - Check if this middle element matches the target.
   - Adjust the search range based on whether the middle element is less than or greater than the target.
4. If the element is found, return true; otherwise, return false after the loop completes.

The approach ensures efficient searching with a logarithmic time complexity.
