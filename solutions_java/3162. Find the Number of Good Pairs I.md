[Leetcode 3162. Find the Number of Good Pairs I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3162)
### Problem Statement:

Given an array of integers `nums`, a pair `(i, j)` is called good if `nums[i] == nums[j]` and `i < j`. Write a function to return the number of good pairs in the array.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the size range of the array `nums`?
   - What is the range of values within the `nums` array? Are they all integer values?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should be returned if the array is empty?
   - Are all elements in the array unique, or can there be duplicates?

3. **Output:**
   - The output should be a single integer representing the number of good pairs.

### Strategy:

To solve this problem optimally, we can use a hash map (or dictionary) to keep track of the frequency of each number as we iterate through the list.

- As we iterate through the `nums` array:
  - For each number, count how many times we've seen it so far.
  - For each appearance of `nums[i]`, all previous identical values `nums[j]` (where `i > j`) form a good pair.
  
By keeping a frequency map and updating the count of good pairs on the fly, we can efficiently determine the number of good pairs without needing to check every possible pair explicitly.

### Time Complexity:

- The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. This is because we are iterating through the array once and using a hash map to store counts.
- The space complexity is also O(n) in the worst case where all elements are unique and thus stored in the map.

### Code:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public int numIdenticalPairs(int[] nums) {
        // HashMap to store frequency of elements
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> freqMap = new HashMap<>();
        int goodPairs = 0;

        // Iterate through the array
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (freqMap.containsKey(num)) {
                goodPairs += freqMap.get(num);
                freqMap.put(num, freqMap.get(num) + 1);
            } else {
                freqMap.put(num, 1);
            }
        }

        // Return the number of good pairs found
        return goodPairs;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 3};
        System.out.println(solution.numIdenticalPairs(nums)); // Output: 4
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a `HashMap` named `freqMap` to store the frequency of each number as we traverse the array.
   - Initialize `goodPairs` to 0 to keep count of good pairs.

2. **Iteration:**
   - For each number in the array `nums`:
     - Check if the number exists in the `freqMap`.
     - If it does, add the current count of that number (from the map) to `goodPairs` and increment its count in the map.
     - If it doesn't, add the number to the map with a count of 1.

3. **Output:**
   - Once the iteration is complete, return the value of `goodPairs`.

This approach ensures that we correctly count all good pairs efficiently.
