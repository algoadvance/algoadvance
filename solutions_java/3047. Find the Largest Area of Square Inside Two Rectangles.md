[Leetcode 3047. Find the Largest Area of Square Inside Two Rectangles](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3047)
Certainly! Let’s work through this step-by-step.

## Problem Statement
Given two rectangles in a 2D plane, you need to find the largest square that can fit inside the intersection area of these two rectangles.

Each rectangle is defined by its diagonal corners (x1, y1) and (x2, y2).

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the rectangle sides be parallel to the x and y axes only?
2. Do the rectangles overlap partially or fully?
3. What should be returned if there is no intersection between the two rectangles?

Let's assume that the rectangles are always axis-aligned (sides parallel to x and y axes), and the coordinates always form valid rectangles.

## Strategy
1. **Identify Intersection Area**: Calculate the coordinates of the bottom-left and top-right corners of the intersection area of the two rectangles.
2. **Calculate Intersection Dimensions**: From the intersection coordinates, derive the width and height of the intersection area.
3. **Determine Maximum Square Size**: The side length of the largest square fitting inside this intersection will be the minimum of the width and height of the intersection area.
4. **Handling Non-Intersection**: If there's no intersection, return 0.

### Intersection Calculation
For two rectangles defined by diagonals:
- Rectangle 1: (x1, y1) to (x2, y2)
- Rectangle 2: (x3, y3) to (x4, y4)

The intersection area would be:
- Bottom-left Corner:   
  \[ ( \text{max}(x1, x3), \text{max}(y1, y3) ) \]
- Top-right Corner: 
  \[ ( \text{min}(x2, x4), \text{min}(y2, y4) ) \]

### Checking Valid Intersection
Ensure the intersection forms a valid rectangle (bottom-left x ≤ top-right x and bottom-left y ≤ top-right y).

## Code
Here is the Java code to solve this problem:

```java
public class LargestSquareArea {
    public static int largestSquareInsideIntersection(int[] rect1, int[] rect2) {
        // rect1 and rect2 both are expected as {x1, y1, x2, y2}
        int x1 = rect1[0], y1 = rect1[1], x2 = rect1[2], y2 = rect1[3];
        int x3 = rect2[0], y3 = rect2[1], x4 = rect2[2], y4 = rect2[3];

        // Calculate intersection coordinates
        int intersectLeftX = Math.max(x1, x3);
        int intersectBottomY = Math.max(y1, y3);
        int intersectRightX = Math.min(x2, x4);
        int intersectTopY = Math.min(y2, y4);

        // Check if there is a valid intersection
        if (intersectLeftX < intersectRightX && intersectBottomY < intersectTopY) {
            int width = intersectRightX - intersectLeftX;
            int height = intersectTopY - intersectBottomY;
            // The largest square that can fit has a side equal to the minimum of width and height
            return Math.min(width, height);
        } else {
            // No intersection
            return 0;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] rect1 = {1, 1, 4, 4};
        int[] rect2 = {2, 2, 6, 6};
        System.out.println(largestSquareInsideIntersection(rect1, rect2)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(1)** because it involves a constant number of comparison and arithmetic operations.

This solution assumes that input always gives the correct and well-formed rectangles with valid coordinates.
