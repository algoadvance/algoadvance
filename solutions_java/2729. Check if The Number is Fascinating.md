## Problem Statement

**2729. Check if The Number is Fascinating**

You are given an integer `n` and a fascinating number is a number such that when it is multiplied by 1, 2, and 3, and the results are concatenated together in order, all the digits from 1 to 9 are present exactly once. 

For example:
- `192` is a fascinating number because `192` * 1 = `192`, `192` * 2 = `384`, and `192` * 3 = `576`, and `192384576` contains all the digits from 1 to 9 exactly once.
- `100` is not a fascinating number as the concatenation `100200300` contains multiple zeros and doesn't contain some other digits.

Given an integer `n`, return `true` if it is a fascinating number, or `false` otherwise.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of n**: Are there any constraints on the value of `n`?
   - **Assumption**: Typically, such problems would have a range constraint like `1 <= n <= 10^4` but this needs to be confirmed.
  
2. **Negative numbers**: Are negative numbers considered in this problem?
   - **Assumption**: Typically, fascinating numbers would be positive integers.

3. **Return type**: Should we return `true`/`false` as a boolean?
   - **Assumption**: Yes, the output is expected to be a boolean.

## Strategy

1. **Generate and Concatenate**: Calculate `n * 1`, `n * 2`, and `n * 3`. Concatenate these results into a single string.
   
2. **Verify Digits**: Ensure that the concatenated string contains exactly nine distinct digits without any repetition, and that these digits are exactly 1 through 9.

3. **Immediate Validation**: If the length of the concatenated string is not 9, return `false` immediately as it cannot be valid.

## Time Complexity

- The solution involves basic arithmetic operations and string manipulations which are constant time (O(1) for multiplication and constant-time for string concatenations due to fixed lengths).
- Checking the string for the exact digits and uniqueness involves linear scans through a fixed-length string.

Hence, the overall time complexity is O(1), as the operations work on fixed-size data.

## Implementation

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean isFascinating(int n) {
        // Generate the concatenated string
        String concatenated = "" + n + (n * 2) + (n * 3);
        
        // If the length of concatenated string is not 9, it's not fascinating
        if (concatenated.length() != 9) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // We need every digit from 1 to 9 to appear exactly once
        boolean[] digits = new boolean[10];
        
        for (char ch : concatenated.toCharArray()) {
            int digit = ch - '0';
            // If the digit is 0 or already seen, return false
            if(digit == 0 || digits[digit]) {
                return false;
            }
            digits[digit] = true;
        }
        
        // Ensure all digits from 1 to 9 are seen exactly once
        for (int i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
            if (!digits[i]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

You can use this code to determine if a given number `n` is a fascinating number by calling `isFascinating(n)` with the desired integer value. The solution ensures precise verification in constant time.
