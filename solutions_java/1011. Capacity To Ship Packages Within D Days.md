[Leetcode 1011. Capacity To Ship Packages Within D Days](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1011)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `weights` representing the weights of packages, and an integer `days` which represents the number of days within which all the packages need to be shipped. You need to find the least weight capacity of a ship that will result in all the packages being shipped within the given `days`.

Each day, the ship can be loaded with weight on that day as long as the cumulative weight does not exceed the ship's weight capacity. The ship can be loaded on `days` consecutive days.

You want to minimize the ship's weight capacity, ensuring all packages can be shipped within the given number of days.

Example:

```plaintext
Input: weights = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10], days = 5
Output: 15
Explanation: A ship with capacity 15 is able to ship the packages in 5 days like this:
  1st day: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5
  2nd day: 6, 7
  3rd day: 8
  4th day: 9
  5th day: 10

Note that the total weight of packages carried each day is less than or equal to 15.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are all package weights positive integers?**
   - Yes, all weights are positive integers.
2. **Is the order of the weights in the array fixed?**
   - Yes, the order in which packages are given cannot be rearranged.
3. **Is it guaranteed that it is possible to ship all packages within the given days?**
   - Yes, it is guaranteed that it is possible.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a binary search strategy to find the minimum capacity of the ship:
1. **Define the search space for the ship's capacity**:
   - The minimum capacity the ship could have is the weight of the heaviest package (`max(weights)`), because the ship must be able to carry the heaviest package.
   - The maximum capacity is the sum of all the package weights (`sum(weights)`), which would mean carrying all packages in one day.

2. **Binary search**:
   - Use binary search between the minimum and maximum capacity. 
   - For each midpoint capacity, check if it's possible to ship all packages within the given days with this capacity.
   - Adjust the search space based on whether the current midpoint capacity can fulfill the requirements.

3. **Feasibility check function**:
   - Implement a helper function to determine if all packages can be shipped within the given days with a specified ship capacity.

### Code
Here is the implementation in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int shipWithinDays(int[] weights, int days) {
        int left = getMax(weights);
        int right = getSum(weights);
        
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (left + right) / 2;
            if (canShip(weights, days, mid)) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        return left;
    }
    
    private int getMax(int[] weights) {
        int max = 0;
        for (int weight : weights) {
            max = Math.max(max, weight);
        }
        return max;
    }
    
    private int getSum(int[] weights) {
        int sum = 0;
        for (int weight : weights) {
            sum += weight;
        }
        return sum;
    }
    
    private boolean canShip(int[] weights, int days, int capacity) {
        int currentLoad = 0;
        int daysNeeded = 1;
        
        for (int weight : weights) {
            if (currentLoad + weight > capacity) {
                daysNeeded++;
                currentLoad = 0;
            }
            currentLoad += weight;
        }
        
        return daysNeeded <= days;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Binary Search**:
  - The binary search runs in `O(log(sum(weights) - max(weights)))` iterations.
- **Feasibility Check**:
  - Each feasibility check involves a single pass through the `weights` array, which is `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the `weights`.

Combining these, the overall time complexity is `O(n * log(sum(weights) - max(weights)))`.

This solution effectively narrows down the minimum ship capacity needed using binary search and validates each potential capacity in linear time.
