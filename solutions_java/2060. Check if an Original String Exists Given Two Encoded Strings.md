[Leetcode 2060. Check if an Original String Exists Given Two Encoded Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2060)
### Problem Statement
You are given two strings `s1` and `s2`, both of which represent the encoded versions of some original string. The encoding rule is straightforward:

- Each digit `d` in the string expands to `d` repeated characters of that string.
- For example, "3a2b" when decoded would become "aaabb".

Your task is to determine if there exists an original string that could be encoded into both `s1` and `s2`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What are the lengths of the two strings `s1` and `s2`?
   **A:** The lengths of `s1` and `s2` can vary but will be reasonably small (e.g., less than 1000 characters).

2. **Q:** Can the digits in the encoded strings be greater than 9?
   **A:** Yes, digits can be multi-digit numbers.

3. **Q:** Is the input guaranteed to be a valid encoded string?
   **A:** Yes, the input is guaranteed to be a valid encoded string as per the problem statement.

### Strategy
To determine if there exists an original string that can be encoded into both `s1` and `s2`, we can use a recursive (or dynamic programming) approach to simulate all possible decodings of `s1` and `s2`.

1. **Recursive Function:** The function will process segments of `s1` and `s2`. If it cannot find a matching segment in the current position, it should backtrack and try alternative segmentations.
2. **Base Condition:** If both strings are processed completely at the same time, then a matching original string exists.
3. **When Processing a Digit:** When encountering digits, expand them by keeping track of both the segment length and the corresponding character.

### Code

Here's a Java implementation of the above strategy:

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean possiblyEquals(String s1, String s2) {
        return helper(s1, 0, s2, 0, 0);
    }
    
    private boolean helper(String s1, int i, String s2, int j, int diff) {
        if (i >= s1.length() && j >= s2.length()) {
            return diff == 0;
        }
        
        if (i >= s1.length()) {
            return validateSegment(s2, j, diff);
        }
        if (j >= s1.length()) {
            return validateSegment(s1, i, -diff);
        }
        
        if (Character.isDigit(s1.charAt(i))) {
            int digit = 0;
            for (int k = i; k < s1.length() && Character.isDigit(s1.charAt(k)); k++) {
                digit = digit * 10 + (s1.charAt(k) - '0');
                if (helper(s1, k + 1, s2, j, diff + digit)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        } else if (Character.isDigit(s2.charAt(j))) {
            int digit = 0;
            for (int k = j; k < s2.length() && Character.isDigit(s2.charAt(k)); k++) {
                digit = digit * 10 + (s2.charAt(k) - '0');
                if (helper(s1, i, s2, k + 1, diff - digit)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        } else {
            if (diff == 0 && s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(j) && helper(s1, i + 1, s2, j + 1, diff)) {
                return true;
            }
            return diff != 0 && (helper(s1, i + 1, s2, j, diff - 1) || helper(s1, i, s2, j + 1, diff + 1));
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    private boolean validateSegment(String s, int index, int segmentLength) {
        int digit = 0;
        for (int k = index; k < s.length(); k++) {
            if (Character.isDigit(s.charAt(k))) {
                digit = digit * 10 + (s.charAt(k) - '0');
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        return digit == segmentLength;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is difficult to precisely determine due to the recursive nature of the problem and the need to explore many potential paths in the input strings. However, the complexity is exponential concerning the length of input strings, which makes the worst-case scenario O(2^(M+N)), where M and N are the lengths of `s1` and `s2`.

The space complexity is primarily driven by the recursion stack depth, which in the worst-case scenario can be O(M+N).
