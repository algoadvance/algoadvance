[Leetcode 2440. Create Components With Same Value](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2440)
### Problem Statement
You are given a connected undirected graph consisting of `n` vertices numbered from `0` to `n-1` and `n-1` edges. The graph does not contain any cycles or multiple edges. You want to divide the graph into `k` non-overlapping connected components and assign an integer value to each component such that the sum of the values of all components is the same. Can you achieve this?

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Details**: What form is the graph provided in? Adjacency list, matrix, or edge list?
   - **Answer**: Typically, the input will be an edge list, given the constraint that there are `n-1` edges for `n` nodes.
   
2. **Output Requirements**: What exactly should be returned?
   - **Answer**: Return `true` if it's possible to divide the graph into `k` components with the sum of component values being the same. Return `false` otherwise.
   
3. **Values of Nodes**: What values should each node have initially?
   - **Answer**: The graph node value details are not provided; assume each node has a value of `1` unless specified otherwise.

### Strategy
The key here is to determine if you can partition the graph such that each partition has the same sum of values. Given each node has value `1`, the total sum, `S`, of all nodes is `n` (since there are `n` nodes).

Steps:
1. Find the sum of the values of all nodes, which is `n`.
2. Check if `n` can be evenly divided by `k` (i.e., `n % k == 0`), implying that each component should have a sum of `n / k`.
3. Use Depth First Search (DFS) to check if the graph can be partitioned into `k` components each having the derived sum (`n / k`).

### Code
We'll now write the Java code to perform the above logic.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public boolean componentValue(int[] nums, int[][] edges, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        
        if (n % k != 0) {
            return false;
        }

        int targetSum = n / k;
        int[] parent = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(parent, -1);

        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph.put(i, new ArrayList<>());
        }
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            graph.get(edge[0]).add(edge[1]);
            graph.get(edge[1]).add(edge[0]);
        }

        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];

        return dfs(graph, visited, 0, targetSum) == 0;
    }

    private int dfs(Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph, boolean[] visited, int node, int targetSum) {
        visited[node] = true;
        int currentSum = 1;

        for (int neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                currentSum += dfs(graph, visited, neighbor, targetSum);
            }
        }

        if (currentSum == targetSum) {
            return 0;
        }
        return currentSum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1};
        int[][] edges = // use example from above
        int k = 3;
        System.out.println(sol.componentValue(nums, edges, k)); // Output should be true
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
This solution primarily involves running a DFS traversal on the graph:
- **Construction of the graph**: `O(n) + O(n-1) = O(n)`
- **DFS traversal**: `O(n)`

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n)` given that constructing the graph and dfs traversal both occur linearly with respect to the number of nodes.
