[Leetcode 2862. Maximum Element](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2862)
## Problem Statement

2862. **Maximum Element-Sum of a Complete Subset of Indices**

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. Consider a subset of indices `S` such that `0 <= i < S.length`. A subset `S` is called a complete subset if, for every `i` in `S`, every number `j` such that `0 <= j < i` is also in `S`. 

For example, if `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, a complete subset can be `{0, 1, 2}` but not `{1, 2, 3}`, because `0` is not included in the latter subset.

Given a non-empty integer array `nums`, return the maximum possible sum of elements based on any complete subset of indices of `nums`.

### Constraints
- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-1000 <= nums[i] <= 1000`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Are negative numbers allowed in the array?
    - **A**: Yes, `nums[i]` can be between `-1000` and `1000`.

2. **Q**: Can the input array be empty?
    - **A**: No, the array will always have at least one element as per the constraints.

3. **Q**: What is the minimum and maximum value for `nums.length`?
    - **A**: The length of the array will be between 1 and 1000 inclusive.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to identify complete subsets. For a subset `S` to be complete, it should contain all indices from `0` to `k` for some `k`.

Thus, the problem boils down to finding the maximum sum of all possible prefixes of the array `nums`. This can be efficiently done using a single pass through the array to calculate prefix sums and track the maximum value encountered.

Steps:
1. Initialize a variable `currentSum` to 0 to keep track of the sum of elements in the current complete subset.
2. Initialize a variable `maxSum` to `Integer.MIN_VALUE` to keep track of the highest sum encountered.
3. Iterate over each element in the array, updating `currentSum`.
4. After adding each element to `currentSum`, update `maxSum` if `currentSum` is greater.
5. Return `maxSum` as the result.

## Code

Here is the implementation in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxElementSum(int[] nums) {
        int currentSum = 0;
        int maxSum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            currentSum += num;
            if (currentSum > maxSum) {
                maxSum = currentSum;
            }
        }
        
        return maxSum;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. This is because we are only making a single pass through the array to calculate the prefix sums and determine the maximum sum.

The space complexity is `O(1)` as we are using only a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
