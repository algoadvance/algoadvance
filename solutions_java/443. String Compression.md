[Leetcode 443. String Compression](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l443)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of characters `chars`, compress it in-place. The length after compression must always be smaller than or equal to the original array. Every element of the array should be a single character not a string of length 1.

The compressed string should be returned in the form of a new length of the array.

After you are done modifying the input array in-place, return the new length of the array.

The input array is a list of characters. Each character should be compressed as per the following rules:
- If a character appears consecutively more than once, it should be replaced by the character followed by the number of times it consecutively appears.
- If a character appears only once, it remains as is and is not followed by a number.

### Example
``` 
Input: chars = ["a","a","b","b","c","c","c"]
Output: Return 6, and the first 6 characters of the input array should be: ["a","2","b","2","c","3"]

Input: chars = ["a"]
Output: Return 1, and the first 1 character of the input array should be: ["a"]

Input: chars = ["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]
Output: Return 4, and the first 4 characters of the input array should be: ["a","b","1","2"]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are the input arrays always non-empty?
   **A:** Yes, you can assume the input array has at least one character.
   
2. **Q:** What should be done if the compressed length is longer than the original length?
   **A:** The problem guarantees that the compressed length will not be longer than the original length.

3. **Q:** Should the returned length consider only the compressed array or the entire size of the array including trailing unused elements?
   **A:** The returned length should consider only the compressed array.

### Strategy
- Use two pointers: `write` will track where to write the compressed result and `read` will iterate over the characters.
- Use a loop to count consecutive characters.
- Compress each group of consecutive characters by writing the character followed by its count if greater than 1.
- Convert the count to characters and write them into the array.
- Once processed all characters, return the `write` pointer value as the new length.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the `chars` array. Each character is read and written at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we're modifying the array in place and using a constant amount of extra space.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int compress(char[] chars) {
        int write = 0, read = 0;
        while (read < chars.length) {
            char currentChar = chars[read];
            int count = 0;

            // Count occurrence of the character
            while (read < chars.length && chars[read] == currentChar) {
                read++;
                count++;
            }

            // Write the character
            chars[write++] = currentChar;

            // Write the count if greater than 1
            if (count > 1) {
                for (char c : Integer.toString(count).toCharArray()) {
                    chars[write++] = c;
                }
            }
        }
        return write;
    }
}
```

### Explanation
- `write` is the index at which to write the next element.
- `read` is the current index being read.
- The outer `while` loop continues until all characters in the array have been processed.
- Count occurrences of the current character `currentChar` using the inner `while` loop.
- Write each character and its count (if greater than 1) to `chars` array at the `write` position(s).
- Convert count to characters by transforming it into a string and then iterating over the stringâ€™s characters to write them into `chars`.
- Finally, return `write` which indicates the new length of the compressed string.
