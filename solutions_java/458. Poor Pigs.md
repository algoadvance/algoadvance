[Leetcode 458. Poor Pigs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l458)
### Problem Statement
We are given `buckets` of liquid, where exactly one of the buckets is poisonous. To figure out which one is poisonous, we can use some pigs for a specific procedure and we have a `minutesToDie` which indicates how long it takes for a pig to die after drinking from a poisoned bucket, and a `minutesToTest` which indicates how long we have to test all buckets. 

The goal is to uncover the minimum number of pigs required to determine which specific bucket is poisoned within the timeframe given. 

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the pigs be reused after they die?**
   - No, each pig can only be used once.
2. **Is there a limit on the number of buckets?**
   - No, the number of buckets can be any positive integer.
3. **What is the relationship between `minutesToDie` and `minutesToTest`?**
   - The total number of test cycles we can perform is `minutesToTest / minutesToDie`.

With these parameters in mind, we need to determine the minimal number of pigs required to identify the poisonous bucket.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, let's break down the steps:

1. **Temporal Analysis:**
   - We need to test all buckets within `minutesToTest`. Each pig can only test as many times as `minutesToTest / minutesToDie`.

2. **Dimensional Analysis:**
   - Each pig adds a dimension to our testing matrix, where each pig's state (alive or dead) can provide a result contributing to a different "testing dimension".

3. **Formula Approach:**
   - Each pig can test up to `(minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1)` state changes (either they die or they don't in each time segment).
   - If there's only one pig, and `minutesToTest / minutesToDie` = k, then we can test in `k+1` different states (`Handling Deaths 0 to k` returns).
   - For `n` pigs, the total combinations we can test is `(k+1)^n`.

4. **Decision Making:**
   - We need to find the smallest number `n` such that `(k+1)^n` is at least `buckets`. This translates directly to the smallest number of pigs required.

### Code
Here's how we implement the above logic in Java:

```java
public class PoorPigs {
    public int poorPigs(int buckets, int minutesToDie, int minutesToTest) {
        int attempts = minutesToTest / minutesToDie + 1;
        int pigs = 0;
        while (Math.pow(attempts, pigs) < buckets) {
            pigs++;
        }
        return pigs;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PoorPigs solution = new PoorPigs();
        System.out.println(solution.poorPigs(1000, 15, 60)); // Example usage
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of required pigs. Given that each iteration performs a constant-time calculation involving `Math.pow()`, which is efficient, the main loop runs until finding the minimum number of pigs satisfying the buckets' requirements.

### Summary
By determining the number of testing states each pig can endure, we can calculate the fewest pigs necessary to identify the poisoned bucket. This method ensures that within the given constraints, the solution is optimal and efficient.
