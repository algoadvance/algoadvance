[Leetcode 2249. Count Lattice Points Inside a Circle full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2249)
### Problem Statement

You are provided with multiple circles on a 2D plane. Each circle is defined by its center coordinates `(x, y)` and radius `r`. You need to count all unique lattice points (points with integer coordinates) that lie inside at least one of the given circles, including the boundaries.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:** Is there a specific limit on the number of circles, or the values of coordinates and radii?
   - Generally, assume small to moderate constraints unless specified.

2. **Circle Definition:** Does the circle include its boundary?
   - Yes, points on the boundary are counted as inside the circle.

### Strategy

1. **Brute Force Approach:**
   - Iterate over each circle and consider all points within the bounding box of the circle.
   - For each point in the bounding box, check if it lies within the circle using the equation of the circle `(x - cx)^2 + (y - cy)^2 <= r^2`.
   - Use a `Set` to store unique lattice points.

2. **Bounding Box:**
   - For a circle centered at `(cx, cy)` with radius `r`, the points to check range from `(cx - r, cy - r)` to `(cx + r, cy + r)`.

3. **Efficiency Considerations:**
   - The solution involves iterating over possible points within the bounding box, which may become inefficient for large radii or many circles. However, since we are counting lattice points, this brute-force method should be feasible for moderate constraints.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class CountLatticePointsInsideCircle {
    public static int countLatticePoints(int[][] circles) {
        Set<String> uniquePoints = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (int[] circle : circles) {
            int cx = circle[0];
            int cy = circle[1];
            int r = circle[2];
            
            // Evaluate the bounding box
            for (int x = cx - r; x <= cx + r; x++) {
                for (int y = cy - r; y <= cy + r; y++) {
                    // Check if point (x, y) is inside the circle
                    if ((x - cx) * (x - cx) + (y - cy) * (y - cy) <= r * r) {
                        // Use the string representation to ensure unique points
                        uniquePoints.add(x + "_" + y);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        // The size of the set is the number of unique lattice points
        return uniquePoints.size();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] circles = {{2, 2, 1}, {3, 4, 1}};
        System.out.println(countLatticePoints(circles)); // Output: Expected number of unique lattice points
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Bounding Box Iteration:** For each circle, the bounding box dimensions are `2r+1` by `2r+1`, so iterating over each point takes `O(r^2)`.
- **Set Operations:** Checking and adding to the set are average O(1) operations.
- **Overall Complexity:** If `n` is the number of circles and `r` is the average radius, the time complexity is `O(n * r^2)`.

### Space Complexity

- **Set Storage:** The space complexity is proportional to the number of unique lattice points which is O(k) where `k` is the number of unique lattice points.

This approach is simple and effective for moderate-sized inputs. For large inputs, optimizations or more sophisticated geometry algorithms might be considered.
