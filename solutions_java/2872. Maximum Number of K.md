[Leetcode 2872. Maximum Number of K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2872)
## Problem Statement

Given a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph with no cycles) with `n` nodes and edges, and an integer `k`, your task is to find the maximum number of connected components in the tree such that the sum of the values of nodes in each component is divisible by `k`. Each node has a value. 

**The nodes and their values are given as:**
- `values: int[]` representing the values of each node
- `edges: List<List<Integer>>` representing the edges of the tree

**The objective is to return an integer representing the maximum number of connected components that are `k`-divisible.**

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Nature of Tree:** Confirm that it's a standard undirected tree with `n` nodes where `n-1` edges are given.
2. **Node Values:** Confirm that the node values are integers and can be positive, negative, or zero.
3. **Edge Representation:** Are edges represented as pairs where each pair `[u, v]` indicates an undirected edge between nodes `u` and `v`?
4. **Constraints:** What are the constraints on `n` and the range of node values?

## Strategy

1. **Convert the Edges to an Adjacency List:** Set up an adjacency list to represent the tree.
2. **DFS to Check Divisibility:** Use depth-first search (DFS) to traverse the tree:
    - For each subtree, check if the sum of its node values is divisible by `k`.
    - If divisible, increment the component count and reset the subtree sum for further checks.
3. **Component Count Handling:**
    - Track the resulting sum at each node post DFS to determine if it can form a valid divisible component when adding up from its subtrees.
4. **Return the Count:** The component count collected throughout the DFS traversal will give the maximum number of `k`-divisible components.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MaxKDivisibleComponents {
    
    public int maxKDivisibleComponents(int[] values, List<List<Integer>> edges, int k) {
        int n = values.length;
        List<List<Integer>> adjacencyList = new ArrayList<>(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            adjacencyList.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        
        for (List<Integer> edge : edges) {
            int u = edge.get(0), v = edge.get(1);
            adjacencyList.get(u).add(v);
            adjacencyList.get(v).add(u);
        }
        
        int[] count = {0};
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        dfs(0, -1, values, adjacencyList, k, visited, count);
        return count[0];
    }

    private int dfs(int u, int parent, int[] values, List<List<Integer>> adjacencyList, int k, boolean[] visited, int[] count) {
        visited[u] = true;
        int currentSum = values[u]; // Start with the value of the current node.
        
        for (int v : adjacencyList.get(u)) {
            if (v != parent && !visited[v]) {
                currentSum += dfs(v, u, values, adjacencyList, k, visited, count);
            }
        }
        
        if (currentSum % k == 0) {
            count[0]++;
            return 0; // Reset the sum as this component can be considered k-divisible.
        }
        
        return currentSum;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **DFS Traversal:** O(n) where `n` is the number of nodes because each node and edge is visited once.
- **Building Adjacency List:** O(n) as there are `n-1` edges.
- **Overall Complexity:** O(n)

In the worst case, we process each node and edge once for a linear time complexity relative to the number of nodes.
