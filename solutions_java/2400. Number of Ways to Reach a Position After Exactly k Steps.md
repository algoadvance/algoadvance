[Leetcode 2400. Number of Ways to Reach a Position After Exactly k Steps full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2400)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integers `startPos` and `endPos` representing the starting and ending positions on a number line. You are also given an integer `k`, which represents the exact number of steps you must take. At each step, you can move either `1` unit to the left or `1` unit to the right. Your task is to determine the number of distinct ways you can reach the position `endPos` from `startPos` in exactly `k` steps. 

Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on Input Sizes:**
   - What are the possible ranges for `startPos`, `endPos`, and `k`?

   - **Response**: Typically, constraints will be provided in the problem. For example, `-1000 <= startPos, endPos <= 1000` and `0 <= k <= 1000`.

2. **Direction of Moves:**
   - Can moves be only in exact `1` unit steps to the left or right?

   - **Response**: Yes, movements are restricted to exactly `1` unit steps to either left or right.

3. **Optimal Approach:**
   - Are we considering an optimal dynamic programming solution due to the constraints?

   - **Response**: Yes, a dynamic programming approach is likely required.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - Use a 2D DP table `dp[steps][position]` where `dp[steps][position]` represents the number of ways to reach the `position` after `steps` steps.

2. **Base Case**:
   - `dp[0][startPos]`: There is exactly one way to be at `startPos` in 0 steps, i.e., do nothing.

3. **Recursive Transition**:
   - For each step `i` from `1` to `k`, and each possible position `pos`:
     - `dp[i][pos]` would be the sum of `dp[i-1][pos-1]` (ways to reach `pos` from `pos-1`) and `dp[i-1][pos+1]` (ways to reach `pos` from `pos+1`).

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since results can be large, use modulo `10^9 + 7` to keep numbers manageable.

5. **Final Answer**:
   - The result would be `dp[k][endPos]`.


### Code

```java
public class NumberOfWays {
    public int numberOfWays(int startPos, int endPos, int k) {
        int MOD = 1000000007;
        int maxPosition = 3000; // considering the range is ample for start and end position
        int offset = 1500; // offset to handle negative indices
        
        // dp[i][j] means number of ways to reach position j-offset at i steps
        int[][] dp = new int[k+1][maxPosition];
        
        dp[0][startPos + offset] = 1; // base case
        
        for (int step = 1; step <= k; step++) {
            for (int pos = 0; pos < maxPosition; pos++) {
                if (pos - 1 >= 0) {
                    dp[step][pos] = (dp[step][pos] + dp[step-1][pos-1]) % MOD;
                }
                if (pos + 1 < maxPosition) {
                    dp[step][pos] = (dp[step][pos] + dp[step-1][pos+1]) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[k][endPos + offset];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NumberOfWays solution = new NumberOfWays();
        System.out.println(solution.numberOfWays(1, 2, 3)); // Replace with actual test case
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(k \times P)\), where \(k\) is the number of steps and \(P\) is the range of possible positions considered.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(k \times P)\), due to the DP table.

This approach ensures an efficient way to calculate the possible number of ways by leveraging the dynamic programming paradigm.
