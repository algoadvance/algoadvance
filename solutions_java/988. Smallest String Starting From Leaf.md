[Leetcode 988. Smallest String Starting From Leaf](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l988)
### Problem Statement
You are given the root of a binary tree where each node has a value between `0` and `25` inclusive. Each value corresponds to a letter in the alphabet where `0 = 'a'`, `1 = 'b'`, and so on. A leaf of a tree is a node that has no children.

The string associated with a leaf node is a string that starts with the leaf's character and ends at the root's character. As all strings start from the leaf point to the root of the tree, we need to find and return the lexicographically smallest string among all possible leaf to root paths in the tree.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input:** Can we assume that the input is always a valid binary tree?
   - Yes, the input will always be a valid binary tree.
2. **Output:** Should the output be the smallest lexicographical string possible?
   - Yes, return the smallest lexicographical string among all leaf to root paths.
3. **Constraints:** What is the expected size of the tree?
   - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 8500]`.
   - The value of each node is between `0` and `25`.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we should use Depth First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree. We'll start from the root and traverse all paths to the leaf nodes. While traversing, we will build strings by appending the character corresponding to each nodeâ€™s value, thus creating string paths from the leaf to the root.

- We maintain a global variable to keep track of the lexicographically smallest string encountered.
- For each path during traversal, we reverse the string (since we're building it from leaf to root) and compare it with the current smallest string.
- Update the smallest string if the current string is smaller lexicographically.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    private String smallest = "~"; // Initialize to a character beyond 'z' to ensure any found will be smaller

    public String smallestFromLeaf(TreeNode root) {
        dfs(root, new StringBuilder());
        return smallest;
    }

    private void dfs(TreeNode node, StringBuilder sb) {
        if (node == null) {
            return;
        }

        // Prepend the current node's character to the path string
        sb.insert(0, (char) ('a' + node.val));

        // If it's a leaf node, compare the current path string with the smallest found so far
        if (node.left == null && node.right == null) {
            String currentPath = sb.toString();
            if (currentPath.compareTo(smallest) < 0) {
                smallest = currentPath;
            }
        } else {
            // Continue DFS traversal
            if (node.left != null) dfs(node.left, sb);
            if (node.right != null) dfs(node.right, sb);
        }

        // Remove the character added when going back up the tree
        sb.deleteCharAt(0);
    }

    // TreeNode definition
    public static class TreeNode {
        int val;
        TreeNode left;
        TreeNode right;
        TreeNode() {}
        TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
        TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
            this.val = val;
            this.left = left;
            this.right = right;
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(N^2), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This is due to the string manipulations (specifically, prepending characters) at each node in the worst case.
- **Space Complexity:** O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This space is used by the recursion stack and the StringBuilder content in the worst case when the tree is highly unbalanced.

This approach ensures that we examine all possible leaf-to-root paths and accurately determine the smallest lexicographically string among them.
