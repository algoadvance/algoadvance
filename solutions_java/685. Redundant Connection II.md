[Leetcode 685. Redundant Connection II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l685)
# Problem Statement

In this problem, a directed graph is given with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`. Each edge is a directed edge from `ui` to `vi` in the form of a 2D-array edges, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` represents a directed edge from node `ui` to node `vi`.

A node is a redundant connection if removing it would result in a graph that is still a tree. We need to find and return only one such redundant directed connection.

# Clarifying Questions

1. Will there always be exactly one redundant directed edge in the input graph?
2. Can the graph contain self-loops or duplicate edges?
3. Should the output be the edge that causes the issue or the nodes involved in the redundant connection?

Assuming the answers:
1. Yes, there will be exactly one redundant edge.
2. No self-loops or duplicate edges.
3. The output should be the edge that is causing the redundant connection.

# Strategy

The problem can be approached by considering two possible scenarios:
1. There is a node with two parents.
2. The graph contains a cycle.

**Steps to solve the problem:**
1. **Check for two parents scenario:**
   - Iterate through the edges to identify any node with two parents.
   - Temporarily remove each edge involving the node with two parents to check if the resulting graph becomes a valid tree.
   
2. **Cycle Detection:**
   - Use Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union) to detect if adding an edge creates a cycle in the graph.
   - If a cycle is detected, that edge is potentially redundant unless we have already found a node with two parents, in which case adjusting our approach for the two parents takes precedence.

**Union-Find approach:** 
- Initialize parent and rank arrays to manage the connections.
- For each edge, union the nodes and detect if they belong to the same set, indicating a cycle.

# Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int[] findRedundantDirectedConnection(int[][] edges) {
        int n = edges.length;
        int[] parent = new int[n + 1];
        int[] candA = null, candB = null;

        // Step 1: Check for nodes with two parents
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0], v = edge[1];
            if (parent[v] == 0) {
                parent[v] = u;
            } else {
                // Node v has two parents
                candA = new int[] {parent[v], v};
                candB = new int[] {u, v};
                edge[1] = 0;  // Temporarily invalidate candB edge
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Union-Find to detect cycle after ignoring candB if any
        UnionFind uf = new UnionFind(n);
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            if (edge[1] == 0) continue;
            int u = edge[0], v = edge[1];
            if (!uf.union(u, v)) {
                if (candA == null) {
                    return edge;
                } else {
                    return candA;
                }
            }
        }

        // If we reach here, there was no cycle detected in the main graph
        return candB;
    }

    class UnionFind {
        private int[] parent, rank;

        public UnionFind(int size) {
            parent = new int[size + 1];
            rank = new int[size + 1];
            for (int i = 1; i <= size; i++) parent[i] = i;
        }

        public int find(int u) {
            if (parent[u] != u) parent[u] = find(parent[u]);
            return parent[u];
        }

        public boolean union(int u, int v) {
            int rootU = find(u), rootV = find(v);
            if (rootU == rootV) return false;

            if (rank[rootU] > rank[rootV]) {
                parent[rootV] = rootU;
            } else {
                parent[rootU] = rootV;
                if (rank[rootU] == rank[rootV]) rank[rootV]++;
            }
            return true;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[][] edges = // use example from above
        int[] result = sol.findRedundantDirectedConnection(edges);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(result));  // Output should be [2, 3]
    }
}
```

# Time Complexity

1. Building the parent array: O(n)
2. Union-Find operations: near O(n) due to path compression and union by rank

Overall, the solution runs in O(n) time complexity, which should be efficient for this problem.
