[Leetcode 23. Merge k Sorted Lists](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l23)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of `k` linked-lists `lists`, each linked-list is sorted in ascending order.

Merge all the linked-lists into one sorted linked-list and return it.

The problem can be found [here](https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-k-sorted-lists/).

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What will be the value of k?**
   - `k` can vary from 0 to 10^4.
2. **What will be the size of each linked-list in the array?**
   - Each linked list can be of varying size. The size can go up to 500.
3. **Can the linked list contain duplicate values?**
   - Yes, the linked lists can contain duplicate values.
4. **What should be returned if the input array is empty or contains only empty linked-lists?**
   - An empty linked list should be returned in such cases.

### Strategy

1. **Min-Heap (Priority Queue):**
   - Use a min-heap to efficiently get the smallest element from the heads of the lists.
   - Insert the head of each non-empty linked list into the min-heap.
   - Extract the smallest element, append it to the merged linked list, and push the next element from the extracted element's list into the min-heap.
   - Continue this process until the heap is empty.

This approach ensures that we are always merging the smallest available elements efficiently using the properties of the min-heap.

### Code

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode(int x) {
        val = x;
        next = null;
    }
}

public class Solution {
    public ListNode mergeKLists(ListNode[] lists) {
        if (lists == null || lists.length == 0) return null;

        PriorityQueue<ListNode> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a.val - b.val);

        // Initialize the heap with the head of each list
        for (ListNode head : lists) {
            if (head != null) {
                minHeap.offer(head);
            }
        }

        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode tail = dummy;
        
        while (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
            ListNode minNode = minHeap.poll();
            tail.next = minNode;
            tail = minNode;

            if (minNode.next != null) {
                minHeap.offer(minNode.next);
            }
        }

        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initial Heap Construction:** O(k log k)
  - Inserting the first node of each list into the heap.

- **Heap Operations:**
  - Each insertion and deletion operation on the heap takes `O(log k)`.
  - We need to perform these operations for each of the `n` total nodes in all the lists combined.

Thus, the total time complexity is **O(n log k)**, where `n` is the total number of nodes in all the linked lists combined and `k` is the number of linked lists.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is **O(k)** due to the storage of the nodes in the priority queue (min-heap) and the additional space used by the dummy node and pointers.
