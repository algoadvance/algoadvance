[Leetcode 60. Permutation Sequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l60)
## Problem Statement

The set \( [1, 2, 3, \ldots, n] \) contains a total of \( n! \) unique permutations.

Given `n` and `k`, return the \( k \)-th permutation sequence.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of `n` and `k`:** What is the range for the values of `n` and `k`?
   - **Answer:** Typically, `1 <= n <= 9` and `1 <= k <= n!`, since 9! is 362,880 which is manageable in terms of computation.

2. **Indexing of `k`:** Is `k` 1-based or 0-based?
   - **Answer:** `k` is 1-based as per the common problem statement for such problems.

3. **Return type:**
   - **Answer:** The function should return a string representing the \( k \)-th permutation sequence.

## Strategy

1. **Factorial Calculation:** The idea is based on the factorial number system.
    - Calculate the factorial values for the numbers 1 through `n-1` to help in determining the blocks of permutations.
2. **Block Identification:** Use the calculated factorial values to identify which block of permutations the \( k \)-th permutation falls into.
3. **Sequential Selection:**
    - Use `k` to determine the index of the current digit, and remove the selected digit from the list, updating `k` accordingly for the next iteration.
4. **Iterative Reduction:** Iterate by reducing the size of the problem by one in each step until you form the required permutation.

## Implementation

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class PermutationSequence {
    
    public String getPermutation(int n, int k) {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        List<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<>();
        int[] factorial = new int[n + 1];

        // Create an array of factorial lookup
        factorial[0] = 1; // 0! = 1
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            factorial[i] = factorial[i - 1] * i;
        }

        // Create a list of numbers to get indices
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            numbers.add(i);
        }

        // Convert k to be zero-indexed
        k--;

        // Form the k-th permutation
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            int index = k / factorial[n - i];
            result.append(numbers.get(index));
            numbers.remove(index);
            k -= index * factorial[n - i];
        }

        return result.toString();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PermutationSequence ps = new PermutationSequence();
        System.out.println(ps.getPermutation(3, 3)); // Expected Output: "213"
        System.out.println(ps.getPermutation(4, 9)); // Expected Output: "2314"
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity can be analyzed as follows:
1. **Factorial computation:** \(O(n)\), since we compute the factorial values for `n` numbers.
2. **Permutation computation:** The loop runs `n` times, and each time removing an element from the list of size reducing from `n` to `1` takes \(O(n)\) in the worst case.

Thus, the overall time complexity is approximately \(O(n^2)\).

## Conclusion

This solution efficiently calculates the \( k \)-th permutation sequence using factorial properties and list manipulations, providing an optimal way to address the problem with a reasonable time complexity given the constraints.
