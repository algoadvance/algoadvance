[Leetcode 976. Largest Perimeter Triangle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l976)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return the largest perimeter of a triangle with a non-zero area, formed from three of these lengths. If it is impossible to form any triangle of a non-zero area, return `0`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [2,1,2]
Output: 5
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,1]
Output: 0
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of inputs?**
   - The array length ranges from 3 to 10^4 and each number ranges from 1 to 10^6.
   
2. **Can the array contain duplicate numbers?**
   - Yes, duplicates are allowed.

3. **What is the desired performance?**
   - Ideally, we should aim for an O(n log n) solution due to sorting, as typical constraints can go up to 10^4 numbers.

## Strategy

1. **Sort the Array:**
   - First, sort the array in non-decreasing order.
   
2. **Iterate from the End:**
   - Iterate over the sorted array from the end towards the beginning. This helps in quickly finding the largest perimeter by checking the largest values first.

3. **Triangle Inequality:**
   - For any three sides to form a triangle, the sum of any two sides must be greater than the third one:
     \[
     A + B > C
     \]
   - Therefore, in a sorted array, for the sides `nums[i-2]`, `nums[i-1]`, and `nums[i]`, we only need to check if:
     \[
     nums[i-2] + nums[i-1] > nums[i]
     \]

4. **Return the Perimeter:**
   - Return the perimeter of the first valid triangle found by this method. If no such triangle exists, return 0.

## Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class LargestPerimeterTriangle {
    public int largestPerimeter(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        for (int i = nums.length - 1; i >= 2; i--) {
            if (nums[i - 2] + nums[i - 1] > nums[i]) {
                return nums[i - 2] + nums[i - 1] + nums[i];
            }
        }
        return 0;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LargestPerimeterTriangle lpt = new LargestPerimeterTriangle();
        // Test case 1
        int[] nums1 = {2, 1, 2};
        System.out.println(lpt.largestPerimeter(nums1)); // Output: 5
        
        // Test case 2
        int[] nums2 = {1, 2, 1};
        System.out.println(lpt.largestPerimeter(nums2)); // Output: 0
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** The array is sorted first, which takes `O(n log n)`.
- **Iteration:** The iteration through the array to check for a valid triangle takes `O(n)`.

Overall, the time complexity is **`O(n log n)`**, which is efficient for the given problem constraints.
