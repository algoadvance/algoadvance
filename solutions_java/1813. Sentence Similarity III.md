[Leetcode 1813. Sentence Similarity III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1813)
### Problem Statement

Given two sentences `sentence1` and `sentence2`, each represented as a string of space-separated words, determine if one sentence can be made identical to the other by inserting an arbitrary sentence (possibly empty) of other words into one of their gaps.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format:**
   - Could the sentences contain leading or trailing spaces?
   - Are both sentences guaranteed to be non-empty?

2. **Output Format:**
   - Should the function return a boolean value (`true` or `false`) indicating if the sentences can be made identical?

3. **Constraints:**
   - What are the maximum lengths of the two sentences?
   - Are there any special characters in words, or are they alphanumeric?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can implement the following strategy:

1. **Split Sentences into Words:**
   - Split `sentence1` and `sentence2` by spaces to extract individual words.

2. **Two Pointer Technique:**
   - Use two pointers to compare the words from the start and end of each sentence.
   - Increment the starting pointer if words match from the beginning.
   - Decrement the ending pointer if words match from the end.
   - Ensure that all unmatched words in the larger sentence occur within the gap boundaries defined by the smaller sentence.

3. **Check Identical Conditions:**
   - If the two pointers from both ends intersect or cross each other, it implies the sentences can be made identical by omitting the mismatched middle part.

### Code Implementation

```java
public class SentenceSimilarity {
    public boolean areSentencesSimilar(String sentence1, String sentence2) {
        String[] words1 = sentence1.trim().split("\\s+");
        String[] words2 = sentence2.trim().split("\\s+");
        
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        int len1 = words1.length, len2 = words2.length;
        
        // Start comparing from the beginning
        while (i < len1 && i < len2 && words1[i].equals(words2[i])) {
            i++;
        }
        
        // Start comparing from the end
        while (j < len1 - i && j < len2 - i && words1[len1 - 1 - j].equals(words2[len2 - 1 - j])) {
            j++;
        }
        
        // Check if we have matched all words or left a valid mid-gap
        return i + j >= len1 || i + j >= len2;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SentenceSimilarity similarity = new SentenceSimilarity();

        String sentence1 = "My name is Haley";
        String sentence2 = "My Haley";
        System.out.println(similarity.areSentencesSimilar(sentence1, sentence2));  // true

        sentence1 = "ofi";
        sentence2 = "hey ofi";
        System.out.println(similarity.areSentencesSimilar(sentence1, sentence2));  // false

        sentence1 = "of";
        sentence2 = "of of";
        System.out.println(similarity.areSentencesSimilar(sentence1, sentence2));  // true
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n + m)**, where `n` is the number of words in `sentence1` and `m` is the number of words in `sentence2`. This is because we at most traverse each word in both sentences once (from both the start and end). The space complexity is **O(n + m)** as well due to the storage of split words in arrays.
