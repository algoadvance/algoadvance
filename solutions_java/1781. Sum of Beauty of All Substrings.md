[Leetcode 1781. Sum of Beauty of All Substrings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1781)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s`. The **beauty** of a substring is the difference in frequencies between the most and least frequent characters. 

For example, the beauty of the substring `"abaacc"` is `3 - 1 = 2`.

Return the total beauty of all substrings of the string `s`.

### Example

**Input:**
```plaintext
s = "aabcb"
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
5
```

**Explanation:**
The substrings with non-zero beauty are:
- `"aab"` -> `1`
- `"bbc"` -> `1`
- `"bcb"` -> `1`
- `"abab"` -> `2`
The sum of these beautities is `5`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Length of string `s`:**
   - What is the maximum length of the input string `s`?
   - **Answer:** The length of the string `s` can be up to `500`.

2. **Character Set:**
   - Can the string contain special characters or is it limited to lowercase alphabetical characters?
   - **Answer:** The string will only contain lowercase English letters.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should be the output if the input string is empty or has a single character?
   - **Answer:** If the input string is empty or has a single character, the output should be `0` since there are no valid substrings with a beauty score.

## Strategy

1. **Iterate Over All Substrings:**
   - For each substring, compute the frequency of its characters.
   - Calculate beauty by subtracting the least frequent character count from the most frequent character count.

2. **Optimization Insight:**
   - We can avoid recomputing frequencies from scratch for each substring starting from each character. Use a frequency array and update it as we grow the substring.

3. **Frequency Array Approach:**
   - Maintain a frequency array of size `26` (for each alphabet character) initialized to `0`.
   - Update the histogram by including one character at a time, updating max and min frequencies dynamically.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int beautySum(String s) {
        int totalBeauty = 0;
        int n = s.length();
        
        // Iterate over all possible starting points of substrings
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int[] freq = new int[26];
            // Extend the substrings starting from index i
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                freq[s.charAt(j) - 'a']++; // Increment the frequency of the current character
                totalBeauty += calculateBeauty(freq);
            }
        }
        
        return totalBeauty;
    }
    
    // Function to calculate the beauty given the frequency array
    private int calculateBeauty(int[] freq) {
        int maxFreq = 0;
        int minFreq = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (int count : freq) {
            if (count > 0) {
                if (count > maxFreq) maxFreq = count;
                if (count < minFreq) minFreq = count;
            }
        }
        
        return maxFreq - minFreq;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** 
  - The outer loop runs `O(n)` times (for each starting index).
  - The inner loop also runs `O(n)` times in total (considering extension of substrings).
  - Inside the inner loop, calculating beauty involves `O(26)` operations which can be considered as constant time `O(1)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n^2)`.

- **Space Complexity:** 
  - We use a frequency array of fixed size `26`, making the extra space use `O(1)`.

This makes the solution efficient enough for the given constraints (up to `500` characters).

This code will calculate the desired sum of beauties for all substrings in the given string `s`.
