[Leetcode 1968. Array With Elements Not Equal to Average of Neighbors](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1968)
## Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` of `n` integers where `n > 1`, return a new array `result` such that `result[i]` is not equal to the average of `result[i-1]` and `result[i+1]` for all valid `i` (0 < i < n-1).

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can elements be rearranged in any order?**
   Yes, you can rearrange the elements in any order to achieve the requirement.
  
2. **Does the new array need to be the same length as the original `nums` array?**
   Yes, the `result` array must have the same length as the input array `nums`.

3. **Are there any constraints on the values within the input array?**
   The problem doesn't specify constraints beyond the usual integer ranges, so you can assume the input array `nums` contains integers within typical bounds (e.g., -10^4 to 10^4).

## Strategy
1. **Sort the Array**: Sort the input array `nums`.
2. **Interleave the Elements**: Divide the array into two halves. Use a greedy approach to interleave elements from the two halves such that the condition is satisfied.

The idea behind sorting is that by interleaving the first half (smaller elements) and the second half (larger elements), we can avoid the scenario where an element is equal to the average of its neighbors.

## Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int[] rearrangeArray(int[] nums) {
        // Sort the input array first
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        
        // Create a new array to store the result
        int[] result = new int[nums.length];
        
        // Split the array into two halves
        int mid = (nums.length + 1) / 2;
        
        int j = 0;
        // Alternate elements from first and second half
        for (int i = 0; i < mid; i++) {
            result[j] = nums[i];
            if (j + 1 < nums.length) {
                result[j + 1] = nums[mid + i];
            }
            j += 2;
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {1,2,3,4,5};
        int[] result = sol.rearrangeArray(nums);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(result)); // Expected output could be [1, 4, 2, 5, 3] or similar
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the input array `nums`.
- **Rearranging**: The rearrangement step involves a single pass through the array, which takes \(O(n)\).

Overall, the time complexity of the entire algorithm is \(O(n \log n)\).

Please note that while this approach ensures that the adjacent elements' average condition is not violated, there might be multiple valid rearrangements possible. The given solution guarantees one such valid arrangement.
