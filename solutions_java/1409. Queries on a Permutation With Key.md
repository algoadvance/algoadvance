[Leetcode 1409. Queries on a Permutation With Key](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1409)
### Problem Statement

You are given the array queries of size `m`, which contains the integers between `1` and `m` (inclusive). You also have an initial permutation `P` of size `m`, which is a permutation of the integers from `1` to `m` in the initial order.

For each `queries[i]`, apply the following operations in sequence:

1. Find the index of `queries[i]` in the permutation `P`.
2. Move `queries[i]` to the front of `P`.
3. Record the index (0-indexed) in the result.

Return an array of the result for each query.

### Clarifying Questions

1. How large can the array `queries` and the integer `m` be?
2. Should the indices in the result array also be 0-indexed?
3. Does the order mentioned initially for the permutation `P` mean `[1, 2, 3, ..., m]`?

Given these assumptions and understanding, let's proceed with the implementation.

### Strategy

1. Start with the permutation `P = [1, 2, 3, ..., m]`.
2. Iterate through each query in `queries`.
3. For each query:
   - Find the index of the element in the permutation `P`.
   - Save the index to the result list.
   - Move the queried element to the front of `P`.
4. Return the result list after processing all queries.

### Time Complexity

- Searching for an element in a list requires O(m) time.
- Moving an element to the front of the list has a time complexity of O(m) (considering worst-case for shifting elements).

Thus, for `queries` with size `n` and permutation of size `m`, the overall time complexity is O(n * m).

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int[] processQueries(int[] queries, int m) {
        List<Integer> P = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            P.add(i);
        }
        
        int[] result = new int[queries.length];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < queries.length; i++) {
            int query = queries[i];
            int index = P.indexOf(query);  // Find the index of the query in P
            result[i] = index;             // Save the index to result
            
            // Move the queried element to the front of P
            P.remove(index);
            P.add(0, query);
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] queries = {3, 1, 2, 1};
        int m = 5;
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(sol.processQueries(queries, m)));  // Output: [2, 1, 2, 1]
    }
}
```

In this implementation:
- We initialize the permutation `P` as a `List<Integer>` from 1 to `m`.
- For each query, we find the index of the query in `P`, record it, and then move the element to the front of `P`.
- Finally, the result array is returned after processing all queries.
