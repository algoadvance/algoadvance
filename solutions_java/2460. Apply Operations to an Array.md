[Leetcode 2460. Apply Operations to an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2460)
### Problem Statement

You are given a `0-indexed` array `nums` of `size n` consisting of non-negative integers.

You need to apply `n - 1` operations to this array where, in the `i-th (0 <= i < n - 1)` operation, you will apply the following on the `i-th` element of `nums`:
- If `nums[i] == nums[i + 1]`, then assign the value of `nums[i]` to `2 * nums[i]`, and set `nums[i + 1]` to `0`.

After completing all the operations, shift all `0's` to the end of the array.

Return the resulting array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we do if the array is empty?**
   - Since all elements are non-negative integers and the problem doesn't specify any constraints about empty arrays, we can assume the array won't be empty.

2. **Are we allowed to modify the input array directly?**
   - Yes, modifying the input array directly is fine as we need to return the transformed array.

3. **How should we handle edge cases like a single-element array?**
   - For a single-element array, no operations will be performed, and the output should be the same as the input.

### Strategy

1. **Perform Pairwise Operations:** Iterate through the array from left to right and apply the given operation (`nums[i] == nums[i + 1]`).
2. **Shift Non-Zeros:** Create a new array to store non-zero elements first, followed by zeroes.
3. **Result Formation:** Construct the resultant array by first adding non-zero numbers found and then adding the requisite number of zeroes at the end.

Here's the implementation of the stated strategy:

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] applyOperations(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        
        // Apply operations (nums[i] == nums[i + 1])
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == nums[i + 1]) {
                nums[i] *= 2;
                nums[i + 1] = 0;
            }
        }

        // Create an array to store the result
        int[] result = new int[n];
        int index = 0; // Index for the result array
        
        // Add all non-zero elements from the modified nums to result
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num != 0) {
                result[index++] = num;
            }
        }
        
        // The rest of the elements will be zero by default (as array initialized to zeros)
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        
        // Test example
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0};
        int[] result = sol.applyOperations(nums);
        
        // Print the result
        for (int num : result) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Pairwise Operation Step:** This involves one complete pass through the array, so it is **O(n)**.
- **Shifting Non-Zero Elements:** This involves another pass through the array to collect non-zero elements and form the final array - resulting in **O(n)**.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input array. This is optimal given that we need to process each element at least once.
