[Leetcode 122. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l122)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `ith` day. On each day, you may decide to buy and/or sell the stock. You can only hold at most one share of the stock at any time. However, you can buy it then immediately sell it on the same day. Find the maximum profit you can achieve.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can transactions be made multiple times?**
   Yes, you can buy and sell multiple times but can hold at most one share at a time.
   
2. **Are there any transaction fees?**
   No, there are no transaction fees.

3. **Can we engage in multiple transactions in a single day?**
   Yes, you can buy and sell on the same day.

## Strategy
To maximize the profit, you should consider gaining profit from every increase in stock price from one day to the next. You can effectively create a strategy by summing up all the positive differences between each consecutive pair of days. This approach works because buying on the local low and selling on the local high within any time frame will always yield the optimal profit.

### Steps:
1. Initialize a variable `maxProfit` to store the accumulated profit.
2. Iterate through the `prices` array from the second day onwards.
3. For each day, compare the price with the previous day's price.
4. If today's price is higher than yesterday's price, add the difference (today's price - yesterday's price) to `maxProfit` (since this denotes a profit opportunity).
5. Return the total `maxProfit`.

## Code
```java
public class BestTimeToBuyAndSellStockII {

    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int maxProfit = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (prices[i] > prices[i - 1]) {
                maxProfit += prices[i] - prices[i - 1];
            }
        }
        return maxProfit;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BestTimeToBuyAndSellStockII solution = new BestTimeToBuyAndSellStockII();
        int[] prices = {7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4};
        System.out.println(solution.maxProfit(prices)); // Output: 7
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the `prices` array, because we only need to iterate through the array once.

The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
