[Leetcode 1946. Largest Number After Mutating Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1946)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `num` representing a large integer and an array of integers `change` of length 10, you can apply changes to the string `num` according to the following rule:

- For every digit `d` in the string `num`, you can change the digit `d` to `change[d]`.

However, you can only mutate a substring (i.e., a part of `num`) once by applying the operations on each digit of the substring. Once you start mutating a digit and change it according to `change`, you must continue changing all the subsequent digits until you decide to stop.

Your task is to find the largest possible number you can get after mutating exactly one substring.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - The length of `num` (denoted as `n`) is in the range `[1, 10^5]`.
   - Each character in `num` is a digit `0-9`.
   - The array `change` has length 10, and each element is a digit `0-9`.

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Return the largest possible integer string after mutation.

3. **Behavior on Boundary Values:**
   - Clarify what should happen when the input number is already the largest possible, e.g., `9999999` with `change = [9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9,9]`.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Iterate through each digit in `num` to identify the start of the potential substring mutation.
   
2. **Mutation Decision:**
   - For each digit, compare it with its corresponding `change[d]` value from the `change` array.
   - Once a `change[d]` value is greater than the digit `d`, start mutating.
   - Continue mutating as long as the subsequent digits can be improved (i.e., `change[d] >= d`).

3. **Stopping the Mutation:**
   - Stop the mutation once a mutation would result in a decrease (`change[d] < d`).
   - Ensure only one contiguous substring is mutated.

4. **Edge Conditions:**
   - Consider the entire string might need no mutation if `num` is already optimal.

### Code

Here is the Java code to accomplish this:

```java
public class LargestNumberAfterMutatingSubstring {
    public String maximumNumber(String num, int[] change) {
        char[] chars = num.toCharArray();
        boolean mutated = false; // flag to check if we have started mutating
        
        for (int i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {
            int originalDigit = chars[i] - '0';
            int mutatedDigit = change[originalDigit];
            
            if (mutatedDigit > originalDigit) {
                chars[i] = (char) (mutatedDigit + '0');
                mutated = true;
            } else if (mutatedDigit < originalDigit) {
                if (mutated) {
                    break;
                }
                // else, continue without setting mutated to true
            }
            // If mutatedDigit == originalDigit, continue with mutated flag status
        }
        
        return new String(chars);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage:
        LargestNumberAfterMutatingSubstring solver = new LargestNumberAfterMutatingSubstring();
        String num = "132";
        int[] change = {9,８,５,0,３,6,9,1,2,0};
        System.out.println(solver.maximumNumber(num, change)); // Expected output should be based on the example
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string `num`. This is because the solution involves a single pass through the string to determine where to begin and end the mutation.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for storing the character array (which is necessary for string manipulation).

This approach ensures that we are efficient with both time and space while solving the problem optimally for large inputs.
