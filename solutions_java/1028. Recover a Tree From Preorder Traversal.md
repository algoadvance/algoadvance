[Leetcode 1028. Recover a Tree From Preorder Traversal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1028)
### Problem Statement
You are given the string `traversal` which represents a tree in a special form of preorder traversal where each node's value is an integer, and every depth level is denoted by the number of dashes `-` preceding the integer. The depth level of the root node is 0, and nodes do not have explicit depth levels more than the value indicated in the string. You are required to recover the tree from this traversal string.

For example:
```
Input: traversal = "1-2--3--4-5--6--7"
Output: [1, 2, 5, 3, 4, 6, 7]
```
The above input string represents the following binary tree:
```
      1
    /   \
   2     5
  / \   / \
 3   4 6   7
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum possible length of the input string?
   - Can the tree contain nodes with the same value?
   - Are there any constraints on the value of the nodes?
   
2. **Output Format:**
   - Would you prefer the output as a TreeNode object or as a list representing the preorder traversal?
   
3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Should we assume the input string is always valid and well-formed as per the problem statement?

### Strategy
1. **Parse the Input String:**
   - Iterate through the string to parse each node's value and its corresponding depth based on the leading dashes.

2. **Build the Tree:**
   - Use a stack to keep track of the tree nodes corresponding to each depth.
   - For each parsed node, pop the stack to find its parent and attach it as a child, then push it to the stack.

3. **Output the Tree:**
   - Return the root of the constructed tree.

### Code
Here is the implementation of the above strategy:
```java
import java.util.*;

class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

public class Solution {
    public TreeNode recoverFromPreorder(String traversal) {
        if (traversal == null || traversal.length() == 0) {
            return null;
        }

        Deque<TreeNode> stack = new LinkedList<>();
        int i = 0;
        
        while (i < traversal.length()) {
            // Determine the current depth by counting consecutive dashes.
            int level = 0;
            while (i < traversal.length() && traversal.charAt(i) == '-') {
                level++;
                i++;
            }
            
            // Determine the node's value.
            int value = 0;
            while (i < traversal.length() && Character.isDigit(traversal.charAt(i))) {
                value = value * 10 + (traversal.charAt(i) - '0');
                i++;
            }
            
            TreeNode node = new TreeNode(value);
            
            // Adjust stack to current depth-level.
            while (stack.size() > level) {
                stack.pop();
            }
            
            // Attach node to its parent.
            if (!stack.isEmpty()) {
                TreeNode parent = stack.peek();
                if (parent.left == null) {
                    parent.left = node;
                } else {
                    parent.right = node;
                }
            }
            
            // Push current node to stack.
            stack.push(node);
        }
        
        // The first node in the stack is the root of the tree.
        while (stack.size() > 1) {
            stack.pop();
        }
        
        return stack.peek();
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Parsing the String:** O(N) - where N is the length of the traversal string. Each character is processed exactly once.
- **Building the Tree:** O(N) - each node is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(N)**.

### Space Complexity
- The space required for the stack is proportional to the depth of the tree, which in the worst case could be O(N). Thus, the space complexity is also **O(N)**.
