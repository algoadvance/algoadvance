[Leetcode 2053. Kth Distinct String in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2053)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of strings `arr`, and an integer `k`, return the kth distinct string in the array. If there are fewer than `k` distinct strings, return an empty string `""`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = ["d","b","c","b","c","a"], k = 2
Output: "a"
Explanation:
The distinct strings in arr are ["d","b","c","a"].
"b" and "c" are not distinct since they appear more than once.
The 2nd distinct string is "a".
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = ["aaa","aa","a"], k = 1
Output: "aaa"
Explanation:
All strings in arr are distinct, so the 1st distinct string is "aaa".
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= k <= arr.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= arr[i].length <= 5`
- `arr[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can `k` be greater than the number of distinct strings in the array?
   - Yes, in such cases, the function should return an empty string `""`.
2. Are there any constraints on the length of individual strings?
   - Yes, each string's length is between `1` and `5` inclusive.
3. Should the order of distinct strings maintain their first appearance order?
   - Yes, the distinct strings should be considered based on their first occurrence in the array.

## Strategy

1. Use a `HashMap` to count the frequency of each string in the array.
2. Iterate through the array to identify distinct strings (strings that have a frequency of `1`).
3. Collect these distinct strings while maintaining the order of their first appearance.
4. Return the `k`th distinct string if it exists; otherwise, return an empty string.

## Time Complexity

1. **Building the frequency map**: O(n), where n is the length of the array.
2. **Collecting distinct strings**: O(n).
3. Overall: O(n) time complexity since both major operations are O(n).

## Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class KthDistinctString {
    public static String kthDistinct(String[] arr, int k) {
        HashMap<String, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Step 1: Count the frequency of each string
        for (String str : arr) {
            frequencyMap.put(str, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(str, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        // Step 2: Collect distinct strings
        for (String str : arr) {
            if (frequencyMap.get(str) == 1) {
                k--;
                if (k == 0) {
                    return str;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // If fewer than k distinct strings exist
        return "";
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example test cases
        String[] arr1 = {"d","b","c","b","c","a"};
        int k1 = 2;
        System.out.println(kthDistinct(arr1, k1));  // Output: "a"

        String[] arr2 = {"aaa","aa","a"};
        int k2 = 1;
        System.out.println(kthDistinct(arr2, k2));  // Output: "aaa"
        
        String[] arr3 = {"d","b","b","a"};
        int k3 = 2;
        System.out.println(kthDistinct(arr3, k3));  // Output: ""
    }
}
```

This code will determine the `k`th distinct string in the given array or return an empty string if the number of distinct strings is less than `k`.
