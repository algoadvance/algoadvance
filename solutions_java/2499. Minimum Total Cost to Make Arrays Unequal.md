[Leetcode 2499. Minimum Total Cost to Make Arrays Unequal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2499)
### Problem Statement

You're given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of the same length `n`, and you need to make `nums1` unequal to `nums2` by modifying the elements of `nums1`. A modification consists of incrementing or decrementing an element of `nums1` by 1. The goal is to find the minimum total cost to make `nums1` unequal to `nums2`. Each increment or decrement has a cost of 1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the maximum and minimum lengths `n` for the arrays?
   - What are the range of values for the elements in `nums1` and `nums2`?
   
2. **Are all elements in `nums1` initially equal to the corresponding elements in `nums2`?**
   - This isn't explicitly stated, but knowing the initial condition helps.

3. **Is the goal to make all elements unequal or just any one element?**
   - It seems like making at least one element unequal is the objective.

### Assumptions
- Arrays `nums1` and `nums2` are of the same length.
- The elements can be positive or negative integers or zero.

### Strategy

1. Traverse both arrays in parallel.
2. Whenever you find `nums1[i]` equal to `nums2[i]`, choose the minimum cost operation (increment or decrement).
3. Accumulate the total cost for making them unequal.

### Time Complexity
The solution will traverse the arrays once, hence it will have a time complexity of \(O(n)\).

### Code Implementation

```java
public class MinimumTotalCost {

    public static int minCostToMakeArraysUnequal(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int n = nums1.length;
        int totalCost = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // If elements are equal, find a way to make them unequal with the minimum cost
            if (nums1[i] == nums2[i]) {
                totalCost += 1;  // Increment or decrement by 1 to make them unequal
            }
        }
        
        return totalCost;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums1 = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        int[] nums2 = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        System.out.println(minCostToMakeArraysUnequal(nums1, nums2));  // Output: 4
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. Initialize `totalCost` to 0.
2. Loop through each element of the arrays.
3. If `nums1[i]` is equal to `nums2[i]`, increment the total cost by 1.
4. Return the accumulated `totalCost` after the loop.

This approach ensures the minimum cost by performing the least expensive operation (increase or decrease by 1) whenever necessary.
