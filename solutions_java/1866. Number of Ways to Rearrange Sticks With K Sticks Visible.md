[Leetcode 1866. Number of Ways to Rearrange Sticks With K Sticks Visible](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1866)
### Problem Statement

Given `n` sticks, we need to rearrange them such that exactly `k` sticks are visible. The visibility of a stick means that it is not blocked by any taller sticks positioned before it. Return the number of such distinct rearrangements. As the answer can be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What constitutes a visible stick?**
   - A stick is visible if there are no taller sticks before it in the arrangement.
   
2. **Do we have any constraints on `n` and `k`?**
   - Typically, the constraints are `1 <= k <= n <= 1000`.

3. **If k > n, what should the output be?**
   - If `k` is greater than `n`, it's impossible to have `k` sticks visible, so the result should be `0`.

4. **Are there any particular edge cases to consider?**
   - Ensure to consider scenarios where `k == 1` and `k == n` which represent the simplest and fully visible scenarios.

### Strategy

We will use **dynamic programming** to solve this problem. Let's define a DP table `dp[i][j]` where `i` represents the number of sticks and `j` represents the number of visible sticks.

#### Transition Relationship:
1. If the `i-th` stick is placed in a position such that it becomes visible, then the previous `i-1` sticks must have `j-1` sticks visible.
2. If the `i-th` stick is not visible, then we are positioning it among the first `i-1` positions, which must already have `j` visible sticks.

The transition will be:
\[ \text{dp}[i][j] = (\text{dp}[i-1][j-1] + (i-1) * \text{dp}[i-1][j]) \% MOD \]
Where `MOD = 10^9 + 7`.

##### Base Cases:
- `dp[i][0] = 0` for all `i > 0` because you can't have more than 0 sticks visible with more than 0 sticks.
- `dp[0][0] = 1` which is the base case with no sticks and no visibility.

### Code

```java
public class RearrangeSticks {
    private static final int MOD = 1000000007;

    public int rearrangeSticks(int n, int k) {
        // Edge case
        if (k > n) {
            return 0;
        }

        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][k + 1];

        // Initialize base cases
        dp[0][0] = 1;

        // Fill the dp table
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i - 1][j - 1] + (long)(i - 1) * dp[i - 1][j] % MOD) % MOD;
            }
        }

        return dp[n][k];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RearrangeSticks solution = new RearrangeSticks();
        System.out.println(solution.rearrangeSticks(3, 2));
        System.out.println(solution.rearrangeSticks(4, 2));
        System.out.println(solution.rearrangeSticks(5, 3));
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n \times k)\) since we are filling up an `n x k` DP table. The space complexity is also \(O(n \times k)\) due to the storage of the DP table.
