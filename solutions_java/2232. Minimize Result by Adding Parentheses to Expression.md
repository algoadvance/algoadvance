[Leetcode 2232. Minimize Result by Adding Parentheses to Expression](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2232)
### Problem Statement

The problem requires us to minimize the result of an expression given in the format "num1+num2" by adding parentheses. The expression consists of two non-negative integers with no leading zeros.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can `num1` and `num2` have lengths of 0 or 1?
   - No, both `num1` and `num2` will be non-empty strings.
2. Are there any constraints on the values of `num1` and `num2`?
   - They are non-negative integers without leading zeros.
3. Should we consider negative results?
   - No, the problem statement implies that we expect positive results from the addition of num1 and num2.

### Strategy

1. **Iteration through all possible positions for parentheses**:
   - For a given expression "num1+num2", place parentheses in every possible way to minimize the result.
   - Iterate through every split of the "num1" and "num2" into two parts: `leftNum1` and `rightNum1` for `num1`, and `leftNum2` and `rightNum2` for `num2`.
   - By placing parentheses in the form `(leftNum1(rightNum1+leftNum2)rightNum2)`, compute the result and track the minimum result and its corresponding expression.

2. **Evaluate the expressions**:
   - Parse the string into integer values and compute the product of the possible expressions.
   - Keep track of the expression and its value yielding the minimum result.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of the solution is O(n^2) where n is the length of the input string without the '+' character since we are iterating through all possible positions to place the parentheses.
  
### Code

```java
public class MinimizeResult {
    public static String minimizeResult(String expression) {
        String[] parts = expression.split("\\+");
        String num1 = parts[0];
        String num2 = parts[1];

        int minResult = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        String minExpression = "";

        for (int i = 0; i < num1.length(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < num2.length(); j++) {
                String leftNum1 = num1.substring(0, i);
                String rightNum1 = num1.substring(i);
                String leftNum2 = num2.substring(0, j + 1);
                String rightNum2 = num2.substring(j + 1);

                int part1 = (leftNum1.isEmpty()) ? 1 : Integer.parseInt(leftNum1);
                int part2 = Integer.parseInt(rightNum1) + Integer.parseInt(leftNum2);
                int part3 = (rightNum2.isEmpty()) ? 1 : Integer.parseInt(rightNum2);

                int result = part1 * part2 * part3;
                String expressionWithParentheses = leftNum1 + "(" + rightNum1 + "+" + leftNum2 + ")" + rightNum2;

                if (result < minResult) {
                    minResult = result;
                    minExpression = expressionWithParentheses;
                }
            }
        }
        return minExpression;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String expression = "12+34";
        System.out.println(minimizeResult(expression));  // Output: "1(2+34)" or some other minimal result
    }
}
```

Feel free to run the code with different examples to ensure that it covers all edge cases and obtains the optimal result.
