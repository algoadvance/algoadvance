[Leetcode 1499. Max Value of Equation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1499)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `points` containing `points[i] = [xi, yi]` representing coordinates of points on a 2D plane, and an integer `k`, you need to find the maximum value of the equation:

\[ yi + yj + |xi - xj| \]

where \(|xi - xj| <= k\) and \(i < j\).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are the `x` values guaranteed to be sorted in some way?
   **A:** Yes, the `x` values are sorted in ascending order.
   
2. **Q:** If \(i\) must be less than \(j\), does that mean we only consider pairs where the first point comes before the second in the array?
   **A:** Yes, we only consider pairs where the first point comes before the second point in the array.

3. **Q:** What are the constraints on the values of the coordinates and `k`?
   **A:** The constraints typically are:
   - \(2 <= \text{points.length} <= 10^5\)
   - \(-10^8 <= xi, yi <= 10^8\)
   - \(0 <= k <= 2 \times 10^8\)

### Strategy

Observing the equation:

\[ yi + yj + |xi - xj| \]

Since \(i < j\) and the `x` values are sorted in ascending order, \(|xi - xj| = xj - xi\). The equation simplifies to:

\[ yi + yj + (xj - xi) = (yi - xi) + (yj + xj) \]

Given we need to maximize this, we treat `(yj + xj)` as a constant when iterating through potential values, and maximize `(yi - xi)` from previous points where \((xj - xi) <= k\).

#### Approach

1. Use a `PriorityQueue` (or max-heap) to maintain potential candidates for `yi - xi`.
2. Iterate through the points and for each new point, calculate `yj + xj`.
3. Use the heap to find the max `(yi - xi)` where `xj - xi <= k`, to form the current best equation value.
4. Add the current pair `(yi - xi, xi)` to the heap.
5. Ensure at each step that points in the heap are within the distance `k`.

### Code

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;
import java.util.Comparator;

public class Solution {
    public int findMaxValueOfEquation(int[][] points, int k) {
        PriorityQueue<int[]> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(new Comparator<int[]>() {
            public int compare(int[] a, int[] b) {
                return b[0] - a[0]; // max-heap based on value yi - xi
            }
        });
        
        int maxValue = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        
        for (int[] point : points) {
            int xj = point[0], yj = point[1];
            
            while (!maxHeap.isEmpty() && xj - maxHeap.peek()[1] > k) {
                maxHeap.poll();
            }
            
            if (!maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
                maxValue = Math.max(maxValue, maxHeap.peek()[0] + yj + xj);
            }
            
            maxHeap.offer(new int[] { yj - xj, xj });
        }
        
        return maxValue;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Insertion and Deletion from Heap:** \(O(\log N)\) for each point.
- **Total Complexity:** \(O(N \log N)\) where \(N\) is the number of points.

This ensures efficient handling of the constraints and provides the necessary maximum value for the equation given.
