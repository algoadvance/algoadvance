[Leetcode 1190. Reverse Substrings Between Each Pair of Parentheses](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1190)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s` that consists of lower case English letters and parentheses. You need to reverse the strings in each pair of matching parentheses, starting from the innermost one. Your result should not contain any parentheses.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:** What is the length range of the string `s`? (For assessing the efficiency of the solution)
2. **Parentheses Validity:** Can we assume that the parentheses in the input string `s` are always balanced and properly nested?
3. **Edge Cases:** Are there any edge cases we should be aware of, such as an empty string or a string without any parentheses?

### Strategy
To solve this problem:
1. Use a stack to keep track of the indices of the opening parentheses '(' in the string.
2. Iterate through the string character by character.
3. If we encounter an opening parenthesis '(', push its index onto the stack.
4. If we encounter a closing parenthesis ')', pop the index of the most recent opening parenthesis from the stack. Then, reverse the substring between this pair of parentheses in the string.
5. Continue with this process until all pairs of parentheses are processed.
6. Construct the final result by iterating through the modified string and skipping any parentheses.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public String reverseParentheses(String s) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        char[] chars = s.toCharArray();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {
            if (chars[i] == '(') {
                stack.push(i);
            } else if (chars[i] == ')') {
                int openIdx = stack.pop();
                reverse(chars, openIdx + 1, i - 1);
            }
        }
        
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        for (char c : chars) {
            if (c != '(' && c != ')') {
                result.append(c);
            }
        }
        
        return result.toString();
    }
    
    private void reverse(char[] chars, int left, int right) {
        while (left < right) {
            char temp = chars[left];
            chars[left] = chars[right];
            chars[right] = temp;
            left++;
            right--;
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity of the solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. This is because:
  1. Each character is processed at most twice (once for scanning and once for reversing).
  2. The stack operations (push and pop) are O(1) operations.
  
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is **O(n)** because we store indices in the stack, which in the worst case requires space proportional to the length of the string. Additionally, we use a character array which also takes O(n) space.
