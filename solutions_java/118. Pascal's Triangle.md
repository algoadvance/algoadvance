[Leetcode 118. Pascal's Triangle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l118)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer `numRows`, generate the first `numRows` of Pascal's triangle. 

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it. 

Here is an example of the first 5 rows of Pascalâ€™s triangle:

```
[
     [1],
    [1,1],
   [1,2,1],
  [1,3,3,1],
 [1,4,6,4,1]
]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. What should be returned if `numRows` is zero? 
   - An empty list `[]`.
2. Is there a maximum constraint for `numRows`?
   - Typically, constraints will be reasonable for performance, but implementing in a scalable way for competitive programming is advantageous.
3. Are negative values for `numRows` considered valid input?
   - No. We can assume `numRows` will always be a non-negative integer.

### Strategy
1. Initialize a list `result` to store the rows of Pascal's triangle.
2. Append the first row `[1]` and iterate from the second row up to `numRows`.
3. For each row, create a new list that starts with `1`.
4. Use the previous row to calculate the intermediate values and append them to the current row.
5. End the row with `1` and append it to the `result`.
6. Return the `result` list.

### Time Complexity
- Constructing each row involves iterating over the elements of the previous row, leading to a time complexity for the n-th row as `O(n)`.
- Summing the time complexities for all rows results in an overall time complexity of `O(numRows^2)`.

### Code
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> generate(int numRows) {
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        if (numRows == 0) {
            return result;
        }

        // First base row
        List<Integer> row = new ArrayList<>();
        row.add(1);
        result.add(new ArrayList<>(row));

        for (int i = 1; i < numRows; i++) {
            List<Integer> prevRow = result.get(result.size() - 1);
            row = new ArrayList<>();
            row.add(1); // first element

            // middle elements
            for (int j = 1; j < prevRow.size(); j++) {
                row.add(prevRow.get(j - 1) + prevRow.get(j));
            }

            row.add(1); // last element
            result.add(row);
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.generate(5));
    }
}
```

### Explanation
- **Line by Line**:
  - `result` is the final list of lists that will hold all the rows.
  - If `numRows` is 0, we return an empty list.
  - Start with the first row `[1]`.
  - For each row from 2 to `numRows`:
    - Retrieve the last row from `result`.
    - Start each new row with `[1]`.
    - Calculate the intermediate values by summing adjacent values from the previous row.
    - End each row with `[1]`.
    - Add the constructed row to `result`.
  - Return the resulting triangle.

This code ensures that the Pascal's Triangle is built row by row with each element dependent on the values directly above it, conforming to the defined properties.
