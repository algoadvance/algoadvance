[Leetcode 1877. Minimize Maximum Pair Sum in Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1877)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` of even length `n`. You need to split the array into `n / 2` pairs such that:

1. Each element of the array belongs to exactly one pair.
2. The maximum pair sum, i.e., the maximum of the sums of the pairs, is minimized.

Return the minimized maximum pair sum after optimally pairing up the elements.

### Example
``` 
Input: nums = [3,5,2,3]
Output: 7
```
Explanation:
- The array can be split into pairs (3, 3) and (5, 2).
- The pair sums are 6 and 7.
- The maximum pair sum is 7.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints**: What is the range of the elements in `nums`?
   - You can assume `2 <= n <= 10^5` and `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`.
2. **Input properties**: Will the input array always have an even number of elements?
   - Yes, it is given that `n` is even.

### Strategy

To minimize the maximum pair sum, consider the following strategy:
1. Sort the array.
2. Pair the smallest element with the largest element, the second smallest with the second largest, and so on.
3. This pairing minimizes the potential increase of the pair sums, leading to a minimized maximum pair sum.

### Code

Here's how you can implement this strategy in Java:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MinimizeMaxPairSum {
    public int minPairSum(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int maxSum = 0;
        int n = nums.length;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
            int pairSum = nums[i] + nums[n - 1 - i];
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, pairSum);
        }
        
        return maxSum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimizeMaxPairSum instance = new MinimizeMaxPairSum();
        int[] nums = {3, 5, 2, 3};
        System.out.println(instance.minPairSum(nums)); // Output should be 7
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting**: The time complexity for sorting the array is `O(n log n)`.
2. **Pairing and Finding Maximum**: After sorting, finding the maximum pair sum takes linear time, i.e., `O(n)`.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step. This approach is efficient and feasible given the constraint `2 <= n <= 10^5`.
