[Leetcode 1209. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1209)
### Problem Statement
The problem "1209. Remove All Adjacent Duplicates in String II" requires us to remove all adjacent duplicates in string `s` repeatedly until no more adjacent duplicates of length `k` can be removed.

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, the goal is to find the final string after removing all such duplicates.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: s = "deeedbbcccbdaa", k = 3
Output: "aa"
Explanation: 
First delete "eee" and "ccc", get "ddbbbdaa"
Then delete "bbb", get "dddaa"
Finally delete "ddd", get "aa"
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Character Case Sensitivity:** Is the string case-sensitive?
    - Yes, the string is case-sensitive.

2. **Constraints:**
    - The length of `s` will be in the range [1, 10^5].
    - `k` will be in the range [2, 10^4].
    - The string will contain only lowercase English letters.

### Strategy
We will use a stack to help us efficiently remove the adjacent duplicates:

1. **Using a Stack:**
    - **Character Stack:** to keep track of characters in the input string.
    - **Count Stack:** to keep track of the number of consecutive occurrences of each character.

2. **Algorithm:**
    - Traverse the string character by character.
    - Use the stack to push a tuple of (character, frequency).
    - If the top of the stack has a character equal to the current character, increment the frequency.
    - If at any point the frequency reaches `k`, pop the top element from the stack.
    - At the end, build the result string from the characters remaining in the stack.

By following this approach, we ensure that each character is processed only once, making the algorithm efficient.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`. Each character is processed in constant time.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), in the worst case, we may store all characters and counts on the stack.

### Code
Here is a Java code implementation of the above strategy:

```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class Solution {
    public String removeDuplicates(String s, int k) {
        // Stack to hold characters and their counts
        Stack<Pair> stack = new Stack<>();
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek().character == c) {
                stack.peek().count += 1;
            } else {
                stack.push(new Pair(c, 1));
            }
            
            if (stack.peek().count == k) {
                stack.pop();
            }
        }
        
        // Build the final string from the stack
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            Pair p = stack.pop();
            for (int i = 0; i < p.count; i++) {
                result.append(p.character);
            }
        }
        
        return result.reverse().toString();
    }

    // Helper class to store character and its count
    static class Pair {
        char character;
        int count;
        
        public Pair(char character, int count) {
            this.character = character;
            this.count = count;
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation
- We define a `Pair` class to bundle characters and their counts.
- Traverse each character of the string and use the stack to manage counts.
- If the count reaches `k`, we remove the element from the stack.
- Finally, construct the resultant string by popping elements from the stack and reversing it to match the correct order.
