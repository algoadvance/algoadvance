[Leetcode 1620. Coordinate With Maximum Network Quality](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1620)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of network towers, where `towers[i]` = [xi, yi, qi] denotes the ith network tower located at (xi, yi) and transmitting a quality factor of qi. You are also given an integer radius, which indicates the effective radius of each tower's signal.

The quality of a signal from a tower at (xi, yi) in a given point (x, y) is calculated using the formula: 
\[ \text{quality} = \lfloor \frac{q_i}{1 + d} \rfloor \]
where d is the distance between (xi, yi) and (x, y) in Euclidean distance.

The network quality at a coordinate (x, y) is the sum of the qualities from all towers that can reach (x, y), i.e., the towers for which d ≤ radius.

Return the coordinate that has the maximum network quality. If there are multiple coordinates, return the lexicographically smaller one.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: What are the constraints on the coordinates and quality factors?
   - The coordinates will be within the range \([0, 50]\). The quality factors and radius will both be non-negative integers.
2. **Output**: What should be returned if there are multiple coordinates with the same maximum quality?
   - We should return the smallest coordinate lexicographically, i.e., if there are ties, the coordinate with the smaller x should be preferred. If there is still a tie, the coordinate with the smaller y should be returned.

### Strategy
1. **Brute Force Search**: Since the range of coordinates is small (0 to 50), we can check every possible coordinate within this grid.
2. **Distance Calculation**: For each coordinate (x, y) within the grid, calculate the quality contributed by each tower if the tower is within the given radius.
3. **Euclidean Distance**: Calculate the Euclidean distance and use it to determine if a tower's signal reaches (x, y).
4. **Quality Aggregation**: Aggregate the quality from all reachable towers for each coordinate.
5. **Max Quality Determination**: Track the maximum network quality and update the result if a better quality is found or if it's lexicographically smaller when qualities are equal.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N * 51 * 51) where N is the number of towers. Since the grid is nominally 51x51, the complexity remains manageable for the given constraints.

### Code

```java
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public int[] bestCoordinate(int[][] towers, int radius) {
        int maxQuality = 0;
        int[] bestCoord = {0, 0};
        
        for (int x = 0; x <= 50; x++) {
            for (int y = 0; y <= 50; y++) {
                int currentQuality = 0;

                for (int[] tower : towers) {
                    int tx = tower[0];
                    int ty = tower[1];
                    int tq = tower[2];
                    
                    double dist = Math.sqrt((tx - x) * (tx - x) + (ty - y) * (ty - y));
                    if (dist <= radius) {
                        currentQuality += Math.floor(tq / (1 + dist));
                    }
                }
                
                if (currentQuality > maxQuality || (currentQuality == maxQuality && isLexicographicallySmall(x, y, bestCoord))) {
                    maxQuality = currentQuality;
                    bestCoord = new int[]{x, y};
                }
            }
        }
        
        return bestCoord;
    }

    private boolean isLexicographicallySmall(int x, int y, int[] bestCoord) {
        return x < bestCoord[0] || (x == bestCoord[0] && y < bestCoord[1]);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[][] towers = {{1,2,5}, {2,1,7}, {3,1,9}};
        int radius = 2;
        int[] result = sol.bestCoordinate(towers, radius);
        System.out.println(result[0] + ", " + result[1]);  // Output: [2, 1]
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Nested Loops**: The outer loops iterate over each possible coordinate within the grid (0 to 50).
2. **Inner Loop for Towers**: For each coordinate, it iterates through each tower to calculate the quality if the tower is within the effective radius.
3. **Euclidean Distance Check**: The Euclidean distance is calculated using `Math.sqrt()`. If the tower's distance is within the radius, the quality is calculated and added to the current coordinate's total quality.
4. **Quality Comparison**: The current coordinate's quality is compared with the maximum quality found so far. If it's better, or if there’s a tie but lexicographically smaller, update the best coordinates.
5. **Lexicographical Order**: Ensures that in case of ties, the smallest coordinate is chosen.

This approach ensures that the solution works efficiently within the given constraints and provides the correct answer as required by the problem statement.
