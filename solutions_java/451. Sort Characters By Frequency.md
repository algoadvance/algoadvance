[Leetcode 451. Sort Characters By Frequency](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l451)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of characters, and return the new string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input and Output:**
    - **Input:** A string `s` containing various characters.
    - **Output:** A new string sorted by the frequency of characters in descending order.

2. **Constraints:**
    - The length of `s` is at most `5 * 10^5`.
    - `s` consists of English letters and digits.

3. **Behavior with Ties:**
    - When two characters have the same frequency, their order in the result can be arbitrary.

### Strategy
1. **Frequency Calculation:**
    - We will use a HashMap to count the frequency of each character in the string.

2. **Sorting Characters by Frequency:**
    - Store characters in a list of buckets where the index represents the frequency. 
    - We can use an array of lists to efficiently categorize characters by their frequencies.

3. **Building Result String:**
    - Iterate from the highest frequency bucket down to the lowest, and build the resulting string by repeating characters according to their frequency.

### Time Complexity
- **Frequency Calculation:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the string.
- **Bucket Sort Preparation:** O(n) since adding to the bucket is proportional to the number of characters.
- **Building Result String:** O(n) as we are iterating through the buckets to build the final string.
- **Overall Time Complexity:** O(n).

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class SortCharactersByFrequency {
    public String frequencySort(String s) {
        // Step 1: Calculate frequency of each character
        Map<Character, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            frequencyMap.put(c, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        // Step 2: Create buckets for frequencies
        List<Character>[] buckets = new List[s.length() + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i <= s.length(); i++) {
            buckets[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        for (Map.Entry<Character, Integer> entry : frequencyMap.entrySet()) {
            char c = entry.getKey();
            int frequency = entry.getValue();
            buckets[frequency].add(c);
        }
        
        // Step 3: Build the result string
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        for (int i = buckets.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (char c : buckets[i]) {
                for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                    result.append(c);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result.toString();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SortCharactersByFrequency solution = new SortCharactersByFrequency();
        String s = "tree";
        String sortedString = solution.frequencySort(s);
        System.out.println(sortedString);  // Output could be "eert" or "eetr"
    }
}
```

### Explanation of Code
1. **Frequency Calculation:** We populate the `frequencyMap` with character counts.
2. **Bucket Preparation:** We create a bucket array where each index `i` contains a list of characters that appear `i` times in the original string.
3. **Result Building:** We iterate from the highest frequency bucket to the lowest, appending characters to the result based on their frequency.

In the provided code, edge cases like an empty string or a string with only one character are inherently handled, as the loops will simply not insert any characters or will just return the input character, respectively.
