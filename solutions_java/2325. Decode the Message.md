[Leetcode 2325. Decode the Message](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2325)
### Problem Statement
Leetcode problem 2325: Decode the Message

You are given a string `key` and a string `message`.

The `key` is a permutation of the lowercase English letters ('a' to 'z') which is a way to ensure that each letter appears exactly once. The `message` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and spaces.

You need to decode the `message` using the `key` such that each letter in the message is replaced by the corresponding letter in the alphabetical order (i.e., if a letter `x` maps to the `1st` letter in the `alphabet`, it maps to 'a', if it maps to the `2nd` letter in the `alphabet`, it maps to 'b', and so on).

Return the decoded message.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are there any constraints on the length of the `key` and `message`?
   - The lengths of `key` and `message` are not explicitly limited, but `key` is always 26 characters long and `message` can be of any length.
  
2. Should I take care of upper-case letters or other symbols?
   - No, the problem specifies only lowercase English letters and spaces.

### Strategy
1. Create a mapping from the permutation given in the `key` to the standard alphabetical order.
2. Iterate through the `message`, use the mapping to construct the decoded message.
3. For spaces in the `message`, append them directly to the decoded output.

### Code
Here's the Java code to solve the problem:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Decoder {
    public String decodeMessage(String key, String message) {
        // Step 1: Create the mapping from `key` to the standard alphabet
        Map<Character, Character> keyMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        char currentAlphabetChar = 'a';
        for (char ch : key.toCharArray()) {
            if (ch != ' ' && !keyMap.containsKey(ch)) {
                keyMap.put(ch, currentAlphabetChar++);
            }
        }
        
        // Step 2: Use the mapping to decode the message
        StringBuilder decodedMessage = new StringBuilder();
        for (char ch : message.toCharArray()) {
            if (ch != ' ') {
                decodedMessage.append(keyMap.get(ch));
            } else {
                decodedMessage.append(' ');
            }
        }
        
        return decodedMessage.toString();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Decoder decoder = new Decoder();
        String key = "the quick brown fox jumps over lazy dog";
        String message = "vkbs bs t suepuv";
        System.out.println(decoder.decodeMessage(key, message));  // Expected Output: "this is a secret"
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is `O(N)`, where `N` is the length of `message` because:
1. Building the mapping from `key` requires a single pass through the `key`, which takes `O(26)` or `O(1)`.
2. Decoding the `message` requires a single pass through `message`, thus `O(N)`.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is `O(1)` for the mapping table since it only stores mappings for a fixed set of 26 letters, resulting in a constant space requirement regardless of input size. The output space is `O(N)` for storing the decoded message.
