[Leetcode 623. Add One Row to Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l623)
### Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree and two integers `val` and `depth`, add a row of nodes with value `val` at the given depth `depth`. The root node is considered to have depth `1`.

The adding rule is:
- Given the depth `depth`, for each not null tree node `N` at the depth `depth - 1`, create two tree nodes with value `val` as `N`'s left subtree root and `N`'s right subtree root.
- `N`'s original left subtree should be the left subtree of the new left subtree root.
- `N`'s original right subtree should be the right subtree of the new right subtree root.

Return the modified tree's root.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: root = [4,2,6,3,1,5], val = 1, depth = 2
Output: [4,1,1,2,null,null,6,3,1,5]

Input: root = [4,2,null,3,1], val = 1, depth = 3
Output: [4,2,null,1,1,3,null,null,1]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. What should we do if the given `depth` is 1?
   - If `depth` is 1, then we need to add the new row at the root. This means creating a new root with the given `val` and making the existing tree its left subtree.

2. What kind of input validations should we consider?
   - We assume that the input binary tree is well-formed. There are no constraints on the size of the tree or the values of the nodes.

### Strategy

1. **Depth handling**: Special case handling for `depth == 1` where we need to replace the root.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** or **Depth-First Search (DFS)** at each `(depth-1)` to insert the new nodes.

### Code

Here's the Java code to implement the solution:

```java
public class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode() {}
    TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
    TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

public class Solution {
    public TreeNode addOneRow(TreeNode root, int val, int depth) {
        if (depth == 1) {
            return new TreeNode(val, root, null);
        }
        insert(root, val, depth, 1);
        return root;
    }

    private void insert(TreeNode node, int val, int depth, int currentDepth) {
        if (node == null) {
            return;
        }
        if (currentDepth == depth - 1) {
            TreeNode tempLeft = node.left;
            TreeNode tempRight = node.right;
            node.left = new TreeNode(val, tempLeft, null);
            node.right = new TreeNode(val, null, tempRight);
        } else {
            insert(node.left, val, depth, currentDepth + 1);
            insert(node.right, val, depth, currentDepth + 1);
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we need to potentially visit each node once to insert the new row at the correct depth.

### Summary

1. If `depth == 1`, make a new root.
2. Use DFS or BFS to find the correct nodes at `depth - 1`.
3. Add the new nodes with value `val`.
4. Ensure the original subtrees are correctly assigned.
