[Leetcode 335. Self Crossing](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l335)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `distance` representing the distance that a bug travels along the x-y plane. The bug starts moving north along the y-axis, and then follows a specific pattern: it turns 90 degrees counterclockwise and moves the next distance, repeating this process.

Determine whether the bug's path crosses itself at any point.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the range of the array `distance` length?
   - Are there negative distances in the array?

2. **Output**:
   - Should we return a boolean indicating if the path crosses itself?

3. **Path Definition**:
   - Does the bug's initial direction (north) start from the origin point (0, 0)?

Assumption: 
- Array length is significant enough to require an optimal solution.
- All distances are positive integers.

### Strategy

To determine if the path crosses itself, we can simulate the movements of the bug. There are specific conditions under which crossing might occur:

1. **Fourth Move Crossing First Move**: After four moves (North, West, South, East), if the current position crosses the initial path, there is a crossing.
2. **Fifth Move Crossing First Move**: In the fifth move, crossing occurs similarly but the conditions for bypassing are more relaxed.
3. **Sixth Move Crossing First or Second Move**: The condition becomes a little more complex because it can cross more than one of the prior movements.

We can break down the cross-checks into these conditions. Let's move forward with implementing this.

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean isSelfCrossing(int[] distance) {
        int n = distance.length;
        if (n < 4) return false;
        
        for (int i = 3; i < n; i++) {
            // 4th line crosses the 1st line.
            if (distance[i] >= distance[i-2] && distance[i-1] <= distance[i-3]) {
                return true;
            }
            // 5th line crosses the 1st line.
            if (i >= 4 && distance[i-1] == distance[i-3] && distance[i] + distance[i-4] >= distance[i-2]) {
                return true;
            }
            // 6th line crosses the 1st or 2nd line.
            if (i >= 5 && distance[i-2] >= distance[i-4] 
                && distance[i] + distance[i-4] >= distance[i-2] 
                && distance[i-1] <= distance[i-3]
                && distance[i-1] + distance[i-5] >= distance[i-3]) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        
        // Test cases
        int[] distance1 = {2, 1, 1, 2};
        System.out.println(sol.isSelfCrossing(distance1)); // Expected output: true

        int[] distance2 = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        System.out.println(sol.isSelfCrossing(distance2)); // Expected output: false

        int[] distance3 = {1, 1, 1, 1};
        System.out.println(sol.isSelfCrossing(distance3)); // Expected output: true
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the `distance` array. We only make a single pass through the array to determine if any of the conditions for crossing are met.

This solution ensures we cover all crossing scenarios efficiently while maintaining readability and clarity in the code.
