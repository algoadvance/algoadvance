[Leetcode 1353. Maximum Number of Events That Can Be Attended](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1353)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of `events` where `events[i] = [startDayi, endDayi]`. Every event `i` starts at `startDayi` and ends at `endDayi`.

You can attend an event `i` at any day `d` where `startDayi <= d <= endDayi`, but you can only attend one event per day.

Return the **maximum number of events** you can attend.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for `startDay` and `endDay`?**
   - The values for `startDay` and `endDay` both lie between `1` and `10^5`.

2. **How many events can there be?**
   - The length of the `events` array can be up to `10^5`.

3. **Can events overlap in their days?**
   - Yes, events can overlap.

4. **What should we consider if two events start and end on the same day?**
   - We can only choose to attend one of these events.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Events:**
   - First, sort the events by their start day. If two events have the same start day, then sort them by their end day.

2. **Use a Min-Heap:**
   - Use a min-heap to track the end days of all active events that have started but not yet ended by the current day.
   - Each day, we will attend the event that ends the earliest (this helps to keep the most options open for future events).

3. **Iterate Over the Days:**
   - Iterate from the first day any event starts to the last potential day of any event.
   - Each day, populate the min-heap with events that start on that day.
   - Remove events from the min-heap that ended before the current day.
   - Attend the event that ends the earliest (i.e., pop the top of the min-heap).

4. **Count and Return:**
   - Count the number of events attended and return it.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int maxEvents(int[][] events) {
        // Sort events by their start days. If two events have the same start day, sort by end day.
        Arrays.sort(events, (a, b) -> a[0] == b[0] ? Integer.compare(a[1], b[1]) : Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));
        
        // Min-heap to keep track of active events by their end days.
        PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
        
        int i = 0, n = events.length, count = 0;
        for (int day = 1; day <= 100000; day++) {
            // Add all new events that start on this day to the heap
            while (i < n && events[i][0] == day) {
                minHeap.offer(events[i][1]);
                i++;
            }
            // Remove all events whose end day is before the current day
            while (!minHeap.isEmpty() && minHeap.peek() < day) {
                minHeap.poll();
            }
            // Attend the event that ends the earliest (if any)
            if (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
                minHeap.poll();
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[][] events = // use example from above
        System.out.println(sol.maxEvents(events)); // Output: 4
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** `O(n log n)` for sorting the events array.
- **Heap Operations:** 
  - Each insertion and deletion operation in the heap takes `O(log k)` time where `k` is the number of active events in the heap.
  - In the worst case, inserting and removing elements from the heap takes `O(n log n)` time.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the solution is `O(n log n)`.
