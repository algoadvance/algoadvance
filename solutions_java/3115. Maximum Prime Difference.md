[Leetcode 3115. Maximum Prime Difference](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3115)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers.

A prime number is a number greater than 1 with no positive divisors other than 1 and itself. You should find the two prime numbers in the array that result in the maximum absolute difference. If no such pair exists, return -1.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: [2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15]
Output: 11 (from primes 2 and 13, difference is 11)
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints:** How large can the array be, and what ranges of values can elements in the array take?
   - *Answer:* The array can contain up to \(10^5\) elements. Each element can take any integer value.
   
2. **Output requirements:** What should be the output if there are fewer than two prime numbers in the array?
   - *Answer:* Return -1 if there are fewer than two prime numbers in the array.
   
3. **Prime checking:** Are negative numbers and 0 part of the array, and should we consider them for prime checking?
   - *Answer:* Negative numbers, 0, and 1 are not prime and should not be considered.

## Strategy

1. **Prime Checking:** Implement a helper function to check if a number is prime.
2. **Filter Primes:** Iterate through the array, identify primes, and store them in a list.
3. **Calculate Maximum Difference:** If there are at least two primes, compute the maximum absolute difference between the smallest and largest prime in the list. Otherwise, return -1.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MaxPrimeDifference {

    // Helper function to determine if a number is prime
    private static boolean isPrime(int number) {
        if (number <= 1) return false; // 0, 1, and negative numbers are not prime
        if (number == 2) return true; // 2 is the only even prime number
        if (number % 2 == 0) return false; // Other even numbers are not prime
        for (int i = 3; i <= Math.sqrt(number); i += 2) {
            if (number % i == 0) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }

    public static int maximumPrimeDifference(int[] nums) {
        // List to store the prime numbers found in the array
        List<Integer> primes = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Filter out primes
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (isPrime(num)) {
                primes.add(num);
            }
        }

        // If we have fewer than 2 primes, return -1
        if (primes.size() < 2) return -1;
        
        // Compute the maximum absolute difference between the smallest and largest prime
        int minPrime = Collections.min(primes);
        int maxPrime = Collections.max(primes);
        
        return maxPrime - minPrime;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {2, 4, 6, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15};
        System.out.println(maximumPrimeDifference(nums)); // Output: 11
        
        int[] nums2 = {4, 6, 8, 10, 12};
        System.out.println(maximumPrimeDifference(nums2)); // Output: -1
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Prime Checking:** Checking if a single number `n` is prime takes \(O(\sqrt{n})\).
2. **Filtering Primes:** Filtering primes in the array of size `n` takes \(O(n \cdot \sqrt{m})\), where `m` is the maximum value in the array.
3. **Finding Min and Max Value:** Finding the minimum and maximum in a list of primes (assuming `p` primes) takes \(O(p)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is:
\[O(n \cdot \sqrt{m})\]
