[Leetcode 2617. Minimum Number of Visited Cells in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2617)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` grid consisting of non-negative integers. Initially, you are in the top-left cell `(0, 0)`, and you need to reach the bottom-right cell `(m-1, n-1)`.

From a cell `(i, j)`, you can move to any cell `(i, j+k)` if `j+k < n` or any cell `(i+k, j)` if `i+k < m`, where `k` is a positive integer such that `(i, j+k)` or `(i+k, j)` has not been visited before.

The goal is to determine the minimum number of cells you need to visit (including the starting and ending cells) to reach the bottom-right cell.

Return the minimum number of cells you need to visit, or `-1` if you cannot reach the bottom-right cell.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can I assume that the grid dimensions `m` and `n` are always at least 1x1?**
   - Yes, you can assume `m` and `n` are at least 1.
2. **Are there any constraints on the values inside the grid?**
   - The values in the grid are non-negative integers.
3. **Is it guaranteed there is always a valid path from the top-left to the bottom-right?**
   - No, you need to determine if a path exists.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach to find the shortest path in the grid. The BFS will help us explore all possible cells we can move to in the shortest possible steps, ensuring that we find the minimal number of cells visited.

1. **Initialize** a queue to keep track of cells to be explored. Starting cell is `(0, 0)`, so initialize the queue with this cell and mark it as visited.
2. **Perform BFS**:
   - For each cell `(i, j)` in the queue, check all valid moves `(i, j+k)` and `(i+k, j)` where `k` is a positive integer.
   - Add these cells to the queue if they haven't been visited and mark them as visited.
3. **Track Depth**:
   - Count the number of levels (or the depth of BFS) to measure the number of cells visited.
4. **Check for Target**:
   - If we reach the target cell `(m-1, n-1)`, return the number of cells visited.
   - If the queue is exhausted and we haven't reached the target, return `-1`.

This algorithm uses BFS to ensure we find the shortest path in terms of cells visited.

## Code

Here is the Java implementation:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MinCellsVisitedGrid {
    public int minNumberOfVisitedCells(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        
        if (m == 1 && n == 1) return 1;
        
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[m][n];
        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(new int[]{0, 0, 1}); // {row, col, depth}
        visited[0][0] = true;
        
        int[] dr = {0, 1}; // right, down
        int[] dc = {1, 0}; // right, down
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] cell = queue.poll();
            int row = cell[0];
            int col = cell[1];
            int depth = cell[2];
            
            for (int i = 0; i < 2; i++) {
                for (int k = 1; ; k++) {
                    int newRow = row + dr[i] * k;
                    int newCol = col + dc[i] * k;
                    
                    if (newRow < m && newCol < n && !visited[newRow][newCol]) {
                        if (newRow == m - 1 && newCol == n - 1) {
                            return depth + 1;
                        }
                        queue.add(new int[]{newRow, newCol, depth + 1});
                        visited[newRow][newCol] = true;
                    } else {
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return -1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinCellsVisitedGrid solver = new MinCellsVisitedGrid();
        int[][] grid = {{0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}, {0, 0, 0}};
        System.out.println(solver.minNumberOfVisitedCells(grid)); // Expected: 3
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(m \times n \times \max(m, n))\), where \(m\) is the number of rows and \(n\) is the number of columns. This is because in the worst case, for each cell, we may need to check a linear number of moves in both right and down directions.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(m \times n)\), due to the visited matrix and the queue storage.
