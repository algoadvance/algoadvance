[Leetcode 1040. Moving Stones Until Consecutive II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1040)
### Problem Statement
Given three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, representing the positions of three stones on a number line, you need to determine the minimum and maximum number of moves to make these stones consecutive. In one move, you can move any stone to an unoccupied position.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of Values**: What are the constraints for the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`?
   - The problem can usually assume that these are integer values within a certain limit, e.g., `1 <= a, b, c <= 10^9`.

2. **Distinct Values**: Are `a`, `b`, and `c` guaranteed to be distinct?
   - Typically yes, since the stones have distinct positions.

3. **Unoccupied Positions**: Can a stone be moved outside the initial range (like to a negative number or a very high positive number)?
   - Typically, yes, since the number line is effectively unbounded.

### Strategy
1. **Sort the Positions**: First, sort the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` to make calculations easier. Letâ€™s say after sorting, we have positions `x, y, z` where `x < y < z`.

2. **Calculate Gaps**: Compute the gaps between the stones: `gap1 = y - x - 1` and `gap2 = z - y - 1`. These gaps represent the number of unoccupied positions between the stones.

3. **Minimum Moves**:
    - If the stones are already consecutive, no move is needed.
    - If either gap is 1 (i.e., `gap1 == 1` or `gap2 == 1`), it takes only one move to make the stones consecutive (`x, y, z` -> `x, x+1, u`).
    - In other cases, at most two moves are necessary because you can always reduce any distance down to a sequence of two steps.

4. **Maximum Moves**:
    - To maximize the number of moves, move the stones one step at a time until they become consecutive. The total number of moves required will be the sum of the gaps: `gap1 + gap2`.

### Code
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MovingStonesUntilConsecutiveII {
    public int[] numMovesStonesII(int a, int b, int c) {
        // Sort the positions
        int[] positions = {a, b, c};
        Arrays.sort(positions);
        int x = positions[0], y = positions[1], z = positions[2];
        
        int gap1 = y - x - 1;
        int gap2 = z - y - 1;
        
        // Calculate minimum moves
        int minMoves;
        if (gap1 == 0 && gap2 == 0) {
            minMoves = 0; // Already consecutive
        } else if (gap1 <= 1 || gap2 <= 1) {
            minMoves = 1; // One of the gaps is 1 or less
        } else {
            minMoves = 2;
        }
        
        // Calculate maximum moves
        int maxMoves = gap1 + gap2;
        
        return new int[]{minMoves, maxMoves};
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MovingStonesUntilConsecutiveII obj = new MovingStonesUntilConsecutiveII();
        int[] result = obj.numMovesStonesII(1, 2, 5);
        System.out.println("Minimum Moves: " + result[0] + ", Maximum Moves: " + result[1]);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: The sorting operation takes \( O(1) \) since there are only three elements.
- **Calculations**: The gap calculations and subsequent logic are \( O(1) \).

Overall, the time complexity is \( O(1) \).
