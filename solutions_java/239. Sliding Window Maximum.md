[Leetcode 239. Sliding Window Maximum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l239)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums`, and there is a sliding window of size `k` which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the `k` numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return the max sliding window.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]
```
**Explanation:**
```
Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7
```
**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]
```
**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
- `1 <= k <= nums.length`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the sliding window size `k` be equal to the length of `nums`?**
   Yes, it can be equal to `nums.length`.

2. **Can the `nums` array contain negative integers?**
   Yes, it can.

3. **Is the window always moving only to the right by one position?**
   Yes, it moves to the right by one position at a time.

### Strategy

To efficiently solve this problem (within O(n) time complexity), we can use a double-ended queue (deque) which allows us to insert and remove elements from both ends. The deque will store indices of array elements and will help us keep track of the indices of the maximum elements in a sliding window.

**Approach:**

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a deque to store indices of the elements in `nums`.
   - Create a result array to store the maximums for each window.

2. **Sliding Window Logic:**
   - Iterate through each element in `nums`.
   - For the current index `i`, perform the following:
     - Remove elements from the deque which are outside the current window.
     - Remove elements from the deque which are smaller than the current element `nums[i]` from the right end since they are not useful.
     - Add the current index `i` to the deque.

3. **Result Array:**
   - For every index `i` starting from `k-1`, add `nums[deque.peekFirst()]` to the result since `deque.peekFirst()` gives the index of the maximum element in the current window.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class SlidingWindowMaximum {
    public int[] maxSlidingWindow(int[] nums, int k) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) return new int[0];
        
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] result = new int[n - k + 1];
        Deque<Integer> deque = new ArrayDeque<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // Remove elements outside the current window
            while (!deque.isEmpty() && deque.peekFirst() < i - k + 1) {
                deque.pollFirst();
            }

            // Remove smaller elements in k range as they are not useful
            while (!deque.isEmpty() && nums[deque.peekLast()] <= nums[i]) {
                deque.pollLast();
            }

            // Add current element at the end of deque
            deque.offerLast(i);

            // Starting adding maximum of current window to result array
            if (i >= k - 1) {
                result[i - k + 1] = nums[deque.peekFirst()];
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SlidingWindowMaximum solution = new SlidingWindowMaximum();
        int[] result = solution.maxSlidingWindow(new int[]{1, 3, -1, -3, 5, 3, 6, 7}, 3);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(result));  // Output: [3, 3, 5, 5, 6, 7]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time complexity:**
  The overall time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the number of elements in `nums`. Each element is processed at most twice (once added and once removed from the deque).

- **Space complexity:**
  The space complexity is O(k), since the deque will at most store `k` indices at any time.
