[Leetcode 2478. Number of Beautiful Partitions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2478)
## Problem Statement

You have been given a string `s` of length `n`, and an integer `k`. A partition of `s` into `k` substrings is called "beautiful" if:

1. Each substring is non-empty.
2. The first substring starts with a vowel.
3. Each of the next `k-1` substrings starts with a consonant.

Return the number of "beautiful" partitions of `s`.

For the purpose of this problem, we consider vowels as 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' and consonants as any other characters.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the partitions overlap?
   - No, partitions must be non-overlapping and contiguous.
   
2. Are there any constraints on the lengths of the substrings?
   - Each of the substrings must be non-empty, but otherwise no constraints on length (other than forming exactly `k` substrings).

3. Can the input string contain characters other than lowercase letters?
   - For the scope of this problem, we assume the string contains only lowercase English letters.

## Strategy

1. We need a way to determine if partitions starting at certain positions satisfy the "beautiful" condition.
2. Dynamic Programming (DP) seems suitable since overlapping subproblems exist. We'll maintain a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to partition the substring `s[i:]` into `j` "beautiful" partitions.
3. To fill this DP table, we iterate through the string, and for each position, try to split it into valid partitions and accumulate the counts.
4. We also need helper functions to check if a substring starts with a vowel or consonant.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int beautifulPartitions(String s, int k) {
        int n = s.length();
        
        // If there are fewer characters than k, no solution
        if (n < k) return 0;

        // Check if character is a vowel
        boolean[] isVowel = new boolean[26];
        isVowel['a' - 'a'] = true;
        isVowel['e' - 'e'] = true;
        isVowel['i' - 'i'] = true;
        isVowel['o' - 'o'] = true;
        isVowel['u' - 'u'] = true;
        
        // dp[i][j] represents the number of ways to partition s[i:] into j parts
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][k + 1];
        
        // Base case: there's one way to partition an empty string into 0 parts
        dp[n][0] = 1;
        
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
                // We can partition s[i:] starting at index i if it starts under appropriate conditions
                if (j == 1) {
                    // First partition must start with a vowel
                    if (isVowel[s.charAt(i) - 'a']) {
                        dp[i][j] = 1;
                    }
                } else {
                    // Ensuring valid partitioning by checking vowel/consonant conditions
                    if (i + 1 <= n && isVowel[s.charAt(i + 1 - 1) - 'a'] && !isVowel[s.charAt(i) - 'a']) {
                        dp[i][j] += dp[i + 1][j - 1];
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Return the count of ways to partition the string starting at index 0 into k parts
        return dp[0][k];
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        String s = "aeiou";
        int k = 2;
        System.out.println(sol.beautifulPartitions(s, k));  // Expected output: Number of ways to partition the string
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * k)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s` and `k` is the number of partitions. This is because we fill a table with dimensions `n * k`, and each entry involves constant time checks.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n * k)` for the DP table.
