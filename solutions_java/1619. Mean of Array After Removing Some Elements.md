[Leetcode 1619. Mean of Array After Removing Some Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1619)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `arr`. Using a sliding window, find the mean of the array after dropping the smallest 5% and the largest 5% of the elements.

**Constraints:**
1. `20 <= arr.length <= 1000`
2. `arr.length` is a multiple of 20.
3. `-10^5 <= arr[i] <= 10^5`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size**: The input array has a length that is a multiple of 20 and ranges from 20 to 1000 elements.
2. **Sorting**: To find the smallest and largest elements efficiently, sorting seems like a reasonable approach.
3. **5% Calculation**: We'll need to drop exactly 5% of the smallest and largest elements, respectively.

### Strategy
1. **Sort the Array**: First, sort the array.
2. **Calculate Indices**: Calculate the number of elements to remove, which is 5% of the array's length.
3. **Compute the Mean**: Calculate the mean of the remaining elements after removing the smallest and largest 5% of elements.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MeanAfterRemoval {
    public static double trimMean(int[] arr) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        int n = arr.length;
        int removeCount = n / 20;
        
        int sum = 0;
        for (int i = removeCount; i < n - removeCount; i++) {
            sum += arr[i];
        }
        
        double mean = (double) sum / (n - 2 * removeCount);
        return mean;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {6,2,7,5,1,2,0,9,8,12,2,3,4,5,2,7,8,3,11,6,
                     4,6,9,5,4,5,6,5,8,10,2,3,5,6,8,9,10,11,12,14};
        System.out.println("Trimmed Mean: " + trimMean(arr));
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: The sorting operation will take \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array.
- **Summation**: Summing the required elements takes \(O(n)\).
- **Overall**: The overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, so it is \(O(n \log n)\).

### Explanation
1. **Sorting the Array**: We sort the array to easily remove the smallest and largest elements.
2. **Removing 5% Elements**: By calculating the number of elements to remove (5% of array length), we straightforwardly drop those elements from both ends of the sorted array.
3. **Calculating the Mean**: Summing the remaining elements and dividing by the new length (original length minus 10%) gives the correct mean.

This approach ensures that we account for removing extreme values to find a reliable mean of the trimmed array.
