[Leetcode 876. Middle of the Linked List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l876)
### Problem Statement

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, return the middle node of the linked list. If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What is the minimum and maximum length of the linked list?
   - **A:** The linked list has at least 1 node and at most 100 nodes.

2. **Q:** Can we modify the linked list?
   - **A:** No, modifying the linked list is not allowed.

3. **Q:** What should be returned?
   - **A:** A reference to the middle node in the singly linked list.

### Strategy

We can solve this problem using a two-pointer approach:
- Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both set to the head of the linked list.
- Move `slow` by one step and `fast` by two steps in each iteration.
- When `fast` reaches the end of the list (or the node before the end in the case of even length lists), `slow` will be at the middle node.

### Code

```java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode(int x) {
        val = x;
        next = null;
    }
}

public class Solution {
    public ListNode middleNode(ListNode head) {
        ListNode slow = head;
        ListNode fast = head;
        
        while (fast != null && fast.next != null) {
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }
        
        return slow;
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: Both `slow` and `fast` pointers are initialized to point to the head of the linked list.
2. **Traversal**: 
   - The `while` loop checks whether `fast` and `fast.next` are not null.
   - Inside the loop, `slow` moves one step each time (`slow = slow.next`).
   - `fast` moves two steps each time (`fast = fast.next.next`).
3. **Termination**: When `fast` or `fast.next` is null, `slow` will be at the middle node of the linked list.
4. **Return**: The function returns the `slow` pointer, which now points to the middle node.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because in the worst case, we traverse the linked list once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) since we use only two pointers regardless of the size of the input linked list.
