[Leetcode 908. Smallest Range I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l908)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. In one operation, you can choose any element in `nums` and add or subtract `k` from it. The task is to return the smallest possible difference between the maximum and minimum elements of the array `nums` after performing this operation any number of times for each element.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What are the constraints on the values in the array and on `k`?
   - The array `nums` will have at least one element, and `k` is a non-negative integer.

2. Can the array contain negative values?
   - Yes, the elements in the array can be negative.

3. Should the result account for situations where no operations are needed?
   - Yes, the result should be the smallest possible difference, whether or not any operations are performed.

### Strategy
1. Find the initial minimum (`minNum`) and maximum (`maxNum`) of the array.
2. After applying the operations, the new possible values for any element `x` are in the range [`x - k`, `x + k`].
3. The smallest possible maximum value (`newMax`) is `maxNum - k` and the largest possible minimum value (`newMin`) is `minNum + k`.
4. Therefore, the smallest possible range will be `newMax - newMin`, but it should not be less than zero (as the range cannot be negative).

### Code
```java
public class SmallestRangeI {
    public int smallestRangeI(int[] nums, int k) {
        int minNum = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int maxNum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

        for (int num : nums) {
            minNum = Math.min(minNum, num);
            maxNum = Math.max(maxNum, num);
        }

        // Calculate the new maximum and minimum values after adding/subtracting k
        int newMin = minNum + k;
        int newMax = maxNum - k;

        // The smallest possible range, ensuring it's not negative
        return Math.max(0, newMax - newMin);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SmallestRangeI solution = new SmallestRangeI();
        int[] nums = {1, 3, 6};
        int k =
