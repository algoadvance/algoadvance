[Leetcode 2545. Sort the Students by Their Kth Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2545)
### Problem Statement
You are given a 2D integer array `score` where each `score[i]` is an array that represents the scores of the `i`th student in various subjects. Additionally, you are given an integer `k` which represents a specific subject. Your task is to sort the students based on their scores in the `k`th subject in descending order.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be the output?**
   - The output should be the sorted 2D array of students based on their `k`th score in descending order.
   
2. **Can there be duplicate scores in the `k`th subject?**
   - Yes, there can be duplicate scores.

3. **What is the range of values for `k`?**
   - The value of `k` will always be a valid index for the subjects in each student's score array.

4. **What should we do if two students have the same score in the `k`th subject?**
   - If two students have the same score, their relative order does not matter in the output.

### Strategy
1. We will use Java's built-in sorting functions to sort the array.
2. We will provide a custom comparator to the `sort` function to sort the students based on the `k`th subject.
3. Specifically, we will use `Arrays.sort()` with a lambda function to achieve the desired sorting.

### Code
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class SortStudentsByKthScore {
    public static int[][] sortStudents(int[][] score, int k) {
        // Sorting the array based on the k-th score in descending order
        Arrays.sort(score, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(b[k], a[k]));
        
        return score;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test the function with test case
        int[][] score = {
            {850, 900, 950},
            {800, 700, 650},
            {900, 850, 900},
            {950, 800, 800}
        };
        int k = 2;

        int[][] sortedScores = sortStudents(score, k);
        
        // Print the sorted scores
        for (int[] scores : sortedScores) {
            System.out.println(Arrays.toString(scores));
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting Time Complexity:** The sorting algorithm (`Arrays.sort`) used in Java typically has a time complexity of \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of students.
- **Comparator Time Complexity:** Comparing two elements takes \(O(1)\) time.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the solution is \(O(n \log n)\).

### Explanation
1. **Input:** A 2D integer array `score` and an integer `k`.
2. **Output:** A sorted 2D integer array `score` based on the `k`th subject in descending order.
3. **Method:** We use `Arrays.sort` with a custom comparator to sort the students by their `k`th score in descending order.
4. **Printing the Results:** The main method demonstrates how to use the function and prints the sorted array.
