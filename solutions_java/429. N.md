[Leetcode 429. N](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l429)
## Problem Statement
Given an n-ary tree, return the level order traversal of its nodes' values. (i.e., from left to right, level by level).

### Example:
   
   Input: [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
   
   Explanation:
   
       1
     / | \
    3  2  4
   / \
  5   6
   
   Output: [[1], [3,2,4], [5,6]]

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format:** How is the input provided? Is it a list representation or a tree structure?
    - The input is generally provided as a tree structure, where each node contains a value and a list of child nodes.
2. **Node Definition:** How is an N-ary tree node defined?
    - An `N-ary` tree node typically contains a value and a list of its child nodes.
3. **Edge Cases:** What are the edge cases we need to consider?
    - An empty tree (null root).
    - A tree with only one node.
    - Skewed tree (tree that looks more like a linked list).

## Code

### Strategy
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Use a queue to perform a level order traversal.
2. **Queue Initialization:** Start by adding the root node to the queue.
3. **Process Nodes Level by Level:**
   - While the queue is not empty, process each level by iterating over the number of nodes currently in the queue (since they all belong to the same level).
   - Collect the values of the nodes at the current level and add their children to the queue for the next level.

### Algorithm:
- Initialize a queue with the root node.
- For each level, iterate through the current level's nodes, collecting their values and adding their children to the queue.
- Append the collected values from each level to the result list.

### Implementation:
```java
import java.util.*;

// Node definition for an N-ary tree
class Node {
    public int val;
    public List<Node> children;

    public Node() {}

    public Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
    }

    public Node(int _val, List<Node> _children) {
        val = _val;
        children = _children;
    }
}

public class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> levelOrder(Node root) {
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        if (root == null) {
            return result;
        }

        Queue<Node> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(root);

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int size = queue.size();
            List<Integer> level = new ArrayList<>();
            
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                Node current = queue.poll();
                level.add(current.val);
                for (Node child : current.children) {
                    queue.offer(child);
                }
            }

            result.add(level);
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage:
        Node node5 = new Node(5, new ArrayList<>());
        Node node6 = new Node(6, new ArrayList<>());
        
        List<Node> children3 = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(node5, node6));
        Node node3 = new Node(3, children3);

        Node node2 = new Node(2, new ArrayList<>());
        Node node4 = new Node(4, new ArrayList<>());
        
        List<Node> children1 = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList(node3, node2, node4));
        Node root = new Node(1, children1);

        Solution solution = new Solution();
        List<List<Integer>> result = solution.levelOrder(root);
        System.out.println(result);  // Output: [[1], [3, 2, 4], [5, 6]]
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(N)**, where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once during the BFS traversal.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity is **O(N)** for the queue used in the BFS traversal, where N is the number of nodes. This is because, in the worst case, the queue will hold all the nodes at the current level before advancing to the next level.
