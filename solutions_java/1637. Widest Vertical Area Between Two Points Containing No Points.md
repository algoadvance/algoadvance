[Leetcode 1637. Widest Vertical Area Between Two Points Containing No Points](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1637)
### Problem Statement

Given `n` points on a 2D plane, where `points[i] = [xi, yi]`, return the **widest vertical area** between two points such that no points are inside the area. A vertical area is defined as an area of width `w` where no points lie inside the area. Formally, a vertical area is defined by two parallel lines `x = a` and `x = b` where there are no points with `x-coordinate` in the range `(a, b)`, and `a < b`. 

### Clarifying Questions

Before diving into the solution, let's clarify the problem requirements:

1. **Are there any constraints on the values of `xi` and `yi`?**
   - The coordinates are integers, and there might be constraints like `-10^9 <= xi, yi <= 10^9`.

2. **Can there be duplicate points?**
   - No, each point `[xi, yi]` is unique as implied by the problem statement.

3. **What should be returned if only one point is given?**
   - Since there's no area to measure with a single point, the answer should be `0`.

### Strategy

To find the widest vertical area, we can leverage the following strategy:

1. **Extract and Sort x-coordinates**: Sort the points based on their x-coordinates.
2. **Compute Maximum Gap**: Calculate the differences between successive x-coordinates to find the maximum vertical area width.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int maxWidthOfVerticalArea(int[][] points) {
        // Edge case: when the number of points is less than 2
        if (points.length < 2) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Extracting the x-coordinates
        int[] xCoords = new int[points.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
            xCoords[i] = points[i][0];
        }

        // Sorting the x-coordinates
        Arrays.sort(xCoords);

        // Finding the maximum gap between consecutive x-coordinates
        int maxGap = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < xCoords.length; i++) {
            int gap = xCoords[i] - xCoords[i - 1];
            if (gap > maxGap) {
                maxGap = gap;
            }
        }

        return maxGap;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[][] points = { {8,7}, {9,9}, {7,4}, {9,7} };
        System.out.println(solution.maxWidthOfVerticalArea(points)); // Output: 1
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting**: The major time-consuming step is sorting the x-coordinates, which takes `O(n log n)` time complexity where `n` is the number of points.
2. **Finding the Maximum Gap**: This step is `O(n)`, as we iterate through the sorted coordinates.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step and is `O(n log n)`.

### Summary

This solution effectively handles the problem by focusing on sorting the x-coordinates and then finding the maximum gap between successive coordinates. This approach ensures that we cover all potential vertical areas efficiently.
