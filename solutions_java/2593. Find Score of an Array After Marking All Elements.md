[Leetcode 2593. Find Score of an Array After Marking All Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2593)
### Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` of length `n`, let's define a procedure to calculate a score for this array according to the following algorithm:
1. Initialize `score = 0`.
2. Repeat until the array is empty:
   - Choose the smallest element from the array (`minVal`).
   - Add `minVal` to the `score`.
   - Remove `minVal` and its neighbors from the array. Neighbors of `minVal` are the elements which are next to it in the `nums` array.
   
Your task is to implement the procedure to find the score of the array after marking all elements out.

### Example
```java
Input: nums = [2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 2]
Output: 5
Explanation:
First, we pick the smallest number which is 1, add 1 to score and remove its neighbors, resulting in [2, 4, 5, 2].
Next, we pick the smallest number from the remaining array which is 2, add 2 to score and remove its neighbors, resulting in [4, 5].
Last, we pick the smallest number from the remaining array which is 4, add 4 to score and the array becomes empty.
Score = 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are there any constraints on the values within the array?**
   - No particular constraints other than the usual constraints of an array containing integers.
2. **What happens if the array contains only one element?**
   - The score will simply be the value of that single element.
3. **What should be the result if the array has duplicate values?**
   - The procedure should handle duplicates appropriately by considering each instance separately.

### Strategy
1. Initialize a priority queue (min-heap) to always fetch the smallest element efficiently.
2. Use an auxiliary array or a set to keep track of the indices already removed to avoid multiple evaluations of removed elements or their neighbors.
3. Iterate until the heap is empty:
   - Extract the minimum element from the heap.
   - Check if its index and its neighbors' indices are not marked as removed.
   - Add the value to the score and mark the element and its neighbors as removed.
4. Continue until all elements are processed and removed.

### Code
```java
import java.util.*;

public class FindScoreOfArray {
    public int findScore(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        PriorityQueue<int[]> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[0]));
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            minHeap.offer(new int[]{nums[i], i});
        }

        Set<Integer> removedIndices = new HashSet<>();
        int score = 0;

        while (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
            int[] current = minHeap.poll();
            int value = current[0];
            int index = current[1];

            if (removedIndices.contains(index)) continue;

            score += value;
            removedIndices.add(index);
            if (index > 0) removedIndices.add(index - 1);
            if (index < n - 1) removedIndices.add(index + 1);
        }

        return score;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FindScoreOfArray solution = new FindScoreOfArray();
        int[] nums = {2, 1, 3, 4, 5, 2};
        System.out.println(solution.findScore(nums));  // Output: 7
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Heap Operations**: Building the initial heap takes \(O(n \log n)\) and each extract-min operation is \(O(\log n)\).
- **Overall Time Complexity**: Since each element is processed at most once, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).
  
### Space Complexity
- **Space for Heap and Set**: Both the heap and set will take \(O(n)\) space in the worst case.
- **Total Space Complexity**: The total space complexity is \(O(n)\).
