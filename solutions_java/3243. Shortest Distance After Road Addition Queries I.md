[Leetcode 3243. Shortest Distance After Road Addition Queries I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3243)
### Problem Statement
You are given an undirected graph containing `n` nodes numbered from 1 to n. The graph is initialized with no edges initially. You are provided with a list of `m` roads, where `roads[i] = [u, v, w]` indicates that there is an undirected road between nodes `u` and `v` with a distance of `w`. You need to handle queries about the shortest path in the graph after a new road is added. Each query is given in the form `queries[j] = [u, v]` and you have to return the shortest path distance from node `u` to node `v` after adding each query road.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the constraints on `n` (number of nodes), `m` (number of roads), and the number of queries?
   - Are there any constraints on the values of `w` (weights of the roads)?
   - What should be the output if there is no path between two nodes after adding a query road?

2. **Graph Characteristics:**
   - Can the graph contain cycles?
   - Are the roads bi-directional?

3. **Query Specifications:**
   - Will any query add the same road more than once?

### Strategy
1. **Data Structure for Graph:**
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the graph.
   - Use a priority queue (min-heap) for Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path efficiently.

2. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query, temporarily add the query road to the graph.
   - Use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the start node `u` to the end node `v`.
   - Remove the temporarily added road after processing the query.

3. **Dijkstra's Algorithm:**
   - Initialize distances to all other nodes as infinity and to the start node as 0.
   - Use a priority queue to repeatedly extend the shortest known path so far to find shortest paths to all reachable nodes.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Ensure that the algorithm gracefully handles cases where nodes are not connected.
   - Handle large graphs efficiently by using appropriate data structures.

### Time Complexity
- Building the initial adjacency list: O(m)
- For each query:
  - Adding the road: O(1)
  - Dijkstra's algorithm: O((n + m) log n)
  - Removing the road: O(1)
  
Given q queries, the overall time complexity is \( O(q \times (n + m) \log n) \).

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<Integer> shortestDistanceAfterQueries(int n, int[][] roads, int[][] queries) {
        // Step 1: Build the initial adjacency list
        List<int[]>[] graph = new ArrayList[n + 1];
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        for (int[] road : roads) {
            graph[road[0]].add(new int[]{road[1], road[2]});
            graph[road[1]].add(new int[]{road[0], road[2]});
        }

        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int[] query : queries) {
            int u = query[0], v = query[1];
            graph[u].add(new int[]{v, 1});
            graph[v].add(new int[]{u, 1});
            result.add(dijkstra(n, graph, u, v));
            graph[u].remove(graph[u].size() - 1);
            graph[v].remove(graph[v].size() - 1);
        }
        return result;
    }

    private int dijkstra(int n, List<int[]>[] graph, int src, int dest) {
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[1]));
        int[] dist = new int[n + 1];
        Arrays.fill(dist, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        dist[src] = 0;
        pq.offer(new int[]{src, 0});
        
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            int[] node = pq.poll();
            int current = node[0];
            int currentDist = node[1];
            
            if (current == dest) {
                return currentDist;
            }
            
            for (int[] neighbor : graph[current]) {
                int nextNode = neighbor[0];
                int weight = neighbor[1];
                if (currentDist + weight < dist[nextNode]) {
                    dist[nextNode] = currentDist + weight;
                    pq.offer(new int[]{nextNode, dist[nextNode]});
                }
            }
        }
        return -1; // if destination cannot be reached from source
    }
}
```

### Conclusion
This solution constructs a graph and handles each query by temporarily adding the road, running Dijkstra's algorithm, and then reverting the addition. This ensures that the performance is optimized while accurately responding to each query. However, if the number of nodes and edges are very large, other optimizations or algorithms (like A* for certain heuristic scenarios) might need to be considered.
