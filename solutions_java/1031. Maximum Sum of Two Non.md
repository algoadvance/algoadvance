[Leetcode 1031. Maximum Sum of Two Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1031)
## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and two integers `firstLen` and `secondLen`, return the maximum sum of elements in two non-overlapping subarrays of lengths `firstLen` and `secondLen`.

### Example
- Example 1:
  - Input: `nums = [0,6,5,2,2,5,1,9,4]`, `firstLen = 1`, `secondLen = 2`
  - Output: `20`
  - Explanation: The two non-overlapping subarrays are [9] from index 7 and [6,5] from index 1. Sum is 9 + 11 = 20.
- Example 2:
  - Input: `nums = [3,8,1,3,2,1,8,9,0]`, `firstLen = 3`, `secondLen = 2`
  - Output: `29`
  - Explanation: The two non-overlapping subarrays are [3,8,1] from index 0 and [8,9] from index 6. Sum is 12 + 17 = 29.
- Example 3:
  - Input: `nums = [2,1,5,6,0,9,5,0,3,8]`, `firstLen = 4`, `secondLen = 3`
  - Output: `31`
  - Explanation: The two non-overlapping subarrays are [5,6,0,9] from index 2 and [3,8] from index 8. Sum is 20 + 11 = 31.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are the integers in `nums` always non-negative?
2. Can `firstLen` and `secondLen` be larger than the length of `nums`?
3. Can the sizes of the subarrays overlap, or must they be strictly non-overlapping?

## Strategy
1. Iterate through the array while maintaining two subarray sums: one for `firstLen` and one for `secondLen`.
2. Calculate the maximum sum of the subarrays in two configurations:
   - `firstLen` subarray before `secondLen` subarray.
   - `secondLen` subarray before `firstLen` subarray.
3. Track the maximum values seen so far as we progress through the array.
4. Calculate the combined maximum sum of the non-overlapping subarrays and return it.

## Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxSumTwoNoOverlap(int[] nums, int firstLen, int secondLen) {
        return Math.max(helper(nums, firstLen, secondLen), helper(nums, secondLen, firstLen));
    }
    
    private int helper(int[] nums, int L, int M) {
        int n = nums.length;
        
        int[] prefixSum = new int[n + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            prefixSum[i + 1] = prefixSum[i] + nums[i];
        }
        
        int maxL = 0, maxLM = 0;

        for (int i = L + M; i <= n; i++) {
            maxL = Math.max(maxL, prefixSum[i - M] - prefixSum[i - M - L]);
            maxLM = Math.max(maxLM, maxL + (prefixSum[i] - prefixSum[i - M]));
        }
        
        return maxLM;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
1. The prefix sum array is calculated in `O(n)` time.
2. The main loop iterating to find the maximum sums is also executed in `O(n)` time.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`.
