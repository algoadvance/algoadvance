[Leetcode 1022. Sum of Root To Leaf Binary Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1022)
### Problem Statement
Given a binary tree where each node contains a single digit (0 or 1), each path from the root to a leaf represents a binary number. You need to find the sum of these binary numbers represented by all paths from the root to the leaves.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is a root-to-leaf path?**
   - A path that starts from the root node and ends at a leaf node (a node with no children).

2. **What should be the format of the output?**
   - The output should be an integer which is the sum of all the binary numbers represented by root-to-leaf paths.

3. **Are there any constraints on the size of the tree?**
   - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 1000]`.
   - Node values are either `0` or `1`.

### Code

Here is the Java code to solve the problem:

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */

public class Solution {
    public int sumRootToLeaf(TreeNode root) {
        return dfs(root, 0);
    }
    
    private int dfs(TreeNode node, int currentSum) {
        if (node == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        currentSum = (currentSum << 1) | node.val;
        
        if (node.left == null && node.right == null) {
            return currentSum;
        }
        
        return dfs(node.left, currentSum) + dfs(node.right, currentSum);
    }
}
```

### Strategy
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** 
   - Traverse the tree using DFS which can be implemented using recursion.
   
2. **Bit Manipulation:** 
   - To construct the binary number, use bitwise operations.
   - Shift `currentSum` to the left by 1 bit (`currentSum << 1`), then add the value of the current node (`node.val`).
   
3. **Base Case:** 
   - If the current node is `null`, return 0 since it does not contribute to any path.
   
4. **Leaf Node:** 
   - If both children of the current node are `null`, it means we have reached a leaf node. Return the `currentSum`.
   
5. **Recursive Case:** 
   - Recursively call the `dfs` method on the left and right children of the current node.
   - Sum the results of the left and right recursive calls to get the total sum for the current path.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(H), where `H` is the height of the tree. This space is used by the recursion stack. In the worst case, H = N (skewed tree), and in the best case, H = log(N) (balanced tree).
