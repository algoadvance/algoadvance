[Leetcode 168. Excel Sheet Column Title](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l168)
### Problem Statement
Given a positive integer `columnNumber`, return its corresponding column title as it appears in an Excel sheet.

For example:
```
A -> 1
B -> 2
C -> 3
...
Z -> 26
AA -> 27
AB -> 28 
...
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of `columnNumber` that we need to handle?
   - The value of `columnNumber` will be a positive integer and can be assumed to be within typical integer bounds for coding contests.
   
2. Is the output case sensitive?
   - Yes, Excel column titles are always uppercase.

### Code
```java
public class ExcelColumnTitle {
    public static String convertToTitle(int columnNumber) {
        StringBuilder columnTitle = new StringBuilder();

        while (columnNumber > 0) {
            columnNumber--; // adjust columnNumber to be zero-indexed
            int remainder = columnNumber % 26;
            columnTitle.append((char) ('A' + remainder));
            columnNumber = columnNumber / 26;
        }

        return columnTitle.reverse().toString();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test examples
        System.out.println(convertToTitle(1)); // Output: A
        System.out.println(convertToTitle(28)); // Output: AB
        System.out.println(convertToTitle(701)); // Output: ZY
    }
}
```

### Strategy
1. **Adjust to Zero-Indexed**: Decrement `columnNumber` by 1. This adjustment helps in handling the 1-based index system used in the problem description.
2. **Compute the Remainder and Character**: Extract the last character of the column title by taking modulo 26 of the `columnNumber`. This will give a number between 0 and 25, which corresponds to characters 'A' to 'Z'.
3. **Build Title**: Append the character to a `StringBuilder`.
4. **Update Column Number**: Divide the `columnNumber` by 26 to handle the next 'digit' in the sequence.
5. **Reverse the String**: After the loop, reverse the accumulated characters in `StringBuilder` because the characters were appended in a reverse order.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(log_26 N), where N is the given `columnNumber`. This is because in each iteration, we divide the number by 26, reducing the problem size logarithmically.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) for the algorithm itself, but considering the output string, the space complexity is O(log_26 N) to store the result.

The problem is approached in a straightforward and efficient manner, using basic operations and a string builder for constructing the final result. This ensures that the solution is both easy to understand and optimal for the given constraints.
