[Leetcode 1622. Fancy Sequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1622)
### Problem Statement

The problem is to design a data structure called `Fancy` that supports the following operations:
1. `void append(val)`: Appends an integer `val` to the sequence.
2. `void addAll(inc)`: Adds an integer `inc` to all existing values in the sequence.
3. `void multAll(m)``: Multiplies all existing values in the sequence by an integer `m`.
4. `int getIndex(idx)`: Gets the current value at index `idx` (0-indexed) if the sequence is not out of bounds, otherwise returns -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Bounds for Integer Values**:
   - Can the integer operations overflow, or should they be handled within the range of typical 32-bit integers?
   
   **Assumption:** Assume standard 32-bit integer handling.

2. **Frequency of Operations**:
   - Are the operations `addAll` and `multAll` expected to be called frequently compared to `append` and `getIndex`?
   
   **Assumption:** Assume all operations have equal probability of occurrence. Optimize for a balanced frequency.

3. **Maximum Length of Sequence**:
   - What is the maximum length of the sequence we should handle?
   
   **Assumption:** Handle up to the length that fits comfortably within Java's memory limits, potentially up to 10^5 elements.

### Strategy

To optimize the operations, especially `addAll` and `multAll`, we can use a lazy propagation strategy to avoid repeatedly updating the entire list. Here's the detailed strategy:

1. **append(val)**:
   - Append the value normally but store how it would be affected by future `addAll` and `multAll` operations using two additional variables `currentAdd` and `currentMul`.
   
2. **addAll(inc)**:
   - Increment a global add accumulator.

3. **multAll(m)**:
   - Multiply a global multiplier.
   - Also apply the multiplication to the global add accumulator to conform to the proper order of operations.
   
4. **getIndex(idx)**:
   - Derive the final value using the stored value for index `idx`, global add accumulator, and global multiplier to avoid making n updates for each `addAll` and `multAll`.

### Code Implementation

```java
import java.util.*;

class Fancy {
    private static final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;
    
    private List<Long> sequence;
    private long currentAdd;   // To store the accumulation of add values
    private long currentMul;   // To store the accumulation of multiply values

    public Fancy() {
        this.sequence = new ArrayList<>();
        this.currentAdd = 0;
        this.currentMul = 1;
    }
    
    public void append(int val) {
        // Normalize the input value based on current multipliers and adders
        long normalizedVal = (val - currentAdd + MOD) % MOD;
        normalizedVal = (normalizedVal * modInv(currentMul, MOD)) % MOD;
        sequence.add(normalizedVal);
    }
    
    public void addAll(int inc) {
        currentAdd = (currentAdd + inc) % MOD;
    }
    
    public void multAll(int m) {
        currentAdd = (currentAdd * m) % MOD;
        currentMul = (currentMul * m) % MOD;
    }
    
    public int getIndex(int idx) {
        if (idx >= sequence.size()) {
            return -1;
        }
        long val = sequence.get(idx);
        val = (val * currentMul) % MOD;
        val = (val + currentAdd) % MOD;
        return (int) val;
    }
    
    private long modInv(long a, long m) {
        return power(a, m - 2, m);
    }
    
    private long power(long a, long b, long mod) {
        long result = 1;
        while(b > 0) {
            if((b & 1) == 1) {
                result = result * a % mod;
            }
            a = a * a % mod;
            b >>= 1;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **append(val)**: O(1) - Direct append and normalization.
- **addAll(inc)**: O(1) - Update the global add accumulator.
- **multAll(m)**: O(1) - Update the global add and multiply accumulators.
- **getIndex(idx)**: O(1) - Direct retrieval using the stored global accumulators and index value.

This optimized approach allows the operations to be efficient even with large sequences and frequent operations.
