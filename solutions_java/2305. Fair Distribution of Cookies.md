[Leetcode 2305. Fair Distribution of Cookies](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2305)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `cookies`, where `cookies[i]` denotes the number of cookies in the `i-th` bag. You are to distribute all the bags to a group of `k` children such that the unfairness is minimized. 

Unfairness is defined as the maximum number of cookies any single child gets. You want to distribute the cookies in such a way that the maximum cookies any single child gets is as small as possible.

Return the minimum possible unfairness.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the number of children be more than the number of bags of cookies?**
   - No, each child must get at least one bag of cookies if `k >= cookies.length`.

2. **Can the number of children be zero or negative?**
   - No, `k` will always be a positive integer.

3. **Would there be any constraints on the number of cookies in each bag?**
   - The problem doesn't specify the constraints explicitly, but it can be assumed that the number of cookies in each bag is a non-negative integer.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, you can use a recursive backtracking approach with pruning. The idea is to distribute the cookies recursively and keep track of the current distribution's maximum cookie count. This will allow us to minimize the unfairness:

1. **Recursive Distribution**: For each bag of cookies, try giving it to each child and recursively solve for the remaining bags.
2. **Pruning**: If at any point a distribution has a maximum cookie count that is equal to or greater than an already known solution, skip further processing of this distribution.
3. **Backtracking**: Since every distribution attempt modifies a shared state, undo changes after recursive calls to ensure the state remains consistent for other attempts.

### Code

```java
public class FairDistributionOfCookies {
    
    public int distributeCookies(int[] cookies, int k) {
        int[] children = new int[k];
        return backtrack(cookies, children, 0, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
    }
    
    private int backtrack(int[] cookies, int[] children, int index, int result) {
        if (index == cookies.length) {
            int max = 0;
            for (int num : children) {
                max = Math.max(max, num);
            }
            return Math.min(result, max);
        } 
        
        for (int i = 0; i < children.length; i++) {
            children[i] += cookies[index];
            result = Math.min(result, backtrack(cookies, children, index + 1, result));
            children[i] -= cookies[index];
            
            // Pruning: If the current child has no cookies, no need to try further distribution as
            // it will lead to an identical or worse distribution for other children.
            if (children[i] == 0) {
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FairDistributionOfCookies solution = new FairDistributionOfCookies();
        int[] cookies = {8, 15, 10, 20, 8};
        int k = 2;
        int result = solution.distributeCookies(cookies, k);
        System.out.println("Minimum possible unfairness: " + result);  // Output example: 31
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(k^n)`, where `n` is the number of cookie bags and `k` is the number of children. This is because, in the worst-case scenario, the algorithm tries distributing each of the `n` bags to any of the `k` children. While the pruning reduces some unnecessary branches of the search space, the algorithm still explores an exponential number of possibilities in the worst case.
