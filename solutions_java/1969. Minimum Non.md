[Leetcode 1969. Minimum Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1969)
### Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer `p`. You need to find the minimum non-zero product of the elements of an array that contains exactly `2^p - 1` elements. Each element of the array is an integer in the range `[1, 2^p - 1]`, inclusive. Since the product can be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What constraints should I be aware of?**
   - The integer `p` is always a positive integer.
   - The numbers in the array are all within the range `[1, 2^p - 1]`.

2. **Is there a maximum value for `p`?**
   - Yes, typically `p` can be up to 60 according to the problem on LeetCode.

3. **How to handle overflow conditions?**
   - Use modular arithmetic with a modulus of `10^9 + 7`.

### Strategy

The maximum element of the array is `max_val = 2^p - 1`. To achieve the minimum non-zero product, consider the pairing of numbers `(i, max_val - i)` for `i` from `1` to `max_val-1`.

The pairs `(1, max_val-1), (2, max_val-2), ..., (half, max_val-half)` should be considered where `half = (2^p - 1) / 2`.

Interestingly, for large values, one of the best strategies is to use modular exponential properties to keep the product’s size manageable. The pair product can be visualized as:

\[ (max_val - 1)^{(max_val - 1)/2} \]

Finally, the result would be:

\[ result = (max_val) \cdot (max_val - 1)^{(max_val - 1)/2} \mod (10^9 + 7) \]

This strategy leverages properties of modular arithmetic for exponential calculations.

### Code

Here’s the implementation in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public static final int MOD = 1000000007;
    
    public long modExp(long base, long exp, int mod) {
        long res = 1;
        while (exp > 0) {
            if ((exp & 1) == 1) {
                res = res * base % mod;
            }
            base = base * base % mod;
            exp >>= 1;
        }
        return res;
    }

    public int minNonZeroProduct(int p) {
        long maxVal = (1L << p) - 1;
        long exp = maxVal / 2;
        long product = modExp(maxVal - 1, exp, MOD);
        product = (product * (maxVal % MOD)) % MOD;
        return (int) product;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(\log(max\_val))\) due to the exponentiation by squaring method used in `modExp`.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), since we are only using a few additional variables regardless of the input size.
