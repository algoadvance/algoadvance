[Leetcode 1223. Dice Roll Simulation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1223)
## Problem Statement

A die simulator generates a random number from 1 to 6 for each roll. You introduced a restriction that consecutive rolls of the same value are forbidden. You want to find the number of possible distinct sequences that can be obtained with `n` rolls. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Does the restriction apply across all rolls or just for the immediate previous roll?**
   - It applies only to consecutive rolls; the same number shouldn't appear immediately after itself.

2. **Should sequences be valid if they have the same numbers appearing but not consecutively?**
   - Yes, as long as the same number does not follow itself consecutively, it's valid.

3. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - Typically in such problems `n` can be large, up to 5000 based on historical constraint patterns in similar problems but it can vary.

With these clarifications, let's define our approach.

## Strategy

### Dynamic Programming

We'll use dynamic programming (DP) to build our solution:

1. Define a DP table `dp[i][j]` where `i` represents the number of rolls so far and `j` represents the option of ending with the number `j`.
   
2. Use an auxiliary DP table `sum[i]` where `sum[i]` represents the total number of sequences of length `i`.

3. Initialize:
    - `dp[1][j] = 1` for all `j` because with one roll, each number can only be rolled once.
    - `sum[1] = 6` because there are 6 possibilities with one roll.

4. Transition:
    - For each possible roll `i` starting from 2 to `n`, update:
      ```java
      dp[i][j] = (sum[i-1] - dp[i-1][j]) % MOD
      ```
    - This ensures that we add new rolls without duplicating the consecutive values.
    
5. Sum up all the end-values for our final result.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class DiceRollSimulation {
    public static final int MOD = 1000000007;

    public int dieSimulator(int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 0;

        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][6];
        int[] sum = new int[n + 1];
        Arrays.fill(dp[1], 1);
        sum[1] = 6;

        for (int i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 6; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = (sum[i-1] - dp[i-1][j] + MOD) % MOD;
            }
            sum[i] = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < 6; j++) {
                sum[i] = (sum[i] + dp[i][j]) % MOD;
            }
        }

        return sum[n];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DiceRollSimulation drs = new DiceRollSimulation();
        System.out.println(drs.dieSimulator(2)); // Example call, should return 30 for `n = 2`
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is `O(n * k)`, where `n` is the number of rolls and `k = 6` is the number of faces on the die.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is `O(n * k)` due to the DP table storage.

This solution efficiently computes the number of valid sequences while satisfying the problem's constraints and ensuring optimal time complexity for large inputs.
