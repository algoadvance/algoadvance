[Leetcode 1529. Minimum Suffix Flips](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1529)
### Problem Statement:

You are given a binary string `target` of length `n`. You have another binary string `initial` of length `n` that is initialized to all zeros. You want to transform `initial` into `target` by doing some number of operations. In each operation, you can pick an arbitrary suffix of the string `initial` and flip all the bits in this suffix (i.e., turn `1` into `0` and vice versa). Return the minimum number of operations needed to transform `initial` into `target`.

Example:
```
Input: target = "10111"
Output: 3
```

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Can the input string have any characters other than '0' and '1'?**
   - No, the input string will only consist of '0's and '1's.

2. **Is the initial string always of the same length as the target string and initialized to all zeros?**
   - Yes, the initial string is always of the same length and initialized to all zeros.

3. **What is the maximum length of the string?**
   - The problem description does not specify, but LeetCode typically allows for input lengths up to 10^5.

### Strategy:

1. **Initial Idea:** Since the `initial` string is all zeros, every flip operation will either match or mismatch the target at specific positions. Our task is to count the number of transitions between different characters in the `target` string.
2. **Detailed Plan:**
   - Traverse the target string and count the number of times the character changes from '0' to '1' or from '1' to '0'.
   - Every such transition would correspond to at least one flip operation needed to create the required suffix match.
   - The number of flip operations is essentially the count of these transitions plus one if the first character in `target` is '1'.

### Code:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minFlips(String target) {
        int n = target.length();
        int flips = 0;
        
        // Iterate through the target string to count the number of transitions
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            // If we are at the start of the string or there's a transition from 0 to 1 or 1 to 0
            if (i == 0 && target.charAt(i) == '1' || 
                i > 0 && target.charAt(i) != target.charAt(i - 1)) {
                flips++;
            }
        }
        
        return flips;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.minFlips("10111"));  // Output: 3
        System.out.println(sol.minFlips("101"));    // Output: 3
        System.out.println(sol.minFlips("00000"));  // Output: 0
        System.out.println(sol.minFlips("11111"));  // Output: 1
    }
}
```
### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `target` string. We traverse the string once to count the transitions.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), no additional space is required except for a few integer variables.

This approach efficiently counts the minimum number of flips required to transform the `initial` string into the `target` string with a linear time complexity.
