[Leetcode 2488. Count Subarrays With Median K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2488)
### Problem Statement:
Given an array `nums` and two integers `k` and `length`, count the number of subarrays of length `length` that have `k` as their median. The median of a subarray of odd length is the middle element after sorting, and for even length subarrays, it is the average of the two middle elements.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Constraints:** What are the constraints on `n` (length of `nums`), `k` and `length`?
2. **Data Range:** Are the elements of `nums` restricted to a specific range, like non-negative integers or any integer?
3. **Output Type:** Should the function return an integer representing the count or is it okay to return in another format?

Assuming a typical constraint like:
- The length of the array, `n`, is in the range [1, 10^5].
- The elements of the array are within the integer range.
- `k` is one of the elements in `nums`.
- `length` is less than or equal to the length of the array.

### Strategy:
1. **Sliding Window Approach:** Use a sliding window of size `length` to go through the array.
2. **Tracking Median:** For each subarray of length `length`, track the median.
3. **Count Valid Subarrays:** Count the subarrays where the median is `k`.

Given the sorted nature required for determining the median and performance constraints, a more detailed plan might involve:
- Using counting sort to keep track of the frequency of elements within the current window.
- Adjust the counting sort structure as the window slides.

### Time Complexity:
- The overall approach involves maintaining and updating a frequency table over the sliding window, which should give us an efficient solution, especially with counting sort giving O(1) access times.

Let's work on the implementation.

### Code:

```java
import java.util.TreeMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class CountSubarraysWithMedianK {
    public int countSubarrays(int[] nums, int k, int length) {
        // Early exit if the length is larger than the array size
        if (length > nums.length) return 0;

        // Initial count of subarrays with median k
        int count = 0;
        
        // Using TreeMap to keep current sliding window in sorted order
        TreeMap<Integer, Integer> window = new TreeMap<>();
        
        // Sliding window on nums, with some initial fillers from the start
        for (int i = 0; i < length - 1; ++i) {
            window.put(nums[i], window.getOrDefault(nums[i], 0) + 1);
        }
        
        for (int i = length - 1; i < nums.length; ++i) {
            // Add the new element into the window
            window.put(nums[i], window.getOrDefault(nums[i], 0) + 1);

            // Determine the median
            int median = findMedian(window, length);
            if (median == k) {
                count++;
            }
            
            // Prepare for the next iteration by removing the oldest element
            int outgoing = nums[i - length + 1];
            if (window.get(outgoing) == 1) {
                window.remove(outgoing);
            } else {
                window.put(outgoing, window.get(outgoing) - 1);
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }

    private int findMedian(TreeMap<Integer, Integer> window, int length) {
        int count = 0;
        int median = 0;

        // Need to find the (length+1)/2-th smallest element for odd or average of len/2 and (len/2)+1 for even
        int medianPos = (length + 1) / 2;
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : window.entrySet()) {
            count += entry.getValue();
            if (count >= medianPos) {
                median = entry.getKey();
                break;
            }
        }
        return median;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CountSubarraysWithMedianK solution = new CountSubarraysWithMedianK();
        int[] nums = {1, 3, 2, 3, 5};
        int k = 3;
        int length = 3;
        int result = solution.countSubarrays(nums, k, length);
        System.out.println(result);  // Expected output: 2 ("3,2,3" and "2,3,5")
    }
}
```

### Explanation:
- Use a `TreeMap` to keep track of the elements in the current window in sorted order.
- Slide the window across the array, adding the new element and removing the old one as you go.
- Use a helper method to find the median from the `TreeMap`.
- If the median is `k`, increment the count.

This solution ensures that the sliding window is managed efficiently, keeping within acceptable performance limits for large arrays.
