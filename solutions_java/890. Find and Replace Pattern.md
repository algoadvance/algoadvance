[Leetcode 890. Find and Replace Pattern](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l890)
## Problem Statement

You are given a list of strings `words` and a string `pattern`. You want to find all strings in `words` that match the given pattern. A string matches the pattern if there is a bijection (one-to-one and onto mapping) between a letter in the pattern and a letter in the string.

In other words, for each character in the `pattern` there's a unique corresponding character in the string and vice versa.

For example, given the pattern "abb", the strings "mee" and "aqq" match the pattern, but "ccc" does not.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: words = ["abc","deq","mee","aqq","dkd","ccc"], pattern = "abb"
Output: ["mee","aqq"]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: words = ["a","b","c"], pattern = "a"
Output: ["a","b","c"]
```

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= words.length <= 50
- 1 <= pattern.length <= 20

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the words and the pattern contain non-lowercase English letters?
   **A:** No, as per problem constraints, `words` and `pattern` contain only lowercase English letters.
   
2. **Q:** What should be returned if no words match the pattern?
   **A:** An empty list should be returned if no words match the pattern.

3. **Q:** Should the order of results be maintained as in the input list?
   **A:** Yes, results should appear in the same order as they do in the input.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to check if thereâ€™s a bijection (one-to-one correspondence) between the characters in the pattern and each word. To implement this, we can follow these steps:

1. **Data Structures:** Use two hash maps (dictionaries):
   - `pattern_to_word`: Maps each character in the `pattern` to a corresponding character in a `word`.
   - `word_to_pattern`: Maps each character in the `word` to a corresponding character in the `pattern`.

2. **Iterate:** For each word in the list:
   - Check the lengths of the word and the pattern. If they are not the same, they cannot match.
   - For each character pair (pattern character, word character):
     - Ensure the mapping in both hash maps is consistent.
     - If any inconsistency is found, break and continue to the next word.
     - If no inconsistency is found for the whole word, add it to the result list.

3. **Edge Cases:** Handle edge cases where the lengths do not match or mappings are inconsistent.

## Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;

public class FindAndReplacePattern {
    
    public List<String> findAndReplacePattern(String[] words, String pattern) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (String word : words) {
            if (matchesPattern(word, pattern)) {
                result.add(word);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    private boolean matchesPattern(String word, String pattern) {
        if (word.length() != pattern.length()) {
            return false;
        }
        
        Map<Character, Character> patternToWord = new HashMap<>();
        Map<Character, Character> wordToPattern = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
            char wChar = word.charAt(i);
            char pChar = pattern.charAt(i);
            
            if (patternToWord.containsKey(pChar)) {
                if (patternToWord.get(pChar) != wChar) {
                    return false;
                }
            } else {
                patternToWord.put(pChar, wChar);
            }
            
            if (wordToPattern.containsKey(wChar)) {
                if (wordToPattern.get(wChar) != pChar) {
                    return false;
                }
            } else {
                wordToPattern.put(wChar, pChar);
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FindAndReplacePattern solution = new FindAndReplacePattern();
        String[] words = {"abc", "deq", "mee", "aqq", "dkd", "ccc"};
        String pattern = "abb";
        System.out.println(solution.findAndReplacePattern(words, pattern)); // Output: [mee, aqq]
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- Let `n` be the number of words and `m` be the length of the longest word (or pattern).
- Checking each word against the pattern: O(m)
- Checking all words: O(n * m)

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n * m)**.
