[Leetcode 482. License Key Formatting](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l482)
### Problem Statement

You are given a license key represented as a string `s` that consists of only alphanumeric characters and dashes. The string is separated into `N + 1` groups by `N` dashes. You are also given an integer `k`.

We want to reformat the string `s` such that each group contains exactly `k` characters, except for the first group, which could be shorter than `k` but still at least 1 character. Furthermore, there should be a dash inserted between two groups and all lowercase letters should be converted to uppercase.

Return the reformatted license key.

**Example:**
```
Input: s = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", k = 4
Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"
Explanation: The string s has been split into two parts, each with 4 characters.
```

**Example:**
```
Input: s = "2-5g-3-J", k = 2
Output: "2-5G-3J"
Explanation: The string s has been split into three parts, each with 2 characters except the first part as mentioned before.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the given inputs always valid?**
   - Yes, the inputs are always valid as specified in the problem.
   
2. **Are we allowed to use additional data structures?**
   - Yes, you can use additional data structures as necessary for simplification.

3. **Does the dash existing in the initial string count in the length of the final formatted groups?**
   - No, only alphanumeric characters count towards the length of final formatted groups. The dashes are separators.

4. **Is there a specific format for output (e.g., upper case)?**
   - Yes, as mentioned, all characters should be converted to upper case.

### Strategy

1. **Remove Dashes and Convert to Uppercase:**
   - Iterate through the string `s`, remove all the dashes, and convert any lowercase letters to uppercase.

2. **Determine Grouping:**
   - Calculate the size of the first group. This is given by `len % k` where `len` is the length of the string after removing dashes.
   - The remaining groups will each be of size `k`.

3. **Build Final String:**
   - Use a `StringBuilder` to construct the reformatted string by appending characters and adding dashes where necessary.

### Code

```java
public class LicenseKeyFormatting {
    public String licenseKeyFormatting(String s, int k) {
        // Remove all dashes and convert to uppercase
        StringBuilder cleanString = new StringBuilder();
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c != '-') {
                cleanString.append(Character.toUpperCase(c));
            }
        }
        
        // Get the length of cleaned string
        int len = cleanString.length();
        int firstGroupLength = len % k == 0 ? k : len % k;
        
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        int i = 0;
        
        // Append the first group
        result.append(cleanString.substring(i, i + firstGroupLength));
        i += firstGroupLength;
        
        // Append the remaining groups with dashes
        while (i < len) {
            result.append('-');
            result.append(cleanString.substring(i, i + k));
            i += k;
        }
        
        return result.toString();
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LicenseKeyFormatting formatter = new LicenseKeyFormatting();
        System.out.println(formatter.licenseKeyFormatting("5F3Z-2e-9-w", 4)); // Output: 5F3Z-2E9W
        System.out.println(formatter.licenseKeyFormatting("2-5g-3-J", 2));    // Output: 2-5G-3J
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input string. This accounts for processing each character to strip dashes and convert to uppercase, and for constructing the final string.
  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, because we are storing the intermediate cleaned string and the final result string.
