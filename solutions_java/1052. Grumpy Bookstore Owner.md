[Leetcode 1052. Grumpy Bookstore Owner](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1052)
### Problem Statement
Leetcode Problem 1052: **Grumpy Bookstore Owner**

Today, the bookstore owner has a store open for `minutes` customers only. Every customer `customers[i]` goes to find a book in the `i-th` minute, and leaves the store.

At every minute, the bookstore owner can either be grumpy or not. If they are not grumpy, they will be in a good mood and the number of customers for that minute will be added to the total count of satisfied customers. However, if the owner is grumpy, the number of customers they will serve that minute will not satisfy the customers and will not add to the satisfied customers unless the bookstore owner keeps "not grumpy" for a "grumpy free" period of `X` minutes.

Your task is to determine the maximum number of customers that can be satisfied, given the following:
- `customers[i]` is an array of integers representing the number of customers in the store at the i-th minute.
- `grumpy[i]` is an array of integers where `grumpy[i]` is `0` if the bookstore owner is not grumpy at minute `i`, and `1` if they are grumpy.
- `X` is an integer representing the maximum number of `grumpy free` minutes.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **How large can the `customers` and `grumpy` arrays be?**
   - The arrays can each have a length between 1 and 20000.

2. **What are the possible values for each element in `customers`?**
   - Each element in `customers` can be an integer between 1 and 1000.

3. **What are the possible values for each element in `grumpy`?**
   - Each element in `grumpy` can be either `0` or `1`.

4. **What is the range for `X`?**
   - `X` can be between 1 and the length of the `customers` array.

### Strategy
1. **Always Satisfied Customers**: Calculate how many customers are always satisfied (i.e., the owner is not grumpy at those times).
2. **Additional Satisfied Customers During Grumpy Free Period**: Use a sliding window approach to calculate the maximum number of additional satisfied customers during any `X` minute grumpy-free period.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxSatisfied(int[] customers, int[] grumpy, int X) {
        int alwaysSatisfied = 0;
        int maxAdditionalSatisfied = 0;
        int additionalSatisfied = 0;

        // Calculate the base always satisfied customers
        for (int i = 0; i < customers.length; i++) {
            if (grumpy[i] == 0) {
                alwaysSatisfied += customers[i];
            }
        }

        // Calculate the additional satisfied customers in the initial window
        for (int i = 0; i < X; i++) {
            if (grumpy[i] == 1) {
                additionalSatisfied += customers[i];
            }
        }
        maxAdditionalSatisfied = additionalSatisfied;

        // Slide the window across the rest of the array
        for (int i = X; i < customers.length; i++) {
            if (grumpy[i - X] == 1) {
                additionalSatisfied -= customers[i - X];
            }
            if (grumpy[i] == 1) {
                additionalSatisfied += customers[i];
            }
            maxAdditionalSatisfied = Math.max(maxAdditionalSatisfied, additionalSatisfied);
        }

        return alwaysSatisfied + maxAdditionalSatisfied;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the `customers` (or `grumpy`) array. This is because we perform a single pass to calculate the always satisfied customers, and another pass to calculate the maximum additional satisfied customers using the sliding window approach.
