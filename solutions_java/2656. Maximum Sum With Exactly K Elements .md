[Leetcode 2656. Maximum Sum With Exactly K Elements ](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2656)
### Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Your task is to find the maximum sum you can achieve by selecting exactly `k` elements from the array. If it is impossible to select `k` elements, return `0`.

The sum should be calculated after adding `1` to each of the selected elements.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `nums` contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, `nums` can contain negative numbers.
2. **Can the number of elements in `nums` be smaller than `k`?**
   - Yes, in such cases, the function should return `0` as it is impossible to select `k` elements.
3. **Do we have any constraints on the values within `nums` or the range of `k`?**
   - There are no additional constraints provided beyond standard integer limits.

### Strategy
1. **Check Feasibility:** First, we need to check if the length of `nums` is smaller than `k`. If it is smaller, we return `0` since it's not possible to select `k` elements.
2. **Sort the Array:** Sort the array in descending order to easily pick the largest `k` elements.
3. **Sum the Largest Elements:** Add the largest `k` elements from the sorted array after incrementing each by 1.

### Pseudocode
1. Check if `nums.length < k`. If true, return `0`.
2. Sort `nums` in descending order.
3. Initialize `maxSum` to `0`.
4. Iterate over the first `k` elements of the sorted array and add `element + 1` to `maxSum`.
5. Return `maxSum`.

### Code
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.Collections;

public class MaximumSumWithKElements {
    public int maxSum(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        if (n < k) {
            return 0;  // Impossible to select k elements
        }

        // Use boxed integers to allow sorting with Collections.reverseOrder()
        Integer[] numsBoxed = Arrays.stream(nums).boxed().toArray(Integer[]::new);
        Arrays.sort(numsBoxed, Collections.reverseOrder());

        int maxSum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            maxSum += numsBoxed[i] + 1;  // Add 1 to each selected element
        }

        return maxSum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximumSumWithKElements solution = new MaximumSumWithKElements();
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int k = 3;
        System.out.println(solution.maxSum(nums, k));  // Output: 15 (5+1 + 4+1 + 3+1)
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting:** The complexity of sorting `nums` is `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the length of the array.
- **Summation:** Summing up the first `k` elements takes `O(k)`.
- **Overall:** The overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`, dominated by the sorting step.
