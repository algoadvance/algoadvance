[Leetcode 2353. Design a Food Rating System](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2353)
### Problem Statement

Design a food rating system that can do the following:
1. **FoodRating(food, cuisine, rating)**: Initialize the rating of a food item.
2. **void changeRating(food, newRating)**: Update the rating of the given food item.
3. **string highestRated(cuisine)**: Return the name of the food item in the given cuisine with the highest rating. If there is a tie, return the food item that is lexicographically smaller.

Implement the `FoodRatings` class.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can multiple foods have the same name within the same cuisine?
   - No, each food name within a cuisine will be unique.
2. What should be the initial rating when adding a food item?
   - You are provided with the initial rating for each food item.
3. If two foods have the same rating, how are ties resolved?
   - Ties are broken by returning the food item that is lexicographically smaller.

### Implementation Strategy
To solve this problem, we need a system to efficiently update and retrieve food ratings while keeping track of the highest-rated food within each cuisine. Here’s a high-level approach:

1. **Data Structure Setup:**
   - Use a `Map<String, TreeMap<String, Integer>> cuisineToFoods` to map each cuisine to a `TreeMap` of food to ratings. 
     - The `TreeMap` preserves the order such that the first entry will be the lexicographically smallest food.
   - Use a `Map<String, Integer> foodToRating` to keep the current rating of each food.
   - Use a `Map<String, String> foodToCuisine` to map each food to its cuisine for quick lookup during rating updates.

2. **Add Food:**
   - When adding a new food, insert it into the respective `TreeMap` in the `cuisineToFoods` and update both `foodToRating` and `foodToCuisine` maps.

3. **Change Rating:**
   - Update the rating in the `foodToRating` map.
   - Update the `TreeMap` entry under the respective cuisine.

4. **Get Highest Rated Food:**
   - Retrieve the first entry from the `TreeMap` of the specified cuisine in `cuisineToFoods`.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class FoodRatings {

    private Map<String, Integer> foodToRating;
    private Map<String, String> foodToCuisine;
    private Map<String, TreeMap<String, Integer>> cuisineToFoods;

    public FoodRatings(String[] foods, String[] cuisines, int[] ratings) {
        foodToRating = new HashMap<>();
        foodToCuisine = new HashMap<>();
        cuisineToFoods = new HashMap<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < foods.length; i++) {
            foodToRating.put(foods[i], ratings[i]);
            foodToCuisine.put(foods[i], cuisines[i]);

            cuisineToFoods.putIfAbsent(cuisines[i], new TreeMap<>((a, b) -> {
                int cmp = !ratingCmp(a, b, cuisines[i]).equals(0) ? ratingCmp(a, b, cuisines[i]) : a.compareTo(b);
                return cmp;
            }));
            cuisineToFoods.get(cuisines[i]).put(foods[i], ratings[i]);
        }
    }

    public void changeRating(String food, int newRating) {
        String cuisine = foodToCuisine.get(food);
        int oldRating = foodToRating.get(food);
        
        // Remove the old entry
        cuisineToFoods.get(cuisine).remove(food);
        
        // Update the rating
        foodToRating.put(food, newRating);
        
        // Insert the new entry
        cuisineToFoods.get(cuisine).put(food, newRating);
    }

    public String highestRated(String cuisine) {
        return cuisineToFoods.get(cuisine).firstKey();
    }

    private Integer ratingCmp(String food1, String food2, String cuisine) {
        return foodToRating.get(food2).compareTo(foodToRating.get(food1));
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] foods = {"burger", "pizza", "salad"};
        String[] cuisines = {"American", "Italian", "Italian"};
        int[] ratings = {5, 7, 8};

        FoodRatings obj = new FoodRatings(foods, cuisines, ratings);
        System.out.println(obj.highestRated("Italian"));
        obj.changeRating("salad", 6);
        System.out.println(obj.highestRated("Italian"));
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization (constructor)**: Each insertion and setup operation is `O(log n)` for the TreeMap insertion where `n` is the number of foods.
- **changeRating()**: Removing and adding items in TreeMap both take `O(log n)`.
- **highestRated()**: Retrieving the highest-rated food is `O(1)` since it’s always the first key in the TreeMap.

This approach ensures that the operations are efficient and maintain the required order and ratings.
