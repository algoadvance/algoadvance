[Leetcode 2138. Divide a String Into Groups of Size k](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2138)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` of length `n` and an integer `k`. You need to divide the string into groups of size `k`. Each group should be a `substring` of s. You should also ensure that the last group is the same size as all the other groups or longer. If the last group of the string is shorter than `k`` characters, pad additional characters to ensure all groups are of the same length.

For instance, if the last group is shorter than `k` characters, fill the remaining positions with the character `'*'`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input string `s` be empty?
2. What characters should we use for padding in the last group? (Assuming '*' based on problem description)
3. Can `k` be larger than the length of the string `s`?

Assuming that `k` will always be a positive integer and the padding character is `'*'`.

### Strategy
1. Initialize an empty list to store the resulting groups.
2. Iterate through the string in steps of size `k`.
3. Slice the substring of size `k` from the current starting index and add it to the list.
4. Check if the length of the current substring is less than `k`. If so, pad it with `' * '` to make its length equal to `k`.
5. Repeat until all slices are processed.
6. Return the list of groups.

### Code
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public List<String> divideString(String s, int k, char fill) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int n = s.length();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i += k) {
            StringBuilder group = new StringBuilder();
            int remainingLength = (i + k <= n) ? k : n - i;
            group.append(s, i, i + remainingLength);

            while (group.length() < k) {
                group.append(fill);
            }

            result.add(group.toString());
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.divideString("abcdefghi", 3, '*')); // Output: [abc, def, ghi]
        System.out.println(sol.divideString("abcdefghij", 3, '*')); // Output: [abc, def, ghi, j**]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. We iterate through each character of the string exactly once to construct the substrings.
- The space complexity is O(n) for storing the result list of divided groups.

This approach ensures that each group is correctly padded and all groups are of size `k` or extended to size `k` if the last group is shorter than `k` characters.
