[Leetcode 801. Minimum Swaps To Make Sequences Increasing](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l801)
### Problem Statement

We are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of the same length. The arrays are both initially strictly increasing sequences. We need to make both arrays strictly increasing by performing the minimum number of swap operations. In one swap operation, you can swap `nums1[i]` with `nums2[i]`.

Return the minimum number of swaps needed to make both arrays strictly increasing.

Example:
```
Input: nums1 = [1, 3, 5, 4], nums2 = [1, 2, 3, 7]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
- Swap `nums1[3]` and `nums2[3]`, then the sequences are:
  nums1 = [1, 3, 5, 7], nums2 = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Elements**: What is the range of values that the elements of `nums1` and `nums2` can take?
   - Typically integers. We assume standard integer ranges until specified otherwise.
   
2. **Array Length**: What is the maximum length of the arrays that we need to handle?
   - Assuming the problem does not surpass typical constraints for interview problems, so up to around 10^5 elements.

3. **Can array lengths be zero or one?**: What should be the behavior if the arrays contain zero or one element?
   - With lengths zero or one, no swaps are needed to maintain strictly increasing order.

### Strategy

We can use dynamic programming to solve the problem. The main idea is to maintain two states for each position in the arrays:
1. **`keep[i]`**: Minimum number of swaps needed to make the sequences increasing up to position `i` without swapping `nums1[i]` and `nums2[i]`.
2. **`swap[i]`**: Minimum number of swaps needed to make the sequences increasing up to position `i` with swapping `nums1[i]` and `nums2[i]`.

Initialize:
- `keep[0]` = 0 (since no move is required to keep the first pair as they are).
- `swap[0]` = 1 (one swap is needed to swap the first pair).

For each `i` from `1` to `n-1`, update `keep[i]` and `swap[i]` based on the conditions to ensure increasing sequences:
- If both `nums1[i] > nums1[i-1]` and `nums2[i] > nums2[i-1]`, then:
  - Temporary to maintain the current state: `keep[i]` = `keep[i-1]`
  - Temporary to maintain the swap state: `swap[i]` = `swap[i-1] + 1`
- If both `nums1[i] > nums2[i-1]` and `nums2[i] > nums1[i-1]`, then:
  - Temporary to maintain a swap and then no swap or vice versa: `keep[i]` = `min(keep[i], swap[i-1])`
  - Temporary to maintain the swap state followed by no swap or vice versa: `swap[i]` = `min(swap[i], keep[i-1] + 1)`

Finally, the answer is the minimum of `keep[n-1]` and `swap[n-1]`.

### Code

```java
public class MinimumSwapsIncreasing {
    public int minSwap(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int n = nums1.length;
        int[] keep = new int[n];
        int[] swap = new int[n];
        
        keep[0] = 0;
        swap[0] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            keep[i] = swap[i] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            
            if (nums1[i] > nums1[i - 1] && nums2[i] > nums2[i - 1]) {
                keep[i] = keep[i - 1];
                swap[i] = swap[i - 1] + 1;
            }
            if (nums1[i] > nums2[i - 1] && nums2[i] > nums1[i - 1]) {
                keep[i] = Math.min(keep[i], swap[i - 1]);
                swap[i] = Math.min(swap[i], keep[i - 1] + 1);
            }
        }
        
        return Math.min(keep[n - 1], swap[n - 1]);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input arrays `nums1` and `nums2`. Each position in the arrays is processed a constant number of times leading to linear time complexity.
   
The space complexity is also **O(n)** due to the `keep` and `swap` arrays used for dynamic programming. However, space optimization to **O(1)** could be possible by only keeping track of the previous state at each step.
