[Leetcode 3131. Find the Integer Added to Array I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3131)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `original` and another integer array `added` which is identical to `original` with exactly one integer added to it. Your task is to find the integer that was added to `original` to get `added`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the added integer be a duplicate of an integer already present in the `original` array?
   - Yes, it can be a duplicate.
2. What will be the size constraints on the `original` array?
   - You can assume the length of `original` will be at least 1 and at most 10^5.
3. Will the integer values in the arrays be within a certain range?
   - The integers in the arrays will be within the range of Java's `int` type, which is -2^31 to 2^31-1.

### Strategy

1. **Sum Comparison**: One straightforward approach is to find the sum of the elements in both arrays, and the difference between the sum of `added` and the sum of `original` will be the extra integer.
2. **HashMap Counting**: Another approach is to use a HashMap to count occurrences of each number in `original` and `added`. The element which has a higher count in `added` is the one that was added.

We will implement the first approach because it is simpler and has better performance characteristics for this problem size.

### Code

```java
public class FindAddedNumber {
    public int findAddedNumber(int[] original, int[] added) {
        int sumOriginal = 0;
        for (int num : original) {
            sumOriginal += num;
        }

        int sumAdded = 0;
        for (int num : added) {
            sumAdded += num;
        }

        return sumAdded - sumOriginal;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FindAddedNumber sol = new FindAddedNumber();
        int[] original = {4, 1, 3};
        int[] added = {4, 1, 3, 7};
        System.out.println(sol.findAddedNumber(original, added)); // Output: 7
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The approach runs in `O(n)` time, where `n` is the number of elements in the `original` array (since the `added` array is `n+1` elements).
- The space complexity is `O(1)` since we are using a few extra variables but not any additional data structures that scale with input size.

This solution is efficient and straightforward for the given problem constraints.
