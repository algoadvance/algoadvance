[Leetcode 2192. All Ancestors of a Node in a Directed Acyclic Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2192)
### Problem Statement
You are given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. The graph is represented by a 2D integer array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [from_i, to_i]` indicates that there is a directed edge from node `from_i` to node `to_i`.

Your task is to return a list of lists `ancestors`, where `ancestors[i]` is a list containing all the ancestors of node `i` sorted in ascending order.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the size of `n` and `edges`?
   - **A:** Yes, typically `n` and the number of edges will be within reasonable bounds, such as `n <= 1000` and the number of edges also within similar range.
2. **Q:** Should we assume the graph is always a valid DAG?
   - **A:** Yes, the problem guarantees that the graph is a DAG.
3. **Q:** Is it guaranteed that there are no duplicate edges?
   - **A:** Yes, you can assume there are no duplicate edges.
4. **Q:** Are the nodes provided in topologically sorted order?
   - **A:** No, you may have to perform a topological sort.

### Strategy
1. **Graph Representation:** Use an adjacency list to represent the graph.
2. **Topological Sorting:** Perform a topological sort to process nodes in a valid order.
3. **Finding Ancestors:**
   - For each node processed in topological order, track its ancestors.
   - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to propagate ancestors information to descendant nodes.
4. **Sorting Ancestors:** Ensure the ancestors list for each node is sorted.

### Code Implementation

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> getAncestors(int n, int[][] edges) {
        // Adjacency list representation of the graph
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        
        // In-degree array to help in topological sorting
        int[] inDegree = new int[n];
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            graph.get(edge[0]).add(edge[1]);
            inDegree[edge[1]]++;
        }

        // List to store ancestor lists
        List<Set<Integer>> ancestorsList = new ArrayList<>(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            ancestorsList.add(new HashSet<>());
        }

        // Queue for topological sorting
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (inDegree[i] == 0) {
                queue.offer(i);
            }
        }

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int node = queue.poll();
            
            for (int neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
                ancestorsList.get(neighbor).add(node);
                
                // Add all ancestors of the current node to the neighbor's ancestor set
                ancestorsList.get(neighbor).addAll(ancestorsList.get(node));
                
                inDegree[neighbor]--;
                if (inDegree[neighbor] == 0) {
                    queue.offer(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }

        // Convert sets to lists and sort them
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            List<Integer> sortedAncestors = new ArrayList<>(ancestorsList.get(i));
            Collections.sort(sortedAncestors);
            result.add(sortedAncestors);
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int n = 8; 
        int[][] edges = \ use example from above
        System.out.println(sol.getAncestors(n, edges));  // Example Output
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Graph Construction:** `O(E + V)`, where `E` is the number of edges and `V` is the number of vertices.
2. **Topological Sort:** `O(V + E)` for processing all nodes and edges.
3. **Propagation of Ancestors:** Each edge and node can be involved in the ancestor set operations, so in the worst case, this propagation is `O(V * E)`. 
4. **Sorting Ancestors:** Sorting each ancestors list is `O(V log V)` given that each node's ancestors can be at most `V`.

Overall complexity can be approximated as `O(V^2 * log V + V * E)` in the worst case.

Using this approach ensures that we efficiently and accurately determine the ancestors for each node in a DAG.
