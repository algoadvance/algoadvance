[Leetcode 2481. Minimum Cuts to Divide a Circle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2481)
## Problem Statement

You are given a **perfect circle**. You need to determine the **minimum** number of cuts required to divide this circle into exactly `n` equal segments. A cut is defined as a straight line that passes through the center of the circle.

### Example
- **Input:**
  ```java
  4
  ```
  **Output:**
  ```java
  2
  ```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `n` be less than or equal to 0?**
   - Since the problem expects dividing the circle into segments, the smallest valid `n` should be 1. Considering lesser values would be nonsensical in this context.
   
2. **What is the maximum possible value for `n`?**
   - This details the constraints needed to optimize the solution, but for most common purposes, we can assume it to be within the bounds of typical integer values.

3. **Is `n` guaranteed to be a positive integer?**
   - Yes, the value of `n` should be a positive integer given the problem context.

## Strategy

To identify the minimum number of cuts needed:

1. **If `n` is 1**:
   - No cuts are needed since the circle itself is already one segment.

2. **If `n` is `2`**:
   - One cut through the center suffices to split the circle into two equal segments.

3. **For values of `n` greater than `2`**:
   - If `n` is **even**: Each cut through the center can divide the circle into two additional segments. Thus, `n / 2` straight cuts will generate `n` segments.
   - If `n` is **odd**: Similarly, `n` odd segments can be achieved optimally with `n` cuts, as one cut whenever placed still requires a separate consideration.

Based on these observations, the formula can be generalized:
   - **For `n` segments**, the number of cuts required is `ceil(n / 2)`, or equivalently `(n + 1) // 2` in integer arithmetic.

## Code

```java
public class MinimumCutsCircle {
    public static int minimumCuts(int n) {
        if (n == 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        return (n + 1) / 2; // This handles both odd and even n appropriately
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(minimumCuts(1)); // Output: 0
        System.out.println(minimumCuts(2)); // Output: 1
        System.out.println(minimumCuts(3)); // Output: 2
        System.out.println(minimumCuts(4)); // Output: 2
        System.out.println(minimumCuts(5)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(1)** as we are performing a constant-time calculation regardless of the input size. It's a direct arithmetic operation with a conditional check, thus very efficient in terms of computation.
