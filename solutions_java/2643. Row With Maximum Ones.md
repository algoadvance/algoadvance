[Leetcode 2643. Row With Maximum Ones](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2643)
## Problem Statement

You are given a rectangular matrix `grid` of size `m x n`, where each cell contains either `0` or `1`.

Return the row number of the row with the maximum number of `1`s. If there are multiple rows with the same number of `1`s, return the index of the first such row. 

You may assume that the matrix `grid` has at least one row and one column.

### Example:
```
Input: grid = [[0,1,1,0],[0,0,0,0],[0,1,1,1]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The row indexed 2 has 3 ones, which is the maximum.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can there be an empty matrix?
   - No, the problem assumes the matrix has at least one row and one column.

2. Are there constraints on the grid size? 
   - We are assuming typical constraints for such problems, e.g., the number of rows and columns being in the range `[1, 1000]`.

3. How are ties handled?
   - The row with the lowest index (i.e., first occurring row) should be returned in case of a tie.

## Strategy

1. Initialize two variables to keep track of the row number with the maximum number of `1`s and the maximum count of `1`s encountered so far.
2. Iterate through each row of the `grid`.
3. For each row, count the number of `1`s.
4. Update the row index and maximum count if the current row has more `1`s compared to the previous maximum count.
5. Return the row index with the maximum number of `1`s.

## Code

```java
public class MaximumOnesRow {
    public int rowWithMaxOnes(int[][] grid) {
        int maxOnesRowIndex = -1;
        int maxOnesCount = -1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            int count = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            if (count > maxOnesCount) {
                maxOnesCount = count;
                maxOnesRowIndex = i;
            }
        }
        
        return maxOnesRowIndex;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximumOnesRow solution = new MaximumOnesRow();
        
        int[][] grid1 = {
            {0, 1, 1, 0},
            {0, 0, 0, 0},
            {0, 1, 1, 1}
        };
        
        System.out.println(solution.rowWithMaxOnes(grid1)); // Output: 2
        
        int[][] grid2 = {
            {0, 1, 1},
            {1, 1, 1},
            {0, 0, 1}
        };
        
        System.out.println(solution.rowWithMaxOnes(grid2)); // Output: 1
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of the solution is `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. This is because we are iterating through each cell of the matrix exactly once.
- Space complexity is `O(1)`, as we are only using a constant amount of extra space.

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the row with the most `1`s while adhering to the constraints.
