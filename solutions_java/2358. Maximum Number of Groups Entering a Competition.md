[Leetcode 2358. Maximum Number of Groups Entering a Competition full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2358)
## Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer `n` representing the number of participants. Your task is to count the maximum number of groups that can be formed from these participants such that each group has at least one participant, and each successive group has to contain more participants than the previous one.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can each participant be part of more than one group?**
   - No, each participant can only be part of one group.

2. **Is there any additional constraint on the total number of participants?**
   - No additional constraints are provided beyond the number of participants being a positive integer `n`.

3. **What is the expected output?**
   - The expected output is the maximum number of groups that can be formed under the given condition.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to find the maximum number of groups such that each group has more participants than the previous one. We need to derive a strategy that helps us obtain this result efficiently.

### Approach

1. **Sum of First `k` Natural Numbers:**
   - We need to ensure that the sum of participants in these groups does not exceed `n`.
   - The sum of the first `k` natural numbers is given by `k * (k + 1) / 2`.

2. **Iterate to Find Maximum `k`:**
   - We start from `k = 1` and keep adding subsequent numbers until the sum exceeds `n`.
   - The largest `k` for which the sum is still less than or equal to `n` is our answer.

### Implementation

We'll implement this strategy iteratively to find the maximum number of groups.

## Code

```java
public class MaximumNumberOfGroups {
    public int maximumGroups(int n) {
        // Initialize variables
        int totalParticipants = 0;
        int groups = 0;

        // Iteratively find the maximum number of groups
        while (totalParticipants + groups + 1 <= n) {
            groups++;
            totalParticipants += groups;
        }

        return groups;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximumNumberOfGroups solution = new MaximumNumberOfGroups();
        // Example test cases
        System.out.println(solution.maximumGroups(10)); // Output: 4 
        System.out.println(solution.maximumGroups(15)); // Output: 5 
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(âˆšn)`. Each iteration, we increment `groups` and check if the cumulative sum exceeds `n`. The number of iterations approximately equals the square root of `n`.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`. We use a constant amount of extra space for variables.

This solution leverages the arithmetic property of natural numbers sum to iteratively find the maximum possible number of groups, ensuring efficiency and clarity.
