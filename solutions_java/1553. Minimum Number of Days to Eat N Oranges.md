[Leetcode 1553. Minimum Number of Days to Eat N Oranges](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1553)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer `n`, representing the number of oranges you have. Each day you can decide to eat oranges in one of the following ways:

1. Eat one orange.
2. If the number of remaining oranges `n` is divisible by 2, then you can eat `n/2` oranges.
3. If the number of remaining oranges `n` is divisible by 3, then you can eat `2*(n/3)` oranges.

You need to return the minimum number of days to eat all `n` oranges.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can `n` be zero?
   **A:** No, `n` will always be a positive integer (1 ≤ n).

2. **Q:** Should we consider the order of operations each day?
   **A:** Yes, you need to find the minimum number of days considering the best operation order each day.

3. **Q:** What constraints are imposed on `n`?
   **A:** Typically, `1 ≤ n ≤ 2 * 10^9`.

### Strategy
To find the minimum number of days to eat all `n` oranges:
1. **Recursive Approach with Memoization:**
   - Use a recursive approach to explore all possible ways to eat the oranges, and memoize results to avoid redundant calculations.
   - For each number of oranges `n`:
     - If `n` is divisible by 2, we can eat `n/2` and the rest `n - n/2`, plus one day.
     - If `n` is divisible by 3, we can eat `2*(n/3)` and the rest `n - 2*(n/3)`, plus one day.
     - Or simply eat one orange, and solve the problem for `n-1` oranges.

### Code
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class MinimumDaysToEatOranges {
    private Map<Integer, Integer> memo = new HashMap<>();
    
    public int minDays(int n) {
        // Base case
        if (n <= 1) {
            return n;
        }
        
        // If already computed, return from memo
        if (memo.containsKey(n)) {
            return memo.get(n);
        }
        
        int days = 1 + Math.min(n % 2 + minDays(n / 2), n % 3 + minDays(n / 3));

        // Save result in memo
        memo.put(n, days);
        
        return days;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumDaysToEatOranges solver = new MinimumDaysToEatOranges();
        System.out.println(solver.minDays(10));  // Output: 4
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is difficult to state precisely due to memoization, though it significantly reduces the potential exponential complexity by avoiding redundant re-computations. Each state `n` is computed only once and stored in the hashmap, implying an almost linear complexity in terms of the number of states processed.

### Explanation
- **Base Case:** If `n <= 1`, it takes `n` days.
- **Recursive Case:** For each `n`, consider all possible operations and recursively determine the minimum days.
- **Memoization:** Store the results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.
