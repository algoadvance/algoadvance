[Leetcode 3015. Count the Number of Houses at a Certain Distance I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3015)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed 2D integer array, `houses`, where `houses[i] = [xi, yi, hi]` denotes that the `i-th` house is located at `(xi, yi)` with a height of `hi`. You are also given an integer `d`, which represents a certain distance. You need to count the number of pairs of distinct houses `(i, j)` such that the Euclidean distance between the two houses is equal to `d` and the heights of the two houses are also equal.

Write a function `count_pairs(houses, d)` that returns the number of such pairs.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of coordinates and house heights?**
   - The coordinates (`xi`, `yi`) and heights (`hi`) can be any integer values (both positive and negative).

2. **How should we handle floating-point arithmetic for distance?**
   - Ensure the calculations are precise up to a reasonable number of decimal places when computing the Euclidean distance.

3. **Can there be multiple houses located at the same coordinates with the same height?**
   - It is not specified, but let's assume each house location with height is unique to simplify the problem.

4. **Do we consider the order of pairs (i, j) and (j, i) as distinct?**
   - No, (i, j) and (j, i) should be considered the same pair and should only be counted once.

## Strategy

1. **Euclidean Distance Calculation**: Use the Euclidean distance formula: \( \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2} \).
2. **Height Comparison**: Ensure both houses have the same height.
3. **Brute Force**: Iterate over all pairs of houses and check if they satisfy the given conditions.
4. **Precision Handling**: Since floating point operations can be imprecise, compare the squared distances to avoid square root calculations.

## Code

```java
import java.util.List;

public class CountHousesAtDistance {

    public static int countPairs(List<int[]> houses, double d) {
        int count = 0;
        int n = houses.size();
        double dSquared = d * d;  // Use squared distance to avoid precision issues
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                int[] house1 = houses.get(i);
                int[] house2 = houses.get(j);
                
                if (house1[2] == house2[2]) {  // Same height
                    int dx = house1[0] - house2[0];
                    int dy = house1[1] - house2[1];
                    double distanceSquared = dx * dx + dy * dy;
                    
                    if (Math.abs(distanceSquared - dSquared) < 1e-9) {  // Use a small threshold for precision
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        List<int[]> houses = List.of(new int[]{0, 0, 2}, new int[]{1, 1, 2}, new int[]{2, 2, 2});
        double d = Math.sqrt(2);  // Example distance
        System.out.println(countPairs(houses, d));  // Expected output based on input
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\) where \(n\) is the number of houses. This is due to the nested loop iterating through all pair combinations.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) as we are only using a fixed number of extra variables and the input list does not require additional space.

This solution iterates over each unique pair of houses, calculates the squared distance, and checks the height constraint. It ensures accuracy in floating-point operations by comparing against a small threshold.
