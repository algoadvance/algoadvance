[Leetcode 2680. Maximum OR](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2680)
### Problem Statement
You are given a list of non-negative integers. You can choose one integer from the list and perform a bitwise OR operation involving all other numbers in the list (leaving that chosen number out). Return the maximum value you can obtain from such an operation.

### Clarifying Questions
To ensure a clear understanding of the problem, let's clarify a few points:
1. **Input Size**: Is there a constraint on the input size (e.g., maximum length of the list)?
2. **Values Range**: Are there any constraints on the values of the integers in the list (e.g., maximum number of bits)?
3. **Performance Requirements**: Are there specific performance requirements we need to adhere to?

### Example
For the list `[1, 2, 4, 8]`:
- If you leave out `1`, the OR of `2, 4, 8` is `14`.
- If you leave out `2`, the OR of `1, 4, 8` is `13`.
- If you leave out `4`, the OR of `1, 2, 8` is `11`.
- If you leave out `8`, the OR of `1, 2, 4` is `7`.
The maximum result you can achieve is `14`.

### Strategy
1. **Understand Bitwise OR**: The bitwise OR operation results in a `1` in each bit position where there is at least one `1` in the corresponding positions of the operands.
2. **Complete OR Value**: Calculate the OR value of the entire list.
3. **Evaluate without Each Element**: For each element, compute the OR value of all other elements by taking the OR of the complete list and removing the contribution of the current element if necessary.
4. **Track Maximum**: Track the maximum OR value obtained by excluding each element one at a time.

### Time Complexity
- **Complete OR Calculation**: O(n), where n is the size of the list.
- **Evaluating OR without Each Element**: O(n). We do need to perform computation n-1 times, so overall it will still be O(n).

```java
public class MaximumOROut {
    public static int maximumOROutWithoutOneElement(int[] nums) {
        int completeOR = 0;
        
        // Calculate the OR of the entire list
        for (int num : nums) {
            completeOR |= num;
        }
        
        int maxOR = 0;
        
        // Calculate maximum OR by ignoring each element
        for (int num : nums) {
            int currentOR = completeOR & ~num;
            maxOR = Math.max(maxOR, currentOR);
        }
        
        return maxOR;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 4, 8};
        int maxOR = maximumOROutWithoutOneElement(nums);
        System.out.println("Maximum OR-out value: " + maxOR); //Output: 14
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Calculate the overall OR** of all numbers in the list.
2. For each number in the list, compute the OR value of the rest of the numbers by bitwise ANDing the complete OR with the bitwise complement of the element.
3. Track the maximum OR value obtained from these computations.

This approach ensures we only traverse the list a couple of times, yielding efficient O(n) complexity.
