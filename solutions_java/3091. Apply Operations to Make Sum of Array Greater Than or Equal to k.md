[Leetcode 3091. Apply Operations to Make Sum of Array Greater Than or Equal to k](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3091)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of non-negative integers `arr` and an integer `k`. In one operation, you can select any element of the array and double it (multiply it by 2). Your task is to find the minimum number of operations required to make the sum of the array greater than or equal to `k`.

If it is not possible to achieve this, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is it possible to have an empty array?**
   - No, the array should contain at least one element.
   
2. **What are the constraints on the elements of the array and `k`?**
   - Both the elements of the array and `k` are non-negative integers. Specific constraints might include the maximum values allowed for array elements and `k`, which can help determine feasible solutions.

3. **Can the array contain duplicate values?**
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicate values.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, the overall strategy is to:
1. Calculate the initial sum of the array.
2. If the sum is already greater than or equal to `k`, return 0.
3. Otherwise, identify the elements that can be doubled to increase the sum in the most effective way and decide the number of such operations.
4. Use a priority queue (max-heap) to always double the largest element available for a more significant impact on the total sum.
5. Track the number of operations required until the sum meets or exceeds `k`.

### Code

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public class OperationsToReachSum {

    public int minOperationsToReachSum(int[] arr, int k) {
        long currentSum = 0;
        for (int num : arr) {
            currentSum += num;
        }
        
        if (currentSum >= k) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b - a);
        for (int num : arr) {
            maxHeap.add(num);
        }

        int operations = 0;
        while (currentSum < k && !maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
            int maxElem = maxHeap.poll();
            currentSum += maxElem;
            if (currentSum >= k) {
                operations++;
                break;
            }

            maxElem *= 2;
            maxHeap.add(maxElem);
            operations++;
        }
        
        return currentSum >= k ? operations : -1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OperationsToReachSum solution = new OperationsToReachSum();
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 3};
        int k = 10;
        System.out.println(solution.minOperationsToReachSum(arr, k));  // Output: 3
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Heap Operations**: Each insertion and removal from the heap takes `O(log n)`.
2. **Main Loop**: Potentially runs up to `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the size of the array in the worst case scenarioâ€”each element might need to be doubled multiple times.

3. **Overall Complexity**: The main loop dominates the complexity, and hence the algorithm runs in `O(n log n log k)` because an element doubling can happen up to `log k` times, where `k` is the value we aim to reach.

This solution leveraging a max-heap ensures that each operation maximally contributes to reaching the target sum with the minimum number of operations.
