[Leetcode 1298. Maximum Candies You Can Get from Boxes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1298)
### Problem Statement

You are given `n` boxes, each with a certain number of candies. The boxes have two additional properties besides the number of candies: 1) a lock status, and 2) a list of keys to other boxes. You start with some initial set of boxes that are already opened (you can take the candies from them directly) and you strive to maximize the candies you can collect by opening as many boxes as possible (using the keys you acquire from the boxes you open).

Formally, you are given the following inputs:
- An array `status` where `status[i]` is `1` if the `i-th` box is open and `0` if the `i-th` box is closed.
- An array `candies` where `candies[i]` is the number of candies in the `i-th` box.
- A 2D array `keys` where `keys[i]` is a list of keys in the `i-th` box that can be used to open other boxes.
- A 2D array `containedBoxes` where `containedBoxes[i]` gives the list of boxes inside the `i-th` box.
- An array `initialBoxes` with the indices of the boxes you start with.

Your task is to return the maximum number of candies you can collect.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can boxes contain themselves or form a cycle?**
   - No, assume no boxes contain themselves directly or form a cycle of nested boxes.

2. **What happens if you have multiple keys for the same box?**
   - All keys for the same box will still only open the box once.

3. **Are there constraints on the size of the input arrays?**
   - The problem guarantees reasonable constraints typical of coding challenge problems, i.e., up to a few thousand boxes.

### Strategy

- **Initialization**: Prepare a queue to handle the boxes to be processed, starting with the `initialBoxes`.
- **Tracking openable boxes and keys**: Use a `boolean` array to track which boxes have been opened and add boxes that can be opened using collected keys.
- **Processing**: 
  - Process each box from the queue.
  - For each box, collect candies, add discovered keys to a list, and add contained boxes to the queue.
  - If a discovered key opens a box, add that box to the queue if it's not already opened.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MaximumCandies {
    public int maxCandies(int[] status, int[] candies, int[][] keys, int[][] containedBoxes, int[] initialBoxes) {
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        Set<Integer> reachableBoxes = new HashSet<>();
        boolean[] opened = new boolean[status.length];

        for (int box : initialBoxes) {
            reachableBoxes.add(box);
        }

        int totalCandies = 0;

        while (!reachableBoxes.isEmpty()) {
            boolean progress = false;
            List<Integer> toRemove = new ArrayList<>();

            for (int box : reachableBoxes) {
                if (status[box] == 1 && !opened[box]) {
                    progress = true;
                    opened[box] = true;
                    totalCandies += candies[box];

                    for (int key : keys[box]) {
                        status[key] = 1;  // Mark the box as openable.
                    }

                    for (int containedBox : containedBoxes[box]) {
                        reachableBoxes.add(containedBox);
                    }
                    toRemove.add(box);
                }
            }

            if (!progress) {
                break;
            }

            for (int box : toRemove) {
                reachableBoxes.remove(box);
            }
        }

        return totalCandies;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximumCandies mc = new MaximumCandies();

        int[] status = {1, 0, 1, 0};
        int[] candies = {7, 5, 4, 100};
        int[][] keys = // use example above
        int[][] containedBoxes = // use example above
        int[] initialBoxes = {0, 3};

        System.out.println(mc.maxCandies(status, candies, keys, containedBoxes, initialBoxes)); // Output: 16
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The solution processes each box and the operations inside each box are bounded by the sizes of the associated keys and containedBoxes arrays. Hence,
- The time complexity is **O(n + k + b)** where:
  - `n` is the total number of boxes.
  - `k` is the total number of keys across all boxes.
  - `b` is the total number of contained boxes across all boxes.

This approach ensures that we explore all reachable boxes and maximize the collection of candies.
