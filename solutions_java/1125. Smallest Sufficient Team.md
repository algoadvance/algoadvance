[Leetcode 1125. Smallest Sufficient Team](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1125)
Sure, let's go through the problem step by step.

### Problem Statement
You are given a list of `req_skills` and a list of `people`. The `ith` person in the list `people` contains a list of skills that this person has. Return any sufficient team of the smallest possible size, represented by the indices of the people in the list `people`.

A sufficient team is one where for every skill in `req_skills`, there is at least one person in the team who has that skill. It is guaranteed an answer exists.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can there be multiple people with the same skill?**
   Yes, multiple people can possess the same skill.
2. **What is the maximum size of `req_skills` and `people`?**
   The length of `req_skills` can be up to 16, and the length of `people` can be up to 60.
3. **Can a person have no skills?**
   Yes, a person can have no skills.

Understanding that, let's move on to the strategy.

### Strategy
We can use a bitmask dynamic programming approach to solve this problem efficiently:
1. **Bitmask Representation**: Each skill set can be represented as a bitmask integer. For example, if there are 5 required skills and a person has the first and third skills, it can be represented as `10100` (binary) which is `20` in decimal.
2. **Dynamic Programming**: Use a DP array where each index represents a combination of skills. The value at each index represents the smallest team that can achieve that combination of skills.

Steps:
1. Create an integer representation for each skill in `req_skills`.
2. Convert each person's skills list into a bitmask representation.
3. Iterate through each person and update the DP array to represent the smallest team possible for each combination of skills.

### Code
Let's dive into the code implementation.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class SmallestSufficientTeam {

    public int[] smallestSufficientTeam(String[] req_skills, List<List<String>> people) {
        int n = req_skills.length;
        int m = people.size();

        // Map each skill to an index
        Map<String, Integer> skillIndex = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            skillIndex.put(req_skills[i], i);
        }

        // Convert each person's skill list to a bitmask
        int[] peopleSkills = new int[m];
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            int skillMask = 0;
            for (String skill : people.get(i)) {
                if (skillIndex.containsKey(skill)) {
                    skillMask |= (1 << skillIndex.get(skill));
                }
            }
            peopleSkills[i] = skillMask;
        }

        // DP array to track the smallest team for each skill combination
        List<Integer>[] dp = new List[1 << n];
        dp[0] = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            int newSkillSet = peopleSkills[i];
            if (newSkillSet == 0) continue;  // Skip people with no relevant skills

            for (int j = 0; j < (1 << n); j++) {
                if (dp[j] == null) continue;
                
                int combinedSkillSet = j | newSkillSet;
                if (dp[combinedSkillSet] == null || dp[j].size() + 1 < dp[combinedSkillSet].size()) {
                    dp[combinedSkillSet] = new ArrayList<>(dp[j]);
                    dp[combinedSkillSet].add(i);
                }
            }
        }

        // The answer is in the combination that includes all skills (bitmask of all 1s of length n)
        return dp[(1 << n) - 1].stream().mapToInt(i -> i).toArray();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SmallestSufficientTeam solution = new SmallestSufficientTeam();

        String[] req_skills = {"java", "nodejs", "reactjs"};
        List<List<String>> people = Arrays.asList(
                Arrays.asList("java"),
                Arrays.asList("nodejs"),
                Arrays.asList("nodejs", "reactjs")
        );

        int[] result = solution.smallestSufficientTeam(req_skills, people);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(result)); // Print the indices of the smallest team
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(m * (2^n))` where:
- `n` is the number of required skills (`req_skills.length`).
- `m` is the number of people (`people.size()`).
In the worst case, the combination of different skills can result in up to `2^n` different skill sets, and we iterate over each person for each combination, thus the `O(m * (2^n))` complexity.

This complexity is feasible given the constraint that `n` can be at most 16, which makes `2^n` equals to 65536 manageable.
