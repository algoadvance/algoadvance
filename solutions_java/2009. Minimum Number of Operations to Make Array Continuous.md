[Leetcode 2009. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Continuous](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2009)
### Problem Statement
2009. Minimum Number of Operations to Make Array Continuous

Let's define an array `arr` as continuous if and only if we can sort the array such that each pair of adjacent elements increased by exactly 1. Given an integer array `nums`, return the minimum number of operations required to make `nums` continuous. In one operation, you can replace any element in `nums` with any integer value.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the array have duplicate elements?**
   - Yes, the array can have duplicates, as there’s no specification that the array must contain distinct integers.
   
2. **Is there a constraint on the size of the array?**
   - The typical constraints need to be assumed or inferred, but generally, the size of the array \( n \) is within the range permissible by standard problem constraints in competitive programming.

3. **What is the range of integers in the array?**
   - In standard competitive programming constraints, the integers range between typical minimum and maximum integer values in Java, which are -2³¹ to 2³¹-1.

### Strategy
To solve the problem, we need to:
1. Remove duplicates from `nums` to ensure we are dealing with unique values.
2. Sort the unique values.
3. Use a sliding window approach to find the longest subsequence of `nums` that can be made continuous by changing a minimal number of values. 

The length of this subsequence subtracted from the total length of `nums` will give the minimum number of operations required.

### Steps:
1. **Remove Duplicates**: Convert the array to a Set to remove duplicates and then back to a list.
2. **Sort the List**: Sort the unique elements to apply the sliding window.
3. **Sliding Window for Continuity**: Use a sliding window to find the length of the maximum sequence that can be made continuous.
4. **Calculate Minimum Operations**: The minimum number of operations required will be the difference between the length of the original array and the longest subsequence length found.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int[] nums) {
        Set<Integer> uniqueSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            uniqueSet.add(num);
        }

        List<Integer> uniqueList = new ArrayList<>(uniqueSet);
        Collections.sort(uniqueList);

        int n = nums.length;
        int maxLength = 0;
        int left = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < uniqueList.size(); right++) {
            while (uniqueList.get(right) - uniqueList.get(left) >= n) {
                left++;
            }
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
        }

        return n - maxLength;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {4,2,5,3};
        System.out.println(solution.minOperations(nums));  // Output: 0
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Removing Duplicates and Sorting**: \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array, for sorting the unique elements.
- **Sliding Window Processing**: \(O(n)\) since each element is processed at most twice (once added and once removed from the window).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

### Explanation
- The key portion is ensuring that we deduplicate the array and sort it once.
- We then use a sliding window to maintain the largest subset of the array where each element is continuous from each other.
- We return the difference in the original array length and the maximal sliding window to know the minimum operations required.

This strategy ensures we achieve the optimal solution within reasonable time complexity constraints.
