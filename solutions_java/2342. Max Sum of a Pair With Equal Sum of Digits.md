[Leetcode 2342. Max Sum of a Pair With Equal Sum of Digits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2342)
Sure, let's go through a detailed solution for the problem "Max Sum of a Pair With Equal Sum of Digits".

### Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` of positive integers, find the maximum sum of a pair of numbers (nums[i], nums[j]) such that the sum of the digits of nums[i] is equal to the sum of the digits of nums[j] and `i != j`. If no such pairs exist, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What should be returned if there are multiple pairs with the same maximum sum?
   - We only need to return the maximum sum value itself.
2. What is the range of the values of the integers in the array?
   - Usually, LeetCode problems will fit within typical integer ranges.
3. Can `nums` contain duplicates?
   - Yes, duplicates are allowed within the array.

### Strategy
1. **Digit Sum Calculation**: Write a helper function to calculate the sum of digits of a number.
2. **Map Creation**: Use a HashMap to store lists of numbers that have the same sum of their digits.
3. **Iterate and Compare**: Iterate through the lists in the map to find the maximum pair sum for each digit sum.

### Code
```java
import java.util.*;

public class MaxSumPairWithEqualSumOfDigits {
    
    public static int maximumSum(int[] nums) {
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> digitSumMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Helper function to calculate the sum of digits
        for (int num : nums) {
            int digitSum = getSumOfDigits(num);
            digitSumMap.putIfAbsent(digitSum, new ArrayList<>());
            digitSumMap.get(digitSum).add(num);
        }
        
        int maxSum = -1;
        
        // Iterate through the map and find the maximum sum of pairs
        for (List<Integer> list : digitSumMap.values()) {
            if (list.size() > 1) {
                // Sort the list in descending order
                Collections.sort(list, Collections.reverseOrder());
                // Get the sum of the largest two numbers in the list
                int currentSum = list.get(0) + list.get(1);
                maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);
            }
        }
        return maxSum;
    }
    
    private static int getSumOfDigits(int num) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            sum += num % 10;
            num /= 10;
        }
        return sum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {51, 71, 17, 42};
        System.out.println(maximumSum(nums));  // Output: 93
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is as follows:
- **Digit Sum Calculation**: Calculating the sum of digits for each number is O(D) where D is the number of digits in the number. Since we do this for each number in the array, the total time becomes O(N * D) where N is the length of the array.
- **Sorting the Lists**: Sorting each list of numbers with the same digit sum. In the worst case, if all numbers have the same digit sum, sorting will be O(N log N).
- **Overall Complexity**: Combining both parts, the overall time complexity is O(N * D + N log N).

This solution should be efficient enough given typical constraints in algorithm problems, where N might be up to 10^4 or 10^5. The auxiliary space required is O(N) due to the hash map.
