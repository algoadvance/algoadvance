[Leetcode 3225. Maximum Score From Grid Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3225)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `n x n` integer grid `grid`. You need to perform operations to maximize the score from the grid. The score is calculated by summing up the values of the cells that are not eliminated. You can eliminate a cell `(i, j)` if it is not considered an edge cell. An edge cell is one that lies on the border of the grid.

Your task is to find the maximum possible score you can obtain after performing the operations optimally.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What constitutes an "edge" cell?**
   - An edge cell is any cell that lies on the border of the grid (i.e., it belongs to the first row, last row, first column, or last column).

2. **Can we eliminate multiple cells in one operation, or is it one cell per operation?**
   - The problem statement doesnâ€™t specify, so let's assume each operation eliminates one cell and consider optimizing elimination to maximize remaining cells' sum.

3. **Are there any constraints on the size of the grid or the values it contains?**
   - Typically, such problems have constraints. Let's assume `n` is reasonably small for practical computations (e.g., `n <= 1000`) and values are integers within a reasonable range (e.g., `-10^4 <= grid[i][j] <= 10^4`).

4. **Do we need to eliminate cells at all, or can we return the sum of all cells as is?**
   - Ideally, we need to consider operations to maximize the score, which might involve strategic eliminations if non-edge cells contribute negatively to the overall score.

## Strategy

### Approach:

1. **Identify Edges:**
   - Directly identify and sum the value of edge cells.

2. **Eliminate Interior Cells:**
   - Evaluate the possible scenarios where eliminating interior cells (non-edge cells) could lead to maximizing the overall score.
   - This step includes considering eliminating the cells with highly negative values if they are non-edge.

3. **Sum Calculation:**
   - Calculate the sum of selected cells (after elimination if required).

### Implementation:
We will create a helper function to check whether a cell is an edge. We'll iterate through the grid to sum up the edge cells and add them to our maximum score calculation.

## Code

```java
public class MaximumScoreGrid {
    public int maxScoreFromGridOperations(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        int maxScore = 0;

        // Sum all edge cells
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (isEdge(i, j, n)) {
                    maxScore += grid[i][j];
                }
            }
        }

        // Consider eliminating negative interior cells
        for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n - 1; j++) {
                if (!isEdge(i, j, n) && grid[i][j] < 0) {
                    // If removing the negative cell increases score, remove it
                    maxScore += grid[i][j];
                }
            }
        }

        return maxScore;
    }

    private boolean isEdge(int i, int j, int n) {
        return i == 0 || i == n - 1 || j == 0 || j == n - 1;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximumScoreGrid obj = new MaximumScoreGrid();
        int[][] grid = {
            {1, -1, 2},
            {-1, -2, -3},
            {4, 5, -2}
        };
        System.out.println(obj.maxScoreFromGridOperations(grid));  // Should output the max score after optimally removing negative interior elements.
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Edge Detection:** O(n^2) - where `n` is the size of the grid. We iterate over all cells once.
- **Interior Cell Evaluation:** Also O(n^2) - again iterating through all cells once.
- **Overall Time Complexity:** O(n^2) - the sum of both operations, since they are performed sequentially.

This complexity is suitable for grids up to around `1000 x 1000`, given the constraints that typical LeetCode problems have.
