[Leetcode 1081. Smallest Subsequence of Distinct Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1081)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return the lexicographically smallest subsequence of `s` that contains all the distinct characters of `s` exactly once.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
     - The length of string `s` is â‰¤ 1000.
  
2. **Character Set:**
   - Does the string contain any special characters, or is it limited to lowercase English letters?
     - The string contains only lowercase English letters.

3. **Output Characteristics:**
   - Should the output maintain the order of characters as they appear in the dictionary?
     - Yes, the output should be lexicographically smallest.

### Strategy

1. **Stack Usage for Monotonically Increasing Sequence:**
   - Use a stack to keep track of the characters in the result sequence. Maintain it in a way that characters in the stack are in lexicographical order.

2. **Character Frequency:**
   - Use a frequency array to count the occurrences of each character.

3. **Set for Character Inclusion:**
   - Use a set to keep track of characters that are already included in the stack.

4. **Iterate Through String:**
   - For each character, check if it is already in the stack:
     - If it is not, use the stack to maintain the lexicographical order and also check the frequency array to ensure the characters removed can still be used later.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public String smallestSubsequence(String s) {
        int[] charFrequency = new int[26];
        boolean[] inStack = new boolean[26];
        Stack<Character> stack = new Stack<>();

        // Count the frequency of each character in the string
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            charFrequency[ch - 'a']++;
        }

        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            // Reduce the frequency count of the current character
            charFrequency[ch - 'a']--;

            // If character is already in stack, skip adding it
            if (inStack[ch - 'a']) {
                continue;
            }

            // Ensure the stack maintains the lexicographical order
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && stack.peek() > ch && charFrequency[stack.peek() - 'a'] > 0) {
                inStack[stack.pop() - 'a'] = false;
            }

            // Push the current character to the stack and mark it as included
            stack.push(ch);
            inStack[ch - 'a'] = true;
        }

        // Build the result string from the stack
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        for (char ch : stack) {
            result.append(ch);
        }

        return result.toString();
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. Each character is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
  
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for the stack that stores the characters of the subsequence, and `O(1)` for the fixed size arrays (`charFrequency` and `inStack`).

This approach efficiently finds the lexicographically smallest subsequence of distinct characters using a stack-based method to maintain order and uniqueness.
