[Leetcode 898. Bitwise ORs of Subarrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l898)
### Problem Statement
Given an array `arr` of integers, find the number of unique results from all possible bitwise OR operations of subarrays.

**Example:**
```
Input: arr = [1,1,2]
Output: 3
Explanation: The possible subarrays are [1], [1], [2], [1,1], [1,2], [1,1,2]. The results of these OR operations are:
1 = 1
1 = 1
2 = 2
1 | 1 = 1
1 | 2 = 3
1 | 1 | 2 = 3
There are 3 unique values, so the answer is 3.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the array be empty?** 
   No, the array will have at least one element.
2. **What are the constraints on the array size and element values?**
   The array length can be up to 50, and element values range from 0 to \(10^9\).

### Strategy
1. **Initialization:**
   Use two sets:
   - `cur`: To store the results of OR operations ending at the current index.
   - `res`: To store all unique OR results.

2. **Iteration:**
   For each element in the array, update the `cur` set to include results of OR operations combining the current element with all previous subarray results. Add all results to `res`.

3. **Updating ORs:**
   For each element `arr[i]`:
   - Initialize `new_cur` set with `arr[i]`.
   - For each element in the current `cur`, compute the OR operation with `arr[i]` and add to `new_cur`.
   - After processing `arr[i]`, set `cur` to `new_cur`.

4. **Unique Results:**
   Insert the results of `new_cur` into the `res` set.

5. **Final Result:**
   The size of the `res` set will be the number of unique OR results.

### Time Complexity
- **Worst-case scenario**: We could perform OR operations on a combination of subarrays, leading to \(O(n^2)\) OR operations where `n` is the length of the array. Given the constraints, this approach should be efficient.

### Code
```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class Solution {
    public int subarrayBitwiseORs(int[] arr) {
        Set<Integer> res = new HashSet<>();
        Set<Integer> cur = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (int num : arr) {
            Set<Integer> newCur = new HashSet<>();
            newCur.add(num);
            for (int x : cur) {
                newCur.add(num | x);
            }
            cur = newCur;
            res.addAll(cur);
        }
        
        return res.size();
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. We use two sets, `res` (to store all unique OR results) and `cur` (to store OR results ending with the current element).
2. For each element in the array, we calculate the new set of OR results by performing the OR operation between the current element and each element in the `cur` set from the previous iteration.
3. Update the `cur` set with these new OR results.
4. Add all results from `cur` to `res`.
5. Finally, return the size of the `res` set, which represents the number of unique OR results.

This approach ensures we efficiently track all unique results without redundant computations.
