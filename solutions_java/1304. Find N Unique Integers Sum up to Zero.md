[Leetcode 1304. Find N Unique Integers Sum up to Zero full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1304)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, return any array containing `n` unique integers such that they add up to zero.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can `n` be zero or negative?
   **A:** Based on typical problem constraints, `n` should be at least 1. Negative or zero wouldn't make sense in this context.
   
2. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the range of the integers in the array?
   **A:** No specific constraints on the range as long as they are integers.

3. **Q:** Should the output array be sorted?
   **A:** The problem doesn't specify sorting, so non-sorted arrays are acceptable as long as they meet the unique and sum-to-zero criteria.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we can leverage the properties of symmetric pairs around zero. Here’s the strategy step-by-step:

1. If `n` is even, we can pair positive and negative integers symmetrically, e.g. for `n=4`, use `[-2, -1, 1, 2]`.
2. If `n` is odd, we can do similar pairing but add a zero to ensure the sum is zero, e.g. for `n=5`, use `[-2, -1, 0, 1, 2]`.

We'll generate integers from `-(n//2)` to `n//2` and include zero if `n` is odd. This guarantees the integers are unique and sum to zero.

## Code

Here’s the implementation in Java:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] sumZero(int n) {
        int[] result = new int[n];
        int index = 0;
        
        // If n is odd, include zero in the result
        if (n % 2 == 1) {
            result[index++] = 0;
        }
        
        int halfN = n / 2;
        for (int i = 1; i <= halfN; i++) {
            result[index++] = i;
            result[index++] = -i;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of integers in the array. We are simply iterating `n` times to fill the array, thus making the approach linear in complexity.
