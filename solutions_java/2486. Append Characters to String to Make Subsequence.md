[Leetcode 2486. Append Characters to String to Make Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2486)
## Problem Statement
Given two strings `s` and `t`, you are tasked with determining the minimum number of characters that need to be appended to the end of `s` to make `t` a subsequence of `s`.

A sequence `t` is a subsequence of `s` if it can be derived from `s` by deleting some characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input strings `s` and `t` be empty?
2. Are there any constraints on the lengths of `s` and `t`?
3. Are the characters in both strings limited to lowercase English letters only?

## Code
Before writing the code, let's discuss the strategy.

## Strategy
1. We need to iterate through both strings, `s` and `t`.
2. We will keep a pointer for each string.
3. Starting from the beginning of both strings, we will move the pointer on `s` whenever we find a matching character for the current character in `t`.
4. When there is no match, simply move the pointer of `s`.
5. The pointer moving on `t` will tell us how many characters of `t` have been matched so far.
6. At the end, if the pointer on `t` (say `j`) is not equal to the length of `t`, it means we need to append the remaining characters of `t` from position `j` to the end.

## Code

Here is the Java implementation of the strategy discussed:

```java
public class AppendCharacters {
    public int appendCharacters(String s, String t) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        
        while (i < s.length() && j < t.length()) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == t.charAt(j)) {
                j++; // move t's pointer if there's a match in s
            }
            i++; // always move s's pointer
        }
        
        // If t is fully matched, j will be equal to t.length()
        // Otherwise, the remaining characters in t need to be appended
        return t.length() - j;
    }
}
```
## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n + m)** where `n` is the length of `s` and `m` is the length of `t`, as we may need to iterate through both strings completely.

- The space complexity is **O(1)** as we are using only a few integer variables to keep track of the indices.

By following the above approach, we can determine the minimum number of characters needed to be appended to `s` to make `t` a subsequence of `s`.
