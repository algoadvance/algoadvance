[Leetcode 1072. Flip Columns For Maximum Number of Equal Rows](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1072)
### Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` binary matrix `matrix`, you can choose any number of columns in the matrix and flip every cell in that column (i.e., change `0` to `1` or `1` to `0`).

Return the maximum number of rows with all values equal after some number of flips.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What qualifies as an equal row?**
   - A row is considered equal if all its elements are either all `0`s or all `1`s.

2. **Can we assume all input matrices are binary and valid?**
   - Yes, the input is specified to be a binary matrix with values either `0` or `1`.

3. **What is the range of values for `m` and `n` (dimensions of the matrix)?**
   - This is typically within the constraints of 1 <= m, n <= 300. 

4. **Is there any constraint on the number of flips?**
   - No, there's no constraint on the number of flips as long as they help achieve the desired outcome.

### Strategy

- To maximize the number of equal rows after flips, observe that flipping any column in the matrix can turn a `0` to `1` or vice versa.
- For each row, determine its "normalized" form, which is either itself or its complement (flipped across all bits).
- Use a hash map to count how many times each "normalized" form appears. The "normalized" form of a row can be found by ensuring its first element is a `0`, and then, we look at how often each normalized form appears and return the maximum count.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public int maxEqualRowsAfterFlips(int[][] matrix) {
        HashMap<String, Integer> patternCount = new HashMap<>();
        int maxEqualRows = 0;

        for (int[] row : matrix) {
            StringBuilder pattern = new StringBuilder();
            StringBuilder invertedPattern = new StringBuilder();
            
            for (int num : row) {
                pattern.append(num);
                invertedPattern.append(num ^ 1);
            }
            
            String normalPattern = pattern.toString();
            String complementPattern = invertedPattern.toString();
            
            // Increment the count of each pattern
            patternCount.put(normalPattern, patternCount.getOrDefault(normalPattern, 0) + 1);
            patternCount.put(complementPattern, patternCount.getOrDefault(complementPattern, 0) + 1);
            
            // Update the maximum equal rows count
            maxEqualRows = Math.max(maxEqualRows, Math.max(patternCount.get(normalPattern), patternCount.get(complementPattern)));
        }

        return maxEqualRows;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Constructing patterns:** For each row, constructing the pattern and its complement takes O(n) time, where n is the number of columns.
- **Inserting in the hash map:** Each row insertion/update in the HashMap is O(1) on average.
- **Total Complexity:** Given `m` rows, the total time complexity is O(m * n).

Hence, the overall time complexity is O(m * n).

### Explanation
1. **Pattern Creation:** For each row, create two patterns:
   - The direct string of row elements.
   - Its complement by flipping each bit.
   
2. **Hash Map Usage:** Use a hash map to track the frequency of each pattern.
   
3. **Count Maximum Frequency:** For each row, update the count and track the highest frequency pattern (whether itâ€™s the direct or the complement pattern).

This allows us to determine the maximum number of rows that can be made equal with optimal column flips.
