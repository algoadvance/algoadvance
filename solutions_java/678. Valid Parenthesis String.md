[Leetcode 678. Valid Parenthesis String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l678)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` containing only three types of characters: '(', ')' and '*', return `true` if `s` is valid.

The string is considered valid if:
1. Any left parenthesis `'('` must have a corresponding right parenthesis `')'`.
2. Any right parenthesis `')'` must have a corresponding left parenthesis `'('`.
3. Left parenthesis `'('` must go before the corresponding right parenthesis `')'`.
4. `'*'` could be treated as a single right parenthesis `')'` or a single left parenthesis `'('` or an empty string.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Can the input string be empty?
   - **A**: Yes, if the input string is empty, it is considered valid.

2. **Q**: What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
   - **A**: The length of the string `s` will be in the range `[1, 100]`.

3. **Q**: Can the string contain characters other than '(', ')' or '*'?
   - **A**: No, the string will only contain the characters '(', ')' and '*'.

## Strategy

To determine if the string `s` is valid, we can use a greedy approach. Hereâ€™s a concise plan:

1. We maintain two counters, `low` and `high`, representing the possible range of open parentheses.
2. As we iterate through the string:
   - If we encounter '(', we increment both `low` and `high`.
   - If we encounter ')', we decrement both `low` and `high`.
   - If we encounter '*', we decrement `low` (considering it as a ')' to keep the minimum open parentheses as small as possible) and increment `high` (considering it as a '(' to maximize the possibility).
3. After iterating through the string, if `low` is greater than 0, it means there are unmatched open parentheses which cannot be made up by any `*`. Hence, return `false`.
4. If `high` is non-negative, then it means we managed to balance out the parentheses, thus return `true`.

This logic ensures that at any point, the number of open parentheses is adjusted keeping the worst scenario in mind using the minimum and maximum bounds (`low` and `high`).

## Code

```java
public class ValidParenthesisString {
    public boolean checkValidString(String s) {
        int low = 0;
        int high = 0;
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '(') {
                low++;
                high++;
            } else if (c == ')') {
                if (low > 0) low--;
                high--;
            } else { // case '*'
                if (low > 0) low--;
                high++;
            }
            if (high < 0) return false; // more ')' than '(' or '*'
        }
        return low == 0;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we process each character in the string exactly once.

The space complexity is **O(1)** since we only use a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size (specifically, we use two integer variables).
