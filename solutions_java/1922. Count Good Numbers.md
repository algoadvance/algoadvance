[Leetcode 1922. Count Good Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1922)
### Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer `n`.

A positive integer is called good if its decimal representation (without leading zeros) follows the rules below:

1. Its number of digits is equal to `n`.
2. The positions with odd indices (1-based) are even digits.
3. The positions with even indices (1-based) are prime digits (2, 3, 5, or 7).

Return the number of good integers of length `n`. As the answer may be large, return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Clarification on indexing**: When referring to odd and even indices, we are assuming 1-based indexing correct?
   - Yes, 1-based indexing.

2. **What is the value range of `n`**?
   - The constraints will usually be such that `n` is a large positive integer. Common constraints may have it around `10^5` or higher.

3. **Output Format and Values**: Should we return the number of good integers modulo \(10^9 + 7\)?
   - Yes, the number of good integers modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Strategy

1. **Count of Positions**:
   - Odd positions (1-based): Even digits \([0, 2, 4, 6, 8]\). There are 5 possible choices.
   - Even positions (1-based): Prime digits \([2, 3, 5, 7]\). There are 4 possible choices.

2. **Forming Good Numbers**:
   - For each odd position index, you have 5 choices (0, 2, 4, 6, 8).
   - For each even position index, you have 4 choices (2, 3, 5, 7).

   When `n` is even:
   - Half the positions will be odd (say `m` odd positions) and half will be even (say `m` even positions).
   
   When `n` is odd:
   - `n/2 + 1` positions will be odd, and `n/2` positions will be even.

3. **Mathematical Formulation**:
   - Number of odd positions (`odd_count`): \((n + 1) / 2\)
   - Number of even positions (`even_count`): \(n / 2\)
   - Total number of good numbers = \( (5^{\text{odd_count}}) \times (4^{\text{even_count}}) \mod 10^9 + 7\)

4. **Modular Exponentiation**:
   - Calculate \(5^{\text{odd_count}}\) and \(4^{\text{even_count}}\) using modular exponentiation to handle large powers efficiently.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    private static final int MOD = 1000000007;

    public int countGoodNumbers(long n) {
        long oddCount = (n + 1) / 2;
        long evenCount = n / 2;
        long oddPower = modularExponentiation(5, oddCount, MOD);
        long evenPower = modularExponentiation(4, evenCount, MOD);
        return (int) (oddPower * evenPower % MOD);
    }

    private long modularExponentiation(long base, long exp, int mod) {
        long result = 1;
        base = base % mod;
        while (exp > 0) {
            if ((exp & 1) == 1) {
                result = (result * base) % mod;
            }
            exp >>= 1;
            base = (base * base) % mod;
        }
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        // Use test cases to validate solution
        System.out.println(sol.countGoodNumbers(50));  // Example test case
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity for modular exponentiation is \(O(\log n)\).
- Since we are computing modular exponentiation for `n/2` and `n/2 + 1` counts, the overall complexity remains \(O(\log n)\). 

This is efficient and feasible given the constraints usually associated with such problems.
