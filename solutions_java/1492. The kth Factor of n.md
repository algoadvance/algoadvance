[Leetcode 1492. The kth Factor of n](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1492)
## Problem Statement

Given two positive integers `n` and `k`, return the `kth` factor of `n`. If there are fewer than `k` factors, return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of values:** What are the expected ranges for `n` and `k`?
   - Typically, for competitive programming problems, we can assume `1 <= n <= 1000` and `1 <= k <= 1000`.

2. **Output for `k > total number of factors`:** As per the problem description, we return `-1` if there are fewer than `k` factors.

3. **Factors Counting:** Are factors sorted in ascending order by default?
   - Yes, factors should be considered in ascending order naturally.

4. **Multiple calls:** Is it a single-shot function call or part of a broader system where efficiency matters?
   - Assuming it's a single call, but we'll aim for an efficient solution regardless.

## Strategy

To find the `kth` factor of `n`:
1. Iterate through numbers from 1 to `n`.
2. Check if a number is a factor of `n` (i.e., `n % i == 0`).
3. Maintain a counter to count the factors.
4. When the counter reaches `k`, return the corresponding factor.
5. If the loop completes without finding `k` factors, return `-1`.

This approach ensures we traverse the minimum necessary range while keeping the solution straightforward.

## Code

```java
public class KthFactor {
    public int kthFactor(int n, int k) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (n % i == 0) {
                count++;
                if (count == k) {
                    return i;
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        KthFactor finder = new KthFactor();
        // Test cases:
        System.out.println(finder.kthFactor(12, 3)); // Output: 3
        System.out.println(finder.kthFactor(7, 1));  // Output: 1
        System.out.println(finder.kthFactor(4, 4));  // Output: -1
        System.out.println(finder.kthFactor(1, 1));  // Output: 1
        System.out.println(finder.kthFactor(1000, 10)); // Output: 25
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
  - We loop from 1 to `n` to find the factors.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`
  - Only a few constant extra space variables are used (`count`, `i`).

This solution efficiently finds the `kth` factor of `n` by leveraging straightforward iteration and modulus operations.
