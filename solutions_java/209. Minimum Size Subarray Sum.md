[Leetcode 209. Minimum Size Subarray Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l209)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of positive integers `nums` and a positive integer `target`, return the minimal length of a contiguous subarray `[nums[l], nums[l+1], ..., nums[r-1]]` of which the sum is greater than or equal to `target`. If there is no such subarray, return `0` instead.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are all elements in the array positive integers?**
   - Yes, all elements are positive integers.
2. **Can the array have duplicate elements?**
   - Yes, the array can have duplicate elements.
3. **Is the target always a positive integer?**
   - Yes, the target is always a positive integer.
4. **What are the constraints on the size of the array?**
   - The length of the array (`n`) can be up to `10^5` and the value of each element in the array can be up to `10^4`.

### Strategy
We can solve this problem using the sliding window (or two-pointer) technique:

1. **Initialize Two Pointers:** Start with two pointers, `left` and `right`, both at the beginning of the array.
2. **Move the Right Pointer:** Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer to the right and adding the elements to `current_sum` until `current_sum` becomes greater than or equal to `target`.
3. **Move the Left Pointer:** When `current_sum` is greater than or equal to `target`, move the `left` pointer to the right to shrink the window. After each move, update the minimum length of the subarray and subtract the element at `left` from `current_sum`.
4. **Repeat** until the `right` pointer reaches the end of the array.
5. **Edge Case:** If no valid subarray is found, return `0`.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int minSubArrayLen(int target, int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int left = 0;
        int currentSum = 0;
        int minLength = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            currentSum += nums[right];

            while (currentSum >= target) {
                minLength = Math.min(minLength, right - left + 1);
                currentSum -= nums[left];
                left++;
            }
        }

        return (minLength == Integer.MAX_VALUE) ? 0 : minLength;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array. Each element is processed at most twice (once by `right` pointer and once by `left` pointer).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), no extra space other than a few integer variables is used.

This sliding window approach is efficient and suitable for the input constraints given in the problem.
