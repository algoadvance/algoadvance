[Leetcode 3158. Find the XOR of Numbers Which Appear Twice](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3158)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` where every element appears exactly twice except for one element which appears once, find the XOR of all elements that appear exactly twice.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can we assume that the input array `nums` is non-empty?
   **A:** Yes, you can assume that the input array `nums` is non-empty.

2. **Q:** Should we consider the case where there are no numbers that appear exactly twice?
   **A:** No, the problem guarantees that every element appears exactly twice except for one element which appears once.

3. **Q:** Can the input array contain negative numbers?
   **A:** Yes, the input array can contain negative numbers as well as positive numbers.

### Strategy

1. **Using HashMap:**
   - Use a HashMap to count the frequency of each element.
   - Iterate through the array and count occurrences of each number.
   - Then iterate through the HashMap to find elements with frequency exactly equal to 2.
   - XOR the elements which have the frequency equal to 2.

This method efficiently finds the numbers that appear twice and calculates their XOR.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class FindXOROfNumbersAppearTwice {

    public static int findXorOfDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Count the frequency of each number
        for (int num : nums) {
            frequencyMap.put(num, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        int result = 0;
        
        // Calculate the XOR for numbers that appear exactly twice
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : frequencyMap.entrySet()) {
            if (entry.getValue() == 2) {
                result ^= entry.getKey();
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {4, 3, 7, 3, 7, 4, 8};
        System.out.println(findXorOfDuplicates(nums)); // Output should be 0 since 4 and 3 appear twice
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**
  - The time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of elements in `nums`. This is because we are making two passes through the array: one for counting the occurrences and another for finding the XOR of the elements appearing twice.
  
- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case due to the extra space used by the HashMap to store the frequency of each element in the array.
