[Leetcode 936. Stamping The Sequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l936)
### Problem Statement
Given a sequence `target` and a stamp `stamp`, we need to stamp `stamp` on `target` repeatedly until the target string becomes all `?` characters. Each turn we can place the stamp on the target string such that their characters match the sequence of characters already in the target and then change those characters in the target string to `?` for each matched part. We must return the sequence of the indices of the `target` where the `stamp` is placed. If we cannot get the `target` to all `?` characters, we should return an empty list.

### Problem Details
- `target` and `stamp` are non-empty strings with only lowercase English letters.
- The length of `stamp` will be between 1 and `target.length()` inclusive.

### Clarifying Questions
Before we jump into the solution, here are a few clarifying questions:
1. **Are there any constraints on the length of `target` and `stamp`?**
    - Not explicitly mentioned, but we can assume typical constraints for such problems, probably within thousands of characters.
2. **Should we consider overlapping regions for stamping?**
    - Yes, overlapping stamping is allowed and typically necessary.
3. **Can the stamp be placed such that it partially overlaps with `?` characters?**
    - Yes, as long as the non-`?` characters match the corresponding characters in the `stamp`.

### Strategy
1. **Pattern Matching:** We will look for places in the `target` where the `stamp` can be applied. This means finding substrings that match the `stamp` or could match if a subset of its characters are replaced with `?`.
2. **Process Repeatedly:** Keep applying the stamp where possible until no more stamps can be applied.
3. **Reverse Order:** It's often easier to think of constructing the result in reverse order to handle overlaps easily. Thus, we record the positions where we successfully stamp and then reverse them before returning.
4. **Stopping Condition:** We stop when no further stamping can be done in a full iteration over `target`.

### Code

Here's the solution coded in Java:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public int[] movesToStamp(String stamp, String target) {
        char[] sc = stamp.toCharArray();
        char[] tc = target.toCharArray();
        int sLen = sc.length;
        int tLen = tc.length;
        List<Integer> res = new ArrayList<>();
        
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[tLen];
        int stars = 0;
        
        while (stars < tLen) {
            boolean stamped = false;
            for (int i = 0; i <= tLen - sLen; i++) {
                if (!visited[i] && canStamp(tc, i, sc)) {
                    stars += doStamp(tc, i, sLen);
                    visited[i] = true;
                    stamped = true;
                    res.add(i);
                    
                    if (stars == tLen) break;
                }
            }
            if (!stamped) return new int[0];
        }
        
        Collections.reverse(res);
        return res.stream().mapToInt(i -> i).toArray();
    }
    
    private boolean canStamp(char[] tc, int pos, char[] sc) {
        for (int i = 0; i < sc.length; i++) {
            if (tc[i + pos] != '?' && tc[i + pos] != sc[i]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    private int doStamp(char[] tc, int pos, int len) {
        int stamped = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
            if (tc[pos + i] != '?') {
                tc[pos + i] = '?';
                stamped++;
            }
        }
        return stamped;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] result = sol.movesToStamp("abc", "ababc");
        for (int i : result) {
            System.out.print(i + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(N * (N - M)), where N is the length of `target` and M is the length of `stamp`. This is because, in the worst case, we process each potential stamping window up to N-M times, and each check and stamping operation itself takes up to O(M) time.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N) for additional structures to store visited flags and results.

In conclusion, the algorithm efficiently stamps the `target` until it is transformed to all `?` characters, while keeping track of the indices where the stamps were placed. The steps are logically structured to facilitate understanding and implementation.
