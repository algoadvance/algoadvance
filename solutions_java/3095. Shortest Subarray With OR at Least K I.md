[Leetcode 3095. Shortest Subarray With OR at Least K I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3095)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of non-negative integers `nums` and an integer `K`, you need to find the shortest subarray with a bitwise OR sum of at least `K`. If there isn't one, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are the numbers in the array guaranteed to be non-negative?
   - **A:** Yes, as specified.
2. **Q:** Can the array be empty?
   - **A:** Yes, it's possible.
3. **Q:** Is the value of K guaranteed to be non-negative?
   - **A:** Yes, it's guaranteed to be non-negative.
4. **Q:** Could `K` be greater than the sum of the bitwise OR of the entire array?
   - **A:** Yes, it could be.

### Strategy

1. **Sliding Window Technique:**
   - A potential strategy involves using a sliding window to maintain the subarray and compute the bitwise OR in a dynamic fashion.

2. **Initialization:**
   - Start both left and right pointers of the window at the beginning of the array.
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the current OR value of the window.

3. **Expansion and Contraction:**
   - Expand the right pointer to include more elements into the window and update the OR value.
   - Contract the left pointer if the OR value meets or exceeds `K` to potentially find a shorter subarray.

4. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - Check immediately if the array is empty or if no subarray can meet the condition.

5. **Tracking Shortest Subarray:**
   - Track the length of the shortest subarray that meets the criteria and update it during the contraction phase.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int shortestSubarrayWithORAtLeastK(int[] nums, int K) {
        // Edge case
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) return -1;
        
        int n = nums.length;
        int minLength = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int currentOR = 0;
        int left = 0;

        // Iterate over the array with the right pointer
        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            currentOR |= nums[right];

            // Contract the window while the condition is met
            while (left <= right && currentOR >= K) {
                minLength = Math.min(minLength, right - left + 1);
                currentOR &= ~nums[left];
                left++;
            }
        }

        return minLength == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : minLength;
    }
}

// Example usage
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int K = 6;
        System.out.println("Shortest subarray length: " + solution.shortestSubarrayWithORAtLeastK(nums, K)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - Each element is processed at most twice â€” once by the right pointer and at most once by the left pointer.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - A constant amount of extra space is used regardless of the input size.
  
This solution iteratively adjusts a sliding window over the array and dynamically maintains the bitwise OR, making it efficient and effective for the problem at hand.
