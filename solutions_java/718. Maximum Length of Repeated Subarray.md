[Leetcode 718. Maximum Length of Repeated Subarray](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l718)
### Problem Statement
You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`. Find the length of the maximum length subarray that appears in both arrays.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the size limits of `nums1` and `nums2`?
   - What is the range of values for the integers in the arrays?
   
   **Constraints:**
   - `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000`
   - `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 100`
   
2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should be returned if there are no common subarrays between the two arrays?

   **Answer:** Return `0`.

### Strategy
To solve the problem, we'll use a dynamic programming (DP) approach. We can maintain a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest subarray ending at positions `i` in `nums1` and `j` in `nums2`.

#### Steps:
1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a 2D array `dp` with dimensions `(len1 + 1) x (len2 + 1)` and initialize all elements to `0`.

2. **DP Transitions:**
   - Iterate through each element of `nums1` (`i` from `1` to `len1`) and `nums2` (`j` from `1` to `len2`).
   - If `nums1[i-1]` equals `nums2[j-1]`, set `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`.
   - Keep track of the maximum value in the `dp` table, which will be the length of the longest common subarray.

3. **Result:**
   - The result will be the maximum value found in the DP table.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(len1 * len2)`, where `len1` and `len2` are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively. This is because we use nested loops to fill the DP table.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(len1 * len2)` for storing the DP table.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int findLength(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int len1 = nums1.length;
        int len2 = nums2.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[len1 + 1][len2 + 1]; // Create DP table
        
        int maxLength = 0; // To keep track of the maximum length of the common subarray
        
        // Fill the DP table
        for (int i = 1; i <= len1; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= len2; j++) {
                if (nums1[i - 1] == nums2[j - 1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1; // If elements match, increment length
                    maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, dp[i][j]); // Update maxLength
                }
            }
        }
        
        return maxLength; // Return the maximum length found
    }
}
```

With this solution, you should be able to determine the length of the maximum length subarray that appears in both input arrays.
