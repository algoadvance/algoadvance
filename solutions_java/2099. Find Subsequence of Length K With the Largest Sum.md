[Leetcode 2099. Find Subsequence of Length K With the Largest Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2099)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the subsequence of length `k` that has the largest sum. If there are multiple subsequences, return the one with the largest sum and smallest lexicographical order.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the input array `nums` contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the array can contain negative numbers.
2. **Is the order of elements in the output subsequence important?**
   - Yes, the output should maintain the original order of elements as they appear in `nums`.
3. **What are the constraints on the values of `k` and the length of `nums`?**
   - Typically, 1 <= k <= length of nums <= 1000 and -10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5.
4. **Is it guaranteed that a subsequence of length `k` always exists?**
   - Yes, since 1 <= k <= length of nums.

### Strategy
1. **Select Top k Elements**: Identify the `k` largest elements in the array.
2. **Maintain Order**: Once we have those `k` largest elements, traverse the array and select them in order as they appear.
3. **Handling Ties**: If multiple elements have the same value, ensure we maintain their order from the input to manage ties correctly.

### Code
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int[] maxSubsequence(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        
        // Step 1: Create an array of index and values from nums
        int[][] numWithIndex = new int[n][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            numWithIndex[i][0] = nums[i];
            numWithIndex[i][1] = i;
        }
        
        // Step 2: Sort the array based on values in descending order
        Arrays.sort(numWithIndex, (a, b) -> b[0] - a[0]);
        
        // Step 3: Collect the indices of the top k elements
        int[] indices = new int[k];
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            indices[i] = numWithIndex[i][1];
        }
        
        // Step 4: Sort the indices to maintain the order of appearance
        Arrays.sort(indices);
        
        // Step 5: Construct the result based on sorted indices
        int[] result = new int[k];
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            result[i] = nums[indices[i]];
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {3, 4, 3, 3};
        int k = 2;
        int[] result = sol.maxSubsequence(nums, k);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(result));  // Output: [4, 3]
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Step 1**: Create pairs of numbers and their indices from `nums`.
2. **Step 2**: Sort the pairs in descending order based on the number values.
3. **Step 3**: Extract the indices of the top `k` numbers.
4. **Step 4**: Sort these indices to restore the original relative order among the selected `k` elements.
5. **Step 5**: Finally, construct the resultant subsequence according to these sorted indices.

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting** in Step 2 and Step 4 is the most time-consuming part. Each sorting operation takes O(n log n).
- As we perform the sorting operations twice, the overall time complexity is O(n log n) + O(k log k).

Thus, the time complexity for the entire solution is **O(n log n)**, considering `k` is relatively small compared to `n`.
