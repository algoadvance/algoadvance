[Leetcode 633. Sum of Square Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l633)
### Problem Statement
Given a non-negative integer `c`, determine whether there are two integers `a` and `b` such that:

\[ a^2 + b^2 = c \]

Return `true` if there are such integers `a` and `b`, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Is `c` guaranteed to be a non-negative integer?
   - Is there a maximum value for `c`?

   **Answer:**
   - Yes, `c` is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.
   - In general Leetcode problems, the value for `c` usually fits within the range of a typical 32-bit signed integer.

2. **Output:**
   - The function should return a boolean `true` or `false`.

### Strategy
The problem can be approached using the two-pointer technique. Hereâ€™s the plan:

1. **Initialize Two Pointers:**
   - One pointer (`a`) starts at 0.
   - Another pointer (`b`) starts at the integer square root of `c` (i.e., the largest `b` such that `b^2 <= c`).

2. **Two Pointer Algorithm:**
   - Compute the sum of squares of the current `a` and `b` pointers.
   - If the sum equals `c`, return `true`.
   - If the sum is less than `c`, increment `a` to increase the sum.
   - If the sum is greater than `c`, decrement `b` to decrease the sum.
   - Continue this process until `a` surpasses `b`.

3. **Exit Condition:**
   - If `a` surpasses `b`, return `false`, because no such pair `(a, b)` was found.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean judgeSquareSum(int c) {
        int a = 0;
        int b = (int) Math.sqrt(c);
        
        while (a <= b) {
            int sum = a * a + b * b;
            if (sum == c) {
                return true;
            } else if (sum < c) {
                a++;
            } else {
                b--;
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization:** Calculating the integer square root takes \(O(\log c)\) using efficient methods.
- **Two-pointer loop:** The pointers `a` and `b` together will move from 0 to the square root of `c`, so the overall time complexity of this part is \(O(\sqrt{c})\).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(\sqrt{c})\), since the time complexity to find the square root is minimal compared to the two-pointer traversal. The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as we are using a constant amount of space.
