[Leetcode 1970. Last Day Where You Can Still Cross](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1970)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `cells` where `cell[i] = [rowi, coli]` indicates that each `cell[i]` initially becomes blocked on the ith day. A cell is "blocked" when it cannot be traveled through.

You need to find the last day where you can still travel fully from the top row to the bottom row. You can travel only up, down, left, and right, and you need to find a path that allows you to travel from any cell in the top row to any cell in the bottom row.

The matrix `cells` initially has all its cells empty (0's), and cells become blocked sequentially as the days progress.

**Example:**

```
Input: m = 3, n = 3, cells = [[1,2],[2,1],[3,3],[2,2],[1,1],[1,3],[2,3],[3,1],[3,2]]
Output: 3

Input: m = 2, n = 2, cells = [[1,1],[2,1],[1,2],[2,2]]
Output: 2
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= m, n <= 2 * 10^4`
- `1 <= cells.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `1 <= row_i <= m`
- `1 <= col_i <= n`
- All the values of `cells` are unique.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Is it guaranteed that there is at least one day when you can cross the grid?
2. Can the matrix be non-square, i.e., `m` not equal to `n`?
3. Can we use any data structure to facilitate our solution, or are there restrictions?
4. How are the rows and columns indexed in the matrix? Is it 1-based or 0-based?

## Strategy

We need to determine the last day when there is a path from any cell in the top row to any cell in the bottom row. This problem can be approached using a combination of breadth-first search (BFS) and a binary search technique.

Steps:

1. **Initialize a Matrix:** Start with an empty matrix with all cells initially marked as unblocked.
2. **Binary Search on Days:** Perform a binary search on the days to find the last possible day we can still cross from the top to the bottom.
3. **Flood Fill on Each Attempt:** On each midpoint of the binary search, utilize BFS to check if a path exists from any top row cell to any bottom row cell.
4. **Update the Matrix According to the Day:** Keep updating the matrix according to the days provided in the `cells` list.
5. **Check Feasibility**: Use BFS or DFS to check if a path exists from top to bottom.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class LastDayCross {
    private static final int[] DIRECTION_X = {-1, 1, 0, 0};
    private static final int[] DIRECTION_Y = {0, 0, -1, 1};

    public int latestDayToCross(int m, int n, int[][] cells) {
        int left = 1, right = cells.length;
        int result = 0;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            if (canCross(mid, m, n, cells)) {
                result = mid;
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }

    private boolean canCross(int days, int m, int n, int[][] cells) {
        boolean[][] grid = new boolean[m][n];

        for (int i = 0; i < days; i++) {
            grid[cells[i][0] - 1][cells[i][1] - 1] = true;
        }

        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (!grid[0][j]) {
                queue.offer(new int[]{0, j});
                grid[0][j] = true;
            }
        }

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] cell = queue.poll();
            int x = cell[0], y = cell[1];

            if (x == m - 1) {
                return true;
            }

            for (int d = 0; d < 4; d++) {
                int newX = x + DIRECTION_X[d];
                int newY = y + DIRECTION_Y[d];

                if (newX >= 0 && newX < m && newY >= 0 && newY < n && !grid[newX][newY]) {
                    grid[newX][newY] = true;
                    queue.offer(new int[]{newX, newY});
                }
            }
        }

        return false;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LastDayCross solver = new LastDayCross();
        int[][] cells1 = // use example from above
        System.out.println(solver.latestDayToCross(3, 3, cells1)); // Output: 3

        int[][] cells2 = // use example from above
        System.out.println(solver.latestDayToCross(2, 2, cells2)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Binary Search:** O(log k), where k is the number of days.
- **BFS for Checking Paths:** O(m * n) for each BFS call since we potentially visit each cell once.

Combining these, the overall time complexity is O((m * n) * log k), where `m` is the number of rows, `n` is the number of columns, and `k` is the total number of days to check. This is efficient given the constraints.
