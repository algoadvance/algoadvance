[Leetcode 964. Least Operators to Express Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l964)
### Problem Statement

Given `x` and `target`, you need to return the least number of operations needed to express the number `target` using only the number `x` and the four basic arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /). Notice that you can use parentheses to change the order of operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of `x` and `target`?**
    - `1 <= x <= 100`
    - `0 <= target <= 10^8`
   
2. **Can `target` be zero?**
    - Yes, if `target` is 0, then the result is immediately 0 since no operations are needed.

3. **Is there a limit on the number of operations we can perform?**
    - No limit is specified on the number of operations.

### Strategy

We'll use a Dynamic Programming (DP) approach to solve this problem. 

1. **Concepts to Leverage**:
    - The value `target` can be represented as a combination of powers of `x`, i.e., `x^0`, `x^1`, `x^2`, etc.
    - Depending on the remainder when `target` is divided by `x`, we can either round down or up to the nearest power of `x`.

2. **Recursive Function**:
    - Define a recursive function `dp(target)` to compute the minimum number of operations.
    - If `target` is 0, return 0.
    - If `target = x^k`, only `k` multiplications are needed: return `k`.
    - For arbitrary `target`:
        - Consider both `target` modulo `x` (which gives simplicity of if we can directly use down rounding or up rounding).

3. **State Transition**:
    - `dp(target)` would be based on:
        - `target // x`: Using the last `target % x` operations to reduce the number.
        - `(target + x - 1) // x`: Using operations to increase `target`.

4. **Memoization**:
    - Utilize a hashmap or array for memoization to store the results of subproblems.

### Code Implementation

Below is the Java implementation of the above strategy using a dynamic programming approach:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class LeastOperatorsToExpressNumber {
    private Map<Integer, Integer> memo = new HashMap<>();
    
    public int leastOpsExpressTarget(int x, int target) {
        memo.clear();
        return dp(x, target);
    }
    
    private int dp(int x, int target) {
        // Base case
        if (target == 0) return 0;
        if (target < x) return Math.min(2 * target - 1, 2 * (x - target)); // Direct situations
        
        // Check memo
        if (memo.containsKey(target)) return memo.get(target);
        
        long ops = Long.MAX_VALUE; 
        long base = x;
        int k = 0;
        
        // Find the greatest `k` with x^k <= target
        while (base <= target) {
            base *= x;
            k++;
        }
        
        base /= x; // base is x^(k-1)
        
        int res;
        // Case 1: use x^(k-1)
        res = dp(x, (int) (target - base)) + k;
        ops = Math.min(ops, res);
        
        // Case 2: use x^k
        if (base * x - target < target) { 
            res = dp(x, (int) (base * x - target)) + k + 1;
            ops = Math.min(ops, res);
        }
        
        memo.put(target, (int) ops);
        return (int) ops;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LeastOperatorsToExpressNumber solution = new LeastOperatorsToExpressNumber();
        System.out.println(solution.leastOpsExpressTarget(3, 19)); // Expected output: 5
        System.out.println(solution.leastOpsExpressTarget(5, 501)); // Expected output: 8
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is somewhat difficult to pin down exactly, but it is efficiently manageable within the problem constraints:

- **Average Case**: The recursion effectively handles sub-problems by breaking down `target` into smaller targets, and memoization ensures each sub-computation is done only once.
- **Worst Case**: The complexity may be viewed as roughly O(log(target)) due to the nature of dividing by `x` and considering powers of `x`.

This should be efficient for practical values of `target` up to `10^8`.
