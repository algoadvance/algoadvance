[Leetcode 2745. Construct the Longest New String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2745)
### Problem Statement

You are given a number of 'A', 'B', and 'AB' strings. Your task is to construct the longest possible new string that can be formed by concatenating exactly `numA` 'A' strings, `numB` 'B' strings, and `numAB` 'AB' strings. The length of the new string is the combined length of all its substrings.

The constraints are as follows:
- The length of an 'A' string is 1.
- The length of a 'B' string is 1.
- The length of an 'AB' string is 2.

You need to implement the function `longestString(int numA, int numB, int numAB)` that returns the length of the longest new string that can be formed.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **How should the strings be concatenated?**
   - There are no restrictions on how the strings should be concatenated. You can concatenate them in any order.

2. **Can any of the input numbers be zero?**
   - Yes, `numA`, `numB`, and `numAB` can be zero.

3. **Are negative inputs possible?**
   - No, the inputs will always be non-negative integers.

4. **Will there be a limit to the size of the input numbers?**
   - It is assumed that the input values will be within the constraints typically handled by standard primitive data types in Java.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can directly rely on the given counts of 'A', 'B', and 'AB' strings. The length of the longest string that can be constructed is straightforwardly calculated by summing up:
- The number of 'A' strings.
- The number of 'B' strings.
- Twice the number of 'AB' strings (since each 'AB' string contributes 2 to the total length).

### Code

Here's how you would implement it in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int longestString(int numA, int numB, int numAB) {
        // Calculate the length of the longest string
        int totalLength = numA + numB + (2 * numAB);
        return totalLength;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(1)\) as the solution involves only a few arithmetic operations.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) as no additional space other than a few variables is required.

This approach is efficient and leverages the given constraints to compute the result in constant time.
