[Leetcode 2562. Find the Array Concatenation Value](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2562)
### Problem Statement

You are given a `0`-indexed integer array `nums`. The concatenation of `nums` is defined as follows: 
- Take the first element of `nums` and concatenate it with the second element.
- Take the result and concatenate it with the third element, and so on until the entire array has been concatenated to form a single number.

Return the final concatenated value as an integer.


### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is there any limit on the size of `nums`?**
   - Typically, constraints will be given. If not mentioned, we should assume it can be large enough to consider the algorithm's efficiency.
 
2. **Can `nums` contain negative numbers or non-integer values?**
   - Typically, such problems will specify the type of elements. Assuming it's an integer array with only non-negative numbers based on standard practices.

3. **Is there a specific data type we should use for the concatenated result?**
   - Given that the task is about concatenation to form a single number, handling large integers should be considered, and Java's `BigInteger` might be used if values are exceptionally large.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Start with an empty string or result initialized to `0`.

2. **Iteratively concatenate:**
   - Loop through each element of the array.
   - Convert each element to a string and concatenate it to the result.
   - Convert the final concatenated string back to an integer.
   
3. **Return the result:**
   - The final concatenated value is converted to an integer (or a suitable format if it exceeds typical integer bounds).

### Code

Here is the Java implementation of the described strategy:

```java
import java.math.BigInteger;

public class Solution {
    public BigInteger findArrayConcatenationValue(int[] nums) {
        // Using StringBuilder for efficiency in concatenation
        StringBuilder concatenatedValue = new StringBuilder();
        
        // Loop through each number and concatenate
        for (int num : nums) {
            concatenatedValue.append(num);
        }
        
        // Convert the final concatenated string to BigInteger to handle large values
        BigInteger finalResult = new BigInteger(concatenatedValue.toString());
        
        return finalResult;
    }
}

```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the `nums` array because we loop through each element exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is `O(1)` for auxiliary space, but we need `O(n)` space to store the concatenated result as a string.

This ensures that the solution efficiently handles the concatenation part while managing potentially large numbers using `BigInteger`.
