[Leetcode 1124. Longest Well](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1124)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `hours` where `hours[i]` represents the number of hours an employee worked on the `i-th` day.

A day is considered a "tiring day" if and only if `hours[i] > 8`. A well-performing interval is an interval of days where the number of tiring days is strictly greater than the number of non-tiring days.

Return the length of the longest well-performing interval.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints on the input size?**
   - The input size could be large, so any solution should ideally operate in linear time or close to it.
   
2. **Valid range of `hours[i]`?**
   - Each element in the `hours` array is a non-negative integer.

3. **What if all the days are tiring or all are non-tiring?**
   - If all days are tiring, the entire span is the longest interval. If all are non-tiring, there is no well-performing interval, which would imply a result of 0.

4. **Return type?**
   - Return an integer representing the length of the longest well-performing interval.

### Strategy
We'll use a prefix sum array to keep track of a score that increases by 1 for every tiring day, and decreases by 1 for every non-tiring day. We then need to find the longest subarray where the score is positive.

1. **Initialize the Process:**
   - Convert the `hours` array into a score array where each hour less or equal to 8 gets a -1 and each hour greater than 8 gets a +1.
   
2. **Use a HashMap to Track the First Occurrences of Scores:**
   - Use a HashMap (`scoreIndexMap`) to record the first occurrence of each cumulative score. This helps in efficiently finding the longest interval where the score is positive.

3. **Iterate Over the `scoreArray`:**
   - Update the current cumulative score.
   - Check if the current cumulative score is positive, if so, update the max length using the current index.
   - Check if `current score - 1` exists in the `scoreIndexMap`. If it does, this would mean we have found a subarray that makes the interval well-performing.
   - Update the `scoreIndexMap` with the current cumulative score if it hasn't been recorded yet.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is **O(N)**, where N is the number of elements in `hours` array. This is because we make a single pass over the array to compute the cumulative scores and store the results in a hashmap.

### Code Implementation
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    
    public int longestWPI(int[] hours) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> scoreIndexMap = new HashMap<>();
        int maxLength = 0;
        int score = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < hours.length; i++) {
            score += (hours[i] > 8) ? 1 : -1;
            
            if (score > 0) {
                maxLength = i + 1;
            } else {
                // Check if there's a prefix with score - 1
                if (scoreIndexMap.containsKey(score - 1)) {
                    maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, i - scoreIndexMap.get(score - 1));
                }
                
                // Only add this score to the map if it's not already present
                if (!scoreIndexMap.containsKey(score)) {
                    scoreIndexMap.put(score, i);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return maxLength;
    }
}
```

This code will efficiently determine the length of the longest well-performing interval by processing the hours in a single pass and making use of a hash map to store the first occurrence of cumulative scores. This way, it can quickly check for subarrays that would form a well-performing interval.
