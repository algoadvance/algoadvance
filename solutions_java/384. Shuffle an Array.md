[Leetcode 384. Shuffle an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l384)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. You need to implement two functions:
- `shuffle()`: Returns a random shuffling of the array.
- `reset()`: Resets the array to its original configuration and returns it.

Implement the class `Solution`:

- `Solution(int[] nums)`: Initializes the object with the integer array nums.
- `int[] reset()`: Resets the array to its original configuration and returns it.
- `int[] shuffle()`: Returns a random shuffling of the array.

### Example:

```python
Input
["Solution", "shuffle", "reset", "shuffle"]
[[[1, 2, 3]], [], [], []]

Output
[null, [3, 1, 2], [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2]]

Explanation
Solution solution = new Solution([1, 2, 3]);
solution.shuffle();    // Shuffle the array [1, 2, 3] and return its result.
                       // Any permutation of [1, 2, 3] must be equally likely to be returned.
solution.reset();      // Resets the array back to its original configuration [1, 2, 3]. Return [1, 2, 3]
solution.shuffle();    // Returns the random shuffling of array [1, 2, 3].
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is there any constraint on the length of the array?**
   - No specific constraints mentioned, assume reasonable length as per usual competitive programming standards.
2. **Do we need to consider duplicates in the array?**
   - The prompt does not prevent duplicates, so handle it appropriately.

## Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Store the original array in a variable for the `reset()` method to use.
   - Use an array copy to ensure the original array is not modified during shuffling.

2. **Reset Function:**
   - Return the original array.

3. **Shuffle Function:**
   - Use the Fisher-Yates shuffle algorithm to ensure a uniform random shuffle.

The Fisher-Yates algorithm ensures O(n) time complexity for shuffling in a straightforward manner.

## Code

Here is the implementation in Java:

```java
import java.util.Random;

public class Solution {
    private int[] original;
    private int[] array;
    private Random rand;
    
    public Solution(int[] nums) {
        original = nums.clone();
        array = nums.clone();
        rand = new Random();
    }

    public int[] reset() {
        array = original.clone();
        return array;
    }

    public int[] shuffle() {
        for (int i = array.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            int j = rand.nextInt(i + 1);
            swap(array, i, j);
        }
        return array;
    }
    
    private void swap(int[] array, int i, int j) {
        int temp = array[i];
        array[i] = array[j];
        array[j] = temp;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization:** O(n) because of the cloning process.
- **Reset:** O(n) for cloning the original array.
- **Shuffle:** O(n) for the Fisher-Yates shuffle, which involves a single pass through the array.

The space complexity is O(n) due to storage of the additional copies of the array.
