[Leetcode 3207. Maximum Points After Enemy Battles](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3207)
### Problem Statement

You are given two arrays of integers `player` and `enemy`. Both arrays are of the same length `n` and represent the points scored by the player and enemy in `n` battles, respectively. You need to re-arrange the player's points to maximize the total points the player can get, provided that in each battle (index `i`), if the player's points are greater than the enemy's, the player scores points for that battle.

Return the maximum total points the player can achieve after optimal arrangement of the player's points.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Should the rearrangement be sorted to maximize points?**
   - Yes, optimally arranging playerâ€™s points to maximize the total score.

2. **Can we assume that both arrays are of the same length and always valid (no nulls or mismatched lengths)?**
   - Yes, we can assume both arrays are of the same length and non-null.

3. **What type of values can the points arrays hold?**
   - Both the player and enemy arrays contain integer points, which can be positive or zero.

### Strategy

1. **Sort Both Arrays:**
   - Sort both `player` and `enemy` arrays. While sorting the `player` array in ascending order, we keep another sorted version to be used in the comparison.

2. **Two-Pointer Technique:**
   - Use a two-pointer technique where we keep track of the position in the `enemy` array we are attempting to beat.
  
3. **Comparison and Points Calculation:**
   - Iterate through the `player` array. For each player's point, attempt to beat the current enemy's point.
   - If the player's current point is greater than the enemy's, increment total points and advance the enemy pointer to the next enemy point.
   - Keep iterating until we have gone through all battles.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - The total points accumulated will be the maximum points the player can achieve.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MaximumPointsAfterEnemyBattlesOut {
    public int maxPoints(int[] player, int[] enemy) {
        // Sort both player and enemy arrays
        Arrays.sort(player);
        Arrays.sort(enemy);
        
        int maxPoints = 0;
        int enemyIndex = 0;
        int n = player.length;
        
        // Iterate over the sorted player array
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (player[i] > enemy[enemyIndex]) {
                maxPoints += player[i];
                enemyIndex++;
            }
            // If we have reached the end of the enemy array, we can stop
            if (enemyIndex == n) {
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return maxPoints;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximumPointsAfterEnemyBattlesOut solution = new MaximumPointsAfterEnemyBattlesOut();
        int[] player = {5, 1, 3, 7};
        int[] enemy = {2, 2, 6, 8};
        int maxPoints = solution.maxPoints(player, enemy);
        System.out.println("Max Points: " + maxPoints);  // Output should be 17
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** Sorting both arrays will take \(O(n \log n)\) time.
- **Two-Pointer Iteration:** Iterating through the arrays takes \(O(n)\) time.

Thus, the total time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

This should efficiently solve the problem within the constraints commonly expected in coding interviews.
