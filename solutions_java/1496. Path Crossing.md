[Leetcode 1496. Path Crossing](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1496)
### Problem Statement:
You are given a string `path` that describes the movement of a person on a 2D grid. Each character in the string represents a move:
- 'N' for moving north (up),
- 'S' for moving south (down),
- 'E' for moving east (right),
- 'W' for moving west (left).

The person starts at the origin (0, 0) on the grid. Return `true` if the path crosses itself at any point, that is, if the person visits a grid point more than once and `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Q:** What should be returned if the path is empty?
   - **A:** Since there would be no movement, the output should be `false`.

2. **Q:** Can the path contain invalid characters?
   - **A:** Based on the problem statement, it's assumed that the path consists only of valid characters{'N', 'S', 'E', 'W'}.

3. **Q:** Are we given any constraints on the length of the path?
   - **A:** Typical constraints in coding interview problems would expect us to handle up to 10^5 characters efficiently. However, if not explicitly stated otherwise, let's assume a reasonable upper limit like 10^4 for the sake of our solution.

### Strategy:
1. **Coordinate System:** Use a pair of coordinates `(x, y)` to track the current position on the grid.
2. **Track Visited Points:** Use a `HashSet` to store positions that have been visited.
3. **Movement Updates:** Based on each character in the path:
   - 'N': move north (y + 1),
   - 'S': move south (y - 1),
   - 'E': move east (x + 1),
   - 'W': move west (x - 1).
4. **Check for Revisit:** After updating the coordinates for each move, check if the new position is already in the `HashSet`. If it is, return `true`. If not, add the new position to the `HashSet`.
5. If the loop completes without finding any revisits, return `false`.

### Code:
```java
import java.util.HashSet;

public class PathCrossing {
    public boolean isPathCrossing(String path) {
        // Initialize starting point at (0, 0)
        int x = 0, y = 0;
        
        // Use a HashSet to track visited coordinates
        HashSet<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
        visited.add(x + "," + y);
        
        for (char move : path.toCharArray()) {
            // Update coordinates based on move
            switch (move) {
                case 'N' -> y++;
                case 'S' -> y--;
                case 'E' -> x++;
                case 'W' -> x--;
            }
            
            // Form a unique string for the current position
            String currentPosition = x + "," + y;
            
            // Check if current position is already visited
            if (!visited.add(currentPosition)) {
                return true; // Path crosses itself
            }
        }
        
        // No crossing found
        return false;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PathCrossing solution = new PathCrossing();
        // Example test cases
        System.out.println(solution.isPathCrossing("NES")); // Output: false
        System.out.println(solution.isPathCrossing("NESWW")); // Output: true
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** O(N) where N is the length of the path. Each character in the string is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N) in the worst-case scenario where each move lands on a different coordinate. The HashSet will store up to N coordinates.
