[Leetcode 963. Minimum Area Rectangle II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l963)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of points in the coordinate plane. Return the minimum area of a rectangle formed from these points, with sides not necessarily parallel to the x and y axes. If there isn't any rectangle, return 0.

You can think of the points as floating-point numbers.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are the coordinates always with a precision of two decimal places as maximum?
   - **A:** Yes, the coordinates are floating-point numbers with up to two decimal places.

2. **Q:** Is there any constraint on the number of points?
   - **A:** The number of points will be at most 50, which makes brute force approaches feasible within reasonable runtime.

3. **Q:** Can we have duplicate points in the input?
   - **A:** No, all points are unique.

### Strategy

1. **Convert Points to Complex Numbers:** We can represent each point as a complex number (x + yi), where x and y are the coordinates. This allows us to use vector operations more easily.

2. **Check for Right Angles:** For each pair of points (A, B), check all other points (C, D) to see if we can form two right-angled triangles (ABC and ABD). This can be done by verifying if the dot product of vectors AB and AD is zero.

3. **Calculate Area:** If a rectangle is formed, calculate its area using the distance between points.

4. **Track Minimum Area:** Keep track of the minimum area found during the process.

5. **Early Exit:** If a rectangle is not found, return 0.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public double minAreaFreeRect(int[][] points) {
        int n = points.length;
        Map<String, List<int[]>> map = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                int cx = points[i][0] + points[j][0];
                int cy = points[i][1] + points[j][1];
                double dist = Math.pow(points[i][0] - points[j][0], 2) + Math.pow(points[i][1] - points[j][1], 2);
                
                String key = cx + "," + cy + "," + dist;
                map.putIfAbsent(key, new ArrayList<>());
                map.get(key).add(new int[]{i, j});
            }
        }
        
        double minArea = Double.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (List<int[]> pointPairs : map.values()) {
            int m = pointPairs.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
                for (int j = i + 1; j < m; j++) {
                    int[] pair1 = pointPairs.get(i);
                    int[] pair2 = pointPairs.get(j);
                    
                    int[] p1 = points[pair1[0]], p2 = points[pair1[1]];
                    int[] p3 = points[pair2[0]], p4 = points[pair2[1]];
                    
                    double area = Math.sqrt(Math.pow(p1[0] - p3[0], 2) + Math.pow(p1[1] - p3[1], 2)) *
                                  Math.sqrt(Math.pow(p1[0] - p4[0], 2) + Math.pow(p1[1] - p4[1], 2));
                    minArea = Math.min(minArea, area);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return minArea == Double.MAX_VALUE ? 0 : minArea;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Adding to Map:** O(n^2) - Each pair of points is considered once.
- **Finding Minimum Area:** O(n^2) - Each combination of entries in the map must be checked.

**Total:** O(n^2) + O(n^2) = O(n^2) which is feasible given the constraint of n being at most 50.
