[Leetcode 1071. Greatest Common Divisor of Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1071)
### Problem Statement
You are given two strings `str1` and `str2`. You need to determine the largest string `x` such that `x` divides both `str1` and `str2`. A string `a` is said to divide string `b` if `b` is formed by concatenating `a` one or more times.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What constitutes a string dividing another string?**
   - A string `a` divides string `b` if and only if `b` is formed by concatenating `a` one or more times.

2. **What are the lengths of the input strings?**
   - The lengths of `str1` and `str2` are not specified but we can assume that they are reasonable for typical interview problems.

3. **Are there any constraints on the content of the strings?**
   - The strings can consist of any characters, but in practical terms, it's often alphabetic characters.

### Strategy

1. **Check for Validity**: 
   - If `str1 + str2` is not equal to `str2 + str1`, there is no common divisor string. This comes from the observation that the concatenation in different orders should be equal if there is some common string `x` that can divide both strings.
  
2. **GCD of Lengths**:
   - Compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the lengths of `str1` and `str2` using the Euclidean algorithm.
   - The length of the greatest common divisor string must be the GCD of the lengths of `str1` and `str2`.

3. **Extract and Verify**:
   - Take the substring of `str1` from `0` to the length of the GCD.
   - Check if this substring divides both `str1` and `str2`.

### Code

Here's the Java implementation of the above strategy:

```java
public class Solution {
    public String gcdOfStrings(String str1, String str2) {
        if (!(str1 + str2).equals(str2 + str1)) {
            return "";
        }
        int gcdLength = gcd(str1.length(), str2.length());
        return str1.substring(0, gcdLength);
    }

    private int gcd(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            int temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.gcdOfStrings("ABCABC", "ABC")); // Output: "ABC"
        System.out.println(sol.gcdOfStrings("ABABAB", "ABAB")); // Output: "AB"
        System.out.println(sol.gcdOfStrings("LEET", "CODE"));   // Output: ""
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **GCD Calculation**: This typically runs in O(log(min(a, b))) time due to the Euclidean algorithm.
- **String Addition and Equality Check**: These operations are O(n) where n is the total combined length of the strings.
- **Substring Extraction**: This can be considered O(1) since it's directly creating a new string from the calculated GCD length, which is very efficient.
  
Overall, the time complexity of the implemented solution is O(n) where n is the combined length of the two strings.
