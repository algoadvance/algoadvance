[Leetcode 2375. Construct Smallest Number From DI String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2375)
## Problem Statement

You are given a pattern `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'I' for increasing or 'D' for decreasing. You need to construct the smallest lexicographical permutation of numbers from `1` to `n+1` that matches this pattern.

An increasing pattern 'I' at position `i` means `nums[i] < nums[i + 1]`. A decreasing pattern 'D' at position `i` means `nums[i] > nums[i + 1]`.

**Example:**
```
Input: s = "IDID"
Output: "13254"
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists only of characters 'I' and 'D'.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input string consist of only 'I's or only 'D's?**
   - Yes, the input string can consist of any combination of 'I' and 'D', including strings with only one type of character.
  
2. **Are the numbers always from 1 to (length of `s` + 1)?**
   - Yes, the numbers are always from 1 to `s.length + 1`.

3. **Can multiple correct results exist for a given input string `s`?**
   - No, the objective is to find the smallest lexicographical permutation.

## Strategy

The main idea is to use a greedy approach. We need to generate the smallest lexicographical sequence while respecting the constraints given by 'I' and 'D'. We can achieve this by using a stack to handle the 'D' sequences efficiently.

Hereâ€™s the basic strategy:

1. Iterate through the string `s` while maintaining a stack.
2. For each character in the string:
   - If it is 'I', push elements into the stack, then pop all elements to form part of the result (ensuring the smallest lexicographical order).
   - If it is 'D', keep pushing elements onto the stack.
3. At the end of the iteration, pop any remaining elements from the stack to complete the permutation.

This method ensures that the smallest lexicographical permutation is constructed.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class SmallestNumberFromDIString {
    public static String smallestNumber(String s) {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        int n = s.length();

        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            stack.push(i + 1);
            if (i == n || s.charAt(i) == 'I') {
                while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
                    result.append(stack.pop());
                }
            }
        }
        return result.toString();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "IDID";
        System.out.println(smallestNumber(s));  // Output: 13254
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. This is because each character is processed exactly once, and stack operations (push and pop) are O(1).

- The space complexity is O(n) due to the auxiliary stack used to manage the sequence.

This approach efficiently constructs the smallest lexicographical permutation while maintaining the constraints imposed by the 'I' and 'D' characters.
