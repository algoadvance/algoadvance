[Leetcode 2572. Count the Number of Square](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2572)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. A subset of `nums` is square-free if the product of its elements is not divisible by any perfect square other than 1.

Return the number of square-free subsets of `nums` modulo 10^9 + 7.

A subset of `nums` could be an empty set (i.e., no elements are selected).

### Examples

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [3,4,4,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: The square-free subsets are: [3], [5], and [].
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1]
Output: 1
Explanation: The square-free subsets are: [].
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the allowable range of elements in `nums`?**
   - Elements can be any integer `nums[i]` within the constraints provided.

2. **What is the length constraint for the array `nums`?**
   - The length of `nums` is flexible as required.

3. **Can the input array `nums` contain negative numbers?**
   - Generally, such problems assume non-negative integers unless mentioned otherwise. We'll assume `nums` contains non-negative integers only.

4. **What is the maximum value for elements in `nums`?**
   - This needs to be confirmed by constraints, but for general implementation, we assume it to be manageable by standard data types.

5. **Is there a given constraint on time complexity?**
   - Optimizing for efficiency with Dynamic Programming would typically suffice for competitive programming constraints.

## Strategy

1. **Understanding Square-Free Numbers:**
   - A number is square-free if no square of a prime number divides it. For example, `8` is not square-free because it's divisible by `4 (2^2)`.

2. **Dynamic Programming and Bitmasking:**
   - Use Dynamic Programming (DP) to keep track of subsets and their products.
   - Use bitmasking to efficiently represent and manipulate the inclusion of elements in subsets.

3. **Tracking Multiples:**
   - Use a DP table to store counts of square-free products.
   - Iterate through all subsets and use the inclusion-exclusion principle to update these counts.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int squareFreeSubsets(int[] nums) {
        int MOD = 1000000007;
        int n = nums.length;

        // dp[i][mask] means the number of ways to pick square-free subsets using the first i elements
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][1 << 10]; // There are 19 primes <= 100, so the bitmask size can be up to 19

        // Initialize: there's 1 way to pick an empty subset
        dp[0][0] = 1;

        // Prime factors less than 100
        int[] primes = {2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 53, 59, 61, 67, 71, 73, 79, 83, 89, 97};
        int maxMask = (1 << primes.length); // maximum number of combinations of primes bitmask
        
        // Factorize each number in terms of primes
        Map<Integer, Integer> factorMask = new HashMap<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            int mask = 0;
            int temp = num;
            for (int i = 0; i < primes.length; i++) {
                int prime = primes[i];
                int count = 0;
                while (temp % prime == 0) {
                    temp /= prime;
                    count++;
                }
                if (count > 0) {
                    if (count > 1) {
                        // Not square-free if any prime factor appears more than once
                        mask = -1;
                        break;
                    }
                    mask |= (1 << i);
                }
            }
            if (temp > 1) mask = -1; // temp > 1 means there was a larger prime factor

            factorMask.put(num, mask);
        }

        // Start DP
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            int num = nums[i - 1];
            int mask = factorMask.get(num);

            for (int j = 0; j < maxMask; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j]; // Initialize: without taking this number, we inherit previous state
                
                if (mask != -1 && (j & mask) == 0) {
                    // If the number can be part of current subset without violation
                    dp[i][j | mask] = (dp[i][j | mask] + dp[i - 1][j]) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }

        // Sum all valid square-free subsets
        int result = 0;
        for (int j = 0; j < maxMask; j++) {
            result = (result + dp[n][j]) % MOD;
        }

        return result - 1; // subtract the empty subset count
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n \times 2^{m})\)
  - `n` is the length of the input array `nums`.
  - `m` is the number of primes in consideration (which is constant for `primes <= 100`, e.g., 25 primes).
  - Overall complexity is manageable for moderate-sized inputs since \(2^{25}\) is a constant and the dynamic programming table efficiently captures required states.

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n \times 2^{m})\)
  - Similar reasoning as above, mainly due to the DP table used.
