[Leetcode 3165. Maximum Sum of Subsequence With Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3165)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. Your task is to find the maximum sum of a subsequence in `nums` such that no two elements in the subsequence are adjacent elements in the array.

- The subsequence does not need to be contiguous in the array; it just cannot include any two consecutive elements from the array.
- The objective is to return the maximum possible sum of such a subsequence.

For example:
- For `nums = [3, 2, 5, 10, 7]`, the maximum sum is `15` because the subsequence `[3, 5, 7]` gives us the highest sum that doesn't include any adjacent elements.
- For `nums = [3, 2, 7, 10]`, the maximum sum is `13` because the subsequence `[3, 10]` provides the maximum sum.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Negative Numbers**: Can the `nums` array contain negative numbers? (Assume yes; the algorithm should handle this).
2. **Array Length**: What is the typical size of the `nums` array? Is it always within typical constraints (e.g., up to 10^4 elements)? (Assume it is within typical constraints).

### Strategy

The problem is a variant of the "House Robber" problem and can be solved using dynamic programming. The core idea is to decide for each element whether to include it in the maximum sum or not, without taking any adjacent element.

1. **Dynamic Programming Array (dp)**: Create an array `dp` such that `dp[i]` represents the maximum sum possible considering the subsequence up to the i-th element.
2. **State Transition**:
   - If we include the current element `nums[i]`, we cannot include `nums[i-1]`, so the sum would be `nums[i] + dp[i-2]`.
   - If we exclude the current element `nums[i]`, the sum remains `dp[i-1]`.
   - Therefore, `dp[i] = max(dp[i-1], nums[i] + dp[i-2])`.

**Base Cases**:
- `dp[0] = max(0, nums[0])`: The maximum sum considering only the first element.
- `dp[1] = max(dp[0], nums[1])`: The maximum sum considering the first two elements and ensuring non-adjacency.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the `nums` array, since we are iterating through the array once. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the additional `dp` array, but it can be optimized to O(1) by using two variables instead of an array for the state transitions.

### Code

```java
public class MaximumSumSubsequence {
    public int maxSumWithNoAdjacent(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        if (nums.length == 1) {
            return Math.max(0, nums[0]);
        }

        int n = nums.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n];

        dp[0] = Math.max(0, nums[0]);
        dp[1] = Math.max(dp[0], nums[1]);

        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i-1], nums[i] + dp[i-2]);
        }

        return dp[n-1];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximumSumSubsequence solution = new MaximumSumSubsequence();
        int[] nums1 = {3, 2, 5, 10, 7};
        int[] nums2 = {3, 2, 7, 10};
        System.out.println(solution.maxSumWithNoAdjacent(nums1)); // Output: 15
        System.out.println(solution.maxSumWithNoAdjacent(nums2)); // Output: 13
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: Check for edge cases and initialize the `dp` array.
2. **Iterate**: Loop through the `nums` array starting from the second element.
3. **State Transition**: Update `dp` array based on including or excluding the current element.
4. **Return**: The last element of the `dp` array gives the result for the maximum sum with non-adjacent elements.
