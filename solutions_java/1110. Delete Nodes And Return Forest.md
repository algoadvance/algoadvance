[Leetcode 1110. Delete Nodes And Return Forest](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1110)
### Problem Statement
Given the `root` of a binary tree, each node in the tree has a distinct value. After deleting all nodes with a value in a given array `to_delete`, we are left with a forest (a disjoint union of trees). Return the roots of the trees in the remaining forest. You may return the result in any order.

#### Example:
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], to_delete = [3, 5]
Output: [[1,2,null,4], [6], [7]]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the `to_delete` array contain values that are not present in the tree?**
   - Yes, it can. Those values should be ignored.
2. **Can the tree be empty (i.e., `root` is null)?**
   - Yes, in case of an empty tree, the output should be an empty list.
3. **What should be returned if all nodes are deleted?**
   - If all nodes are deleted, return an empty list.

### Strategy
1. **Use a Set for Quick Lookup**: Convert the `to_delete` array to a set for O(1) lookup times.
2. **Recursive Function with Flags**: Use a recursive function to traverse the tree, carrying a boolean flag indicating if the current node is a root of a new tree.
3. **Handle Deletion**:
   - If the current node needs to be deleted, recursively handle its children, making sure to treat them as new roots.
   - If the current node does not need to be deleted and is treated as a root, add it to the result list.
4. **Return the Result**: After processing the entire tree, return the list of roots collected.

### Code
```java
import java.util.*;

class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode(int x) {
        val = x;
    }
}

public class Solution {
    public List<TreeNode> delNodes(TreeNode root, int[] to_delete) {
        Set<Integer> toDeleteSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (int val : to_delete) {
            toDeleteSet.add(val);
        }
        List<TreeNode> result = new ArrayList<>();
        delNodesHelper(root, toDeleteSet, result, true);
        return result;
    }
    
    private TreeNode delNodesHelper(TreeNode node, Set<Integer> toDeleteSet, List<TreeNode> forest, boolean isRoot) {
        if (node == null) return null;

        boolean nodeToDelete = toDeleteSet.contains(node.val);
        if (isRoot && !nodeToDelete) {
            forest.add(node);
        }
        
        node.left = delNodesHelper(node.left, toDeleteSet, forest, nodeToDelete);
        node.right = delNodesHelper(node.right, toDeleteSet, forest, nodeToDelete);
        
        return nodeToDelete ? null : node;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(N) \)
  The function visits each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(N) \)
  We use additional space for the set and the recursion stack, which in the worst case could hold all nodes of the tree.

This approach efficiently deletes nodes while keeping track of the resulting forest, ensuring we return the required list of tree roots.
