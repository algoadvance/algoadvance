[Leetcode 1315. Sum of Nodes with Even](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1315)
### Problem Statement
Given a binary tree, return the sum of values of nodes with even-valued grandparents. A grandparent of a node is the parent of its parent, even if the grandparent is not necessarily at the root.

Formally, if the node's value is 'v', then there exists a grandparent of this node 'gv' such that gv % 2 == 0.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are node values positive, negative, or zero?**
   - Node values are integer values and can be both positive and negative (though typically, nodes in tree problems are non-negative).
  
2. **Is the tree guaranteed to have at least one node?**
   - Yes, you can assume the tree has at least one node.

3. **What is the maximum number of nodes in the tree?**
   - The constraint on the number of nodes would help us understand the potential for optimization. Typically, trees can have up to \(10^4\) nodes for problems of this nature on LeetCode.

### Strategy
1. **Traversal**:
   - We can perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse the tree. DFS can be implemented recursively or iteratively using a stack, while BFS uses a queue.

2. **Tracking Ancestors**:
   - Keep track of the grandparent and parent for each node during traversal. This can be done by passing the grandparent and parent down during the recursive calls or keeping these in tuples if using a stack or queue.

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - At each node, check if the grandparent exists and whether it is even-valued. If true, add the node's value to the sum.

Here, we'll use DFS with a recursive approach for simplicity.

### Code
```java
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

public class Solution {
    public int sumEvenGrandparent(TreeNode root) {
        return dfs(root, null, null);
    }

    private int dfs(TreeNode node, TreeNode parent, TreeNode grandparent) {
        if (node == null) {
            return 0;
        }

        int sum = 0;
        if (grandparent != null && grandparent.val % 2 == 0) {
            sum += node.val;
        }

        sum += dfs(node.left, node, parent);
        sum += dfs(node.right, node, parent);
        return sum;
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **TreeNode Class**:
   - Given in the problem statement.
   
2. **sumEvenGrandparent Method**:
   - Initializes the DFS traversal with `root` and `null` for `parent` and `grandparent`.

3. **dfs Method**:
   - It recursively traverses the tree.
   - `node`: Current node being visited.
   - `parent`: Direct parent of the current node.
   - `grandparent`: Grandparent of the current node.
   - If `grandparent` exists and is even-valued, add the node's value to the sum.
   - Recursively call `dfs` for left and right children, passing the appropriate nodes for `parent` and `grandparent`.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(N)\) where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the tree because we visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(H)\) where \(H\) is the height of the tree, which accounts for the recursive call stack. In the worst case, this is \(O(N)\) for a skewed tree and \(O(\log N)\) for a balanced tree.
