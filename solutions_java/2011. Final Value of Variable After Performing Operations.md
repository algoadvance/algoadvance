[Leetcode 2011. Final Value of Variable After Performing Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2011)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer variable `x` initialized to `0`. You are also given a string array `operations` where `operations[i]` is one of `"++X"`, `"X++"`, `"--X"`, and `"X--"`. You need to perform the operations on `x` and return the final value of `x`.

- `"++X"` and `"X++"` both increment the value of `x` by `1`.
- `"--X"` and `"X--"` both decrement the value of `x` by `1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the length of the `operations` array?
   **A:** The length of the `operations` array will be within the range 1 to 100.
  
2. **Q:** Are there any other types of operations except the four specified?
   **A:** No, the operations will strictly be one of `"++X"`, `"X++"`, `"--X"`, and `"X--"`.

3. **Q:** Can the operations array contain duplicate operations?
   **A:** Yes, the array can contain duplicates of the specified operations.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize** a variable `x` to `0`.
2. **Iterate** through each operation in the `operations` array.
3. For each operation:
   - **Increment** `x` if the operation is `"++X"` or `"X++"`.
   - **Decrement** `x` if the operation is `"--X"` or `"X--"`.
4. **Return** the final value of `x` after processing all operations.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int finalValueAfterOperations(String[] operations) {
        int x = 0;
        for (String operation : operations) {
            if (operation.equals("++X") || operation.equals("X++")) {
                x++;
            } else if (operation.equals("--X") || operation.equals("X--")) {
                x--;
            }
        }
        return x;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        String[] operations = {"++X", "X++", "--X", "--X"};
        System.out.println(solution.finalValueAfterOperations(operations)); // Output should be 0
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the `operations` array. This is because we are iterating through the array once and performing constant time operations for each element.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is **O(1)**, as we are only using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size (`int x`).

This solution efficiently handles the problem within the provided constraints and ensures correct results by properly processing each element in the `operations` array.
