[Leetcode 1301. Number of Paths with Max Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1301)
### Problem Statement
Given a square board of characters, you can move on the board starting from the bottom-right corner to the top-left corner. Each cell contains a digit from '0' to '9' or an obstacle 'X'. The goal is to find the path from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner with the maximum sum of the digits and to find out how many such maximum sum paths exist.

You can only move to the right, down, or diagonally right-down. Return a list `[max_sum, num_paths]` where `max_sum` is the maximum sum of the digits on the path and `num_paths` is the number of such paths.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Board Constraints**:
   - What is the size of the board? The board is an `n x n` grid, where `1 <= n <= 100`.
   
2. **Obstacles**:
   - Can obstacles completely block all paths? Yes, if an obstacle blocks all possible paths, the result should be `[0, 0]`.

### Strategy
1. **Initialization**:
   - Use `dp[i][j]` to store a list `[max_sum, num_paths]` for each cell where `max_sum` is the maximum sum obtainable to reach cell `(i, j)` and `num_paths` is the count of such maximum paths.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Start from the bottom-right corner of the board and move towards the top-left while updating `dp` based on the possible moves (right, down, diagonally right-down).
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, calculate the `max_sum` for reaching it by considering the cells `(i-1, j)`, `(i, j-1)`, and `(i-1, j-1)`.
   - Count the number of paths leading to `(i, j)` that give the `max_sum`.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle cells with obstacles 'X' by not updating them.
   - If it's impossible to reach the starting cell, return `[0, 0]`.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] pathsWithMaxScore(List<String> board) {
        int MOD = 1_000_000_007;
        int n = board.size();
        int[][] dpSum = new int[n][n];       // stores the sums
        int[][] dpPaths = new int[n][n];     // stores the number of paths

        dpPaths[n-1][n-1] = 1;  // start point
        
        for (int i = n-1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = n-1; j >= 0; j--) {
                if (board.get(i).charAt(j) == 'X' || (i == n-1 && j == n-1))
                    continue;
                
                int max_sum = -1;
                int paths = 0;

                // Check right cell
                if (j + 1 < n && board.get(i).charAt(j + 1) != 'X') {
                    if (dpSum[i][j + 1] > max_sum) {
                        max_sum = dpSum[i][j + 1];
                        paths = dpPaths[i][j + 1];
                    } else if (dpSum[i][j + 1] == max_sum) {
                        paths = (paths + dpPaths[i][j + 1]) % MOD;
                    }
                }

                // Check down cell
                if (i + 1 < n && board.get(i + 1).charAt(j) != 'X') {
                    if (dpSum[i + 1][j] > max_sum) {
                        max_sum = dpSum[i + 1][j];
                        paths = dpPaths[i + 1][j];
                    } else if (dpSum[i + 1][j] == max_sum) {
                        paths = (paths + dpPaths[i + 1][j]) % MOD;
                    }
                }

                // Check diagonal cell
                if (i + 1 < n && j + 1 < n && board.get(i + 1).charAt(j + 1) != 'X') {
                    if (dpSum[i + 1][j + 1] > max_sum) {
                        max_sum = dpSum[i + 1][j + 1];
                        paths = dpPaths[i + 1][j + 1];
                    } else if (dpSum[i + 1][j + 1] == max_sum) {
                        paths = (paths + dpPaths[i + 1][j + 1]) % MOD;
                    }
                }

                if (max_sum == -1) continue;  // no valid paths to this cell

                dpSum[i][j] = max_sum + (board.get(i).charAt(j) == 'E' ? 0 : board.get(i).charAt(j) - '0');
                dpPaths[i][j] = paths;
            }
        }

        return new int[] { dpSum[0][0], dpPaths[0][0] };
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of the above approach is \(O(n^2)\) since we iterate through each cell of the `n x n` grid once.
- The space complexity is also \(O(n^2)\) as we are using extra space for the `dpSum` and `dpPaths` arrays.
