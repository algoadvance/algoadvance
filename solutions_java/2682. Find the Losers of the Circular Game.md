[Leetcode 2682. Find the Losers of the Circular Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2682)
### Problem Statement
You are given a circular game with `n` players and a value `k`. The players are sequentially numbered from 1 to `n`, standing in a circle. Starting with player 1, every k-th player gets removed from the circle. After removing a player, the next player immediately to the removed player's right continues the game. The process repeats until only one player remains.

You need to return a list of all players that lose the game in the order they were removed.

**Example:**

```
Input: n = 5, k = 2
Output: [2, 4, 1, 5]
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= n <= 100`
- `1 <= k <= 100`

### Clarifying Questions
1. Will the list of losers always be in the order they were removed?
   - Yes, the list should be in the exact order in which players are removed.

2. Is the number of players `n` and the step count `k` always positive integers?
   - Yes, both `n` and `k` are positive integers as given by the constraints.

3. Should the function handle edge cases where `n` or `k` is 1?
   - Yes, for `n = 1`, the list of losers would be empty since no one will be removed.

### Strategy
1. Use a list to represent the players.
2. Iterate through the list, removing every k-th player.
3. Use modulo arithmetic to handle the circular nature of the list.
4. Keep track of the order of removal in a separate list.
5. Continue the process until only one player remains.
6. Return the list of removed players.

### Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class CircularGameLosers {
    public List<Integer> findLosers(int n, int k) {
        List<Integer> players = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            players.add(i);
        }
        
        List<Integer> losers = new ArrayList<>();
        int index = 0;
        
        while (players.size() > 1) {
            index = (index + k - 1) % players.size();
            losers.add(players.remove(index));
        }
        
        return losers;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CircularGameLosers game = new CircularGameLosers();
        System.out.println(game.findLosers(5, 2)); // Output: [2, 4, 1, 5]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization of player list:** O(n)
- **Removing each player:** O(n) because we might have to remove up to `n-1` players, each removal operation on an ArrayList (removing by index) takes O(n) time.
- **Overall Time Complexity:** O(n^2). This is because for each removal operation, the array might have to shift elements.

### Explanation
1. We start by creating a list of players numbered from 1 to `n`.
2. The variable `index` is used to keep track of the current position in the list.
3. In each iteration, calculate the next index to remove using `(index + k - 1) % players.size()`. This takes care of the circular nature.
4. Remove the player at this index and add them to the `losers` list.
5. Continue until only one player remains in the `players` list.
6. Return the list of losers.
