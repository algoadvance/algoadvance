[Leetcode 497. Random Point in Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l497)
### Problem Statement

Given a list of non-overlapping axis-aligned rectangles `rects`, write a function that randomly and uniformly picks an integer point in the space covered by the rectangles.

Each rectangle `rects[i]` is represented as a list, `[x1, y1, x2, y2]`, where `(x1, y1)` is the coordinate of its bottom-left corner and `(x2, y2)` is the coordinate of its top-right corner.

You need to implement the class `Solution` and the function `pick()` such that each point in the rectangles is chosen with uniform randomness.

```java
class Solution {

    public Solution(int[][] rects) {
        
    }
    
    public int[] pick() {
        
    }
}
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are rectangles non-overlapping and axis-aligned?**
   - Yes, all rectangles are non-overlapping and axis-aligned.

2. **Are there constraints on the range of coordinates for rectangles?**
   - The coordinates can be large, fitting within the typical range for integer coordinates.

3. **How frequently is the `pick()` function called relative to initialization?**
   - This isn't specified, but we'd aim to make both reasonable in performance.

4. **Do the rectangles include their boundary points?**
   - Yes, the edges of the rectangles are included in the points that can be chosen.

### Strategy

1. **Pre-computation**:
   - For each rectangle, calculate the total number of points it contains, which is `(x2 - x1 + 1) * (y2 - y1 + 1)`.
   - Keep a cumulative sum array of these point counts to help quickly pick a rectangle based on its area.

2. **Random Selection**:
   - To pick a point, first randomly select one rectangle based on the pre-computed weights.
   - Then, pick a random point within the chosen rectangle using the uniform range of its coordinates.

### Code Implementation

```java
import java.util.Random;

class Solution {
    private int[][] rects;
    private int[] areas;
    private int totalArea;
    private Random rand;

    public Solution(int[][] rects) {
        this.rects = rects;
        this.areas = new int[rects.length];
        this.totalArea = 0;
        this.rand = new Random();
        
        // Pre-compute the area (number of points) for each rectangle
        for (int i = 0; i < rects.length; i++) {
            int[] rect = rects[i];
            int area = (rect[2] - rect[0] + 1) * (rect[3] - rect[1] + 1);
            totalArea += area;
            areas[i] = totalArea;  // This keeps a cumulative sum of areas
        }
    }
    
    public int[] pick() {
        int target = rand.nextInt(totalArea);  // Pick a random area position
        int low = 0, high = areas.length - 1;
        
        // Binary search to find the rectangle corresponding to the target
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            if (areas[mid] > target) {
                high = mid;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        // Low now points to the rectangle we need
        int[] rect = rects[low];

        // Calculate random coordinates inside the found rectangle
        int x = rect[0] + rand.nextInt(rect[2] - rect[0] + 1);
        int y = rect[1] + rand.nextInt(rect[3] - rect[1] + 1);
        
        return new int[]{x, y};
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization (`Solution` constructor)**:
  - Pre-computation of areas takes \(O(n)\) time, where \(n\) is the number of rectangles.

- **Pick Method**:
  - Random number generation: \(O(1)\).
  - Binary Search: \(O(\log n)\) where \(n\) is the number of rectangles.
  - Random point selection within the rectangle: \(O(1)\).

Overall, the `pick` method has a time complexity of \(O(\log n)\).
