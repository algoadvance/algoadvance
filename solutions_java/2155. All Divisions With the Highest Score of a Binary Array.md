[Leetcode 2155. All Divisions With the Highest Score of a Binary Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2155)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed binary array `nums` of length `n`. `nums` can be split at index `i` (0 <= i <= n) into two arrays `nums.left` and `nums.right`:

- `nums.left` contains the first `i` elements.
- `nums.right` contains the elements from `i` to the end of the array.

If `i == 0`, `nums.left` is empty, and `nums.right` is the entire array. 
If `i == n`, `nums.left` is the entire array, and `nums.right` is empty.

The **score** of a split is the sum of the number of 0's in `nums.left` and the number of 1's in `nums.right`.

Return all distinct indices `i` that have the highest possible score. You may return the answer in any order.

### Example
Input: nums = [0, 0, 1, 0]
Output: [2, 4]

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the expected output if the entire array is zeros or ones?**
   - If the entire array is zeros, the highest score would be achieved when dividing as many zeros as possible into `nums.left`.
   - If the entire array is ones, the highest score would be obtained by having the whole array on `nums.right`.

2. **Could `nums` be empty?**
   - No, the problem guarantees that the length of `nums` is at least 1.

## Strategy

1. **Calculate the Total Number of Ones:**
   - First, compute the total number of ones in the array. This will help in computing scores efficiently.

2. **Iterate and Calculate Scores:**
   - For each index `i`, maintain a count of zeros in `nums.left` and compute the score,
   - Score at any split `i` can be computed using precomputed counts and the sum of 1's seen.

3. **Compare and Track Maximum Scores:**
   - Keep track of the maximum score encountered during the iteration and collect all corresponding indices.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Check for scenarios where all elements are zeros or ones as mentioned.

## Code

Let's implement the solution in Java:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> maxScoreIndices(int[] nums) {
        int totalOnes = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == 1) totalOnes++;
        }

        int zeroCount = 0, oneCount = totalOnes;
        int maxScore = oneCount;
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        result.add(0);
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i - 1] == 0) {
                zeroCount++;
            } else {
                oneCount--;
            }
            
            int currentScore = zeroCount + oneCount;
            if (currentScore > maxScore) {
                maxScore = currentScore;
                result.clear();
                result.add(i);
            } else if (currentScore == maxScore) {
                result.add(i);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Pre-computation of totalOnes:**
  - This is an O(n) operation as it involves a single pass through the array.
  
- **Iteration Through the Array to Calculate Scores:**
  - This is also an O(n) operation since it involves another pass through the array.

- **Overall Complexity:**
  - The overall time complexity of the solution is O(n), where `n` is the length of the binary array `nums`.
