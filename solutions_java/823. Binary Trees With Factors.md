[Leetcode 823. Binary Trees With Factors](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l823)
### Problem Statement
We are given an array `arr` of unique integers where each integer `arr[i]` is greater than 1. We need to find how many binary trees we can build where every node is a non-leaf node and its value can be formed by multiplying the values of two child nodes. Each value in the array `arr` can be used multiple times in the binary tree. The answer should be returned modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= arr.length <= 1000`
- `2 <= arr[i] <= 10^9`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can a single value form a tree by itself?**
   - No, each value must be a product of two child nodes.
2. **Are repeated values in the tree allowed if they are in the input array?**
   - Yes, values may be reused in different trees as long as they form valid structures.
3. **Should the root value also be part of the initial input array?**
   - Yes, all node values including the root must be part of the input array.

### Strategy
1. **Sort the array**: We shall start by sorting the array to easily find valid factors for each value.
2. **Dynamic Programming and HashMap for Counting**:
   - Use a hashmap (`dp`) where `dp[x]` will store the number of ways to form the value `x`.
   - Initialize `dp[x] = 1` for all `x` in `arr` initially since each value itself can form one tree.
3. **Populate DP Table**:
   - For each element `x` in `arr` and for each `y` such that `y*y <= x`:
     - Check if `x % y == 0` and `(x // y)` is also in `arr`.
     - Update `dp[x]` by adding the products `dp[y] * dp[x // y]`. 
     - If `y` and `x // y` are distinct, add the same product again (for `y, x // y` pairs).
4. **Calculate the Result**: Sum all values in `dp` and return modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Code
```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class BinaryTreesWithFactors {
    public int numFactoredBinaryTrees(int[] arr) {
        Arrays.sort(arr);
        long mod = 1_000_000_007;
        Map<Integer, Long> dp = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int a : arr) {
            dp.put(a, 1L); // Initialize each element to have one way to be a single node tree
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
                if (arr[i] % arr[j] == 0) {  // arr[j] should be a factor of arr[i]
                    int right = arr[i] / arr[j];
                    if (dp.containsKey(right)) {
                        dp.put(arr[i], (dp.get(arr[i]) + dp.get(arr[j]) * dp.get(right)) % mod);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        long result = 0;
        for (long val : dp.values()) {
            result = (result + val) % mod;
        }
        
        return (int) result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BinaryTreesWithFactors solution = new BinaryTreesWithFactors();
        int[] arr = {2, 4};
        System.out.println(solution.numFactoredBinaryTrees(arr)); // Output: 3
        
        arr = new int[]{2, 4, 5, 10};
        System.out.println(solution.numFactoredBinaryTrees(arr)); // Output: 7
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: \(O(n \log n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the array.
- **DP Table Population**: \(O(n^2)\) In the worst case, each pair of elements is checked.
- **Result Calculation**: \(O(n)\) as we sum up the dp values.
  
Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n^2)\), which should be efficient enough given the constraints (with \(n\) up to 1000).
