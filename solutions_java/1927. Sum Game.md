[Leetcode 1927. Sum Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1927)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `num`, representing a large integer. Each digit is a digit from '0' to '9' or a wildcard character '?'. The wildcard character can be replaced with any digit from '0' to '9'.

Here's the rule of the game:

- You and your friend take turns replacing the wildcard characters in the string `num`.
- You go first.
- The game ends when there are no wildcard characters left.
- If the sum of the first half of the digits is equal to the sum of the second half of the digits, your friend wins.
- Otherwise, you win.

Return `true` if you can win the game, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Is the input string always of even length?
2. Can the input string contain any other characters besides digits and the wildcard `?`?
3. Do both players play optimally?

### Strategy

Given the rules and constraints:

1. Separate the string into two halves.
2. Calculate the sum of the digits in each half, ignoring the wildcards for now.
3. Count the number of wildcards in each half.
4. Use the counts and sums to determine the optimal replacements for the wildcards.
5. Compare the sums by considering the best possible scenarios for both players.

### Code

```java
public class SumGame {
    public boolean sumGame(String num) {
        int n = num.length();
        int leftSum = 0, rightSum = 0;
        int leftWildcards = 0, rightWildcards = 0;

        // Calculate the sums and the count of wildcards in each half
        for (int i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
            if (num.charAt(i) == '?') {
                leftWildcards++;
            } else {
                leftSum += num.charAt(i) - '0';
            }
        }
        
        for (int i = n / 2; i < n; i++) {
            if (num.charAt(i) == '?') {
                rightWildcards++;
            } else {
                rightSum += num.charAt(i) - '0';
            }
        }
        
        // Max value we can achieve by replacing wildcards optimally
        int leftWildcardsMax = leftWildcards * 9;
        int rightWildcardsMax = rightWildcards * 9;

        // Difference in sums
        int diff = leftSum - rightSum;
        
        // Manage wildcards in both halves
        int totalWildcards = leftWildcards + rightWildcards;

        // If total wildcards is odd, you will always win
        if (totalWildcards % 2 == 1) {
            return true;
        }
        
        // Check if the difference in wildcards can be balanced
        int maxAdjustableDiff = Math.abs(leftWildcardsMax - rightWildcards) / 2;
        
        return Math.abs(diff) > maxAdjustableDiff;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `num`. This is because we need to traverse the string in order to compute the sums and count the wildcards for both halves.
