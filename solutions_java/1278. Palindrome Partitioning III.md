[Leetcode 1278. Palindrome Partitioning III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1278)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, you need to partition the string into `k` palindromic substrings. A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward. You should return the minimum number of characters that you need to change to make the string palindrome after the partition.

**Example:**

- Input: `s = "abc", k = 2`
- Output: `1`

**Explanation:** We can partition the string into `["a", "bc"]`, where `bc` can be changed to `b` and hence only one change is required.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can `s` be empty or can `k` be 0?
   - **A:** It is mentioned that `s` is a given string and `k` is a given integer. Generally, the problem would specify if we need to handle empty inputs or zeros. We assume that `1 <= k <= s.length`.

2. **Q:** What types of characters are in the string `s`?
   - **A:** The problem does not specify restrictions on the contents of the string, so it would be safe to assume it includes lowercase English letters.

3. **Q:** What is the range of lengths of `s`?
   - **A:** While not explicitly mentioned, typical constraints in similar problems suggest lengths up to a few thousand characters.

## Strategy

1. **Palindrome Cost Calculation:** 
   - We need a helper function to compute the minimum changes needed to make any substring `s[i:j+1]` a palindrome.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - We will use dynamic programming to store and reuse results for subproblems. Specifically, `dp[i][j]` will represent the minimum changes required to partition the substring `s[0:i+1]` into `j` palindromic substrings.

3. **Building the DP Table:**
   - Initialize `dp` such that `dp[0][0]` is 0 (no change needed for an empty string with 0 partitions).
   - Fill out the dp table iteratively for increasing values of `i` and `j`.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int palindromePartition(String s, int k) {
        int n = s.length();

        // Calculate cost to make any substring s[i:j+1] a palindrome
        int[][] cost = new int[n][n];
        for (int start = n - 1; start >= 0; start--) {
            for (int end = start + 1; end < n; end++) {
                cost[start][end] = (s.charAt(start) == s.charAt(end) ? 0 : 1)
                                 + (start + 1 <= end - 1 ? cost[start + 1][end - 1] : 0);
            }
        }

        // Initialize dp array
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][k + 1];
        for (int[] row : dp) Arrays.fill(row, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        dp[0][0] = 0;

        // Fill the dp table
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
                for (int m = 0; m < i; m++) {
                    if (dp[m][j - 1] != Integer.MAX_VALUE && cost[m][i - 1] != Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
                        dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], dp[m][j - 1] + cost[m][i - 1]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[n][k];
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing Cost:** Calculating the `cost` array takes O(n^2) time, where n is the length of the string `s`.
- **Dynamic Programming Table:** Filling the `dp` table involves nested loops, leading to O(n^2 * k) time complexity.
- **Overall Complexity:** The total time complexity is O(n^3 * k).

This solution ensures that we find the minimum number of changes needed to partition the string `s` into `k` palindromic substrings efficiently.
