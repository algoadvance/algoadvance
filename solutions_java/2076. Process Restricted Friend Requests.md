[Leetcode 2076. Process Restricted Friend Requests](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2076)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n`, representing the number of people in a social network, and an array `restrictions` where each `restrictions[i] = [xi, yi]` means that person `xi` and person `yi` cannot become friends. 

You are also given an array `requests` where each `requests[j] = [uj, vj]` means that person `uj` and person `vj` want to become friends.

Return a boolean array `result`, where `result[j]` is `true` if person `uj` and person `vj` can become friends and `false` otherwise.

## Example:
```
Input: n = 5, restrictions = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,3],[3,4]], and requests = [[0,4],[1,2],[2,4]]
Output: [true, false, false]
Explanation: Request 0: Person 0 and Person 4 can be friends. Request 1: Person 1 and Person 2 cannot be friends if restrictions are to be met. Request 2: Person 2 and Person 4 cannot be friends if restrictions are to be met.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are there any constraints on the size of `n`, `restrictions`, and `requests`?**
   - Typically, for these kinds of problems, constraints might be given. For this problem, considering typical constraints could help in planning optimizations.

2. **Can a person `xi` or `yi` be restricted with multiple other individuals or pairs?**
   - Yes, the problem statement indicates multiple restrictions can exist, so we need to ensure to check all restrictions.

## Strategy

1. **Represent the Network:** Use a Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union - DSU) to manage the friend sets.
   
2. **Handling Restrictions:** Before merging two friend sets (based on the requests), check if this merge would violate any restriction.
   
3. **Union-Find Operations:** Implement union and find operations with path compression and union by rank for efficient merging and finding sets.

4. **Check Restrictions Efficiently:** For each request, find the sets of `uj` and `vj`. Verify if merging these sets would conflict with any of the given restrictions.

## Code

Here is the implementation in Java:

```java
public class RestrictedFriends {

    private int[] parent;
    private int[] rank;

    public RestrictedFriends(int n) {
        parent = new int[n];
        rank = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            parent[i] = i;
        }
    }

    private int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x) {
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]); // path compression
        }
        return parent[x];
    }

    private boolean union(int x, int y) {
        int rootX = find(x);
        int rootY = find(y);
        if (rootX != rootY) {
            if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]) {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
            } else if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]) {
                parent[rootX] = rootY;
            } else {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
                rank[rootX]++;
            }
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }

    public boolean[] processRestrictions(int n, int[][] restrictions, int[][] requests) {
        boolean[] result = new boolean[requests.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < requests.length; i++) {
            int u = requests[i][0];
            int v = requests[i][1];
            int rootU = find(u);
            int rootV = find(v);
            boolean canBeFriends = true;

            for (int[] restriction : restrictions) {
                int x = restriction[0];
                int y = restriction[1];
                int rootX = find(x);
                int rootY = find(y);

                if ((rootU == rootX && rootV == rootY) || (rootU == rootY && rootV == rootX)) {
                    canBeFriends = false;
                    break;
                }
            }

            if (canBeFriends) {
                union(u, v);
            }
            result[i] = canBeFriends;
        }
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 5;
        int[][] restrictions = // use example above
        int[][] requests = // use example above
        
        RestrictedFriends rf = new RestrictedFriends(n);
        boolean[] result = rf.processRestrictions(n, restrictions, requests);
        for (boolean res : result) {
            System.out.println(res);
        }
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Find operation:** \( O(\log^* n) \) with path compression, which is very close to \( O(1) \).
- **Union operation:** \( O(\log^* n) \) due to union by rank.
- **Checking restrictions:** \( O(m \cdot k) \), where \( m \) is the number of requests and \( k \) is the number of restrictions, worst-case scenario is \( O(n^2) \).

The overall complexity is approximately \( O(m \cdot k) \), making it efficient for moderate-sized inputs.
