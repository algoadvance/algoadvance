[Leetcode 897. Increasing Order Search Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l897)
### Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary search tree, rearrange the tree in an "in-order" manner so that the leftmost node in the tree is now the root of the tree, and every node has no left child and only one right child.

Example:
```
Input: root = [5,3,6,2,4,null,8,1,null,null,null,7,9]
Output: [1,null,2,null,3,null,4,null,5,null,6,null,7,null,8,null,9]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Will the provided tree always be a binary search tree?
   - **A**: Yes, the tree will always be a binary search tree.
2. **Q**: What should be the output format?
   - **A**: The output should be in the form of the tree's in-order traversal where each node points only to a single right child.
3. **Q**: Can the tree be empty?
   - **A**: Yes, the tree can be empty. If the tree is empty, the output should also be an empty tree (or `null`).

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we should consider the following steps:
1. **In-order Traversal**: Perform in-order traversal on the binary search tree to get the nodes in sorted order.
2. **Reconstruction**: Use the nodes obtained from the in-order traversal to construct the new tree where each node points only to its right child, and there are no left children.

### Code
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */

class Solution {
    // Dummy node to act as a previous node pointer
    private TreeNode prevNode = new TreeNode(0);
    private TreeNode newRoot = prevNode;

    public TreeNode increasingBST(TreeNode root) {
        helper(root);
        return newRoot.right;
    }

    private void helper(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return;
        }

        // Recur on the left subtree
        helper(node.left);

        // Here `node` is the in-order fixation
        // Set left child to null
        node.left = null;

        // Set the previous node's right child
        prevNode.right = node;

        // Move to the next node
        prevNode = node;

        // Recur on the right subtree
        helper(node.right);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the binary search tree. This is because each node is visited exactly once during the in-order traversal.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(H)` where `H` is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack. In the worst-case scenario (unbalanced tree), this can be `O(N)`, but in the average case of a balanced tree, this would be `O(log N)`.
