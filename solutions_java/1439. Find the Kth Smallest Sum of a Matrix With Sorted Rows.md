[Leetcode 1439. Find the Kth Smallest Sum of a Matrix With Sorted Rows](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1439)
## Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` matrix, where each of the rows is sorted in ascending order, return the kth smallest sum out of all possible sums of one element from each row.

### Example:

```
Input: mat = [[1,3,11],[2,4,6]], k = 5
Output: 17
Explanation: Choosing one element from each row, the possible sums will be:
1+2=3, 1+4=5, 1+6=7, 3+2=5, 3+4=7, 3+6=9, 11+2=13, 11+4=15, 11+6=17.
The 5th smallest sum is 17.
```

### Constraints:

- `m == mat.length`
- `n == mat[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 40`
- `1 <= mat[i][j] <= 5000`
- `1 <= k <= min(200, n^m)`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can elements in the same row be chosen more than once for forming the sums?**
   - Answer: No, one element must be chosen from each row without repetition within that row.

2. **Can we take for granted that each row is sorted?**
   - Answer: Yes, the problem guarantees that each row is sorted.

3. **What should be done if multiple sums are the same?**
   - Answer: The problem implies we need to count distinct sums when ordered.

## Strategy

We’ll approach this problem with a combination of a min-heap (priority queue) and breadth-first search. Here’s a step-by-step breakdown of the strategy:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with the sum of the smallest elements of each row and push it into a min-heap.
   - Keep track of tuples representing the indices of chosen elements in each row with a set for visited states.

2. **Heap Processing**:
   - Iteratively extract the smallest element from the min-heap (which is the current smallest sum).
   - For each row, try to increase the index of the element selected (if possible) to form new sums.
   - Push the new sums back into the heap to find the next smallest sum.
   - Keep track of visited combinations to avoid duplicates.

3. **Termination**:
   - Continue extracting from the heap until we extract the `k`th element, which will be the desired sum.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class KthSmallestSumMatrix {
    public static int kthSmallest(int[][] mat, int k) {
        PriorityQueue<Element> pq = new PriorityQueue<>();
        int m = mat.length;
        int n = mat[0].length;
        
        int[] initialIndices = new int[m];
        int initialSum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            initialSum += mat[i][0];
        }
        pq.offer(new Element(initialSum, initialIndices));
        
        Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
        visited.add(Arrays.toString(initialIndices));
        
        while (k-- > 0) {
            Element current = pq.poll();
            int[] indices = current.indices;
            int sum = current.sum;
            
            if (k == 0) {
                return sum;
            }
            
            for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
                if (indices[i] + 1 < n) {
                    int[] newIndices = Arrays.copyOf(indices, m);
                    newIndices[i]++;
                    int newSum = sum - mat[i][indices[i]] + mat[i][newIndices[i]];
                    
                    String key = Arrays.toString(newIndices);
                    if (!visited.contains(key)) {
                        pq.offer(new Element(newSum, newIndices));
                        visited.add(key);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return -1; // k is out of bounds
    }

    static class Element implements Comparable<Element> {
        int sum;
        int[] indices;
        
        Element(int sum, int[] indices) {
            this.sum = sum;
            this.indices = indices;
        }
        
        @Override
        public int compareTo(Element other) {
            return Integer.compare(this.sum, other.sum);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] mat = // use example above
        System.out.println(kthSmallest(mat, 5)); // Output: 17
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity analysis is non-trivial due to the combination of heap operations and constraints:

1. **Heap Operations**: Each insertion and extraction from the min-heap costs `O(log(min(n^m, k)))`.
2. **State Processing**: The number of states processed can be bounded by `min(n^m, k)`.

Thus, the overall complexity would be approximately `O(k * log(k))`, given the constraints that make processing large states feasible yet bounded by a manageable size of `k`.
