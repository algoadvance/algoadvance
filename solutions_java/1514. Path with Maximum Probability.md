[Leetcode 1514. Path with Maximum Probability](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1514)
### Problem Statement
You are given an undirected, connected graph with `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n-1` and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [a, b]` is a bidirectional edge between nodes `a` and `b`. Each edge has a probability of success associated with it, denoted `succProb[i]`, which gives the success probability of traversing that edge.

Given two nodes `start` and `end`, return the probability of the maximum probability path from `start` to `end`. If there is no path, return `0`. All probabilities will be between `0` and `1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: What is the size range of the nodes and edges?
   **A**: Number of nodes `n` can be large up to \(10^4\), and number of edges `m` can be up to \(2 \times 10^4\).

2. **Q**: Can there be multiple edges between the same pair of nodes?
   **A**: The problem statement doesn't explicitly mention multiple edges between the same nodes, so we will assume there can be only one edge between any two nodes.

3. **Q**: Are edge probabilities guaranteed to be positive numbers between 0 and 1?
   **A**: Yes, all probabilities are between `0` and `1`.

### Strategy
1. **Graph Representation**: Construct the graph using an adjacency list where each node points to its neighboring nodes along with the corresponding probability.
2. **Algorithm Choice**: Use a modified Dijkstra's algorithm, where instead of finding the shortest path, you iteratively find the path with the maximum probability.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public double maxProbability(int n, int[][] edges, double[] succProb, int start, int end) {
        // Graph representation
        List<List<Pair>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        
        // Populate the graph with edges and probabilities
        for (int i = 0; i < edges.length; i++) {
            int u = edges[i][0];
            int v = edges[i][1];
            double prob = succProb[i];
            graph.get(u).add(new Pair(v, prob));
            graph.get(v).add(new Pair(u, prob));
        }
        
        // Priority Queue to store the nodes and the probability to reach them
        PriorityQueue<Pair> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> Double.compare(b.prob, a.prob));
        double[] probabilities = new double[n];
        probabilities[start] = 1.0;
        pq.add(new Pair(start, 1.0));
        
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            Pair current = pq.poll();
            int node = current.node;
            double prob = current.prob;
            
            // If we reached the end node, return the current probability
            if (node == end) {
                return prob;
            }
            
            // Update the probabilities for neighboring nodes
            for (Pair neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
                int neighborNode = neighbor.node;
                double newProb = prob * neighbor.prob;
                if (newProb > probabilities[neighborNode]) {
                    probabilities[neighborNode] = newProb;
                    pq.add(new Pair(neighborNode, newProb));
                }
            }
        }
        
        return probabilities[end];
    }
    
    class Pair {
        int node;
        double prob;
        
        Pair(int node, double prob) {
            this.node = node;
            this.prob = prob;
        }
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Graph Representation**: The graph is represented as an adjacency list.
2. **Priority Queue**: We use a max-heap (priority queue) to always expand the node with the highest current probability.
3. **Probability Array**: We maintain a `probabilities` array to store the maximum probability of reaching each node from the start node.
4. **Modified Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Instead of distances, we propagate the maximum probability through the graph.

### Time Complexity
- **Graph Construction**: \(O(m)\) where \(m\) is the number of edges.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: \(O((m + n) \log n)\), dominated by the operations on the priority queue.
- **Overall Time Complexity**: \(O((m + n) \log n)\).

This solution is efficient and should run within acceptable limits for the given problem constraints.
