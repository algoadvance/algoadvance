[Leetcode 2129. Capitalize the Title](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2129)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `title` which consists of one or more words separated by a single space, where each word consists of English letters. **Capitalize** the string by following the rules below:
- Return the string such that:
  - For a single letter word, it should be kept in lowercase.
  - For words with more than two letters, the first character is uppercase, and the rest are lowercase.
- Return the capitalized title as a string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are there any non-alphabetic characters in the input string?**
   - No, the input string consists only of English letters and spaces.

2. **Can the input string be empty?**
   - Yes, we need to handle the case where the input string is empty.

3. **Should leading or trailing whitespaces be removed?**
   - The input string does not contain leading or trailing whitespaces according to the problem description.

4. **What about words with exactly two letters?**
   - Words with exactly two letters should be converted to lowercase.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public String capitalizeTitle(String title) {
        // Split the input title into words
        String[] words = title.split(" ");
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();

        // Iterate through each word
        for (String word : words) {
            if (word.length() > 2) {
                // Capitalize first letter and set rest to lowercase
                result.append(Character.toUpperCase(word.charAt(0)))
                      .append(word.substring(1).toLowerCase());
            } else {
                // Convert entire word to lowercase
                result.append(word.toLowerCase());
            }
            // Append a space after each word
            result.append(" ");
        }

        // Trim the trailing space and return the result
        return result.toString().trim();
    }
}

```

### Strategy
1. **Splitting the Input**: We first split the input string by spaces to get individual words.
2. **Processing Each Word**:
   - If the word length is greater than 2, capitalize the first letter and make the rest lowercase.
   - If the word length is 2 or less, convert the entire word to lowercase.
3. **Concatenation**:
   - Append each processed word to a `StringBuilder`.
   - Append a space after each word.
4. **Trimming the Result**: After processing all words, trim the trailing space to produce the correct output format.

### Time Complexity
- **Splitting the String**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
- **Iterating Through Words**: O(w) * O(k), where w is the number of words, and k is the average length of the words. In total, this process also takes O(n) because each character is processed once.
- **Overall Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is efficient and scales well with input size.

This approach ensures that we handle all the given requirements within optimal time complexity.
