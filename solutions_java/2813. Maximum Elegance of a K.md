[Leetcode 2813. Maximum Elegance of a K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2813)
## Problem Statement

You are given a `nums` array containing `n` integers and an integer `k`. You aim to form a subsequence of length `k` from `nums` such that the subsequence has the maximum elegance. Here, the elegance of a subsequence is the sum of its elements.

You are tasked with implementing the function:
```java
public int maxEleganceSubsequence(int[] nums, int k)
```
that returns the maximum elegance of any `k`-length subsequence.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input array `nums` contain negative numbers?**
    - Yes, the input array can have negative, zero, and positive integers.
   
2. **What should we return if `k` is greater than the length of `nums`?**
    - Since `k` <= `n` is a typical constraint one might assume, it is acceptable to return 0 or handle edge cases accordingly.

3. **Are there any constraints on the size of the `nums` array (`n`)?**
    - Typically, constraints such as `1 <= n <= 10^5` and `1 <= k <= n` are assumed.

## Strategy

The optimal solution involves selecting a subsequence of length `k` with the greatest sum. Sorting `nums` in descending order and taking the first `k` elements will ensure the subsequence has the maximum possible sum:

1. **Sort the Elements**: Sort `nums` in descending order.
2. **Select the Top `k` Elements**: Select the first `k` elements from the sorted array.
3. **Compute the Sum**: Calculate and return the sum of these `k` elements.

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: Sorting `nums` will take `O(n log n)` time.
- **Selection and Sum Calculation**: Selecting the top `k` elements and summing them will take `O(k)` time.
  
Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step.

## Code

Here is the Java code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int maxEleganceSubsequence(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Sort the array in descending order
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int n = nums.length;
        
        // Create a variable for maximum elegance (sum of k largest elements)
        int maxElegance = 0;
        
        // Reverse loop to the last k elements of the sorted array
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            maxElegance += nums[n - 1 - i];
        }
        
        return maxElegance;
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Sorting**: The array `nums` is sorted in ascending order first.
2. **Selecting and Summing**: We then sum the last `k` elements, effectively using the largest elements.

By performing the reverse loop for the last `k` elements, we are using the largest `k` elements to form the subsequence, ensuring maximum elegance.
