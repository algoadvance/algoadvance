[Leetcode 2167. Minimum Time to Remove All Cars Containing Illegal Goods](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2167)
### Problem Statement
You are given a binary string `s` where a `'1'` represents a car with illegal goods and a `'0'` represents an empty car. The cars are lined up sequentially, and you want to remove all cars containing illegal goods. 

The time required to remove the `i`-th car is `(i+1)` seconds. For example, if you want to remove the 3rd car (0-indexed), it will take `(3+1) = 4` seconds. You cannot leave any car with illegal goods in the lineup.

Return the minimum time needed to remove all cars containing illegal goods one by one.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are we allowed to remove cars in any order, or must we follow any specific order?** 
    We can remove cars in any order to minimize the time.
   
2. **Do all cars with illegal goods have to be removed individually, or can we remove a range of cars?**
   Each car with illegal goods must be removed individually, but their removal order can be strategized to minimize the total time.

### Strategy
To minimize the total time to remove all cars containing illegal goods, let's break down the solution step-by-step:

1. **Find all indices of illegal goods:**
   Identify the indices of all '1's in the string since these are the cars with illegal goods.

2. **Determine the minimum time:**
   Calculate the time it takes to remove each car, ensuring we minimize the total time by considering the individual removal times.

Since we remove cars one by one and use the removal time for each car as `(i+1)`, where `i` is the car's index, we can implement a simple greedy algorithm to ensure minimum removal time through proper ordering and summation of times.

### Code
Here is the Java code to implement the solution:

```java
public class MinimumTimeToRemoveAllCars {
    public int minimumTime(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int totalTime = 0;

        // Iterate through the string to find all '1's
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '1') {
                totalTime += (i + 1);
            }
        }

        return totalTime;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumTimeToRemoveAllCars solver = new MinimumTimeToRemoveAllCars();
        String s = "1001"; // Example input
        System.out.println(solver.minimumTime(s)); // Expected Output: 6
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
Let's analyze the time complexity:
- **Finding the indices of '1's:** We iterate through the string once, which gives us O(n) time complexity.
- **Calculating the total removal time:** During the same iteration, we sum up the times, which is also O(n).

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`.

This approach efficiently computes the minimum time to remove all cars containing illegal goods.
