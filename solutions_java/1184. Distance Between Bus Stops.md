[Leetcode 1184. Distance Between Bus Stops](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1184)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `distance` where `distance[i]` describes the distance between the `i-th` bus stop and the `(i+1)-th` bus stop. You are also given two integers `start` and `destination` that indicate the start and destination stops, respectively (the bus stops are in a circular route).

Return the shortest distance between these two stops.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `start` be greater than `destination`?**
   - Yes, since the bus routes are circular, the `start` can be either greater than or less than `destination`.
   
2. **Will the input array be non-empty and contain positive integers?**
   - Yes, the input array `distance` will always be non-empty and contain positive integers.

3. **Are the indices always valid (i.e., within the bounds of the array)?**
   - Yes, `start` and `destination` will always be valid indices of the array.

4. **Can `start` be equal to `destination`?**
   - Yes, if `start` equals `destination`, the shortest distance is zero.

### Strategy
1. **Calculate the Clockwise Distance:** Traverse the bus stops from `start` to `destination` in a clockwise direction and sum the distances.
2. **Calculate the Counter-Clockwise Distance:** Traverse the bus stops from `destination` to `start` in a clockwise direction and sum the distances.
3. **Return the Minimum:** The result will be the minimum of the two computed distances.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int distanceBetweenBusStops(int[] distance, int start, int destination) {
        if (start == destination) {
            return 0;
        }

        int totalDistance = 0;
        for (int dist : distance) {
            totalDistance += dist;
        }

        int clockwiseDistance = 0;
        int counterClockwiseDistance = 0;
        
        int i = start;
        while (i != destination) {
            clockwiseDistance += distance[i];
            i = (i + 1) % distance.length;
        }
        
        counterClockwiseDistance = totalDistance - clockwiseDistance;
        
        return Math.min(clockwiseDistance, counterClockwiseDistance);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **O(N)** where `N` is the number of bus stops (length of the `distance` array):
  - One pass through the array to compute the total distance.
  - One pass from `start` to `destination` to compute the clockwise distance.
  - The counter-clockwise distance is computed using the total distance and the clockwise distance.

### Analysis
1. **Space Complexity:** O(1) because only a few extra variables are used for calculation.
2. **Edge Cases:**
   - The start is the same as the destination.
   - Small arrays, e.g., with 1 or 2 elements.
   - Circular calculation when the destination is before the start in the array.
