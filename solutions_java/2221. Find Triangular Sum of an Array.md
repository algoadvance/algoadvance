[Leetcode 2221. Find Triangular Sum of an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2221)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` is the i-th element of the array.

To obtain the triangular sum of the array, these steps are followed repeatedly until only one element remains in the array:
1. Create a new array `newNums` of length `nums.length - 1`.
2. For each index `i` in the range `[0, nums.length - 2]`, assign the value `(nums[i] + nums[i+1]) % 10` to `newNums[i]`.

Return the triangular sum of the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the input array contain negative numbers?
   - No, the array contains only non-negative integers as implied by the requirements.

2. What should be the size of the input array? Any constraints on the range of values?
   - The size of the array can be in the range of 1 to 1000, and each element is a non-negative integer (0-9).

### Code

Here's the Java code to solve the problem:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int triangularSum(int[] nums) {
        while (nums.length > 1) {
            int[] newNums = new int[nums.length - 1];
            for (int i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
                newNums[i] = (nums[i] + nums[i + 1]) % 10;
            }
            nums = newNums;
        }
        return nums[0];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        
        int[] nums1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        System.out.println(solution.triangularSum(nums1));  // Output: 8
        
        int[] nums2 = {5, 5, 5, 5};
        System.out.println(solution.triangularSum(nums2));  // Output: 0
        
        int[] nums3 = {9, 1};
        System.out.println(solution.triangularSum(nums3));  // Output: 0
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
    - Initialize the input array `nums`.

2. **Iterative Reduction**:
    - While the length of `nums` is greater than 1:
        - Create a new array `newNums` of size `nums.length - 1`.
        - For each index `i` from 0 to `nums.length - 2`, calculate the sum of `nums[i]` and `nums[i + 1]`, take modulo 10, and assign it to `newNums[i]`.
        - Update `nums` to be `newNums`.

3. **Return The Result**:
    - Once the loop ends, return the single remaining element in `nums`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is `O(n^2)`, where `n` is the length of the input array. This is because the first iteration processes `n` elements, the second processes `n-1`, and so forth, resulting in a summation series of `n + (n-1) + ... + 1` which is `O(n^2)`.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(n)`. In each iteration, we create a new array of size one less than the current array. The maximum space needed is the size of the input array.
