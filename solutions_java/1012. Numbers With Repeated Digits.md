[Leetcode 1012. Numbers With Repeated Digits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1012)
## Problem Statement

Given a positive integer `N`, return the number of positive integers less than or equal to `N` that have at least one repeated digit.

**Example:**

1. Input: `N = 20`
   Output: `1` 
   
2. Input: `N = 100`
   Output: `10`

3. Input: `N = 1000`
   Output: `262`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can `N` be 0?
   **A:** No, `N` can only be a positive integer as per the prompt.
   
2. **Q:** Is there a limit on how large `N` can be?
   **A:** The problem typically assumes `N` fits within standard 32-bit integer limits, so up to `2,147,483,647`.

3. **Q:** Do single-digit numbers (1-9) count as having no repeated digits?
   **A:** Yes, single-digit numbers have no repeated digits by definition.

## Strategy

### Approach

1. **Step 1:** Count total numbers from `1` to `N`.
2. **Step 2:** Use backtracking to count the numbers that do not have repeated digits.
3. **Step 3:** Subtract the count of non-repeated digit numbers from total to get the count of numbers with repeated digits.

#### Detailed Steps

1. **Count Non-Repeated Digit Numbers:** 
   - Use backtracking to generate numbers where each digit is used at most once.
   - Check for all numbers with lengths `1` to the number of digits in `N`.
   
2. **Calculate Result:** 
   - Total numbers from `1` to `N` is simply `N`.
   - Total numbers with at least one repeated digit is `(N - count of non-repeated digit numbers)`.

### Implementation

Here's an implementation of this approach in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int numDupDigitsAtMostN(int N) {
        return N - numNonDupDigitsAtMostN(N);
    }

    private int numNonDupDigitsAtMostN(int N) {
        String s = String.valueOf(N);
        int n = s.length();
        int[] factorial = new int[10];
        factorial[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < 10; i++)
            factorial[i] = factorial[i - 1] * i;

        int res = 0;

        // Count numbers with length less than n and without repeated digits
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            res += 9 * factorial[9] / factorial[10 - i];
        }

        // Count numbers with length n and without repeated digits
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[10];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int digit = s.charAt(i) - '0';
            for (int j = i == 0 ? 1 : 0; j < digit; j++) {
                if (!visited[j]) {
                    res += factorial[9 - i] / factorial[10 - n];
                }
            }
            if (visited[digit]) return res;
            visited[digit] = true;
        }
        return res + 1;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity can be analyzed as follows:

- **Factorial Pre-Computation:** O(1) since it's a constant size (up to 9!).
- **Backtracking Calculation:** O(n) for each digit position, with nested loops giving a complexity about O(n^2) for generating all potential digit combinations.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(D * D)` where `D` is the number of digits in `N`.
