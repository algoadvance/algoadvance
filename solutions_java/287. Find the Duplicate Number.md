[Leetcode 287. Find the Duplicate Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l287)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums` containing `n + 1` integers where each integer is in the range `[1, n]` inclusive. There is only one duplicate number in `nums`, but it could be repeated more than once. Return the duplicate number.

You must solve the problem without modifying the array `nums` and use only constant extra space.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of values for `n`?**
   - Typically, `1 <= n <= 10^5`.

2. **Can the input array contain multiple duplicate numbers, or is there always exactly one number that repeats?**
   - There is always exactly one number that repeats, but it could appear more than once.

3. **Do we need to handle edge cases like an empty array or an array where no numbers are repeated?**
   - No, the problem guarantees that there will be a duplicate, and the array is of size `n+1` where `1 <= n <= 10^5`.

### Strategy
We will use Floyd's Tortoise and Hare (Cycle Detection) Algorithm to solve this problem. This algorithm leverages the idea that if you treat the array as a linked list where the value at each index points to the next index, the duplicate number will form a cycle.

1. **Phase 1: Finding the Intersection Point**
   - Initialize two pointers, both starting at the beginning of the array.
     - The "tortoise" moves one step at a time.
     - The "hare" moves two steps at a time.
   - Move both pointers until they meet. This meeting point is guaranteed to be within the cycle.

2. **Phase 2: Finding the Cycle Entrance**
   - To find the start of the cycle, initialize another pointer from the beginning of the array and keep the tortoise at the meeting point.
   - Move both pointers one step at a time until they meet. The meeting point now will be the duplicate number.

### Code
Hereâ€™s the implementation of the strategy in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int findDuplicate(int[] nums) {
        // Phase 1: Finding the intersection point of the two runners.
        int tortoise = nums[0];
        int hare = nums[0];

        do {
            tortoise = nums[tortoise];
            hare = nums[nums[hare]];
        } while (tortoise != hare);

        // Phase 2: Finding the entrance to the cycle.
        tortoise = nums[0];
        while (tortoise != hare) {
            tortoise = nums[tortoise];
            hare = nums[hare];
        }

        return hare;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - Both the tortoise and hare will take O(n) steps to find the intersection point and the start of the cycle.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - We use a constant amount of extra space for the pointers.
