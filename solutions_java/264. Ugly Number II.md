[Leetcode 264. Ugly Number II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l264)
## Problem Statement

Ugly numbers are positive numbers whose prime factors only include 2, 3, and 5. Given an integer `n`, return the `n`-th ugly number.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the integer `n`?**
    Typically, constraints on `n` would be 1 ≤ n ≤ 1690.

2. **Do we need to handle invalid input cases, such as `n` being non-integer or out of bounds?**
    For this problem, we can assume input `n` will always be a valid integer within the given constraints.

3. **What is the expected format for the output?**
    The output should be an integer representing the `n`-th ugly number.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming (DP) approach with the following strategy:

1. **Initialization**:
    - Create an array `dp` of size `n` to store the first `n` ugly numbers.
    - Initialize the first ugly number, `dp[0]`, to 1.

2. **Iterative Filling**:
    - Use three pointers `i2`, `i3`, and `i5` to track the next multiple of 2, 3, and 5 respectively.
    - Use three variables `next_2`, `next_3`, and `next_5` to store the next multiples of 2, 3, and 5 respectively initialized to 2, 3, and 5.

3. **Generate Ugly Numbers**:
    - For each position `i` from 1 to `n-1`:
        - Set `dp[i]` to the minimum of `next_2`, `next_3`, and `next_5`.
        - If `dp[i]` is equal to `next_2`, increment `i2` and update `next_2`.
        - If `dp[i]` is equal to `next_3`, increment `i3` and update `next_3`.
        - If `dp[i]` is equal to `next_5`, increment `i5` and update `next_5`.

4. **Return Result**:
    - The `n`-th ugly number will be at `dp[n-1]`.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n) because we are generating each of the first `n` ugly numbers exactly once. The space complexity is also O(n) due to the storage required for the `dp` array.

## Code

Here's the Java implementation:

```java
public class UglyNumberII {
    public int nthUglyNumber(int n) {
        if (n <= 0) return 0; // Edge case 
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        dp[0] = 1;
        int i2 = 0, i3 = 0, i5 = 0;
        int next_2 = 2, next_3 = 3, next_5 = 5;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            int next_ugly = Math.min(next_2, Math.min(next_3, next_5));
            dp[i] = next_ugly;
            
            if (next_ugly == next_2) {
                i2++;
                next_2 = dp[i2] * 2;
            }
            if (next_ugly == next_3) {
                i3++;
                next_3 = dp[i3] * 3;
            }
            if (next_ugly == next_5) {
                i5++;
                next_5 = dp[i5] * 5;
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n-1];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        UglyNumberII solution = new UglyNumberII();
        System.out.println(solution.nthUglyNumber(10)); // Output: 12
    }
}
```

This code follows the described strategy to generate and return the `n`-th ugly number efficiently.
