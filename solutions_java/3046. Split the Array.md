[Leetcode 3046. Split the Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3046)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. 
Partition the array into `k` adjacent (non-empty) subarrays, where the largest sum of these subarrays is minimized.

Return the minimized largest sum of the partition.

**Example:**
1. `Input`: nums = [7,2,5,10,8], k = 2
   `Output`: 18
   `Explanation`: There are four ways to split `nums` into two subarrays:
   - [7,2,5] and [10,8], with sums 14 and 18 respectively.
   - [7,2,5,10] and [8], with sums 24 and 8 respectively.
   - [7,2], and [5,10,8], with sums 9 and 23 respectively.
   - [7], and [2,5,10,8], with sums 7 and 25 respectively.
   The minimized largest sum among these is 18.

**Constraints:** 
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10000
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4
- 1 <= k <= min(50, nums.length)

## Clarifying Questions
1. Should the subarrays be contiguous?
   - Yes, they should be adjacent or contiguous subarrays.
2. Can the k subarrays contain different lengths?
   - Yes, we only care about dividing them into `k` adjacent subarrays.
3. Is there a specific range for k in relation to the length of nums?
   - `1 <= k <= min(50, nums.length)`, so it will always be valid to partition in a meaningful way.

## Strategy
1. **Binary Search for the Solution Space**: The largest sum we aim to minimize will lie between the maximum element (`max(nums)`) and the sum of all elements (`sum(nums)`).
2. **Greedy Subarray Division**: For a middle value in our binary search space, check if it can be a valid largest sum by trying to divide the array into `k` parts. If you can partition `nums` within this limit, the value is valid.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int splitArray(int[] nums, int k) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            left = Math.max(left, num);
            right += num;
        }

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (canSplit(nums, k, mid)) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return left;
    }

    private boolean canSplit(int[] nums, int k, int maxSum) {
        int currentSum = 0;
        int subarrays = 1;

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (currentSum + num > maxSum) {
                subarrays++;
                currentSum = num;
                if (subarrays > k) {
                    return false;
                }
            } else {
                currentSum += num;
            }
        }

        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {7, 2, 5, 10, 8};
        int k = 2;
        System.out.println(sol.splitArray(nums, k)); // Outputs: 18
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Binary Search**: Between `max(nums)` and `sum(nums)` gives a time complexity of `O(log(sum(nums) - max(nums)))`
2. **Partition Check**: Each check takes `O(n)` where `n` is the length of `nums`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n * log(sum(nums) - max(nums)))`. This is efficient given the constraints.
