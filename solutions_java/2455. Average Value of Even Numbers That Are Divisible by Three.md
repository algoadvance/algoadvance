[Leetcode 2455. Average Value of Even Numbers That Are Divisible by Three](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2455)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` of positive integers, calculate and return the average of all even numbers that are divisible by 3. If there are no such numbers, return 0.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input constraints:** What is the maximum length of the input array?
   - The array can have up to 10^4 integers.
   
2. **Input values:** Are all input values guaranteed to be positive integers?
   - Yes, all values will be positive integers.
   
3. **Return type:** Should the function return an integer or a float for the average value?
   - The function should return an integer. We'll take the floor value of the average if it's not a whole number.

4. **Edge cases:** What should be returned if there are no even numbers divisible by 3?
   - If there are no such numbers, the function should return 0.

### Strategy
1. **Iteration:** Iterate through the array and check each number.
2. **Conditions:** Determine if a number is both even and divisible by 3.
3. **Accumulation:** Accumulate the sum of these qualifying numbers and count them.
4. **Calculation:** Calculate the average based on the sum and count.
5. **Return:** Return the integer part of the calculated average or 0 if no qualifying numbers are found.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int averageValue(int[] nums) {
        int sum = 0;
        int count = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num % 2 == 0 && num % 3 == 0) {
                sum += num;
                count++;
            }
        }

        // If no even numbers that are divisible by 3 are found
        if (count == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Calculate and return the average (floor division)
        return sum / count;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **O(n):** The algorithm iterates through the array once, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) since we use a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the desired average with a guaranteed linear time complexity.
