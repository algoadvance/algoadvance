[Leetcode 2491. Divide Players Into Teams of Equal Skill](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2491)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `skill` where `skill[i]` represents the skill level of the i-th player. You need to form teams such that every team consists of exactly two players, and the total skill levels of the two players in each team is the same. The goal is to maximize the total product of the skill levels of the players in each team.

If it is not possible to form such teams, return `-1`.

### Example
```text
Input: skill = [1, 2, 3, 4]
Output: 14

Explanation:
- You can form two teams: (1, 4) and (2, 3).
- The total product of their skills is (1*4) + (2*3) = 4 + 6 = 10.

Input: skill = [1, 2, 3, 5]
Output: -1

Explanation:
- It is not possible to form teams with equal total skill.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What is the minimum and maximum length of the `skill` array?
    - Do skills have to be positive integers?
    
2. **Output Requirements:**
    - If teams cannot be formed, the function should return `-1`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
    - What to return if the `skill` array length is odd?

## Strategy

1. **Sorting and Pairing:**
    - Sort the `skill` array.
    - Use two pointers, one starting from the beginning (`low = 0`) and the other from the end (`high = n - 1`). This will help in easily forming pairs in such a way that one player's skill matches another to maintain equal totals.
     
2. **Summing and Validation:**
    - Calculate the sum of the first and last elements, and consider it as the target sum for all pairs.
    - Traverse through the array while forming pairs and ensure each pair sums to this target value.
    - Accumulate the product of paired values.

3. **Edge Handling:**
    - If not all pairs can sum to the target, return `-1`.
    - Handle cases where the length is odd early by returning `-1`.

## Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class DividePlayersIntoTeams {

    public int dividePlayers(int[] skill) {
        if (skill.length % 2 != 0) {
            return -1; // Odd number of players, impossible to form pairs
        }
        
        Arrays.sort(skill);
        
        int low = 0;
        int high = skill.length - 1;
        int targetSum = skill[low] + skill[high];
        int productSum = 0;
        
        while (low < high) {
            if (skill[low] + skill[high] != targetSum) {
                return -1; // Found a pair that doesn't sum to the target sum
            }
            
            productSum += skill[low] * skill[high];
            low++;
            high--;
        }
        
        return productSum;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DividePlayersIntoTeams solution = new DividePlayersIntoTeams();
        int[] skill1 = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        int[] skill2 = {1, 2, 3, 5};
        
        System.out.println(solution.dividePlayers(skill1)); // Expected output: 14
        System.out.println(solution.dividePlayers(skill2)); // Expected output: -1
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Sorting the Array:**
   - Sorting the array requires O(n log n) time, where n is the number of elements in the `skill` array.
 
2. **Forming Pairs:**
   - The two-pointer traversal involves O(n) time for combining the skills and calculating the products.
   
### Overall Complexity
The overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, hence it is **O(n log n)**.
