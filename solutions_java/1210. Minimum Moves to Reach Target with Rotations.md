[Leetcode 1210. Minimum Moves to Reach Target with Rotations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1210)
### Problem Statement
You are given an `n x n` grid, where every cell is either empty (0) or blocked (1). The grid represents a snake's board where the snake's head is at the top-left corner (0, 0) and its tail is at (0, 1).

The snake can perform the following operations:
1. Move right: If there are two continuous empty cells ahead of its head (i.e., to the right).
2. Move down: If there are two continuous empty cells below its head.
3. Rotate clockwise: The snake spans two horizontal cells, and the cell immediately below the head [i][j+1] is empty.
4. Rotate counterclockwise: The snake spans two vertical cells, and the cell immediately to the right of the head [i+1][j] is empty.

Return the minimum number of moves to reach the bottom-right corner (n-1, n-2, n-1, n-1) of the grid. Return -1 if the snake cannot reach the target.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are there constraints on the grid size?
    - A: The grid size `n` is between 2 and 100.
    
2. Can we assume that the initial and final positions will always be free for the snake?
    - A: Yes.

3. Are there any limitations on the number of moves the snake can make?
    - A: No explicit limit on moves; the goal is to minimize the moves.

4. Do we need to handle any obstacles dynamically, or are they fixed?
    - A: Obstacles are fixed, represented by the grid.

### Strategy
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Since we need the shortest path in an unweighted grid, BFS is appropriate.
2. **Queue for positions**:
    - The queue will store the current state of the snake, its head and tail positions, and the number of moves made.
    - Use tuples `(headX, headY, tailX, tailY, moves)` to track the position and orientation.
3. **Visited Set**:
    - Track visited nodes to prevent cycles.
4. **Valid Moves**:
    - Define all possible moves (right, down, rotate clockwise, rotate counterclockwise) and their validity conditions.
5. **Algorithm**:
    - Initialize with the starting state `(0, 1, 0, 0, 0)` (head at `(0,1)` and tail `(0,0)`).
    - Use BFS to explore all possible valid states.
    - Check end condition to terminate BFS when reaching `(n-1, n-1, n-1, n-2)`.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MinimumMovesToReachTargetWithRotations {
    static class State {
        int headX, headY, tailX, tailY, moves;

        State(int headX, int headY, int tailX, int tailY, int moves) {
            this.headX = headX;
            this.headY = headY;
            this.tailX = tailX;
            this.tailY = tailY;
            this.moves = moves;
        }
    }

    public int minimumMoves(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        
        // Start with the initial position of the head and tail
        Queue<State> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(new State(0, 1, 0, 0, 0));
        
        Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
        visited.add("0 1 0 0");
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            State current = queue.poll();
            int headX = current.headX, headY = current.headY;
            int tailX = current.tailX, tailY = current.tailY;
            int moves = current.moves;

            // Check if we've reached the target position
            if (headX == n-1 && headY == n-1 && tailX == n-1 && tailY == n-2) {
                return moves;
            }

            // Possible moves
            // 1. Move right
            if (headY + 1 < n && grid[headX][headY + 1] == 0 && grid[tailX][tailY + 1] == 0 && visited.add((headX) + " " + (headY + 1) + " " + (tailX) + " " + (tailY + 1))) {
                queue.add(new State(headX, headY + 1, tailX, tailY + 1, moves + 1));
            }
            
            // 2. Move down
            if (headX + 1 < n && grid[headX + 1][headY] == 0 && grid[tailX + 1][tailY] == 0 && visited.add((headX + 1) + " " + (headY) + " " + (tailX + 1) + " " + (tailY))) {
                queue.add(new State(headX + 1, headY, tailX + 1, tailY, moves + 1));
            }

            // 3. Rotate clockwise
            if (headX + 1 < n && headY - 1 >= 0 && grid[headX + 1][headY] == 0 && grid[headX + 1][headY - 1] == 0 && visited.add((headX + 1) + " " + (headY - 1) + " " + (headX) + " " + (headY))) {
                queue.add(new State(headX + 1, headY - 1, headX, headY, moves + 1));
            }

            // 4. Rotate counterclockwise
            if (headX + 1 < n && headY + 1 < n && grid[headX + 1][headY] == 0 && grid[headX + 1][headY + 1] == 0 && visited.add((headX + 1) + " " + (headY) + " " + (tailX + 1) + " " + (tailY))) {
                queue.add(new State(headX + 1, headY, headX + 1, headY + 1, moves + 1));
            }
        }

        // If we exhaust the queue and never reach the target
        return -1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumMovesToReachTargetWithRotations obj = new MinimumMovesToReachTargetWithRotations();
        int[][] grid = {{0,0,0,0,0,1},{1,1,0,0,1,0},{0,0,0,0,1,1},{0,0,1,0,1,0},{0,1,1,0,0,0},{0,1,1,0,0,0}};
        System.out.println(obj.minimumMoves(grid)); // Expected output 11
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n^2), where `n` is the dimension of the grid. In a worst-case scenario, we explore every possible state of the board, but the BFS ensures we find the shortest path efficiently, making it optimal for average cases too. The space complexity aligns with the BFS queue and visited set, being O(n^2) as well.
