[Leetcode 46. Permutations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l46)
### Problem Statement:

**46. Permutations**

Given an array `nums` of distinct integers, return all the possible permutations. You can return the answer in any order.

**Example:**

Input: `nums = [1,2,3]`

Output: `[[1,2,3],[1,3,2],[2,1,3],[2,3,1],[3,1,2],[3,2,1]]`

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Are all elements in `nums` distinct?**
   - Yes, as per the problem statement.
   
2. **Is there any specific order in which permutations need to be returned?**
   - No, the permutations can be returned in any order.

3. **What is the maximum length of `nums`?**
   - This isn't specified, but typically leetcode problems handle input sizes that are manageable within a few seconds of runtime.

### Strategy:

To generate all permutations of a list of distinct integers, we can use a backtracking approach. This approach involves constructing permutations in a depth-first manner.

1. **Backtracking Algorithm:**
   - Use a helper method that will take the current list and the remaining list of nums.
   - For each element in the remaining list, add it to the current list and recursively generate permutations for the rest of the elements.
   - When the remaining list is empty, add the current list to the result.

### Code:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    
    public List<List<Integer>> permute(int[] nums) {
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        backtrack(nums, new ArrayList<>(), result);
        return result;
    }

    private void backtrack(int[] nums, List<Integer> current, List<List<Integer>> result) {
        // Base case: If the current list has the same size as nums, a permutation is complete
        if (current.size() == nums.length) {
            result.add(new ArrayList<>(current));
            return;
        }
        
        // Recursive case: Try adding each number to the current list
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (!current.contains(num)) { // Ensure we don't add the same number
                current.add(num);
                backtrack(nums, current, result);
                current.remove(current.size() - 1); // Backtrack to try the next possibility
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3};
        List<List<Integer>> permutations = solution.permute(nums);
        for (List<Integer> permutation : permutations) {
            System.out.println(permutation);
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

The time and space complexity for generating permutations of a list of size `n` are as follows:

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n * n!)`
  - There are `n!` permutations, and each permutation takes `O(n)` time to generate.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`
  - The space required to store the current permutation and the additional space used by the recursion stack is `O(n)`. The total space for storing all permutations is also significant but usually considered secondary to the main algorithm's complexity.
