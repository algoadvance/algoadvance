[Leetcode 2302. Count Subarrays With Score Less Than K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2302)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. A subarray is called "good" if the sum of the subarray multiplied by the number of elements in the subarray is less than `k`.

Return the number of good subarrays of `nums`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [2,1,4,3,5], k = 10
Output: 6
Explanation: The good subarrays are:
- [2] with a score of 2 * 1 = 2
- [1] with a score of 1 * 1 = 1
- [4] with a score of 4 * 1 = 4
- [3] with a score of 3 * 1 = 3
- [2,1] with a score of 3 * 2 = 6
- [1,4] with a score of 5 * 2 = 10
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1, 1, 1], k = 5
Output: 5
Explanation: The good subarrays are:
- [1], [1], [1], [1,1], [1,1] with scores all less than 5.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of Input Values:**
   - What is the maximum length of the `nums` array?
   - What is the range of values for elements in the `nums` array?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - How should we handle an empty array?
   - Is `k` guaranteed to be positive?

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently:
1. Use a sliding window (two-pointer) approach to maintain a window of valid subarrays.
2. Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the current subarray. Expand `right` to include new elements and check if the subarray is good.
3. Calculate the score using the sum of elements in the current window multiplied by the number of elements.
4. If the score of the current window becomes â‰¥ `k`, increment `left` to reduce the size of the window and recalculate the score.

### Time Complexity
The proposed sliding window solution has a time complexity of O(n), where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. The `left` and `right` pointers move at most `n` steps each.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int countSubarrays(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int left = 0;
        long sum = 0;
        int count = 0;

        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            sum += nums[right];

            while (sum * (right - left + 1) >= k) {
                sum -= nums[left];
                left++;
            }

            count += (right - left + 1);
        }

        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums1 = {2, 1, 4, 3, 5};
        int k1 = 10;
        System.out.println(sol.countSubarrays(nums1, k1)); // Output: 6

        int[] nums2 = {1, 1, 1};
        int k2 = 5;
        System.out.println(sol.countSubarrays(nums2, k2)); // Output: 5
    }
}
```

This solution efficiently counts the number of good subarrays using a sliding window approach. It also handles edge cases and maintains linear time complexity by ensuring each element is processed a maximum of two times.
