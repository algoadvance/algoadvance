[Leetcode 1706. Where Will the Ball Fall full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1706)
### Problem Statement

You have a 2-D `grid` of size `m x n` representing a box, and you have `n` balls. The box is open on the top and bottom sides.

Each cell in the box contains a diagonal board represented by `/` or `\`. These boards direct the ball right or left.

- A ball starts at the top of each column and rolls down.
- After finally dropping out of the bottom of the box, each ball can do one of the following:
  - Fall out of the box and return the column index of where it came from.
  - Get stuck in the box and return `-1`.

You need to return an array `result` of size `n` where `result[i]` is the column that the ball falls out of at the bottom after they dropped in at column `i` from the top, or `-1` if the ball gets stuck in the box.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the dimensions of the grid?**
   - The grid can have varying dimensions, typically small to moderate sizes.

2. **Can balls start from any row other than the first row?**
   - No, all balls start from the top row (0th row).

3. **How does a ball get stuck?**
   - A ball can get stuck if:
     - It hits the vertical walls of the box.
     - It hits a diagonal board in such a way that it cannot continue moving (it might hit another board in a conflicting way).

### Strategy

1. **Simulate Ball Movement:**
   - For each ball starting at column `i`:
     - Simulate its path through the grid one cell at a time.
     - If it moves from `(r, c)` to `(r+1, c+1)` or `(r+1, c-1)` depending on the board direction.
     - Check for conditions under which it would get stuck:
       - The ball moves out of the grid boundaries.
       - The next cell to move into causes a conflict (opposite cells with opposing boards).
   
2. **Path Update Rules:**
   - When a ball is at position `(r, c)`:
     - If the board is `/` and the ball goes to `(r+1, c+1)` and there is a valid cell there.
     - If the board is `\` and the ball goes to `(r+1, c-1)` and there is a valid cell there.

3. **Complexity Analysis:**
   - **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n)` where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns since each ball might traverse the entire grid.
   - **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for the result array.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] findBall(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;
        int[] result = new int[n];

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int col = i;
            for (int row = 0; row < m; row++) {
                int nextCol = col + grid[row][col];
                
                if (nextCol < 0 || nextCol >= n || grid[row][col] != grid[row][nextCol]) {
                    col = -1;
                    break;
                }
                
                col = nextCol;
            }
            result[i] = col;
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialize Result Array:** 
   - An array `result` of size `n` is initialized to store the final output for each ball.
   
2. **Simulate for Each Ball:**
   - For each column `i`, initialize `col` to `i`.
   - Iterate over each row from top (0) to bottom (`m-1`).
   - Calculate the next column based on the current diagonal direction.
     - If the ball moves out of bounds or hits a conflicting board, break and set the result to `-1`.
   - Finally, store the exit column in `result[i]`.

This solution efficiently simulates each ball's path through the box, considering the possible cases for getting stuck or successfully exiting the box.
