[Leetcode 1053. Previous Permutation With One Swap](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1053)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of positive integers `arr`, find a lexicographically smaller permutation of `arr` that is strictly smaller than `arr`. If no such permutation exists, return the array itself. You are only allowed to make one swap between two digits in the array. Return the previous permutation of `arr` with one swap if possible.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: What is the range of values for the elements in the array?**
   - A: The elements in the array are positive integers.

2. **Q: What is the size constraint for the array `arr`?**
   - A: The size of the array `arr` can vary, but typically we focus on an optimal solution for `N <= 10^4`.

3. **Q: Are there any specific edge cases to consider?**
   - A: An edge case would include arrays that are already in the smallest lexicographical order, e.g., `[1, 1, 1]`.

### Strategy

1. **Identify the Breach Point**: Traverse the array from right to left and find the first element that is larger than the next element. This element is the "breach" point. Let's call its index `i`.

2. **Find the Largest Element to Swap**: After finding the breach point, look for the largest element on its right which is smaller than `arr[i]`.

3. **Perform the Swap**: Swap these two elements to get the lexicographically smallest permutation.

4. **Edge Case**: If no breach point is found, it means the array is in non-decreasing order, and hence, it is already the smallest permutation possible.

### Code

```java
public class PreviousPermutationOneSwap {
    public int[] prevPermOpt1(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;

        // Step 1: Find the breach point
        int i = n - 2;
        while (i >= 0 && arr[i] <= arr[i + 1]) {
            i--;
        }

        // If no breach point was found, the array is in non-decreasing order
        if (i < 0) {
            return arr;
        }

        // Step 2: Find the largest element to the right of the breach point that is smaller than arr[i]
        int j = n - 1;
        while (arr[j] >= arr[i] || (j > 0 && arr[j] == arr[j - 1])) {
            j--;
        }
        
        // Step 3: Swap the two elements
        int temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[j];
        arr[j] = temp;

        return arr;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Finding the Breach Point**: O(n)
- **Finding the Largest Element to Swap**: O(n)
- **Swapping the Elements**: O(1)

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, which is efficient for arrays up to the maximum constraint.

### Explanation

- **Step 1**: Traverse from the back of the array to find the breach where `arr[i] > arr[i + 1]`.
- **Step 2**: Look for the largest element smaller than `arr[i]` to the right of `i`.
- **Step 3**: Swap the elements found in Step 1 and Step 2 to get the result.

This method ensures that only a single swap is made to achieve the lexicographically smaller permutation closest to the input array.
