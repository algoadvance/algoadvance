[Leetcode 3122. Minimum Number of Operations to Satisfy Conditions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3122)
## Problem Statement
Given an array `arr` of positive integers, you have to perform a set of operations to satisfy a specific condition: for every index `i`, `arr[i]` should be divisible by `i + 1`.

You need to determine the minimum number of operations required to achieve this condition. An operation is defined as incrementing any element of the array by 1.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Can the array contain zero elements?
   - **A**: No, the array consists of positive integers.
2. **Q**: What are the constraints on the size of the array?
   - **A**: This would typically be part of the problem statement, but we will assume a reasonable range like \(1 \leq \text{arr.length} \leq 10^4\).
3. **Q**: Can the operation be decrementing an element?
   - **A**: No, it is specified to be incrementing an element by 1.
4. **Q**: Do we need to modify the array in place, or can we use extra space?
   - **A**: We can use extra space if needed to calculate the minimum operations.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we will iterate through the array and for each element, check if it is divisible by its 1-based index (`i + 1`). If it is not, we will calculate the minimum number of increments required to make it divisible.

Steps:
1. Initialize a variable to count the total number of operations.
2. Loop through the array:
   - For each element `arr[i]`, check if it is divisible by `i + 1`.
   - If not, compute the least number of increments required to make `arr[i]` divisible by `i + 1`.
   - Add the computed increments to the total operations count.
3. Return the total count at the end.

## Code
```java
public class MinimumOperations {
    public static int minOperations(int[] arr) {
        int operations = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            int index = i + 1;
            int remainder = arr[i] % index;
            
            if (remainder != 0) {
                int increment = index - remainder;
                operations += increment;
            }
        }
        
        return operations;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {2, 3, 4, 5};
        System.out.println(minOperations(arr)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

## Explanation of the Code
1. We initialize `operations` to 0.
2. We loop through the array using a for-loop where `i` goes from 0 to the length of the array minus one.
3. For each element `arr[i]`, calculate the 1-based index as `index = i + 1`.
4. Compute the remainder of `arr[i]` when divided by `index` (`remainder = arr[i] % index`).
5. If the remainder is not zero, calculate the increments needed as `increment = index - remainder`.
6. Accumulate the increment value to `operations`.
7. Finally, return the total number of operations needed.

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the array. This is because we are processing each element in the array exactly once.
- Space complexity is **O(1)** as we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
