[Leetcode 2462. Total Cost to Hire K Workers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2462)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of `costs` where costs[i] represents the cost of hiring the ith worker. You are also given an integer `k`, representing the number of workers you need to hire. You are required to return the minimum total cost to hire exactly `k` workers such that no two hired workers are consecutive in the list.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Inputs:**
   - What is the maximum length of the `costs` array?
   - What is the maximum value of each element in the `costs` array?
   
2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should be returned if `k` is 0?
   - What if the length of `costs` is less than `k`?
   - Are there any specific constraints or corner cases that need to be handled?

### Inputs and Assumptions

- The number of workers `n` (`costs.length`) is at most `10^4`.
- Each cost is a non-negative integer and does not exceed `10^6`.
- `k` can be any non-negative integer.
- If the number of elements in `costs` is less than `k`, it's impossible to hire `k` non-consecutive workers.

### Strategy

Given the constraints and requirements, this problem seems to be well-suited for a dynamic programming approach to keep track of the minimum costs efficiently. Here's a high-level strategy:

1. **Dynamic Programming Array:**
   - Create a dynamic programming (DP) array where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum cost to hire exactly `j` non-consecutive workers from the first `i` workers.

2. **Transition:**
   - For each `i` from 1 to `n` (length of `costs`), determine if hiring the ith worker is cheaper by comparing:
     - Not hiring the ith worker at all: use the cost from `dp[i-1][j]`.
     - Hiring the ith worker: add the cost of the ith worker to the cost of hiring `j-1` workers from the first `i-2` workers which is `dp[i-2][j-1]`.

3. **Base Cases:**
   - `dp[i][0]` is 0 (hiring 0 workers costs nothing).
   - `dp[0][j]` or `dp[1][j]` for `j > 0` is set to a very large number because hiring `j` workers from fewer than `j` workers is impossible.

4. **Result:**
   - The result will be in `dp[n][k]`.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity for this solution is `O(n * k)` since each state in the DP table `dp[i][j]` depends only on previous values and can be computed in constant time.
- The space complexity is also `O(n * k)` for storing the DP table.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int totalCost(int[] costs, int k) {
        int n = costs.length;
        if (k == 0) return 0;
        if (n < k) return -1;  // Not enough workers to hire k non-consecutive
        
        // DP table to store the minimum cost to hire j workers from first i workers
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][k + 1];

        // Initialize the dp table
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= k; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            }
        }
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = 0;
        }

        // Fill the DP table based on the state transition
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j];  // Case 1: Do not hire ith worker
                if (i >= 2) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], (dp[i-2][j-1] == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? Integer.MAX_VALUE : dp[i-2][j-1] + costs[i-1]));  // Case 2: Hire ith worker
                } else if (j == 1) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], costs[i-1]);
                }
            }
        }

        // The final result is the minimum cost to hire k workers out of n workers
        return dp[n][k];
    }
}
```

This code correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem, tracking the minimum total cost efficiently.
