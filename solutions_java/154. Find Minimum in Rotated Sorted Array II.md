[Leetcode 154. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l154)
### Problem Statement

Given the sorted rotated array `nums` that may contain duplicates, return the minimum element in the array.

Example:
- Input: `nums = [2, 2, 2, 0, 1]`
- Output: `0`

The array `nums` is initially sorted in ascending order and then possibly rotated (i.e., it might have been shifted to the right by a number of places).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Does the rotated sorted array always contain at least one element?**
    - Yes, the array has at least one element.
    
2. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
    - Yes, the array can contain negative numbers as well.

### Strategy

To find the minimum element in a rotated sorted array that may contain duplicates, we can use a modified version of binary search. The key steps are:

1. **Binary Search Basics:**
    - Use two pointers: `left` and `right`.
    - Compare the middle element with the rightmost element to decide which part the minimum element lies in.

2. **Handling Duplicates:**
    - If `mid` equals `right`, move the `right` pointer by one step to the left, because duplicates make it ambiguous regarding the smallest element's location.

3. **Narrowing Down Search:**
    - If the middle element is smaller than or equal to the rightmost element, then the minimum lies within `[left, mid]`.
    - If the middle element is greater than the rightmost element, the minimum lies within `[mid+1, right]`.

### Code

Here's how you can implement this logic in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
        
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (left + right) / 2;
            
            if (nums[mid] < nums[right]) {
                right = mid;
            } else if (nums[mid] > nums[right]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right--; // nums[mid] == nums[right]
            }
        }
        return nums[left];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Worst Case Time Complexity:** O(n) due to the presence of duplicates (e.g., the array might be `[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]`).
- **Average Case Time Complexity:** O(log n) when the duplicates are not present or do not affect the binary search significantly.

This solution uses binary search with additional steps to handle duplicates, which keeps the time complexity efficient in most cases.
