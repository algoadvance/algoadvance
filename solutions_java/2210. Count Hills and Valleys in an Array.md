[Leetcode 2210. Count Hills and Valleys in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2210)
### Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. An index `i` in the array is considered a hill if the following conditions are met:
- `i > 0`
- `i < nums.length - 1`
- `nums[i] > nums[i - 1]`
- `nums[i] > nums[i + 1]`

Similarly, an index `i` is considered a valley if the following conditions are met:
- `i > 0`
- `i < nums.length - 1`
- `nums[i] < nums[i - 1]`
- `nums[i] < nums[i + 1]`

Return the number of hills and valleys in `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can `nums` have equal and consecutive elements?
   **A:** Yes, `nums` can have consecutive equal elements, but these should not count as hills or valleys.

2. **Q:** What is the range of values in the array `nums`?
   **A:** The problem will specify that the values fit within a specified range which typically does not affect the logic of counting hills and valleys.

3. **Q:** What should be the output if the array `nums` has less than three elements?
   **A:** If the array has less than three elements, it is impossible to form a hill or a valley, so the result should be 0.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we'll iterate through the `nums` list starting from the second element and ending at the second last element (i.e., between indices 1 and `nums.length - 2`). For each element, we'll check the following:
- If it forms a hill, meaning it is greater than its neighbors.
- If it forms a valley, meaning it is less than its neighbors.

We'll maintain a counter to keep track of the number of hills and valleys.

#### Steps:
1. Initialize a counter `count` to 0.
2. Loop through the array starting from index 1 to `nums.length - 2`.
3. For each element, check if it satisfies the hill or valley condition.
4. If it does, increment the counter.

### Code
Here is the implementation based on the described strategy:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int countHillValley(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length < 3) return 0;

        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == nums[i - 1]) {
                continue;
            }
            
            int left = i - 1;
            // Move `left` to the leftmost non-equal value in the contiguous range
            while (left >= 0 && nums[left] == nums[i - 1]) {
                left--;
            }
            
            int right = i + 1;
            // Move `right` to the rightmost non-equal value in the contiguous range
            while (right < nums.length && nums[right] == nums[i + 1]) {
                right++;
            }
            
            if (left >= 0 && right < nums.length) {
                if (nums[i] > nums[left] && nums[i] > nums[right]) {
                    count++;
                } else if (nums[i] < nums[left] && nums[i] < nums[right]) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }

        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {2, 4, 1, 1, 6, 5};
        System.out.println(solution.countHillValley(nums));  // Output should be 3
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the implemented solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because we make a single pass through the array while sometimes looking ahead or behind by at most a few steps. 

The space complexity is O(1) because we are using a constant amount of extra space.
