[Leetcode 2731. Movement of Robots](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2731)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer `n` representing the number of robots. Each robot starts at a distinct point on a grid. You are also given a list `direction` where `direction[i]` is either 'L' or 'R', representing the initial movement direction of the `i-th` robot (left or right). The robots move at the same speed and all start moving at time `t = 0`.

When these robots encounter another robot, they will switch directions and continue moving.

Your task is to determine the final positions of the robots after they have stopped moving (i.e., when no more changes in direction due to collisions happen).

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can we assume that the robots only collide and swap directions when they encounter each other head-on at the same grid point?**
   - Yes, a head-on collision at the same grid point causes them to swap directions.
2. **Do robots wrap around the grid edges?**
   - If not specified, robots do not wrap around the grid edges.
3. **Should we assume the grid is infinitely large horizontally and robots can keep moving indefinitely?**
   - Yes, for the purpose of determining interactions, we assume the grid is large enough to accommodate all movements and swaps.

Once these assumptions are clarified, we can proceed with a strategy to find the final positions of the robots.

## Strategy
To solve the problem:
1. Simulate the movement of the robots in discrete time steps until no more changes in direction occur.
2. Use a data structure to track the positions and directions of each robot.
3. Detect collisions and manage direction changes.
4. Terminate when positions stabilize (no more direction changes due to collisions).

We can utilize a dictionary to maintain the positions and their respective directions, and then use a loop to simulate each time step.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class RobotMovement {
    
    public void finalPositions(int n, String[] directions) {
        Map<Integer, Character> robots = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Initial positions
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            robots.put(i, directions[i].charAt(0));
        }
        
        // Simulate movements
        boolean changed = true;
        while (changed) {
            changed = false;
            Map<Integer, Character> nextPositions = new HashMap<>();
            // Compute next position
            for (int pos : robots.keySet()) {
                char direction = robots.get(pos);
                int nextPos = direction == 'L' ? pos - 1 : pos + 1;
                // Detect collision
                if (nextPositions.containsKey(nextPos)) {
                    char existingDir = nextPositions.get(nextPos);
                    if (existingDir != direction) {
                        nextPositions.remove(nextPos); // They swap places
                        nextPositions.put(pos, existingDir);
                        nextPositions.put(nextPos, direction);
                        changed = true;
                    } else {
                        nextPositions.put(nextPos, direction); // No collision
                    }
                } else {
                    nextPositions.put(nextPos, direction);
                }
            }
            robots = nextPositions; // Update positions
        }
        
        // Print results
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Character> entry : robots.entrySet()) {
            System.out.println("Position: " + entry.getKey() + " Direction: " + entry.getValue());
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RobotMovement rm = new RobotMovement();
        rm.finalPositions(5, new String[]{"R", "L", "L", "R", "L"});
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: In the worst case, every robot may need to move several times before collisions reduce, leading to a time complexity of approximately **O(n^2)** where `n` is the number of robots.
- **Space Complexity**: The space required for storing robot positions and their directions is **O(n)**.

By implementing the above strategy, we efficiently simulate the movements and collisions of robots until they stabilize, giving us their final positions.
