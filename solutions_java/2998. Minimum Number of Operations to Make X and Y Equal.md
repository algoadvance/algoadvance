[Leetcode 2998. Minimum Number of Operations to Make X and Y Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2998)
## Problem Statement

You are given two integers `X` and `Y`. You need to make them equal by performing operations on them. In one operation, you can choose either `X` or `Y` and increase or decrease it by 1. Determine the minimum number of operations required to make `X` and `Y` equal.

### Example:
- Input: `X = 5`, `Y = 9`
- Output: `4`
  - Explanation: Increment `X` four times to get 9.

### Note:
- The problem is to find the absolute difference between `X` and `Y`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `X` and `Y` be negative?**
   - Yes, `X` and `Y` can be any integer, including negative, zero, and positive numbers.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the values of `X` and `Y`?**
   - There are no specific constraints mentioned, so we can assume they fit within the range of typical integer values in Java.

3. **Is this problem always solvable?**
   - Yes, since we can always adjust `X` or `Y` by increments or decrements of 1.

## Strategy

The strategy to solve this problem is straightforward:
1. Calculate the absolute difference between `X` and `Y`.
2. The result is the minimum number of operations needed to make `X` equal to `Y`.

### Formula
- The number of operations required is simply `|X - Y|`, where `| |` denotes the absolute value.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is:
- **O(1)** because the operations of subtraction and taking the absolute value are constant time operations.

## Code

Here's the Java code implementing the solution:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minOperations(int X, int Y) {
        return Math.abs(X - Y);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        // Example 1
        int X1 = 5, Y1 = 9;
        System.out.println("Minimum operations to make " + X1 + " and " + Y1 + " equal: " + solution.minOperations(X1, Y1)); // Output: 4

        // Example 2
        int X2 = -3, Y2 = 2;
        System.out.println("Minimum operations to make " + X2 + " and " + Y2 + " equal: " + solution.minOperations(X2, Y2)); // Output: 5

        // Example 3
        int X3 = 7, Y3 = 7;
        System.out.println("Minimum operations to make " + X3 + " and " + Y3 + " equal: " + solution.minOperations(X3, Y3)); // Output: 0
    }
}
```

This code calculates the minimum number of operations needed to make `X` and `Y` equal using the absolute difference. It then prints the results for the provided examples to verify the correctness of the implementation.
