[Leetcode 1568. Minimum Number of Days to Disconnect Island](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1568)
### Problem Statement

You are given a two-dimensional grid of 1s (land) and 0s (water). An island is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of 1s. The grid is said to be connected if we have exactly one island, otherwise it is disconnected.

In one day, we are allowed to change any single land cell (1) into a water cell (0).

You need to find the minimum number of days to disconnect the island.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Grid Size**: What is the maximum size of the grid?
   - The grid size is bounded by $1 \leq m, n \leq 30$ where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.
  
2. **Input**: How is the grid provided?
   - The grid is provided as a list of lists in Python or a 2D array in Java, where each element is either 1 (land) or 0 (water).
  
3. **Output**: What is expected as output?
   - An integer representing the minimum number of days to disconnect the island.

### Strategy

1. **Check Initial Disconnection**: Initially, check if the grid is already disconnected. If the number of initial islands is more than 1, return 0.

2. **Simulate Cell Change**: Iterate over each cell. If it is land (`1`), change it to water (`0`) and check if this operation disconnects the island. If it does, return 1.

3. **Two Changes**: If no single cell change can disconnect the island, try changing each pair of land cells to water simultaneously and check for disconnection. If this works, return 2.

4. **Final Answer**: According to the problem constraints, at most two changes should be sufficient. Thus, if both previous steps fail, return 2.

### Time Complexity

- Checking disconnection after one cell change involves performing BFS/DFS to check connectivity on a grid of size up to $30 \times 30$, resulting in a $O((m \times n)^2)$ complexity in the worst case.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    private int[] dr = {-1, 1, 0, 0};
    private int[] dc = {0, 0, -1, 1};
    
    public int minDays(int[][] grid) {
        int rows = grid.length;
        int cols = grid[0].length;
        
        if (countIslands(grid) != 1) return 0;
        
        // Check if removing one cell disconnects the island.
        for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
                if (grid[r][c] == 1) {
                    grid[r][c] = 0;
                    if (countIslands(grid) != 1) return 1;
                    grid[r][c] = 1;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Check if removing two cells disconnects the island.
        for (int r1 = 0; r1 < rows; r1++) {
            for (int c1 = 0; c1 < cols; c1++) {
                if (grid[r1][c1] == 1) {
                    grid[r1][c1] = 0;
                    for (int r2 = r1; r2 < rows; r2++) {
                        for (int c2 = (r2 == r1 ? c1 + 1 : 0); c2 < cols; c2++) {
                            if (grid[r2][c2] == 1) {
                                grid[r2][c2] = 0;
                                if (countIslands(grid) != 1) return 2;
                                grid[r2][c2] = 1;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                    grid[r1][c1] = 1;
                }
            }
        }

        return 2;
    }

    private int countIslands(int[][] grid) {
        int rows = grid.length;
        int cols = grid[0].length;
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[rows][cols];
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
                if (grid[r][c] == 1 && !visited[r][c]) {
                    count++;
                    if (count > 1) return count;
                    dfs(grid, visited, r, c);
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    private void dfs(int[][] grid, boolean[][] visited, int r, int c) {
        int rows = grid.length;
        int cols = grid[0].length;
        visited[r][c] = true;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            int nr = r + dr[i];
            int nc = c + dc[i];
            if (nr >= 0 && nr < rows && nc >= 0 && nc < cols && grid[nr][nc] == 1 && !visited[nr][nc]) {
                dfs(grid, visited, nr, nc);
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[][] grid = {
            {1, 1, 0, 0},
            {1, 1, 0, 0},
            {0, 0, 1, 1},
            {0, 0, 1, 1}
        };
        System.out.println(sol.minDays(grid)); // Should output 0
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initial Check**: `countIslands` counts the number of islands. If more than 1 island is found initially, the grid is already disconnected (return 0).

2. **Single Cell Change**: For each land cell, set it to water and check the number of islands using `countIslands`. If the number is not 1, return 1 day.

3. **Double Cell Change**: For each combination of two land cells, set both to water and check connectivity. If the grid is disconnected, return 2 days.

This approach ensures we efficiently find the minimum days required to disconnect the island using DFS to count islands and verify the connectivity.
