[Leetcode 830. Positions of Large Groups](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l830)
### Problem Statement
LeetCode Problem 830: Positions of Large Groups

In a string `s` of lowercase letters, a "large group" is a group where three or more consecutive characters are the same.

Write a function that finds the start and end positions of every large group. The function should return a list of lists of integers where each list denotes the starting and ending positions (inclusive) of each large group, in the order of their occurrence in the string.

**Example:**
```
Input: s = "abbxxxxzzy"
Output: [[3,6]]

Input: s = "abc"
Output: []

Input: s = "abcdddeeeeaabbbcd"
Output: [[3,5],[6,9],[12,14]]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input string contain non-lowercase characters?
   - No, the input string consists only of lowercase letters.
2. Are there any constraints on the length of the input string?
   - No specific constraints were given, but typically, interview problems handle strings of reasonable length that fit in memory.
3. Do overlapping groups occur?
   - No, groups are strictly consecutive characters.

### Strategy
1. Initialize an empty list to store the positions of large groups.
2. Use two pointers (`i` and `j`) to iterate through the string.
3. Initialize `i` at 0. Move `j` until characters at `i` and `j` are the same.
4. When characters differ or end of the string is reached, check the length of the group using the difference between `j` and `i`.
   - If the difference is 3 or more, record the start (`i`) and end (`j-1`) index of the group.
5. Update `i` to be at `j` and continue the process until the end of the string is reached.
6. Return the list of large groups.

### Code
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> largeGroupPositions(String s) {
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int n = s.length();
        int i = 0;

        while (i < n) {
            int j = i;

            // Move j until we find a different character
            while (j < n && s.charAt(j) == s.charAt(i)) {
                j++;
            }

            // If length of the group is 3 or more
            if (j - i >= 3) {
                List<Integer> group = new ArrayList<>();
                group.add(i);
                group.add(j - 1);
                result.add(group);
            }

            // Move i to j
            i = j;
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();

        // Test cases
        System.out.println(sol.largeGroupPositions("abbxxxxzzy")); // [[3, 6]]
        System.out.println(sol.largeGroupPositions("abc"));        // []
        System.out.println(sol.largeGroupPositions("abcdddeeeeaabbbcd")); // [[3,5],[6,9],[12,14]]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because each character is processed a constant number of times.
- Space complexity is O(1) for the space used aside from the input and output, though the output itself can take up O(n) space in the worst-case scenario.

With this strategy and code, the positions of large groups can be efficiently determined.
