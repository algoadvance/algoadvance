[Leetcode 1915. Number of Wonderful Substrings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1915)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string "word" consisting of lowercase English letters. A substring is called wonderful if it contains at most one character with an odd frequency. Return the number of wonderful substrings in the given string "word".

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the input size?**
   - The length of the string "word" can go up to 100,000 characters.

2. **What is the expected output?**
   - An integer representing the number of wonderful substrings.

3. **Any constraints on the input characters?**
   - The string "word" consists only of lowercase English letters.

### Code
Let's implement the solution in Java.

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class NumberOfWonderfulSubstrings {
    
    public long wonderfulSubstrings(String word) {
        // Map to store frequency of each mask
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> maskFrequency = new HashMap<>();
        // Initial condition: zero mask has occurred once
        maskFrequency.put(0, 1);
        int mask = 0;
        long result = 0;
        
        for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
            // Update the mask for current character
            mask ^= 1 << (c - 'a');
            
            // Check if the current mask has been seen before
            result += maskFrequency.getOrDefault(mask, 0);

            // Check for masks with one bit difference
            for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
                result += maskFrequency.getOrDefault(mask ^ (1 << i), 0);
            }

            // Update the frequency of the current mask
            maskFrequency.put(mask, maskFrequency.getOrDefault(mask, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Strategy
1. **Using a Mask to Track Frequencies:**
   - Use a bitmask to represent the frequency of each character seen so far. Each bit in the mask corresponds to a character (`a` to `j`).
   - Toggle the bit corresponding to the current character. This way, we can maintain if a character count is even or odd.

2. **HashMap for Frequency of Masks:**
   - We will use a hash map to keep track of the frequency of each mask we've seen.
   - Initialize the mask frequency with `0` having a count of `1`, since an empty prefix (zero count) is also a valid starting point.

3. **Calculate Wonderful Substrings:**
   - For each character in the string:
     - Update the current mask by toggling the bit for the current character.
     - Add the count of the current mask obtained from the hash map to the result.
     - Consider the scenario where there could be a single character with an odd frequency by toggling each bit of the mask and add those counts to the result.
     - Update the mask frequency in the hash map accordingly.

### Time Complexity
- The solution involves iterating through each character in the string and performs constant time operations with respect to the size of each character:
  - Toggling the bit in the mask.
  - Querying and updating the hash map.
  - Checking the 10 possible toggled masks.
- **Time Complexity:** O(n * 10 + n), which simplifies to O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
- **Space Complexity:** O(2^10) = O(1), as the maximum different masks we can have given 10 bits is 1024, which is constant space.
