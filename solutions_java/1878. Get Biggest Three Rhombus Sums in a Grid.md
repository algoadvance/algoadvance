[Leetcode 1878. Get Biggest Three Rhombus Sums in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1878)
### Problem Statement

Given a `grid` of size `m x n`, find the biggest three distinct rhombus sums in the grid. A rhombus sum is the sum of all numbers on the border of any rhombus centered at any cell `(i, j)` with side length `k`. Note that the side length `k` can be 0, which means the rhombus is just a single cell. 

Return an array of the biggest three distinct rhombus sums in descending order. If there are less than three distinct values, return all of them sorted in descending order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can side length `k` be negative?
   **A**: No, `k` should be a non-negative integer.

2. **Q**: Is it possible to have non-square grids?
   **A**: Yes, the grid can be any dimension `m x n`.

3. **Q**: Are there constraints on the values within the grid?
   **A**: Yes, typically values are within a reasonable range as per standard constraints in competitive programming.

4. **Q**: Can rhombus borders overlap each other when calculating sums?
   **A**: Yes, sums are independent and may overlap in their calculations.

### Strategy

1. **Single Point Rhombuses:** First, consider the smallest rhombus which is just a single point (side length `k = 0`). Directly collect all unique cell values as they are minimal rhombus sums.
   
2. **Larger Rhombuses:** For each cell `(i, j)` in the grid, consider rhombuses centered at `(i, j)` with increasing side lengths. Ensure the rhombus does not go out of grid boundaries.

   - Compute the sums for the borders of each rhombus.
   - Use a set to keep track of unique sums to avoid duplicates.
   - Maintain a max-heap to keep the highest three sums efficiently.

### Code Implementation

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int[] getBiggestThree(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;
        Set<Integer> uniqueSums = new HashSet<>();

        // We'll collect all rhombus sums.
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                // Single point rhombus
                uniqueSums.add(grid[i][j]);
                
                // Rhombuses with side length >= 1
                int k = 1;
                while (i - k >= 0 && i + k < m && j - k >= 0 && j + k < n) {
                    int sum = 0;
                    // Add top and bottom parts
                    for (int z = 0; z < k; z++) {
                        sum += grid[i - z][j + k - z]; // Top right diagonal
                        sum += grid[i + z][j - k + z]; // Bottom left diagonal
                        sum += grid[i - k + z][j - z]; // Top left diagonal
                        sum += grid[i + k - z][j + z]; // Bottom right diagonal
                    }
                    // Correcting corners being added twice
                    sum -= grid[i - k][j];
                    sum -= grid[i][j + k];
                    sum -= grid[i + k][j];
                    sum -= grid[i][j - k];
                    uniqueSums.add(sum);
                    k++;
                }
            }
        }

        // Create a max heap to get the three largest unique sums
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        maxHeap.addAll(uniqueSums);

        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < 3 && !maxHeap.isEmpty(); i++) {
            result.add(maxHeap.poll());
        }

        // Convert List to array
        return result.stream().mapToInt(i -> i).toArray();
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(m * n * min(m, n)^2)
  - For each cell `(i, j)`, in the worst case we examine all possible rhombuses centered at `(i, j)`, which involves summing over `min(m, n)` elements along the borders.
  - Building the heap and extracting the top three elements involve log operations which are dominated by the grid traversal.

- **Space Complexity:** O(m * n)
  - To store unique sums in a set. The space for the heap is constant (at most 3 elements).

This solution efficiently collects the biggest three distinct rhombus sums and accounts for all possible rhombus configurations within the grid.
