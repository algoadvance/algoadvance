[Leetcode 1250. Check If It Is a Good Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1250)
## Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` of positive integers. Your task is to check if you can select any non-empty subarray and, after multiplying its elements by some integer, get an array in which all elements are equal to `1`.

More formally, if for any subarray `nums[l:r]` (where `l <= r`), you can find an integer `k` such that for every `i`, `nums[i] * k = 1`, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the array contain negative numbers or zeroes?**
    - No, all elements in the array are positive integers.

2. **What is the minimum length of the array?**
    - The array will have at least one element.

3. **Do we need to consider performance constraints?**
    - Yes, the solution should be efficient for larger input sizes.

## Strategy
To determine if we can convert the subarray's elements to `1` by multiplying their product by some integer `k`, we need to involve the concept of the greatest common divisor (GCD). 

Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. **GCD Insight**: If the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the entire array is `1`, then it's possible to form `1` by multiplying the entire array's product by some integer `k`.
2. **Using GCD**: Compute the GCD of all elements in the array. If the GCD of the array elements is `1`, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

The intuition is derived from number theory where a set of integers can only generate the number `1` through linear combinations if their GCD is `1`.

## Code
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class GoodArrayChecker {

    public static boolean isGoodArray(int[] nums) {
        int gcd = nums[0];
        for (int num : nums) {
            gcd = gcd(gcd, num);
            if (gcd == 1) return true; // Early exit if GCD becomes 1
        }
        return gcd == 1;
    }

    private static int gcd(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            int temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums1 = {12, 5, 7, 23};
        System.out.println(isGoodArray(nums1)); // Output: true

        int[] nums2 = {29, 6, 10};
        System.out.println(isGoodArray(nums2)); // Output: true

        int[] nums3 = {3, 6, 9};
        System.out.println(isGoodArray(nums3)); // Output: false
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **GCD Calculation**: The GCD computation for two numbers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm takes `O(log(min(a,b)))` time.
- **Overall Complexity**: As we compute the GCD for an array of size `n`, the overall time complexity is:
  - `O(n * logM)` where `M` is the maximum value in `nums`.

This ensures the solution is efficient even for large size arrays.
