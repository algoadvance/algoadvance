[Leetcode 1466. Reorder Routes to Make All Paths Lead to the City Zero](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1466)
## Problem Statement
You are given `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n-1` and `n-1` roads represented by `connections` where `connections[i] = [a, b]` represents a bidirectional road that connects cities `a` and `b`. You need to re-order the directions of some roads such that each city can be accessed from the city `0`. Return the minimum number of edges that need to be reversed.

## Clarifying Questions
Before we proceed to the solution, here are some questions to clarify the problem:
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the range of `n`?
     - Typically, `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5` as it involves cities.
   - What guarantees that the input forms a tree?
     - The problem ensures that we are provided with a tree structure.

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Should the return value be the number of edges that need to be reversed to ensure all cities are accessible from city `0`?

If these constraints and conditions are satisfied, I will proceed with the strategy and solution.

## Strategy
1. **Graph Construction**:
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the graph. This will include both the directions provided and the reverse edges for easy traversal.

2. **DFS/BFS Traversal**:
   - We will perform a traversal (DFS or BFS) starting from city `0`. As we traverse, if an edge from the current city does not point towards the child city, it means we need to reverse this direction.

3. **Count Reversals**:
   - While traversing, keep a count of the number of edges that needed to be reversed.

The overall approach involves visiting each city once and selectively counting the misoriented edges.

## Code
Here is the Java solution implementing the above strategy:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int minReorder(int n, int[][] connections) {
        // Adjacency list representation of the graph
        ArrayList<int[]>[] graph = new ArrayList[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        
        // Fill the graph adjacency list
        for (int[] connection : connections) {
            int u = connection[0];
            int v = connection[1];
            // Add forward edge with an indicator 1
            graph[u].add(new int[]{v, 1});
            // Add backward edge with an indicator 0
            graph[v].add(new int[]{u, 0});
        }

        // Perform DFS to count the reordering
        return dfs(graph, 0, new boolean[n]);
    }
    
    private int dfs(ArrayList<int[]>[] graph, int node, boolean[] visited) {
        visited[node] = true;
        int changeCount = 0;
        
        for (int[] neighbor : graph[node]) {
            int nextNode = neighbor[0];
            int needsReversal = neighbor[1];
            if (!visited[nextNode]) {
                // If we need to reverse this edge
                changeCount += needsReversal;
                // Recur for the next node
                changeCount += dfs(graph, nextNode, visited);
            }
        }
        
        return changeCount;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Building the Adjacency List**:
  - This involves processing each connection once, resulting in `O(n)` time complexity.
  
- **DFS Traversal**:
  - Each node and edge is traversed exactly once, so the DFS traversal is `O(n)`.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n)` due to the linear traversal of each node and edge once.

This approach is efficient and suitable for the problem constraints.
