[Leetcode 1448. Count Good Nodes in Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1448)
## Problem Statement

In this problem, you're given the root of a binary tree. A node X in the binary tree is named a good node if in the path from the root to X there are no nodes with a value greater than X.

You need to return the number of good nodes in the binary tree.

**Example 1:**

Input: root = [3,1,4,3,null,1,5]

Output: 4

Explanation: Nodes in blue are good nodes.

- Root Node (3) is always a good node.
- Node 4 -> (3 → 4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
- Node 5 -> (3 → 4 → 5) is the maximum value in the path
- Node 3 -> (3 → 1 → 3) is the maximum value in the path.

**Example 2:**

Input: root = [3,3,null,4,2]

Output: 3

Explanation: Nodes in blue are good nodes.

- Root Node (3) is always a good node.
- Node 4 -> (3 → 3 → 4) is the maximum value in the path starting from the root.
- Node 3 -> (3 → 3) is the maximum value in the path.

**Example 3:**

Input: root = [1]

Output: 1

Explanation: Root is considered as good.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is it guaranteed that the tree node values are unique?**
   - No, tree node values are not necessarily unique.

2. **Can the tree be empty?**
   - It is given that we're provided `root`, so it cannot be empty in this context.

3. **What is the range of the node values?**
   - The values of the nodes are within the range of `[-10^4, 10^4]`.

4. **What is the maximum depth of the tree?**
   - The tree's maximum depth is given by the problem constraints on LeetCode, typically around `1000` nodes for binary trees.

## Strategy

1. We'll perform a Depth First Search (DFS) traversal of the binary tree.
2. We'll keep track of the maximum value encountered from the root to the current node.
3. If the current node's value is greater than or equal to the maximum value on the path from the root, it is a good node.
4. Update the maximum value on the path while traversing to the children nodes.
5. Count and return the total number of good nodes.

## Code

Here's how to implement the solution:

```java
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
}

public class Solution {
    public int goodNodes(TreeNode root) {
        return dfs(root, Integer.MIN_VALUE);
    }
    
    private int dfs(TreeNode node, int maxVal) {
        if (node == null) return 0;
        
        int goodNodesCount = 0;
        if (node.val >= maxVal) {
            goodNodesCount++;
            maxVal = node.val; // Update the maxVal
        }
        
        goodNodesCount += dfs(node.left, maxVal);
        goodNodesCount += dfs(node.right, maxVal);
        
        return goodNodesCount;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)` where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(H)` where `H` is the height of the tree. This is the space used by the call stack during the DFS, which in the worst case (for an unbalanced tree) can be equal to `N`. For a balanced tree, `H` would be `log(N)`.
