[Leetcode 2316. Count Unreachable Pairs of Nodes in an Undirected Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2316)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n`. There is an undirected graph with `n` nodes, numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are also given a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [aᵢ, bᵢ]` denotes that there exists an undirected edge connecting nodes `aᵢ` and `bᵢ`.

Return the number of pairs of different nodes that are unreachable from each other.

### Example:

**Input:**
```
n = 3
edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2]]
```

**Output:**
```
0
```

**Explanation:**
There are no pairs of different nodes that are unreachable from each other.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are the edges bi-directional?
   **A:** Yes, as it is an undirected graph.

2. **Q:** Can there be duplicate edges in the input?
   **A:** No, all edges are unique in the provided input.

3. **Q:** Can `n` be zero?
   **A:** No, the constraints assure `1 <= n <= 10^5`.

4. **Q:** Are all nodes from `0` to `n-1` guaranteed to be present?
   **A:** Yes, nodes are numbered sequentially from `0` to `n-1`.

## Strategy

1. **Graph Representation:** Use an adjacency list to represent the graph.
2. **Connected Components Identification:** Use a Depth-First Search (DFS) to identify all connected components in the graph.
3. **Count Unreachable Pairs:** For each pair of connected components, calculate the number of unreachable pairs using combinatorics.

### Steps:

1. **Build the graph** using an adjacency list from the given edge list.
2. **Use DFS or BFS** to find and count the size of each connected component.
3. **Calculate the total number of unreachable pairs:**

    Given sizes of connected components `c1, c2, ..., ck`:
    
    Total pairs = (sum of all pairs) - (reachable pairs):
    
    Total pairs: `n * (n - 1) / 2`
    
    Reachable pairs: Sum of `ci * (ci - 1) / 2` for each component.

### Code Implementation

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public long countUnreachablePairs(int n, int[][] edges) {
        // Step 1: Create an adjacency list
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            graph.get(edge[0]).add(edge[1]);
            graph.get(edge[1]).add(edge[0]);
        }
        
        // Step 2: Find all connected components using DFS
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        List<Integer> componentSizes = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                int size = dfs(graph, visited, i);
                componentSizes.add(size);
            }
        }
        
        // Step 3: Calculate the number of unreachable pairs
        long totalPairs = ((long) n * (n - 1)) / 2;
        long reachablePairs = 0;
        
        for (int size : componentSizes) {
            reachablePairs += ((long) size * (size - 1)) / 2;
        }
        
        return totalPairs - reachablePairs;
    }

    private int dfs(List<List<Integer>> graph, boolean[] visited, int node) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        stack.push(node);
        visited[node] = true;
        int size = 0;
        
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            int current = stack.pop();
            size++;
            
            for (int neighbor : graph.get(current)) {
                if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                    visited[neighbor] = true;
                    stack.push(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return size;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Graph Construction:** `O(E + V)` where `E` is the number of edges and `V` is the number of vertices.
2. **DFS Traversal:** `O(E + V)` to identify connected components.
3. **Computation of Unreachable Pairs:** `O(C)` where `C` is the number of connected components, typically `C <= V`.

Overall Time Complexity: `O(E + V)`
