[Leetcode 1455. Check If a Word Occurs As a Prefix of Any Word in a Sentence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1455)
### Problem Statement:
Given a sentence that consists of some words separated by a single space, and a searchWord, you need to check if the searchWord is a prefix of any word in the sentence. Return the index of the word (1-indexed) where searchWord is a prefix. If there is no such word, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What is the range of the length of the sentence and searchWord?**
   The sentence and searchWord lengths can both be reasonably large, say up to 3000 characters.
   
2. **Are there any special characters in the input?**
   The sentence will contain only lowercase English letters and spaces. The searchWord will also contain only lowercase English letters.

3. **What if the searchWord is empty?**
   Given the problem constraints, the searchWord will always be a non-empty string.

4. **What should be the return value if there is no word in the sentence?**
   Since this scenario is unlikely with the problem constraints (words separated by spaces), you should return -1.

### Strategy:
1. **Split the Sentence:**
   Split the sentence into an array of words using space as the delimiter.
   
2. **Iterate through the Words:**
   Use a loop to check each word in the array to see if it starts with the searchWord.

3. **Return the Index:**
   Since the requirement is to return a 1-indexed position, adjust the index accordingly, and return -1 if no such prefix exists.

### Code:
Here is the Java implementation of the solution:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int isPrefixOfWord(String sentence, String searchWord) {
        String[] words = sentence.split(" ");
        
        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            if (words[i].startsWith(searchWord)) {
                return i + 1; // converting 0-index to 1-index
            }
        }
        
        return -1; // if no word is found with the given prefix
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Splitting the Sentence:** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the sentence.
- **Checking Each Word for the Prefix:** Consider `m` to be the average length of a word. For each word in the sentence, checking if it starts with the searchWord is `O(m)`, and given there are `k` words, the overall complexity for this check is `O(k * m)`.

The overall time complexity is `O(n + k * m)`, but since `k * m` is essentially the length of the sentence (`n`), the final complexity remains `O(n)`.

The space complexity is also `O(n)` due to the storage of the words array.
