[Leetcode 1585. Check If String Is Transformable With Substring Sort Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1585)
### Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `t` of the same length, you must transform `s` into `t` using the following operations:
1. Choose any substring of `s` and sort it in non-decreasing order. A substring is defined as a contiguous sequence of characters within the string.

Return `true` if `s` can be transformed into `t` using the above operations, and `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Will the strings `s` and `t` always consist of digits only?
   - **A:** Yes, the problem statement indicates that `s` and `t` are composed of digits.

2. **Q:** Do `s` and `t` always have the same length?
   - **A:** Yes, the problem ensures that both strings have the same length.

3. **Q:** Can we assume `t` is valid, i.e., can we assume `t` can be obtained by some sequence of allowed operations?
   - **A:** We will assume `t` can be potentially formed by some sequences of operations. We need to verify it by checking the conditions.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to ensure that any substring sorting operation allows for `s` to morph into `t`. Key insight is to check the relative order of characters in `s` and `t`.

1. **Frequency Matching**: First, check if `s` and `t` have the same character counts. If they don't, immediately return `false`.

2. **Relative Positioning**: For each character in `t`, ensure that any character in `s` that is smaller than this character and appears earlier can be "sorted past" it.

Here is a more detailed step-by-step strategy:

1. Iterate through characters of `t` from left to right.
2. For each character in `t`, find its occurrences in `s` while ensuring that no smaller character disrupts the ability to sort this part of `s` to match `t`.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public boolean isTransformable(String s, String t) {
        // If lengths are different, they can't be transformed
        if (s.length() != t.length()) return false;
        
        // Create queues for each digit 0-9
        Queue<Integer>[] indices = new Queue[10];
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            indices[i] = new LinkedList<>();
        }
        
        // Populate the queues with indices of each digit in the string s
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            indices[s.charAt(i) - '0'].offer(i);
        }
        
        // Check each character in t
        for (int i = 0; i < t.length(); i++) {
            int digit = t.charAt(i) - '0';
            
            // If the desired digit's queue is empty, return false
            if (indices[digit].isEmpty()) return false;
            
            // Get the smallest index of the current digit
            int index = indices[digit].poll();
            
            // Ensure no smaller digit comes after the current index in s and before current index in t
            for (int j = 0; j < digit; j++) {
                if (!indices[j].isEmpty() && indices[j].peek() < index) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`:

1. **Queue Initialization**: Creating ten queues takes constant time `O(1)`.
2. **Populating Queues**: Populating each queue by iterating through `s` takes `O(n)`.
3. **Transform Check**: Iterating through `t` and performing checks also takes `O(n)`.

Thus, overall, the solution runs in linear time `O(n)`.
