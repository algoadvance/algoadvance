[Leetcode 2684. Maximum Number of Moves in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2684)
## Problem Statement

You are given a grid of size `m x n` where each cell contains a positive integer denoting the cost of stepping into that cell. Initially, you are in the top-left cell (0, 0) and you need to move to the bottom-right cell (m-1, n-1). From any cell (i, j), you can move to the following cells:

1. (i+1, j)
2. (i, j+1)

You need to find the maximum number of cells you can move through as you traverse from the top-left cell to the bottom-right cell, avoiding cells with a higher cost than the current cell.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we assume that there is always a valid path from the top-left to the bottom-right?**
   - Yes, there will always be a valid path.

2. **Are there constraints on the grid dimensions `(m, n)`?**
   - Yes, typically constraints are provided. Let's assume `1 <= m, n <= 1000`.

3. **What are the range of values for the cost in each cell?**
   - Assume the cost in each cell is a positive integer and fits within a reasonable range for typical computation, e.g., `1 <= cost <= 1000`.

## Code
Let's write the code to solve this problem.


```java
public class MaximumMovesGrid {

    public static int maxMoves(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        int[][] dp = new int[m][n];

        // Initialize the starting point
        dp[0][0] = 1;

        // Fill the rest of the DP table
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i > 0 && grid[i][j] >= grid[i-1][j]) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i-1][j] + 1);
                }
                if (j > 0 && grid[i][j] >= grid[i][j-1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i][j-1] + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // The result is stored in the bottom-right cell
        return dp[m-1][n-1];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[][] grid = {
            {1, 2, 3},
            {4, 5, 6},
            {7, 8, 9}
        };
        System.out.println(maxMoves(grid)); // Output should be the maximum number of moves possible
    }
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - We'll maintain a `dp` table where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of moves possible to reach cell (i, j) starting from (0, 0).

2. **Initialization**:
   - Start by initializing `dp[0][0]` as `1` because we are starting from there.

3. **Iteration**:
   - For each cell (i, j), check the two possible previous cells it could have come from: `(i-1, j)` and `(i, j-1)`.
   - Only update `dp[i][j]` if the cost condition is satisfied (i.e., the current cell cost is greater than or equal to the previous cell cost).

4. **Final Value**:
   - The bottom-right cell `dp[m-1][n-1]` will contain the answer, which is the maximum number of moves possible.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n) since we are iterating over each cell in the grid exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) for the `dp` table.

This approach ensures that we compute the maximum number of moves efficiently using dynamic programming.
