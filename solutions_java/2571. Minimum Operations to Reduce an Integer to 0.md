[Leetcode 2571. Minimum Operations to Reduce an Integer to 0 full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2571)
### Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer `n`. You can perform the following operations on `n` any number of times:

1. If `n` is even, divide it by `2`.
2. If `n` is odd, subtract `1` from it.

Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to reduce `n` to `0`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the range of `n`? (Assuming `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9` based on usual constraints)
2. **Edge Cases**:
    - What if `n` is already `0`? (Should return `0` operations)
    - What if `n` is already `1`? (One subtraction operation needed)

### Strategy

1. **Check for Even/Odd**:
    - If `n` is even, divide by 2. This reduces the number rapidly.
    - If `n` is odd, subtract 1 to make it even.

2. **Steps**:
    - Initialize a counter to keep track of the number of operations.
    - Use a loop to keep performing the above operations until `n` becomes `0`.
    - For each step, if `n` is even, update `n` to `n / 2`, else update `n` to `n - 1`.
    - Increment the operations counter for each loop iteration.

### Time Complexity

- The loop runs logarithmically with respect to `n` because each division by 2 operation halves `n`.
- Therefore, the time complexity is O(log n).

### Code

```java
public class MinimumOperations {
    public int minOperations(int n) {
        int operations = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            if (n % 2 == 0) {
                n /= 2;
            } else {
                n -= 1;
            }
            operations++;
        }
        return operations;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumOperations mo = new MinimumOperations();
        int n = 18; // Example input
        int result = mo.minOperations(n);
        System.out.println("Minimum operations to reduce " + n + " to 0: " + result);
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **Initialization**: Start with `operations` set to `0`.
- **Loop**:
    - Check if `n` is even. If true, divide `n` by `2`.
    - If `n` is odd, subtract `1` from `n`.
    - Increment the `operations` counter in each iteration.
- **Termination**: The loop runs until `n` is reduced to `0`, ensuring the minimum number of operations is counted.

This approach ensures that we take the most logical step at each point to minimize the number of operations and efficiently reduce `n` to `0`.
