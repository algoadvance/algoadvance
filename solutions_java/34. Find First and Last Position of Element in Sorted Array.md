[Leetcode 34. Find First and Last Position of Element in Sorted Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l34)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, find the starting and ending position of a given target value. If the target is not found in the array, return `[-1, -1]`.

You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.

### Example:
```java
Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 8
Output: [3,4]

Input: nums = [5,7,7,8,8,10], target = 6
Output: [-1,-1]

Input: nums = [], target = 0
Output: [-1,-1]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are the array elements always integers?
   - Yes.
2. Can the array be empty?
   - Yes.
3. Is the target value always an integer?
   - Yes.

## Strategy
1. We need to find the first and last positions of the target.
2. We will use binary search, leveraging the fact that the array is sorted, to achieve `O(log n)` complexity.
3. We will perform two binary searches: 
   - One to find the first occurrence of the target.
   - One to find the last occurrence of the target.

### Steps:
1. Implement a helper function `findFirstPosition` that performs binary search to find the first position of the target.
2. Implement a helper function `findLastPosition` that performs binary search to find the last position of the target.
3. If the target is not present, both functions should return `-1`.
4. Return the results in an array `[firstPosition, lastPosition]`.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] searchRange(int[] nums, int target) {
        int firstPos = findFirstPosition(nums, target);
        int lastPos = findLastPosition(nums, target);
        return new int[]{firstPos, lastPos};
    }

    private int findFirstPosition(int[] nums, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;
        int result = -1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                result = mid;
                right = mid - 1;  // Move left to find the first occurrence
            } else if (nums[mid] < target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }

    private int findLastPosition(int[] nums, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;
        int result = -1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                result = mid;
                left = mid + 1;  // Move right to find the last occurrence
            } else if (nums[mid] < target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- Each binary search (for the first and last positions) runs in `O(log n)` time.
- Therefore, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is `O(log n) + O(log n) = O(log n)`.

This approach ensures that we satisfy the requirements of optimal time complexity for this problem.
