[Leetcode 829. Consecutive Numbers Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l829)
### Problem Statement

Given a positive integer `n`, return the number of ways `n` can be written as the sum of consecutive positive integers.

**Example:**
```
Input: n = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: 5 = 5 = 2 + 3
```

**Example:**
```
Input: n = 9
Output: 3
Explanation: 9 = 9 = 4 + 5 = 2 + 3 + 4
```

**Example:**
```
Input: n = 15
Output: 4
Explanation: 15 = 15 = 7 + 8 = 4 + 5 + 6 = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of n**: What is the expected range of the input integer `n`? 
   - **Answer**: The input `n` should be a positive integer, and constraints are generally up to 10^9 based on typical Leetcode problems.
   
2. **Allowable integer types**: Should the sum consist only of positive integers?
   - **Answer**: Yes, the problem explicitly states that the sum must consist of positive integers only.

3. **Output type**: Can the output be a simple integer count of the number of ways?
   - **Answer**: Yes, return the count of possible ways `n` can be expressed as the sum of consecutive positive integers.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, let's break it down:

1. **Mathematical Formulation**: 
   - Consider `n` can be written as the sum of `k` consecutive integers starting from `a`.
   - The sequence would be: `a, a+1, a+2, ..., a+(k-1)`.
   - The sum of this sequence can be represented by the formula:
     \[
     n = a + (a+1) + (a+2) + ... + (a+(k-1)) = k \times a + \frac{k \times (k-1)}{2}
     \]
     Simplifying this, 
     \[
     n = \frac{k \times (2a + k - 1)}{2}
     \]
   - Rearrange this to:
     \[
     2n = k \times (2a + k - 1)
     \]
   - We need to find values of `k` that make the right-hand side an integer.

2. **Iteration**: 
   - Iterate over potential values of `k` from 1 upwards and check if for each `k`, `2n` is divisible by `k`. 
   - For each valid `k` that satisfies the divisibility, there is one solution for `a`.

   - `k` has a limit for potential values because `a` must be positive, i.e., `2a + k - 1 >= k` =>
   - Therefore, \(k \cdot (k-1) < 2n\).

### Code

```java
public class ConsecutiveNumbersSum {
    public int consecutiveNumbersSum(int n) {
        int count = 0;
        int upperLimit = (int)(Math.sqrt(2 * n + 0.25) - 0.5);

        for (int k = 1; k <= upperLimit; ++k) {
            // Check if 2n is divisible by k
            if ((2 * n) % k == 0) {
                // Check if the resulting a is a positive integer
                int a2 = 2 * n / k + 1 - k;
                if (a2 > 0 && a2 % 2 == 0) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ConsecutiveNumbersSum solution = new ConsecutiveNumbersSum();
        System.out.println(solution.consecutiveNumbersSum(5));  // Output: 2
        System.out.println(solution.consecutiveNumbersSum(9));  // Output: 3
        System.out.println(solution.consecutiveNumbersSum(15)); // Output: 4
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The loop runs until `sqrt(2n)`, thus the time complexity is \( O(\sqrt{n}) \).

The proposed solution efficiently computes the number of ways to express `n` as the sum of consecutive integers by leveraging mathematical properties and reducing the problem's scope to an \( O(\sqrt{n}) \) complexity.
