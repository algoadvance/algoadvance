[Leetcode 508. Most Frequent Subtree Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l508)
### Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, return the most frequent subtree sum. If there is a tie, return all the values with the highest frequency in any order.

The subtree sum of a node is the sum of all the node values formed by the subtree rooted at that node (including the node itself).

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be returned if there are multiple subtree sums with the same highest frequency?**
   - Return all the values with the highest frequency in any order.
   
2. **Can the tree contain negative values?**
   - Yes, the tree can contain negative values.

3. **What should be done if the tree is empty?**
   - If the tree is empty, the result should be an empty list.

4. **Are there any constraints on the size of the tree?**
   - Typically, you can assume the height of the tree to be manageable within the typical constraints of memory and stack size (~10^4 nodes).

### Strategy
1. **Post-order Traversal:** Use post-order traversal to calculate the sum of each subtree.
2. **Tracking Frequencies:** Use a HashMap to track the frequency of each subtree sum.
3. **Finding Most Frequent:** Identify the maximum frequency from the HashMap and collect all sums that have this frequency.
4. **Base Case:** Handle the case where the tree is empty by returning an empty list.

### Code
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    private Map<Integer, Integer> sumFrequency;
    private int maxFrequency;

    public int[] findFrequentTreeSum(TreeNode root) {
        sumFrequency = new HashMap<>();
        maxFrequency = 0;

        postOrderTraversal(root);

        List<Integer> mostFrequentSums = new ArrayList<>();
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : sumFrequency.entrySet()) {
            if (entry.getValue() == maxFrequency) {
                mostFrequentSums.add(entry.getKey());
            }
        }

        return mostFrequentSums.stream().mapToInt(i -> i).toArray();
    }

    private int postOrderTraversal(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int leftSum = postOrderTraversal(node.left);
        int rightSum = postOrderTraversal(node.right);
        int totalSum = node.val + leftSum + rightSum;

        sumFrequency.put(totalSum, sumFrequency.getOrDefault(totalSum, 0) + 1);
        maxFrequency = Math.max(maxFrequency, sumFrequency.get(totalSum));

        return totalSum;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once during the traversal.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N) for storing the frequency of each possible subtree sum in the HashMap and for the recursion stack in the worst case (i.e., height of the tree).
