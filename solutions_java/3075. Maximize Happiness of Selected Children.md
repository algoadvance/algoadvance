[Leetcode 3075. Maximize Happiness of Selected Children](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3075)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of integers representing the happiness of each child. You are also given an integer `k` representing the number of children you need to select. Your goal is to maximize the total happiness of the selected children while ensuring that no two selected children have adjacent indices.

Return the maximum sum of the happiness values of the selected children.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Values:**
   - What are the possible ranges for the happiness values? (positive/negative/zero)
   - What are the maximum values for the length of the list and `k`?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should be returned if `k=0` or the list is empty?
   - Is it always guaranteed that we can select `k` non-adjacent children?

### Sample Input/Output

Example 1:
- Input: `happiness = [1, 2, 3, 4], k = 2`
- Output: `6` (Selecting happiness values 1 and 3 or 2 and 4)

Example 2:
- Input: `happiness = [7, -1, 5, 2, -3, 8], k = 3`
- Output: `20` (Selecting happiness values 7, 5, and 8)

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can employ a dynamic programming approach similar to the "house robber" problem. Hereâ€™s the approach in detail:

1. **Dynamic Programming State Definition:**
   - We define a 2D DP array `dp[i][j]`, where `i` indicates the end index of the array considered, and `j` indicates the number of selected children.
   - `dp[i][j]` will store the maximum happiness sum we can obtain by selecting `j` children from the first `i` elements in the list.

2. **State Transition:**
   - If we don't select the `i-th` child: `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]`
   - If we select the `i-th` child: `dp[i][j] = happiness[i] + dp[i-2][j-1]` (since we cannot take `i-1`-th child)

3. **Base Cases:**
   - `dp[i][0] = 0` for all `i` (choosing 0 children yields 0 happiness)
   - `dp[0][1] = happiness[0]` if `k >= 1`

4. **Final Answer:**
   - The answer will be the maximum value in `dp[n-1][k]` where `n` is the length of the happiness array.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this approach is `O(n*k)`, where `n` is the length of the happiness array, and `k` is the number of children to select.
- The space complexity is also `O(n*k)` for the DP table.

### Code

```java
public class MaximizeHappiness {

    public int maximizeHappiness(int[] happiness, int k) {
        int n = happiness.length;
        
        // Edge cases
        if (k == 0) return 0;
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        if (k > (n + 1) / 2) return -1;  // when it's not possible to select k non-adjacent children
        
        // Initialize dp array
        int[][] dp = new int[n][k + 1];
        
        // Base cases
        dp[0][1] = happiness[0];
        for (int j = 2; j <= k; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
                // Not selecting i-th child
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
                // Selecting i-th child
                if (i - 2 >= 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], happiness[i] + dp[i - 2][j - 1]);
                } else if (j == 1) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], happiness[i]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        int result = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            result = Math.max(result, dp[i][k]);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximizeHappiness mh = new MaximizeHappiness();
        int[] happiness = {7, -1, 5, 2, -3, 8};
        int k = 3;
        System.out.println(mh.maximizeHappiness(happiness, k));  // Output: 20
    }
}
```

This code leverages dynamic programming to solve the problem of selecting non-adjacent `k` children to maximize their combined happiness.
