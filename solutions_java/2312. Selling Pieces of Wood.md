[Leetcode 2312. Selling Pieces of Wood](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2312)
Certainly, I'll guide you through the process step-by-step for solving Problem 2312: Selling Pieces of Wood. Let's break it down:

### Problem Statement
You have a piece of wood of size `m x n`. You can sell a piece of wood of size `i x j` for `prices[i-1][j-1]` dollars. You can cut the piece of wood either vertically or horizontally to sell smaller pieces. Your goal is to find the maximum revenue you can achieve by selling the wood in any possible way.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What are the constraints on `m` and `n`? (Typical constraints will be useful to decide on an approach, especially considering dynamic programming solutions)
   - Are there any constraints on `prices` values?

2. **Cuts and Calculations**:
   - Can a piece of wood be sold without making any cuts?
   - Can multiple smaller pieces be assembled to maximize the price strategically?

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. Hereâ€™s a proposed strategy:

1. **Dynamic Programming Table**:
   - Create a DP table `dp[m+1][n+1]`.
   - `dp[i][j]` will represent the maximum revenue achievable for a piece of wood of size `i x j`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - The base cases will be directly derived from the `prices` array.

3. **Filling the DP Table**:
   - For every sub-piece size `i x j`:
     - Consider selling the piece directly for `prices[i-1][j-1]`.
     - Iterate over all possible horizontal cuts and calculate the maximum revenue.
     - Iterate over all possible vertical cuts and calculate the maximum revenue.
     - Use the previously computed sub-problems to get the maximum possible revenue after the cut.

4. **Final Answer**:
   - The value at `dp[m][n]` will be the maximum revenue for the given piece of wood.

### Code
Here's the Java implementation for the stated approach:

```java
public class Solution {
    public long sellingWood(int m, int n, int[][] prices) {
        long[][] dp = new long[m + 1][n + 1];
        
        // Initialize dp table
        for (int[] price : prices) {
            int height = price[0];
            int width = price[1];
            int value = price[2];
            dp[height][width] = value;
        }

        // Fill the dp table
        for (int i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                // Try all vertical cuts
                for (int k = 1; k < i; k++) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[k][j] + dp[i - k][j]);
                }
                // Try all horizontal cuts
                for (int k = 1; k < j; k++) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[i][j - k]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // The answer is the maximum revenue for the whole piece
        return dp[m][n];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) for the DP table.
- **Time Complexity**: For each cell `dp[i][j]`:
  - Calculations involve two nested loops for possible cuts: vertical (up to `i` times) and horizontal (up to `j` times).
  - This results in an overall complexity of O(m * n * (m + n)).

In conclusion, the primary challenge lies in adequately filling the DP table by considering all possible subproblems, which is effectively handled by the nested loops structured in the solution.
