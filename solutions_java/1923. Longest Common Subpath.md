[Leetcode 1923. Longest Common Subpath](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1923)
## Problem Statement

Given `n` cities represented as a 2D list `paths` where `paths[i]` is a list of integers representing a path through cities that starts at city 0, return the maximum length of a subpath that appears in all paths.

A subpath is a path that appears as a subarray (consecutive elements) in all the given paths.

### Example

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 5, paths = [[1,2,3,4],[3,4,0,1,2,3,4],[3,4,2,3,4]]
Output: 2
Explanation: The longest common subpath is [3,4]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints:**
   - What are the constraints on the size of `n` and the length of `paths[i]`?
   
2. **Input Validity:**
   - Are all paths non-empty and do they start from city 0?

3. **Uniqueness:**
   - Do the paths contain unique cities, or can there be repetitions within a single path?

## Strategy

We need to find the longest subpath that is present in all lists of paths. This can be solved through a combination of binary search and hashing.

1. **Binary Search:** Use binary search on the potential lengths of the common subpath.
2. **Hashing:** Use hashing to efficiently check if a subpath of a given length appears in all paths.

### Steps:
1. **Binary Search on Lengths:**
   - Set the initial boundaries for binary search: `low = 1` and `high = length of the shortest path in paths`.
   - For each mid-point in the binary search, verify if there's a common subpath of length `mid` using hashing.
   
2. **Hashing to Check Subpath:**
   - Use a rolling hash (like Rabin-Karp's hash) to get hash values for subpaths. This helps in efficient subpath comparison.

3. **Validation Function:**
   - For each mid-length, generate and store hashes of subpaths of that length for the first path.
   - Check each subsequent path against these stored hashes to see if a common subpath of length `mid` exists.

This approach combines the power of binary search to reduce the problem space with the efficiency of hashing to check subpath equivalence.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class LongestCommonSubpath {
    public int longestCommonSubpath(int n, int[][] paths) {
        int minLen = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int[] path : paths) {
            minLen = Math.min(minLen, path.length);
        }

        int left = 1, right = minLen;
        
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = (left + right + 1) / 2;
            if (hasCommonSubpath(paths, mid)) {
                left = mid; // Try for a larger length
            } else {
                right = mid - 1; // Reduce the length
            }
        }
        
        return left; 
    }
    
    private boolean hasCommonSubpath(int[][] paths, int length) {
        Set<Long> commonHashes = null;
        final long BASE = 2305843009213693951L;
        
        for (int[] path : paths) {
            Set<Long> currentHashes = new HashSet<>();
            long hash = 0, power = 1;
            
            for (int i = 0; i < path.length; ++i) {
                hash = hash * 256 + path[i];
                
                if (i >= length - 1) {
                    if (i >= length) {
                        hash -= path[i - length] * power;
                    } else {
                        power *= 256;
                    }
                    
                    currentHashes.add(hash);
                }
            }
            
            if (commonHashes == null) {
                commonHashes = currentHashes;
            } else {
                commonHashes.retainAll(currentHashes);
            }
            
            if (commonHashes.isEmpty()) {
                return false; // If there's no common subpath of this length
            }
        }
        
        return !commonHashes.isEmpty();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LongestCommonSubpath solution = new LongestCommonSubpath();
        int[][] paths = // use example above
        int n = 5;
        System.out.println(solution.longestCommonSubpath(n, paths)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Binary Search:** O(log(minLen)), where minLen is the length of the shortest path in `paths`.
2. **Hashing to Check Subpath:**
   - Each hashing operation roughly O(m) where m is the average length of the paths.
   - In the worst case, we compute hashes up to `log(minLen)` times.

Thus, the overall time complexity is approximately O(k * m * log(minLen)), where k is the number of paths and m is the average length of paths.

This approach should be efficient for reasonably sized input constraints.
