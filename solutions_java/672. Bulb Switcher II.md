[Leetcode 672. Bulb Switcher II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l672)
### Problem Statement
You have `n` bulbs in a row numbered from `1` to `n`. Initially, all the bulbs are turned on. You can perform exactly one of four operations any number of times:

1. Toggle all the bulbs.
2. Toggle every second bulb.
3. Toggle every third bulb.
4. Toggle the bulbs with positions `1 + 3k`, for all integers `k` (turning on the bulbs in positions 1, 4, 7, ...).

You will return the number of different states after performing any number of operations.

### Clarifying Questions
To understand the problem fully, here are some clarifying questions:

1. **Q**: What does "toggle" mean in the context of this problem?
   - **A**: Toggling a bulb means if it is currently on (1), turn it off (0), and if it is currently off, turn it on.

2. **Q**: Are all bulbs initially turned on?
   - **A**: Yes, all bulbs start in the on position (1).

3. **Q**: What inputs are provided?
   - **A**: Two integers, `n` (number of bulbs) and `m` (the number of operations that can be performed).

### Strategy
Let's break down how we can approach this problem:

1. **Understand Bulb States**: Each bulb can be either on or off, and specific operations toggle groups of bulbs.
2. **Pattern Observation**: Given the constraints, we can find a pattern rather than simulating all operations which would be costly. Analyzing small values of `n` and `m` can help us deduce a pattern.
3. **Configuration Combinations**: Depending on the value of `n` and `m`, the number of unique configurations can be fairly small. This results from the overlaps and redundancies of multiple operations.

**Special Cases**:
1. If `n == 0`, there are no bulbs and hence `0` states.
2. If `m == 0`, there is only one state where all bulbs are on.
3. For larger values of `n` and `m`, configurations become a combination of the toggling operations.

### Code
Below is the Java implementation of the logic described:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int flipLights(int n, int m) {
        // Reduce problem size based on observation
        // States only depend on the first 6 bulbs effectively due to repeatable pattern
        if (n > 6) n = 6;
                    
        // Special case handling based on observed pattern
        if (m == 0) return 1;
        if (n == 1) return 2;
        if (n == 2 && m == 1) return 3;
        if (n == 2) return 4;
        if (m == 1) return 4;
        if (m == 2) return 7;
        
        return 8;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(1), which is constant time. This is due to straightforward conditional checks that only evaluate a static number of conditions without looping or recursion.

The approach relies heavily on observed patterns rather than simulating the operation for every possible bulb and operation configuration, which offers a highly optimized solution in constant time.

By breaking down the problem and focusing on small-scale insights, this solution effectively leverages pattern recognition to offer a practical and efficient solution.
