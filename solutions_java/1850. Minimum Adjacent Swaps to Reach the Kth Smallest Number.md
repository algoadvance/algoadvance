[Leetcode 1850. Minimum Adjacent Swaps to Reach the Kth Smallest Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1850)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `num`, representing a large integer, and an integer `k`. The task is to return the minimum number of adjacent swaps required to transform the integer represented by `num` into the k-th smallest number that can be formed with its digits.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What is the length range for the string `num`?
    - What is the range of the integer `k`?
  
2. **Output:**
    - Are there constraints on the maximum number of swaps allowed?
  
3. **Behavior:**
    - Should the function account for edge cases such as when the string is already the smallest possible permutation, or k equals zero?

## Code

Assuming input constraints are as follows:
- The length of `num` is at most 1000.
- `k` is a positive integer within a feasible range.

Here is the code implementation:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MinimumAdjacentSwaps {
    
    public int getMinSwaps(String num, int k) {
        char[] arr = num.toCharArray();
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            getNextPermutation(arr);
        }
        String kthSmallest = new String(arr);
        return countSwaps(num, kthSmallest);
    }
    
    private void getNextPermutation(char[] arr) {
        int i = arr.length - 2;
        while (i >= 0 && arr[i] >= arr[i + 1]) {
            i--;
        }
        if (i >= 0) {
            int j = arr.length - 1;
            while (arr[j] <= arr[i]) {
                j--;
            }
            swap(arr, i, j);
        }
        reverse(arr, i + 1);
    }
    
    private void swap(char[] arr, int i, int j) {
        char temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[j];
        arr[j] = temp;
    }
    
    private void reverse(char[] arr, int start) {
        int end = arr.length - 1;
        while (start < end) {
            swap(arr, start, end);
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }
    
    private int countSwaps(String num, String target) {
        int swaps = 0;
        char[] arr1 = num.toCharArray();
        char[] arr2 = target.toCharArray();
        for (int i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
            if (arr1[i] != arr2[i]) {
                int j = i;
                while (arr1[j] != arr2[i]) {
                    j++;
                }
                while (j > i) {
                    swap(arr1, j, j - 1);
                    swaps++;
                    j--;
                }
            }
        }
        return swaps;
    }
    
    private void swap(char[] arr, int i, int j) {
        char temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[j];
        arr[j] = temp;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumAdjacentSwaps sol = new MinimumAdjacentSwaps();
        System.out.println(sol.getMinSwaps("5489355142", 4)); // expected output: 2
        System.out.println(sol.getMinSwaps("11112", 4)); // expected output: 4
        System.out.println(sol.getMinSwaps("00123", 1)); // expected output: 1
    }
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Get the k-th Smallest Permutation:**
   - Use the `getNextPermutation` function to iteratively find the next lexicographical permutation of the given number `k` times.

2. **Count Minimum Swaps:**
   - Starting from the original string `num`, perform adjacent swaps to transform it into the k-th permutation obtained above.
   - For each character, if it is not in the correct position in the resultant permutation, find its position, then swap adjacent characters until it is in the correct place. Track the number of swaps.

## Time Complexity

1. **Finding k-th Permutation:**
   - Finding the next permutation takes \(O(n)\) time where \(n\) is the length of the string. Repeating this \(k\) times results in \(O(k \cdot n)\) time.
  
2. **Counting Swaps:**
   - In the worst case, for each character, we might need to perform \(O(n)\) swaps. This results in \(O(n^2)\) swaps for transforming the entire string.

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(k \cdot n + n^2)\). Given the constraints, this would be performant within the typical input size ranges.
