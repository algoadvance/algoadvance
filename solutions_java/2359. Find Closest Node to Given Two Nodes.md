[Leetcode 2359. Find Closest Node to Given Two Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2359)
### Problem Statement

You are given a directed graph of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` with `edges[i]` representing a directed edge from the node `i` to `edges[i]`. There may be some nodes that do not have outgoing edges. Your task is to find the closest meeting node for two given nodes, `node1` and `node2`. The closest meeting node is the node that minimizes the maximum of the distances from `node1` and `node2` to this node. If there are multiple such nodes, return the node with the smallest index. If no such node exists, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Graph Type**: Is it possible to have cycles in the graph?
   - Yes, cycles may exist since itâ€™s a directed graph, but you can reach each node at most once from any starting point due to the way the edges are presented.

2. **Input Constraints**: What are the constraints on the input size?
   - The number of nodes `n` is between `1` and `10^4`.
   - The value of each edge `edges[i]` is either between `-1` and `n-1`. A value of `-1` indicates that node `i` does not have an outgoing edge.

3. **Distance Metric**: How is the distance defined?
   - The distance is the number of edges traversed to get from one node to another.

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Use the provided edges array to represent the graph.

2. **Distance Calculation**:
   - For each of the given nodes (`node1` and `node2`), calculate the shortest distance from the node to all other nodes using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) because all edges have the same weight.

3. **Meeting Node Identification**:
   - Identify the node which minimizes the maximum distance from `node1` and `node2`. If multiple nodes have the same maximum distance, select the node with the smallest index.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Nodes that are disconnected or unreachable should be handled properly, typically initialized to a distance of infinity.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public class Solution {
    public int closestMeetingNode(int[] edges, int node1, int node2) {
        int n = edges.length;
        
        int[] distFromNode1 = new int[n];
        int[] distFromNode2 = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(distFromNode1, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        Arrays.fill(distFromNode2, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        
        // BFS to calculate distances from node1
        bfs(edges, node1, distFromNode1);

        // BFS to calculate distances from node2
        bfs(edges, node2, distFromNode2);

        // Find the minimum of the maximum distances
        int minDistance = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int resultNode = -1;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int maxDist = Math.max(distFromNode1[i], distFromNode2[i]);
            if (maxDist < minDistance) {
                minDistance = maxDist;
                resultNode = i;
            }
        }
        
        return resultNode;
    }
    
    private void bfs(int[] edges, int startNode, int[] distances) {
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(startNode);
        distances[startNode] = 0;
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int currentNode = queue.poll();
            int neighbor = edges[currentNode];
            if (neighbor != -1 && distances[neighbor] == Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
                distances[neighbor] = distances[currentNode] + 1;
                queue.offer(neighbor);
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **BFS Calculation**: The BFS runs in \(O(n)\) where `n` is the number of nodes since each node is visited once.
- **Finding Minimum Distance**: This also runs in \(O(n)\).

The overall time complexity is \(O(n)\).

This approach ensures that we efficiently identify the closest meeting node with respect to the given constraints.
