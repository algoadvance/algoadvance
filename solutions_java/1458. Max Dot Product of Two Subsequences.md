[Leetcode 1458. Max Dot Product of Two Subsequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1458)
### Problem Statement

The problem is taken from LeetCode and can be described as follows:

**1458. Max Dot Product of Two Subsequences**

Given two arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return the maximum dot product between **non-empty** subsequences of them.

A subsequence of a array is a new array which is formed from the original array by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., `[2,3,5]` is a subsequence of `[1,2,3,4,5]` while `[1,5,3]` is not).

The dot product of two arrays is the sum of the products of their corresponding elements.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums1 = [2,1,-2,5], nums2 = [3,0,-6]
Output: 18
Explanation: Take subsequence [2,5] from nums1 and subsequence [3,-6] from nums2.
The dot product will be (2*3 + 5*(-6)) = 6 + (-30) = -24. However, taking subsequence [2, 5] and subsequence [3,0] gives product 2*3 + 5*0 = 6.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums1 = [3,-2], nums2 = [2,-6,7]
Output: 21
Explanation: Take subsequence [3] from nums1 and subsequence [7] from nums2.
The dot product will be (3*7) = 21.
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 500`
- `-1000 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the subsequences be empty?**
   - No, the subsequences must be non-empty.
2. **Are the numbers allowed to be negative?**
   - Yes, the numbers can be negative which can affect the dot product calculation.

### Strategy

Given the constraints and requirements, a Dynamic Programming (DP) approach is suitable for solving this problem.
  
1. **DP Initialization**: Create a 2D DP table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will store the maximum dot product for the subarrays `nums1[0:i+1]` and `nums2[0:j+1]`.
2. **State Transition**:
   - `dp[i][j] = max(nums1[i] * nums2[j], nums1[i] * nums2[j] + dp[i-1][j-1], dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`
3. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - If `i == 0` and `j == 0`, we compute the dot product directly.
   - If `i == 0` or `j == 0`, the transitions depend solely on the single-row/column values.
4. **Result Calculation**: The entry `dp[n-1][m-1]` will hold the final value of the maximum dot product for the two sequences.

### Code

Here is a Java implementation of the described approach:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxDotProduct(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int n = nums1.length, m = nums2.length;
        int[][] dp = new int[n][m];
        
        dp[0][0] = nums1[0] * nums2[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = Math.max(dp[i-1][0], nums1[i] * nums2[0]);
        }
        for (int j = 1; j < m; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = Math.max(dp[0][j-1], nums1[0] * nums2[j]);
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < m; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], nums1[i] * nums2[j]);
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], nums1[i] * nums2[j] + dp[i-1][j-1]);
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n-1][m-1];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n \times m)\) where \(n\) and \(m\) are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2` respectively.
- The space complexity is also \(O(n \times m)\) due to the DP table.

This approach ensures that all possible subsequences are considered and the maximum dot product is calculated effectively.
