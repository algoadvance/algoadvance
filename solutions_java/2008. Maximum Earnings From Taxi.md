[Leetcode 2008. Maximum Earnings From Taxi](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2008)
## Problem Statement

You are a taxi driver, and you need to pick up passengers to maximize your earnings.

There are `n` passengers requesting to travel from `pickup[i]` to `drop[i]` with an earnings of `earnings[i]`. You are allowed to pick them up and drop them off in any order but cannot have more than one passenger in your taxi at any point in time.

Your task is to return the maximum amount of earnings you can achieve.

**Example:**

Given the following inputs:
- `pickup = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
- `drop = [5, 6, 7, 8]`
- `earnings = [10, 20, 30, 40]`

Output: `100`

**Constraints:**
- `n == pickup.length == drop.length == earnings.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= pickup[i], drop[i] <= 10^5`
- `1 <= earnings[i] <= 10^5`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the pickup and drop locations be the same? (Given the constraints, this may not be possible)
2. Is it guaranteed that all pickup and drop locations are distinct?
3. Can the pickups and drops be processed in any order, or do they need to follow a specific sequence?
4. What is the range of possible pickup, drop, and earnings values?
    - The values are large, ranging up to 10^5.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming (DP) approach combined with sorting and binary search:

1. **Sort the trips**: First, we will sort the trips by their drop-off times to ensure that at each step, we consider the earliest trip ending first.
2. **Dynamic Programming Array**: Use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum earnings if we consider up to the `i-th` trip.
3. **Binary Search for Non-Overlapping Trip**: For each trip `i`, find the latest trip `j` such that the `drop[j]` is less than or equal to `pickup[i]`. This can be efficiently done using binary search.
4. **Fill DP Array**: Iterate through each trip and update the DP array to reflect the maximum earnings considering whether to include the current trip or not.

## Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.TreeMap;

public class MaximumEarningsFromTaxi {
    
    static class Trip {
        int pickup, drop, earnings;
        
        Trip(int pickup, int drop, int earnings) {
            this.pickup = pickup;
            this.drop = drop;
            this.earnings = earnings;
        }
    }
    
    public int maxEarnings(int[] pickup, int[] drop, int[] earnings) {
        int n = pickup.length;
        Trip[] trips = new Trip[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            trips[i] = new Trip(pickup[i], drop[i], earnings[i]);
        }
        
        Arrays.sort(trips, (a, b) -> a.drop - b.drop);
        
        // TreeMap to store the running maximum earnings till each time point
        TreeMap<Integer, Integer> dp = new TreeMap<>();
        dp.put(0, 0);
        
        int maxEarnings = 0;
        
        for (Trip trip : trips) {
            int bestBeforePickup = dp.floorEntry(trip.pickup).getValue();
            int currentEarnings = bestBeforePickup + trip.earnings;
            maxEarnings = Math.max(maxEarnings, currentEarnings);
            dp.put(trip.drop, maxEarnings);
        }
        
        return maxEarnings;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximumEarningsFromTaxi solution = new MaximumEarningsFromTaxi();
        int[] pickup = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        int[] drop = {5, 6, 7, 8};
        int[] earnings = {10, 20, 30, 40};
        System.out.println(solution.maxEarnings(pickup, drop, earnings)); // Output: 100
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting the Trips**: `O(n log n)` due to the sorting operation.
- **Filling the DP Array**: `O(n log n)` because for each trip, we perform binary search operations using a TreeMap.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`, which is efficient given the constraints.

The space complexity is `O(n)` mainly for storing the trips and the TreeMap.
