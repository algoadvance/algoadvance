[Leetcode 1349. Maximum Students Taking Exam](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1349)
### Problem Statement

You are given a `m x n` binary matrix `seats` where `seats[i][j]` equals `0` represents an empty seat and `seats[i][j]` equals `1` represents a broken seat. You need to maximize the number of students that can take the exam in the exam room. The students must be placed such that no two students are adjacent, meaning they must follow these rules:

1. No two students should be in the same row that are directly next to each other.
2. No two students should be in the same column that are directly next to each other.

Return the maximum number of students that can take the exam.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Is the matrix size fixed or can it vary? 
     - The matrix size is not fixed and can vary.
   - What is the range of `m` and `n`?
     - Both `m` and `n` can range from 1 to 8.

2. **Output Specification**:
   - What should be the form of the output?
     - The output should be a single integer representing the maximum number of students that can take the exam.

### Strategy

1. **State Representation**:
   - Use a state to represent which seats are occupied in each row. There are `2^n` possible states for a row with n seats.

2. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Let DP[r][current_state] represent the maximum number of students up to row r with a specific seating configuration defined by `current_state`.

3. **Transition**:
   - For each row, iterate over all possible states.
   - Check all valid transitions from the previous rowâ€™s valid states to the current row's valid states.

4. **Validation**:
   - Ensure no two students are adjacent in the same row or column and no two students have invalid positions based on broken seats.

5. **Initial State**:
   - Initialize the states for the first row based on the available seats.

6. **Result Calculation**:
   - Iterate through all rows and calculate the valid configurations, updating the DP table accordingly.
   - The answer will be the maximum value in the last row's DP states.

### Code

Here is an implementation of the above strategy in Java:

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxStudents(char[][] seats) {
        int m = seats.length, n = seats[0].length;
        int[] validRows = new int[m];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            int rowMask = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (seats[i][j] == '.') {
                    rowMask |= (1 << j);
                }
            }
            validRows[i] = rowMask;
        }
        
        int[][] dp = new int[m][1 << n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            Arrays.fill(dp[i], -1);
        }
        
        for (int state = 0; state < (1 << n); state++) {
            if ((state & validRows[0]) == state && isValid(state, n)) {
                dp[0][state] = Integer.bitCount(state);
            }
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < m; i++) {
            for (int prevState = 0; prevState < (1 << n); prevState++) {
                if (dp[i-1][prevState] == -1) continue;
                
                for (int currState = 0; currState < (1 << n); currState++) {
                    if ((currState & validRows[i]) == currState && isValid(currState, n) && (currState & (prevState >> 1)) == 0 && (currState & (prevState << 1)) == 0) {
                        dp[i][currState] = Math.max(dp[i][currState], dp[i-1][prevState] + Integer.bitCount(currState));
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        int result = 0;
        for (int state = 0; state < (1 << n); state++) {
            result = Math.max(result, dp[m - 1][state]);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    private boolean isValid(int state, int n) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (((state >> i) & 1) == 1 && ((state >> (i + 1)) & 1) == 1) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **DP Table Construction**: The DP table has dimensions `m x (1 << n)`, so `O(m * 2^n)`.
- **State Iteration**: Transition between states involves checking all possible pairs of previous and current row states, requiring `O((2^n)^2)`.
- **Overall Complexity**: The overall complexity is `O(m * 2^n * 2^n) = O(m * 4^n)`. Given the constraints, this complexity is manageable.

### Summary
This solution employs dynamic programming with state representation to determine the maximum number of students that can be placed in the exam room adhering to the given constraints. The solution efficiently iterates through states ensuring valid student placement by checking against broken seats and adjacency rules in both rows and columns.
