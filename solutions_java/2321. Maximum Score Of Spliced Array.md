[Leetcode 2321. Maximum Score Of Spliced Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2321)
Sure, let's tackle LeetCode problem 2321: "Maximum Score Of Spliced Array". 

### Problem Statement

You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays, `nums1` and `nums2`, of length `n`.

- **score1** is the sum of the elements in `nums1`.
- **score2** is the sum of the elements in `nums2`.

You can choose two integers `left` and `right` (inclusive) in the range `[0, n-1]` and **swap** the subarray nums1[left:right+1] with the subarray nums2[left:right+1].

Return the maximum possible sum of score1 that can be obtained by executing at most one swap operation.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of numbers in the arrays?**
   - The elements in the arrays can be positive or negative integers, typically within the bounds defined by the problem constraints.

2. **What are the constraints on the values of `n`?**
   - The length of the arrays `n` is constrained by the problem and can range up to large values (e.g., 10000). This will guide our approach in terms of time complexity.

### Strategy

To solve this, note that swapping a subarray between `nums1` and `nums2` effectively means we are adding the increase/decrease in sum due to the swapped elements.

1. Calculate the initial scores `score1` and `score2`.
2. We can compute the difference array `diff[i] = nums2[i] - nums1[i]`. If we swap `nums1[left:right+1]` with `nums2[left:right+1]`, it maximizes `nums1`'s score by adding the sum of the differences in that range to `score1`.
3. To find the optimal subarray to swap, we need to find the maximum subarray sum of `diff` using Kadane's algorithm.

Using this approach allows us to determine the maximum increase in `score1` (or decrease if we did the opposite for `score2`).

### Code

Here's the Java solution to implement the strategy:

```java
public class MaximumScoreOfSplicedArray {
    public int maximumsSplicedArray(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int initialScore1 = 0, initialScore2 = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < nums1.length; i++) {
            initialScore1 += nums1[i];
            initialScore2 += nums2[i];
        }

        int maxIncreaseForScore1 = findMaxIncrease(nums2, nums1); // Max increase for score1 by swapping nums1 subarray with nums2
        int maxIncreaseForScore2 = findMaxIncrease(nums1, nums2); // Max increase for score2 by swapping nums2 subarray with nums1

        return Math.max(initialScore1 + maxIncreaseForScore1, initialScore2 + maxIncreaseForScore2); 
    }

    private int findMaxIncrease(int[] primary, int[] secondary) {
        int currentMax = 0, maxSoFar = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < primary.length; i++) {
            int diff = primary[i] - secondary[i];
            currentMax = Math.max(diff, currentMax + diff);
            maxSoFar = Math.max(maxSoFar, currentMax);
        }

        return maxSoFar;
    }

    // For testing purposes
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximumScoreOfSplicedArray solver = new MaximumScoreOfSplicedArray();
        int[] nums1 = {60, 60, 60};
        int[] nums2 = {10, 90, 10};
        System.out.println(solver.maximumsSplicedArray(nums1, nums2)); // Output: 210
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **O(n)**: The algorithm performs a single pass through the array to calculate the differences and find the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's algorithm. Thus, this is efficient and runs in linear time, making it suitable for large inputs as specified in the problem constraints.
