[Leetcode 1542. Find Longest Awesome Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1542)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s`. An `awesome` substring is a non-empty substring such that after reordering it can be made a palindrome. Return the length of the maximum length `awesome` substring of `s`.

Example:

- Input: s = "3242415"
- Output: 5
- Explanation: "24241" is the longest awesome substring, we can form the palindrome "24142".

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What characters can the string contain?**
   - The string `s` only contains digits from `'0'` to `'9'`.

2. **What is the length range of the string `s`?**
   - The length of `s` is between 1 and \(10^5\).

3. **What should be returned if there are multiple longest awesome substrings of the same length?**
   - Just return the length of one of them.

4. **Are there any additional constraints or special cases we need to account for?**
   - No additional constraints other than the size limits.

### Strategy

The key insight for solving this problem is understanding that a string can be rearranged into a palindrome if at most one character has an odd frequency. We can use bit manipulation to achieve this efficiently.

- Use a bitmask to keep track of odd/even counts for each digit (0-9). 
- Create a hash map to store the first occurrence of each possible bitmask.
- Iterate through the string, update the bitmask based on the current character, and check previous occurrences of the same or slightly different bitmasks (differing by one bit).

The algorithm steps are:

1. Initialize `currentMask` to 0 and a hash map `maskIndex` to store first occurrences of masks.
2. Loop through the string and update the mask for each character.
3. Check if the current mask or any mask with one bit different (up to one character's frequency toggled) was seen before.
4. Calculate the potential substring lengths and keep track of the longest one.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class LongestAwesomeSubstring {

    public int longestAwesome(String s) {
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> maskIndex = new HashMap<>();
        int maxLength = 0;
        int currentMask = 0;
        maskIndex.put(0, -1); // base case: mask 0 at index -1

        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            int digit = s.charAt(i) - '0';
            currentMask ^= (1 << digit);

            if (maskIndex.containsKey(currentMask)) {
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, i - maskIndex.get(currentMask));
            } else {
                maskIndex.put(currentMask, i);
            }

            for (int d = 0; d <= 9; d++) {
                int toggleMask = currentMask ^ (1 << d);
                if (maskIndex.containsKey(toggleMask)) {
                    maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, i - maskIndex.get(toggleMask));
                } 
            }
        }

        return maxLength;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LongestAwesomeSubstring solution = new LongestAwesomeSubstring();
        String s = "3242415";
        System.out.println(solution.longestAwesome(s)); // Output: 5
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n \cdot k)\)
  - \(n\) for iterating through the string
  - \(k\) is the number of digits (which is a constant, 10 in this case).

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(2^k)\)
  - \(2^k\) for the potential different bitmasks stored in the hash map (this is \(2^{10}\)).

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and works within the problem constraints.
