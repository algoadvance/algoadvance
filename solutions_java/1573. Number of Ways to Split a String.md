[Leetcode 1573. Number of Ways to Split a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1573)
### Problem Statement

You are given a binary string `s` (a string consisting only of '0's and '1's). You can split `s` into three non-empty substrings `s1`, `s2`, and `s3` such that:

* `s1 + s2 + s3 = s`

Return the number of ways `s` can be split such that the number of '1's is the same in `s1`, `s2`, and `s3`. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What is the expected length of the string `s`?
   **A:** The length of the string can be up to `10^5`.

2. **Q:** Can the string contain leading zeros?
   **A:** Yes, the string can contain leading zeros.

3. **Q:** What should be returned if there is no way to split the string satisfying the conditions?
   **A:** Return 0 in such a scenario.

4. **Q:** What are the constraints on the characters of the string `s`?
   **A:** The string `s` contains only the characters '0' and '1'.

### Strategy

1. **Counting Total Ones:** First, count the total number of '1's in the string. If this count is not divisible by 3, return 0 because it's impossible to split the string such that each part has an equal number of '1's.

2. **Finding Split Points:** If the total number of '1's, let's call it `total_ones`, is divisible by 3, each segment must have exactly `total_ones / 3` number of '1's. Let's denote this value as `k`.

3. **Identifying Valid Splits:**
   - Identify points in the string where the first segment can end and the second segment can start, ensuring that each segment has exactly `k` '1's.
   - Similarly, identify points where the second segment can end and the third segment can start.

4. **Counting Ways:**
   - Let `count1` be the number of ways we can place the first split point.
   - Let `count2` be the number of ways we can place the second split point after `count1`.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int numWays(String s) {
        final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;
        int length = s.length();
        int totalOnes = 0;

        // Count total number of '1's
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (ch == '1') {
                totalOnes++;
            }
        }

        // If total number of '1's is not divisible by 3, it's impossible to split
        if (totalOnes % 3 != 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        // If there are no '1's at all, we need to choose 2 split points from (length - 1) positions
        if (totalOnes == 0) {
            long ways = ((long)(length - 1) * (long)(length - 2) / 2) % MOD;
            return (int) ways;
        }

        // Each segment must have exactly k '1's
        int k = totalOnes / 3;
        int prefixOneCount = 0;

        // Variables to count valid splitting points
        long firstSplitWays = 0;
        long secondSplitWays = 0;

        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (ch == '1') {
                prefixOneCount++;
            }

            // When prefixOneCount is multiple of k
            if (prefixOneCount == k) {
                firstSplitWays++;
            }

            if (prefixOneCount == 2 * k) {
                secondSplitWays++;
            }
        }

        // Ways to place first split * ways to place second split
        long result = (firstSplitWays * secondSplitWays) % MOD;
        return (int) result;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** 
  - Counting the total number of '1's in the string takes \(O(n)\) time.
  - Finding valid split points also takes \(O(n)\) time.
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\).

- **Space Complexity:** 
  - The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This solution efficiently counts the valid splits and computes the answer modulo \(10^9 + 7\).
