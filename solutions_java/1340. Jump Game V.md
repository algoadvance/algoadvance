[Leetcode 1340. Jump Game V full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1340)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `arr` and an integer `d`. In one step you can move from index `i` to index `i + j` or index `i - j` where `1 <= j <= d` and `arr[i] > arr[i + j]` and `arr[i] > arr[i - j]`. In other words, you can jump to any index within the range `d` that has a smaller value than the current index.

You want to maximize the number of indices you can visit.

Return the maximum number of indices you can visit starting from any index.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: arr = [6,4,14,6,8,13,9,7,10,6,12], d = 2  
Output: 4
Explanation: You can start at index 10. You can then jump to index 8, to index 6, and to index 9. So, the maximum length of jump is 4.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are there constraints on the length of the `arr` and value of `d`?**
   - Typically, constraints exist to ensure the problem can be solved in reasonable time.
2. **Is it always possible to make a jump, or are there cases where no jumps are possible?**

### Strategy
1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Use a `dp` array where `dp[i]` represents the maximum number of indices that can be visited starting from index `i`.
   - Initialize a helper function `dfs(i)`, which will compute the maximum jump length starting from index `i`.
   - Traverse each index and use DFS to fill the `dp` array.
   - Use memoization to store already computed values in the `dp` array for performance improvement.
   - For each position, attempt jumping both left and right within the constraint `d`.

### Code
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class JumpGameV {
    public int maxJumps(int[] arr, int d) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(dp, -1);
        int maxJumps = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            maxJumps = Math.max(maxJumps, dfs(arr, dp, i, d));
        }
        
        return maxJumps;
    }
    
    private int dfs(int[] arr, int[] dp, int i, int d) {
        if (dp[i] != -1) {
            return dp[i];
        }
        
        int maxJumps = 1;
        int n = arr.length;
        
        // Jump to the right
        for (int jump = 1; jump <= d && i + jump < n && arr[i + jump] < arr[i]; jump++) {
            maxJumps = Math.max(maxJumps, 1 + dfs(arr, dp, i + jump, d));
        }
        
        // Jump to the left
        for (int jump = 1; jump <= d && i - jump >= 0 && arr[i - jump] < arr[i]; jump++) {
            maxJumps = Math.max(maxJumps, 1 + dfs(arr, dp, i - jump, d));
        }
        
        dp[i] = maxJumps;
        return dp[i];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JumpGameV game = new JumpGameV();
        int[] arr = {6,4,14,6,8,13,9,7,10,6,12};
        int d = 2;
        System.out.println(game.maxJumps(arr, d)); // Output: 4
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \cdot d)\), where \( n \) is the length of the array. Each element is computed once and each computation involves up to \( d \) checks.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) due to the `dp` array and function call stack in recursion (although the worst case stack depth will be \(O(n)\)).

This approach ensures that each possible jump is considered once and the results are cached for efficiency.
