[Leetcode 52. N full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l52)
## Problem Statement

The n-queens puzzle is the problem of placing `n` queens on an `n x n` chessboard such that no two queens attack each other.

Given an integer `n`, return the number of distinct solutions to the n-queens puzzle.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the limits on the value of `n`?
     - `1 <= n <= 9`
     
2. **Output:**
   - We only need to return the count of distinct solutions.
   
3. **Assumptions:**
   - A solution exists for all `n` in the given range.
   - The function should be efficient enough to handle the maximum input size.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a backtracking approach, which is a standard technique for constraint satisfaction problems like the N-Queens puzzle. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step strategy:

1. **Backtracking Approach:**
   - Use a recursive function to attempt to place queens row by row.
   - Maintain three boolean arrays to keep track of the attacks:
     - `cols`: Marks if a column is already occupied by a queen.
     - `d1`: Marks the "top-left to bottom-right" diagonals.
     - `d2`: Marks the "top-right to bottom-left" diagonals.
   - If placing a queen in the current row and column combination leads to a valid state, recurse to the next row.
   - If all rows are successfully populated, increment the solution count.
   - Backtrack by removing the queen and trying the next column position.

2. **Recursive Function:**
   - `placeQueens(int row, int n, boolean[] cols, boolean[] d1, boolean[] d2)`: Tries to place a queen in each column of the current row and then proceeds to the next row.

3. **Initialization:**
   - Start with the first row and an empty board.

4. **Termination:**
   - If all rows are populated without conflicts, count it as a valid solution.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    private int count = 0;

    public int totalNQueens(int n) {
        boolean[] cols = new boolean[n];
        boolean[] d1 = new boolean[2 * n];
        boolean[] d2 = new boolean[2 * n];

        placeQueens(0, n, cols, d1, d2);
        return count;
    }

    private void placeQueens(int row, int n, boolean[] cols, boolean[] d1, boolean[] d2) {
        if (row == n) {
            count++;
            return;
        }

        for (int col = 0; col < n; col++) {
            int id1 = col - row + n;
            int id2 = col + row;

            if (cols[col] || d1[id1] || d2[id2]) continue;

            cols[col] = true;
            d1[id1] = true;
            d2[id2] = true;
            placeQueens(row + 1, n, cols, d1, d2);

            // backtrack
            cols[col] = false;
            d1[id1] = false;
            d2[id2] = false;
        }
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Worst-case Time Complexity:** O(N!), where N is the number of queens. This is because in the worst case, you need to try every possible combination of queen placements.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N), due to the use of boolean arrays to keep track of column and diagonal occupancy. The recursion stack will also use O(N) space.
