[Leetcode 1338. Reduce Array Size to The Half](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1338)
### Problem Statement:

We are given an array `arr`. We need to remove the minimum number of elements from `arr` so that at least half of the elements are removed. We need to return the size of the set of elements that we need to remove to achieve this.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. Could the array contain negative numbers?
   - Yes, the array can contain negative numbers as there are no constraints against it.

2. Could the array be empty or contain a single element?
   - No, the input inevitably will have a size such that `arr.length >= 1`.

3. Is there any constraint on the element values?
   - No, the element values can be any integer.

4. How should the result be returned?
   - Return an integer representing the size of the set of elements removed.

### Strategy:

1. **Frequency Count**:
   - First, count the frequency of each element in the array.
   
2. **Sort Frequencies**:
   - Create a list that contains these frequencies. Sort this list in descending order.

3. **Remove Elements**:
   - Initialize variables to keep track of the number of elements removed and the count of different elements removed.
   - Iterate through the sorted list of frequencies, and keep removing elements until at least half of the original array size is removed.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Return the count of different elements required to remove at least half of the array.

### Time Complexity:

1. Counting frequencies has a time complexity of \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the size of the array.
2. Sorting the frequency list has a time complexity of \(O(m \log m)\) where \(m\) is the number of unique elements in the array.
3. Removing elements in the worst case involves iterating over all unique elements (though generally this part is fast).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n + m \log m)\).

### Code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class ReduceArraySizeToHalf {
    
    public int minSetSize(int[] arr) {
        // Step 1: Count frequency of each element
        Map<Integer, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (int num : arr) {
            frequencyMap.put(num, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        // Step 2: Place frequencies in a list and sort in descending order
        List<Integer> frequencies = new ArrayList<>(frequencyMap.values());
        frequencies.sort(Collections.reverseOrder());
        
        // Step 3: Start removing elements while keeping track of the number of removed elements
        int removedElements = 0;
        int requiredSize = arr.length / 2;
        int setSize = 0;
        
        for (int freq : frequencies) {
            removedElements += freq;
            setSize++;
            if (removedElements >= requiredSize) {
                return setSize;
            }
        }
        
        return setSize; // This should never be reached due to problem constraints
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ReduceArraySizeToHalf solution = new ReduceArraySizeToHalf();
        int[] arr = {3,3,3,3,5,5,5,2,2,7};
        System.out.println(solution.minSetSize(arr)); // Expected output: 2
    }
}
```

This implementation fits the strategy, addressing the problem efficiently. Feel free to test with other input arrays to verify the solution.
