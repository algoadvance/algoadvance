[Leetcode 1436. Destination City](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1436)
### Problem Statement

You are given the array `paths`, where `paths[i] = [cityA_i, cityB_i]` means there exists a direct path going from `cityA_i` to `cityB_i`. Where `cityA_i` is the starting point and `cityB_i` is the destination.

Return the destination city, that is, the city without any path outgoing from it.

It is guaranteed that the graph of paths forms a line without any loop, therefore, there will be exactly one destination city.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: paths = [["London","New York"],["New York","Lima"],["Lima","Sao Paulo"]]
Output: "Sao Paulo"
Explanation: Starting at "London" city you will reach "Sao Paulo" city which has no outgoing path.
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can paths contain duplicate city names (i.e., different routes starting from or leading to the same city)?
   - Each city name is unique in terms of its role on the graph.
2. What is the maximum length of `paths`?
   - The maximum length of `paths` can typically be assumed to be 100.

### Strategy
1. Given that the paths form a straight line and there's only one destination city, we need to identify the city that does not appear as a starting city in any of the given paths.
2. We can utilize a set to track all the starting cities.
3. Iterate through the given paths to populate this set.
4. Once we have the set of all starting cities, the destination city will be the one that is not in this starting set but appears as an ending city in one of the paths.

### Code
```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Set;

public class Solution {
    public String destCity(List<List<String>> paths) {
        Set<String> startingCities = new HashSet<>();
        
        // Add all starting cities to the set
        for (List<String> path : paths) {
            startingCities.add(path.get(0));
        }
        
        // Check each ending city to see if it's not in the set of starting cities
        for (List<String> path : paths) {
            String endCity = path.get(1);
            if (!startingCities.contains(endCity)) {
                return endCity;
            }
        }
        
        // The problem guarantees there will always be a destination city,
        // so it's safe to return null or a default value here.
        return null;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of paths. This is because we iterate through the paths list twice: once to populate the set of starting cities, and once to determine the destination city.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), for storing the set of starting cities. In the worst case, the number of unique starting cities can be equal to the number of paths.
