[Leetcode 2079. Watering Plants](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2079)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array `plants` of `n` non-negative integers, each representing the amount of water a plant needs. An integer `capacity` is given, representing the maximum amount of water you can carry at a time. Starting with a full watering can at position `-1`, you will perform the watering process. The task is to compute the total number of steps you will take (both forward to the plant and if necessary, back to the river to refill water) in order to water all the plants.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the capacity be less than any plant's required water?
   **A:** No, you can assume that `capacity` is sufficient to water any single plant at a time.
   
2. **Q:** Do we count the steps only while walking between plants and river?
   **A:** Yes, steps to move forward and to refill are counted, not the watering process itself.

3. **Q:** Is the array `plants` guaranteed to have at least one plant?
   **A:** Yes, you can assume that the array `plants` has at least one element.

### Strategy
1. **Initialization**:
   - Start with `steps = 0`.
   - Start with `current_water = capacity`.

2. **Iterate through plants**:
   - For each plant, check if the current amount of water (`current_water`) can water it.
   - If yes, water the plant, decrement the amount needed from `current_water`, and move to the next plant.
   - If no, go back to the start (increment steps by the distance traveled back and forth), refill the can, and continue to the current plant position.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int wateringPlants(int[] plants, int capacity) {
        int steps = 0;
        int currentWater = capacity;
        int n = plants.length;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (currentWater >= plants[i]) {
                // Water this plant
                currentWater -= plants[i];
                steps++; // Move to the next plant
            } else {
                // Go back to the river and refill
                steps += (2 * i); // Move back to the river and then come back
                currentWater = capacity - plants[i]; // Refill and water the current plant
                steps++;  // Move to the next plant
            }
        }
        return steps;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of plants. This is because we iterate through the array of plants once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, since we only use a constant amount of extra space for variables such as `steps` and `currentWater`.

By implementing this strategy, we efficiently calculate the minimum number of steps required to water all the plants based on the given capacity of the watering can.
