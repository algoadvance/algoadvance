[Leetcode 2538. Difference Between Maximum and Minimum Price Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2538)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array representing the prices of certain products. You need to find the difference between the maximum and minimum price sum for a subarray of the given prices. A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the maximum length of the array?
2. **Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the values within the array (e.g., negative values, upper and lower bounds)?
3. **Output**: Should the output always be non-negative?
4. **Subarrays**: Are single-element subarrays considered as valid subarrays?

With these assumptions in mind, let's move forward with the solution.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will adopt the following strategy:

1. **Key Observation**: 
   - The difference between the maximum price sum and the minimum price sum subarray can be simply calculated as `maxPriceSum - minPriceSum`.
   
2. **Kadane's Algorithm**: 
   - Use Kadane's Algorithm to find the sum of the maximum subarray.
   - Modify Kadane's Algorithm to find the sum of the minimum subarray by inverting the sign of each element in the array and then applying Kadane's Algorithm, and finally inverting the result sum back.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Implement a helper function to find the maximum subarray sum using Kadane's Algorithm.
   - Implement another helper function by modifying Kadane’s Algorithm to find the minimum subarray sum.
   - Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum subarray sums.
   - Return the absolute value of the difference to ensure non-negative output.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxSubarraySum(int[] prices) {
        int currentMax = prices[0];
        int globalMax = prices[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            currentMax = Math.max(prices[i], currentMax + prices[i]);
            if(currentMax > globalMax) {
                globalMax = currentMax;
            }
        }
        
        return globalMax;
    }
    
    public int minSubarraySum(int[] prices) {
        int currentMax = -prices[0];
        int globalMax = -prices[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            currentMax = Math.max(-prices[i], currentMax - prices[i]);
            if(currentMax > globalMax) {
                globalMax = currentMax;
            }
        }
        
        return -globalMax;
    }
    
    public int maxMinDifference(int[] prices) {
        int maxSum = maxSubarraySum(prices);
        int minSum = minSubarraySum(prices);
        return Math.abs(maxSum - minSum);
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] prices = {1, -2, 3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4};
        System.out.println(sol.maxMinDifference(prices)); // Example usage
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Kadane's Algorithm for Maximum Subarray Sum**: O(n)
- **Kadane’s Modified Algorithm for Minimum Subarray Sum**: O(n)

Hence, the overall time complexity is **O(n)** where **n** is the length of the array.

### Summary

- We use Kadane's Algorithm to determine the maximum subarray sum.
- By inverting the elements, we apply a similar strategy to find the minimum subarray sum.
- The difference between these sums, giving the desired result, is computed efficiently within linear time complexity.
