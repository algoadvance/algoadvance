[Leetcode 1895. Largest Magic Square](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1895)
### Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` integer grid, a magic square is a `k x k` subgrid that contains all the integers in the range `[1, k^2]` in a certain arrangement such that:

- The sum of the elements in each row, columns, and both diagonals all are the same.
- You should also return the maximum possible integer `k` for which there is any `k x k` magic square subgrid in the input grid.

**Constraints:**
- The number of rows `m` and columns `n` will be in the range `[1, 50]`.
- Each element in the grid will be in the range `[0, 10^6]`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is `k` guaranteed to be at least 1?**
   - Yes, `k` will be at least 1 because the smallest possible grid is `1 x 1`.

2. **Are there any specific restrictions on the allowed values within the grid?**
   - No specific restrictions apart from the given range `[0, 10^6]`.

3. **Should the elements in the subgrid be distinct?**
   - No, the problem does not require the elements to be distinct. The problem only requires the sums of rows, columns, and diagonals in the subgrid to be the same.

### Strategy
1. **Iterate for Possible `k`:**
   - Start with the largest possible `k` and iterate downwards to check for a valid magic square.
   
2. **Sliding Window Approach:**
   - For each starting cell `(i, j)` in the grid, check if a `k x k` subgrid starting from that cell meets the conditions.
   
3. **Sum Check:**
   - Calculate the sum of the first row and use it as the reference sum.
   - Check if all rows, all columns, and both main diagonals of the subgrid equal to the reference sum.

4. **Optimization:**
   - Early exit if the sum of a particular row, column, or diagonal does not match the reference sum.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int largestMagicSquare(int[][] grid) {
        int m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;
        int maxK = Math.min(m, n);
        
        for (int k = maxK; k > 0; k--) {
            if (isMagicSquarePossible(grid, m, n, k)) {
                return k;
            }
        }
        
        return 1; // at least a 1x1 magic square is always there.
    }
    
    private boolean isMagicSquarePossible(int[][] grid, int m, int n, int k) {
        for (int i = 0; i <= m - k; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= n - k; j++) {
                if (isMagicSquare(grid, i, j, k)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    private boolean isMagicSquare(int[][] grid, int row, int col, int k) {
        int[] rowSum = new int[k];
        int[] colSum = new int[k];
        int diag1Sum = 0, diag2Sum = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            diag1Sum += grid[row + i][col + i];
            diag2Sum += grid[row + i][col + k - 1 - i];
            for (int j = 0; j < k; j++) {
                rowSum[i] += grid[row + i][col + j];
                colSum[j] += grid[row + i][col + j];
            }
        }
        
        int targetSum = rowSum[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < k; i++) {
            if (rowSum[i] != targetSum || colSum[i] != targetSum) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        if (diag1Sum != targetSum || diag2Sum != targetSum) {
            return false;
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Outer loop for `k`:** Runs from the maximum possible `k` to 1 (at most 50 iterations as maximum grid size is 50).
- **Checking each subgrid:** 
  - Takes `O(m * n)` in worst case to find the subgrids.
  - For each subgrid, takes `O(k^2)` to check the sums.
- **Overall Complexity:** `O(50 * m * n * k^2)` where `m` and `n` are the dimensions of the grid, and `k` can go up to 50.

However, this is manageable given the constraints.
