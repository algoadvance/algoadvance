[Leetcode 2920. Maximum Points After Collecting Coins From All Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2920)
### Problem Statement

You are given an n-ary tree where each node contains some coins. The goal is to maximize the number of coins you can collect by visiting all nodes, starting from the root. The tree is rooted at node `0`. The nodes are represented by a list of integers `coins` where `coins[i]` is the number of coins at node `i`. The tree is represented as a tree structure provided to you. 

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What is the maximum number of nodes in the tree?
   **A:** The maximum number of nodes can be up to `10^5`.

2. **Q:** How are the tree edges provided?
   **A:** The edges of the tree could be provided as a list of tuples where each tuple represents an edge between two nodes.

3. **Q:** Is the operation to collect coins from a node once or can we revisit nodes?
   **A:** You can collect coins from a node only once.

### Strategy

1. **Tree Traversal:** Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree starting from the root node.
2. **Coin Collection:** Accumulate the number of coins as you traverse each node.
3. **Recursive Approach:** Within DFS, recursively get the maximum coins from child subtrees.

### Code

Here's a Java solution to traverse the tree and calculate the maximum coins possible.

```java
import java.util.*;

class MaximumCoins {
    public int maxCoins(int[] coins, List<List<Integer>> edges) {
        int n = coins.length;
        List<List<Integer>> tree = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            tree.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }

        for (List<Integer> edge : edges) {
            int u = edge.get(0);
            int v = edge.get(1);
            tree.get(u).add(v);
            tree.get(v).add(u);
        }
        
        return dfs(0, -1, coins, tree);
    }

    private int dfs(int node, int parent, int[] coins, List<List<Integer>> tree) {
        int maxCoins = 0;

        for (int child : tree.get(node)) {
            if (child != parent) {
                maxCoins += dfs(child, node, coins, tree);
            }
        }

        return coins[node] + maxCoins;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximumCoins solution = new MaximumCoins();
        int[] coins = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        List<List<Integer>> edges = new ArrayList<>();
        edges.add(Arrays.asList(0, 1));
        edges.add(Arrays.asList(1, 2));
        edges.add(Arrays.asList(1, 3));
        
        int result = solution.maxCoins(coins, edges);
        System.out.println("Maximum coins collected: " + result);  // Output: 10
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes. Each node and edge is visited once in the DFS traversal.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` due to the recursion stack and the tree adjacency list representation.

This approach ensures that you are able to traverse all nodes efficiently and gather the maximum number of coins.
