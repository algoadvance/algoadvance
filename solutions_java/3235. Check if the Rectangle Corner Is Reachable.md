[Leetcode 3235. Check if the Rectangle Corner Is Reachable](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3235)
### Problem Statement

Given a grid of integers `mat` where `mat[i][j]` represents the cost to step on the cell `(i, j)`, determine if it's possible to reach the bottom-right corner from the top-left corner `(0, 0)` without passing through any cell with a cost of `0`. You can only move either down or right at any cell.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: mat = [[1, 2, 0], [0, 3, 4], [7, 0, 5]]
Output: False
Explanation: It is impossible to reach (2, 2) from (0, 0) because there is zero cost path blocking way.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: mat = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]
Output: True
Explanation: All paths from (0, 0) to (2, 2) are valid.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can `mat` have only one cell?
   - Yes, if `mat` only has the top-left corner cell and its value is non-zero, the output should be `True`.
   
2. What should we return if the input matrix is empty?
   - Return `False` if the matrix is empty.
   
3. What are the constraints on the size of the matrix and the values in `mat`?
   - We assume the dimensions of `mat` are reasonably small, so a standard BFS or DFS approach will work without performance bottlenecks.

### Strategy

We will use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse the grid because BFS explores all possible paths in level order, which is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid.

Steps:
1. Initialize a queue to begin from the top-left corner `(0, 0)`.
2. Use a set to keep track of visited cells to avoid reprocessing the same cell multiple times.
3. For each cell, attempt to move right and down. If either of these moves are within the grid bounds and lead to a cell with a non-zero cost, add that cell to the queue for further exploration.
4. If we reach the bottom-right corner, return `True`.
5. If the queue is exhausted and we haven't reached the target cell, return `False`.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public boolean isReachable(int[][] mat) {
        int rows = mat.length;
        if (rows == 0) return false;

        int cols = mat[0].length;
        if (cols == 0) return false;

        if (mat[0][0] == 0 || mat[rows - 1][cols - 1] == 0) return false;

        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(new int[]{0, 0});
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[rows][cols];
        visited[0][0] = true;

        int[][] directions = // use example from above

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] current = queue.poll();
            int r = current[0];
            int c = current[1];

            if (r == rows - 1 && c == cols - 1) {  // Reached bottom-right corner
                return true;
            }

            for (int[] dir : directions) {
                int newRow = r + dir[0];
                int newCol = c + dir[1];

                if (newRow < rows && newCol < cols && mat[newRow][newCol] != 0 && !visited[newRow][newCol]) {
                    queue.add(new int[]{newRow, newCol});
                    visited[newRow][newCol] = true;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    // Main function for testing
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[][] mat1 = {
                {1, 2, 0},
                {0, 3, 4},
                {7, 0, 5}
        };
        System.out.println(sol.isReachable(mat1));  // Output: false
        
        int[][] mat2 = {
                {1, 2, 3},
                {4, 5, 6},
                {7, 8, 9}
        };
        System.out.println(sol.isReachable(mat2));  // Output: true
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the BFS algorithm in this case is `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the matrix. Each cell is processed at most once. Checking neighbors take constant time per cell, resulting in linear time complexity with respect to the number of cells in the matrix.

The space complexity is also `O(m * n)` due to the queue and the visited array.
