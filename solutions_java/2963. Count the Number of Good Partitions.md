[Leetcode 2963. Count the Number of Good Partitions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2963)
Sure, letâ€™s walk through solving the problem step by step.

## Problem Statement:

Given an integer array `nums`, partition it into two (non-empty) subsets, such that the sum of the minimum value in each subset is at least a given integer `k`. Return the number of ways to partition `nums` into these two subsets. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. What values can the elements of `nums` take? (Assume any integer)
2. Can `nums` contain duplicate values? (Assume yes)
3. Are there any constraints on the size of `nums`?
4. What is the range of `k`?
5. Can we have negative numbers in `nums`?

### Assumptions:
1. The array `nums` can have both positive and negative integers.
2. The length of `nums` is `n` and `1 <= n <= 2000`.
3. The value of `k` is an integer and can be negative, zero, or positive.

### Strategy:

1. **Initial Sorting**: 
   - Sort the array `nums`.
2. **Two Pointer Technique**:
   - Use a two-pointer technique to find all pairs `(left, right)` where `nums[left]` and `nums[right]` are the minimum values of two subsets respectively.
   - Start the left pointer at the beginning and the right pointer from the end.
   - Increment left and decrement right based on the condition if `nums[left] + nums[right] >= k`.
3. **Counting Valid Partitions**:
   - Each position of the left pointer `l` (before the right pointer) forms a valid partition if `nums[l] + nums[r] >= k`.

### Code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class GoodPartitions {
    private static final int MOD = 1000000007;

    public int countGoodPartitions(int[] nums, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(nums); // Step 1: Sort the array
        int left = 0, right = nums.length - 1;
        long count = 0;

        // Two pointer approach
        while (left < right) {
            if (nums[left] + nums[right] >= k) {
                // All pairs (left, right), (left + 1, right), ..., (right - 1, right)
                count = (count + (right - left)) % MOD;
                right--; // Move the right pointer leftwards
            } else {
                left++; // Move the left pointer rightwards
            }
        }

        return (int) count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        GoodPartitions gp = new GoodPartitions();
        
        // Example Usage
        int[] nums = {4, 3, 2, 5, 7};
        int k = 8;
        System.out.println(gp.countGoodPartitions(nums, k)); // Output will vary based on `nums` and `k`
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Sorting**: `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the length of the array `nums`.
- **Two-pointer traversal**: `O(n)`, as each pointer moves across the entire array once.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step.

This solution effectively counts the number of valid partitions that satisfy the given conditions by leveraging sorting and a two-pointer technique, making it both efficient and straightforward.
