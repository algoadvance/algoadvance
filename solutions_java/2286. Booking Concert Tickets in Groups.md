[Leetcode 2286. Booking Concert Tickets in Groups](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2286)
## Problem Statement

You are developing a system for booking concert tickets. The system should be able to handle multiple requests for booking tickets in various groups. Each concert has a specified number of seats arranged in continuous rows.

Design a `BookMyShow` class:
- `BookMyShow(int n, int m)`: Initializes the object with `n` rows and `m` seats per row.
- `int[] gather(int k, int maxRow)`: Try to gather `k` consecutive seats in the same row, up to `maxRow`. If successful, return an array `[row, seat]`, indicating the row and the starting seat number; otherwise, return an empty array `[]`.
- `boolean scatter(int k, int maxRow)`: Try to scatter `k` seats across rows, up to `maxRow`. Return `true` if it is possible to scatter the seats; otherwise, return `false`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Seats Arrangement**: Are the seats within a row indexed from 0 through `m-1`?
2. **Input Constraints**: What are the constraints on `n`, `m`, and `k`? 

## Code
```java
import java.util.*;

class BookMyShow {
    private int n, m;
    private int[] seatsLeft; // To track the number of available seats in each row.

    public BookMyShow(int n, int m) {
        this.n = n;
        this.m = m;
        this.seatsLeft = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(this.seatsLeft, m); // Initialize all rows with m seats available.
    }

    public int[] gather(int k, int maxRow) {
        // Try to find the first row up to maxRow that can accommodate k consecutive seats.
        for (int row = 0; row <= maxRow; row++) {
            if (seatsLeft[row] >= k) {
                // Found a suitable row, book the seats.
                int startSeat = m - seatsLeft[row];
                seatsLeft[row] -= k;
                return new int[]{row, startSeat};
            }
        }
        return new int[0]; // No such row found.
    }

    public boolean scatter(int k, int maxRow) {
        int seatsRequired = k;
        for (int row = 0; row <= maxRow; row++) {
            if (seatsLeft[row] > 0) {
                if (seatsLeft[row] >= seatsRequired) {
                    seatsLeft[row] -= seatsRequired;
                    return true; // All required seats are scattered.
                } else {
                    seatsRequired -= seatsLeft[row];
                    seatsLeft[row] = 0;
                }
            }
        }
        return seatsRequired == 0; // Return true if all seats could be scattered.
    }
}
```

## Strategy
1. **Initialization**: We initialize the available seats per row using an array. Each row is initially set to have `m` seats.
2. **Gather Method**: We iterate through the rows up to `maxRow`. For each row, we check if it has at least `k` consecutive seats available. If found, we return the row and the starting seat number.
3. **Scatter Method**: We iterate through the rows up to `maxRow`. For each row, if seats are available, we reserve as many seats as possible until `k` seats are scattered or all rows are checked.

## Time Complexity
1. **Initialization**: `O(n)` due to filling the array with `m`.
2. **Gather Method**: `O(n)` in the worst case, where `maxRow` can be up to `n-1`.
3. **Scatter Method**: `O(n)` in the worst case, where `maxRow` can be up to `n-1`.

The operations are efficient given the linear relation to the number of rows, which is manageable for reasonable `n` values.
