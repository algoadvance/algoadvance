[Leetcode 299. Bulls and Cows full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l299)
## Problem Statement
You are playing the "Bulls and Cows" game with your friend.

You write a secret `number` and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following info:
- The number of "bulls", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
- The number of "cows", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position.

The function to be implemented is:
```java
public String getHint(String secret, String guess)
```

The input strings `secret` and `guess` are of equal length and contain only digits.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: secret = "1807", guess = "7810"
Output: "1A3B"
Explanation: 
[1 bull (8) and 3 cows]

Input: secret = "1123", guess = "0111"
Output: "1A1B"
Explanation: 
[1 bull (1) and 1 cow (1)]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input strings contain leading zeros?
   - Yes, both `secret` and `guess` can contain leading zeros as they are simply strings of digits.
2. Are there any constraints on the length of `secret` and `guess`?
   - The length of `secret` and `guess` will be the same and it's guaranteed by the problem statement.
3. Is there a maximum length for `secret` and `guess`?
   - Typically, for coding challenges, you should assume the lengths could be reasonably large but within processing limits, up to thousands of characters.

## Strategy
1. **Count Bulls**: First, iterate through the characters of `secret` and `guess` in parallel and count the number of bulls (i.e., correct digits in the correct position).
2. **Count Cows**: Use two frequency arrays to store the counts of unmatched characters from `secret` and `guess`. Then, iterate over these frequency arrays to determine the number of cows.
3. **Construct the Hint**: Combine the counts of bulls and cows into the required "xAyB" format.

### Steps:
- Initialize two arrays to keep the frequency of unmatched characters for both `secret` and `guess`.
- Traverse `secret` and `guess` to find bulls and fill frequency arrays for the remaining characters.
- Traverse the frequency arrays to count cows.
- Return the formatted result.

## Code
Here's the implementation in Java:

```java
public class BullsAndCows {
    public String getHint(String secret, String guess) {
        int bulls = 0;
        int[] secretCount = new int[10];
        int[] guessCount = new int[10];

        for (int i = 0; i < secret.length(); i++) {
            char sChar = secret.charAt(i);
            char gChar = guess.charAt(i);
            if (sChar == gChar) {
                bulls++;
            } else {
                // Increase frequency counts for non-matching characters
                secretCount[sChar - '0']++;
                guessCount[gChar - '0']++;
            }
        }

        int cows = 0;
        // Calculate cows based on the minimum frequency of characters in unmatched characters.
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
            cows += Math.min(secretCount[i], guessCount[i]);
        }

        return bulls + "A" + cows + "B";
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BullsAndCows solution = new BullsAndCows();
        System.out.println(solution.getHint("1807", "7810")); // Output: "1A3B"
        System.out.println(solution.getHint("1123", "0111")); // Output: "1A1B"
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the `secret` (or `guess` since they are of equal length). We traverse the strings a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since the space used for the arrays to count digits is fixed (size 10, since there are only 10 possible digits).
