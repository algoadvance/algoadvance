[Leetcode 3123. Find Edges in Shortest Paths](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3123)
### Problem Statement

You are given a weighted, directed graph represented as an adjacency list. You need to find all edges that are part of any shortest path from a given source node to any other node in the graph.

**Function Signature:**
```java
public List<int[]> findShortestPathEdges(int n, int[][] edges, int source);
```

**Parameters:**
- `int n`: The number of nodes in the graph.
- `int[][] edges`: The edges of the graph where each edge is represented by a triplet `(u, v, w)` that indicates there is a directed edge from node `u` to node `v` with a weight of `w`.
- `int source`: The source node from which the shortest paths are to be determined.

**Returns:**
- `List<int[]>`: A list of edges, each represented by a triplet `(u, v, w)`, that are part of any shortest path from the source node to any other node.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the graph contain cycles?**
   - Yes, the graph can contain cycles as it is a general directed graph.
   
2. **Are there any negative weights in the graph?**
   - No, the problem statement does not mention any negative weights, so we can assume all weights are non-negative.

3. **Is the graph guaranteed to be connected?**
   - No, the graph is not guaranteed to be connected. There might be nodes that are not reachable from the source.

4. **Which algorithm should be used to find the shortest paths?**
   - Given that the weights are non-negative, Dijkstra's algorithm is suitable for finding the shortest paths.

### Strategy

1. **Dijkstra's Algorithm:**
   - Use Dijkstra’s algorithm to find the shortest path distances from the source node to all other nodes.

2. **Track the Predecessors:**
   - While computing the shortest paths, maintain a path array to keep track of predecessors of each node to determine the edges that form part of any shortest path.

3. **Extract Edges from Path Information:**
   - Once we have the shortest path tree, extract the edges that form these shortest paths using the predecessor information.

### Code

Here’s the complete code to solve the problem:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class ShortestPathEdges {

    public List<int[]> findShortestPathEdges(int n, int[][] edges, int source) {
        // Step 1: Create an adjacency list representation of the graph
        Map<Integer, List<int[]>> graph = new HashMap<>();
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            graph.computeIfAbsent(edge[0], k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(new int[]{edge[1], edge[2]});
        }

        // Step 2: Initialize the distance array and the priority queue for Dijkstra's algorithm
        int[] dist = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(dist, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        dist[source] = 0;

        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[1]));
        pq.add(new int[]{source, 0});

        int[] prev = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(prev, -1);

        // Step 3: Perform Dijkstra's algorithm
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            int[] current = pq.poll();
            int u = current[0];
            int d = current[1];

            if (d > dist[u])
                continue;

            for (int[] edge : graph.getOrDefault(u, Collections.emptyList())) {
                int v = edge[0];
                int weight = edge[1];
                int newDist = d + weight;

                if (newDist < dist[v]) {
                    dist[v] = newDist;
                    prev[v] = u;
                    pq.add(new int[]{v, newDist});
                }
            }
        }

        // Step 4: Collect the edges that are part of the shortest paths
        List<int[]> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i != source && prev[i] != -1) {
                result.add(new int[]{prev[i], i, dist[i] - dist[prev[i]]});
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ShortestPathEdges solver = new ShortestPathEdges();
        
        // Example usage
        int n = 5;
        int[][] edges = {
            {0, 1, 2},
            {0, 2, 4},
            {1, 2, 1},
            {1, 3, 7},
            {2, 4, 3},
            {3, 4, 1}
        };
        int source = 0;

        List<int[]> edgesInShortestPaths = solver.findShortestPathEdges(n, edges, source);
        for (int[] edge : edgesInShortestPaths) {
            System.out.println(Arrays.toString(edge));
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Graph Construction:** O(E), where E is the number of edges.
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm:** O((V + E) log V), using an adjacency list and a priority queue.
- **Total Time Complexity:** O((V + E) log V), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
