[Leetcode 2300. Successful Pairs of Spells and Potions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2300)
## Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays, `spells` and `potions`, of length `n` and `m` respectively, and an integer `success`. A spell and potion pair is considered **successful** if the product of their values is at least `success`.

For each spell, find out how many potions form a successful pair with it, and return an array of length `n` where the `i-th` element is the number of successful pairs with the `i-th` spell.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints**:
   - What are the constraints on the lengths of the arrays `spells` and `potions`?
   - What are the constraints on the values within `spells` and `potions`?

2. **Output**:
   - Should the output list be returned in any specific order?
   - What should be the behavior if there are no successful pairs for a particular spell?

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Should we handle the scenario where either of the arrays `spells` or `potions` is empty?

## Strategy

First, let's capture the input constraints from the problem:

- Both `spells` and `potions` have lengths between `1` and `10^5`.
- Each value in the arrays `spells` and `potions` is between `1` and `10^5`.
- The `success` value is between `1` and `10^10`.

Given these constraints, a brute-force solution would involve checking every possible pair, which is O(n * m). This would be too slow for the upper limits of the input size.

### Optimal Strategy

1. **Sort the Potions Array**: Sorting the potions array will help in quickly finding the first potion that, when multiplied with the current spell, meets or exceeds the required `success` threshold.
   
2. **Binary Search for Each Spell**: For each spell, perform a binary search on the sorted potions array to find the smallest potion that forms a successful pair with the spell. This allows us to determine the number of successful pairs efficiently.

Steps in detail:
1. Sort the `potions` array.
2. Iterate over each spell in the `spells` array.
3. For each spell, use binary search to find the smallest index in the `potions` array where `spell * potions[index] >= success`.
4. All subsequent elements in the `potions` array will form successful pairs with the current spell. The count of these elements gives the number of successful pairs for that spell.

## Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int[] successfulPairs(int[] spells, int[] potions, long success) {
        int n = spells.length;
        int[] result = new int[n];
        
        // Sort potions array
        Arrays.sort(potions);
        
        // Iterate over each spell
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int spell = spells[i];
            int count = countSuccessfulPairs(spell, potions, success);
            result[i] = count;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    private int countSuccessfulPairs(int spell, int[] potions, long success) {
        int left = 0, right = potions.length - 1;
        int n = potions.length;
        
        // Binary search to find the smallest index
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if ((long) spell * potions[mid] >= success) {
                right = mid - 1;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        
        // All elements from left to the end of the array
        return n - left;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solver = new Solution();
        int[] spells = {10, 20, 30};
        int[] potions = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        long success = 40;
        int[] result = solver.successfulPairs(spells, potions, success);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(result)); // Expected output: [2, 4, 5]
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- Sorting the `potions` array: O(m log m)
- For each spell, performing binary search: O(n log m)

Thus, the overall complexity is:
- Time: O(m log m + n log m), where `n` is the length of `spells` and `m` is the length of `potions`.
- Space: O(1) extra space (excluding the space needed for input/output storage).
