[Leetcode 923. 3Sum With Multiplicity](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l923)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `arr`, and an integer `target`, return the number of tuples `(i, j, k)` such that `i < j < k` and `arr[i] + arr[j] + arr[k] == target`.

Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Example 1:**
```plaintext
Input: arr = [1,1,2,2,3,3,4,4,5,5], target = 8
Output: 20
```

**Example 2:**
```plaintext
Input: arr = [1,1,2,2,2,2], target = 5
Output: 12
```

**Constraints:**
- `3 <= arr.length <= 3000`
- `0 <= arr[i] <= 100`
- `0 <= target <= 300`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are all elements in `arr` non-negative?
   **A:** Yes, all elements in the array are non-negative integers as per given constraints.

2. **Q:** Can the elements in `arr` be repeated?
   **A:** Yes, elements in the array can be repeated.

3. **Q:** What should we return if no such tuples exist?
   **A:** Return `0` if no such tuples exist.

4. **Q:** Is the result expected modulo `10^9 + 7`?
   **A:** Yes, the result should be returned modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Strategy

1. **Sort the Array**: Since we need `i < j < k`, sorting the array will help us systematically check valid conditions.
2. **Iterate through Array**: Use a combination of nested loops or a sliding window technique to calculate all valid tuples.
3. **Use a HashMap to Track Frequencies**: To efficiently find the counts of numbers that sum to the target, use a frequency map.
4. **Modulo Operation**: Ensure that we apply modulo `10^9 + 7` as we calculate to avoid overflow.

## Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    public int threeSumMulti(int[] arr, int target) {
        int MOD = 1000000007;
        long result = 0;
        Map<Integer, Long> count = new HashMap<>();

        for (int num : arr) {
            count.put(num, count.getOrDefault(num, 0L) + 1);
        }

        for (int i : count.keySet()) {
            for (int j : count.keySet()) {
                int k = target - i - j;
                if (count.containsKey(k)) {
                    long c1 = count.get(i), c2 = count.get(j), c3 = count.get(k);

                    if (i == j && j == k) {
                        result += c1 * (c1 - 1) * (c1 - 2) / 6;
                    } else if (i == j && j != k) {
                        result += c1 * (c1 - 1) / 2 * c3;
                    } else if (i < j && j < k) {
                        result += c1 * c2 * c3;
                    }

                    result %= MOD;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return (int) result;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: In this solution, we didn't sort. Instead, we used a HashMap to count frequencies.
- **Brute Force (Nested Loops)**:
  - The outer two nested loops run for each unique element which can be considered `N` times.
  - Checking each combination for another `N` times results in an O(N^2) approach with efficient counting.

- **Overall Complexity**:
  - Creating the frequency map: O(N) where N is the length of the array.
  - Nested loops to count valid triplets: O(N^2) where N is the number of unique elements in the array.
 
**Hence, the solution has a time complexity of O(N^2)**.
