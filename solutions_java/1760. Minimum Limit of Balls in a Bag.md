[Leetcode 1760. Minimum Limit of Balls in a Bag](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1760)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array `nums` where `nums[i]` is the number of balls in the `i-th` bag. You are also given an integer `maxOperations`. You can perform the following operation at most `maxOperations` times:

- Choose any bag of balls and split it into two new bags with a positive number of balls.

Your task is to minimize the maximum number of balls in a bag. 

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of `nums` and its length**: What can be the minimum and maximum possible length of the array `nums` and the number of balls in each bag?
   - `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
   - `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

2. **Range of `maxOperations`**: What is the range for `maxOperations`?
   - `1 <= maxOperations <= 10^9`

3. **Efficient Solution**: Given the constraints, the solution should be efficient. 

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use binary search to minimize the maximum number of balls in a bag. Here are the steps for the strategy:

1. **Binary Search Setup**: We will use binary search on the possible values of the maximum number of balls in any bag after the possible splits.
2. **Binary Search Range**:
   - Lower bound: `1`
   - Upper bound: The maximum value in `nums`.
3. **Check Feasibility**: For each mid value in our binary search, we will check if it is possible to make all the bags have at most `mid` balls by performing at most `maxOperations` splits.
4. **Feasibility Check**: For each bag, calculate the minimum required splits to make sure all parts have at most `mid` balls. If the total required splits are less than or equal to `maxOperations`, then `mid` is feasible.

### Code
Here is the Java implementation following the above strategy:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimumSize(int[] nums, int maxOperations) {
        // Binary search to find the minimum possible maximum bag size
        int left = 1, right = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            right = Math.max(right, num);
        }
        
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = (left + right) / 2;
            // Check if we can split the bags such that no bag has more than 'mid' balls
            if (canSplit(nums, mid, maxOperations)) {
                right = mid; // Try for a smaller maximum limit
            } else {
                left = mid + 1; // Increase the allowed maximum limit
            }
        }
        
        return left;
    }
    
    private boolean canSplit(int[] nums, int maxBalls, int maxOperations) {
        int operations = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            // Calculate the operations needed to make all parts of the bag <= maxBalls
            if (num > maxBalls) {
                operations += (num - 1) / maxBalls; // Equivalent to num / maxBalls - 1
            }
            if (operations > maxOperations) {
                return false; // More operations than allowed, so mid is not feasible
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search**: O(log(max(nums)))
- **Feasibility Check**: O(n) for each check, where `n` is the length of `nums`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n * log(max(nums))). Given the constraints, this solution will be efficient and should run within acceptable limits.

### Summary
1. We use binary search to find the minimum possible maximum number of balls in any bag.
2. The feasibility of a mid value is checked by comparing the total required operations against `maxOperations`.
3. The approach ensures we efficiently narrow down the optimal maximum bag size.
