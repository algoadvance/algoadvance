[Leetcode 2412. Minimum Money Required Before Transactions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2412)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `transactions` where `transactions[i]` represents the amount of money needed to complete the \(i^{th}\) transaction.

To perform a transaction, you need to have at least as much money available as the transaction amount. After performing a transaction, the amount of money you have decreases by the transaction amount.

Your goal is to find out the minimum amount of money you need to have initially such that you can complete all transactions in the given order.

Write a function:
```java
public int minimumMoney(int[] transactions)
```
that computes the minimum initial amount of money required to complete all transactions.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Q: Are transactions always positive numbers?
   A: For this problem, yes, transactions represent the amount of money required for each transaction, which will be positive integers.

2. Q: Can the array `transactions` contain zero?
   A: No, the problem states that transactions require money, hence all elements will be positive.

3. Q: What are the constraints on the length of `transactions` array?
   A: The constraints are typical for such problems but it is safe to assume that the transactions array can have up to \(10^5\) elements.

### Strategy
1. To handle the requirement efficiently, consider that the initial amount must satisfy the highest demand at any point while processing the transactions.

2. We can use a greedy approach where we aim to find the maximum running balance requirement. Here, the running balance is tracked as if we started with zero and made all transactions. The maximum deficit (-lowest point of the balance) during this running balance translates to the minimum money required initially.

3. We will iterate through the `transactions` list and maintain a `currentBalance`. If at any point `currentBalance` goes negative, we adjust the minimum balance requirement accordingly.

### Code
Here is a possible implementation of the strategy in Java:

```java
public int minimumMoney(int[] transactions) {
    int currentBalance = 0;
    int minDeficit = 0;

    for (int transaction : transactions) {
        currentBalance -= transaction;
        if (currentBalance < minDeficit) {
            minDeficit = currentBalance;
        }
    }

    // We negate minDeficit because it is negative, and to get the positive equivalent of the deficit
    return -minDeficit;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `transactions` array. We only iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), as we are using a fixed amount of additional space irrespective of the input size.

This approach ensures that we find the minimum initial amount of money required efficiently and correctly.
