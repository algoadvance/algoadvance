[Leetcode 1662. Check If Two String Arrays are Equivalent](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1662)
### Problem Statement
The problem "1662. Check If Two String Arrays are Equivalent" requires us to determine if two string arrays are equivalent. Two string arrays are considered equivalent if their concatenation results in the same string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
    - Are string arrays `word1` and `word2` non-empty?
    - What are the maximum lengths of the string arrays and the strings within them?
    - Can the strings contain special characters or digits, or are they limited to alphabets?

2. **Output**:
    - Should the function return a boolean indicating if the concatenation of both arrays results in equivalent strings?

Let's assume:
- `word1` and `word2` contain only lowercase English letters.
- The total length of all the strings combined in both arrays does not exceed \(10^4\) characters.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean arrayStringsAreEqual(String[] word1, String[] word2) {
        StringBuilder sb1 = new StringBuilder();
        StringBuilder sb2 = new StringBuilder();
        
        for (String word : word1) {
            sb1.append(word);
        }
        
        for (String word : word2) {
            sb2.append(word);
        }
        
        return sb1.toString().equals(sb2.toString());
    }
}
```

### Strategy
1. **StringBuilder Usage**: 
    - We will use `StringBuilder` to concatenate all the strings in each array since `StringBuilder` is more efficient for string concatenations compared to using the `+` operator repeatedly. Using a `StringBuilder` helps in minimizing the number of objects created and thus reduces memory overhead.
    
2. **Concatenate Each Array**:
    - Iterate over each string in `word1`, concatenating it into a `StringBuilder`.
    - Repeat this for `word2`.

3. **Compare the Concatenated Results**:
    - Convert both `StringBuilder` objects to strings and compare them using the `equals` method.

### Time Complexity
- **Concatenation**:
    - Let \( n \) be the total number of characters in `word1`.
    - Let \( m \) be the total number of characters in `word2`.
    - The time complexity for concatenating strings in each array using `StringBuilder` is \( O(n) + O(m) \).
    
- **Comparison**:
    - String comparison will take \( O(\min(n, m)) \) time.

Thus, the overall time complexity is:
\[ O(n + m) \]

This solution is efficient and straightforward, operating within linear time relative to the input size.
