[Leetcode 1871. Jump Game VII](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1871)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed binary string `s` and two integers `minJump` and `maxJump`. In the binary string `s`, a '0' represents an empty space and a '1' represents an obstacle. You can start at index `0`, and you want to reach the last index of the string. From index `i`, you can jump to any index `j` such that `i + minJump <= j <= i + maxJump` and `s[j] == '0'`. Return `true` if you can reach the last index of the string, or `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the string `s` guaranteed to have length at least 1?**
   * Yes, the constraints mention that `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`.

2. **Can we assume that `s[0]` is always '0'?**
   * Yes, you start at index `0` and `s[0]` is always '0'.

3. **What should be returned if the only possible jump is to an index with '1'?**
   * Return `false`. You can only jump to indices containing '0'.

### Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach:**
   * Use a queue to manage the indices we can jump from.
   * Use a `visited` array to avoid processing the same index multiple times.
   * Process each index by attempting to jump to all possible indices within the `minJump` and `maxJump` range.
   * Return `true` if reaching the last index; otherwise, `false`.

2. **Efficient Range Management:**
   * To avoid O(n^2) complexity, maintain the maximum index reached so far using prefix sums or a sliding range window.

### Code

Here is the Java implementation using a BFS approach with efficient range management:

```java
import java.util.Queue;
import java.util.LinkedList;

public class JumpGameVII {
    public boolean canReach(String s, int minJump, int maxJump) {
        int n = s.length();
        if (s.charAt(n - 1) == '1') {
            return false;
        }
        
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(0);
        
        int farthest = 0;
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int curr = queue.poll();
            
            for (int next = Math.max(curr + minJump, farthest + 1); next <= Math.min(curr + maxJump, n - 1); next++) {
                if (s.charAt(next) == '0') {
                    if (next == n - 1) {
                        return true;
                    }
                    queue.offer(next);
                }
            }
            farthest = Math.min(curr + maxJump, n - 1);
        }
        
        return false;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JumpGameVII jumpGameVII = new JumpGameVII();
        String s = "011010";
        int minJump = 2;
        int maxJump = 3;
        
        System.out.println(jumpGameVII.canReach(s, minJump, maxJump));  // Output: true
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  * Each index is processed at most once, and each entry and exit from the queue involves a known range based on `minJump` and `maxJump`.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  * We use a queue to store possible indices to jump to and a `visited` array of size `n`.

This approach ensures that we efficiently check reachability using BFS while maintaining the range of possible jumps.
