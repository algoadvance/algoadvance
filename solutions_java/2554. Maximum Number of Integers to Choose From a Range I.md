[Leetcode 2554. Maximum Number of Integers to Choose From a Range I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2554)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n` and a list of banned integers. Your task is to choose the maximum number of integers from the range [1, n] such that no chosen integer is in the list of banned integers.

**Constraints:**
- 1 <= n <= 10^9
- 0 <= banned.length <= 10^5
- 1 <= banned[i] <= n

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the list `banned` guaranteed to have unique integers?**
   - Yes, the problem assumes all integers in `banned` are unique and within the range [1, n].

2. **Can `n` be really large, e.g., up to 10^9?**
   - Yes, n can be as large as one billion, which means the solution needs to be efficient in terms of both time and space.

3. **What to do if `banned` is empty?**
   - If `banned` is empty, the answer is simply the count of all integers from 1 to `n`, i.e., `n`.

## Strategy

1. **Use a Hash Set for Banned Integers:**
   - Store `banned` integers in a HashSet for O(1) average-time complexity checks.

2. **Iterate and Count Non-Banned Integers:**
   - Iterate from 1 to n and count the integers that are not in the `banned` set. This avoids checking each integer against the potentially large `banned` list.

3. **Early Termination:**
   - Given the potentially large size of `n`, we can introduce an early termination if `banned` is empty since the result will be `n`.

## Code

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class Solution {
    public int maxNonBannedIntegers(int n, int[] banned) {
        Set<Integer> bannedSet = new HashSet<>();
        
        // Add banned integers to the set
        for (int num : banned) {
            bannedSet.add(num);
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (!bannedSet.contains(i)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n + m), where `n` is the maximum range value and `m` is the length of the banned list. In the worst case, we iterate from 1 to `n` and perform O(1) set operations for each element.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m), where `m` is the length of the banned list as we store all banned integers in a hash set.

This solution is optimized for cases where `n` is not excessively large and the size of the input (banned list) remains manageable relative to the typical constraints in a competitive programming setting. For very large values of `n` (near 10^9), additional optimizations or algorithms might be required to handle edge cases within resource limits.
