[Leetcode 2865. Beautiful Towers I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2865)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of `heights` of towers such that, for each tower, you can remove a certain number of blocks from its top to make it beautiful. A tower is considered beautiful if its height is either equal to the height of all the other towers or one less than the height of all the other towers.

Your goal is to determine the minimum number of blocks to remove to make all towers beautiful.

Function Signature:
```java
public int minimumBlocksToRemove(int[] heights);
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the heights array be empty?**
   - No, assume the heights array will have at least one tower.
   
2. **Can the elements in the heights array be negative?**
   - No, the heights array will contain only non-negative integers.

3. **What is the maximum length of the heights array?**
   - The length of the heights array can be up to \(10^5\).

4. **What is the range of values for the heights?**
   - Heights can be any integer between 0 and \(10^6\).

### Strategy

1. **Identify the two target heights.**
   - We need to determine the two most common target heights: the most frequent height `h1` and the height that is one less than `h1` if itâ€™s also frequent (`h2`).

2. **Calculate the minimum blocks to remove for each candidate height.**
   - Count the total blocks necessary to make all towers either the height of `h1` or `h2`.

3. **Choose the minimum of these values.**
   - The final result is the minimum blocks to remove among those two calculated values.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    public int minimumBlocksToRemove(int[] heights) {
        // Step 1: Count the frequency of each height.
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> heightFrequency = new HashMap<>();
        for (int height : heights) {
            heightFrequency.put(height, heightFrequency.getOrDefault(height, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        // Step 2: Identify the most common height `h1` and `h2` (height-1 if present).
        int mostFrequentHeight = -1;
        int maxFrequency = 0;
        
        for (Map.Entry<Integer, Integer> entry : heightFrequency.entrySet()) {
            if (entry.getValue() > maxFrequency) {
                mostFrequentHeight = entry.getKey();
                maxFrequency = entry.getValue();
            }
        }
        
        int targetHeight1 = mostFrequentHeight;
        int targetHeight2 = mostFrequentHeight - 1;
        
        // Step 3: Calculate the total blocks to remove in two scenarios.
        int blocksToRemove1 = 0;
        int blocksToRemove2 = 0;
        
        for (int height : heights) {
            if (height > targetHeight1) {
                blocksToRemove1 += (height - targetHeight1);
            }
            if (height != targetHeight2) {
                blocksToRemove2 += (height - targetHeight2);
            }
        }
        
        // Edge case: if height - 1 possibility is not present in the original list
        if (!heightFrequency.containsKey(targetHeight2)) {
            blocksToRemove2 = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        }
        
        // Step 4: Return the minimum blocks to remove.
        return Math.min(blocksToRemove1, blocksToRemove2);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of towers. This accounts for counting frequencies and calculating the blocks to remove.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the number of distinct heights in the input, which can be up to \(n\) in the worst case. This space is used for the frequency map.
