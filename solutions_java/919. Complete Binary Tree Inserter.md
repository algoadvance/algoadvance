[Leetcode 919. Complete Binary Tree Inserter](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l919)
### Problem Statement
You need to implement two functions: a constructor `CBTInserter(TreeNode root)` and a method `insert(int v)`. The `CBTInserter` class is used to insert new nodes into a complete binary tree while maintaining its completeness, that is, if `insert` is called with a value, it should insert a TreeNode with that value into its correct position in the complete binary tree.

Additionally, you should implement a method `get_root()` that returns the root node of the tree.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Question:** Does the function signature `CBTInserter(TreeNode root)` assume that `root` is always a complete binary tree?
   - **Answer:** Yes, `root` is always assumed to be the root of a complete binary tree.

2. **Question:** How should the tree be represented in memory?
   - **Answer:** The tree is represented using the `TreeNode` class, where each node has a value (`val`) and pointers to its left (`left`) and right (`right`) children.

3. **Question:** Are there any constraints on the integer values to be inserted?
   - **Answer:** The problem assumes typical integer constraints for values to be inserted into the tree.

### Strategy
1. **Initialization (`CBTInserter(TreeNode root)`)**:
   - Use a `Queue` to keep track of potential parent nodes that either need a left child or a right child. This helps to identify where to insert the next node.
   
2. **Insertion (`insert(int v)`)**:
   - Use the `Queue` to identify the correct parent node for the new value.
   - Insert the new node into the first parent node that has an available child position.
   - Add the new node itself to the queue if it can later become a parent (i.e., it can have children in the future).

3. **Get Root (`get_root()`)**:
   - Simply return the root of the tree that was initialized with the inserter.

### Code
```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

class CBTInserter {
    private TreeNode root;
    private Queue<TreeNode> potentialParents;

    public CBTInserter(TreeNode root) {
        this.root = root;
        this.potentialParents = new LinkedList<>();
        Queue<TreeNode> nodeQueue = new LinkedList<>();
        nodeQueue.add(root);
        
        while (!nodeQueue.isEmpty()) {
            TreeNode node = nodeQueue.poll();
            if (node.left == null || node.right == null) {
                potentialParents.add(node);
            }
            if (node.left != null) {
                nodeQueue.add(node.left);
            }
            if (node.right != null) {
                nodeQueue.add(node.right);
            }
        }
    }
    
    public int insert(int v) {
        TreeNode newNode = new TreeNode(v);
        TreeNode parent = potentialParents.peek();
        if (parent.left == null) {
            parent.left = newNode;
        } else {
            parent.right = newNode;
            potentialParents.poll(); // parent now has two children
        }
        potentialParents.add(newNode);
        return parent.val;
    }
    
    public TreeNode get_root() {
        return root;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Initialization (`CBTInserter(TreeNode root)`)**:
   - **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we traverse all nodes to build our queue of potential parents.
   
2. **Insertion (`insert(int v)`)**:
   - **Time Complexity:** O(1), since we are using a queue to directly access the next parent node and perform the insertion.

3. **Get Root (`get_root()`)**:
   - **Time Complexity:** O(1), since it simply returns the root node.

With these strategies and efficient use of queues, the insertion process in a complete binary tree is managed with optimal time complexity.
