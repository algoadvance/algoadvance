[Leetcode 2579. Count Total Number of Colored Cells](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2579)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `n x n` grid, initially filled with white cells. You can color some cells in the grid with any color. Your task is to write an algorithm to find the total number of colored cells after `n` operations. Each operation consists of choosing a single uncolored cell and coloring it some color.

The goal is to determine the total number of colored cells after performing all of the operations as described.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of `n`?
   - Can any cell be recolored in the operations?

2. **Operations:**
   - Do the operations guarantee that all chosen cells are distinct?
   - Are there any specific conditions for which cells can be colored?

3. **Grid Attributes:**
   - Do operations always color one cell, or can it be more than one cell at a time?
   
Assuming standard clarifications:
- `n` is an integer value with a reasonable constraint that fits within typical competitive programming limits.
- Each operation involves coloring exactly one previously uncolored cell.
- No cell is recolored (operation targets previously uncolored cells).

## Strategy

Given the conditions that each operation colors a single uncolored cell and there are `n` such operations, the total number of colored cells will simply be `n`. This is because each operation colors one new cell and no cells are recolored.

## Code

Here's how you can solve the problem:

```java
public class ColoredCellsCounter {
    public static int countColoredCells(int n) {
        // Simply return n because each operation colors exactly one previously uncolored cell.
        return n;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example Test Cases
        System.out.println(countColoredCells(3)); // Output: 3
        System.out.println(countColoredCells(5)); // Output: 5
        System.out.println(countColoredCells(10)); // Output: 10
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is `O(1)` because the result is computed in constant time regardless of the value of `n`. The algorithm relies on simple arithmetic without the need for iteration or recursion.
