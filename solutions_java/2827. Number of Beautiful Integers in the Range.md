[Leetcode 2827. Number of Beautiful Integers in the Range](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2827)
### Problem Statement
Given a range `[low, high]`, you need to count how many integers within that range are considered "beautiful." An integer is defined as beautiful if:
- The sum of its digits is even.
- For a number to be beautiful, its reversed version should also have even sum of its digits.
  
Write a function that counts all such "beautiful" integers in the range `[low, high]`.

### Clarifying Questions
Before we start, let's clarify a few points to ensure we understand the problem correctly:
1. **Range Inclusive**: Should `high` be included in the range?
2. **Zero and Negative Numbers**: Are zero or negative numbers considered, and can they be part of the range?
3. **Output**: Should the output be just the count of beautiful numbers or do we need to list them as well?

Assuming:
1. Yes, `high` should be included.
2. Let's focus on positive integers greater than zero for simplicity.
3. The output should be just the count.

### Code
Let's implement a function to solve this problem.

```java
public class BeautifulIntegerCounter {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println(countBeautifulNumbersInRange(10, 100)); // Example usage
    }
    
    public static int countBeautifulNumbersInRange(int low, int high) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int num = low; num <= high; num++) {
            if (isBeautiful(num) && isBeautiful(reverseNumber(num))) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
    
    private static boolean isBeautiful(int num) {
        return digitSum(num) % 2 == 0;
    }
    
    private static int digitSum(int num) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            sum += num % 10;
            num /= 10;
        }
        return sum;
    }
    
    private static int reverseNumber(int num) {
        int reversed = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            reversed = reversed * 10 + num % 10;
            num /= 10;
        }
        return reversed;
    }
}
```

### Strategy
1. **Iterate through the range**: Loop from `low` to `high` (inclusive).
2. **Check if a number is beautiful**: Create a helper method `isBeautiful` that checks if the sum of the digits is even.
3. **Reverse and check**: Create another helper method to reverse the number and check if the reversed number is also beautiful.
4. **Count beautiful numbers**: Keep a counter to count numbers that satisfy both conditions.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution depends on two factors:
1. **Range Iteration**: O(N) where N is the difference between `high` and `low`.
2. **Digit Processing**: For each number, digit summation and reversal will take O(D) where D is the number of digits (in worst case, log10(N)).

So overall, the time complexity is approximately O(N * log(N)), which is efficient for moderately large ranges.
