[Leetcode 1562. Find Latest Group of Size M](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1562)
### Problem Statement

We are given a binary array `arr` and an integer `m`. `arr` is a binary dynamic array of length `n`, where n is the length of the array `arr`. The array `arr` is initially filled with zeros. We are required to change the array `arr` one step a time, by changing one 0 into 1. Once an element is changed to 1, it cannot be changed back to 0. 

We are given the `indices` array where `indices[i]` corresponds to the position in `arr` that is turned into 1 on the i-th operation. The goal is to find the last step at which there exists a group of `1`s of length exactly `m`.

If no such step exists, return -1.

### Example:
```
Input: arr = [0,0,0,0,0], m = 2, indices = [1,2,5,3,4]
Output: 4
Explanation:
After step 4, we get a binary array [1,1,1,1,1] where there is a group of 1's of length 2 [5, 4]

Input: arr = [0,0,0,0,0], m = 3, indices = [3,4,2,1,5]
Output: -1
Explanation:
No group of 1's of length 3 exists.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for `n` and `m`?**
    - The length `n` of the array `arr` and `m` can be any integer within typical computational constraints (1 ≤ m ≤ n ≤ 10^5).

2. **How are the elements of the `indices` array indexed?**
    - The elements of the `indices` array are 1-based (start from 1), so an element `i` in `indices` means that the (i-1)th element in `arr` should be set to 1.

3. **Should we consider boundary conditions where no such group of '1's might exist?**
    - Yes, if at any step there is no such group of size `m`, ensure the program returns `-1`.

### Strategy

1. We will use a union-find data structure to efficiently manage and query connected components of `1`s in the array.
2. For each position index given in `indices`:
    - Switch that position from 0 to 1 in `arr`.
    - Use union-find to merge connected components including the newly added `1`.
    - Track the lengths of these components using a hash table to efficiently query sizes.
    - Keep track of the last step where the length of any connected component equals `m`.

### Code

Here is the Java implementation:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int findLatestStep(int[] arr, int m) {
        int n = arr.length;
        if (m == n) return n; // special case where the whole array is updated

        int[] parent = new int[n + 1];
        int[] size = new int[n + 1];
        Map<Integer, Integer> lengthCount = new HashMap<>();
        
        Arrays.fill(parent, -1);

        for (int step = 0; step < n; step++) {
            int index = arr[step] - 1;
            parent[index] = index;
            size[index] = 1;
            lengthCount.put(1, lengthCount.getOrDefault(1, 0) + 1);

            if (index > 0 && parent[index - 1] != -1) {
                merge(index, index - 1, parent, size, lengthCount);
            }
            if (index < n - 1 && parent[index + 1] != -1) {
                merge(index, index + 1, parent, size, lengthCount);
            }

            if (lengthCount.getOrDefault(m, 0) > 0) {
                return step + 1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }

    private int find(int x, int[] parent) {
        if (parent[x] != x) {
            parent[x] = find(parent[x], parent);
        }
        return parent[x];
    }
  
    private void merge(int x, int y, int[] parent, int[] size, Map<Integer, Integer> lengthCount) {
        int rootX = find(x, parent);
        int rootY = find(y, parent);
        if (rootX != rootY) {
            int sizeX = size[rootX];
            int sizeY = size[rootY];
          
            parent[rootX] = rootY;
            size[rootY] += size[rootX];

            lengthCount.put(sizeX, lengthCount.getOrDefault(sizeX, 0) - 1);
            if (lengthCount.get(sizeX) == 0) lengthCount.remove(sizeX);
            
            lengthCount.put(sizeY, lengthCount.getOrDefault(sizeY, 0) - 1);
            if (lengthCount.get(sizeY) == 0) lengthCount.remove(sizeY);
            
            lengthCount.put(size[rootY], lengthCount.getOrDefault(size[rootY], 0) + 1);
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Union-Find operations** (find and union) generally run in nearly constant time, i.e., O(α(n)) where α is the Inverse Ackermann function and n is the number of elements.
- Thus, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is O(n α(n)), which is efficient for the given constraints within computational limits.
