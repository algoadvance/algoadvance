[Leetcode 1094. Car Pooling](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1094)
### Problem Statement

You are driving a vehicle that has `capacity` empty seats initially available for passengers. The vehicle only drives east (i.e., it cannot turn around and drive west).

Given a list of `trips`, `trip[i] = [numPassengers, fromi, toi]` indicates that the `i-th` trip has `numPassengers` passengers, and the locations `fromi` and `toi` are the start and end points, respectively. The locations are given as the number of kilometers due east from your vehicle's initial location.

Return `true` if it is possible to pick up and drop off all passengers for all the given trips, or `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the number of trips and the values of `numPassengers`, `fromi`, and `toi`?**
   - The number of trips will be in the range `[1, 1000]`.
   - The number of passengers for any trip will be in the range `[1, 100]`.
   - The start and end points of any trip will be in the range `[0, 1000]`.

2. **Can `fromi` and `toi` be the same?**
   - Yes, `fromi` and `toi` can be the same for any trip.

3. **Should the trips be considered sequentially or can passengers be dropped off/picked up any time within their specified intervals?**
   - Passengers can be dropped off and picked up at any point within the given intervals, but the vehicle only moves eastward.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use the following strategy:

1. **Use an array to keep track of the number of passengers at each kilometer mark up to the maximum distance:**
   - Create an array `delta` of size 1001 (since locations range from 0 to 1000) initialized to 0.
   - For each trip, increment the number of passengers at the `fromi` index and decrement them at the `toi` index in the `delta` array.

2. **Calculate the prefix sum of the array `delta` to determine the number of passengers at each location:**
   - Traverse the `delta` array while calculating the running total of passengers.
   - If at any point the number of passengers exceeds the vehicle's capacity, return `false`.

3. **Return `true` if the vehicle can handle all trips without exceeding its capacity.**

### Code

```java
public class CarPooling {
    public boolean carPooling(int[][] trips, int capacity) {
        int[] delta = new int[1001];
        
        // Update the delta array for each trip
        for (int i = 0; i < trips.length; i++) {
            int numPassengers = trips[i][0];
            int from = trips[i][1];
            int to = trips[i][2];
            
            delta[from] += numPassengers;
            delta[to] -= numPassengers;
        }
        
        // Calculate the running total of passengers
        int currentPassengers = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < delta.length; i++) {
            currentPassengers += delta[i];
            if (currentPassengers > capacity) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CarPooling solution = new CarPooling();
        int[][] trips = {{2, 1, 5}, {3, 3, 7}};
        int capacity = 4;
        System.out.println(solution.carPooling(trips, capacity)); // Output: false
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is \(O(N + D)\), where \(N\) is the number of trips and \(D\) is the range of the locations (which is 1001 in this case). 

1. **O(N)**: Iterating over the `trips` array to update the `delta` array.
2. **O(D)**: Calculating the running total from the `delta` array, where \(D\) is a constant (1001).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(N)\).
