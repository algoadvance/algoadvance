[Leetcode 2833. Furthest Point From Origin](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2833)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `moves` that represents the movement instructions of a character starting at the origin `(0,0)` on a 2D plane, return the maximum distance the character can be from the origin after executing the given moves.

The string `moves` consists of characters `'L'` (left), `'R'` (right), or `'_'` (either left or right).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the `_` character be replaced by either `L` or `R` to maximize the distance from the origin?
   - **A:** Yes, `'_ '` can be replaced with either `'L'` or `'R'`.

2. **Q:** Are there any limits on the length of the string `moves`?
   - **A:** While the problem doesn't specify, typical interview constraints might range from 1 to 10,000 or so.

3. **Q:** Can there be any invalid characters in the string?
   - **A:** No, the problem guarantees that the string only contains `'L'`, `'R'`, or `'_'`.

### Strategy

To maximize the distance from the origin, we need to understand the effect of each character:

1. `'L'` moves the character 1 unit left (towards the negative x-axis).
2. `'R'` moves the character 1 unit right (towards the positive x-axis).
3. `'_ '` can move the character either left or right. To maximize the distance, each `'_ '` should move in the direction that currently increases the net displacement further.

The steps are:
1. Compute the net displacement from all `'L'` and `'R'` moves.
2. Add the number of `'_ '` moves to the absolute value of this net displacement to maximize it.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int furthestDistanceFromOrigin(String moves) {
        int leftCount = 0;
        int rightCount = 0;
        int underscoreCount = 0;
        
        for (char move : moves.toCharArray()) {
            if (move == 'L') {
                leftCount++;
            } else if (move == 'R') {
                rightCount++;
            } else {
                underscoreCount++;
            }
        }
        
        int netDisplacement = Math.abs(leftCount - rightCount);
        return netDisplacement + underscoreCount;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization:** We initialize three counters, `leftCount`, `rightCount`, and `underscoreCount`, to 0.
2. **Counting Loops:** We iterate over the `moves` string and increment the counters based on whether the character is `'L'`, `'R'`, or `'_'`.
3. **Net Displacement Calculation:** We calculate the net displacement from the number of left and right moves using `Math.abs(leftCount - rightCount)`.
4. **Maximum Distance:** We add the number of underscores to the net displacement to get the furthest distance possible, as each underscore can be used to further either direction.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string `moves`. We traverse the string once to count each type of move, making the solution efficient and optimal for large inputs.
