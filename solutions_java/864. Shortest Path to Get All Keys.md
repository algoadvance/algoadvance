[Leetcode 864. Shortest Path to Get All Keys](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l864)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D grid `grid` of size `m x n` where:

- `'.'` is an empty cell.
- `'#'` is a wall.
- `'@'` is the starting point.
- Lowercase letters represent keys.
- Uppercase letters represent locks.

You start at the starting point, and you need to reach all the keys. 

The goal is to find the shortest path that collects all the keys and return the number of steps needed. If it's impossible, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the size range of the grid (`m` and `n`)?**
   - Generally mentioned in constraints, now assumed reasonably large but within typical LeetCode problem constraints.

2. **What are the contents of each type of cell?**
   - Covered by problem statement.

3. **Is there at most one starting point and one of each key and lock?**
   - Yes, usually assumed unless otherwise stated.

4. **Is it guaranteed that there is at least one path to collect all keys?**
   - Not necessarily, hence we may return -1 if it is impossible.

### Strategy
We can solve this problem using Breadth-First Search (BFS), as it's suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted grid. The challenge here comes from the fact that there are keys and locks, which makes it necessary to maintain the state of collected keys.

**Steps:**
1. **Initialize BFS Queue & Visited Set:**
    - The queue should store tuples of the current position `(row, col)`, the number of steps taken, and a bitmask representing collected keys.
    - The `visited` set should store tuples `(row, col, keys)` to avoid revisiting the same state.

2. **Grid Traversal:**
    - Start from the initial position `'@'`.
    - Use a bitmask to track collected keys (each key represented by a bit).
    - From each cell, try moving in 4 possible directions.
    - If we collect all keys, return the number of steps.
    - If we encounter a lock, check if the corresponding key is already collected using the bitmask.

3. **End Condition:**
   - Return `-1` if the queue is exhausted without collecting all keys.

### Time Complexity 
The worst-case time complexity is `O(m * n * 2^K)` where `K` is the number of keys, considering the state space would multiply due to the keys' bitmask.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    private static final int[][] DIRECTIONS = // use example above
    
    public int shortestPathAllKeys(String[] grid) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length();
        int allKeys = 0;
        int startX = 0, startY = 0;
        
        // Determine the starting point and number of keys
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                char cell = grid[i].charAt(j);
                if (cell == '@') {
                    startX = i;
                    startY = j;
                } else if (cell >= 'a' && cell <= 'f') {
                    allKeys |= (1 << (cell - 'a'));
                }
            }
        }
        
        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
        
        queue.offer(new int[] {startX, startY, 0, 0});
        visited.add(startX + "_" + startY + "_0");
        
        int steps = 0;
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int size = queue.size();
            
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                int[] current = queue.poll();
                int x = current[0];
                int y = current[1];
                int keys = current[2];
                
                if (keys == allKeys) return steps;
                
                for (int[] direction : DIRECTIONS) {
                    int newX = x + direction[0];
                    int newY = y + direction[1];
                    
                    if (newX < 0 || newY < 0 || newX >= m || newY >= n) continue;
                    
                    char newCell = grid[newX].charAt(newY);
                    
                    if (newCell == '#') continue;

                    if (newCell >= 'A' && newCell <= 'F' && (keys & (1 << (newCell - 'A'))) == 0) {
                        continue;
                    }
                    
                    int newKeys = keys;
                    if (newCell >= 'a' && newCell <= 'f') {
                        newKeys |= (1 << (newCell - 'a'));
                    }
                    
                    String state = newX + "_" + newY + "_" + newKeys;
                    if (!visited.contains(state)) {
                        visited.add(state);
                        queue.offer(new int[]{newX, newY, newKeys});
                    }
                }
            }
            steps++;
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}
```

This code initializes BFS from the starting point, and it carefully tracks visited states including the keys collected to ensure the shortest path is found. If it is impossible to collect all keys, it returns -1.
