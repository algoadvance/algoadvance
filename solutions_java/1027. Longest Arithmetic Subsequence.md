[Leetcode 1027. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1027)
## Problem Statement:
Given an array `A` of integers, return the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence in `A`.

Recall that a subsequence of `A` is a list `A[i1], A[i2], ..., A[ik]` with `0 <= i1 < i2 < ... < ik <= A.length - 1`, and that a sequence `B` is arithmetic if `B[i+1] - B[i]` is the same for all `0 <= i < B.length - 1`.

### Example:
1. Input: A = [3, 6, 9, 12]
   Output: 4
   Explanation: The whole array is an arithmetic sequence with difference 3.

2. Input: A = [9, 4, 7, 2, 10]
   Output: 3
   Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [4, 7, 10].

3. Input: A = [20, 1, 15, 3, 10, 5, 8]
   Output: 4
   Explanation: The longest arithmetic subsequence is [20, 15, 10, 5].

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Is it guaranteed that the input array will have at least 2 elements?
2. What is the range of the values for elements in the array?
3. Is there a preferred time complexity for the solution?

## Strategy:
1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - We'll utilize a hash map to store the length of the arithmetic subsequence ending at each index with a specific difference.
   - For each pair of indices (i, j) where `i < j`, compute the difference `diff = A[j] - A[i]` and update the subsequence length accordingly in the map.

2. **Steps:**
   - Create a map `dp` where `dp[j]` holds another map such that `dp[j][diff]` is the length of the arithmetic subsequence ending at index `j` with difference `diff`.
   - Iterate through each element `A[i]` and for each subsequent element `A[j]`, calculate the `diff` and use `dp[i][diff]` to update `dp[j][diff]`.

3. **Time Complexity:**
   - The solution has a time complexity of `O(n^2)` because for each element, we check all previous elements to compute the difference and update the sequences accordingly. This is efficient for the problem constraints.

## Code:
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class LongestArithmeticSubsequence {
    public int longestArithSeqLength(int[] A) {
        int n = A.length;
        if (n == 0) return 0;

        // Create a map to store the length of arithmetic subsequence for each difference
        Map<Integer, Integer>[] dp = new HashMap[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = new HashMap<>();
        }

        int maxLength = 2;
        for (int j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < j; i++) {
                int diff = A[j] - A[i];

                // length of seq ending at i with difference diff
                int len = dp[i].getOrDefault(diff, 1) + 1;

                // update the length of seq ending at j with difference diff
                dp[j].put(diff, len);

                // update the maximum length found
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, len);
            }
        }

        return maxLength;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LongestArithmeticSubsequence solver = new LongestArithmeticSubsequence();
        int[] example1 = {3, 6, 9, 12};
        System.out.println(solver.longestArithSeqLength(example1)); // Output: 4

        int[] example2 = {9, 4, 7, 2, 10};
        System.out.println(solver.longestArithSeqLength(example2)); // Output: 3

        int[] example3 = {20, 1, 15, 3, 10, 5, 8};
        System.out.println(solver.longestArithSeqLength(example3)); // Output: 4
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n^2)` where `n` is the length of the input array. This is due to the nested loops iterating through the array.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n^2)` in the worst case due to the storage in the hash maps.
