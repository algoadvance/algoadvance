[Leetcode 405. Convert a Number to Hexadecimal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l405)
### Problem Statement
You need to write a function that converts a given integer to its hexadecimal representation. For the purpose of this problem, assume that all integers are signed 32-bit integers, and you are not allowed to use any built-in libraries to directly solve this problem.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Can the input number be negative?
   - **A**: Yes, the input number can be negative as it is a signed 32-bit integer.
2. **Q**: How should negative numbers be handled in the hexadecimal representation?
   - **A**: For negative numbers, you should use twoâ€™s complement notation.

### Strategy
1. **Handle Edge Cases**:
   - If `num` is 0, simply return "0".
   - Since the problem specifies a 32-bit signed integer, special consideration is required for numbers that are negative.
   
2. **Two's Complement for Negative Numbers**:
   - The two's complement of a negative number `x` is calculated by `2^32 + x`.
   
3. **Conversion to Hexadecimal**:
   - Use a loop to continuously extract the last 4 bits from the number and map these to their corresponding hexadecimal character.
   - Use bit manipulation to shift the number and extract bits.

### Code
Here is the implementation of the solution:

```java
public class Solution {
    public String toHex(int num) {
        if (num == 0) {
            return "0";
        }

        char[] hexChars = "0123456789abcdef".toCharArray();
        StringBuilder hexString = new StringBuilder();

        // we are only interested in the last 32 bits of num
        while (num != 0 && hexString.length() < 8) {
            int currentHexDigit = num & 0xf; // Extract the last 4 bits
            hexString.append(hexChars[currentHexDigit]);
            num >>>= 4; // Logical right shift by 4 bits
        }

        return hexString.reverse().toString();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        
        // Test cases
        System.out.println(sol.toHex(26)); // Expected "1a"
        System.out.println(sol.toHex(-1)); // Expected "ffffffff"
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Edge Case Handling**: We check if `num` is 0 and return "0" immediately.
2. **Hex Characters**: We define a character array holding all hexadecimal characters.
3. **Hex Conversion Loop**:
   - We use a loop to repeatedly extract the last 4 bits of the number using `num & 0xf`.
   - Append the corresponding hexadecimal character to a `StringBuilder`.
   - Perform a logical right shift (`>>>`) to remove the last 4 bits.
   - Repeat until the number becomes 0 or we have processed 8 characters (handling the limitation of a 32-bit number).
4. **Reverse and Return**: The `StringBuilder` contents are reversed at the end because we constructed the hex string from least significant to most significant digit.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this conversion is O(1), because the loop iterates at most 8 times (since a 32-bit number can be represented by at most 8 hexadecimal digits). Thus, the computation does not depend on the size or value of the input integer.
