[Leetcode 1358. Number of Substrings Containing All Three Characters full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1358)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s` consisting only of characters `a`, `b`, and `c`. Your task is to find the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters `a`, `b`, and `c`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints?**
   - The length of the string `s` will be between `3` and `5 * 10^4`.
   
2. **Examples?**
   - Input: `s = "abcabc"`
     Output: `10`
     
   - Input: `s = "aaacb"`
     Output: `3`

3. **Should we consider substrings with exact one occurrence of `a`, `b`, `c` or at least one occurrence?**
   - We need to count substrings with at least one occurrence of each character.

### Strategy
1. **Sliding Window Technique:**
   - Use a two-pointer technique to maintain a sliding window on the string.
   - Track the count of `a`, `b`, and `c` characters in the window.
   - If the window contains all three characters at least once, every substring starting from the left end of the window up to the right end forms a valid substring.
   - Count these substrings and then shrink the window from the left to look for the next set of valid substrings.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int numberOfSubstrings(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int count = 0;
        int[] freq = new int[3]; // To store frequency of characters 'a', 'b' and 'c'
        int left = 0; // left pointer of the sliding window
        
        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            freq[s.charAt(right) - 'a']++;
            
            // Make sure our window has atleast one of each character
            while (freq[0] > 0 && freq[1] > 0 && freq[2] > 0) {
                // Every substring from 'left' to the end of the string is valid
                count += n - right;
                
                // Move left pointer of the window to make the substring shorter
                freq[s.charAt(left) - 'a']--;
                left++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.numberOfSubstrings("abcabc")); // Outputs 10
        System.out.println(sol.numberOfSubstrings("aaacb")); // Outputs 3
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sliding Window Approach:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string.
    - Both pointers traverse the string once.
    - Increment and decrement operations are `O(1)` for the sliding window.
    - Thus, the algorithm is linear in time complexity.

### Space Complexity
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` (constant space)
    - Only a fixed-size array (`freq` of size 3) is used to store character counts. No additional space dependent on the input size is used.
