[Leetcode 1911. Maximum Alternating Subsequence Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1911)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums`, you need to find the maximum possible alternating subsequence sum of arrays that can be formed by picking elements from `nums`. An alternating subsequence is a sequence where the elements are alternating between peaks and valleys, i.e., not consecutively increasing or decreasing. For maximum alternating subsequence sum, pick elements such that positive elements appear at even indices and negative elements at odd indices or vice versa.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Can the input array contain both positive and negative integers?**
   - Yes, the input array can contain both positive and negative integers.

2. **Q: Can the array be empty?**
   - As per typical constraints, no. But if it is, the maximum alternating subsequence sum would be `0`.

3. **Q: What are the constraints on the size of the array?**
   - We will assume that the size of the array is within 10^5 elements, which is typical for such problems.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use Dynamic Programming. We define two states: 

- `even` for tracking the maximum sum that ends on an even index.
- `odd` for tracking the maximum sum that ends on an odd index.

The idea is to iterate through the array and update these states by considering two choices at every position:

1. Include the current element in the "even-indexed" sequence.
2. Include the current element in the "odd-indexed" sequence.

This leads to the following state transitions:
- `new_even` = `max(even, odd + nums[i])`
- `new_odd` = `max(odd, even - nums[i])`

Here `new_even` and `new_odd` represent the potential new values of even and odd, if we included `nums[i]` in the respective sequences.

### Code

```java
public class MaximumAlternatingSubsequenceSum {
    public long maxAlternatingSum(int[] nums) {
        long even = 0, odd = Long.MIN_VALUE;

        for (int num : nums) {
            long newEven = Math.max(even, odd + num);
            long newOdd = Math.max(odd, even - num);
            even = newEven;
            odd = newOdd;
        }

        return even;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximumAlternatingSubsequenceSum mass = new MaximumAlternatingSubsequenceSum();
        int[] nums = {4, 2, 5, 3};
        System.out.println(mass.maxAlternatingSum(nums)); // Output: 7
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array. This is because we are iterating through the array once and updating our state variables in constant time.

The space complexity is `O(1)` since we are using only a fixed number of variables to keep track of our states (`even` and `odd`).
