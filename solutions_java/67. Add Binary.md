[Leetcode 67. Add Binary](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l67)
### Problem Statement

Given two binary strings `a` and `b`, return their sum as a binary string.

You may assume that the input strings are non-empty and only contain characters `1` and `0`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Are the input strings guaranteed to only have '0's and '1's?
   - **A**: Yes, the input strings are guaranteed to contain only binary digits.

2. **Q**: Is there a maximum length for the input strings?
   - **A**: The problem does not specify a maximum length, so we'll assume they can be reasonably large.

3. **Q**: Should the output string be the minimal representation of the binary number?
   - **A**: Yes, the output should not have any leading zeros, except for the binary number `0`.

### Strategy

1. Initialize an empty `StringBuilder` to store the result.
2. Initialize carry to 0 to handle any carry-over in the addition process.
3. Traverse both strings from right to left, adding corresponding bits and the carry.
4. Append the result of each addition to the `StringBuilder`.
5. After completing the traversal, if there is a remaining carry, append it to the `StringBuilder`.
6. Since the bits are added from right to left, reverse the `StringBuilder` to get the final binary sum string.

### Code

Here's the Java implementation of the above strategy:

```java
public class AddBinary {
    public String addBinary(String a, String b) {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        int carry = 0;
        int i = a.length() - 1; // Pointer for string a
        int j = b.length() - 1; // Pointer for string b
        
        while (i >= 0 || j >= 0) {
            int sum = carry;
            if (i >= 0) {
                sum += a.charAt(i) - '0'; // Convert character to integer
                i--;
            }
            if (j >= 0) {
                sum += b.charAt(j) - '0'; // Convert character to integer
                j--;
            }
            result.append(sum % 2); // Append the binary digit
            carry = sum / 2; // Calculate the new carry
        }
        
        if (carry != 0) {
            result.append(carry); // If there is any carry left, append it
        }
        
        return result.reverse().toString(); // Reverse the result to get the correct binary sum
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(max(N, M)), where `N` and `M` are the lengths of the input strings `a` and `b`, respectively. This is because we traverse both strings once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(max(N, M)), which is the space required to store the resulting binary string.

This solution efficiently handles the addition of two binary strings and ensures correctness with the appropriate handling of carry-over.
