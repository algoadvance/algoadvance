[Leetcode 1049. Last Stone Weight II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1049)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `stones` where `stones[i]` is the weight of the i-th stone. We are playing a game with the stones. On each turn, we choose any two stones and smash them together. Suppose the stones have weights `x` and `y` with `x <= y`. The result of this smash is:
* If `x == y`, both stones are destroyed, and
* If `x != y`, the stone of weight `x` is destroyed, and the stone of weight `y` has new weight `y - x`.

At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left. Return the smallest possible weight of the left stone. If there are no stones left, return 0.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can the stones array be empty?
   **A**: According to the problem, the stones array will have at least one stone, so it will not be empty.

2. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the size or values of the stones?
   **A**: The constraints arenâ€™t given in the problem statement, but we should assume typical constraint values like in LeetCode problems: `1 <= stones.length <= 30` and `1 <= stones[i] <= 100`.

### Strategy

The problem can be solved using dynamic programming, similar to the "Partition Equal Subset Sum". The goal is to partition the stones into two subsets with the smallest possible difference in their sums. 

To achieve this:
1. Calculate the total sum of all stones.
2. Use a dynamic programming approach to determine the closest possible sum to half the total sum that can be achieved using a subset of the stones.
3. The answer will be the difference between the total sum and twice this subset sum.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class LastStoneWeightII {
    public int lastStoneWeightII(int[] stones) {
        int sum = Arrays.stream(stones).sum();
        int target = sum / 2;
        boolean[] dp = new boolean[target + 1];
        dp[0] = true;

        for (int stone : stones) {
            for (int j = target; j >= stone; --j) {
                dp[j] |= dp[j - stone];
            }
        }

        for (int i = target; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (dp[i]) {
                return sum - 2 * i;
            }
        }

        return 0;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LastStoneWeightII solution = new LastStoneWeightII();
        int[] stones = {2,7,4,1,8,1};
        System.out.println(solution.lastStoneWeightII(stones)); // Output: 1
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(S * n), where S is the total weight of stones divided by 2 (sum/2), and n is the number of stones.
- **Space Complexity**: O(S), where S is the total weight of stones divided by 2. Only a boolean array of size S/2 + 1 is used.

This solution efficiently utilizes dynamic programming to find the smallest possible remaining stone weight.
