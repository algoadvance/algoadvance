[Leetcode 1073. Adding Two Negabinary Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1073)
### Problem Statement
Given two negabinary numbers `arr1` and `arr2` (each number can consist of digits ranging from 0 to 1), return their sum in the same negabinary format as an array of 0s and 1s.

A negabinary number is a representation of a binary number in base `-2`. The sum should be returned with no leading zeros unless the result is 0 itself.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format:**
   - `arr1` : int[] where each element is either 0 or 1 representing a negabinary number.
   - `arr2` : int[] where each element is either 0 or 1 representing another negabinary number.
   
2. **Output Format:**
   - We need to return an int[] representing the sum of `arr1` and `arr2` in negabinary format.

3. **Example Inputs and Outputs:**
   - Example 1:
     - `arr1 = [1,1,1,1,0]`
     - `arr2 = [1,0,1]`
     - Output: `[1,0,0,0,0]`
     - Explanation: `(11110)_(-2) + (101)_(-2) = (10000)_(-2)`

### Strategy
1. **Initialization:**
   - Reverse `arr1` and `arr2` to process them from the least significant bit (rightmost digit).
   - Initialize `carry` to 0 and an empty list for the result.

2. **Iteration and Addition:**
   - Iterate over the maximum length of `arr1` and `arr2`.
   - For each corresponding bit, compute the sum of the bits and the current `carry`.
   - Determine the resulting bit and update the `carry`:
     - If the computed sum is 2, reset it to 0 and modify carry to -1 for handling negabinary properties.
     - If the computed sum is 3, reset it to 1 and modify carry to -1.
     - Handle cases where the sum becomes negative, specifically where the sum is -1.

3. **Final Carry Handling:**
   - Post iteration, if there's a non-zero carry, append it to the result.
   - Adjust for any additional carries that extend the result length.

4. **Cleanup:**
   - Remove any leading zeros from the reversed result array.
   - Reverse the result back to its correct order.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - Both `arr1` and `arr2` being zero.
   - Non-overlapping array lengths.

### Code
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public int[] addNegabinary(int[] arr1, int[] arr2) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int carry = 0, i = arr1.length - 1, j = arr2.length - 1;
        
        while (i >= 0 || j >= 0 || carry != 0) {
            int sum = carry;
            if (i >= 0) sum += arr1[i--];
            if (j >= 0) sum += arr2[j--];
            
            int resultBit = sum & 1; // sum % 2
            result.add(resultBit);
            carry = -(sum >> 1); // carry for negabinary
            
            // Adjust the carry if necessary
            if (carry < 0 && resultBit == 1) {
                carry++;
                int lastIndex = result.size() - 1;
                while (lastIndex >= 0 && result.get(lastIndex) == 0) lastIndex--;
                if (lastIndex >= 0 && result.get(lastIndex) == 1) {
                    result.set(lastIndex, 0);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Remove leading zeroes
        while (result.size() > 1 && result.get(result.size() - 1) == 0) {
            result.remove(result.size() - 1);
        }
        
        // Convert to array
        Collections.reverse(result);
        return result.stream().mapToInt(Integer::intValue).toArray();
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity: `O(max(n, m))`**:
  - Where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `arr1` and `arr2`. This is because we process each bit of the arrays and possible additional carries.
  
- **Space Complexity: `O(max(n, m))`**:
  - Result list can potentially grow larger than the input lists due to carries extending the result length.

This covers the problem statement, strategy, code, and time complexity for adding two negabinary numbers in Java.
