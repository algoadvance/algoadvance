[Leetcode 806. Number of Lines To Write String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l806)
## Problem Statement

You are given a list `widths`, where `widths[0]` is the width of 'a', `widths[1]` is the width of 'b', ..., and `widths[25]` is the width of 'z'. Given a string `s`, write it onto several lines such that each line has a maximum width of 100 units. You should pack your words in a greedy manner; that is, you want to pack as many words as possible in each line. Return an array `result` of length 2 where:

- `result[0]` is the total number of lines.
- `result[1]` is the width of the last line in units.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: 
widths = [10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10,10]
s = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
Output: [3, 60]
Explanation:
All letters have the same length of 10. To write all 26 letters,
we need two full lines (each with 100 units) and one line with 60 units.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are all characters in the string lowercase?
   - Yes, the string `s` consists only of lowercase English letters.
2. Should we consider any special or fringe cases in the string that might have non-alphabetic characters?
   - No, `s` will contain only characters from 'a' to 'z'.
3. Can the input string be empty?
   - Yes, an empty string is a valid input. In that case, the result should be `[0, 0]`.

## Strategy
1. Initialize `lines` to 1 because there's at least one line if the string is not empty.
2. Initialize `current_width` to 0 to keep track of the current line width.
3. Iterate over each character in the input string `s`:
   - Compute the width of the current character using the `widths` array.
   - If adding this character exceeds 100 units:
     - Increment the `lines` count.
     - Reset `current_width` to the width of the current character.
   - Otherwise, add the character's width to `current_width`.
4. Return the total `lines` and `current_width` (width of the last line).

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. We iterate through the string once, and all other operations (such as accessing the `widths` array) are O(1).

```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] numberOfLines(int[] widths, String s) {
        int lines = 1;
        int currentWidth = 0;
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            int width = widths[c - 'a'];
            
            if (currentWidth + width > 100) {
                lines++;
                currentWidth = width;
            } else {
                currentWidth += width;
            }
        }
        
        return new int[]{lines, currentWidth};
    }
}
```
