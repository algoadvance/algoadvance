[Leetcode 2169. Count Operations to Obtain Zero](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2169)
### Problem Statement

You are given two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2`.

In one operation, if `num1 >= num2`, you must subtract `num2` from `num1`, otherwise subtract `num1` from `num2`.

- For example, if `num1 = 5` and `num2 = 4`, subtract `num2` from `num1`, thus new values would be `num1 = 1` and `num2 = 4`. If `num1 = 4` and `num2 = 5`, subtract `num1` from `num2`, thus new values would be `num1 = 4` and `num2 = 1`.

Return the number of operations needed to make either `num1 = 0` or `num2 = 0`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What happens if both `num1` and `num2` are zero initially?**
   - If both values are zero, then the result should be zero operations.

2. **Are the inputs always valid integers?**
   - Yes, the problem guarantees that `num1` and `num2` are non-negative integers.

3. **Can both `num1` and `num2` be zero?**
   - Yes, if both are zero, zero operations are needed.

### Strategy

1. Initialize a counter `operations` to zero to keep track of the number of operations.
2. Use a loop to perform the operations until either `num1` or `num2` becomes zero:
   - If `num1 >= num2`, subtract `num2` from `num1`.
   - Otherwise, subtract `num1` from `num2`.
   - Increment the `operations` counter after each operation.
3. Return the `operations` counter.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int countOperations(int num1, int num2) {
        int operations = 0;
        
        while (num1 != 0 && num2 != 0) {
            if (num1 >= num2) {
                num1 -= num2;
            } else {
                num2 -= num1;
            }
            operations++;
        }
        
        return operations;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.countOperations(5, 4)); // Output: 5
        System.out.println(solution.countOperations(10, 10)); // Output: 1
        System.out.println(solution.countOperations(0, 5)); // Output: 1
        System.out.println(solution.countOperations(0, 0)); // Output: 0
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution can be analyzed as follows:

- Each operation reduces the value of `num1` or `num2` by at least one.
- The worst-case scenario would be subtracting `1` repetitively from `num1` or `num2`, which would take a maximum of `max(num1, num2)` operations.

Thus, the time complexity is O(max(num1, num2)).
