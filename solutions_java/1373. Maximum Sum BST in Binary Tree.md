[Leetcode 1373. Maximum Sum BST in Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1373)
### Problem Statement

You are given a binary tree with `n` nodes. Each node is represented by `TreeNode` which has three attributes: `val` (the integer value of this node), `left` (the left child `TreeNode`), and `right` (the right child `TreeNode`).

A subtree of a binary tree is considered a Binary Search Tree (BST) if:
- It is sorted in ascending order.
- All of its values are distinct.

Your task is to return the maximum sum of all keys of any subtree which is a Binary Search Tree.

**Example:**
```
Input: root = [1,4,3,2,4,2,5,null,null,null,null,null,null,4,6]
Output: 20
Explanation: The maximum sum of a BST subtree in the given tree is 20 (subtree rooted at 3 which includes 2, 4, 2, 5).
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **TreeNode Structure:** The problem assumes a certain `TreeNode` structure. Verify that we are using the structure `class TreeNode { int val; TreeNode left; TreeNode right; }`.
2. **Value Range:** What is the range of the values that can be stored in the nodes?
3. **Edge Cases:** Are there edge cases like an empty tree or a tree with only one node?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to:
1. Traverse each node in the binary tree.
2. At each node, determine if the subtree rooted at that node is a BST.
3. If it is a BST, calculate the sum of all nodes in the subtree.
4. Keep track of the maximum sum encountered.

We can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to determine if a subtree is a BST and to calculate the sum of its nodes. During the DFS traversal, we will return multiple values:
- If the subtree is a BST or not.
- The sum of the nodes if it is a BST.
- The minimum and maximum values in the subtree (to help in BST validation).

### Code

```java
public class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

public class Solution {
    private class ResultType {
        boolean isBST;
        int sum;
        int min;
        int max;
        
        ResultType(boolean isBST, int sum, int min, int max) {
            this.isBST = isBST;
            this.sum = sum;
            this.min = min;
            this.max = max;
        }
    }
    
    private int maxSum = 0;
    
    public int maxSumBST(TreeNode root) {
        dfs(root);
        return maxSum;
    }
    
    private ResultType dfs(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return new ResultType(true, 0, Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MIN_VALUE);
        }
        
        ResultType left = dfs(node.left);
        ResultType right = dfs(node.right);
        
        // Validate if current subtree is BST
        if (left.isBST && right.isBST && node.val > left.max && node.val < right.min) {
            int sum = node.val + left.sum + right.sum;
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, sum);
            
            return new ResultType(true, sum, Math.min(node.val, left.min), Math.max(node.val, right.max));
        } else {
            return new ResultType(false, 0, 0, 0);
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. We perform a DFS traversal of each node once to gather the necessary information.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(h)`, where `h` is the height of the tree. In the worst case, the height will be `O(n)` for a skewed tree. This is due to the recursion stack used during the DFS traversal.

This solution efficiently determines the maximum sum BST subtree rooted in any node of the given binary tree.
