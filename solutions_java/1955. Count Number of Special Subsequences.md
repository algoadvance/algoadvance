[Leetcode 1955. Count Number of Special Subsequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1955)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` containing integers. You need to count the number of increasing subsequences in the array that satisfy the condition: the subsequence consists of the numbers 0, 1, and 2 (in that order with any number of occurrences of 0, followed by any number of occurrences of 1, followed by any number of occurrences of 2).

**Example:**

```
Input: nums = [0,1,2,2]
Output: 4
Explanation: Special subsequences are [0,1,2], [0,1,2], [0,1,2,2], and [0,1,2,2].
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array be empty?**
   - Yes, but in this case, there are no subsequences, so the answer is 0.

2. **What should be done if there are no 0s or 1s in the array?**
   - If there are no 0s or 1s, itâ€™s impossible to form a subsequence that meets the criteria, so the answer would be 0.

3. **Are negative numbers or numbers greater than 2 possible in the array?**
   - According to the problem, only 0, 1, and 2 are considered for special subsequences.

### Strategy

The problem can be solved using dynamic programming by maintaining three counters:

1. `count_0`: Counts the number of ways to choose subsequences consisting only of 0s.
2. `count_01`: Counts the number of ways to choose subsequences consisting of 0s followed by 1s.
3. `count_012`: Counts the number of ways to choose subsequences consisting of 0s followed by 1s followed by 2s.

We will iterate through the array and update these counts accordingly:
- When encountering `0`, it can be either taken alone or appended to existing `count_0` subsequences.
- When encountering `1`, it can either start a new subsequence from existing `count_0`, or be appended to existing `count_01`.
- When encountering `2`, it can either be appended to existing `count_01` to form `count_012`, or be appended to existing `count_012`.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int countSpecialSubsequences(int[] nums) {
        int MOD = 1_000_000_007;
        // These variables will hold the count of specific subsequences
        long count0 = 0;
        long count01 = 0;
        long count012 = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == 0) {
                // We can start a new subsequence with 0, or append 0 to each of the existing 0 subsequences.
                count0 = (2 * count0 + 1) % MOD;
            } else if (num == 1) {
                // We can start a subsequence with 1 on the existing 0 subsequences, or attach 1 to each of the existing 01 subsequences.
                count01 = (2 * count01 + count0) % MOD;
            } else if (num == 2) {
                // We can append 2 to each of the existing 01/subsequences.
                count012 = (2 * count012 + count01) % MOD;
            }
        }
        return (int) count012;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`, because we process each element exactly once.

The space complexity is `O(1)` because we use a constant amount of space for the counters and do not require any additional space proportional to the input size.
