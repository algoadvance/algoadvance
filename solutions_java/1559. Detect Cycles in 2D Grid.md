[Leetcode 1559. Detect Cycles in 2D Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1559)
### Problem Statement
Given a 2D grid of characters, you need to determine if there is a cycle in the grid. A cycle is formed by a sequence of the same character in the grid such that:

1. The sequence contains at least four cells.
2. The path is a closed loop â€“ i.e., the first and the last cell are the same.
3. A cell can be visited only once in the sequence.

You can move in four possible directions: left, right, up, and down. The cycle must be formed only from cells containing the same character.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is diagonal movement allowed?**
   - No, you can only move up, down, left, and right.
2. **Can the grid contain any characters or only lowercase/uppercase letters?**
   - The grid contains lowercase English letters.
3. **Is it guaranteed that the grid will always contain at least one cell?**
   - Yes, the grid is non-empty.

### Strategy
1. **Cycle Detection with Depth-First Search (DFS):**
   - We'll use DFS to explore paths in the grid.
   - We'll maintain a visited grid to keep track of which cells have already been visited.
   - For each unvisited cell, start a DFS and look for cycles.
   - While performing DFS, we need to ensure that we do not revisit a cell immediately before the current cell (to prevent trivial cycles).
   - If we encounter a previously visited cell that isn't the parent of the current cell, then a cycle is detected.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    private int rows, cols;
    private int[][] directions = {{1, 0}, {-1, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, -1}};
    
    public boolean containsCycle(char[][] grid) {
        rows = grid.length;
        cols = grid[0].length;
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[rows][cols];
        
        for (int r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
            for (int c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
                if (!visited[r][c]) {
                    if (dfs(grid, visited, r, c, -1, -1)) {
                        return true;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    private boolean dfs(char[][] grid, boolean[][] visited, int r, int c, int pr, int pc) {
        visited[r][c] = true;
        
        for (int[] dir : directions) {
            int nr = r + dir[0];
            int nc = c + dir[1];
            
            // Continue if out of bounds or not the same character
            if (nr < 0 || nr >= rows || nc < 0 || nc >= cols || grid[nr][nc] != grid[r][c]) {
                continue;
            }
            
            // If the next cell is visited and not the parent, a cycle is detected
            if (visited[nr][nc]) {
                if (nr != pr || nc != pc) {
                    return true;
                }
            } else {
                // Not visited, perform DFS
                if (dfs(grid, visited, nr, nc, r, c)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(\text{rows} \times \text{cols})\)
  - Each cell is visited once, and the DFS explores each direction in constant time.
  
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(\text{rows} \times \text{cols})\)
  - Space for the visited grid.
  - Recursive stack space in the worst case.

This solution should be efficient for a grid of reasonable size, and its complexity ensures it performs well within typical constraints.
