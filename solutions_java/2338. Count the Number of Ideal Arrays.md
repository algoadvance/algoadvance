[Leetcode 2338. Count the Number of Ideal Arrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2338)
## Problem Statement
2338. Count the Number of Ideal Arrays

You are given two integers `n` and `maxValue`. An array `arr` of length `n` is called ideal if `1 <= arr[i] <= maxValue` for each `1 <= i <= n` and the absolute difference between any two adjacent elements is at most 1. 

Return the number of distinct ideal arrays. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of n and maxValue?
   - Consider this is within 1 and 10^5 for n and within 1 and 100.
2. Can we use any helper functions or libraries?
   - Standard Java libraries are permissible.

## Strategy
Given the constraints and properties of the array:
1. Use dynamic programming to calculate all possible counts of ideal arrays.
2. Use combinatorics to calculate the count efficiently.

The challenge is to handle the combination efficiently and correctly to fit within time constraints.

### Dynamic Programming Approach:
- Define `dp[k][i]` as the number of arrays of length `k` ending with the element `i`.
- Initialize the `dp[1][i]` for all valid `i` in range `[1, maxValue]` to 1.
- For each subsequent element, generate new counts based on previous values constrained by the absolute difference property.
- `dp[k][i]` should be calculated from `dp[k-1][i-1]`, `dp[k-1][i]`, and `dp[k-1][i+1]` while ensuring bounds.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of the solution should ideally be `O(n * maxValue)` due to nested loops iterating over the array and calculating the dp values.
- Space complexity will be similar, optimally `O(n * maxValue)` for the DP table.

Let's write the solution in Java.

```java
import java.util.*;

public class IdealArrayCounter {
    private static final int MOD = (int) 1e9 + 7;

    public int idealArrays(int n, int maxValue) {
        // DP table where dp[k][i] represents count of arrays of length k ending at value i
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][maxValue + 1];
        
        // Initialize dp[1][i] to 1, because all single element arrays of valid value i are ideal
        for (int i = 1; i <= maxValue; i++) {
            dp[1][i] = 1;
        }

        // Fill the dp table
        for (int k = 2; k <= n; k++) {
            for (int i = 1; i <= maxValue; i++) {
                dp[k][i] = dp[k - 1][i]; // element `i` coming from `i`

                if (i - 1 >= 1) {
                    dp[k][i] = (dp[k][i] + dp[k - 1][i - 1]) % MOD; // element `i` coming from `i-1`
                }

                if (i + 1 <= maxValue) {
                    dp[k][i] = (dp[k][i] + dp[k - 1][i + 1]) % MOD; // element `i` coming from `i+1`
                }
            }
        }

        // Sum up all arrays of length `n`
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i <= maxValue; i++) {
            result = (result + dp[n][i]) % MOD;
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        IdealArrayCounter counter = new IdealArrayCounter();
        // Test cases
        System.out.println(counter.idealArrays(2, 3)); // Expected output will be the count
        System.out.println(counter.idealArrays(3, 7)); // Expected output will be the count
    }
}
```

Above solution has implemented the dynamic programming approach to count the number of ideal arrays. In the `main` method, test cases can be executed to verify the correctness of the solution.

By precomputing results, this solution takes into account the constraint and uses modulo to handle large numbers.
