[Leetcode 1367. Linked List in Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1367)
### Problem Statement
**1367. Linked List in Binary Tree**

Given a binary tree `root` and a linked list with `head`, determine if there exists a path in the binary tree that is a downward path consisting of nodes that correspond to the sequence of values given in the linked list.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: head = [4,2,8], root = [1,4,4,null,2,2,null,1,null,6,8,null,null,null,null,1,3]
Output: true
Explanation: Nodes in the binary tree that contain values as per the linked list form the path 4 -> 2 -> 8.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the linked list be empty?
   - No, both root and head will contain at least one node as per the problem constraints.
2. What should be returned if there are multiple matching paths?
   - Return `true` if at least one matching path is found.
3. Does the path in the binary tree have to be from top to bottom with no branching?
   - Yes, the path must be downwards and continuous as per the definition provided.

### Strategy
1. We will recursively check if there's a path in the binary tree starting from any node that matches the linked list sequence.
2. We use two primary functions:
   - `isSubPath(head, root)` that checks if there's any start point in the binary tree that matches the sequence.
   - `checkPath(head, root)` that recursively checks if the current node continues to match the sequence in the linked list.

### Code

```java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

public class Solution {
    public boolean isSubPath(ListNode head, TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return false;
        }
        // Check if the current tree node matches the list starting from head
        if (checkPath(head, root)) {
            return true;
        }
        // Move to the left or right child to find the starting node of the path
        return isSubPath(head, root.left) || isSubPath(head, root.right);
    }
    
    private boolean checkPath(ListNode head, TreeNode root) {
        if (head == null) {
            return true; // All nodes in the linked list are matched
        }
        if (root == null) {
            return false; // Reached the end of a branch in the tree without matching the list
        }
        if (head.val != root.val) {
            return false; // The current values do not match
        }
        // Continue to check for the next nodes in both the linked list and binary tree
        return checkPath(head.next, root.left) || checkPath(head.next, root.right);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- `isSubPath` traverses every node in the binary tree: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree.
- `checkPath` potentially checks every subtree rooted at each node where the tree traversal starts. In the worst-case scenario, this can check every path of length up to M, where M is the length of the linked list.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity can be considered as O(N * M) in the worst case because we will potentially start a new checkPath from each node in the binary tree.

This complexity aligns with a brute-force approach which is reasonable given the constraints.
