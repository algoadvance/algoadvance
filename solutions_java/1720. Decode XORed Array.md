[Leetcode 1720. Decode XORed Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1720)
### Problem Statement

You are given the **encoded** array `encoded` of length `n` and an integer `first`. You need to find the original array `arr` that was used to generate the `encoded` array.

The `encoded` array is created using the **XOR** operation as follows:
- `encoded[i] = arr[i] ^ arr[i + 1]` for `i >= 0`.

Given:
- An integer `first`.
- An integer array `encoded` of length `n` (where `n` is at least 1).

You need to return the original array `arr` of length `n + 1` where `arr[0] = first`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Is the length of the `encoded` array guaranteed to be at least 1?
   - Yes, it's guaranteed to be at least 1.
2. Can the `encoded` array contain negative numbers?
   - No, it contains non-negative integers.
3. Is the `first` integer guaranteed to be within a specific range?
   - `first` can be any non-negative integer within the range of typical 32-bit integers.

### Strategy

To decode the `encoded` array:
1. Initialize an array `arr` where the length is `n + 1`.
2. Set the first element of `arr` as `first`.
3. Iterate through the `encoded` array, use the property of XOR to compute the original value:
   - XOR has a property that `a ^ b = c` implies `a = c ^ b`.
   - Therefore, `arr[i] = encoded[i-1] ^ arr[i-1]`.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] decode(int[] encoded, int first) {
        int n = encoded.length;
        int[] arr = new int[n + 1];
        arr[0] = first;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            arr[i + 1] = encoded[i] ^ arr[i];
        }
        
        return arr;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the `encoded` array. This is because we iterate through each element of the `encoded` array exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the `arr` array of size `n + 1`.

This solution efficiently decodes the XORed array using a straightforward iteration and XOR operations.
