[Leetcode 1023. Camelcase Matching](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1023)
### Problem Statement:
Given an array of `queries` and a `pattern`, you have to determine if each query matches the given pattern. A query matches a pattern if all the uppercase letters in the pattern appear in the same order in the query, and every uppercase letter in the query either matches an uppercase letter in the pattern or is an extra uppercase letter.

Return a boolean array `res` of the same length as `queries`, where `res[i]` is true if `queries[i]` matches `pattern`, and false otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What is the length range for `queries` and `pattern`?**
   - The length for each query and the pattern: from `1` to `100`.
   - The number of queries: from `1` to `100`.

2. **What type of characters are used in the `queries` and `pattern`?**
   - Both uppercase and lowercase English letters are used.

3. **Is the ordering of characters in `pattern` and `queries` significant?**
   - Yes, the uppercase letters in the `pattern` should appear in the same order in each query.

4. **Can there be extra uppercase or lowercase letters in the queries?**
   - Yes, but the uppercase letters in the query need to match the uppercase letters in the pattern in the same order.

### Strategy:
1. For each query, check if it matches the `pattern`.
2. Use two pointers: one for the query string (`q_idx`) and one for the pattern (`p_idx`).
3. While iterating through the query:
   - If the character in the query matches the current character in the pattern, move both pointers.
   - If the character in the query does not match and is lowercase, simply move the pointer in the query.
   - If the character in the query does not match and is uppercase, this query cannot match the pattern.
4. At the end of the query, check if all characters in the pattern were matched.
5. Return the results for all queries.

### Code:
```java
import java.util.*;

public class CamelcaseMatching {
    public List<Boolean> camelMatch(String[] queries, String pattern) {
        List<Boolean> results = new ArrayList<>();
        for (String query : queries) {
            results.add(matches(query, pattern));
        }
        return results;
    }

    private boolean matches(String query, String pattern) {
        int p_idx = 0;
        for (int q_idx = 0; q_idx < query.length(); q_idx++) {
            if (p_idx < pattern.length() && query.charAt(q_idx) == pattern.charAt(p_idx)) {
                p_idx++;
            } else if (Character.isUpperCase(query.charAt(q_idx))) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return p_idx == pattern.length();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CamelcaseMatching solution = new CamelcaseMatching();
        String[] queries = {"FooBar", "FooBarTest", "FootBall", "FrameBuffer", "ForceFeedBack"};
        String pattern = "FB";
        System.out.println(solution.camelMatch(queries, pattern));
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- Iterating over each query: O(N), where N is the length of the query.
- Each character in the pattern and query comparison: O(L), where L is the length of the query string.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(M * L), where M is the number of queries and L is the maximum length of a query string.
