[Leetcode 1943. Describe the Painting](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1943)
### Problem Statement
We have a long canvas where the x-coordinates range from negative infinity to positive infinity. Initially, the canvas is entirely white. We have several range operations represented by a 2D array `paintings`, where each `paintings[i] = [start_i, end_i, color_i]` means that we paint all points in the range `[start_i, end_i)` (including `start_i` but not `end_i`) with color `color_i`.

Given the `paintings` array, we want to describe the painting process as a collection of range operations in a new format such as `[start, end, color]`, but we should not have overlapping ranges and each range should be a maximal range that is uniformly colored after all the painting operations have been completed.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can there be overlapping ranges in `paintings`?**
   - Yes, multiple paint operations can overlap.
2. **What should happen if multiple paint operations overlap?**
   - The most recent paint operation takes precedence.

### Strategy
1. **Break Down the Problem**: Each range `[start_i, end_i)` can potentially overlap with other ranges, and we need to ensure the final output does not have any overlapping ranges.
2. **Use a Sweep Line Algorithm**: We'll utilize the concept of a sweep line algorithm which processes all the start and end points of the painting operations.
   - Track changes at each start and end point using events.
   - Use a sorted map or array to keep track of how many times we encounter each color at any given point.
3. **Construct the Result**: After processing all the events, construct the final non-overlapping ranges.

### Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.TreeMap;

public class Solution {
    public List<List<Long>> splitPainting(int[][] paintings) {
        TreeMap<Long, Integer> colorChanges = new TreeMap<>();
        for (int[] painting : paintings) {
            colorChanges.put((long) painting[0], colorChanges.getOrDefault((long) painting[0], 0) + painting[2]);
            colorChanges.put((long) painting[1], colorChanges.getOrDefault((long) painting[1], 0) - painting[2]);
        }
        
        List<List<Long>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        long previousPosition = 0;
        long previousColor = 0;
        long currentColor = 0;
        for (Map.Entry<Long, Integer> entry : colorChanges.entrySet()) {
            long position = entry.getKey();
            if (previousColor != 0 && previousColor != currentColor) {
                List<Long> segment = new ArrayList<>();
                segment.add(previousPosition);
                segment.add(position);
                segment.add(currentColor);
                result.add(segment);
            }
            currentColor += entry.getValue();
            previousPosition = position;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Events Processing**: O(N log N) due to sorting of keys in the TreeMap.
- **Result Construction**: O(N) as we simply iterate through the sorted keys once.

Where `N` is the number of painting operations.

This ensures that we handle even large ranges effectively and maintain an efficient algorithm that scales well with the input size.
