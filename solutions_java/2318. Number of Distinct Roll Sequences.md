[Leetcode 2318. Number of Distinct Roll Sequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2318)
### Problem Statement

2318. Number of Distinct Roll Sequences

You are given an integer `n`. You need to return the number of distinct sequences of rolls of a die of length `n` that satisfy the following conditions:
- At least one value must appear at least `x` times.
- Two consecutive values cannot be the same.
- There cannot be a sequence of three adjacent turns with the same value 3 times each.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are there any constraints on the values of `n` and `x`?
2. What would be the output if `n=0` or `x=0`?
3. Do we need to take care of integer overflow with the results?

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Setup**: Use dynamic programming to keep track of the last two rolls and count of each dice face.
2. **State Representation**: `dp[i][j][k]` where:
   - `i` denotes the index in the sequence.
   - `j` denotes the last value rolled.
   - `k` denotes the count of consecutive rolls of the same value.
3. **Transition**: Manage transitions based on the defined constraints (no consecutive same rolls and no three adjacent turns repeating).
4. **Initialization and Base Case**: Initialize the base cases for the first roll and incrementally build up to `n`.
5. **Result Composition**: Summarize the counts of all valid sequences satisfying the constraints.

Let's move on to the implementation in Java.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int distinctRollSequences(int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        if (n == 1) return 6;

        final int MOD = 1000000007;
        int[][][] dp = new int[n+1][7][7];

        // Initial population for the first roll
        for (int i = 1; i <= 6; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= 6; ++j) {
                if (i != j) {
                    dp[2][i][j] = 1;
                }
            }
        }

        for (int i = 3; i <= n; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= 6; ++j) {
                for (int k = 1; k <= 6; ++k) {
                    if (j == k) continue;
                    for (int m = 1; m <= 6; ++m) {
                        if (j != m && k != m) {
                            dp[i][j][k] = (dp[i][j][k] + dp[i-1][m][j]) % MOD;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        int result = 0;
        for (int j = 1; j <= 6; ++j) {
            for (int k = 1; k <= 6; ++k) {
                if (j != k) {
                    result = (result + dp[n][j][k]) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int output = solution.distinctRollSequences(4); // Example input
        System.out.println(output);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is `O(n * 6 * 6 * 6)` which simplifies to `O(n)` since we are performing constant operations for each step up to `n`. Given that the constraints fit within reasonable bounds when considering performance, this ensures our approach will efficiently compute the required sequences.
