## Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 1330: Reverse Subarray To Maximize Array Value

**Description**:
Given an integer array `nums`, you can choose exactly one subarray of `nums` and reverse it. Return the maximum possible value of the array after reversing the chosen subarray.

The value of the array is defined as the sum of `abs(nums[i] - nums[i+1])` for all `0 <= i < nums.length - 1`.

**Example**:
```
Input: nums = [2,3,1,5,4]
Output: 10
Explanation: By reversing the subarray [3,1,5], the array becomes [2,5,1,3,4] with value 10.
```

**Constraints**:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 3 * 10^4`
- `-10^5 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can we choose any subarray, including the entire array, for reversal?
   - **A**: Yes, you can choose any subarray, including the entire array.

2. **Q**: Can the input array contain both positive and negative numbers?
   - **A**: Yes, the input array can contain both positive and negative numbers within the given constraints.

3. **Q**: Should the code handle edge cases such as arrays with length 1?
   - **A**: Yes, the code should handle edge cases, such as when the array has only one element, where no reversal is needed.

## Strategy

The strategy to solve this problem involves the following steps:

1. Calculate the initial value of the array before any reversal.
2. Explore the effect of reversing different types of subarrays.
3. Maximizing the change in value obtained by reversing subarrays involving extreme values (since reversing subarrays with the largest and smallest values can have the most significant impact on adjacent differences).
4. Keep track of the best possible value obtained after such reversals.

Specifically:
- Calculate the sum of absolute differences for the array as it is.
- Consider edge impacts when reversing subarrays such as the first element or the last element.
- Consider the maximum potential swap by reversing every possible subarray and calculating the new value each time.
- Use derived patterns and optimizations to avoid recomputation and improve efficiency.

## Code

Here's the implementation for solving this problem based on the strategy:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxValueAfterReverse(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        
        if (n == 1) return 0; // No reversal needed for a single element array
        
        // Calculate the initial array value
        int originalValue = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            originalValue += Math.abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]);
        }
        
        int maxDiff = 0;
        int totalValue = originalValue;
        
        // Check edge cases where reversing affects the first or last element.
        for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
            // Reversing subarrays involving the first or last element.
            maxDiff = Math.max(maxDiff, Math.abs(nums[0] - nums[i + 1]) - Math.abs(nums[i] - nums[i + 1]));
            maxDiff = Math.max(maxDiff, Math.abs(nums[n - 1] - nums[i - 1]) - Math.abs(nums[i] - nums[i - 1]));
        }
        
        // Check general mid-subarray reversals
        int min2 = Integer.MAX_VALUE, max2 = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
            min2 = Math.min(min2, Math.max(nums[i], nums[i + 1]));
            max2 = Math.max(max2, Math.min(nums[i], nums[i + 1]));
        }
        
        maxDiff = Math.max(maxDiff, 2 * (max2 - min2));
        
        return totalValue + maxDiff;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the `nums` array. This is because we iterate through the array a fixed number of times to calculate the original value and determine the maximum difference possible by reversing subarrays.
