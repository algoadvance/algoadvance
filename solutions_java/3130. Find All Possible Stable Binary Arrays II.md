[Leetcode 3130. Find All Possible Stable Binary Arrays II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3130)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n`, which represents the length of a binary array. A binary array is an array consisting of only 0s and 1s. You need to find all possible "stable" binary arrays of length `n`.

A binary array is considered stable if, for any two consecutive elements in the array, the sum of those two elements is no more than 1. In other words:
- The combination `11` is not allowed in the array.

Your task is to write a function that returns a list of all possible stable binary arrays of length `n`.

### Example
- Input: `n = 3`
- Output: `[ [0,0,0], [0,0,1], [0,1,0], [1,0,0], [1,0,1] ]`

## Clarifying Questions
1. If `n` is 0, what should be the output?
   - The output should be an empty list since there are no arrays of length 0.
2. Are there any constraints on `n`?
   - The problem statement doesn't explicitly state any constraints, but assuming typical problem constraints, `0 <= n <= 20` should be reasonable.

## Strategy

1. **Backtracking Approach**: We will use a backtracking approach to generate all possible arrays while immediately discarding arrays that do not satisfy the stability condition (no two consecutive 1s).
2. **Recursive Function**: We'll write a recursive function to build the array step-by-step:
   - At each step, decide whether to append `0` or `1` to the current array.
   - If a `1` is added, ensure that the previous element was not a `1`.
   - Once we reach the length `n`, add the array to our list of stable arrays.
3. **Base Case**: When the length of the current array is equal to `n`, the array is complete and we add it to the result list.

## Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class StableBinaryArrays {
    public static List<List<Integer>> findAllStableBinaryArrays(int n) {
        List<List<Integer>> results = new ArrayList<>();
        if (n == 0) {
            return results;
        }
        generateArrays(new ArrayList<>(), n, results);
        return results;
    }

    private static void generateArrays(List<Integer> current, int n, List<List<Integer>> results) {
        if (current.size() == n) {
            results.add(new ArrayList<>(current));
            return;
        }
        
        current.add(0);
        generateArrays(current, n, results);
        current.remove(current.size() - 1);
        
        if (current.isEmpty() || current.get(current.size() - 1) != 1) {
            current.add(1);
            generateArrays(current, n, results);
            current.remove(current.size() - 1);
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 3;
        List<List<Integer>> stableArrays = findAllStableBinaryArrays(n);
        for (List<Integer> array : stableArrays) {
            System.out.println(array);
        }
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(2^n)`. In the worst case, we generate all possible arrays of length `n` which is `2^n` combinations. However, due to the restriction (no consecutive `1`s), the number of valid combinations is generally less than `2^n`.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(n * 2^n)` for storing the results since each valid array can be up to length `n`.
