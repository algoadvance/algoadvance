[Leetcode 1263. Minimum Moves to Move a Box to Their Target Location](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1263)
## Problem Statement
You are given a grid of size `m x n` with the following values:
- `'S'` represents the starting point of the character.
- `'T'` represents the target location of the box.
- `'#'` represents an obstacle.
- `'.'` represents an empty cell.
- `'B'` represents the location of the box.

The character can only push the box if it is next to it in one of the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right) and if the cell on the opposite side of the box in that direction is empty.

Your goal is to move the box to the target location with the least number of moves. Return the minimum number of moves required to do so. If it is impossible to move the box to the target location, return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are diagonal moves allowed?**
    - No, only moves in the four cardinal directions (up, down, left, and right) are allowed.
  
2. **Can the box move through the character, or does it need a direct empty path?**
    - The box requires a direct empty path to move.

3. **Is there a guarantee that 'S', 'T', and 'B' will always be within the bounds of the grid?**
    - Yes, the problem guarantees they will be within the grid bounds.

4. **Are multiple test cases to be handled, or just one?**
    - We should assume a single test case as specified in the problem.

## Strategy
The approach to solve this problem includes:
1. **BFS for Shortest Path:** We will use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to systematically explore the minimal moves the character can make to position themselves correctly to push the box.
2. **State Representation:** Each state in our BFS will be represented by the position of the box and the character.
3. **Visitation Tracking:** We need to track visited states to avoid redundant computations and cycles.
4. **Valid Moves:** At each state, consider if the character can move around the box, and whether it can push the box towards any of the four directions into an empty cell.

The BFS will simulate all possible states starting from the initial positions until the box reaches the target position.

            {'#', '.', '#', '#', '#', '#'},
            {'#', '.', '.', '.', 'S', '#'},
            {'#', '#', '#', '#', '#', '#'}

}
```

## Time Complexity
1. **BFS Traversal for Moves:** The BFS runs with complexity `O((m * n)^2)`, where each state is represented by the position of the box and character.
2. **Reachability Check (`canReach`):** For each move, the player's reachability check runs with complexity `O(m * n)`.

Given this, the overall time complexity is `O((m * n)^3)` where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid. This is due to the BFS states exploration and additional reachability checks.
