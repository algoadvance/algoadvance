[Leetcode 1234. Replace the Substring for Balanced String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1234)
### Problem Statement:
You are given a string containing only the characters 'Q', 'W', 'E', and 'R'. Your task is to replace the minimum length contiguous substring of the given string such that the frequency of each character becomes equal.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What is the maximum length of the input string?
    - Are there any corner cases (like an empty string) that we need to handle?

2. **Output:**
    - Should the output be the length of the substring or the substring itself?

3. **Equality Ideal:**
    - Should the frequency of each 'Q', 'W', 'E', 'R' character be exactly equal to each other after replacing the substring?

### Strategy:
To solve this problem, we can utilize the sliding window technique to efficiently find the minimum length of the substring that needs to be replaced to balance the string. We can describe our approach in the following steps:

1. **Initial Setup:**
    - Calculate the frequency of each character ('Q', 'W', 'E', 'R') in the initial string.
    - Determine the ideal frequency of each character which is `n / 4`, where `n` is the length of the string.

2. **Sliding Window Approach:**
    - Use two pointers (`start` and `end`) to represent the window and slide the window over the string.
    - Maintain a count of characters that exceed their ideal frequency and try to minimize the window size that allows us to balance the string.

3. **Optimization:**
    - As we slide the window, keep updating the minimum length of the window that can be replaced to balance the string's character frequencies.

### Code:
Hereâ€™s the Java implementation of the described strategy:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class ReplaceSubstringForBalancedString {
    public int balancedString(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int k = n / 4;
        
        // Count the frequency of each character
        Map<Character, Integer> count = new HashMap<>();
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            count.put(c, count.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }

        // Check if we already have a balanced string
        if (count.getOrDefault('Q', 0) == k && count.getOrDefault('W', 0) == k 
                && count.getOrDefault('E', 0) == k && count.getOrDefault('R', 0) == k) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Sliding window
        int minLength = n;
        int start = 0;
        for (int end = 0; end < n; end++) {
            char endChar = s.charAt(end);
            count.put(endChar, count.getOrDefault(endChar, 0) - 1);
            
            while (start < n && count.getOrDefault('Q', 0) <= k && count.getOrDefault('W', 0) <= k
                    && count.getOrDefault('E', 0) <= k && count.getOrDefault('R', 0) <= k) {
                minLength = Math.min(minLength, end - start + 1);
                char startChar = s.charAt(start);
                count.put(startChar, count.getOrDefault(startChar, 0) + 1);
                start++;
            }
        }

        return minLength;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ReplaceSubstringForBalancedString sol = new ReplaceSubstringForBalancedString();
        String str = "QQWE";
        System.out.println(sol.balancedString(str)); // Output: 1
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Preprocessing:** The frequency counting takes O(n) time.
- **Sliding Window:** Each character is processed at most twice (once when extending the window end and once when shrinking the window start), making this O(n) time.

Overall, the time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the length of the string. This solution is efficient and ensures that we find the minimum length of the substring to balance the string.
