[Leetcode 2867. Count Valid Paths in a Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2867)
### Problem Statement

You are given a tree (an undirected acyclic graph) with `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and `n - 1` edges.

Given integer `n`, and a 2D array `edges` of length `n-1` where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i]` means there is an undirected edge between nodes `u_i` and `v_i`.

A "valid path" in a tree is a path that does not contain any repeated nodes. You need to return the total number of valid paths in the tree.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the nodes always labelled from 0 to n-1?**
   - Yes.

2. **What is the maximum value for `n`?**
   - Typically constraints are given, but let's assume `n` could be as large as \(10^5\) for this problem.

3. **Are the edges bidirectional?**
   - Yes, the edges are undirected.

4. **Is a path starting and ending at the same node considered a valid path?**
   - No, we assume valid paths have unique nodes and so start and endpoints cannot be the same.

### Strategy

1. **Tree Properties**:
   - Since itâ€™s a tree with `n-1` edges and no cycles, it is inherently connected.
   - Any two nodes can have one unique path between them.

2. **DFS or BFS**:
   - Perform DFS (Depth-First Search) to count all paths originating from each node.

3. **Counting Paths**:
   - Each edge in a tree can be seen as part of paths from every pair of nodes in its two disjoint subtrees.
   - Calculate sub-tree sizes to use combinatorial counting.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    private int n;
    private List<List<Integer>> graph;
    private long result;

    public long countValidPaths(int n, int[][] edges) {
        this.n = n;
        this.graph = new ArrayList<>(n);
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            graph.get(u).add(v);
            graph.get(v).add(u);
        }
        
        // Using trees's property where size of subtree and its complement is considered
        result = 0;
        int[] subtreeSizes = new int[n];
        dfs(0, -1, subtreeSizes);
        
        return result;
    }

    private int dfs(int node, int parent, int[] subtreeSizes) {
        int subtreeSize = 1;
        
        for (int neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
            if (neighbor != parent) {
                int sizeOfSubtree = dfs(neighbor, node, subtreeSizes);
                result += (long) sizeOfSubtree * (n - sizeOfSubtree);
                subtreeSize += sizeOfSubtree;
            }
        }
        
        subtreeSizes[node] = subtreeSize;
        return subtreeSize;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int n = 5;
        int[][] edges = {{0, 1}, {0, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4}};
        System.out.println(sol.countValidPaths(n, edges));  // Output should match the expected answer
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **DFS Traversal**: \(O(n)\)
  - Each node and edge is visited exactly once.
  
- **Overall Complexity**: \(O(n)\)

This approach efficiently counts all valid paths in the tree by leveraging properties of trees and combinatorial counting from subtree sizes.
