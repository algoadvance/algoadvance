[Leetcode 2855. Minimum Right Shifts to Sort the Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2855)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array `nums` of `n` unique integers. You can perform the following operation on the array any number of times:

* Rotate the array to the right by one position.

Return the minimum number of right shifts needed to sort the array in non-decreasing order. If it's not possible to sort the array using the above operation, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Will the array always have unique integers?
   **A**: Yes, the problem states that the integers in the array are unique.

2. **Q**: What is the definition of a right shift?
   **A**: A right shift means taking the last element of the array and moving it to the first position (like rotating the array).

3. **Q**: Should the array be sorted in strictly increasing order?
   **A**: No, it should be sorted in non-decreasing order which allows for repeated elements. However, since the array has unique integers, strictly increasing order is implicated.

4. **Q**: Can we assume that the input array will be valid with length `n â‰¥ 0`?
   **A**: Yes, valid array lengths ranging from `0` to `n`.

### Strategy
To determine the minimum number of right shifts to sort the array, or whether it's impossible, follow these steps:

1. **Identify the pivot**: An array can be sorted by right shifts if there's exactly one place (pivot) where the array transitions from the largest element to the smallest. For instance, in `[4, 5, 1, 2, 3]`, the pivot is at 2, where `5` is followed by `1`.

2. **Validation**: After identifying the pivot index, determine if the array rotated to start from the pivot would be sorted in non-decreasing order.

3. **Count shifts**: The necessary shifts to rotate the array starting from the pivot to the end of the array is equal to the length of the array minus the pivot index.

4. **Edge Cases**: Consider cases where the array is already sorted or cases where no such pivot exists, meaning it is impossible to sort with rotations.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int minimumRightShifts(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;

        // Check if the array is already sorted
        boolean isSorted = true;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) {
                isSorted = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (isSorted) return 0;

        // Identify pivot
        int pivot = -1;
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[i + 1]) {
                if (pivot != -1) {
                    return -1; // More than one pivot means it's unsortable by rotations
                }
                pivot = i;
            }
        }

        // No pivot found means array is strictly increasing or completely unsortable
        if (pivot == -1) return -1;

        // Validate if the array can be sorted by rotating from the found pivot
        for (int i = pivot + 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[i + 1]) {
                return -1;
            }
        }
        if (nums[n - 1] > nums[0]) {
            return -1;
        }

        // Return the number of right shifts needed
        return n - 1 - pivot;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array. We traverse the array a few times to both identify potential pivot points and validate the sorted order.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, as no extra space proportional to the input size is used.
