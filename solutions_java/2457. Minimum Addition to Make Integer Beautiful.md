[Leetcode 2457. Minimum Addition to Make Integer Beautiful full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2457)
### Problem Statement

Given two positive integers `n` and `target`, an integer `n` is considered beautiful if the sum of its digits is less than or equal to `target`. You are tasked with finding the minimum non-negative integer that should be added to `n` to make it beautiful.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the range of values for `n` and `target`?
   - Can `n` be 0?
   - Is `target` always non-negative?

2. **Output**:
   - Should the output be the minimum integer to add making `n` beautiful, or the resulting beautiful number itself?

Assuming typical LeetCode constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 10^12`
- `1 <= target <= 150`

### Strategy

1. **Digit Sum Calculation**: 
   - First, we need a helper function to calculate the sum of digits of a number.

2. **Check Beautiful Condition**:
   - If the sum of digits of `n` is already less than or equal to `target`, return 0.

3. **Determine the Minimum Addition**:
   - Keep adding the smallest value that turns part of `n` to zero from the least significant digit upwards to reduce its digit sum.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    
    // Calculate the sum of digits of a number
    private int digitSum(long num) {
        int sum = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            sum += num % 10;
            num /= 10;
        }
        return sum;
    }
    
    public long makeIntegerBeautiful(long n, int target) {
        if(digitSum(n) <= target) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        long increment = 1;
        long answer = 0;
        
        while (digitSum(n) > target) {
            // Get the last digit
            long lastDigit = n % 10;
            // The increment needed to turn this digit into zero in next iteration
            long addToMakeZero = 10 - lastDigit;
            
            n += addToMakeZero;
            answer += addToMakeZero * increment;
            increment *= 10;
            // Because we add less than 10, digit change only affects sum's near carry
        }
        
        return answer;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        
        System.out.println(sol.makeIntegerBeautiful(16, 6)); // Example test
        System.out.println(sol.makeIntegerBeautiful(467, 6)); // Example test
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Digit Sum Calculation**: O(log(n))
  - The digit sum calculation loops through each digit, which takes log(n) time as there are log10(n) digits.
- **Main Algorithm**: O((log(n))^2)
  - In the worst case, the while loop runs around log10(n) times, and for each iteration, we are computing the digit sum, leading to an overall complexity of O((log(n))^2).

This approach ensures efficiency even for large values of `n` up to 10^12. This combined strategy ensures we can find the minimal addition by effectively handling carry-over propagation.
