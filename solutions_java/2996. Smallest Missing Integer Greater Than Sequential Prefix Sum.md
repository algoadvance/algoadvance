[Leetcode 2996. Smallest Missing Integer Greater Than Sequential Prefix Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2996)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of positive integers `nums`, find the smallest missing positive integer greater than the sum of the first `i` elements for each prefix sum. The result should be the smallest integer that cannot be formed by the sum of the prefix elements plus these integers.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should the function return if the array is empty?**
   - If the array is empty, the smallest missing positive integer would be `1`.

2. **Can there be duplicate elements in the array?**
   - Yes, there can be duplicate elements in the array.

3. **Is there any upper limit on the size of the array or the values within it?**
   - For practical purposes, we can assume the array can be large, and values are positive integers within reasonable computational limits.

### Strategy

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
   - Calculate the prefix sum as we iterate through the array. This step doesn't require an auxiliary list; we can maintain a running total.
   
2. **Finding the Smallest Missing Integer**:
   - The key observation is that if we can form every integer from `1` to the current prefix sum, the next integer we canâ€™t form with the given prefix is the prefix sum plus `1`.
   - Iterate through each element, keeping track of the prefix sum.
   - At each step, check if the current element can help form new integers up to the current prefix sum.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the array is empty, we should return `1`.
   - If the smallest missing positive integer is larger than any prefix sum found by the end of the array.

### Code

```java
public class SmallestMissingInteger {
    public int findSmallestMissing(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 0) {
            return 1;
        }
        
        int prefixSum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num > prefixSum + 1) {
                break;
            }
            prefixSum += num;
        }
        
        return prefixSum + 1;
    }
}

// Example usage:
// SmallestMissingInteger solution = new SmallestMissingInteger();
// int result = solution.findSmallestMissing(new int[]{1, 1, 2, 5, 3});
// System.out.println(result);  // Output: 13
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array `nums`. We only make a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no extra space is used apart from a few variables for tracking the prefix sum.

This approach is efficient and leverages a simple scan through the array to solve the problem.
