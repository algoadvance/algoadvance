[Leetcode 1887. Reduction Operations to Make the Array Elements Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1887)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of positive integers, you must perform reduction operations to reduce all elements to the same value. In each reduction operation, you may do the following for any existing value `x`.

- Choose any element `nums[i]` of the array.
- Change `nums[i]` to any value strictly smaller than `nums[i]`.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make all the elements of the array equal.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the array guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, it is guaranteed that the array is non-empty.
   
2. **Are all elements positive integers?**
   - Yes, all elements are positive integers.

3. **Can the given array be modified, or do I need to keep the original array unchanged?**
   - You can modify the array if needed during the process.

4. **What are the constraints on the size of the array?**
   - The size of the array isn't explicitly defined here, but typical constraints would be `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5` and `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`.

### Strategy

To minimize the number of operations:

1. **Sort the array**: This will help in efficiently finding where and how many times reductions need to be applied.
2. **Count distinct elements and their positions**: We need to count moves for each element to turn it into the next smaller distinct element.
3. **Sum up the operations**: Calculate the total number of operations needed for all reductions.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class ReductionOperations {
    public int reductionOperations(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        
        int operations = 0;
        int length = nums.length;
        
        // Traverse the sorted array from the second to last element down to the first
        for (int i = length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
            // If the current element is different from the previous one,
            // all the elements from this point onwards need to be reduced in one additional operation each
            if (nums[i] != nums[i-1]) {
                operations += length - i;
            }
        }
        
        return operations;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ReductionOperations solution = new ReductionOperations();
        
        int[] nums1 = {5,1,3};
        System.out.println(solution.reductionOperations(nums1)); // Expected: 3
        
        int[] nums2 = {1,1,1};
        System.out.println(solution.reductionOperations(nums2)); // Expected: 0
        
        int[] nums3 = {1,1,2,2,3};
        System.out.println(solution.reductionOperations(nums3)); // Expected: 4
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the array**: \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Iterating through the array**: \(O(n)\)

Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), predominantly due to the sorting operation.

### Explanation

1. **Sorting**: We sort the array so that the largest elements come at the end.
2. **Counting operations**: Starting from the end of the array:
   - Each time we encounter a new number (different from the previous one), it means a new "level" of reductions starts.
   - We accumulate the count of operations needed for all subsequent larger elements to be reduced to this level.

This way, we efficiently calculate the total number of reduction operations required.
