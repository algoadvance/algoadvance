[Leetcode 1450. Number of Students Doing Homework at a Given Time](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1450)
### Problem Statement

Given two integer arrays `startTime` and `endTime` and an integer `queryTime`. `startTime[i]` and `endTime[i]` represent the start and end times of the `i-th` student's homework session, respectively. Return the number of students doing their homework at `queryTime`. More formally, return the number of students where `queryTime` lays in the interval `[startTime[i], endTime[i]]` inclusive.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the arrays `startTime` and `endTime` of the same length?**
   - Yes, each `startTime[i]` corresponds to an `endTime[i]` of the same student.

2. **Is `queryTime` guaranteed to be within the range of typical start and end times?**
   - Yes, you can assume `queryTime` values are reasonable as per the usual constraints defined in such problems.

3. **What are the constraints on the length of the arrays, and the values within them?**
   - Given the problem constraints on LeetCode, typically:
     - `1 <= startTime.length == endTime.length <= 1000`
     - `1 <= startTime[i] <= endTime[i] <= 1000`
     - `1 <= queryTime <= 1000`

### Code

```java
public class HomeworkChecker {
    public int busyStudent(int[] startTime, int[] endTime, int queryTime) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < startTime.length; i++) {
            if (startTime[i] <= queryTime && queryTime <= endTime[i]) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HomeworkChecker checker = new HomeworkChecker();
        
        int[] startTime = {1, 2, 3};
        int[] endTime = {3, 2, 7};
        int queryTime = 4;
        
        System.out.println(checker.busyStudent(startTime, endTime, queryTime));  // Should print 1
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialization of Counter**:
   - Initialize a variable `count` to zero. This will keep track of the number of students doing homework at `queryTime`.

2. **Iterate Through `startTime` and `endTime`**:
   - Iterate through the arrays. For each student (each index `i`), check if `queryTime` is within the interval `[startTime[i], endTime[i]]`.

3. **Condition Check**:
   - If `startTime[i] <= queryTime` and `queryTime <= endTime[i]`, increment the `count`.

4. **Return the Result**:
   - After iterating through all the students, return the `count` as the result.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`
  - Where `n` is the length of the arrays `startTime` and `endTime`. The solution involves a single loop through these arrays.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
  - The space used is constant, as we are only using a few integer variables regardless of the input size.

This straightforward approach ensures efficient calculation with minimal overhead, making it suitable given the problem constraints.
