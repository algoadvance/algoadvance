[Leetcode 975. Odd Even Jump](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l975)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `A`. From some starting index, you can make a series of jumps. The (1st, 3rd, 5th, ...) jumps in the series are called odd-numbered jumps, and the (2nd, 4th, 6th, ...) jumps in the series are called even-numbered jumps. During an odd-numbered jump, you are allowed to jump to the smallest index `j` (with `j > i`) such that `A[i] ≤ A[j]`. During an even-numbered jump, you are allowed to jump to the largest index `j` (with `j > i`) such that `A[i] ≥ A[j]`. Note that `i` cannot be the same as `j`.

Return the number of starting indices from which you can reach the end of the array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should we return if the array is empty or has one element?**
   - If the array is empty, return 0. If the array has one element, you can always reach the end from the start, so return 1.

2. **What type of values does the array contain?**
   - The array contains integers, which can be positive, negative, or zero.

3. **Can elements in the array be duplicated?**
   - Yes, elements in the array can be duplicated.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - We need to keep track of valid jumps for each position depending on whether the jump is odd or even.
   - We initialize two boolean arrays `odd` and `even` where `odd[i]` means it is possible to reach the end from index `i` via an odd jump, and `even[i]` means it is possible to reach the end from index `i` via an even jump.

2. **Monotonic Stack**:
   - To efficiently find the next index for odd and even jumps, we can use a monotonic stack while iterating over the sorted indices based on the values in the array.

3. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - We propagate the ability to reach the end backward using the information from future indices.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int oddEvenJumps(int[] A) {
        int N = A.length;
        if (N <= 1) return N;

        boolean[] odd = new boolean[N];
        boolean[] even = new boolean[N];
        odd[N - 1] = even[N - 1] = true;

        TreeMap<Integer, Integer> map = new TreeMap<>();
        map.put(A[N - 1], N - 1);

        for (int i = N - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
            Integer oddJump = map.ceilingKey(A[i]);
            Integer evenJump = map.floorKey(A[i]);

            if (oddJump != null)
                odd[i] = even[map.get(oddJump)];
            if (evenJump != null)
                even[i] = odd[map.get(evenJump)];

            map.put(A[i], i);
        }

        int result = 0;
        for (boolean b : odd) {
            if (b) result++;
        }
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting Indices**: The sorting step operates in `O(N log N)`.
- **Single Pass for Monotonic Stack**: The consecutive steps utilizing a monotonic stack are `O(N)`.
- **Dynamic Programming Update**: A single pass to update the boolean arrays is `O(N)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(N log N)`.
