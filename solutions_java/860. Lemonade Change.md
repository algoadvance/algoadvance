[Leetcode 860. Lemonade Change](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l860)
### Problem Statement

Suppose you are running a lemonade stand. Customers are standing in a queue to buy from you and order one cup of lemonade each. Each lemonade costs $5. Customers can only pay with a $5, $10, or $20 bill. You must provide the correct change to each customer so that the net transaction leaves you with appropriate denominations for future customers. Return `true` if you can provide every customer with correct change, and `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**
```java
Input: [5,5,5,10,20]
Output: true
Explanation: 
From the first 3 customers, we collect three $5 bills in order.
From the fourth customer, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5.
From the fifth customer, we give a $10 bill and a $5 bill.
Since all the customers got correct change, we output true.
```

**Example 2:**
```java
Input: [5,5,10]
Output: true
```

**Example 3:**
```java
Input: [10,10]
Output: false
```

**Example 4:**
```java
Input: [5,5,10,10,20]
Output: false
Explanation: 
From the first two customers, we collect two $5 bills.
For the next two customers, we collect a $10 bill and give back a $5 bill.
For the last customer, we cannot give the change of $15 back because we only have two $10 bills.
Since not every customer received the correct change, the answer is false.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: What should we return if the input list is empty?**
   - A: You should return `true` because there are no customers, so no change needs to be made.

2. **Q: Are there constraints on the number of bills or length of the `bills` array?**
   - A: Constraints are typically such that the input size is manageable within a reasonable time frame for execution.

3. **Q: Can we assume inputs are always valid and strictly follow the mentioned denominations?**
   - A: Yes, you can assume the input list strictly contains 5, 10, and 20.

### Strategy

1. Use counters to track the number of $5 and $10 bills you have.
2. Iterate over each bill in the `bills` array:
   - If a customer pays with a $5 bill, increment the $5 bill counter.
   - If a customer pays with a $10 bill, check if you have a $5 bill for change. If yes, decrement your $5 bill counter and increment the $10 bill counter. If not, return `false`.
   - If a customer pays with a $20 bill, check if you have a $10 bill and a $5 bill for change first. If so, decrement both counters. If not, check if you have three $5 bills for change. If you don't have enough change, return `false`.
3. If you successfully give change to all customers, return `true`.

### Code

```java
public class LemonadeChange {
    public boolean lemonadeChange(int[] bills) {
        int fiveCount = 0, tenCount = 0;
        
        for (int bill : bills) {
            if (bill == 5) {
                fiveCount++;
            } else if (bill == 10) {
                if (fiveCount == 0) {
                    return false;
                }
                fiveCount--;
                tenCount++;
            } else { // bill == 20
                if (tenCount > 0 && fiveCount > 0) {
                    tenCount--;
                    fiveCount--;
                } else if (fiveCount >= 3) {
                    fiveCount -= 3;
                } else {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LemonadeChange lc = new LemonadeChange();
        int[] bills1 = {5, 5, 5, 10, 20};
        System.out.println(lc.lemonadeChange(bills1)); // true
        int[] bills2 = {5, 5, 10};
        System.out.println(lc.lemonadeChange(bills2)); // true
        int[] bills3 = {10, 10};
        System.out.println(lc.lemonadeChange(bills3)); // false
        int[] bills4 = {5, 5, 10, 10, 20};
        System.out.println(lc.lemonadeChange(bills4)); // false
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of elements in the `bills` array. This is because we are iterating through each bill exactly once and performing constant time operations within the loop.
