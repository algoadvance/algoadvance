[Leetcode 959. Regions Cut By Slashes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l959)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `grid` representing a matrix. Each element of `grid` can be one of three characters:
- `' '` (a space), which represents an empty cell,
- `'/'` (a forward slash), which represents a division between regions,
- `'\ '` (a backslash), which represents a division between regions.

We need to determine the number of regions formed by the slashes in the grid.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Grid Dimensions**: Should we assume the grid to be a square matrix?
   - Yes, the grid is always a square matrix with dimensions `n x n`.
  
2. **Character Validity**: Are we guaranteed that each element will be either `' '`, `'/'`, or `'\ '`?
   - Yes, each element in the grid will be one of these three characters.
   
3. **Output Requirements**: Should we output the number of regions as an integer value?
   - Yes, the output should be the number of regions as an integer.

### Strategy
1. **Sub-grid Expansion**: Treat each cell in the `grid` as a 3x3 mini-grid:
    - A `space` (' ') will remain as it is.
    - A `forward slash` ('/') will map to:
      ```
      [0, 0, 1]
      [0, 1, 0]
      [1, 0, 0]
      ```
    - A `back slash` ('\') will map to:
      ```
      [1, 0, 0]
      [0, 1, 0]
      [0, 0, 1]
      ```

2. **Union-Find/DFS/BFS Approach**: To count distinct regions in this expanded grid, we can use either Union-Find or DFS/BFS for connected component counting on the graph formed by this expanded min-grid.

### Code
Here is the Java implementation using DFS:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int regionsBySlashes(String[] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        int expandedSize = n * 3;
        int[][] expandedGrid = new int[expandedSize][expandedSize];

        // Convert the grid to the expanded form
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            char[] chars = grid[i].toCharArray();
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                char c = chars[j];
                if (c == '/') {
                    expandedGrid[i * 3][j * 3 + 2] = 1;
                    expandedGrid[i * 3 + 1][j * 3 + 1] = 1;
                    expandedGrid[i * 3 + 2][j * 3] = 1;
                } else if (c == '\\') {
                    expandedGrid[i * 3][j * 3] = 1;
                    expandedGrid[i * 3 + 1][j * 3 + 1] = 1;
                    expandedGrid[i * 3 + 2][j * 3 + 2] = 1;
                }
            }
        }

        // Count the number of regions using DFS
        int regions = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < expandedSize; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < expandedSize; j++) {
                if (expandedGrid[i][j] == 0) {
                    regions++;
                    dfs(expandedGrid, i, j);
                }
            }
        }
        return regions;
    }

    private void dfs(int[][] grid, int r, int c) {
        int n = grid.length;
        if (r < 0 || r >= n || c < 0 || c >= n || grid[r][c] != 0) {
            return;
        }
        grid[r][c] = 1;
        dfs(grid, r - 1, c);
        dfs(grid, r + 1, c);
        dfs(grid, r, c - 1);
        dfs(grid, r, c + 1);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Grid Expansion**: Converting the original `n x n` grid into an `expandedSize x expandedSize` grid where `expandedSize = 3 * n` takes O(n^2) time.
- **DFS Traversal**: The DFS traversal will visit each cell exactly once, which is O((3n)^2) = O(9n^2) = O(n^2) time.

**Overall Time Complexity**: O(n^2)
