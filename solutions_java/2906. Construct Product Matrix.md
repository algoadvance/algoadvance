[Leetcode 2906. Construct Product Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2906)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integer matrices `A` and `B` of dimensions `m x n` and `p x q` respectively. You need to implement a function `constructProduct(int[][] A, int[][] B)` that returns the matrix product of `A` and `B`.

Matrix multiplication is defined only if the number of columns in `A` equals the number of rows in `B` (i.e., `n == p`). The resulting matrix will have dimensions `m x q`. The element at position `(i, j)` in the resulting matrix is computed as the dot product of the i-th row of `A` and the j-th column of `B`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Validation**: Should the function handle cases where matrix dimensions are incompatible for multiplication?
2. **Empty Matrices**: Should we consider empty matrices as input?
3. **Edge Cases**: Is it possible to receive matrices with zeros only?

Assuming that:
- The input matrices `A` and `B` are valid and compatible for multiplication.
- Matrices are not empty.

### Strategy

1. **Matrix Dimensions**: 
   - Let `A` be of size `m x n`.
   - Let `B` be of size `p x q`.
   - Matrix multiplication is possible if `n == p`.
   - The resulting matrix will be of size `m x q`.

2. **Multiplication Algorithm**:
   - Initialize a matrix `C` of size `m x q` with all elements as 0.
   - Use three nested loops: 
     - Outer loop over rows of `A` (i from 0 to m-1).
     - Middle loop over columns of `B` (j from 0 to q-1).
     - Inner loop for computing the dot product (k from 0 to n-1):
       - Accumulate the product `A[i][k] * B[k][j]` into `C[i][j]`.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public static int[][] constructProduct(int[][] A, int[][] B) {
        int m = A.length;      // Number of rows in A
        int n = A[0].length;   // Number of columns in A
        int p = B.length;      // Number of rows in B (should be equal to n)
        int q = B[0].length;   // Number of columns in B

        // Initialize the resulting matrix with dimensions m x q
        int[][] C = new int[m][q];

        // Perform the matrix multiplication
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < q; j++) {
                for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
                    C[i][j] += A[i][k] * B[k][j];
                }
            }
        }

        return C;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this algorithm is O(m * n * q).
  - Outer loop runs `m` times.
  - Middle loop runs `q` times.
  - Inner loop runs `n` times.

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(m * q) to store the resulting matrix `C`.

Ensure to verify the dimensions of matrices in real implementation to avoid dimension mismatch errors.
