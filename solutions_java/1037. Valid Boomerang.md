[Leetcode 1037. Valid Boomerang](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1037)
### Problem Statement:
Given an array `points` where `points[i] = [xi, yi]` represents a point on the X-Y plane, return `true` if these points form a boomerang (a set of three points that are not all on the same line). Otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Size**: Is it guaranteed that the input will always contain exactly three points?
    - Yes, the problem guarantees that the input will always have exactly three points.
2. **Data Type**: What are the ranges and types for the coordinates?
    - Each coordinate [xi, yi] is an integer.
3. **Output Format**: Should the output be strictly boolean?
    - Yes, the output should be a boolean value (`true` or `false`).

### Strategy:
1. **Understanding Collinearity**: Three points \( (x1, y1) \), \( (x2, y2) \), and \( (x3, y3) \) are collinear if they lie on the same straight line. This happens if the slope between each pair of points is the same:
   - Slope between \( (x1, y1) \) and \( (x2, y2) \) is \( \frac{y2 - y1}{x2 - x1} \)
   - Slope between \( (x1, y1) \) and \( (x3, y3) \) is \( \frac{y3 - y1}{x3 - x1} \)

2. **Avoid Division for Slope**: To avoid division (and potential division by zero errors), we can use a cross-multiplication approach to determine collinearity:
   - Points are collinear if \( (y2 - y1) * (x3 - x1) = (y3 - y1) * (x2 - x1) \)

3. **Implementation**: Calculate the left-hand side (LHS) and right-hand side (RHS) of the above equation and return `false` if they are equal (indicating collinearity) and `true` otherwise.

### Java Code:
```java
public class ValidBoomerang {
    public boolean isBoomerang(int[][] points) {
        int x1 = points[0][0], y1 = points[0][1];
        int x2 = points[1][0], y2 = points[1][1];
        int x3 = points[2][0], y3 = points[2][1];

        int lhs = (y2 - y1) * (x3 - x1);
        int rhs = (y3 - y1) * (x2 - x1);

        return lhs != rhs;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ValidBoomerang vb = new ValidBoomerang();
        int[][] points1 = // use example from above
        int[][] points2 = // use example from above

        System.out.println(vb.isBoomerang(points1)); // true
        System.out.println(vb.isBoomerang(points2)); // false
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(1)
  - The algorithm performs a constant number of arithmetic operations regardless of the input values. Therefore, it takes constant time.

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The algorithm uses a constant amount of space for variables to store the coordinates and intermediate calculations.
