[Leetcode 138. Copy List with Random Pointer full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l138)
## Problem Statement
A linked list is given such that each node contains an additional random pointer, which could point to any node in the list or `null`.

Return a deep copy of the list.

The Linked List is represented by a node class with attributes:
- `Node.val` (from 0 to 1000)
- `Node.next` (a pointer to the next node, or null)
- `Node.random` (a pointer to any node in the list, or null)

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are the `val` attributes guaranteed to be unique?
2. Can the `random` pointer also point to `null`?
3. Should we assume the input might be an empty linked list?

## Strategy
The problem can be approached by creating a new node for each original node and setting up the appropriate `next` and `random` pointers. We'll split the process into three main steps:

1. **Step 1: Clone the Nodes**: Create new nodes and insert them just next to the original nodes. This way, for each original node, we will have a new node immediately following it.
2. **Step 2: Set Up Random Pointers**: Iterate through the modified list and set the `random` pointers for the new nodes.
3. **Step 3: Separate the Lists**: Finally, separate the new nodes from the original nodes to form the new list.

## Code

Here's the implementation in Java:

```java
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    int val;
    Node next;
    Node random;

    public Node(int val) {
        this.val = val;
        this.next = null;
        this.random = null;
    }
}

public class Solution {

    public Node copyRandomList(Node head) {
        if (head == null) return null;

        // Step 1: Create new nodes and add them next to original nodes
        Node iter = head;
        while (iter != null) {
            Node newNode = new Node(iter.val);
            newNode.next = iter.next;
            iter.next = newNode;
            iter = newNode.next;
        }

        // Step 2: Set the random pointers of the new nodes
        iter = head;
        while (iter != null) {
            if (iter.random != null) {
                iter.next.random = iter.random.next;
            }
            iter = iter.next.next;
        }

        // Step 3: Separate the original list and the new list
        iter = head;
        Node newHead = head.next;
        while (iter != null) {
            Node newNode = iter.next;
            iter.next = newNode.next;
            iter = iter.next;
            if (newNode.next != null) {
                newNode.next = newNode.next.next;
            }
        }

        return newHead;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(N)\), where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because we traverse the list a constant number of times (three passes). 

1. First pass: Create new nodes inserted among original nodes.
2. Second pass: Set the random pointers for the new nodes.
3. Third pass: Separate the new list from the original list.

## Space Complexity
The space complexity is \(O(1)\) because no additional space proportional to the input size is used; we are modifying the existing list structure.
