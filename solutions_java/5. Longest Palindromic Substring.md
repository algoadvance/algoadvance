[Leetcode 5. Longest Palindromic Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l5)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, return the longest palindromic substring in `s`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
   - Are there any constraints on the type of characters in `s` (e.g., only lowercase English letters)?

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - If there are multiple substrings with the same maximum length, is any one of them acceptable to return?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should be returned if the string is empty?
   - What should be returned if the string has only one character?

### Strategy
To solve the problem efficiently, we can use the "Expand Around Center" approach. The idea is to consider every possible center of the palindrome (considering both odd-length and even-length centers) and expand outwards to find the longest palindromic substring for each center.

1. **Initialize:** 
   - Initialize a variable to keep track of the start and end indices of the longest palindrome found.

2. **Expand Around Center:** 
   - For each character in the string, consider it as the center of an odd-length palindrome.
   - For each pair of consecutive characters, consider them as the center of an even-length palindrome.
   - For each center, expand outwards as long as the substring remains a palindrome.

3. **Update the Longest Palindrome:**
   - Keep track of the maximum length palindrome found so far and update the start and end indices accordingly.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - Finally, return the substring using the start and end indices.

This approach ensures we check all potential palindromic centers and efficiently find the longest one.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public String longestPalindrome(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.length() < 1) return "";
        
        int start = 0, end = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            int len1 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i); // Odd-length palindromes
            int len2 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i + 1); // Even-length palindromes
            int len = Math.max(len1, len2);
            if (len > end - start) {
                start = i - (len - 1) / 2;
                end = i + len / 2;
            }
        }
        return s.substring(start, end + 1);
    }

    private int expandAroundCenter(String s, int left, int right) {
        while (left >= 0 && right < s.length() && s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)) {
            left--;
            right++;
        }
        return right - left - 1;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is O(n^2), where n is the length of the input string. This is because for each character, we expand around the center for potentially all characters (both for odd-length and even-length palindromes).

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1). No extra space proportional to the input size is used; only a few variables for indexing and calculation are utilized.
