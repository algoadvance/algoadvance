[Leetcode 1849. Splitting a String Into Descending Consecutive Values](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1849)
### Problem Statement

The problem "Splitting a String Into Descending Consecutive Values" from LeetCode requires us to determine whether a given numeric string can be split into descending consecutive values. 

More formally, given a string `s` consisting of only digits, return `true` if it is possible to split the string into one or more non-empty substrings such that:

1. Each substring represents an integer,
2. The integers in the list are in strictly descending order,
3. The difference between any two consecutive integers is exactly 1.

Example:
- Input: `s = "1234"`
  Output: `false`

- Input: `s = "050043"`
  Output: `true`
  Explanation: We can split the string into "50", "49", "48", and "47".

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any leading zeroes in the substrings?**
   - Yes, the input string can contain leading zeroes.
   
2. **What is the maximum length of the input string?**
   - The length of the input string `s` will be in the range `[1, 50]`.

3. **Should we consider empty substrings?**
   - No, all substrings should be non-empty.

4. **Is it possible to split the string into exactly one substring?**
   - No, the problem requires at least two substrings to form a valid sequence.

### Strategy

We will employ a backtracking approach to solve this problem:

1. **Initial Step:** We start by trying every possible first substring up to half of the stringâ€™s length for potential efficiency gains.
2. **Recursive Step:** After choosing the first substring, convert it to an integer and continue the process to verify if the remaining string can form a sequence of descending consecutive values.
3. **Base Case:** If we reach the end of the string and have successfully split into sequences of consecutive descending integers, return `true`.
4. **Edge Case:** If the length of the candidate descending integer is greater than the length of the remaining string, the split is not possible.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean splitString(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n / 2; i++) {
            long firstNumber = Long.parseLong(s.substring(0, i));
            if (backtrack(s, i, firstNumber)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
    
    private boolean backtrack(String s, int index, long previousNumber) {
        if (index == s.length()) {
            return true;
        }
        
        for (int i = index + 1; i <= s.length(); i++) {
            long currentNumber = Long.parseLong(s.substring(index, i));
            if (currentNumber == previousNumber - 1) {
                if (backtrack(s, i, currentNumber)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.splitString("050043"));  // true
        System.out.println(sol.splitString("1234"));    // false
        System.out.println(sol.splitString("9080701")); // false
        System.out.println(sol.splitString("10009998")); // true
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above solution can be analyzed as follows:
- The outer loop iterates from `1` to `n/2`, considering different lengths for the first substring.
- The recursive backtrack function explores potential splits for the remaining part of the string, leading to multiple recursive calls.

In the worst case, this results in a time complexity of approximately \(O(n^2 \log n)\) due to the recursive depth and substring parsing. However, since the problem gives a manageable string length range, this approach is feasible.
