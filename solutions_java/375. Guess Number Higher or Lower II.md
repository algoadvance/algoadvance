[Leetcode 375. Guess Number Higher or Lower II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l375)
## Problem Statement:
We are playing the Guessing Game. The game works as follows:

- I pick a number between `1` and `n`.
- You have to guess which number I picked.
- Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower.
- However, when you guess a particular number `x`, and you guess wrong, you pay `x` dollars.

Given a particular `n`, return the minimum amount of money you need to guarantee a win, regardless of which number I pick.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **What is the range of `n`?**  
   Let's assume `1 ≤ n ≤ 200`.

2. **Is this a dynamic programming problem?**  
   Yes, this problem can be approached using dynamic programming.

3. **Do we consider the cost of correct guesses?**  
   No, only the cost of incorrect guesses is considered.

4. **Are the guesses sequential or can they be in any order?**  
   The guesses can be in any order, but we need to find a strategy that minimizes the total cost.

## Strategy:
1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**  
   - Define `dp[i][j]` as the minimum cost required to guess the right number in the range `[i, j]`.
   - Base Case:  
     - If `i == j`, `dp[i][j] = 0`, because no cost is incurred if the range has only one number.
     - If `i > j`, `dp[i][j] = 0`, because it's an invalid range.
   - Recursive Step:  
     - For each possible guess `k` in the range `[i, j]`, the cost we pay is `k + max(dp[i][k-1], dp[k+1][j])`. This is because if we guess `k`, the cost is `k`. If the actual number is lower we need to pay `dp[i][k-1]`, if it's higher we pay `dp[k+1][j]`.
     - We strive to minimize this maximum cost.

2. **Implementation in Java:**

```java
public class Solution {

    public int getMoneyAmount(int n) {
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][n + 1];
        
        for (int length = 2; length <= n; length++) {
            for (int i = 1; i <= n - length + 1; i++) {
                int j = i + length - 1;
                dp[i][j] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
                for (int k = i; k < j; k++) {
                    int cost = k + Math.max(dp[i][k - 1], dp[k + 1][j]);
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], cost);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[1][n];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.getMoneyAmount(10)); // Example test case
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n^3)\) due to the three nested loops:
1. The outermost loop iterates over the length of the ranges.
2. The second loop iterates over the starting point `i` of the range.
3. The innermost loop iterates over all possible guesses `k` within the range `[i, j]`.

Since we are considering all subranges and possible guesses for these subranges, the cubic complexity is justified. This is acceptable given the constraint \( n \leq 200 \).
