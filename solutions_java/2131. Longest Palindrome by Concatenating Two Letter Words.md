[Leetcode 2131. Longest Palindrome by Concatenating Two Letter Words](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2131)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of strings `words` where each string is a two-letter word, you need to find the longest possible palindrome you can construct by concatenating some of those strings in any order. Each string in the input `words` can be used at most once in the concatenated string.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the input size or limit?**
   - The number of words in the array `words` can be up to 10^5.
   
2. **Are all strings in the array guaranteed to have exactly two characters?**
   - Yes, each string in the array `words` will be a two-letter word.

3. **What should be returned?**
   - You should return the length of the longest palindrome that can be constructed.

## Strategy

1. **Understand the Problem:**
   - We need to build the longest palindrome possible using two-letter words.
   - A palindrome reads the same forwards and backwards.

2. **Plan:**
   - Use a `HashMap` to count occurrences of each word.
   - For each word `w` in the array:
     - If the reversed word of `w` exists in the map, it can potentially form a part of the palindrome.
     - Consider special cases where the word is the same when reversed (e.g., "aa").

3. **Implementation Details:**
   - Traverse through the `words` array and populate the frequency map.
   - Use the frequency map to determine how to pair words to form the palindrome.

4. **Constructing the Palindrome:**
   - For each word "ab":
     - Try to match it with its reverse "ba".
     - Count pairs that contribute to the palindrome.
   - For words like "aa", count the maximum even pairs and remember that one odd "aa" can be the center of the palindrome.

## Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public int longestPalindrome(String[] words) {
        HashMap<String, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int palindromeLen = 0;
        int oddPalindromeCenter = 0;
        
        for (String word : words) {
            String reversed = new StringBuilder(word).reverse().toString();
            if (map.getOrDefault(reversed, 0) > 0) {
                palindromeLen += 4;
                map.put(reversed, map.get(reversed) - 1);
            } else {
                map.put(word, map.getOrDefault(word, 0) + 1);
            }
        }
        
        for (String word : map.keySet()) {
            if (word.charAt(0) == word.charAt(1) && map.get(word) > 0) {
                oddPalindromeCenter = 2;
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return palindromeLen + oddPalindromeCenter;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        String[] words1 = {"lc", "cl", "gg"};
        System.out.println(sol.longestPalindrome(words1));  // Output: 6
        
        String[] words2 = {"ab", "ty", "yt", "lc", "cl", "ab"};
        System.out.println(sol.longestPalindrome(words2));  // Output: 8
        
        String[] words3 = {"cc", "ll", "xx"};
        System.out.println(sol.longestPalindrome(words3));  // Output: 2
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Building the Frequency Map:** O(n), where `n` is the number of words.
- **Checking Palindrome Contributions:** O(n), mostly involves simple hashmap operations which are average O(1).
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n).

This approach efficiently ensures that we consider all possible valid palindrome contributions from the given two-letter words.
