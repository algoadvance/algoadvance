[Leetcode 2139. Minimum Moves to Reach Target Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2139)
### Problem Statement:

You are playing a game with integers. You start with the integer `1` and you want to reach the integer `target` using the least number of moves. 

In one move, you can do one of the following:
1. Increment the current integer by one (i.e., `current += 1`).
2. Double the current integer (i.e., `current *= 2`).

Given an integer `target`, return the minimum number of moves needed to reach `target` starting with `1`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q: Is `target` always a positive integer?**
   - **A: Yes, `target` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.**

2. **Q: Are we allowed to exceed `target` while calculating our moves?**
   - **A: No, the goal is to reach exactly `target` using the minimum number of moves.**

3. **Q: Can `target` be 1?**
   - **A: Yes, `target` can be 1. In such cases, we are already at the target, so no moves are required.**

### Strategy:

To solve this problem, we can consider that moving backward from the `target` to `1` can sometimes simplify the solution:
1. If `target` is even, the optimal move would most likely have been a division by 2.
2. If `target` is odd, the optimal move would have been a subtraction by 1.

By reversing the process (moving from `target` to `1` instead of from `1` to `target`), we can systematically reduce the `target`:
- If `target` is even, divide it by 2.
- If `target` is odd, subtract 1.

We continue this process until we reach `1`, counting the moves as we go.

### Code:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minMoves(int target) {
        int moves = 0;
        
        while (target > 1) {
            if (target % 2 == 0) {
                target /= 2;
            } else {
                target -= 1;
            }
            moves++;
        }
        
        return moves;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this solution is `O(log(target))` because, in the worst case, we are performing operations that reduce the size of the number approximately by half each time (for even numbers) or by one (for odd numbers), leading to a logarithmic reduction in the size of the `target`.

This ensures that the solution is efficient even for very large values of `target`.
