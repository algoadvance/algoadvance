[Leetcode 1758. Minimum Changes To Make Alternating Binary String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1758)
### Problem Statement

Given a binary string `s`, you need to find the minimum number of character flips required to make the string alternating. An alternating binary string is a string where no two adjacent characters are the same. For example, "010101" and "101010" are alternating binary strings. You need to return the minimum number of flips required.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What's the length of the string?**
   - The length can vary; it's not specified in the problem, but it should be within reasonable limits typically seen in coding challenges.
   
2. **What characters does the string contain?**
   - The string contains only characters '0' and '1'.
   
3. **Can the string be empty?**
   - According to typical constraints, the string should have at least one character.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, consider these two possible alternating patterns:

1. "010101..." (starting with '0')
2. "101010..." (starting with '1')

For each pattern, we count the number of positions where the actual character in the string `s` does not match the expected character in the pattern. The minimum count between these two results will be the minimum number of flips required to make the string alternating.

### Code

Here is the code to implement the solution in Java:

```java
public class MinimumFlipsToAlternatingString {
    public int minFlips(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int flips1 = 0; // For pattern '010101...'
        int flips2 = 0; // For pattern '101010...'
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            char expectedCharPattern1 = (i % 2 == 0) ? '0' : '1';
            char expectedCharPattern2 = (i % 2 == 0) ? '1' : '0';
            
            if (s.charAt(i) != expectedCharPattern1) flips1++;
            if (s.charAt(i) != expectedCharPattern2) flips2++;
        }
        
        return Math.min(flips1, flips2);
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumFlipsToAlternatingString solution = new MinimumFlipsToAlternatingString();
        
        System.out.println(solution.minFlips("01001001101")); // Example test case
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. This is because we iterate through each character of the string once to evaluate whether it matches the expected character in both potential alternating patterns.

### Explanation

1. **Initialize two counters:** `flips1` and `flips2` to count mismatches for both patterns.
2. **Loop through each character in the string:**
    - Determine the expected character for both patterns at the current index.
    - Increment the respective counter if the character does not match the pattern's expected character.
3. **Return the minimum of the two counters:** which gives the minimum number of flips required.
