[Leetcode 949. Largest Time for Given Digits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l949)
### Problem Statement
Given an array `arr` of 4 digits, find the largest 24-hour time that can be made. The smallest 24-hour time is `00:00`, and the largest is `23:59`. The starting time must be formatted as "HH:MM".

If no valid time can be made, return an empty string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the digits always guaranteed to form a valid time?**
   - No, it is possible that the digits cannot form a valid time, in which case we should return an empty string.

2. **Are there any digits outside the range [0-9]?**
   - No, the problem states that the array consists of valid digits only, within the range 0-9.

3. **Is it acceptable to use sorting or permutation methods to solve this problem?**
   - Yes, any valid method can be used as long as it adheres to the constraints and efficiently finds the solution.

### Strategy
1. **Generate Permutations**:
   - We can generate all permutations of the array `arr` to consider every possible combination of the digits.

2. **Validate Time**:
   - For each permutation, we need to check if it can form a valid time in the `HH:MM` format.
   - Valid hours range from `00` to `23` and valid minutes range from `00` to `59`.

3. **Keep Track of the Maximum Time**:
   - Convert valid times to minutes since `00:00` and keep track of the permutation that yields the largest time.

4. **Return the Largest Time**:
   - Finally, convert the largest time found back into the `HH:MM` format and return it. If no valid time is found, return an empty string.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public String largestTimeFromDigits(int[] arr) {
        List<List<Integer>> permutations = new ArrayList<>();
        permute(arr, 0, permutations);

        String maxTime = "";
        int maxMinutes = -1;

        for (List<Integer> perm : permutations) {
            int hours = perm.get(0) * 10 + perm.get(1);
            int minutes = perm.get(2) * 10 + perm.get(3);
            if (hours < 24 && minutes < 60) {
                int totalMinutes = hours * 60 + minutes;
                if (totalMinutes > maxMinutes) {
                    maxMinutes = totalMinutes;
                    maxTime = String.format("%02d:%02d", hours, minutes);
                }
            }
        }

        return maxTime;
    }

    private void permute(int[] arr, int start, List<List<Integer>> permutations) {
        if (start == arr.length) {
            List<Integer> perm = new ArrayList<>();
            for (int num : arr) {
                perm.add(num);
            }
            permutations.add(perm);
        } else {
            for (int i = start; i < arr.length; i++) {
                swap(arr, start, i);
                permute(arr, start + 1, permutations);
                swap(arr, start, i); // backtrack
            }
        }
    }

    private void swap(int[] arr, int i, int j) {
        int temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[j];
        arr[j] = temp;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] digits1 = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        int[] digits2 = {5, 5, 5, 5};
        System.out.println(sol.largestTimeFromDigits(digits1)); // Expected "23:41"
        System.out.println(sol.largestTimeFromDigits(digits2)); // Expected ""
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Permutation Generation**: Generating permutations takes O(4!) time, as we are permuting 4 digits.
- **Validation**: For each of the 24 permutations, we validate the time. Validation is O(1) since it involves a few mathematical operations.
- **Overall**: The overall time complexity is O(4!) which evaluates to O(24), a constant time complexity since the input size is fixed at 4 digits. Hence, the solution is efficient.

### Space Complexity
- **Space for storing permutations**: We store O(4!) permutations where each permutation is of size 4. So the space complexity is O(24) which is also constant as the input size is fixed.

This solution effectively generates all possible times and selects the largest valid one in a computationally efficient manner.
