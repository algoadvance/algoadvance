[Leetcode 1354. Construct Target Array With Multiple Sums](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1354)
### Problem Statement
Given an array `target` of n integers, you can do the following operations on the array any number of times:

1. Choose any subarray of the array and remove it.
2. Divide the sum of the subarray by 2.

Return `true` if it is possible to create the array from an array filled with only ones.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the target array contain negative numbers?**
   No, the target array will only contain positive integers.
   
2. **Is the goal to reach an array of all ones exactly?**
   Yes, the goal is to determine if we can transform the array to an array of all ones using the described operations.

3. **Is there a constraint on the array size?**
   There will be constraints but the exact size isn't specified. We should assume it can be relatively large, let's say up to 10^5 elements.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to reverse-engineer the process. Here's a detailed strategy:

1. **Use a Max-Heap**: Use a max-heap (priority queue) to always operate on the largest element of the array. This helps in simulating the reversal of the operations efficiently.

2. **Iterate Until Valid**: Continue removing the largest element, subtract the remaining sum of the array from this element (this simulates the operation done in reverse), and push the resultant value back into the max-heap.

3. **Check Validity**:
   - If the largest element is 1, we can simply keep reducing others to 1 as well.
   - If the sum of the rest of the elements (`sum - max_element`) is 0 or negative but `max_element` is greater than 1, it is invalid (as all elements being ones would sum up to `1*n`).

4. **Optimization**:
   - Ensure valid number calculation by checking modulo operations and avoid infinite loops by ensuring the reduced value is larger than zero.

### Code
```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;
import java.util.Collections;

public class Solution {
    public boolean isPossible(int[] target) {
        if (target.length == 1) return target[0] == 1;
        
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        long sum = 0;
        
        // Add all elements to the heap and calculate the total sum.
        for (int n : target) {
            maxHeap.add(n);
            sum += n;
        }
        
        while (true) {
            int max = maxHeap.poll();
            sum -= max;
            
            // Return true if we can replace the remaining array with all 1s
            if (max == 1 || sum == 1) return true;

            // Invalid case
            if (max < sum || sum == 0 || max % sum == 0) return false;
            
            // Update max and sum
            max %= sum;
            sum += max;
            maxHeap.add(max);
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization**: Constructing the max-heap and calculating the sum takes O(n log n).
- **Loop Operations**: Each reduction step requires a `poll` from the heap (O(log n)), sum update (O(1)), and `add` to the heap (O(log n)). In the worst case, this loop can run for up to O(n) steps.

Thus, the overall time complexity is:
**O(n log n) for initial setup + O(n log n) for the loop operations â‰ˆ O(n log n)**

This complexity is efficient for large arrays within typical constraints.
