[Leetcode 1388. Pizza With 3n Slices](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1388)
### Problem Statement

The problem "Pizza With 3n Slices" can be summarized as follows:

You have a circular pizza that is divided into `3n` equal slices, and you need to pick exactly `n` slices such that the sum of the chosen slices' values is as large as possible. However, due to the circular nature of the pizza, no two consecutive slices can be chosen.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= n <= 500`
- `slices.length == 3n`
- `0 <= slices[i] <= 1000`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input and Output:**
    - **Input:** A list `slices` of integers of length `3n`.
    - **Output:** An integer representing the maximum sum of `n` non-consecutive slices.

2. **Examples:**
    - Example 1:
        ```java
        Input: slices = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
        Output: 10
        Explanation: Pick slices (2, 3, 5) which gives us 2 + 3 + 5 = 10.
        ```
    - Example 2:
        ```java
        Input: slices = [8,9,8,6,1,1]
        Output: 16
        Explanation: Pick slices (8, 8) which gives us 8 + 8 = 16.
        ```

### Strategy

This problem can be approached using dynamic programming. Given the circular nature of the problem, we'll consider two scenarios to handle the circular constraint:

1. Consider taking slices from index `0` to `3n-2` (excluding the last slice).
2. Consider taking slices from index `1` to `3n-1` (excluding the first slice).

For each scenario, we can use a dynamic programming approach similar to the "House Robber II" problem:

- We'll have a DP array `dp[i][j]` where `i` represents the index of the slice being considered, and `j` represents the number of slices taken so far, up to `n`.

### Code

Here is a Java solution implementing the described strategy:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxSizeSlices(int[] slices) {
        int n = slices.length / 3;
        return Math.max(maxSizeSlicesHelper(slices, 0, slices.length - 2, n),
                        maxSizeSlicesHelper(slices, 1, slices.length - 1, n));
    }

    private int maxSizeSlicesHelper(int[] slices, int start, int end, int n) {
        int length = end - start + 1;
        int[][] dp = new int[length + 1][n + 1];

        for (int i = 1; i <= length; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], (i > 1 ? dp[i - 2][j - 1] : 0) + slices[start + i - 1]);
            }
        }

        return dp[length][n];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] slices1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
        System.out.println(sol.maxSizeSlices(slices1)); // Output: 10

        int[] slices2 = {8, 9, 8, 6, 1, 1};
        System.out.println(sol.maxSizeSlices(slices2)); // Output: 16
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(3n^2)\)
  - Each of the two calls to `maxSizeSlicesHelper` takes \(O(n \times n)\) time where `n` is the number of slices to pick.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(3n^2)\)
  - The space required for the DP table is proportional to \(3n^2\) for each call due to the \(dp[i][j]\) array.

This approach ensures we explore all optimal ways to pick `n` non-consecutive slices while handling the circular constraint effectively.
