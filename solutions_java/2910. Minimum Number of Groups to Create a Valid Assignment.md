[Leetcode 2910. Minimum Number of Groups to Create a Valid Assignment](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2910)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `tasks` where `tasks[i]` represents the number of hours needed to complete the ith task. Each task can only be assigned to one person. However, a person can only be assigned tasks such that the total hours do not exceed 8. Find the minimum number of groups (individual people) required to assign all the tasks.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Task Constraints**: What is the range of hours for each task in the `tasks` array?
   - Assumed that each task requires between 1 to 8 hours.
   
2. **Array Size**: Will the size of the `tasks` array be given?
   - Assumed that the array size is between 1 to `10^5`.

3. **Task Ordering**: Is the order of tasks in the list critical?
   - The order of tasks in the list does not matter for grouping.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently:

1. **Sort Tasks**: Sort the `tasks` array to make the grouping easier. This allows for a simple way to place the largest possible tasks with smaller ones within the 8-hour limit.

2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: Use a two-pointer technique to form the groups:
   - Start with one pointer (`i`) at the beginning (smallest task) and another pointer (`j`) at the end (largest task) of the sorted array.
   - Attempt to pair the task pointed by `j` (largest remaining task) with the task pointed by `i` (smallest remaining task) if their combined time is within the 8-hour limit.
   - If they can be paired, move both pointers inward, indicating both tasks have been assigned.
   - If they cannot be paired, move only the `j` pointer inward, assigning the task at `j` to a new group.

3. **Count Groups**: Every time you move the `j` pointer inward, it means a new group (individual person) is required.

### Code

Here's the Java code to implement the above strategy:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MinimumGroups {

    public static int minNumberOfGroups(int[] tasks) {
        Arrays.sort(tasks);
        int i = 0, j = tasks.length - 1;
        int groups = 0;
        
        while (i <= j) {
            if (tasks[i] + tasks[j] <= 8) {
                i++; // If they can be paired, proceed the left pointer
            }
            j--; // Always move the right pointer
            groups++; // Each iteration means one group
        }
        
        return groups;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] tasks = {8, 2, 3, 5, 6, 8};
        System.out.println(minNumberOfGroups(tasks)); // Output will depend on the combination
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: Sorting the `tasks` array takes `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of tasks.
- **Two-Pointer Approach**: This approach scans the array once from both ends, taking `O(n)` time.

Combining both steps, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`. This should be efficient enough for the given problem constraints.
