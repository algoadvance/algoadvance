[Leetcode 2187. Minimum Time to Complete Trips](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2187)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `time` where `time[i]` is the time taken by the `i-th` bus to complete one trip. Each bus can make multiple trips successively; that is, the next trip can start as soon as the current trip is completed. 

Given an integer `totalTrips`, return the minimum time required for all buses to complete at least `totalTrips` trips.

**Example:**
```
Input: time = [1, 2, 3], totalTrips = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: 
- At time t = 1, the first bus completes 1 trip.
- At time t = 2, the first bus completes 2 trips and the second bus completes 1 trip.
- At time t = 3, the first bus completes 3 trips, the second bus completes 2 trips, and the third bus completes 1 trip.
- There have been 'totalTrips' = 5 trips at time t = 3.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of the values in the array `time`?
   - What is the range of the integer `totalTrips`?
   
2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Do we need to consider the earliest time at which exactly `totalTrips` are completed, or can it be more than `totalTrips`?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - What happens if `time` is an empty array?
   - What if `totalTrips` is zero?

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we'll use a binary search approach to minimize the maximum time required to complete the trips:

1. **Define the Search Space:** 
   - The minimum possible time is 1 (if totalTrips is greater than 0).
   - The maximum possible time is the worst case where the slowest bus completes all trips: `max(time) * totalTrips`.

2. **Binary Search Implementation:**
   - Calculate the midpoint of the current search interval.
   - Determine whether this midpoint can be the minimum required time by checking if the total number of trips completed by all buses in this time is at least `totalTrips`.
   - If it can, reduce the search space by making the current midpoint the upper bound.
   - Otherwise, increase the lower bound to `mid + 1`.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach can be defined as:
- **Binary Search Part:** O(log(max(time) * totalTrips)).
- **Checking Trips in Given Time:** O(n), where n is the number of buses.

Overall, the complexity is O(n * log(max(time) * totalTrips)).

### Code

Here is the Java implementation:

```java
public class BusScheduler {
    
    public long minimumTime(int[] time, int totalTrips) {
        // Edge case checks
        if (time == null || time.length == 0 || totalTrips <= 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        long left = 1;
        long right = (long) time[0] * totalTrips; // Initial upper bound
        for (int t : time) {
            right = Math.max(right, (long) t * totalTrips);
        }

        while (left < right) {
            long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (canCompleteTrips(time, totalTrips, mid)) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return left;
    }

    private boolean canCompleteTrips(int[] time, int totalTrips, long mid) {
        long trips = 0;
        for (int t : time) {
            trips += mid / t;
        }
        return trips >= totalTrips;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BusScheduler busScheduler = new BusScheduler();
        int[] time = {1, 2, 3};
        int totalTrips = 5;
        System.out.println(busScheduler.minimumTime(time, totalTrips)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Edge Case Handling:** The function checks for potentially invalid or edge case inputs.
2. **Binary Search Setup:** The search space is defined with `left` starting at 1 and `right` set to the maximum possible scenario.
3. **Binary Search Execution:** The loop continues adjusting the search interval until the correct minimum time is found.
4. **Trips Calculation:** The helper function `canCompleteTrips()` calculates all possible trips that can be completed in a given `mid` time to determine the feasibility.
