[Leetcode 909. Snakes and Ladders](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l909)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `board` where the cells are labeled from `1` to `n^2` in a Boustrophedon (or snake-like) way starting from `board[n - 1][0]` and ending at `board[0][n - 1]`. The board also contains ladders and snakes as follows:

- If `board[i][j] != -1`, it means there is a ladder or a snake from cell `i*n + j + 1` to `board[i][j]`.
- If `board[i][j] == -1`, it means there is no snake or ladder at cell `i*n + j + 1`.

You start from cell `1` and want to reach the cell `n^2` in the least number of moves. Each move, you can roll a die with numbers 1 to 6, and move the appropriate number of steps forward (i.e., move from cell `x` to `x + roll`). If you reach a cell with a ladder or snake, you must move to the destination of that ladder or snake.

Return the least number of moves required to reach the square `n^2`. If it is not possible to reach the square, return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What are the constraints on the size of `n`?
   - The size `n` can range from `1` to `20`.

2. **Nature of Inputs**: Can the board contain invalid positions for ladders/snakes (negative values beyond -1)?
   - No, the board contains only `-1` or valid cell numbers for ladders and snakes.

3. **Behavior of Dice Rolls**: Is a single roll considered one move regardless of the die's result?
   - Yes, each die roll is considered as one move regardless of the number on the die.

4. **Starting Point Confirmation**: Do we always start from cell `1`?
   - Yes, the starting point is always cell `1`.

5. **Destination Confirmation**: Do we always need to reach cell `n^2` or return -1 if unreachable?
   - Yes, the goal is always to reach cell `n^2`.


## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm since BFS is optimal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.

### Steps:
1. Initialize a queue for BFS and a boolean array to track visited cells.
2. Start from cell `1`, marking it as visited and enqueue it with `0` moves.
3. For each cell, simulate the dice rolls (`1` to `6`) to compute the next cells.
4. Adjust the resulting cell based on the ladders or snakes.
5. If the resulting cell is the destination (`n^2`), return the number of moves.
6. If not, mark it as visited and enqueue it.
7. If the BFS completes without finding the destination, return `-1`.

### Code

Below is the Java implementation of the above strategy:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int snakesAndLadders(int[][] board) {
        int n = board.length;
        int target = n * n;
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[target + 1];
        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        
        queue.offer(new int[]{1, 0}); // {current cell, move count}
        visited[1] = true;
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] cur = queue.poll();
            int cell = cur[0];
            int moves = cur[1];
            
            for (int i = 1; i <= 6; i++) {
                int next = cell + i;
                if (next > target) continue;
                
                int[] pos = getBoardPosition(next, n);
                int row = pos[0], col = pos[1];
                
                if (board[row][col] != -1) {
                    next = board[row][col];
                }
                
                if (next == target) {
                    return moves + 1;
                }
                
                if (!visited[next]) {
                    visited[next] = true;
                    queue.offer(new int[]{next, moves + 1});
                }
            }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
    
    // Helper function to convert cell number to board's (row, col)
    private int[] getBoardPosition(int num, int n) {
        int r = (num - 1) / n;
        int c = (num - 1) % n;
        if (r % 2 == 1) c = n - 1 - c;
        return new int[]{n - 1 - r, c};
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is `O(n^2)` because each cell is processed at most once, and there are at most `n^2` cells on the board.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is also `O(n^2)` due to the queue and visited array.
