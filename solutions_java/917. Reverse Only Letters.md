[Leetcode 917. Reverse Only Letters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l917)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` which consists of lowercase and uppercase letters. Reverse only the letters and leave all other characters at their original positions.

**Example 1:**
- **Input:** s = "ab-cd"
- **Output:** "dc-ba"

**Example 2:**
- **Input:** s = "a-bC-dEf-ghIj"
- **Output:** "j-Ih-gfE-dCba"

**Example 3:**
- **Input:** s = "Test1ng-Leet=code-Q!"
- **Output:** "Qedo1ct-eeLg=ntse-T!"

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s` consists of characters with ASCII values in the range `[33, 122]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Does the input string include symbols, digits, and spaces? 
   - **Answer:** The problem statement implies that `s` consists of various characters, not limited to letters.
   
2. Should the case sensitivity of letters be maintained?
   - **Answer:** Yes, maintain the case sensitivity (lowercase should remain lowercase and uppercase should remain uppercase).

3. Are there any special performance requirements?
   - **Answer:** None specified, but an efficient solution is always desirable.

### Strategy

1. **Two-pointer Approach:** Use two pointers, one starting from the beginning and the other from the end. Move both pointers towards the center of the string.
2. **Swap Letters:** When both pointers point to a letter, swap the letters.
3. **Skip Non-Letters:** If a pointer points to a non-letter, move that pointer inward without making a swap.
4. **Stop Condition:** Continue the process until the two pointers cross each other.

### Code

```java
public class ReverseOnlyLetters {
    public String reverseOnlyLetters(String s) {
        char[] arr = s.toCharArray();
        int left = 0;
        int right = arr.length - 1;
        
        while (left < right) {
            if (!Character.isLetter(arr[left])) {
                left++;
            } else if (!Character.isLetter(arr[right])) {
                right--;
            } else {
                char temp = arr[left];
                arr[left] = arr[right];
                arr[right] = temp;
                left++;
                right--;
            }
        }
        
        return new String(arr);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ReverseOnlyLetters solution = new ReverseOnlyLetters();
        System.out.println(solution.reverseOnlyLetters("ab-cd")); // "dc-ba"
        System.out.println(solution.reverseOnlyLetters("a-bC-dEf-ghIj")); // "j-Ih-gfE-dCba"
        System.out.println(solution.reverseOnlyLetters("Test1ng-Leet=code-Q!")); // "Qedo1ct-eeLg=ntse-T!"
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string. The two-pointer technique ensures that each character is processed at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), if considering the space required to store the character array. However, if the reversal is done in-place, the additional space used is constant, O(1).

This approach is efficient and fulfills the problem's requirements effectively.
