[Leetcode 2275. Largest Combination With Bitwise AND Greater Than Zero full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2275)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of positive integers `candidates`. Evaluate the largest combination where the bitwise AND of all the integers in this combination is greater than zero. The size of the list can be up to `10^5` and each integer can be as large as `10^9`. Return the size of the largest such combination.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the elements be repeated in the list of candidates?
   **A:** Yes, the elements can be repeated.
   
2. **Q:** Can a combination consist of only one integer?
   **A:** Yes, a single integer counts as a combination with a valid bitwise AND if it is greater than zero.
   
3. **Q:** Are there any constraints on time or space complexity?
   **A:** The solution should be efficient enough to handle up to `10^5` elements and each element as large as `10^9`, ideally in linear or near-linear time complexity.

### Strategy

To find the largest combination where the bitwise AND of all elements is greater than zero, we need to determine how many numbers have each specific bit set. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step approach:

1. **Bit Counting:** For each bit position (from 0 to 29 since `10^9` fits within 30 bits), count how many numbers have that bit set.
2. **Max Counting:** The combination that contains the largest number of elements with a common bit set is our answer since the AND of those bits will be greater than zero.

### Code

Here is the Java code to solve the problem:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int largestCombination(int[] candidates) {
        int maxCount = 0;
        
        // Iterate over each of the first 30 bits (since 10^9 < 2^30)
        for (int i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
            int count = 0;

            // Count how many numbers have the i-th bit set
            for (int num : candidates) {
                if ((num & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                    count++;
                }
            }

            // Update the maximum count of any bit position
            maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, count);
        }
        
        return maxCount;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] candidates = {16, 17, 71, 62, 12, 24, 14};
        System.out.println(solution.largestCombination(candidates)); // Output will be 4
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(30 * N) = O(N), where `N` is the number of integers in the candidates list. The constant factor 30 represents the fixed number of bit positions we need to check.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we are only using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This solution is efficient for handling large inputs due to its linear time complexity.
