[Leetcode 2029. Stone Game IX](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2029)
## Problem Statement

Alice and Bob continue their games with stones. There is a row of stones, and each stone has an associated value. The game rules are as follows:
- Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.
- On each turn, the player picks and removes a stone from the row of stones.
- The goal is to make the sum of the removed stones' values leave a remainder of 3 when divided by 3.
- If a player cannot make a move that satisfies this condition, they lose the game.

Given an array of integers that represent the stones' values, determine if Alice can win the game assuming both players play optimally.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What are the constraints on the length of the array and the values of the stones?
2. What should be returned exactly? A boolean indicating if Alice can win?
3. Is the array always non-empty?
4. Can the stones' values be negative?
5. Does the sum being divisible by 3 play a role in the game or is this just a regular modulo operation?

## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean stoneGameIX(int[] stones) {
        // Counts of stones modulo 3
        int[] moduloCounts = new int[3];
        for (int stone : stones) {
            moduloCounts[stone % 3]++;
        }

        // If there are no stones with remainder 0, and either of the other counts are zero
        if (moduloCounts[0] % 2 == 0) {
            return moduloCounts[1] >= 1 && moduloCounts[2] >= 1;
        }
        
        return Math.abs(moduloCounts[1] - moduloCounts[2]) > 2;
    }
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Modulo Counts**: First, count how many stones have values which result in remainders 0, 1, and 2 when divided by 3.
2. **Zero Remainders Handling**: If the count of stones with remainder 0 is even, then Alice wins if and only if both counts of stones with remainder 1 and 2 are non-zero.
3. **Uneven Zero Remainders**: If the count of stones with remainder 0 is odd, Alice wins if the difference between the counts of stones with remainder 1 and 2 is more than 2.
   
The modulo counts give a clear view of playable stones in terms of their impact on the sum of stone values. Using even/odd properties for zero remainder stones helps determine the overall strategy.

## Time Complexity

- **Counting Modulo**: O(n) where n is the length of the stones array.
- **Decision Making**: O(1) as it only involves a few boolean checks and arithmetic operations.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n).
