[Leetcode 110. Balanced Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l110)
### Problem Statement
Leetcode Problem 110: Balanced Binary Tree

Given a binary tree, determine if it is height-balanced.

A height-balanced binary tree is defined as:
1. A binary tree in which the left and right subtrees of every node differ in height by no more than 1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input:** What is the type of input for the tree (e.g., array, TreeNode)?
   - **Answer:** The input will be a TreeNode, which is the root of the binary tree.
2. **Edge Cases:** How should specific edge cases be handled, such as an empty tree?
   - **Answer:** An empty tree (where the root is null) is considered balanced.

### Strategy
To determine whether a binary tree is height-balanced:
1. We need to calculate the height of the left and right subtree of every node.
2. We then check the difference in heights. If the difference is greater than 1 for any node, the tree is not balanced.
3. We can achieve this efficiently by using a recursive approach:
   - Compute the height of the left and right subtrees.
   - If at any point the subtrees differ in height by more than 1, we can immediately return false.
   - Otherwise, we return true if all nodes are balanced.

We will modify the height computation to also return a special value (e.g., -1) if it finds an unbalanced subtree. This helps us avoid redundant computations.

### Code
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
public class Solution {
    public boolean isBalanced(TreeNode root) {
        return checkHeight(root) != -1;
    }
    
    private int checkHeight(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int leftHeight = checkHeight(node.left);
        if (leftHeight == -1) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        int rightHeight = checkHeight(node.right);
        if (rightHeight == -1) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        if (Math.abs(leftHeight - rightHeight) > 1) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        return Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because in the worst case, we visit each node once and perform a constant amount of work at each node. 

The space complexity is O(h) due to the recursion stack, where h is the height of the tree.
