[Leetcode 2651. Calculate Delayed Arrival Time](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2651)
### Problem Statement
Given the `arrivalTime` of a train and a `delayedTime` in hours, determine the actual arrival time. The arrival time is given in a 24-hour format (0-23). The actual arrival time should also be returned in this format. If the actual arrival time goes beyond 23, it should wrap around to the start of the day (i.e., 24 should be converted to 0, 25 to 1, and so on).

**Example:**
- Input: `arrivalTime = 15`, `delayedTime = 5`
- Output: `20`

**Example:**
- Input: `arrivalTime = 23`, `delayedTime = 1`
- Output: `0`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Values**: Can we assume the input values will always be valid integers within the expected ranges (`0 <= arrivalTime <= 23`, `delayedTime >= 0`)?
2. **Output**: Should the output be printed or returned?
3. **Edge Cases**: What should be the behavior for minimal and maximal values of `arrivalTime` and `delayedTime`?

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int findDelayedArrivalTime(int arrivalTime, int delayedTime) {
        return (arrivalTime + delayedTime) % 24;
    }
}
```

### Strategy
1. **Input Handling**: Ensure we receive two integer inputs: `arrivalTime` and `delayedTime`.
2. **Calculate Delayed Time**: Add `arrivalTime` and `delayedTime`.
3. **Modulo Operation**: Use the modulo operator `%` with 24 to ensure the resultant time stays within the 24-hour format.
   - This operation effectively wraps the time around if it exceeds 23 (`24 % 24` results in `0`, `25 % 24` results in `1`, etc.).
4. **Return Result**: Return the calculated time as the actual arrival time.

### Time Complexity
- **Constant Time**: The operations performed (addition and modulo) are O(1). Therefore, the time complexity is O(1).
