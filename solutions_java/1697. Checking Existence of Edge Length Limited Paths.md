[Leetcode 1697. Checking Existence of Edge Length Limited Paths](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1697)
## Problem Statement:

You are given an undirected weighted graph of `n` nodes (0-indexed), represented by an edge list where `edges[i] = [u, v, w]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `u` and `v` with weight `w`.

You are also given a list `queries`, where `queries[j] = [p, q, limit]`.

The answer to the `j`-th query is `true` if there is a path from `p` to `q` such that each edge on the path has a weight less than `limit[j]`.

Return a boolean array `answer` where `answer.length == queries.length` and `answer[j]` is the answer to the `j`-th query.

**Example:**
```text
Input: n = 3, edges = [[0,1,2],[1,2,4],[2,0,8]], queries = [[0,2,5],[0,2,3]]
Output: [true, false]
```

**Constraints:**
- `2 <= n <= 10^5`
- `1 <= edges.length, queries.length <= 10^5`
- `edges[i].length == 3`
- `queries[j].length == 3`
- `0 <= u, v, p, q <= n-1`
- `u != v`
- `p != q`
- `1 <= w, limit <= 10^9`
- There are no duplicate edges.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Can edges have the same start and end nodes?**
   No, an edge must connect two different nodes, and `u != v`.

2. **Are there any repeated queries, and how should we handle them?**
   There can be repeated queries. Each query should be processed independently.

3. **Do we always have a connected graph?**
   No, the graph isn't necessarily connected.

4. **Is the graph directed or undirected?**
   The graph is undirected, meaning each edge `[u, v, w]` can be traversed both ways.

## Strategy:

To solve the problem efficiently within the constraints, we can leverage the Union-Find data structure (Disjoint Set Union, DSU).

### Steps:

1. **Sort the Queries and Edges:**
   - First, sort all queries by their limits.
   - Sort the edges by their weights.

2. **Process Sorted Queries with Union-Find:**
   - Initialize the Union-Find structure to manage connected components.
   - Iterate through the sorted queries, and for each query:
     - While current edge weight is less than the query limit, apply Union-Find to unify the connected components by edges.
     - Check if nodes `p` and `q` from the current query are in the same component using Union-Find.

3. **Union-Find Operations:**
   - Union operation to connect two components.
   - Find operation to determine the component of a node.

### Code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public boolean[] distanceLimitedPathsExist(int n, int[][] edges, int[][] queries) {
        // Sort the queries by limit and remember their original indexes
        int[][] sortedQueries = new int[queries.length][4];
        for (int i = 0; i < queries.length; i++) {
            sortedQueries[i][0] = queries[i][0];
            sortedQueries[i][1] = queries[i][1];
            sortedQueries[i][2] = queries[i][2];
            sortedQueries[i][3] = i;
        }
        Arrays.sort(sortedQueries, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[2], b[2]));

        // Sort edges by their weights
        Arrays.sort(edges, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[2], b[2]));

        UnionFind uf = new UnionFind(n);
        boolean[] answer = new boolean[queries.length];
        int edgeIndex = 0;
        
        // Process each query
        for (int[] query : sortedQueries) {
            int p = query[0];
            int q = query[1];
            int limit = query[2];
            int quIndex = query[3];

            // Add all edges with weight less than the current query limit
            while (edgeIndex < edges.length && edges[edgeIndex][2] < limit) {
                uf.union(edges[edgeIndex][0], edges[edgeIndex][1]);
                edgeIndex++;
            }

            // Check if p and q are connected
            answer[quIndex] = uf.connected(p, q);
        }
        
        return answer;
    }
}

class UnionFind {
    private int[] parent;
    private int[] rank;

    public UnionFind(int n) {
        parent = new int[n];
        rank = new int[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            parent[i] = i;
            rank[i] = 1;
        }
    }

    public int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x) {
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        }
        return parent[x];
    }

    public void union(int x, int y) {
        int rootX = find(x);
        int rootY = find(y);
        if (rootX != rootY) {
            if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]) {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
            } else if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]) {
                parent[rootX] = rootY;
            } else {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
                rank[rootX]++;
            }
        }
    }

    public boolean connected(int x, int y) {
        return find(x) == find(y);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- Sorting edges: `O(m log m)`
- Sorting queries: `O(k log k)`
- Union-Find operations: almost `O(α(n))` per operation in practice, where `α` is the inverse Ackermann function, very close to `O(1)`

Thus, the overall time complexity is approximately `O((m + k) log(m + k))` where `m` is the number of edges and `k` is the number of queries.

### Space Complexity:

- Union-Find structure: `O(n)`
- Extra Arrays for sorting: `O(m)` for edges, `O(k)` for queries

Thus, the space complexity is `O(max(n, m, k))`.
