[Leetcode 2115. Find All Possible Recipes from Given Supplies](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2115)
## Problem Statement

You have a list of recipes, and each recipe is made from a list of ingredients. Some of the ingredients are supplied, and you can use them directly. Your task is to find all the recipes that can be created with the current supplies without requiring any additional ingredients.

More formally, you have the following inputs:
- `recipes`: a list of strings, where each string represents the name of a recipe.
- `ingredients`: a list of lists, where the i-th list contains the ingredients necessary to create the i-th recipe.
- `supplies`: a list of strings representing the ingredients you currently have.

You need to return a list of all possible recipes you can create with the current supplies.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: 
recipes = ["bread", "sandwich"]
ingredients = [["yeast", "flour"], ["bread", "ham"]]
supplies = ["yeast", "flour", "ham"]
Output: ["bread", "sandwich"]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can there be cycles in the ingredient dependencies?**
   - Assume there are no cycles in the graph of dependencies.
2. **What should be returned if no recipes can be created?**
   - Return an empty list.
3. **Can a recipe be used as an ingredient for another recipe?**
   - Yes, once a recipe is made, it can be used as an ingredient for another recipe.

## Strategy

The problem can be viewed as a graph traversal where:
- Nodes represent recipes and ingredients.
- Edges represent the requirement of ingredients to create a recipe.

We can model this problem using topological sorting (Kahn's Algorithm), as it helps in determining the order of creation of recipes based on the availability of ingredients.

### Steps:
1. **Create Graph Representation:**
   - Construct a graph where nodes are ingredients/recipes, and edges represent the usage of ingredients in recipes.
   - Also, maintain an "in-degree" count for each recipe.

2. **Initialize Sources:**
   - Add all initial supplies to a queue (these represent nodes with zero in-degrees).

3. **BFS Traversal:**
   - Process each node, reduce in-degree of dependent nodes, and add to queue if their in-degree becomes zero.
   - Add recipes to the resultant list once all their ingredients are available.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<String> findAllRecipes(String[] recipes, List<List<String>> ingredients, String[] supplies) {
        // Graph to keep track of dependencies
        Map<String, List<String>> graph = new HashMap<>();
        // Map to track the in-degree of each recipe (number of required ingredients)
        Map<String, Integer> inDegree = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Initialize graph and inDegree
        for (String recipe : recipes) {
            graph.put(recipe, new ArrayList<>());
            inDegree.put(recipe, 0);
        }
        
        // Build the graph and in-degree map
        for (int i = 0; i < recipes.length; i++) {
            String recipe = recipes[i];
            for (String ingredient : ingredients.get(i)) {
                if (!graph.containsKey(ingredient)) {
                    graph.put(ingredient, new ArrayList<>());
                }
                graph.get(ingredient).add(recipe);
                inDegree.put(recipe, inDegree.get(recipe) + 1);
            }
        }
        
        // Queue for processing the nodes
        Queue<String> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        
        // Initialize the queue with initial supplies
        for (String supply : supplies) {
            if (!graph.containsKey(supply)) {
                graph.put(supply, new ArrayList<>());
            }
            queue.offer(supply);
        }
        
        // List to store the result
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Process the queue
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            String current = queue.poll();
            for (String next : graph.get(current)) {
                inDegree.put(next, inDegree.get(next) - 1);
                if (inDegree.get(next) == 0) {
                    queue.offer(next);
                    if (Arrays.asList(recipes).contains(next)) {
                        result.add(next);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Building Graph and In-degree Map:** `O(R + E)` where `R` is the number of recipes, and `E` is the total number of ingredient-recipe edges.
- **Processing the Queue:** Each node and edge is processed once, `O(R + E)`.
- Overall, the time complexity is `O(R + E)`, which is efficient for the given problem constraints.
