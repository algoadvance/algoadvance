[Leetcode 2523. Closest Prime Numbers in Range](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2523)
### Problem Statement

Given two integers `left` and `right`, find the two prime numbers such that the absolute difference between them is the minimum over the range `[left, right]`, inclusive. If there are multiple pairs, return the pair with the smallest values.

Return the pair as an array of two integers, or `[-1, -1]` if there are no such pair of prime numbers.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: left = 10, right = 19
Output: [11, 13]
Explanation: The prime numbers between 10 and 19 are [11, 13, 17, 19]. The minimum difference is between 11 and 13.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range Validity:** Can `left` be greater than `right`?   
   - No, the question guarantees that `left` is less than or equal to `right`.

2. **Constraints on Values:**
   - Are there any constraints on the values of `left` and `right`?
     - The values given can be reasonably assumed to lie within a range compatible with common computing limits for such problems, for example, `left` and `right` might be within the order of `10^6`.

3. **Outputs:**
   - What should the function return if there are fewer than two prime numbers in the range?
     - It should return `[-1, -1]`.

### Strategy

1. **Sieve of Eratosthenes:** 
   - Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all prime numbers up to `right`.
   
2. **Prime Filtering:**
   - Filter these prime numbers to only include those within the range `[left, right]`.

3. **Finding Closest Primes:**
   - Iterate through the filtered primes to find the closest pair.

### Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class ClosestPrimeNumbersInRange {
    public int[] closestPrimes(int left, int right) {
        // Step 1: Create a boolean array for prime number sieve
        boolean[] isPrime = sieveOfEratosthenes(right);
        
        // Step 2: Collect primes within the given range [left, right]
        ArrayList<Integer> primesInRange = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = Math.max(2, left); i <= right; i++) {
            if (isPrime[i]) {
                primesInRange.add(i);
            }
        }
        
        if (primesInRange.size() < 2) {
            return new int[] {-1, -1};  // Less than two primes in the range.
        }
        
        // Step 3: Find the pair of primes with the minimum difference
        int minDiff = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int[] result = new int[2];
        for (int i = 1; i < primesInRange.size(); i++) {
            int diff = primesInRange.get(i) - primesInRange.get(i-1);
            if (diff < minDiff) {
                minDiff = diff;
                result[0] = primesInRange.get(i-1);
                result[1] = primesInRange.get(i);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    private boolean[] sieveOfEratosthenes(int n) {
        // Step 1: Create an array to track prime numbers
        boolean[] isPrime = new boolean[n + 1];
        Arrays.fill(isPrime, true);
        isPrime[0] = isPrime[1] = false; // 0 and 1 are not primes

        // Step 2: Apply sieve algorithm
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= n; i++) {
            if (isPrime[i]) {
                for (int j = i * i; j <= n; j += i) {
                    isPrime[j] = false;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return isPrime;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ClosestPrimeNumbersInRange solution = new ClosestPrimeNumbersInRange();
        int left = 10;
        int right = 19;
        int[] result = solution.closestPrimes(left, right);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(result));
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sieve of Eratosthenes:** \(O(n \log \log n)\) where \( n \) is the value of `right`.
- **Filtering Primes:** \(O(n)\) where \( n \) is the number of primes found.
- **Finding the Closest Pair:** \(O(m)\) where \( m \) is the number of prime numbers in the given range.
  
Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the sieve stage, which is \(O(n \log \log n)\).
