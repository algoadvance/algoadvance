[Leetcode 2256. Minimum Average Difference](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2256)
### Problem Statement:
You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n`.

The **average difference** of the `i-th` index is the **absolute difference** between the average of the first `i + 1` elements of the array and the average of the last `n - i - 1` elements. Both averages should be rounded down to the nearest integer.

Return the index with the minimum average difference. If there are multiple indices with the same minimum average difference, return the smallest one.

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,4,3,1,2]
Output: 2
Explanation:
- The average of the first 3 elements (2, 4, 3): (2 + 4 + 3) // 3 = 3
- The average of the last 2 elements (1, 2): (1 + 2) // 2 = 1
- The absolute difference between the two averages = |3 - 1| = 2
- No other index provides a smaller absolute difference.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [2,1,3,3]
Output: 0
Explanation:
- For index 0, the first part is [2] and the second part is [1,3,3]
- The absolute difference = |2 - 2| = 0
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Q:** Can the input array be empty?
   **A:** No, the input array will always have at least one element.
2. **Q:** Can elements of the array be negative?
   **A:** Yes, elements of the array can be negative.
3. **Q:** What should be the return value if there are multiple indices with the same minimum average difference?
   **A:** Return the smallest index among them.

### Strategy:
1. **Initialization**: 
   - Calculate the total sum of the array `total_sum`.
   - Initialize variables to keep track of the left sum (`left_sum`) and right sum (`right_sum`).
  
2. **Iteration**:
   - Iterate over the array while maintaining running sums for left part and right part dynamically.
   - For each index `i`, calculate:
     - left sum as the sum of elements from `0` to `i`.
     - left average by dividing left sum by `i+1`.
     - right sum as the total sum minus the left sum.
     - right average by dividing right sum by `(n-i-1)`, making sure to handle division by zero correctly (considering after the last element there are no right elements).
     
3. **Track Minimum**:
   - Calculate the absolute difference between the left average and right average for each index.
   - Track the minimum difference and its corresponding index.

4. **Return** the index with the minimum average difference.

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: Single pass through the array to calculate the left and right sums dynamically, making it efficient and linear in the size of the input array.

### Code:
```java
public class MinimumAverageDifference {
    public int minimumAverageDifference(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        long totalSum = 0;
        long leftSum = 0;
        
        // Calculate the total sum of the array
        for (int num : nums) {
            totalSum += num;
        }
        
        // Initialize variables to track the minimum average difference and its index
        int minIndex = 0;
        long minDiff = Long.MAX_VALUE;
        
        // Iterate over the array to find the minimum average difference
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            leftSum += nums[i];
            long leftAvg = leftSum / (i + 1);
            
            long rightSum = totalSum - leftSum;
            long rightAvg = (n - i - 1 == 0) ? 0 : rightSum / (n - i - 1);
            
            long diff = Math.abs(leftAvg - rightAvg);
            
            if (diff < minDiff) {
                minDiff = diff;
                minIndex = i;
            }
        }
        
        return minIndex;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumAverageDifference solver = new MinimumAverageDifference();
        int[] nums1 = {2, 4, 3, 1, 2};
        int[] nums2 = {2, 1, 3, 3};
        System.out.println(solver.minimumAverageDifference(nums1)); // Output: 2
        System.out.println(solver.minimumAverageDifference(nums2)); // Output: 0
    }
}
```
