[Leetcode 732. My Calendar III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l732)
## Problem Statement:

Implement a `MyCalendarThree` class to store your events. A new event can always be added. Your implementation should support the following two methods:

- `MyCalendarThree()` Initializes the object.
- `int book(int start, int end)` Returns an integer `k` representing the largest number of non-overlapping intervals that occur simultaneously.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Range of `start` and `end` values:** What are the possible ranges for the integers `start` and `end`?
2. **Interval inclusivity:** Are the intervals [start, end) inclusive of `start` and exclusive of `end`?
3. **Order of calls:** Can we assume that the `book` method will be called in a sequence or order that makes it easier to manage the intervals?

## Code:

```java
import java.util.Map;
import java.util.TreeMap;

class MyCalendarThree {
    private TreeMap<Integer, Integer> timeline;

    public MyCalendarThree() {
        timeline = new TreeMap<>();
    }

    public int book(int start, int end) {
        timeline.put(start, timeline.getOrDefault(start, 0) + 1);
        timeline.put(end, timeline.getOrDefault(end, 0) - 1);

        int ongoing = 0, maxConcurrent = 0;
        for (int count : timeline.values()) {
            ongoing += count;
            maxConcurrent = Math.max(maxConcurrent, ongoing);
        }
        return maxConcurrent;
    }
}
```

## Strategy:

1. **TreeMap for Interval Management:**
   - Use a `TreeMap` to keep track of all events in a sorted manner. This helps in efficiently managing event start and end times.

2. **Recording Events:**
   - For each `start`, increment the count of ongoing events.
   - For each `end`, decrement the count of ongoing events.

3. **Calculate Maximum Overlapping Intervals:**
   - Traverse the values in the `TreeMap` to maintain a running sum of ongoing events.
   - Track the maximum value encountered during this traversal to determine the maximum number of overlapping intervals at any point in time.

## Time Complexity:

- **Insertion (`book` method):** The insertion into the `TreeMap` costs `O(log N)` where `N` is the number of unique times recorded (start and end times combined).
- **Traversal:** Each call to `book` involves iterating through the `TreeMap`, which in the worst case takes `O(N)` time.
- **Overall Complexity per `book` Call:** The overall complexity for each `book` call is `O(N)` due to the need to potentially traverse all recorded times in the `TreeMap`.

This implementation provides an efficient and clear method for solving the problem of booking and tracking multiple intervals and finding the maximum number of overlapping events.
