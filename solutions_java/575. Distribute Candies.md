[Leetcode 575. Distribute Candies](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l575)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `candyType` representing the types of candies (where each type is represented by a unique integer), you need to determine the maximum number of different types of candies that can be eaten if you can only eat `n / 2` candies (where `n` is the total number of candies).

In other words, you need to distribute the candies in such a way that maximizes the number of unique candy types eaten, provided that you can only eat half of the total candies.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of `candyType` array?
   - Are there any constraints on the values within `candyType`?

2. **Output:**
   - What value should be returned if given input leads to no candies being eaten?

3. **Duplicates:**
   - Can there be multiple candies of the same type?

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashSet;

public class Solution {
    public int distributeCandies(int[] candyType) {
        // Calculate the maximum number of candies that the sister can eat
        int maxCandies = candyType.length / 2;
        
        // Use a HashSet to store the unique types of candies
        HashSet<Integer> uniqueCandies = new HashSet<>();
        
        // Add each candy type to the HashSet
        for (int type : candyType) {
            uniqueCandies.add(type);
        }
        
        // The sister can either eat all unique candy types or maxCandies, whichever is smaller
        return Math.min(uniqueCandies.size(), maxCandies);
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Determine the Max Candies:**
   - Calculate the maximum number of candies that the sister can eat by dividing the array length by 2.

2. **Count Unique Candy Types:**
   - Use a `HashSet` to store all unique candy types.
   - Iterate over the `candyType` array and add each type to the `HashSet`.

3. **Calculate the Result:**
   - Return the minimum between the size of the `HashSet` (unique types) and the previously calculated `maxCandies`.
   - This ensures that you are optimizing for the maximum number of unique candy types eaten within the allowed quantity.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the `candyType` array. This is because we are iterating through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, for storing up to `n` unique candy types in the `HashSet`.

This approach ensures that the solution is both time and space efficient given the constraints of typical interview problems.
