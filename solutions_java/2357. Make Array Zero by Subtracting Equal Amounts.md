[Leetcode 2357. Make Array Zero by Subtracting Equal Amounts full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2357)
## Problem Statement

You are given a non-negative integer array `nums`. In each operation, you must:

1. Choose a positive integer `x` such that `x` is less than or equal to the smallest non-zero element of `nums`.
2. Subtract `x` from every positive element of `nums`.

Return the minimum number of operations required to make every element in `nums` equal to `0`.

### Example:

1. Input: `nums = [1,5,0,3,5]`
   Output: `3`
   
2. Input: `nums = [0]`
   Output: `0`

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the length range of the array `nums`?
   - The length of array `nums` could be anywhere from 0 to 10^5.

2. What values can the elements of `nums` take?
   - Elements of `nums` are non-negative integers and can range from 0 to 10^9.

3. What should be returned if `nums` is already all zeroes?
   - If `nums` is already all zeroes, the number of operations required is 0.

4. Can `nums` contain duplicate numbers?
   - Yes, `nums` can contain duplicate numbers.

## Strategy

To solve the problem, we need to make every element in the array `nums` equal to 0 using the least number of operations described.

One efficient approach is to understand that each unique positive number in the array `nums` must eventually be reduced to zero. Hence, the number of operations required to make the entire array zero is equivalent to the number of unique positive integers in the array.

### Key Steps:

1. Create a set of all unique positive integers from `nums`. 
2. The size of this set will be the number of operations required.

## Code

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class MakeArrayZero {
    public int minimumOperations(int[] nums) {
        Set<Integer> uniquePositives = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num > 0) {
                uniquePositives.add(num);
            }
        }
        
        // The count of unique positive numbers is the number of operations required.
        return uniquePositives.size();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MakeArrayZero maZero = new MakeArrayZero();
        
        int[] nums1 = {1, 5, 0, 3, 5};
        System.out.println(maZero.minimumOperations(nums1)); // Output: 3
        
        int[] nums2 = {0};
        System.out.println(maZero.minimumOperations(nums2)); // Output: 0
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The total time complexity of this approach is O(n) where `n` is the number of elements in the array `nums`. 

- We iterate through the array once to build the set of unique positive integers, which takes O(n) time.
- Checking and adding to the HashSet has an average time complexity of O(1) for each element.

Hence, the overall time complexity is O(n), and this approach is efficient given the constraints of the problem.
