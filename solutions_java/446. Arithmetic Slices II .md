[Leetcode 446. Arithmetic Slices II ](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l446)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of all the **arithmetic subsequences** (of length at least two) that exist in the array. 

A sequence of numbers is called arithmetic if it consists of at least two elements and the difference between every two consecutive elements is the same.

- For example, `[3,6,9,12]`, `[9,7,5,3]`, and `[20,14,8,2]` are arithmetic.

A subsequence is a sequence derived from the array by deleting some or none of the elements while keeping the order of the remaining elements.

**Example 1:**
```plaintext
Input: nums = [2,4,6,8,10]
Output: 7
Explanation: All arithmetic subsequences of length at least 2 are:
[2,4], [4,6], [6,8], [8,10], [2,6,10], [2,4,6], [4,6,8]
```

**Example 2:**
```plaintext
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 16
Explanation: Any subsequence of this array is arithmetic.
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are the input numbers guaranteed to fit within the integer range of Java?
   **A:** Yes, the constraints specify that each number fits within the integer range.

2. **Q:** Should the result include arithmetic subsequences of any length, as long as they're at least two elements long?
   **A:** Yes, the subsequences should be of at least two elements to be considered.

3. **Q:** Are duplicate numbers allowed within the input array?
   **A:** Yes, the example `[7,7,7,7,7]` indicates duplicates are possible and valid.

## Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach with HashMap:** 
    - Use a hashmap of hashmaps (`dp`) where `dp[i]` keeps track of arithmetic subsequences ending at `i` (with their common differences).
    - Each entry `dp[i].get(d)` represents the count of subsequences ending at index `i` with a common difference `d`.
    - For every pair of indices `j` and `i` where `j < i`, compute the difference `d = nums[i] - nums[j]`.
    - Update the count of subsequences: 
        - Add to current `dp[i]` the count of such subsequences from `dp[j]` plus 1 for the subsequence formed by adding `nums[i]`.
        - Increment total count (keeping in mind to exclude the trivial length-2 pairs from the total).

2. **Initialize:** 
    - For each element initialized, `dp[i]` starts with empty hashmaps.

3. **Iterate and Update:**
    - Iterate over all pairs `(i, j)` and update the states.

4. **Count:** 
    - Be careful to count only subsequences of length at least 2, and to avoid double-counting.

## Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public int numberOfArithmeticSlices(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        long totalCount = 0;
        
        HashMap<Integer, Integer>[] dp = new HashMap[n];
        
        // Initialize each hashmap
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = new HashMap<>();
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                long diff = (long)nums[i] - (long)nums[j];
                if (diff <= Integer.MIN_VALUE || diff > Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
                    continue;
                }
                
                int d = (int) diff;
                
                int countAtJ = dp[j].getOrDefault(d, 0);
                int countAtI = dp[i].getOrDefault(d, 0);
                
                totalCount += countAtJ;
                
                dp[i].put(d, countAtI + countAtJ + 1);
            }
        }
        
        return (int)totalCount;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums1 = {2, 4, 6, 8, 10};
        int[] nums2 = {7, 7, 7, 7, 7};
        System.out.println(sol.numberOfArithmeticSlices(nums1));  // Output: 7
        System.out.println(sol.numberOfArithmeticSlices(nums2));  // Output: 16
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n^2)` where `n` is the length of the input array. This is because we're iterating through all pairs of indices `(i, j)` where `i > j`.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n^2)` for storing the hashmaps, although the space requirement may be lower in some cases due to hashmaps only storing unique differences.
