[Leetcode 2532. Time to Cross a Bridge](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2532)
### Problem Statement

There are n workers, each with a distinct ID from 0 to n-1. Each worker passes over a narrow bridge that only allows one worker to cross at a time. The workers are sorted by priority (a given array priorities), and they will cross the bridge in the order of their priority from high to low. For each worker, you are given the time it takes for them to cross the bridge and the time they need to wait before they can start crossing. You want to determine the total time taken for all workers to cross the bridge in the order of their priorities.

Write a function `int timeToCrossBridge(int[] crossingTime, int[] priority)` where `crossingTime` is an array where `crossingTime[i]` represents the time required for worker `i` to cross the bridge, and `priority` is an array where `priority[i]` indicates the priority level of worker `i` (lower values indicate higher priority).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum value for n (number of workers)?**
   - Assume `n` can be up to `10^5`.
  
2. **Can multiple workers have the same priority?**
   - No, each worker has a unique priority.

3. **Is there a minimum wait time before the bridge clears for the next worker?**
   - No, the next worker can start crossing as soon as the previous worker finishes.

4. **What should the output be if there are zero workers?**
   - The total time should be `0`.

### Strategy

1. **Priority Sorting:** Since the workers are given in unordered priority, first we need to sort the workers based on their priority.
2. **Simulating the Crossing:** After sorting by priority, simulate each worker crossing the bridge by keeping a running total of time elapsed.
3. **Output the Total Time:** The total time will be the time when the last worker finishes crossing.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
  
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] crossingTime = {8, 2, 5, 1};
        int[] priority = {2, 0, 3, 1};
        System.out.println(timeToCrossBridge(crossingTime, priority)); // Output should be 16
    }

    public static int timeToCrossBridge(int[] crossingTime, int[] priority) {
        int n = crossingTime.length;
        
        // Pair each worker index with their priority
        int[][] workers = new int[n][2]; // [priority, index]
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            workers[i][0] = priority[i];
            workers[i][1] = i;
        }
        
        // Sort workers by priority (lower value is higher priority)
        Arrays.sort(workers, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));

        int totalTime = 0;

        // Simulate the crossing of the bridge
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int workerIndex = workers[i][1];
            totalTime += crossingTime[workerIndex];
        }
        
        return totalTime;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting Step:** This takes `O(n log n)` because we are using a comparison-based sorting algorithm.
2. **Total Time Calculation:** This takes `O(n)` because we iterate through the sorted list once to calculate the total time.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)**. The space complexity is **O(n)** due to the auxiliary space used for the `workers` array.
