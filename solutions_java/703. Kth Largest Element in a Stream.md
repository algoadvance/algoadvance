[Leetcode 703. Kth Largest Element in a Stream](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l703)
### Problem Statement

Design a class to find the kth largest element in a stream. Note that it is the kth largest element in the sorted order, not the kth distinct element.

Implement the `KthLargest` class:

- `KthLargest(int k, int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the integer k and the stream of integers nums.

- `int add(int val)` Appends the integer val to the stream and returns the element representing the kth largest element in the stream.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the initial array (nums) be empty?**
   - Yes, the initial array can be empty.

2. **What is the range of values for k and the elements in nums?**
   - The value of k will be always valid, i.e., 1 ≤ k ≤ length of input stream (number of elements processed so far).
   - The elements in nums and the values added can range from `-10^4` to `10^4`.

3. **Is it possible to have duplicate numbers in the stream?**
   - Yes, duplicates are allowed.

4. **Do we need to handle any concurrency issues?**
   - No, assume the operations will be used in a single-threaded environment.

### Strategy

To efficiently solve this problem, we will use a minimum heap (priority queue in Java) to keep track of the k largest elements. The smallest element in this heap will be the kth largest element in the stream:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize an empty priority queue (min-heap) with a capacity of k.
   - Insert elements from the initial array into the min-heap, maintaining its size at most k.

2. **Adding new elements:**
   - Add the new element into the min-heap.
   - If adding this element causes the heap size to exceed k, remove the smallest element from the heap.
   - The root of the heap (the smallest element in the heap) now represents the kth largest element of the stream.

### Code

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class KthLargest {

    private final PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap;
    private final int k;

    public KthLargest(int k, int[] nums) {
        this.k = k;
        this.minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(k);
        for (int num : nums) {
            add(num);
        }
    }

    public int add(int val) {
        if (minHeap.size() < k) {
            minHeap.offer(val);
        } else if (val > minHeap.peek()) {
            minHeap.poll();
            minHeap.offer(val);
        }
        return minHeap.peek();
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Initialization:**
   - Building the heap from the initial array takes O(n log k), where n is the length of the initial array `nums`.

2. **Adding a new element:**
   - In the worst case, adding a new element takes O(log k) time due to the heap operations (insert and possibly remove the smallest element).

Thus, each `add` operation is efficient, and we maintain the k-largest elements in O(log k) time per addition.
