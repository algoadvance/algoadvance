[Leetcode 2608. Shortest Cycle in a Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2608)
## Problem Statement:

You are given an undirected graph represented by a 2D integer array edges where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between vertices `ui` and `vi`.

Find the length of the shortest cycle in the graph. A cycle is defined as a non-empty sequence of edges starting and ending at the same vertex, with all vertices distinct in between.

If there is no cycle in the graph, return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. Is the graph guaranteed to be connected?
   - No, the graph may be disconnected.
   
2. What is the range of the number of vertices and edges?
   - The number of vertices and edges is not specified, but it can be assumed to be within reasonable constraints for most graph-related problems (e.g., vertices and edges range from 1 to 10^5).

3. Can the graph contain self-loops or multiple edges between the same pair of vertices?
   - No, according to the problem statement, each `edges[i]` denotes a single undirected edge between distinct vertices ui and vi.

4. Should the solution be optimized for time or space complexity?
   - Ideally, the solution should be balanced in terms of time and space complexity, but time complexity might be more critical for larger inputs.

## Strategy:

1. **Model the graph using an adjacency list**: This will allow efficient exploration of each vertex's neighbors.
2. **Use Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: BFS is well-suited for finding the shortest path properties in an unweighted graph.
3. **Track the shortest cycle**:
   - For each vertex, treat it as the starting point and run a BFS.
   - During the BFS traversal, if we encounter a previously visited vertex (other than the parent in the BFS tree), it indicates a cycle.
   - Keep track of the minimum cycle length found.
4. **Edge case check**: If no cycle is found after exploring all vertices, return `-1`.

## Code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int findShortestCycle(int n, int[][] edges) {
        // Step 1: Create the adjacency list
        Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph = new HashMap<>();
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            graph.computeIfAbsent(edge[0], k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(edge[1]);
            graph.computeIfAbsent(edge[1], k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(edge[0]);
        }

        int shortestCycle = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        // Step 2: Run BFS from each node
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            shortestCycle = Math.min(shortestCycle, bfsCycle(i, graph, n));
        }

        return shortestCycle == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : shortestCycle;
    }

    private int bfsCycle(int start, Map<Integer, List<Integer>> graph, int n) {
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        int[] distance = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(distance, -1);

        queue.add(start);
        distance[start] = 0;

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int current = queue.poll();

            for (int neighbor : graph.getOrDefault(current, new ArrayList<>())) {
                if (distance[neighbor] == -1) { // Not visited
                    queue.add(neighbor);
                    distance[neighbor] = distance[current] + 1;
                } else if (distance[neighbor] >= distance[current]) { // Found a cycle
                    return distance[current] + distance[neighbor] + 1;
                }
            }
        }

        return Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[][] edges = { {0, 1}, {1, 2}, {2, 0}, {1, 4}, {4, 3} };
        int n = 5; // Number of vertices
        System.out.println(sol.findShortestCycle(n, edges)); // Output should be 3
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:

- The adjacency list construction takes `O(E)` where `E` is the number of edges.
- The BFS traversal takes `O(V + E)` for each starting vertex `V`. Since we perform a BFS for each vertex, the overall time complexity is `O(V * (V + E))`.

## Space Complexity:

- The space complexity is `O(V + E)` for the adjacency list.
- Additionally, the BFS queue and distance array consume `O(V)` space. Hence, the total space complexity is `O(V + E)`.
