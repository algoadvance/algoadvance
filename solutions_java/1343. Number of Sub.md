[Leetcode 1343. Number of Sub](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1343)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `arr` and two integers `k` and `threshold`, return the number of sub-arrays of size `k` and average greater than or equal to `threshold`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of the input values (size of the array, elements in the array, values for k and threshold)?
   - The size of the array can be between 1 and 10^5.
   - The elements in the array are integers within the range -10^4 to 10^4.
   - `k` will be a positive integer and `threshold` will be an integer.

2. How should we handle edge cases, such as if k is larger than the length of the array?
   - We can assume here that k will always be less than or equal to the length of the array as per the problem constraints.

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a sliding window approach. This approach helps in maintaining a sum of a sub-array of size `k` and rolling the window to the right by subtracting the element that is left out of the window and adding the new element entering the window.

### Steps
1. Initialize two variables:
   - `sum` to store the sum of the current window of size `k`.
   - `count` to store the number of valid sub-arrays found.

2. First, calculate the sum of the initial window of size `k`.

3. Check if this sum divided by `k` is greater than or equal to `threshold`, if yes, increment the count.

4. Slide the window one element to the right by subtracting the element that's going out of the window and adding the element that comes into the window from the right.

5. Repeat step 3 for each new window.

6. Return `count`.

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    public int numOfSubarrays(int[] arr, int k, int threshold) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int sum = 0;
        int count = 0;

        // Calculate the sum of the first window of size k
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            sum += arr[i];
        }

        // Check if the first window meets the threshold condition
        if (sum >= k * threshold) {
            count++;
        }

        // Slide the window across the array
        for (int i = k; i < n; i++) {
            // Update the window sum to include new element and exclude the old element
            sum = sum + arr[i] - arr[i - k];

            // Check the condition for the new window
            if (sum >= k * threshold) {
                count++;
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the array. The reason is that we pass through the array once to generate the sum in the beginning and then iterate from k to n, updating the sliding window sum in constant time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), no additional space other than the few variables used is required.

In summary, this approach efficiently counts the number of sub-arrays of size `k` where the average is greater than or equal to `threshold` using the sliding window technique.
