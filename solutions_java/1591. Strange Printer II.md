[Leetcode 1591. Strange Printer II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1591)
### Problem Statement

Given a `m x n` matrix `target`, return `true` if it is possible to obtain the matrix `target` by applying some _number_ of operations on an initially all white `m x n` matrix `mat`, otherwise return `false`.

An operation consists of choosing any submatrix of `mat` and toggling all the cells within that submatrix (changing white cells to black cells and vice versa).

Each cell of the matrix `mat` is initially white represented by `0` and can be toggled any number of times.

### Example

#### Example 1
```text
Input: target = [[1,1,1],[1,1,1],[1,1,1]]
Output: true
Explanation: We choose the whole matrix and toggle it once.
```

#### Example 2
```text
Input: target = [[1,0,1],[0,0,0],[1,0,1]]
Output: false
Explanation: There is no way to obtain target matrix with given operation.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What are the constraints on the matrix dimensions `m` and `n`?
   **A:** 1 <= m, n <= 50.

2. **Q:** What values can the elements of the target matrix take?
   **A:** The elements of the target matrix are either `0` or `1`.

3. **Q:** Can any submatrix be chosen in the operations?
   **A:** Yes, any contiguous submatrix can be chosen in each operation.

### Strategy

The key to solving this problem is to understand the nature of the operations and how they affect the matrix. Since toggling a submatrix inverts all its cells, the problem essentially becomes a puzzle of finding out if we can achieve the target pattern using a series of such toggle operations starting from an all-zero matrix.

We can break down the problem into these steps:

1. Identify the distinct "blocks" of `1s` in the target matrix.
2. Determine if we can sequentially toggle these blocks on an initially all-zero matrix to recreate the target matrix.

### Code

Let's write the solution step by step:

1. Identify the distinct blocks (rectangular submatrices) of `1`s.
2. Check if toggling these blocks in an optimal sequence can produce the target matrix.

Here's the Java implementation:

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean isPrintable(int[][] target) {
        int m = target.length, n = target[0].length;
        int[] xmin = new int[61], xmax = new int[61], ymin = new int[61], ymax = new int[61];
        for (int i = 0; i < 61; ++i) {
            xmin[i] = 100;
            ymin[i] = 100;
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                int c = target[i][j];
                xmin[c] = Math.min(xmin[c], i);
                xmax[c] = Math.max(xmax[c], i);
                ymin[c] = Math.min(ymin[c], j);
                ymax[c] = Math.max(ymax[c], j);
            }
        }

        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[m][n];
        for (int c = 1; c <= 60; ++c) {
            if (xmin[c] == 100) continue;
            for (int i = xmin[c]; i <= xmax[c]; ++i) {
                for (int j = ymin[c]; j <= ymax[c]; ++j) {
                    if (target[i][j] != c && !visited[i][j]) {
                        return false;
                    }
                }
            }
            for (int i = xmin[c]; i <= xmax[c]; ++i) {
                for (int j = ymin[c]; j <= ymax[c]; ++j) {
                    visited[i][j] = true;
                }
            }
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is `O(m * n)`, where `m` and `n` are the dimensions of the matrix. This is because we traverse the entire matrix multiple times but the overall operations are linear with respect to the number of elements in the matrix. The space complexity is also `O(m * n)` due to the use of the `visited` array.
