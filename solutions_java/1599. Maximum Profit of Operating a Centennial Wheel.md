[Leetcode 1599. Maximum Profit of Operating a Centennial Wheel](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1599)
### Problem Statement

You are the operator of a Centennial Wheel that has four gondolas, each with a capacity of `4` people. You have a queue of people waiting to ride the wheel, those people come in groups. Each group has a different number of people.

The wheel rotates counterclockwise at a constant speed, and each rotation costs `runningCost` dollars. You earn `boardingCost` dollars for each boarding person.

You are given an array `customers` where `customers[i]` is the number of people in the i-th group waiting to board the wheel, and two integers `boardingCost` and `runningCost`. You can stop the wheel at any time. 

Return the minimum number of rotations you need to maximize your profit. If there is no scenario where the profit is positive, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **How many rotations can we perform?**
    - There is no specific limit to the number of rotations; you continue until there are no more people or stopping would not increase profit.
  
2. **Can the wheel be stopped and started again?**
    - The wheel cannot be stopped and then started again to optimize boarding; each group boards in the order of their appearance.

3. **What happens if there are not enough people to fill a gondola completely?**
    - The wheel will rotate even if the gondola is not full.

4. **Is there any initial profit or running cost before the first rotation?**
    - No, the count starts after the first rotation when people start boarding.

Now that we have a clear understanding of the problem, let's outline our strategy.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Variables**:
    - `totalProfit = 0` to track the total profit.
    - `maxProfit = 0` to track the maximum profit observed.
    - `bestRotation = -1` to track the best rotation where max profit is observed.
    - `currentRotation = 0` to keep track of current rotation.
    - `waitingPeople = 0` to track the current number of people waiting when groups are partially handled.
    - `totalBoarded = 0` to track the number of people boarded on the wheel.

2. **Iterate Through the Groups**:
    - Use a while loop to iterate through all groups until there are no more people waiting.
    - For each rotation, calculate the number of people boarding, the profit, and the updated waiting list.

3. **Calculate profit for each rotation**:
    - Boarding people and earning boardingCost for each.
    - Reducing waitingPeople by the number of people who boarded.
    - Subtracting runningCost for each rotation.
    - Compare current profit with maxProfit and update if necessary.

4. **End Condition**:
    - Stop the loop when there are neither customers to board nor groups left to process.
    - Return the best rotation observed or `-1` if no profit is positive.

### Code

```java
public class CentennialWheel {
    
    public int minOperationsMaxProfit(int[] customers, int boardingCost, int runningCost) {
        int totalProfit = 0;
        int maxProfit = 0;
        int bestRotation = -1;
        int currentRotation = 0;
        int waitingPeople = 0;
        int totalBoarded = 0;
        
        int i = 0;
        int n = customers.length;
        
        while (waitingPeople > 0 || i < n) {
            if (i < n) {
                waitingPeople += customers[i];
                i++;
            }
            
            int boardingPeople = Math.min(4, waitingPeople);
            totalBoarded += boardingPeople;
            waitingPeople -= boardingPeople;
            
            totalProfit = (totalBoarded * boardingCost) - (currentRotation + 1) * runningCost;
            
            if (totalProfit > maxProfit) {
                maxProfit = totalProfit;
                bestRotation = currentRotation + 1;
            }
            
            currentRotation++;
        }
        
        return maxProfit > 0 ? bestRotation : -1;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CentennialWheel cw = new CentennialWheel();
        int[] customers = {8,3,8,3,8};
        int boardingCost = 5;
        int runningCost = 6;
        System.out.println(cw.minOperationsMaxProfit(customers, boardingCost, runningCost));  // Should output the maximum profit rotation number.
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n + k)`
    - `n` is the length of the `customers` array.
    - `k` is the number of additional rotations after the last customer (could be up to `(total customers / 4)`).

This solution ensures that we maximize the profit while adhering to the constraints of boarding and operational costs.
