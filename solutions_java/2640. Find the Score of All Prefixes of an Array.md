[Leetcode 2640. Find the Score of All Prefixes of an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2640)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed array `nums` of integers. The **prefix score** of `nums` at index `i` is the sum of all elements of the prefix `nums[0]` to `nums[i]` inclusively.

Please write a function `findPrefixScore` that returns an array of integers, where the `i-th` integer is the prefix score of the `nums` at index `i`.

### Example:

```java
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: [1, 3, 6, 10, 15]
Explanation: The prefix scores are calculated as follows:
- The prefix ending at 0 is [1]: score is 1.
- The prefix ending at 1 is [1, 2]: score is 1 + 2 = 3.
- The prefix ending at 2 is [1, 2, 3]: score is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6.
- The prefix ending at 3 is [1, 2, 3, 4]: score is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10.
- The prefix ending at 4 is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]: score is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input array be empty?**
   - No. Based on the constraints, the array will always have at least one element.

2. **Can the nums array contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes. The array can contain negative numbers.

3. **What is the maximum size of the input array?**
   - This will typically be defined by the platform constraints (for instance, up to \(10^5\) elements on LeetCode).

## Strategy

To find the prefix score of an array `nums`, you need to maintain a running sum of the elements you have seen so far. Specifically, for each element in the array, you can add it to a cumulative sum and store this sum in a result array.

### Steps:
1. Initialize an empty result array and a variable to keep track of the cumulative sum.
2. Iterate through the `nums` array.
3. For each element, update the cumulative sum with the current element.
4. Append the cumulative sum to the result array.
5. Return the result array.

This approach ensures that each element is processed exactly once, leading to a linear time complexity.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] findPrefixScore(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] result = new int[n];
        int cumulativeSum = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            cumulativeSum += nums[i];
            result[i] = cumulativeSum;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    // For testing the function
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int[] result = sol.findPrefixScore(nums);
        for (int score : result) {
            System.out.print(score + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is **O(n)**, where **n** is the length of the `nums` array. This is because we are iterating through the array a single time to compute the prefix sums. The space complexity is also **O(n)** for storing the result array.
