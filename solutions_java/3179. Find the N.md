[Leetcode 3179. Find the N](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3179)
### Problem Statement

You are given an infinite sequence of numbers starting from 1. Every `K` seconds, each number in the sequence is incremented by 1 indefinitely.

You need to find the value of the N-th number in this sequence after `K` seconds.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the input format?**
   - We will receive three integers: `N`, `K`.

2. **What is the output format?**
   - We need to return an integer which is the value of the N-th number after `K` seconds.

3. **Are the values of N and K guaranteed to be positive integers?**
   - Yes, both `N` and `K` will always be positive integers.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, consider:
- Initially, the sequence looks like this: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...
- After K seconds, each number in the sequence has been incremented K times.

Given these steps:
1. The N-th number in the sequence starts as `N`.
2. After K seconds, `N` has been incremented `K` times.

Thus, the final value of the N-th number can be directly calculated as:
\[ N_{after} = N + K \]

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \( O(1) \) because it involves a simple arithmetic operation.

### Code

Here is the Java implementation:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int findNthValueAfterKSeconds(int N, int K) {
        // The N-th value after K seconds will be N + K
        return N + K;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        // Test cases
        System.out.println(sol.findNthValueAfterKSeconds(3, 4)); // Expected Output: 7
        System.out.println(sol.findNthValueAfterKSeconds(1, 5)); // Expected Output: 6
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Function Definition:** The function `findNthValueAfterKSeconds` takes two integers `N` and `K` as input.
2. **Calculation:** Using simple arithmetic, it calculates \( N + K \) and returns the result.
3. **Main Method:** The `main` method is used to test the function with different test cases.

This solution is efficient, clear, and adheres to the requirements given in the problem statement.
