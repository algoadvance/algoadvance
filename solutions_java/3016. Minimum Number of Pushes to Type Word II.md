[Leetcode 3016. Minimum Number of Pushes to Type Word II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3016)
### Problem Statement:

You are given a 2-dimensional keyboard layout and a word. The keyboard is represented by a list of strings with lowercase English letters and each string represents a row on the keyboard. You are required to type the given word by starting at any key in the first row and pressing keys sequentially to form the word. You can move up, down, left, and right to reach the next key. The task is to determine the minimum number of key presses (including moves) required to type the entire word.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Are the rows of the keyboard guaranteed to be of the same length?**
   - Yes, each string in the list representing the keyboard rows has the same length.

2. **Can we start from any position in the first row of the keyboard?**
   - Yes, you can start from any position in the first row.

3. **What should be returned if the word cannot be typed given the keyboard layout?**
   - We should assume that the word is always typeable given the keyboard layout.

4. **What are the constraints on the size of the keyboard and the length of the word?**
   - Typically, keyboard layouts are small (e.g., 3x10 or 4x10), and word lengths will be manageable under typical constraints (e.g., length of the word up to 100).

### Strategy:

To solve this problem, the following steps can be taken:

1. **Map the positions of each letter on the keyboard:** Create a dictionary to store the positions (i, j) for each letter on the keyboard.
2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:** Use a table `dp[i][j]` to keep track of the minimum number of pushes needed to type the word up to position `i` of the word if we end on the key at position `j`.
3. **Initialization:** Initialize the first row of the `dp` table with distances from each starting position in the first row to the first character of the word.
4. **Transition Between States:** For each character in the word, calculate the minimum number of pushes required to move from each possible position of the previous character to the position of the current character.
5. **Compute Result:** The answer will be the minimum value in the last row of the `dp` table.

### Code:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class MinimumPushesToTypeWord {

    public int minPushes(String[] keyboard, String word) {
        int rows = keyboard.length;
        int cols = keyboard[0].length();
        int n = word.length();
        
        // Store positions of each letter
        Map<Character, int[]> pos = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                pos.put(keyboard[i].charAt(j), new int[]{i, j});
            }
        }
        
        // Initialize DP table
        int[][] dp = new int[n][rows * cols];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < rows * cols; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            }
        }
        
        // Start from any position in the first row
        for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            dp[0][j] = Math.abs(0 - pos.get(word.charAt(0))[0]) + Math.abs(j - pos.get(word.charAt(0))[1]);
        }
        
        // Fill DP table
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            char cur = word.charAt(i);
            for (int j = 0; j < rows * cols; j++) {
                int[] posPrev = pos.get(word.charAt(i - 1));
                int rowPrev = posPrev[0];
                int colPrev = posPrev[1];
                
                int rowCur = pos.get(cur)[0];
                int colCur = pos.get(cur)[1];
                
                int prevIdx = rowPrev * cols + colPrev;
                int curIdx = rowCur * cols + colCur;
                
                dp[i][curIdx] = Math.min(dp[i][curIdx], dp[i - 1][prevIdx] + 1 + Math.abs(rowCur - rowPrev) + Math.abs(colCur - colPrev));
            }
        }
        
        // Get minimum pushes from the last row of dp table
        int minPushes = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int j = 0; j < rows * cols; j++) {
            minPushes = Math.min(minPushes, dp[n - 1][j]);
        }
        
        return minPushes;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumPushesToTypeWord obj = new MinimumPushesToTypeWord();
        String[] keyboard = {"qwertyuiop", "asdfghjkl", "zxcvbnm"};
        String word = "cat";
        System.out.println(obj.minPushes(keyboard, word));  // output: minimum number of pushes to type "cat"
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this approach is **O(N * (R \* C)^2)**, where \(N\) is the length of the word, \(R\) is the number of rows, and \(C\) is the number of columns in the keyboard. This complexity arises because, for each character in the word, we may need to compare costs across all positions (rows * cols) of the previous and current characters.
