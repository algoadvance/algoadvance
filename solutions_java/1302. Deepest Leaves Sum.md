[Leetcode 1302. Deepest Leaves Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1302)
## Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, return the sum of values of its deepest leaves.

### Example:
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,null,6,7,null,null,null,null,8]
Output: 15
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. What constitutes the deepest leaves in the tree?
   - The deepest leaves in the tree are the leaf nodes that are at the maximum depth from the root.
2. Will the tree always have at least one node?
   - Yes, the tree will have at least one node.
3. Can the node values be negative?
   - Yes, node values can be negative.
4. What is the maximum height or number of nodes in the binary tree?
   - This isn't explicitly specified, but we should aim to handle reasonably large trees efficiently.

## Strategy
1. **Level-Order Traversal (BFS)**:
   - Use a queue to perform a level-order traversal of the tree.
   - Keep track of the sum of node values at each level.
   - The last level's sum will be the answer since it represents the deepest leaves.

2. Alternatively, we can use a **Depth-First Search (DFS)** approach:
   - Record the depth of each node and its value.
   - Track the maximum depth encountered and maintain a sum of values at this deepest level.
  
For simplicity and clarity, we'll go with the BFS approach.

## Code
Here is the Java code using the BFS approach for clarity and readability:

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode() {}
    TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
    TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

public class DeepestLeavesSum {
    public int deepestLeavesSum(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(root);
        int sum = 0;
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int levelSize = queue.size();
            sum = 0; // Reset sum for the new level
            
            for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
                TreeNode current = queue.poll();
                sum += current.val;
                
                if (current.left != null) {
                    queue.offer(current.left);
                }
                if (current.right != null) {
                    queue.offer(current.right);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return sum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example usage
        TreeNode root = new TreeNode(1,
                            new TreeNode(2, 
                                            new TreeNode(4, new TreeNode(7), null), 
                                            new TreeNode(5)
                                        ),
                            new TreeNode(3,
                                            null, 
                                            new TreeNode(6, null, new TreeNode(8))
                                        )
                          );
        DeepestLeavesSum dls = new DeepestLeavesSum();
        System.out.println(dls.deepestLeavesSum(root)); // Output: 15
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(D), where D is the maximum number of nodes at any depth level. In the worst case, it might be O(N) if the tree is completely unbalanced, but typically it's less.

This ensures we efficiently calculate the sum of the deepest leaves in the tree.
