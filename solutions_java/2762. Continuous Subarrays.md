[Leetcode 2762. Continuous Subarrays full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2762)
### Problem Statement

We need to solve the following LeetCode problem:

**2762. Continuous Subarrays**

You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. Your goal is to return the number of continuous subarrays whose sum is equal to `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size range of the array `nums`?**
   - `nums.length` can be very large, up to \( 10^5 \).

2. **Can `nums` contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, `nums` can have negative, zero, and positive numbers.

3. **What is the range of integer `k`?**
   - The value of `k` could be any integer, positive, negative, or zero.

4. **Is there any constraint on the time complexity?**
   - Ideally, the solution should be as efficient as possible, preferably better than O(n^2).

### Strategy

The most efficient way to solve this problem is by using a hash map to keep track of the cumulative sums encountered so far. This way, we can achieve the solution in O(n) time complexity.

1. **Initialize cumulative sum and hash map**:
   - Start with a cumulative sum of 0.
   - Use a hash map to store occurrences of cumulative sums.
   - Initialize the hash map with `{0: 1}` to handle the case where a subarray itself starts from the beginning.

2. **Iterate through the array once**:
   - For each element `nums[i]`, update the cumulative sum.
   - Check if the cumulative sum minus `k` exists in the hash map. If it does, it means there is a subarray ending at the current index whose sum is `k`.
   - Increment the result by the count of times this `cumulative_sum - k` has appeared.
   - Update the hash map with the new cumulative sum.

3. **Return the total count of subarrays with sum equal to `k`.**

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class ContinuousSubarrays {
    public int subarraySum(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Initialize hashmap to store cumulative sums
        Map<Integer, Integer> cumulativeSumMap = new HashMap<>();
        cumulativeSumMap.put(0, 1);
        
        int cumulativeSum = 0;
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            cumulativeSum += num;
            
            if (cumulativeSumMap.containsKey(cumulativeSum - k)) {
                count += cumulativeSumMap.get(cumulativeSum - k);
            }
            
            cumulativeSumMap.put(cumulativeSum, cumulativeSumMap.getOrDefault(cumulativeSum, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - We are iterating over the array once.
  - Hash map operations (insert, get, contains) are expected to be O(1) on average.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - In the worst case, we might store all cumulative sums in the hash map.

This approach ensures that we solve the problem efficiently even for large input sizes.
