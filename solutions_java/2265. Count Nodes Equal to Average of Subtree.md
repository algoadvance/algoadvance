[Leetcode 2265. Count Nodes Equal to Average of Subtree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2265)
### Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, return the number of nodes where the value of the node is equal to the average of the values in its subtree.

A subtree of a node `node` is the tree consisting of `node` and all of its descendants. The average of the subtree is the sum of all the values in the subtree divided by the number of nodes in the subtree.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Subtree Definition**: Does the subtree include the given node and all of its descendants?
   - Yes, the subtree includes the node and its descendants.
2. **Node Value Range**: Are there any constraints on the node values?
   - Typically, node values can be any integer (positive, negative, or zero).

### Strategy
To determine how many nodes fulfill this condition, we need to:
1. Traverse the tree using DFS (Depth-First Search).
2. Calculate the sum and count of nodes in each subtree.
3. For each node, check if its value equals the average of its subtree.

To implement this, we'll use a helper function that returns both the sum and count of nodes for each subtree. We'll compare each node's value with the computed average (sum / count) and count the number of such nodes.

### Code
Here's how we can implement our strategy in Java:

```java
class Solution {
    private class Result {
        int sum;
        int count;
        
        Result(int sum, int count) {
            this.sum = sum;
            this.count = count;
        }
    }
    
    private int count = 0;
    
    public int averageOfSubtree(TreeNode root) {
        computeSubtreeSumAndCount(root);
        return count;
    }
    
    private Result computeSubtreeSumAndCount(TreeNode node) {
        if (node == null) {
            return new Result(0, 0);
        }
        
        Result left = computeSubtreeSumAndCount(node.left);
        Result right = computeSubtreeSumAndCount(node.right);
        
        int sum = node.val + left.sum + right.sum;
        int countNodes = 1 + left.count + right.count;
        
        // Check if this node's value is equal to the integer average of its subtree
        if (node.val == (sum / countNodes)) {
            count++;
        }
        
        return new Result(sum, countNodes);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Traversal**: Each node is visited once.
- **Calculation**: For each node, we perform a constant amount of work (adding, dividing).
- The overall time complexity is `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we traverse each node exactly once.

### Summary
- We perform a DFS to compute the sum and number of nodes in each subtree.
- For each node, we check whether its value equals the average of its subtree.
- This approach ensures that we efficiently solve the problem with a time complexity of `O(N)`.
