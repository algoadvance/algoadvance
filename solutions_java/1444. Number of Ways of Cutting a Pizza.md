[Leetcode 1444. Number of Ways of Cutting a Pizza](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1444)
### Problem Statement

You are given a rectangular pizza represented as an `m x n` binary matrix with cells equal to 0 (no apple) or 1 (contains apple). You also have k slices that you can make at most. The goal is to determine the number of ways to cut the pizza into exactly k non-empty pieces. Each cut can be either horizontal or vertical and must pass through a row or column of apples. Return the number of ways modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Example
``` 
Input: pizza = ["A..","AAA","..."], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The pizza can be cut as follows:
1. (0,0) to (1,0), (2,0) to (2,2)
2. (0,0) to (0,1), (1,0) to (2,0), (1,2) to (2,2)
3. (0,0) to (0,1), (1,0) to (1,2), (2,0) to (2,2)
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Matrix Representation**: Are dimensions fixed, and are rows and columns containing only a fixed set of characters?
   - Yes, the pizza dimensions are defined by the problem and only contain 'A' for apple and '.' for no apple.
   
2. **Slices**: Should slices contain at least one apple?
   - Yes, each slice needs to contain at least one apple.
   
3. **Boundaries**: Are slices automatically non-empty if containing apples, and do cuts need to be continuous?
   - Yes, slices must be continuous and contain at least one apple.

### Strategy
1. **Use Dynamic Programming**:
   - Create a 3D DP array `dp[i][j][k]` to store the number of ways to cut the pizza starting at (i, j) with k cuts left.
   
2. **Precompute Sums**:
   - Use a 2D array `prefixSum` where `prefixSum[r][c]` contains the number of apples in the submatrix starting from (r, c) to the bottom-right corner.

3. **Recursive Formula**:
   - Iterate over possible cuts and use the prefix sums to check for validity.

4. **DP Transition**:
   - For horizontal cuts, split the matrix and ensure both parts contain apples using prefix sums.
   - For vertical cuts, similarly split and validate.

5. **Base Case**:
   - Initialize the base case where no more cuts left when starting from (i, j).

### Time Complexity
The solution involves iterating through the matrix and potential cuts, resulting in a time complexity of `O(k * m^2 * n^2)`. To optimize, leveraging prefix sums speeds up apple count checks.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class NumberOfWaysOfCuttingAPizza {
    private static final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;

    public int ways(String[] pizza, int k) {
        int m = pizza.length;
        int n = pizza[0].length();
        int[][][] dp = new int[m][n][k + 1];
        int[][] prefixSum = new int[m + 1][n + 1];

        // Compute prefix sums
        for (int i = m - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = n - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                prefixSum[i][j] = (pizza[i].charAt(j) == 'A' ? 1 : 0)
                        + prefixSum[i + 1][j]
                        + prefixSum[i][j + 1]
                        - prefixSum[i + 1][j + 1];
            }
        }

        // dp initialization
        for (int[][] d : dp) {
            for (int[] d2 : d) {
                Arrays.fill(d2, -1);
            }
        }

        return dfs(dp, prefixSum, 0, 0, k - 1);
    }

    private int dfs(int[][][] dp, int[][] prefixSum, int i, int j, int k) {
        if (prefixSum[i][j] == 0) return 0;
        if (k == 0) return 1;
        if (dp[i][j][k] != -1) return dp[i][j][k];

        int m = dp.length;
        int n = dp[0].length;
        int ways = 0;

        // Horizontal cuts
        for (int x = i + 1; x < m; x++) {
            if (prefixSum[i][j] - prefixSum[x][j] > 0) {
                ways = (ways + dfs(dp, prefixSum, x, j, k - 1)) % MOD;
            }
        }

        // Vertical cuts
        for (int y = j + 1; y < n; y++) {
            if (prefixSum[i][j] - prefixSum[i][y] > 0) {
                ways = (ways + dfs(dp, prefixSum, i, y, k - 1)) % MOD;
            }
        }

        dp[i][j][k] = ways;
        return ways;
    }
}
```

This code initializes the matrix and the prefix sum for quick apple checks, then recursively applies the DP approach to count valid splits. The result is ensured to be within the modulo constraint.
