[Leetcode 986. Interval List Intersections](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l986)
### Problem Statement

You are given two lists of closed intervals, `firstList` and `secondList`, where `firstList[i] = [start_i, end_i]` and `secondList[j] = [start_j, end_j]`. Each list of intervals is pairwise disjoint and in sorted order.

Return the intersection of these two interval lists.

A closed interval `[a, b]` (with `a <= b`) denotes the set of real numbers `x` with `a <= x <= b`.

The intersection of two closed intervals is a set of real numbers that are either empty or represented as a closed interval. For example, the intersection of `[1, 3]` and `[2, 4]` is `[2, 3]`.

### Example
```
Input: firstList = [[0,2],[5,10],[13,23],[24,25]], secondList = [[1,5],[8,12],[15,24],[25,26]]
Output: [[1,2],[5,5],[8,10],[15,23],[24,24],[25,25]]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the input intervals be empty? 
   - Yes, it is possible for one or both input lists to be empty.
2. Are the intervals within each list guaranteed to be non-overlapping?
   - Yes, each list contains non-overlapping intervals which are sorted by their starting points.
3. Can two intervals partially overlap, completely overlap, or be disjoint?
   - Yes, intersections can be partial, completely overlapping, or there might be no intersection at all.

With these clarifications in mind, let's proceed to the strategy and code.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Two Pointers**: Use two pointers to iterate through both lists, `i` for `firstList` and `j` for `secondList`.
2. **Check Overlap**: For each pair of intervals `firstList[i]` and `secondList[j]`:
   - Calculate the start and end of the potential intersecting interval.
   - There is an intersection if the calculated start is less than or equal to the calculated end.
3. **Move Pointers**: Based on the endpoint of the intervals, move the pointer for the list that has the smaller endpoint.
4. **Edge Cases**: Consider cases where either list is empty; this leads to an immediate result of an empty list.

### Code
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class IntervalListIntersections {
    public int[][] intervalIntersection(int[][] firstList, int[][] secondList) {
        List<int[]> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int i = 0, j = 0;

        while (i < firstList.length && j < secondList.length) {
            // Find the start and end of the possible intersection
            int start = Math.max(firstList[i][0], secondList[j][0]);
            int end = Math.min(firstList[i][1], secondList[j][1]);

            // If there's an intersection, add it to the result list
            if (start <= end) {
                result.add(new int[]{start, end});
            }

            // Move the pointer which has the smaller endpoint
            if (firstList[i][1] < secondList[j][1]) {
                i++;
            } else {
                j++;
            }
        }

        // Convert the result list to an array
        return result.toArray(new int[result.size()][]);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        IntervalListIntersections solution = new IntervalListIntersections();
        int[][] firstList = {{0, 2}, {5, 10}, {13, 23}, {24, 25}};
        int[][] secondList = {{1, 5}, {8, 12}, {15, 24}, {25, 26}};
        int[][] result = solution.intervalIntersection(firstList, secondList);

        // Printing result
        for (int[] interval : result) {
            System.out.print("[" + interval[0] + "," + interval[1] + "] ");
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n + m)
  - We iterate through both lists once, where `n` is the length of `firstList` and `m` is the length of `secondList`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We use a fixed amount of extra space aside from the output list, whose size depends on the number of intersections.

This approach ensures efficient computation of interval intersections with minimal additional overhead.
