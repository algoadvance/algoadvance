[Leetcode 213. House Robber II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l213)
### Problem Statement:
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have a security system connected, and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house, return the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Q**: What should be returned if the `nums` array is empty?
   **A**: Return 0 since there are no houses to rob.
2. **Q**: What should be returned if `nums` contains only one house?
   **A**: Return the value of the single element since it represents the only house present.
3. **Q**: Can `nums` have non-integer or negative values?
   **A**: No, `nums` is specified to hold non-negative integers only.

### Strategy:
The problem can be viewed as a variation of the House Robber I problem but with the added complexity of the houses being in a circle. The key to solving this problem is to handle it as two separate linear House Robber problems:

1. **Rob houses from index 0 to n-2** - ignoring the last house.
2. **Rob houses from index 1 to n-1** - ignoring the first house.

The solution will be the maximum amount robbed from the above two scenarios.

### Code:
```java
public class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) return 0;
        if (nums.length == 1) return nums[0];

        // Helper function to perform the simple robbing along a line (House Robber I)
        return Math.max(robLinear(nums, 0, nums.length - 2), robLinear(nums, 1, nums.length - 1));
    }

    private int robLinear(int[] nums, int start, int end) {
        int prev1 = 0, prev2 = 0;
        for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
            int current = Math.max(prev1, prev2 + nums[i]);
            prev2 = prev1;
            prev1 = current;
        }
        return prev1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {2, 3, 2};
        System.out.println(solution.rob(nums));  // Output: 3
        
        nums = new int[]{1, 2, 3, 1};
        System.out.println(solution.rob(nums));  // Output: 4
        
        nums = new int[]{0};
        System.out.println(solution.rob(nums));  // Output: 0
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity for this solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the number of houses. This is because both scenarios (rob from 0 to n-2 and rob from 1 to n-1) each take linear time to calculate, leading to an overall linear time complexity. 

- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we're only using a constant amount of extra space for variables.
