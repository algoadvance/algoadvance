[Leetcode 2875. Minimum Size Subarray in Infinite Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2875)
### Problem Statement:

You are given a **0-indexed** array `nums` containing `n` positive integers.

You need to apply `k` right rotations on an array consisting of `m` concatenations of `nums`.

Return the **minimum size** of a subarray (can be of size `0`) such that its concatenation is equal to the **kth** rotation of the concatenated array.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **What does 'k right rotations' mean?**
   - A right rotation by one means removing the last element of the array and adding it to the front.

2. **What is the final shape and length of the array after m concatenations?**
   - If `n` is the length of the original array `nums`, then the final concatenated array will have a length of `n * m`.

3. **What are the constraints?**
   - `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5`
   - `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^9`

### Strategy:

1. Compute the effective `k` for the array of length `n * m` after multiple rotations:
   - Since rotating by the length of the array results in the same array, we can reduce `k` modulo `n * m`.

2. Identify the smallest subarray that constitutes the required rotation:
   - This involves finding a subarray `nums[start...end]` such that its rotation forms the necessary segment of the concatenated array corresponding to the `k-th` rotation.

3. Consider edge cases:
   - If `k` is a multiple of the total length, the rotation results in the original array.
   - Empty subarrays.

### Code:

```java
public class MinimumSizeSubarrayRotation {

    public int minSizeSubarrayInInfiniteArray(int[] nums, int m, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int totalLength = n * m;
        
        k = k % totalLength; // Reduce k to the effective number of rotations
        
        if (k == 0) { // k == 0 means no rotation is required
            return 0;
        }
        
        // We need to find the smallest subarray whose rotation gives us a segment
        // equivalent to the k-th rotated array
        
        // Building the concatenated array example
        int[] extendedNums = new int[n * 2];
        System.arraycopy(nums, 0, extendedNums, 0, n);
        System.arraycopy(nums, 0, extendedNums, n, n);
        
        int minLength = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        // Sliding window to find the smallest subarray whose k-th rotation would match
        for(int start = 0; start < n; start++) {
            int end = start;
            int length = 0;
            while(length < k && end < n * 2) {
                length++;
                end++;
            }
            if(length == k) {
                minLength = Math.min(minLength, end - start);
            }
        }
        
        return minLength == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? 0 : minLength;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumSizeSubarrayRotation solution = new MinimumSizeSubarrayRotation();
        
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4};
        int m = 3;
        int k = 10; // effectively 10 % (4 * 3) = 10 % 12 = 10
        System.out.println(solution.minSizeSubarrayInInfiniteArray(nums, m, k)); // Expected output is the minimum length of the subarray.
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the nums array. The sliding window approach applied to a maximally doubled array results in linear time complexity relative to the length of the original array since we iterate up to at most `2n`.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)`, due to the construction of the doubled array `extendedNums`.

This solution assumes that the necessary segment for the rotation can be found within two concatenations of `nums`. This is a generalized approach which efficiently narrows down the search space for minimal subarrays.
