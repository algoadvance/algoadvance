[Leetcode 3127. Make a Square with the Same Color](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3127)
Sure, I'd be glad to help you with that problem. However, I don't have the exact problem details from LeetCode. Let's create a problem statement based on the title and then work through it.

### Problem Statement:

Given a 2D grid of size `n x n` representing a tiled floor, where each cell is represented by either 'R' (Red) or 'B' (Blue), determine the minimum number of tiles you need to change to form at least one `2 x 2` square of the same color. You can only change the color of one tile at a time.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Is the grid always a square (n x n)?**
   - Yes, the grid is always a square matrix.

2. **Are there any constraints on the size of the grid (e.g., 1 <= n <= 1000)?**
   - Let's assume reasonable constraints such as \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) for this problem.

3. **What should be the output if the grid is already full of the same color?**
   - If the grid is already full of the same color, then 0 changes are required.

4. **What should we consider if the input has mixed colors uniformly?**
   - Focus on finding the minimum number of changes to form at least one `2 x 2` square.

With the assumed problem and constraints, let's proceed with the code and strategy.

### Strategy:

1. **Iterate through the grid:**
   - Traverse each cell and treat it as the top-left corner of a potential `2 x 2` square.

2. **Evaluate the cost of changing a `2 x 2` square:**
   - For each such square, calculate the number of changes needed to make it all 'R' or all 'B'.
   - Keep track of the minimum changes required among all possible `2 x 2` squares.

3. **Output the minimum changes:**
   - Once all possible squares are evaluated, the result will be the minimum number of tile changes needed.

### Code:

```java
public class MakeSquareSameColor {
    public int minChangesToSquare(char[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        int minChanges = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        // Iterate over each cell (i, j) considering it as the top-left corner of a 2x2 square
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n - 1; j++) {
                // Calculate changes needed to make the 2x2 square all 'R'
                int changesToR = 0;
                int changesToB = 0;

                if (grid[i][j] != 'R') changesToR++;
                if (grid[i][j] != 'B') changesToB++;
                
                if (grid[i][j + 1] != 'R') changesToR++;
                if (grid[i][j + 1] != 'B') changesToB++;
                
                if (grid[i + 1][j] != 'R') changesToR++;
                if (grid[i + 1][j] != 'B') changesToB++;
                
                if (grid[i + 1][j + 1] != 'R') changesToR++;
                if (grid[i + 1][j + 1] != 'B') changesToB++;

                // Take the minimum changes needed for this square
                int changesForThisSquare = Math.min(changesToR, changesToB);
                
                // Update the global minimum changes needed
                minChanges = Math.min(minChanges, changesForThisSquare);
            }
        }

        return minChanges;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MakeSquareSameColor solution = new MakeSquareSameColor();
        char[][] grid = {
            {'R', 'B', 'R'},
            {'R', 'B', 'B'},
            {'B', 'R', 'B'}
        };
        System.out.println(solution.minChangesToSquare(grid));  // Output: 1
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the size of the grid.
  - We traverse each cell in the grid (except the last row and column) once, evaluating changes for a \(2 x 2\) square.
  
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\).
  - We use a constant amount of extra space for tracking the number of changes.

This completes the problem solution. If you have any specific requirements or additional clarifications needed, feel free to ask!
