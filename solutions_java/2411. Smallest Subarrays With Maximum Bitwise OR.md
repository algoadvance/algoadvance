[Leetcode 2411. Smallest Subarrays With Maximum Bitwise OR full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2411)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` of size `n`. For each index `i` (0 <= i < n), you need to determine the size of the smallest subarray starting at `i` that has the maximum possible bitwise OR among all subarrays starting at `i`.

Formally, for each index `i`, find the smallest integer `l(i)` such that the bitwise OR from `nums[i]` to `nums[i + l(i) - 1]` is maximized.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on the elements of `nums` and the size of the array `n`?**
   The array `nums` will have a size of `n`, where `1 <= n <= 10^5`. The elements of `nums` are integers in the range `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`.

2. **Clear definition of the bitwise OR operation?**
   Yes, the bitwise OR operation takes each pair of corresponding bits from two numbers and returns 1 if at least one of the bits is 1. Otherwise, it returns 0.

3. **Example for clarity:**
   - Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`
   - Output: `[3, 3, 3, 2, 1]`

   This means:
   - For starting index `0`, the smallest subarray with the maximum OR is of length 3 (`[1, 2, 3]`).
   - For starting index `1`, the smallest subarray with the maximum OR is of length 3 (`[2, 3, 4]`), and so on.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Observations:**
   - The maximum bitwise OR result for any subarray starting from `i` can be found by including elements until either the end of the array or until further inclusion doesn't change the OR result.
   
2. **Approach:**
   - Track the maximum OR we can get from the current index `i` to the end of the array.
   - Use a sliding window or a dynamic window to expand until the OR stops changing.

3. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Initialize an array `result` of size `n` where the final answer will be stored.
   - Iterate from the right end to the left end of `nums` to maintain the currently maximal OR.
   - For each index, find the smallest subarray length using expanding and tracking.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    public int[] smallestSubarrays(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] result = new int[n];
        int[] lastBitOccurrence = new int[32];
        Arrays.fill(lastBitOccurrence, -1);

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for (int j = 0; j < 32; j++) {
                if ((nums[i] & (1 << j)) != 0) {
                    lastBitOccurrence[j] = i;
                }
            }

            int maxLength = 1;
            for (int j = 0; j < 32; j++) {
                if (lastBitOccurrence[j] != -1) {
                    maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, lastBitOccurrence[j] - i + 1);
                }
            }
            result[i] = maxLength;
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(solution.smallestSubarrays(nums))); // Output: [3, 3, 3, 2, 1]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n \cdot 32)\) = \(O(n)\)
  - We iterate through the list once (O(n)).
  - For each element, we perform bitwise operations across 32 bits (constant time).

- **Space Complexity:** \(O(32)\) = \(O(1)\)
  - The additional space used for the `lastBitOccurrence` array is constant.

This approach ensures efficiency given the constraints. The result array gives the length of the smallest subarray starting at each index `i` with the maximum possible bitwise OR.
