[Leetcode 1771. Maximize Palindrome Length From Subsequences full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1771)
### Problem Statement

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, return the length of the longest palindromic subsequence that can be formed using characters from either `word1` or `word2`. The subsequence does not need to use any characters from both words but can mix characters from both words freely.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the subsequence use characters only from one of the strings?**
   - Yes, the subsequence can be formed using characters from either or both strings.

2. **Do the characters in the subsequence need to appear in the same order as in the original strings?**
   - No, the characters can be rearranged to form the palindromic subsequence.

3. **What is the maximum length for `word1` and `word2`?**
   - The maximum length for each string is 1000.

4. **Are the strings made up of only lowercase letters?**
   - Yes, both strings consists only of lowercase English letters.

### Strategy

To address this problem, Dynamic Programming (DP) is a good approach. Hereâ€™s an outline of the strategy:

1. **Combine Words**: Concatenate `word1` and `word2` into a single string `combined`.
2. **DP Array Initialization**: Create a DP table to store results of subproblems. Let `dp[i][j]` represent the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in `combined[i:j+1]`.
3. **Fill DP Table**:
   - If characters at both ends of the current substring are the same, they can form part of the palindrome.
   - If the characters are different, the longest palindromic subsequence will be the maximum length of the subsequences obtained by removing one of the end characters.
4. **Extract Result**:
   - The final answer will be in `dp[0][n-1]`, where `n` is the length of the combined string.

### Code

Here's the implementation based on the aforementioned strategy:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int longestPalindrome(String word1, String word2) {
        String combined = word1 + word2;
        int n = combined.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[n][n];
        
        // Initialize DP table.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i][i] = 1; // Every single character is a palindrome of length 1.
        }

        // Fill the DP table
        for (int len = 2; len <= n; len++) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - len; i++) {
                int j = i + len - 1;
                if (combined.charAt(i) == combined.charAt(j)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 2;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }

        // Find the longest palindromic subsequence that spans both words
        int longestLength = 0;
        int word1Len = word1.length();
        for (int i = 0; i < word1Len; i++) {
            for (int j = word1Len; j < n; j++) {
                if (combined.charAt(i) == combined.charAt(j)) {
                    longestLength = Math.max(longestLength, dp[i][j]);
                }
            }
        }

        return longestLength;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where `n` is the length of the combined string (`word1` + `word2`). This is because we are filling a DP table of size n x n.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n^2) due to the space required for the DP table.

By following this approach, we can efficiently find the length of the longest palindromic subsequence that uses characters from either or both `word1` and `word2`.
