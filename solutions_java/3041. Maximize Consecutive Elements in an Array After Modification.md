[Leetcode 3041. Maximize Consecutive Elements in an Array After Modification](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3041)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` representing the initial state of an array and an integer `k` representing the maximum number of operations you can perform. In one operation, you can increment any element of the array by 1. Your task is to maximize the number of consecutive elements in the array that have the same value after at most `k` operations.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,2,4], k = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: Increment the first element 4 times (to 5) and the second element 1 time (to 5). 
This makes the array [5,5,4] and you have 2 more operations left.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the elements in the array always non-negative?
    - Yes, the elements are non-negative integers.
2. Can the array have duplicates?
    - Yes, the array can have duplicates.
3. What should be returned if there are multiple possible solutions?
    - Return the maximum number of consecutive elements with the same value.
4. What are the constraints on the size of the array and the value of `k`?
    - Typical constraints on interview questions; letâ€™s assume `1 <= nums.length <= 100,000` and `1 <= nums[i] <= 1,000,000`.

### Strategy

The main idea is to use a sliding window approach to find a subarray where the elements can be incrementally modified to produce the maximum sequence of identical values:

1. **Sort the array**: It simplifies checking consecutive windows, as we need the modifications to be minimal.
2. **Use a sliding window**: Attempt to maximize the number of identical elements in a subarray. Keep track of the total number of required increments to make all elements in the subarray equal to the current maximum element in that window.
3. **Maintain a count of operations**: If the total increments exceed `k`, slide the window forward.

### Code
Here's the implementation of the above strategy in Java:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MaximizeConsecutiveElements {
    public int maxFrequency(int[] nums, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int n = nums.length;
        int left = 0;
        int right = 0;
        int maxFrequency = 0;
        long totalIncrement = 0;

        while (right < n) {
            // Add current element to the window
            totalIncrement += (long) nums[right];
            // Calculate the required increment to make all elements in the window equal to nums[right]
            long requiredIncrement = (long) nums[right] * (right - left + 1);
            
            // If the total increment is more than k, slide the window
            while (requiredIncrement - totalIncrement > k) {
                totalIncrement -= nums[left];
                left++;
                requiredIncrement = (long) nums[right] * (right - left + 1);
            }
            
            // Update the maximum frequency
            maxFrequency = Math.max(maxFrequency, right - left + 1);
            right++;
        }
        
        return maxFrequency;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximizeConsecutiveElements sol = new MaximizeConsecutiveElements();
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 4};
        int k = 5;
        System.out.println(sol.maxFrequency(nums, k)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **Sliding Window**: `O(n)` because each element is processed at most twice (once by `right` and once by `left`).

Thus, the total time complexity is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting operation, which is the dominant term.
