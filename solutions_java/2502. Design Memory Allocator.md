[Leetcode 2502. Design Memory Allocator](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2502)
### Problem Statement

You're tasked with designing a memory allocator manager, which can allocate and free memory in a 1D list. Specifically, you need to implement the following operations:

1. `allocate(size, mID)`: Allocates a block of memory of given `size` and assigns it the ID `mID`. Returns the starting index if successful and `-1` otherwise.
2. `free(mID)`: Frees all blocks of memory associated with `mID`. Returns the total number of memory units freed.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of values:** What is the maximum size of the memory list?
   - Assume the memory list has a fixed maximum size `N` (e.g., `N = 1000`).

2. **Initial state:** Is the memory initially empty (all blocks free)?
   - Yes, the memory is initially empty.

3. **Multiple allocations for the same `mID`:**
   - Are there any constraints or behaviors expected if `allocate` is called multiple times with the same `mID`?
     - Each allocation should be treated independently. 

4. **Freeing non-allocated `mID`**:
   - What happens if `free` is called with an `mID` that was never allocated or already freed?
     - Assume this always returns `0`.

### Code

Let's proceed to code the class `MemoryAllocator`:

```java
public class MemoryAllocator {
    private int[] memory;
    private int n;

    public MemoryAllocator(int capacity) {
        memory = new int[capacity];
        n = capacity;
    }

    public int allocate(int size, int mID) {
        // Find the first block of 'size' free spots
        for (int i = 0; i <= n - size; i++) {
            boolean canAllocate = true;
            for (int j = i; j < i + size; j++) {
                if (memory[j] != 0) {
                    canAllocate = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (canAllocate) {
                // Allocate memory
                for (int j = i; j < i + size; j++) {
                    memory[j] = mID;
                }
                return i;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }

    public int free(int mID) {
        int freedUnits = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (memory[i] == mID) {
                memory[i] = 0;
                freedUnits++;
            }
        }
        return freedUnits;
    }

    // For debugging purposes
    public void printMemory() {
        for (int value : memory) {
            System.out.print(value + " ");
        }
        System.out.println();
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:** The constructor initializes the memory array to the given capacity.
2. **Allocate:** The `allocate` method searches for a contiguous block of unallocated (zero) positions of the specified size and assigns the given `mID` if possible.
3. **Free:** The `free` method scans the array for the given `mID` and resets those positions to zero, counting the freed units.

### Time Complexity

1. **Allocate:**
   - Best Case: `O(1)` if the first block is free and of the required size.
   - Worst Case: `O(n * size)` where `n` is the length of the memory and `size` is the length of the requested block to check if memory is available.
    
2. **Free:**
   - `O(n)` in every case since all memory blocks are checked.

The above solutions iterate over the memory array which is efficient for moderate sizes (e.g., up to 1000). Higher efficiency could potentially be achieved using more advanced data structures like segment trees or balanced trees if required.
