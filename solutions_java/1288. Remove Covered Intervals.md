[Leetcode 1288. Remove Covered Intervals](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1288)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of intervals, where each interval is represented by a pair of integers `[start, end]`. A pair `[a, b]` is said to cover another pair `[c, d]` if and only if `a <= c` and `b >= d`. Your task is to find the number of intervals that are not covered by any other interval in the list.

**Example:**
```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[3,6],[2,8]]
Output: 2
Explanation: Interval [3,6] is covered by [2,8], but [1,4] and [2,8] are not covered by any other interval.
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= intervals.length <= 1000`
- `intervals[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= start < end <= 10^5`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format**: The input is a list of intervals where each interval is given as a list of two integers `[start, end]`.
2. **Output Format**: The output should be a single integer representing the number of intervals that are not covered by any other interval.
3. **Sorting**: Should we sort the intervals first? - Yes, we should sort them by their start times. If start times are the same, sort by end times in descending order to handle overlapping cases efficiently.
4. **Handling of Edge Cases**: We should consider any corner cases like all intervals being identical or all intervals having different ranges with no overlaps.

### Strategy

1. **Sorting Intervals**:
   - First, sort the intervals by the start time. If two intervals have the same start time, sort them by the end time in descending order. This sorting helps in efficiently identifying covered intervals as we can assume the longer interval with the same start time comes first.

2. **Tracking the End**:
   - Initialize a variable to track the maximum end of the intervals encountered so far. As we iterate through the sorted list of intervals, compare each interval's end with this maximum end:
     - If an interval's end time is less than or equal to the tracked maximum end time, it means it is covered by a previously processed interval.
     - If an interval's end time is greater than the tracked maximum end time, it is not covered by any previous interval, so increment the count of non-covered intervals and update the maximum end time.

3. **Counting Non-Covered Intervals**:
   - Maintain a counter for the non-covered intervals. Only increment this counter when you find an interval that is not covered by any previous interval.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int removeCoveredIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        // Sort intervals by start time. If equal, sort by end time in descending order
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> {
            if (a[0] == b[0]) {
                return b[1] - a[1];
            } else {
                return a[0] - b[0];
            }
        });

        int count = 0; // To count non-covered intervals
        int maxEnd = 0; // To keep track of the maximum end encountered

        for (int[] interval : intervals) {
            if (interval[1] > maxEnd) {
                count++;
                maxEnd = interval[1];
            }
        }

        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[][] intervals = { {1, 4}, {3, 6}, {2, 8} };
        System.out.println(sol.removeCoveredIntervals(intervals)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: The sorting step takes `O(n log n)` time where `n` is the number of intervals.
- **Iteration**: Iterating through the intervals to count the non-covered ones takes `O(n)` time.
- **Overall Complexity**: The algorithm's overall time complexity is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step. The additional `O(n)` for the iteration is negligible in comparison to the sorting.

This is an efficient and optimal approach for solving the problem.
