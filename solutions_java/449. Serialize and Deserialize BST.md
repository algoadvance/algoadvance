[Leetcode 449. Serialize and Deserialize BST](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l449)
### Problem Statement
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary search tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary search tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

**The encoded string should be as compact as possible.**

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What type of tree is it?**
   - It is a Binary Search Tree (BST).

2. **Can the tree have duplicate values?**
   - The problem does not mention duplicates, so we'll assume no duplicates in the node values.

3. **What should the structure of the serialized data be?**
   - There is no restriction on the format as long as it can be serialized and deserialized reliably.

4. **Are there any constraints on node values?**
   - Assume typical integer values for the nodes in the binary search tree.

### Strategy
To serialize the BST, we can use a pre-order traversal approach that allows us to capture the structure of the tree effectively. In pre-order traversal, we visit the root node first, followed by the left subtree, and then the right subtree. This traversal will help us capture the parent-child relationship directly, which is crucial for reconstructing the tree.

For deserialization, we can use the pre-order sequence, reconstructing the tree by recursively determining the bounds for the left and right subtrees.

### Code Implementation

```java
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public class Codec {

    // Encodes a tree to a single string.
    public String serialize(TreeNode root) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        serializeHelper(root, sb);
        return sb.toString();
    }
    
    private void serializeHelper(TreeNode root, StringBuilder sb) {
        if (root == null) {
            sb.append("null,");
            return;
        }
        sb.append(root.val).append(",");
        serializeHelper(root.left, sb);
        serializeHelper(root.right, sb);
    }

    // Decodes your encoded data to tree.
    public TreeNode deserialize(String data) {
        Queue<String> nodesQueue = new LinkedList<>(Arrays.asList(data.split(",")));
        return deserializeHelper(nodesQueue);
    }

    private TreeNode deserializeHelper(Queue<String> nodesQueue) {
        String value = nodesQueue.poll();
        if (value.equals("null")) {
            return null;
        }
        TreeNode node = new TreeNode(Integer.valueOf(value));
        node.left = deserializeHelper(nodesQueue);
        node.right = deserializeHelper(nodesQueue);
        return node;
    }

    // TreeNode class definition for the Binary Tree nodes
    public class TreeNode {
        int val;
        TreeNode left;
        TreeNode right;
        
        TreeNode() {}
        
        TreeNode(int val) {
            this.val = val;
        }
        
        TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
            this.val = val;
            this.left = left;
            this.right = right;
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Serialization:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the BST. Each node is visited once.
- **Deserialization:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the BST. Each node is reconstructed once.

This approach ensures that both serialization and deserialization are efficient and work within linear time complexity.
