[Leetcode 2829. Determine the Minimum Sum of a k](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2829)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integers `n` and `k`. An array is called `k-avoiding` if there is no pair of distinct elements in the array that adds up to `k`.

Return the minimum possible sum of a `k-avoiding` array of length `n`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What are the constraints on `n` and `k`? 
    - Are `n` and `k` guaranteed to be positive integers?

2. **Output Requirements:**
    - Do you need the actual array or only the sum of the elements?
    
3. **Pair Distinction:**
    - Are we considering pairs in any specific order, or simply the combination of any two different indices?

### Strategy

To satisfy the condition that no two distinct elements in the array sum up to `k`, we can use the following approach:

1. **Choosing Unique Elements:**
    - Start by using the first `n` natural numbers, i.e., `1, 2, 3, ..., n`. This ensures minimality.

2. **Ensuring No Pair Sums to `k`:**
    - As we build the array, avoid adding elements that would form a pair summing up to `k`.
    - If `i` (an element <= `k/2`) is part of the array, then `k - i` should not be part of the array to avoid a pair summing to `k`.

3. **Shifting Elements If Necessary:**
    - If any such `k - i` would conflict, select numbers beyond `n` to fill in such gaps.

### Code

```java
public class MinimumSumKAvoidingArray {
    public int minimumSum(int n, int k) {
        int sum = 0;
        int count = 0;
        boolean[] isUsed = new boolean[k + n + 1];  // To flag elements already used
        
        for (int i = 1; count < n; i++) {
            if (i < k && !isUsed[k - i]) {
                // Skip this number because it would form a pair with (k - i)
                continue;
            }
            sum += i;
            isUsed[i] = true;
            count++;
        }
        
        return sum;
    }

    // For quick testing
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumSumKAvoidingArray solution = new MinimumSumKAvoidingArray();
        System.out.println(solution.minimumSum(5, 4)); // Expected output: 15
        System.out.println(solution.minimumSum(2, 3)); // Expected output: 3
        System.out.println(solution.minimumSum(3, 5)); // Expected output: 6
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The primary operations of the algorithm involve iterating over a sequence and checking conditions to avoid certain pairs.

- **Looping through numbers:** The loop potentially needs to go up to `2n` to avoid using elements that collide.
- **Checking isUsed array:** Access to this boolean array is constant time.

Therefore, the time complexity of the above solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the size of the array we need to construct.

This efficient approach ensures that we avoid unwanted pairs while minimizing the sum of the array.
