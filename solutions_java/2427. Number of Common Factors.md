### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 2427: Number of Common Factors

Given two positive integers `a` and `b`, return the number of common factors of `a` and `b`.

A common factor of `a` and `b` is any integer that divides both `a` and `b` exactly (i.e., without leaving a remainder).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Are the integers `a` and `b` guaranteed to be positive?
   - What is the maximum value for `a` and `b`?

2. **Output**:
   - Should the function return the count of the common factors?

### Code

```java
public class CommonFactors {
    public int commonFactors(int a, int b) {
        int gcdValue = gcd(a, b);
        int commonFactorCount = 0;
        
        // Only need to check up to gcdValue since it is the highest possible common factor
        for (int i = 1; i <= gcdValue; i++) {
            if (a % i == 0 && b % i == 0) {
                commonFactorCount++;
            }
        }
        
        return commonFactorCount;
    }

    // Helper method to calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) using Euclidean algorithm
    private int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            return a;
        }
        return gcd(b, a % b);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CommonFactors solution = new CommonFactors();
        System.out.println(solution.commonFactors(12, 15)); // Output should be 2 (factors are 1 and 3)
        System.out.println(solution.commonFactors(100, 50)); // Output should be 6 (factors are 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50)
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Find the GCD**: Calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm.
2. **Count Common Factors**:
   - Iterate from 1 to the GCD value.
   - For each integer `i` in this range, check if it divides both `a` and `b` exactly.
   - Increment the count of common factors if `i` divides both `a` and `b`.

### Time Complexity

1. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The Euclidean algorithm has a time complexity of O(log(min(a, b))).

2. **Counting Factors**:
   - In the worst case, we iterate up to the GCD value, making this portion O(GCD(a, b)).

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(log(min(a, b)) + GCD(a, b)).

By leveraging the GCD, we limit the range of integers we need to check, making the solution efficient for large inputs.
