[Leetcode 2134. Minimum Swaps to Group All 1's Together II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2134)
### Problem Statement

Given a binary circular array `nums`, return the minimum number of swaps required to group all 1's present in the array together at any location.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the length of `nums`?**
   - Typically, constraints of the problem would provide this. Assuming a reasonable range (e.g., `1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10^5`).

2. **What is the structure of the circular array?**
   - The circular array means you can think of the array as wrapped around. The last element is adjacent to the first element.

3. **Do we need to handle any edge cases?**
   - If there are no 1's or only 1's in the array, edge cases should be considered.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, you can apply the following strategy:

1. **Count Total 1's:** First count the total number of 1's (`totalOnes`) in the array. This will help in determining the window size for the sliding window technique.
  
2. **Sliding Window Technique:** Use a sliding window of size `totalOnes` to find the minimum swaps needed to group all 1's together in a linear array.

3. **Circular Nature:** Since the array is circular, consider extending the array virtually by concatenating the array with itself. This allows straightforward calculation using the sliding window on the extended array.
  
4. **Calculate Zeroes:** Calculate the number of 0's in each window of size `totalOnes` because we need to swap these 0's to get all 1's together.

5. **Optimize Swaps:** Iterate over the possible windows and track the minimum number of swaps needed.

### Code

Here's the Java implementation of the described strategy:

```java
public class MinimumSwaps {
    public int minSwaps(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        
        // Step 1: Calculate the number of 1's in the array.
        int totalOnes = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            totalOnes += num;
        }
        
        // Edge case: If there are no 1's or all elements are 1's, zero swaps needed.
        if (totalOnes == 0 || totalOnes == n) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        // Step 2: Consider the array as circular by extending it.
        int[] extendedNums = new int[2 * n];
        System.arraycopy(nums, 0, extendedNums, 0, n);
        System.arraycopy(nums, 0, extendedNums, n, n);
        
        // Step 3: Sliding window over the extended array
        int minSwaps = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int currentOnes = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < totalOnes; i++) {
            currentOnes += extendedNums[i];
        }
        minSwaps = Math.min(minSwaps, totalOnes - currentOnes);
        
        for (int i = totalOnes; i < extendedNums.length; i++) {
            // Slide the window
            currentOnes += extendedNums[i] - extendedNums[i - totalOnes];
            minSwaps = Math.min(minSwaps, totalOnes - currentOnes);
        }
        
        return minSwaps;
    }

    // Main Function to test the code
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumSwaps solution = new MinimumSwaps();
        int[] nums1 = {0,1,0,1,1,0,0};
        int[] nums2 = {1,1,0,0,1};
        System.out.println(solution.minSwaps(nums1));  // Output: 1
        System.out.println(solution.minSwaps(nums2));  // Output: 0
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is \(O(n)\):

- Counting the total number of 1's takes \(O(n)\).
- Extending the array and the sliding window operations both operate within \(O(n)\).

The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) due to the extended array created for simulating the circular behavior.
