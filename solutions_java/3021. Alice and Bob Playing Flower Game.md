[Leetcode 3021. Alice and Bob Playing Flower Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3021)
### Problem Statement

Alice and Bob are playing a game with some flowers. Alice loves red flowers and hates blue flowers. Bob loves blue flowers and hates red flowers.

They are given a string, `s`, where each character represents a flower. 'R' means red flower, and 'B' means blue flower. They take turns to pick flowers from either end of the string. Alice always goes first. Each player tries to maximize the score difference from their opponent (Alice tries to maximize `A - B` and Bob tries to maximize `B - A`, where `A` is Alice's score and `B` is Bob's score).

The score difference is calculated based on the number of flowers they love minus the number of flowers they hate each player picks.

Write a function to return the score difference when both players play optimally.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Should I assume the input string contains only 'R' and 'B' characters?
2. What is the length range of the input string `s`?
3. Should the result be the score difference (Alice - Bob) after all flowers have been picked?

### Strategy

1. Use a dynamic programming solution to keep track of optimal moves for both players.
2. Define `dp[i][j]` as the maximum score difference from the segment `s[i:j+1]` when the game starts from that segment.
3. Initialize the base cases when `i == j` (single flower) for Aliceâ€™s turn.
4. Use recursion or iterative dynamic programming to fill in the `dp` table by considering both players' moves.
5. Consider both players picking flowers from either end of the current segment and calculating the result accordingly.
6. Return `dp[0][s.length-1]`, which gives the maximum score difference starting from the complete segment.

### Code

```java
public class FlowerGame {

    public int flowerGameScore(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[n][n];
        
        // Initialize base case where the segment is of length 1.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i][i] = s.charAt(i) == 'R' ? 1 : -1; // Alice's score difference for a single flower
        }

        // Fill the dp table for larger segments
        for (int length = 2; length <= n; length++) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - length; i++) {
                int j = i + length - 1;
                // Alice picks s[i] or s[j]
                // If Alice picks s[i], the score difference is affected by her hate/love for the flower and Bob's next optimal move
                int pickLeft = (s.charAt(i) == 'R' ? 1 : -1) - dp[i + 1][j];
                // If Alice picks s[j], similar considerations apply
                int pickRight = (s.charAt(j) == 'R' ? 1 : -1) - dp[i][j - 1];
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(pickLeft, pickRight);
            }
        }

        // The best score difference starting from the whole segment
        return dp[0][n - 1];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FlowerGame fg = new FlowerGame();
        System.out.println(fg.flowerGameScore("RRBB")); // Example usage
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is O(n^2) because we are filling an `n x n` DP table.
- The space complexity is O(n^2) due to the storage for the DP table.

This approach efficiently calculates the score difference when both Alice and Bob play optimally.
