[Leetcode 2027. Minimum Moves to Convert String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2027)
## Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. You are allowed to convert any segment of 3 consecutive characters 'x' to 'O'. You need to return the minimum number of moves required to convert all the 'x' characters in the string to 'O'.

- For example, if `s = "xxoxxox"`, you can convert the first 3 characters ("xxo") and the last 3 characters ("xox") independently, resulting in "OooOooox".

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can segments overlap when converting 'x' to 'O'?
   **A:** No, segments can't overlap. Each segment of 3 consecutive 'x's should be independent and non-overlapping.

2. **Q:** Do we need to handle any uppercase characters or non-alphabetic characters?
   **A:** No, the problem guarantees that the string consists of lowercase English letters only.

3. **Q:** What is the expected length range of the input string `s`?
   **A:** Assuming typical LeetCode constraints, length of `s` is from 1 to \(10^5\).

## Strategy
1. Traverse the string `s` while maintaining a current index `i`.
2. Whenever an 'x' is found at the current index `i`, increase the counter for moves and skip the next 3 characters (i.e., set `i` to `i + 3`).
3. If the current index is not 'x', simply move to the next character (i.e., increment `i` by 1).

## Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int minimumMoves(String s) {
        int moves = 0;
        int i = 0;
        
        while (i < s.length()) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == 'x') {
                moves++;
                i += 3;
            } else {
                i++;
            }
        }
        
        return moves;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.minimumMoves("xxoxxox")); // Output: 3
        System.out.println(sol.minimumMoves("oxxxxo"));  // Output: 2
        System.out.println(sol.minimumMoves("ooo"));     // Output: 0
        System.out.println(sol.minimumMoves("xxxxx"));   // Output: 2
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- The algorithm traverses the string `s` exactly once, so the time complexity is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the string.
- This ensures efficient processing even for the upper constraint limit of `10^5` characters.

Feel free to test the implementation with different test cases or edge cases to ensure it covers all scenarios.
