[Leetcode 218. The Skyline Problem](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l218)
### Problem Statement

The Skyline Problem involves finding the skyline formed by a collection of rectangular buildings in a cityscape. Given a list of buildings where each building is represented as a triplet: \([left, right, height]\), your task is to output the skyline formed by these buildings. The skyline is represented as a list of "key points" in the format \([x, height]\) where \(x\) represents a horizontal position and \(height\) is the height of the building at that horizontal position.

### Example

**Input:** 
\[
[[2, 9, 10], [3, 7, 15], [5, 12, 12], [15, 20, 10], [19, 24, 8]]
\]

**Output:** 
\[
[[2, 10], [3, 15], [7, 12], [12, 0], [15, 10], [20, 8], [24, 0]]
\]

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are the buildings guaranteed to be non-overlapping in terms of horizontal coordinates?
   - **A:** No, buildings can overlap.

2. **Q:** Are the buildings sorted by their left coordinate in the input?
   - **A:** No, the buildings are not guaranteed to be sorted.

3. **Q:** Can the heights of buildings be zero?
   - **A:** Typically, buildings have positive heights, but for practical purposes, let's assume all heights are positive.

4. **Q:** Can the skyline contain floating-point coordinates?
   - **A:** No, both coordinates will be integers.

### Strategy

To solve the Skyline Problem efficiently, we can use a sweep line algorithm with a priority queue (max heap). The plan can be outlined as follows:

1. **Transform the buildings into events:** Each building generates two events: a start event and an end event.
2. **Sort the events:** Sort these events by their horizontal position \(x\). If two events have the same \(x\), prioritize start events over end events, and if both are start events or end events, the taller building first.
3. **Process the events using a max heap:** Use a max heap to keep track of the current active buildings (sorted by height). When processing a start event, add it to the heap. When processing an end event, remove it from the heap.
4. **Generate the skyline key points:** For each event, if the maximum height in the heap changes, output a new key point \([x, max\_height]\).

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public List<int[]> getSkyline(int[][] buildings) {
        List<int[]> result = new ArrayList<>();
        List<int[]> height = new ArrayList<>();

        // Transform buildings into height events
        for (int[] b : buildings) {
            height.add(new int[]{b[0], -b[2]}); // start event
            height.add(new int[]{b[1], b[2]});  // end event
        }

        // Sort the height events
        Collections.sort(height, (a, b) -> {
            if (a[0] != b[0])
                return a[0] - b[0];
            return a[1] - b[1];
        });

        // Max heap to keep the heights
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b - a);
        pq.offer(0);
        int prevMax = 0;

        // Process all the events
        for (int[] h : height) {
            if (h[1] < 0) {
                pq.offer(-h[1]);
            } else {
                pq.remove(h[1]);
            }

            int currMax = pq.peek();
            if (currMax != prevMax) {
                result.add(new int[]{h[0], currMax});
                prevMax = currMax;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting Events:** We have \(2n\) events for \(n\) buildings. Sorting these events takes \(O(2n \log 2n)\), which simplifies to \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Processing Events:** Each event is processed in \(O(\log n)\) time due to the priority queue operations, leading to a total of \(O(2n \log n)\) for processing events.

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).
