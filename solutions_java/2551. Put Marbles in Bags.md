[Leetcode 2551. Put Marbles in Bags](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2551)
### Problem Statement

You are given `n` marbles, all being of the same weight. Your task is to split these marbles into `k` separate bags in the way that each bag contains at least one marble. Write a function to compute the possible ways to split the marbles into these bags.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on `n` and `k`:**
   - Are `n` (number of marbles) and `k` (number of bags) positive integers?
   - Is `k` always less than or equal to `n`?

2. **Boundary Conditions:**
   - What should be returned if `n` is less than `k` as it's impossible to put marbles in bags under such conditions?

   Based on a typical problem of this nature, it can be presumed that `n` and `k` are always positive integers and `k ≤ n`.

### Strategy

This problem is a classic combinatorial problem that can be translated into “stars and bars” theorem in combinatorics. The theorem states that there are `C(n-1, k-1)` ways to split `n` identical items into `k` groups, where `C` represents the binomial coefficient.

#### Formula: 
\[ \text{Number of ways} = C(n-1, k-1) \]
Where:
- \( C(n, k) \) is the combination formula \[ \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!} \]

### Code

```java
import java.math.BigInteger;

public class MarbleSplitter {

    public static int splitMarbles(int n, int k) {
        // The critical condition where n < k should return 0 as no way to split
        if (n < k) return 0;

        // Use combinations formula C(n-1, k-1)
        return binomialCoeff(n - 1, k - 1).intValue();
    }

    private static BigInteger binomialCoeff(int n, int k) {
        BigInteger result = BigInteger.ONE;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            result = result.multiply(BigInteger.valueOf(n - i));
            result = result.divide(BigInteger.valueOf(i + 1));
        }
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Example cases to validate the solution
        System.out.println(splitMarbles(10, 2)); // Should return 9
        System.out.println(splitMarbles(10, 3)); // Should return 36
        System.out.println(splitMarbles(10, 10)); // Should return 1
        System.out.println(splitMarbles(5, 6)); // Should return 0
        // Additional tests
        System.out.println(splitMarbles(100, 50)); // Check for performance and correctness
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(k)\). The loop iterates `k` times for calculating the binomial coefficient.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\). We use a fixed amount of space, aside from the space required for the BigInteger calculations.

This method efficiently computes the number of ways to distribute marbles into bags using combinatorial logic. It leverages the properties of binomial coefficients, which are mathematical concepts well-suited for problems of this nature.
