[Leetcode 2581. Count Number of Possible Root Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2581)
### Problem Statement

You are given a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph with no cycles) consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and exactly `n - 1` edges. Each node has a value associated with it that you can retrieve with tree nodes array `vals`. 

You are also given an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree.

Additionally, each node has a frequency which is stored in an array `frequency`.

You need to count the number of nodes that can be the root of the subtree such that the root has the highest frequency among all its subtree nodes. 

Return this count.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all node values unique?**
   - No, node values are not provided. We only care about the frequency of each node.

2. **What are the constraints on `n` and the values in the `frequency` array?**
   - Generally, `1 <= n <= 10^5` and `1 <= frequency[i] <= 10^5`.

3. **Is there a guarantee that the tree is well-formed (i.e., exactly `n-1` edges for `n` nodes)?**
   - Yes, it is guaranteed to be a valid tree.

4. **Will there be duplicate frequency values across different nodes?**
   - Yes, it is possible for multiple nodes to have the same frequency.

### Strategy

1. **Tree Representation**:
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the tree.
   
2. **Subtree Frequency Calculation**:
   - Use depth-first search (DFS) from all nodes to calculate the frequency of nodes in the subtree rooted at each node.
   
3. **Determine Valid Root Nodes**:
   - While performing the DFS, check if the current root has the highest frequency among all nodes in its subtree.

4. **Count Possible Roots**:
   - Count all nodes where the root node frequency is the highest in its subtree.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    private Map<Integer, List<Integer>> tree;
    private int[] frequency;
    private int[] subtreeFrequency;
    private Set<Integer> possibleRoots;
    
    public int countHighestFrequencyRoots(int n, int[][] edges, int[] frequency) {
        this.tree = new HashMap<>();
        this.frequency = frequency;
        this.subtreeFrequency = new int[n];
        this.possibleRoots = new HashSet<>();
        
        // Step 1: Build the tree
        buildTree(edges, n);
        
        // Step 2: Initialize possibleRoots
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            possibleRoots.add(i);
        }
        
        // Step 3: DFS from an arbitrary node to calculate subtree frequencies
        dfs(0, -1);
        
        // At the end, size of possibleRoots will be our answer
        return possibleRoots.size();
    }
    
    private void buildTree(int[][] edges, int n) {
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            tree.put(i, new ArrayList<>());
        }
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            tree.get(edge[0]).add(edge[1]);
            tree.get(edge[1]).add(edge[0]);
        }
    }
    
    private void dfs(int node, int parent) {
        subtreeFrequency[node] = frequency[node];
        for (int neighbor : tree.get(node)) {
            if (neighbor == parent) continue;
            dfs(neighbor, node);
            subtreeFrequency[node] += subtreeFrequency[neighbor];
        }
        
        // Check if the node can be a root
        for (int neighbor : tree.get(node)) {
            if (neighbor == parent) continue;
            if (subtreeFrequency[neighbor] >= subtreeFrequency[node]) {
                possibleRoots.remove(node);
                return;
            }
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int n = 5;
        int[][] edges = { {0, 1}, {0, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4} };
        int[] frequency = { 3, 2, 1, 10, 1 };
        System.out.println(sol.countHighestFrequencyRoots(n, edges, frequency));  // Example use
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Tree Construction**: O(n)
- **DFS Traversal**: O(n) (Each node is visited once)
- **Overall**: O(n)

This solution is efficient enough given the constraints. Each node and edge are processed a constant number of times.
