[Leetcode 1721. Swapping Nodes in a Linked List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1721)
### Problem Statement

You are given the head of a linked list, and an integer `k`.

Return the head of the linked list after **swapping the values** of the `kth` node from the beginning and the `kth` node from the end (the list is **1-indexed**).

**Example:**
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], k = 2
Output: [1,4,3,2,5]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Will `k` always be valid?**
   - Yes, `k` will always be a valid integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ n where n is the number of nodes in the list.
   
2. **Does swapping involve changing the nodes themselves or just their values?**
   - The problem specifically asks to swap the values of the nodes, not the nodes themselves.

3. **Can the linked list have duplicate values?**
   - Yes, the linked list can have duplicate values.

### Strategy

1. **Find the Length of the List:**
   - Traverse the entire list to determine its length `n`.

2. **Identify the Nodes to Swap:**
   - Traverse again to identify the `k`th node from the beginning and `k`th node from the end.
   - Note that the `k`th node from the end is the `(n - k + 1)`th from the beginning.

3. **Swap the Values Only:**
   - Swap the values of the `k`th node from the beginning and the `k`th node from the end.

4. **Return the Modified List:**
   - Return the head of the modified linked list.

### Code

Here is the implementation of the strategy in Java:

```java
public class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode() {}
    ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
    ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
}

public class Solution {
    public ListNode swapNodes(ListNode head, int k) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) return head;

        ListNode lengthNode = head;
        int length = 0;
        // Calculate the length of the linked list.
        while (lengthNode != null) {
            length++;
            lengthNode = lengthNode.next;
        }

        // Find the k-th node from the start.
        ListNode firstK = head;
        for (int i = 1; i < k; i++) {
            firstK = firstK.next;
        }

        // Find the k-th node from the end.
        ListNode secondK = head;
        int endPosition = length - k + 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < endPosition; i++) {
            secondK = secondK.next;
        }

        // Swap the values of the two k-th nodes.
        int temp = firstK.val;
        firstK.val = secondK.val;
        secondK.val = temp;

        return head;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **O(n):** The algorithm runs in linear time. 
  - The first pass through the list to determine its length takes `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list.
  - The second and third passes (to find the nodes to swap) each take `O(n)` in the worst case.
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.
