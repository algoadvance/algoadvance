[Leetcode 2045. Second Minimum Time to Reach Destination](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2045)
### Problem Statement

You are given an undirected weighted connected graph containing `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, and an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [u_i, v_i, time_i]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `u_i` and `v_i` that takes `time_i` seconds to traverse. You are also given two integers `change` and `num_doors`.

**Define:**
- `change`: A green light period followed by a red light period. The traffic lights alternate between green and red every `change` seconds.
- `num_doors`: The number of doors to pass through.

Your task is to find the second minimum time to reach node `n` from node `1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Clarifications on the traffic lights cycle:**  
   - Does the light alternate between green and red at the start of every multiple of `change` seconds?

2. **Multiple paths and doors:**  
   - Are there multiple doors, and must you traverse specific doors, or do multiple paths include different doors?

3. **Graph properties:**
   - Are there any guarantees on the structure of the input, such as connectedness?
   - Can there be multiple edges between two nodes with different weights?

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we must find two distinct paths from node `1` to node `n` and compute their travel times considering the traffic light changes.

1. **Dijkstra-like Algorithm:** 
   - We'll employ a modified Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest and second shortest paths from node `1` to node `n`.
   - Maintain a priority queue to explore the paths in increasing order of time.
   - Use a `dist` array to keep minimal travel times to each node and maintain the two smallestâ€”`first_min` and `second_min`.

2. **Traffic Light Adjustment:** 
   - Whenever an edge is traversed, calculate the time it takes to pass through, taking into account the current time and whether it hits a red light period.

### Code Implementation

```java
import java.util.*;

public class SecondMinimumTimeToReachDestination {
    public int secondMinimum(int n, int[][] edges, int time, int change) {
        // Adjacency list for undirected graph
        List<List<int[]>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0], v = edge[1], t = edge[2];
            graph.get(u).add(new int[] {v, t});
            graph.get(v).add(new int[] {u, t});
        }

        // Priority queue to hold the state of (current_time, node, path_count)
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        pq.offer(new int[] {0, 1, 0}); // (time, node, stop count)

        // To store the two shortest times to each node
        int[][] dist = new int[n + 1][2];
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            Arrays.fill(dist[i], Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        }
        dist[1][0] = 0;

        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            int[] current = pq.poll();
            int curTime = current[0], node = current[1], count = current[2];

            for (int[] neighbor : graph.get(node)) {
                int nextNode = neighbor[0];
                int travelTime = neighbor[1];
                int newTime = curTime + travelTime;

                // Check traffic light
                if ((curTime / change) % 2 == 1) {
                    newTime += (change - (curTime % change));
                }

                if (dist[nextNode][0] > newTime) {
                    dist[nextNode][1] = dist[nextNode][0];
                    dist[nextNode][0] = newTime;
                    pq.offer(new int[] {newTime, nextNode, count + 1});
                } else if (dist[nextNode][0] < newTime && dist[nextNode][1] > newTime) {
                    dist[nextNode][1] = newTime;
                    pq.offer(new int[] {newTime, nextNode, count + 1});
                }
            }
        }

        return dist[n][1] == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : dist[n][1];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SecondMinimumTimeToReachDestination solution = new SecondMinimumTimeToReachDestination();
        int n = 5;
        int[][] edges = // use example above
        int time = 2;
        int change = 5;
        System.out.println(solution.secondMinimum(n, edges, time, change));  // Expected Output: Second Minimum Time
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Graph Construction:** \(O(E)\)
- **Main Algorithm:** 
  - Insertion and extraction from the priority queue for each of the edges, implying complexity of \(O((E + V) \log V)\).
- **Overall:** \(O((E + V) \log V)\), where \(E\) is the number of edges and \(V\) is the number of vertices.
