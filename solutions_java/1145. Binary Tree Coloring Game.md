[Leetcode 1145. Binary Tree Coloring Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1145)
### Problem Statement
LeetCode Problem 1145: Binary Tree Coloring Game

Two players play a game on a binary tree. Player 1 starts by coloring the root of the tree red. Then players alternate turns. In each turn, a player selects a node of their color (red if Player 1, blue if Player 2) and colors an uncolored neighbor (parent or child) of the selected node.

If a player cannot legally color a node in their turn, they lose, and the other player wins.

Given the root of the binary tree and the number of nodes `n` in the tree, and the value `x` which is initially colored by Player 1, return `true` if Player 2 can win the game, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the tree guaranteed to be a binary tree?**
   - Yes, the problem states it is a binary tree.
2. **Will Player 2 always start on the first move after Player 1?**
   - Yes, Player 2 goes after Player 1 has picked the initial node.
3. **Are the node values unique?**
   - Yes, node values are unique.

### Strategy
1. **Understanding Player 2's strategy:**
   - Player 2 wins if they can claim more than half of the nodes after Player 1's initial turn.
   
2. **Key Observations:**
   - After Player 1 picks node `x`, the tree can be split into three subtrees:
     1. The left subtree of `x`.
     2. The right subtree of `x`.
     3. The rest of the tree excluding `x` and its direct children.
     
3. **Step-by-step Approach:**
   - Calculate the size of the left subtree of node `x`.
   - Calculate the size of the right subtree of node `x`.
   - Determine the size of the rest of the tree.
   - If any of these three parts has more than `n/2` nodes, Player 2 can win.

### Code

```java
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

public class Solution {
    int leftSize, rightSize;
    
    public boolean btreeGameWinningMove(TreeNode root, int n, int x) {
        calculateSizes(root, x);
        int parentSize = n - (leftSize + rightSize + 1); // The size of the remaining tree excluding node x and its children
        
        // Player 2 can win if any part has more than half the nodes
        int half = n / 2;
        return leftSize > half || rightSize > half || parentSize > half;
    }
    
    private int calculateSizes(TreeNode node, int x) {
        if (node == null) return 0;
        int left = calculateSizes(node.left, x);
        int right = calculateSizes(node.right, x);
        if (node.val == x) {
            leftSize = left;
            rightSize = right;
        }
        return left + right + 1;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of the solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we traverse the entire tree once to determine the sizes of the subtrees.
- The space complexity is **O(h)**, where `h` is the height of the binary tree due to the recursive call stack.

This solution ensures efficiency and correctness by leveraging a single pass traversal to compute the subtree sizes needed to determine the winning strategy for Player 2.
