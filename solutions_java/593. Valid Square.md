[Leetcode 593. Valid Square](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l593)
### Problem Statement

Given the coordinates of four points in 2D space, determine if the four points can construct a square.

The input is four points in the format (x, y). You need to write a function:

```java
public boolean validSquare(int[] p1, int[] p2, int[] p3, int[] p4)
```

where `p1`, `p2`, `p3`, and `p4` are arrays representing the coordinates of the points.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Do all points need to be distinct?**
   - Yes, for a valid square, all four points need to be distinct.

2. **What if the points form a degenerate square (all points coinciding)?**
   - No, if all points coincide, it isn't considered a square.

3. **What range of values can the coordinates of the points take?**
   - The coordinates can be any valid integer values within the range of typical integer limits in Java.

### Strategy
1. **Calculate Distance:**
   - Compute the squared distances between all pairs of points.
   - Squared distances are used instead of actual distances to avoid floating-point inaccuracies.

2. **Sort and Validate:**
   - There should be exactly four smaller distances (the sides of the square) and two larger, equal distances (the diagonals).
   - Specifically: the four sides should be the same and the two diagonals should be the same and larger than the sides.

3. **Check the Properties:**
   - Verify the uniqueness of points.
   - Verify the correct number of unique distances.

### Code

Here is the Java code implementing the above approach:

```java
public class ValidSquare {
    public boolean validSquare(int[] p1, int[] p2, int[] p3, int[] p4) {
        int[] distances = {
            distanceSquared(p1, p2), distanceSquared(p1, p3),
            distanceSquared(p1, p4), distanceSquared(p2, p3),
            distanceSquared(p2, p4), distanceSquared(p3, p4)
        };
        
        Arrays.sort(distances);
        
        // Check that we have 4 sides (equal smaller lengths) and 2 diagonals (equal larger lengths)
        return distances[0] > 0 &&
               distances[0] == distances[1] &&
               distances[0] == distances[2] &&
               distances[0] == distances[3] &&
               distances[4] == distances[5] &&
               distances[4] > distances[3];
    }
    
    private int distanceSquared(int[] a, int[] b) {
        return (a[0] - b[0]) * (a[0] - b[0]) + (a[1] - b[1]) * (a[1] - b[1]);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Distance Calculation:**
  - Calculating the squared distance for 6 pairs of points: \(O(1)\)

- **Sorting:**
  - Sorting the 6 distances: \(O(6 \log 6)\) which is effectively \(O(1)\) given the constant number of elements.

This algorithm runs in constant time \(O(1)\) since it neither depends on input size (always 4 points) nor complex operations beyond fixed-distance computations and fixed-size sorting.
