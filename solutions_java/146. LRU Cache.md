[Leetcode 146. LRU Cache](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l146)
## Problem Statement
Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.

Implement the `LRUCache` class:
- `LRUCache(int capacity)` Initializes the LRU cache with positive size `capacity`.
- `int get(int key)` Returns the value of the `key` if the `key` exists, otherwise returns `-1`.
- `void put(int key, int value)` Updates the value of the `key` if the `key` exists. Otherwise, adds the `key-value` pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the `capacity` from this operation, evict the least recently used key.

The functions `get` and `put` must each run in O(1) average time complexity.

Example:
```
Input:
["LRUCache","put","put","get","put","get","put","get","get","get"]
[[2],[1,1],[2,2],[1],[3,3],[2],[4,4],[1],[3],[4]]

Output:
[null,null,null,1,null,-1,null,-1,3,4]

Explanation:
LRUCache lRUCache = new LRUCache(2);
lRUCache.put(1, 1); // cache is {1=1}
lRUCache.put(2, 2); // cache is {1=1, 2=2}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return 1
                    // cache is {2=2, 1=1}
lRUCache.put(3, 3); // LRU key was 2, evicts key 2, cache is {1=1, 3=3}
lRUCache.get(2);    // returns -1 (not found)
lRUCache.put(4, 4); // LRU key was 1, evicts key 1, cache is {3=3, 4=4}
lRUCache.get(1);    // return -1 (not found)
lRUCache.get(3);    // return 3
lRUCache.get(4);    // return 4
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What should the behavior be if we put a key that exists already?**
   - It should update the value and move this key to the most recently used position.

2. **What should the behavior be if we get a key that does not exist?**
   - It should return `-1`.

3. **Is the capacity always a positive integer?**
   - Yes, the capacity is always a positive integer.

## Strategy
To achieve O(1) time complexity for both `get` and `put` operations, we can use a combination of:
1. A `HashMap` to store key-value pairs for O(1) access.
2. A doubly linked list to keep track of the order of usage (most recently used to least recently used).

- The `HashMap` will map keys to the corresponding node in the doubly linked list.
- The doubly linked list will be used to maintain the usage order. The front of the list will represent the most recently used item, and the back will represent the least recently used item.

### Key Operations:
1. **get(key)**:
   - Check if the key is in the `HashMap`.
   - If found, move this node to the front of the doubly linked list and return the value.
   - If not found, return `-1`.

2. **put(key, value)**:
   - If the key already exists, update the value and move the node to the front of the list.
   - If the key does not exist:
     - Check if the cache size exceeds the capacity.
     - If it does, remove the node at the back of the doubly linked list and delete its entry from the `HashMap`.
     - Insert the new key-value pair into the front of the doubly linked list and add it to the `HashMap`.

## Code
```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class LRUCache {
    private class Node {
        int key;
        int value;
        Node prev;
        Node next;
        Node(int key, int value) {
            this.key = key;
            this.value = value;
        }
    }

    private final int capacity;
    private final HashMap<Integer, Node> map;
    private final Node head;
    private final Node tail;

    public LRUCache(int capacity) {
        this.capacity = capacity;
        this.map = new HashMap<>();
        this.head = new Node(0, 0);
        this.tail = new Node(0, 0);
        head.next = tail;
        tail.prev = head;
    }

    public int get(int key) {
        if (!map.containsKey(key)) return -1;
        Node node = map.get(key);
        remove(node);
        insertToFront(node);
        return node.value;
    }

    public void put(int key, int value) {
        if (map.containsKey(key)) {
            Node node = map.get(key);
            node.value = value;
            remove(node);
            insertToFront(node);
        } else {
            if (map.size() == capacity) {
                map.remove(tail.prev.key);
                remove(tail.prev);
            }
            Node newNode = new Node(key, value);
            map.put(key, newNode);
            insertToFront(newNode);
        }
    }

    private void remove(Node node) {
        node.prev.next = node.next;
        node.next.prev = node.prev;
    }

    private void insertToFront(Node node) {
        Node temp = head.next;
        head.next = node;
        node.prev = head;
        node.next = temp;
        temp.prev = node;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **get(key)**: O(1)
- **put(key, value)**: O(1)
Both operations are achieved in constant time due to the efficient use of the `HashMap` and the doubly linked list.
