[Leetcode 1366. Rank Teams by Votes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1366)
### Problem Statement
In a voting system, you are given an array of strings `votes` where each string represents a voter's ranking of teams. Teams are denoted by uppercase English letters and strings are of the same length. You need to determine the final ranking of the teams based on these votes.

The ranking is determined as follows:
1. Compare the votes for each team position starting from the first, then the second, and so on.
2. If two teams are tied in all positions, they should be ranked lexicographically.

For example:
- Input: `votes = ["ABC", "ACB", "ABC", "ACB", "ACB"]`
- Output: `"ACB"`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the length of the votes array and maximum length of each string?**
   Typically, constraints should be manageable for competitive coding environments.
2. **What should we return if there are no votes?**
   This situation is unlikely due to problem constraints but could be specified to return an empty string.

### Strategy
1. Initialize a `Map<Character, int[]>` to store each team's voting positions.
2. For each vote, update each team's position count.
3. Create a list from the keys (teams) of the map.
4. Define a custom comparator to sort the teams:
   - First, compare by highest vote positions.
   - If tied, then compare lexicographically.
5. Convert the sorted list to a string for the final answer.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class RankTeamsByVotes {

    public String rankTeams(String[] votes) {
        if (votes == null || votes.length == 0) {
            return "";
        }

        // Map to store team ranking count
        Map<Character, int[]> rankMap = new HashMap<>();

        // Initialize map with all teams and their position counts
        for (char team : votes[0].toCharArray()) {
            rankMap.put(team, new int[votes[0].length()]);
        }

        // Fill rankMap with votes count for each position
        for (String vote : votes) {
            for (int i = 0; i < vote.length(); i++) {
                rankMap.get(vote.charAt(i))[i]++;
            }
        }

        // Create a list of teams
        List<Character> teams = new ArrayList<>(rankMap.keySet());

        // Sort the teams based on the ranking criteria
        Collections.sort(teams, (a, b) -> {
            for (int i = 0; i < votes[0].length(); i++) {
                if (rankMap.get(a)[i] != rankMap.get(b)[i]) {
                    return rankMap.get(b)[i] - rankMap.get(a)[i];
                }
            }
            return a - b;
        });

        // Build the output string
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        for (char team : teams) {
            result.append(team);
        }

        return result.toString();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        RankTeamsByVotes solution = new RankTeamsByVotes();
        System.out.println(solution.rankTeams(new String[] {"ABC", "ACB", "ABC", "ACB", "ACB"}));  // Output: "ACB"
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization of the map: O(N * M)** where N is the number of votes and M is the length of each vote string.
- **Filling the rank map: O(N * M)** as each vote is processed.
- **Sorting the teams: O(T * log T * M)** where T is the number of unique teams, T could be up to 26.
- **Overall:** The complexity is dominated by sorting, making it **O(T * log T * M)**.

### Additional Notes
1. **Space Complexity:** It's primarily the space used by the rank map, which is **O(26 * M)** in the worst case where 26 comes from the English alphabet size.
2. **Edge Cases:** Handle if `votes` contain only one string or if all votes place the same ranking. Ensure function works with the least and most complex inputs within constraints.
