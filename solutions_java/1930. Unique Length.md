[Leetcode 1930. Unique Length](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1930)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. A subsequence is a string that can be derived from another string by deleting some or no characters without changing the order of the remaining characters.

A **palindromic subsequence** is a subsequence that reads the same forward and backward.

A **unique palindromic subsequence** is a palindromic subsequence that appears only once in the string.

Given a string `s`, you need to find the number of unique palindromic subsequences of length 3 in the string `s`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the input only lowercase English letters?**
   - Yes, the input will only consist of lowercase English letters.
   
2. **Is the length of the string constrained within certain limits?**
   - The typical constraint will be `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`.
   
3. **What do we do if the input string has less than 3 characters?**
   - If the input string has fewer than 3 characters, then the answer is 0, as we cannot form a length-3 palindromic subsequence.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate over all unique characters**: We will iterate over all unique characters and count how many unique length-3 palindromic subsequences can be formed with each character as the first and last character.
2. **Use two arrays to keep track of counts**:
   - `left_count`: This will track the count of each character seen so far as we iterate through the string.
   - `right_count`: This will track the count of each character remaining in the string.
3. **Update and Check**: For each character in the string, update the `right_count` and check how many times each unique character appears in the substring that lies between the first and last occurrence of the character.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int countPalindromicSubsequence(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[][] right_count = new int[n][26];

        // Fill right_count array
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (i < n - 1) {
                for (int k = 0; k < 26; k++){
                    right_count[i][k] = right_count[i + 1][k];
                }
            }
            right_count[i][s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;
        }

        int[][] left_count = new int[n][26];
        Set<String> unique_palindromes = new HashSet<>();

        // Iterate to calculate left_count and check for palindromes
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (i > 0) {
                for (int k = 0; k < 26; k++) {
                    left_count[i][k] = left_count[i - 1][k];
                }
            }
            left_count[i][s.charAt(i) - 'a']++;

            int charIndex = s.charAt(i) - 'a';
            if (left_count[i][charIndex] >= 2) {
                int leftPos = left_count[i][charIndex] - 1;
                if (leftPos > 0 && right_count[i][charIndex] >= 2) {
                    for (int ch = 0; ch < 26; ch++) {
                        if (left_count[leftPos - 1][ch] > 0 && right_count[i + 1][ch] > 0) {
                            unique_palindromes.add("" + (char)('a' + charIndex) + (char)('a' + ch) + (char)('a' + charIndex));
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return unique_palindromes.size();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();

        System.out.println(solution.countPalindromicSubsequence("aabca")); // Output: 3 ("aba", "aca", "bcb")
        System.out.println(solution.countPalindromicSubsequence("adc"));   // Output: 0
        System.out.println(solution.countPalindromicSubsequence("bbcbaba")); // Output: 4 ("bcb", "bab", "aba", "aca")
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. The nested loops and array initialization are linear in nature due to fixed array lengths of 26 (number of lowercase English letters).
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), primarily due to the additional space used by the `right_count` and `left_count` arrays. Additionally, the `unique_palindromes` set contributes to the space complexity based on the number of unique palindromic subsequences found.
