[Leetcode 741. Cherry Pickup](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l741)
### Problem Statement

The problem "741. Cherry Pickup" can be described as follows:

You are given an `n x n` grid representing a field of cherries, where each cell is one of the following:
- 0 represents an empty cell,
- 1 represents a cell containing a cherry,
- -1 represents a cell containing a thorn that blocks access to the cell.

You have two players starting at the top-left corner of the grid and need to collect as many cherries as possible. Both players start from the cell `(0, 0)` and move towards the cell `(n-1, n-1)`, following these possible movements: right (`(0, 1)`) or down (`(1, 0)`). They both must end at the destination cell `(n-1, n-1)`.

After reaching the destination `(n-1, n-1)`, both should return to the starting point `(0, 0)`, again collecting as many cherries as possible in any of the directions permitted.

The goal is to return the maximum number of cherries that can be collected by both players by the time they both start from `(0, 0)` and then return to `(0, 0)`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Question:** What happens if both players traverse through the same cell?
   **Answer:** If both players traverse the same cell, the cherries in that cell should only be collected once.

2. **Question:** Is it guaranteed that there exists at least one valid path?
   **Answer:** No, it is not guaranteed. If no valid path exists, the result should be 0.

3. **Question:** How do the players avoid the `-1` cells representing thorns?
   **Answer:** The players cannot move onto or through cells containing `-1`.

### Code

```java
public class CherryPickup {
    public int cherryPickup(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        Integer[][][] dp = new Integer[n][n][n];
        int result = Math.max(0, dpSolve(grid, dp, 0, 0, 0));
        return result;
    }

    private int dpSolve(int[][] grid, Integer[][][] dp, int r1, int c1, int r2) {
        int c2 = r1 + c1 - r2;
        int n = grid.length;

        // Bounds check
        if (r1 >= n || c1 >= n || r2 >= n || c2 >= n ||
            grid[r1][c1] == -1 || grid[r2][c2] == -1) {
            return Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        }

        if (r1 == n-1 && c1 == n-1) {
            return grid[r1][c1];
        }

        if (dp[r1][c1][r2] != null) {
            return dp[r1][c1][r2];
        }

        int cherryCount = grid[r1][c1];
        if (r1 != r2) {
            cherryCount += grid[r2][c2];
        }

        int temp = Math.max(
            Math.max(dpSolve(grid, dp, r1 + 1, c1, r2 + 1),
                     dpSolve(grid, dp, r1, c1 + 1, r2 + 1)),
            Math.max(dpSolve(grid, dp, r1 + 1, c1, r2),
                     dpSolve(grid, dp, r1, c1 + 1, r2))
        );

        cherryCount += temp;
        dp[r1][c1][r2] = cherryCount;
        return cherryCount;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CherryPickup cp = new CherryPickup();
        int[][] grid = {
            {0, 1, -1},
            {1, 0, -1},
            {1, 1,  1}
        };
        System.out.println(cp.cherryPickup(grid)); // Answer should be 5
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming State Definition:**  
   Use a 3D DP array `dp[r1][c1][r2]` which represents the maximum cherries collected if one player is at `(r1, c1)` and the other player is at `(r2, c2)`, where `c2` can be derived as `r1 + c1 - r2`.

2. **Base Condition:**  
   If either player is out of bounds, or if they encounter a thorn (`-1`), return a very low negative value (`Integer.MIN_VALUE`) to denote invalid paths.

3. **Recursive Relation:**  
   From each state `(r1, c1, r2)`, both players can either go down or to the right:
   - `(r1+1, c1, r2+1)`,
   - `(r1, c1+1, r2+1)`,
   - `(r1+1, c1, r2)`,
   - `(r1, c1+1, r2)`.

4. **Combining Results:**  
   Collect cherries from both current positions `grid[r1][c1]` and `grid[r2][c2]`, ensuring not to count cherries twice if both players are on the same cell.

5. **Memoization:**  
   Use the `dp` array to memoize results and avoid recomputation, thus optimizing the solution.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is `O(n^3)` where `n` is the dimension of the grid. This is because each state `(r1, c1, r2)` has `n^3` possible states, and each state transitions into a constant number of other states.

The space complexity is also `O(n^3)` due to the memoization 3D array used to store intermediate results.
