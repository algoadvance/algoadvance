[Leetcode 1764. Form Array by Concatenating Subarrays of Another Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1764)
### Problem Statement

Given a 2D array `groups` and an integer array `nums`.

A 2D array is formed by concatenating the subarrays of `groups` successively in the given order.

- For example, if `groups = [[1,2,3],[3,4]]`, then you can concatenate them to form `[1,2,3,3,4]`.

However, you are not allowed to reorder the subarrays of `groups` or concatenate a subarray of `groups` in a different order.

Return `true` if you can chose some `subarrays` from `nums` and concatenate them in a manner that forms the array formed by concatenating `groups`, or `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the subarrays overlap in `nums`?
   - No, subarrays chosen from `nums` must not overlap.
2. Are the elements in the subarrays guaranteed to be unique?
   - No, elements in `groups` and `nums` can be repeated.
3. What is the maximum length of `groups` and `nums`?
   - The length of `groups` and `nums` can go up to 10^4.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Initialize an index `i` to 0 to iterate over `nums`.

2. **Iterate over `groups`**: For each subarray in `groups`, we try to find its starting position in `nums` starting from index `i`.

3. **Find Subarray**: Check if the current subarray in `groups` matches a subarray in `nums` starting from `i`. If found, move `i` to the index right after the end of this subarray in `nums`.

4. **Invalid Match**: If at any point the subarray cannot be found, return `false`.

5. **Successful Match**: If all subarrays in `groups` are successfully matched in sequence as subarrays in `nums`, return `true`.

### Code

```java
public boolean canChoose(int[][] groups, int[] nums) {
    int i = 0; // Pointer for `nums`
    for (int[] group : groups) {
        boolean found = false;
        while (i + group.length <= nums.length) {
            boolean match = true;
            for (int j = 0; j < group.length; j++) {
                if (nums[i + j] != group[j]) {
                    match = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (match) {
                found = true;
                i += group.length; // Move pointer past this subarray
                break;
            }
            i++;
        }
        if (!found) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: O(1)
- **Outer Loop (Iterate over groups)**: O(g) where g is the number of subarrays in `groups`.
- **Inner Loop (Find Subarray)**: For each subarray, in the worst case, we might have to iterate over the entire remaining portion of `nums`.

- Let's denote:
  - `g` as the number of subarrays in `groups`.
  - `n` as the length of `nums`.
  - `k` as the average length of subarrays in `groups`.

- **Total Complexity**: In the worst case, it can be O(g * n), because for each subarray, we might iterate through the entire remaining part of `nums`.

However, this worst case is rare and the average complexity should be much better due to early breaks in the inner loop when matches are found.
