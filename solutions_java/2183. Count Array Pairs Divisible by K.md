[Leetcode 2183. Count Array Pairs Divisible by K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2183)
Sure! Let's tackle the problem step by step. 

### Problem Statement
Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n` and an integer `k`, return the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that:
- `0 <= i < j < n`
- `nums[i] * nums[j]` is divisible by `k`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of the values in `nums`**: Are the values in the array positive or can they be negative as well?
2. **Range of `k`**: Can `k` be zero or negative, or is it guaranteed to be a positive integer?
3. **Size constraints**: What is the maximum length `n` of the array `nums`?
4. **Time complexity expectations**: Do we have a constraint on the expected time complexity? This may influence whether a brute force solution is acceptable or if we need a more optimal approach.

Let me answer these questions with reasonable assumptions if the problem description does not provide these details in a real interview scenario:
1. Assume values in `nums` are non-negative integers.
2. Assume `k` is a positive integer.
3. Assume `n` can be up to \(10^5\) (a common constraint in coding problems).
4. Given the constraint on `n`, aim to have an average-case complexity better than \(O(n^2)\).

### Strategy
1. **Brute-force approach**: Iterate over all pairs `(i, j)` and check if `nums[i] * nums[j]` is divisible by `k`. This requires \(O(n^2)\) time complexity, which might be too slow for large values of `n`.
   
2. **Optimized approach**:
   - Use a hash map or array to keep track of the counts of values modulo `k`.
   - Iterate through the numbers and, for each number `nums[i]`, determine its modulo `k` value. Use these counts to determine the number of valid pairs that can be formed with the current element.

### Code Implementation
Hereâ€™s a more efficient implementation using the optimized approach:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public long countPairs(int[] nums, int k) {
        // A map to store the frequency of gcd values.
        Map<Integer, Integer> gcdFreq = new HashMap<>();
        long count = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            int gcd1 = gcd(num, k);  // Compute gcd of num and k.
            
            // Go through the hashmap entries to count valid pairs.
            for (int gcd2 : gcdFreq.keySet()) {
                if ((long)gcd1 * gcd2 % k == 0) {  // Check if nums[i] * nums[j] is divisible by k
                    count += gcdFreq.get(gcd2);
                }
            }
            
            // Update the frequency of the current gcd.
            gcdFreq.put(gcd1, gcdFreq.getOrDefault(gcd1, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        return count;
    }
    
    // Helper function to compute GCD using Euclidean algorithm.
    private int gcd(int a, int b) {
        while (b != 0) {
            int temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }
}

```

### Time Complexity
- **Preprocessing step (GCD calculation)**: Each `gcd` operation runs in \(O(\log(\min(num, k)))\).
- **Total complexity**: For each element in `nums`, we are iterating through the keys of the `gcdFreq` which, in the worst case, can be up to the order of `nums`. However, the common keys would likely keep this in a manageable number closer to \(O(n)\) with additional logarithmic factors from GCD calculations.

The time complexity of the approach is roughly \(O(n \log k)\), which should be efficient enough for the problem's constraints.
