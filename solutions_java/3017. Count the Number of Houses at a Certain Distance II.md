[Leetcode 3017. Count the Number of Houses at a Certain Distance II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3017)
## Problem Statement

Let's say we have a city represented as a 2D grid of size \(m \times n\). Each cell in the grid can be one of three types:
- 0 representing an empty plot,
- 1 representing a house,
- 2 representing a facility.

Given a list of coordinates of houses and facilities in the city, the goal is to determine the number of houses that are exactly `d` distance away from the nearest facility. The distance between two cells \((x1, y1)\) and \((x2, y2)\) is defined as the Manhattan distance \( |x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2| \).

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Grid Bounds:** What are the possible sizes of the grid (m, n)?
2. **Facility Count:** Can there be multiple facilities in the city grid?
3. **House and Facility Coordinates:** Are the coordinates provided of houses and facilities, or do we need to identify them from the grid?
4. **Distance Constraint:** Does the distance exactly have to be `d` or at most `d`?

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:

1. **Parse the Input:**
   - Read the grid and identify houses and facilities.
2. **Calculate Distances:**
   - For each house, calculate its Manhattan distance to every facility.
   - Keep track of the minimum distance for each house.
3. **Count Houses:**
   - Count the number of houses where the minimum Manhattan distance to a facility is exactly `d`.

**Algorithm:**

1. Read the city grid and store coordinates of all houses and facilities.
2. For each house, iterate through each facility and calculate the Manhattan distance.
3. Determine the minimum Manhattan distance for each house.
4. Count the number of houses where this minimum distance equals `d`.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class HouseFacilityDistance {
    public int countHousesAtDistance(int[][] grid, int distance) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        
        List<int[]> houses = new ArrayList<>();
        List<int[]> facilities = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Step 1: Identify the coordinates of houses and facilities
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    houses.add(new int[]{i, j});
                } else if (grid[i][j] == 2) {
                    facilities.add(new int[]{i, j});
                }
            }
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        
        // Step 2: Calculate the minimum distance from each house to any facility
        for (int[] house : houses) {
            int minDist = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            for (int[] facility : facilities) {
                int dist = Math.abs(house[0] - facility[0]) + Math.abs(house[1] - facility[1]);
                minDist = Math.min(minDist, dist);
            }
            // Step 3: Check if this minimum distance equals the given distance
            if (minDist == distance) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        HouseFacilityDistance obj = new HouseFacilityDistance();
        int[][] grid = {
            {0, 2, 0},
            {0, 1, 0},
            {0, 1, 1}
        };
        int distance = 2;
        System.out.println(obj.countHousesAtDistance(grid, distance));  // Output should be 2
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Identifying houses and facilities:** \(O(m \times n)\)
- **Calculating distances:** For each house (H), we iterate through each facility (F). So the complexity is \(O(H \times F)\). In the worst case, this is also \(O(m \times n \times m \times n)\).
  
Given the nested iterations to find minimum distances, the overall complexity is \(O(H \times F)\), which can be simplified to \(O((m \times n) \times (m \times n))\) in the worst case.

- **Space Complexity:** We are using lists to store coordinates of houses and facilities, leading to \(O(H + F)\) auxiliary space.
