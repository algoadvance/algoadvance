[Leetcode 3044. Most Frequent Prime](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3044)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, return the most frequent **prime number** that occurs. If there is a tie, return the smallest number among them. If there is no prime number, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the elements in the `nums` array?**
   Generally, array elements can go up to quite high values. Is there any specific range or limit we should consider for optimal prime number checking?
   
2. **What is the size of the `nums` array?**
   Knowing if the array can be very large helps in choosing the right algorithm for both finding primes and processing the array.

3. **Can `nums` contain negative numbers?**
   Prime numbers are defined for positive integers greater than 1, so it's important to confirm whether the array will have only positive numbers or we have to deal with negative numbers and zero as well.

### Strategy
1. **Identify Primes:**
   Use the Sieve of Eratosthenes to find all primes up to the maximum number in the `nums` array. This is efficient and will quickly provide all prime numbers up to `max(nums)`.

2. **Count Frequencies:**
   Use a HashMap to count the occurrences of each prime number in the array.

3. **Determine the Most Frequent Prime:**
   Iterate through the HashMap to find the prime number with the highest frequency. In case of a tie, choose the smallest prime number.

### Code
Here's the implementation of the above strategy:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class PrimeFrequency {
    
    // Helper function to implement Sieve of Eratosthenes
    public static boolean[] sieveOfEratosthenes(int max) {
        boolean[] isPrime = new boolean[max + 1];
        for (int i = 2; i <= max; i++) {
            isPrime[i] = true;
        }
        for (int i = 2; i * i <= max; i++) {
            if (isPrime[i]) {
                for (int j = i * i; j <= max; j += i) {
                    isPrime[j] = false;
                }
            }
        }
        return isPrime;
    }
    
    public static int mostFrequentPrime(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        // Find the maximum value in nums
        int max = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num > max) {
                max = num;
            }
        }
        
        // Find all primes up to the maximum value
        boolean[] isPrime = sieveOfEratosthenes(max);
        
        // Count the frequency of prime numbers in nums
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num > 1 && isPrime[num]) {
                frequencyMap.put(num, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
            }
        }
        
        // Find the most frequent prime number
        int mostFrequentPrime = -1;
        int highestFrequency = 0;
        
        for (int prime : frequencyMap.keySet()) {
            int frequency = frequencyMap.get(prime);
            if (frequency > highestFrequency || (frequency == highestFrequency && prime < mostFrequentPrime)) {
                highestFrequency = frequency;
                mostFrequentPrime = prime;
            }
        }
        
        return mostFrequentPrime;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {3, 5, 3, 1, 5, 5, 7, 8, 7, 3};
        System.out.println(mostFrequentPrime(nums));  // Output: 3
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sieve of Eratosthenes:** O(n log(log n)), where n is the maximum number in the nums array.
- **Frequency Counting:** O(m), where m is the number of elements in the nums array.
- **Overall:** The overall time complexity is O(max(n, m)), which is efficient for large input sizes if the numbers in the array are not exceedingly large.

The provided solution efficiently finds the most frequent prime in the array, handling edge cases and ties properly.
