[Leetcode 2526. Find Consecutive Integers from a Data Stream](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2526)
### Problem Statement

You are given a data stream of integers. Design a class that checks if there are any k consecutive integers with the same value in the data stream.

Implement the `DataStream` class:

- `DataStream(int k)` Initializes the object with the integer `k`, the number of consecutive integers that must have the same value.
- `boolean consec(int num)` Adds `num` to the stream of integers and returns `true` if there are at least `k` consecutive integers with the same value, and `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of the input numbers in the data stream?
   - What is the range of `k`?
   
   *Assumption: The input numbers can be any integer (positive or negative). `k` is a positive integer.*

2. **Behavior of Sequences:**
   - Does the sequence end upon finding the required consecutive integers, or does it continue to search within an unlimited data stream?
   
   *Assumption: The stream continues indefinitely and checks each input continuously.*

3. **Internals of the Class:**
   - Should the class maintain the entire stream history or only the necessary parameters to check the condition?
   
   *Assumption: Only maintain necessary parameters to perform the check, aiming for memory efficiency.*

### Strategy

- **Initialize:** Keep track of `k` and use a counter to check consecutive occurrences.
- **Internal State:** Maintain the current number and its count.
- **Logic:** Upon each call to `consec`, update the current number. If the consecutive count of the number reaches `k`, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Code

```java
class DataStream {
    private int k;
    private int currentNum;
    private int count;

    public DataStream(int k) {
        this.k = k;
        this.currentNum = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        this.count = 0;
    }

    public boolean consec(int num) {
        if (num == currentNum) {
            count++;
        } else {
            currentNum = num;
            count = 1;
        }
        return count >= k;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Constructor (`DataStream(int k)`):**
   - Initializes the `k` to check for `k` consecutive integers.
   - Initializes `currentNum` to a value that is unlikely to appear in the stream initially.
   - Sets `count` to 0.

2. **Method (`boolean consec(int num)`):**
   - Checks if the incoming `num` matches the `currentNum`.
     - If it does, increments the `count`.
     - If it doesn't, updates `currentNum` to `num` and resets `count` to 1.
   - Returns `true` if `count` is at least `k`, otherwise, returns `false`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(1)
  - Each call to `consec` performs a constant-time operation.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - Only a fixed amount of space is used to store the current number and its count, regardless of the size of the stream.
