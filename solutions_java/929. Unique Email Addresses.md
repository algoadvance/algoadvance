[Leetcode 929. Unique Email Addresses](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l929)
### Problem Statement
You are given a list of emails. Each email contains a local name and a domain name, separated by the '@' sign. 

For example, in `alice@leetcode.com`, `alice` is the local name and `leetcode.com` is the domain name.

Besides lowercase letters, these emails may contain `'.'`s or `'+'`s. If you add periods (`'.'`) between some characters in the local name part of an email address, it will not change the email address. For example, `alice.z@leetcode.com` and `alicez@leetcode.com` are the same email address.

If you add a plus (`'+'`) in the local name, it will ignore everything after the first plus sign. This allows certain emails to be filtered. For example, `m.y+n.a.m.e+filter@leetcode.com` will be sent to `my@leetcode.com`.

This means that both `alice.z@leetcode.com` and `alicez@leetcode.com` will be considered the same, as will `m.y+n.a.m.e+filter@leetcode.com` and `my@leetcode.com`.

Your task is to count the number of unique email addresses from a given list of emails.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input:** Can the input be empty or null? (Assume no empty or null inputs for simplicity)
2. **Output:** Should the output be the number of unique emails?
3. **Characters:** Are emails case-sensitive? (Emails are in lowercase)
4. **Constraints:** Will the email addresses always be valid and properly formatted?

### Strategy
1. **Initialization:** Create a `Set` to hold the processed email addresses.
2. **Processing:**
   - Split each email into local and domain parts on '@'.
   - For the local part:
     - Ignore all characters after '+'.
     - Remove all periods (`'.'`).
   - Combine the processed local part with the domain part.
   - Add the resulting string to the set (ensuring uniqueness).
3. **Output:** The size of the set is the number of unique email addresses.

### Code
```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class UniqueEmailAddresses {
    public int numUniqueEmails(String[] emails) {
        Set<String> uniqueEmails = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (String email : emails) {
            String[] parts = email.split("@");
            String local = parts[0];
            String domain = parts[1];
            
            // Ignore everything after '+' in the local part
            if (local.contains("+")) {
                local = local.substring(0, local.indexOf('+'));
            }
            
            // Remove all periods from the local part
            local = local.replace(".", "");
            
            // Combine the cleaned local part with the domain
            String cleanedEmail = local + "@" + domain;
            
            // Add the cleaned email to the set
            uniqueEmails.add(cleanedEmail);
        }
        
        // The size of the set is the number of unique email addresses
        return uniqueEmails.size();
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        UniqueEmailAddresses solution = new UniqueEmailAddresses();
        String[] emails = {
            "test.email+alex@leetcode.com",
            "test.e.mail+bob.cathy@leetcode.com",
            "testemail+david@lee.tcode.com"
        };
        
        System.out.println(solution.numUniqueEmails(emails)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **O(n \* m):** Where `n` is the number of emails and `m` is the average length of an email. This is because each email is processed individually with a loop through `split`, `replace`, and other string operations.

This solution ensures that we efficiently filter and count the number of unique email addresses by leveraging string manipulation and a set to enforce uniqueness.
