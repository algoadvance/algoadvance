[Leetcode 3070. Count Submatrices with Top](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3070)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D matrix of integers and a target integer `k`. Your task is to count the number of submatrices such that the sum of the elements in each submatrix is less than `k` and each submatrix starts at the top-left corner of the original matrix.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Matrix constraints**: What are the constraints on the dimensions of the matrix (e.g., maximum number of rows and columns)?
2. **Element constraints**: What are the constraints on the elements of the matrix (e.g., maximum and minimum values)?
3. **Value of `k`**: What are the constraints on `k`?
4. **Type of Submatrices**: Should the submatrices strictly start from the top-left corner (i.e., index [0][0])?

Assuming the matrix size can be significant, an efficient algorithm is required.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we'll use a two-dimensional prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of any submatrix starting at the top-left corner (0,0). Here are the steps:

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**:
    - Create a prefix sum matrix `prefixSum` where `prefixSum[i][j]` stores the sum of elements from `matrix[0][0]` to `matrix[i][j]`.
  
2. **Submatrix Sum Calculation**:
    - For each possible bottom-right corner `(i, j)`, compute the sum of the submatrix from `(0, 0)` to `(i, j)` using the prefix sum array.
  
3. **Count Valid Submatrices**:
    - Check if the sum is less than `k` and count the submatrix if it satisfies the condition.

### Code

Here is the Java implementation of the above strategy:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int countSubmatrices(int[][] matrix, int k) {
        int m = matrix.length;
        int n = matrix[0].length;

        // Step 1: Compute prefix sums
        int[][] prefixSum = new int[m][n];

        // Fill the prefix sum array
        prefixSum[0][0] = matrix[0][0];
        for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) {
            prefixSum[i][0] = prefixSum[i - 1][0] + matrix[i][0];
        }
        for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
            prefixSum[0][j] = prefixSum[0][j - 1] + matrix[0][j];
        }
        for (int i = 1; i < m; ++i) {
            for (int j = 1; j < n; ++j) {
                prefixSum[i][j] = prefixSum[i - 1][j] + prefixSum[i][j - 1] - 
                                  prefixSum[i - 1][j - 1] + matrix[i][j];
            }
        }

        // Step 2: Count the valid submatrices
        int count = 0;
        for (int r1 = 0; r1 < m; ++r1) {
            for (int c1 = 0; c1 < n; ++c1) {
                for (int r2 = r1; r2 < m; ++r2) {
                    for (int c2 = c1; c2 < n; ++c2) {
                        int subMatrixSum = prefixSum[r2][c2];
                        if (r1 > 0) subMatrixSum -= prefixSum[r1 - 1][c2];
                        if (c1 > 0) subMatrixSum -= prefixSum[r2][c1 - 1];
                        if (r1 > 0 && c1 > 0) subMatrixSum += prefixSum[r1 - 1][c1 - 1];

                        if (subMatrixSum < k) {
                            count++;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[][] matrix = {
            {1, 1, 1},
            {1, 1, 1},
            {1, 1, 1}
        };
        int k = 4;
        System.out.println(sol.countSubmatrices(matrix, k)); // Expected output: Number of valid submatrices
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this approach involves:
1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: \(O(m \times n)\)
2. **Submatrix Sum Calculation and Counting**:
   - The nested loops iterate over all possible submatrices.
   - This results in \(O(m^2 \times n^2) \) complexity.

Thus, overall, the time complexity is \(O(m \times n + m^2 \times n^2) \).

If the dimensions of the matrix are large, this approach might run into performance issues. Further optimizations would be necessary to handle larger inputs efficiently.
