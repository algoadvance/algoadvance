[Leetcode 219. Contains Duplicate II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l219)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return `true` if there are two distinct indices `i` and `j` in the array such that `nums[i] == nums[j]` and `abs(i - j) <= k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: What should be returned if the array is empty or contains only one element?**
   - A: Return `false`, as there can't be any duplicate indices in such cases.

2. **Q: Can the values in `nums` be negative?**
   - A: Yes, the values in `nums` can be negative.

3. **Q: Can `k` be zero or negative?**
   - A: `k` is expected to be non-negative as per the problem constraints.

4. **Q: How large can the array `nums` be?**
   - A: The length of the array (`n`) can be up to 10^5.

5. **Q: What are the possible values for `k`?**
   - A: `k` can range from 0 to n-1, where n is the length of the array.

### Strategy

We will use a HashMap to keep track of the indices of the elements as we iterate through the array. For each element, we will check if it has appeared before and if the difference between the current index and the last seen index is less than or equal to `k`. If such a pair is found, we return `true`. If we finish iterating through the array without finding such a pair, we return `false`.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public boolean containsNearbyDuplicate(int[] nums, int k) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
            return false;
        }
        
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (map.containsKey(nums[i])) {
                int prevIndex = map.get(nums[i]);
                if (i - prevIndex <= k) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
            map.put(nums[i], i);
        }
        
        return false;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        // Test cases
        System.out.println(sol.containsNearbyDuplicate(new int[]{1, 2, 3, 1}, 3)); // true
        System.out.println(sol.containsNearbyDuplicate(new int[]{1, 0, 1, 1}, 1)); // true
        System.out.println(sol.containsNearbyDuplicate(new int[]{1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3}, 2)); // false
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the array. We iterate through the array once, and each operation (check and update the map) is O(1).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), in the worst case, all elements may be unique and stored in the map.
