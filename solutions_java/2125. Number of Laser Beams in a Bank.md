[Leetcode 2125. Number of Laser Beams in a Bank](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2125)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D binary grid `bank` representing the layout of the bank. '1' represents a security device and '0' represents an empty space. A laser beam can be formed between two security devices if they are present in the same row and there are no other devices in between them.

You need to determine the total number of laser beams in the bank. Specifically, a laser beam can only be formed between two '1's such that:
1. They are in the same row.
2. There is no '1' in between the two '1's.

Return the total number of laser beams in the bank.

**Example:**
```
Input: 
bank = ["011001","000000","010100","001000"]

Output:
8
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input/Output format:** Is the input guaranteed to be valid and well-formed?
   - Yes, the input will always be a valid 2D binary grid of strings where each string is of the same length.

2. **Constraints:** Are there any constraints on the size of the grid?
   - The grid will have at most 1000 rows and each row will contain at most 1000 elements.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Rows with only '0's or a single '1' should be handled.
   - Rows with '1's interrupted by '0's should be handled correctly.
   - If no laser beams can be formed, return `0`.

### Strategy

1. **Count '1's Per Row:**
   - Traverse each row of the grid and count the number of '1's in each row.

2. **Compute Laser Beams:**
   - Let \( prev\_devices \) be the number of '1's in the previous non-empty row.
   - Traverse the list of counts and for each non-zero count \( current\_devices \), calculate the beams as \( prev\_devices \times current\_devices \). Update \( prev\_devices \) to \( current\_devices \).

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int numberOfBeams(String[] bank) {
        int totalBeams = 0;
        int prevDevices = 0;

        for (String row : bank) {
            int currentDevices = countOnes(row);
            if (currentDevices > 0) {
                totalBeams += prevDevices * currentDevices;
                prevDevices = currentDevices;
            }
        }

        return totalBeams;
    }

    private int countOnes(String row) {
        int count = 0;
        for (char c : row.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '1') count++;
        }
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        String[] bank = {"011001","000000","010100","001000"};
        System.out.println(sol.numberOfBeams(bank)); // Output: 8
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Counting Ones:**
  - For each row, counting the '1's takes \( O(m) \) time where \( m \) is the number of columns. Since there are \( n \) rows, it will take \( O(n \times m) \).

- **Overall Time Complexity:**
  - The overall time complexity is \( O(n \times m) \), where \( n \) is the number of rows and \( m \) is the number of columns in the grid. This is efficient given the constraints.

### Conclusion

The provided solution ensures that all edge cases are covered and operates within the given constraints efficiently. The solution approach is straightforward: count the number of '1's per row and then use those counts to compute the possible laser beams.
