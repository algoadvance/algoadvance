[Leetcode 95. Unique Binary Search Trees II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l95)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, generate all structurally unique BST's (binary search trees) that store values 1 to `n`.

### Clarifying Questions

Before proceeding, let's clarify a few points to ensure we understand the problem requirements:

1. **Input Constraints**: What is the maximum value for `n`?
   - This typically helps in understanding if the solution needs to be highly optimized.
   
2. **Output Format**: How should the trees be represented in the output? Are they represented as TreeNode objects or some other structure?
   - Usually, problems like these expect a list of TreeNode objects, but it's always good to confirm.

Let's assume:
- The input `n` is an integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 8\), making it feasible to generate and return all unique BSTs.
- The trees should be represented as linked nodes in a TreeNode structure.

### TreeNode Class Definition (In case needed)

Let's assume the definition of TreeNode is as below (commonly used in LeetCode problems):

```java
public class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode() {}
    TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
    TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Recursion**: We'll use recursion to solve this problem. The idea is to consider each number from 1 to `n` as the root and recursively generate all possible left and right subtrees.

2. **Divide and Conquer**: When a number `i` is chosen as the root, the numbers from 1 to `i-1` form the left subtree, and the numbers from `i+1` to `n` form the right subtree. We'll recursively generate all unique subtrees for each possible root.

3. **Merging Trees**: For each possible left subtree and each possible right subtree, we create a new tree with the current number as the root.

4. **Base Case**: If `start > end`, return a list containing `null` (indicating no subtree).

### Code

Here's how to implement this in Java:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public static class TreeNode {
        int val;
        TreeNode left;
        TreeNode right;
        TreeNode() {}
        TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
        TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
            this.val = val;
            this.left = left;
            this.right = right;
        }
    }

    public List<TreeNode> generateTrees(int n) {
        if (n == 0) return new ArrayList<>();
        return generateTrees(1, n);
    }
    
    private List<TreeNode> generateTrees(int start, int end) {
        List<TreeNode> allTrees = new ArrayList<>();
        if (start > end) {
            allTrees.add(null);
            return allTrees;
        }
        
        for (int i = start; i <= end; i++) {
            List<TreeNode> leftTrees = generateTrees(start, i - 1);
            List<TreeNode> rightTrees = generateTrees(i + 1, end);
            
            for (TreeNode left : leftTrees) {
                for (TreeNode right : rightTrees) {
                    TreeNode currentTree = new TreeNode(i);
                    currentTree.left = left;
                    currentTree.right = right;
                    allTrees.add(currentTree);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return allTrees;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        List<TreeNode> result = solution.generateTrees(3);
        // Add code to print the result if needed
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

This problem has a catalan number growth rate because it involves generating all possible BSTs:

- The number of unique BSTs that can be created with `n` nodes is given by the nth Catalan number: \( C_n = \frac{1}{n+1} \binom{2n}{n} \).
- Therefore, the number of unique BST structures is exponential in terms of `n`.

So, the time complexity for generating all unique BSTs is \(O(C_n)\), which is the nth Catalan number.

### Conclusion

The solution utilizes recursive tree generation with divide and conquer methodology to generate all unique BSTs for a given number n. The resulting trees are returned as a list of TreeNode objects.
