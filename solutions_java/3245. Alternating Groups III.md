[Leetcode 3245. Alternating Groups III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3245)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers nums and a positive integer k, sort the array such that the values are arranged in alternating ascending and descending oder in groups of size k. If there are fewer than k elements left at any point, just use those elements. 

Example:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], k = 3
Output: [1,2,3,6,5,4,7,8,9]

Explanation:
The elements are divided into groups of k = 3:
- Group 1: [1,2,3] - sorted in ascending order.
- Group 2: [4,5,6] - sorted in descending order.
- Group 3: [7,8,9] - sorted in ascending order.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the input array guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   Yes, the input array will always have at least one element.

2. **What range can the values of nums take?**
   The values in nums can be any integers within a reasonable range of -10^9 to 10^9.

3. **Will the value of k always be a positive integer less than or equal to the length of nums?**
   Yes, k is always a positive integer and will be less than or equal to the length of nums.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate over the array in steps of k:**
   Use a loop to iterate through the array in chunks of size k.
   
2. **Determine the order for each chunk:**
   Use a flag to alternate between ascending and descending order for each k-sized chunk of the array.
   
3. **Sort the chunk accordingly:**
   Depending on the flag, sort the chunk in ascending or descending order and then place the sorted elements back into the original array.
   
4. **Handle the end case:**
   Ensure that if the remaining elements are fewer than k, they are handled properly.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class AlternatingGroupsSort {
    public static int[] alternateSort(int[] nums, int k) {
        boolean ascending = true;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i += k) {
            int end = Math.min(i + k, nums.length);
            if (ascending) {
                Arrays.sort(nums, i, end);
            } else {
                Arrays.sort(nums, i, end);
                reverse(nums, i, end - 1);
            }
            ascending = !ascending;
        }
        return nums;
    }

    private static void reverse(int[] nums, int start, int end) {
        while (start < end) {
            int temp = nums[start];
            nums[start] = nums[end];
            nums[end] = temp;
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9};
        int k = 3;
        int[] result = alternateSort(nums, k);
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(result));
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: Sorting each k-sized block takes O(k log k) time.
- **Iteration and Sorting**: We have to sort n/k blocks, so the total time complexity for sorting is O((n/k) * (k log k)) = O(n log k).
- **Reversing**: Reversing an array segment takes O(k) in the worst case.
- **Overall**: Since the sorting dominates, the overall time complexity of this approach is approximately O(n log k).

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is O(1) extra space since we are modifying the input array in place except for the temporary variables used for swapping.
