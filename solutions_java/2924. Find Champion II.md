[Leetcode 2924. Find Champion II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2924)
## Problem Statement

The problem "2924. Find Champion II-out" requires us to find the "Champion" of a given group of participants. Each participant's victory and defeat against the other participants are given in the form of a list of outcomes. The participant who emerges undefeated when compared with other participants is considered the "Champion". The result should be the 1-based index of that participant.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input and Output Format**: 
    - Is the input in the form of an adjacency matrix, where element `outcomes[i][j]` indicates the result of participant `i` against participant `j`?
    - Should we return the 1-based index of the participant who meets the criteria?

2. **Constraints**:
    - What is the maximum number of participants?
    - Can there be any cases with no clear winner or multiple winners? How should we handle such cases?
    - Are self-comparisons (i.e., `i == j`) always marked in a certain way (e.g., -1 or some other flag)?

3. **Tie-breaking**: 
    - If two participants have the same comparison results, how do you determine who is the champion?

Assumptions based on standard problem constraints:
- Let's assume the number of participants is `n`.
- `outcomes[i][j] == 1` means participant `i` defeated participant `j`.
- `outcomes[i][j] == 0` means participant `i` lost to participant `j`.
- `outcomes[i][j] == -1` implies an invalid comparison (like `i == j`).

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Create an array to track each participant's win count.
2. **Tracking Wins**: Iterate through the `outcomes` matrix and update the win count based on each comparison.
3. **Identifying the Champion**: The participant with the highest win count will be identified as the "Champion".

## Code

```java
public class ChampionFinder {
    
    public int findChampion(int[][] outcomes) {
        int n = outcomes.length;
        
        // An array to count wins for each participant
        int[] winCount = new int[n];
        
        // Iterate through the outcomes to count wins for each participant
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (outcomes[i][j] == 1) {
                    winCount[i]++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Find the participant with the maximum wins
        int championIndex = -1;
        int maxWins = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (winCount[i] > maxWins) {
                maxWins = winCount[i];
                championIndex = i;
            }
        }
        
        // Return the 1-based index of the champion
        return championIndex + 1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ChampionFinder finder = new ChampionFinder();
        int[][] outcomes = {
            {-1, 1, 0},
            {0, -1, 1},
            {1, 0, -1}
        };
        int result = finder.findChampion(outcomes);
        System.out.println("Champion index: " + result); // Expected output is based on the outcomes array
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above algorithm is as follows:
- **Initialization and Counting Wins**: This process involves iterating through the entire `outcomes` matrix, which takes O(n^2) time where `n` is the number of participants.
- **Finding the Maximum**: Once we have the win counts, finding the participant with the maximum wins takes O(n) time.

Overall, the time complexity is O(n^2) due to the matrix traversal. This is efficient enough for reasonably large groups of participants.
