[Leetcode 2448. Minimum Cost to Make Array Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2448)
## Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays `nums` and `cost` each of length `n`. You can choose any integer x and change all elements of the array `nums` to `x`. The cost of changing an element `nums[i]` to `x` is `cost[i] * abs(nums[i] - x)`.

Return the minimum cost to make all elements of the array `nums` equal.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints:** What are the constraints on the size of the arrays and the value of the elements?
   - Length of the arrays (`n`): $1 \leq n \leq 10^5$
   - Values of elements in `nums` and `cost`: $1 \leq nums[i], cost[i] \leq 10^6$
   
2. **Inputs:** Are the arrays guaranteed to have the same length, and are they guaranteed to be non-empty?
   - Yes, both arrays are of the same length and are non-empty as per the constraints mentioned.

3. **Outputs:** What should be the output?
   - The output should be an integer representing the minimum cost to make all elements in `nums` equal.

## Strategy

The key challenge in this problem is to determine the optimal target value `x` to minimize the cost. Hereâ€™s a structured plan:

1. **Weighted Median Approach:** 
    - Considering the cost as weights, the optimal target value (x) will be the weighted median of the array `nums`. This is because the median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations.

2. **Implementation Steps:**
    - Pair the values in `nums` with the corresponding values in `cost`.
    - Sort these pairs based on `nums`.
    - Compute the cumulative weights and find the weighted median.
    - Calculate the total cost of converting all elements in `nums` to the weighted median.

**Steps in Detail:**

1. **Pair and Sort:**
    - Pair each element in `nums` with its corresponding cost and sort the pairs by the `nums` values.

2. **Compute Weighted Median:**
    - Aggregate the weights (costs) to find the weighted median. The weighted median is the point where the cumulative weight exceeds half the total weight.

3. **Calculate Cost:**
    - Once the weighted median is identified, calculate the total transformation cost using this median.

## Code

Here is the Java solution to implement this strategy:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MinimumCostArrayEqual {
    public static long minCost(int[] nums, int[] cost) {
        int n = nums.length;
        long totalCost = 0;
        
        // Pair the nums and cost together
        int[][] pairs = new int[n][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            pairs[i][0] = nums[i];
            pairs[i][1] = cost[i];
        }

        // Sort based on the nums value
        Arrays.sort(pairs, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));

        // Find the weighted median
        long totalWeight = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            totalWeight += pairs[i][1];
        }

        long accumulatedWeight = 0;
        int weightedMedian = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            accumulatedWeight += pairs[i][1];
            if (accumulatedWeight >= (totalWeight + 1) / 2) {
                weightedMedian = pairs[i][0];
                break;
            }
        }

        // Calculate the minimum cost using the weighted median
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            totalCost += 1L * cost[i] * Math.abs(nums[i] - weightedMedian);
        }

        return totalCost;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {1, 3, 5, 2};
        int[] cost = {2, 3, 1, 14};
        System.out.println(minCost(nums, cost)); // Output will vary depending on input
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting the pairs:** `O(n log n)`
- **Finding the weighted median:** `O(n)`
- **Calculating the total cost:** `O(n)`

Hence, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)** due to the sorting step.
