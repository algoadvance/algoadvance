[Leetcode 88. Merge Sorted Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l88)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers `m` and `n`, representing the number of elements in `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively.

Merge `nums1` and `nums2` into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array `nums1`. To accommodate this, `nums1` has a length of `m + n`, where the first `m` elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last `n` elements are set to `0` and should be ignored.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is it guaranteed that the input arrays `nums1` and `nums2` are already sorted?**
   - Yes, both `nums1` (first `m` elements) and `nums2` are sorted in non-decreasing order.

2. **Can the elements in `nums1` be negative?**
   - Yes, the elements can be negative as it is not mentioned that the elements are strictly positive.

3. **Should the merged elements fit within the initial length of `nums1`?**
   - Yes, the merged array should replace the elements in `nums1` without exceeding its length.

### Strategy

1. **Two-Pointer Approach**: Use two pointers (`p1` for `nums1` and `p2` for `nums2`) and start comparing from the end of both arrays. This ensures that we utilize the empty spaces at the end of `nums1` effectively.
2. **Merge in Reverse Order**:
   - Start from the back of `nums1` and fill in elements from the end to the beginning.
   - Compare the elements that `p1` and `p2` points to and place the larger element at the current end position.
   - Move the pointer accordingly and reduce the index `p` where the next element is to be placed.
3. **Edge Case**: If elements remain in `nums2` after `p1` is exhausted, copy them directly into the starting positions in `nums1`.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public void merge(int[] nums1, int m, int[] nums2, int n) {
        // Pointers
        int p1 = m - 1; // pointer for nums1
        int p2 = n - 1; // pointer for nums2
        int p = m + n - 1; // pointer for merged array
        
        // Merge in reverse order
        while (p1 >= 0 && p2 >= 0) {
            if (nums1[p1] > nums2[p2]) {
                nums1[p] = nums1[p1];
                p1--;
            } else {
                nums1[p] = nums2[p2];
                p2--;
            }
            p--;
        }
        
        // If there are remaining elements in nums2
        while (p2 >= 0) {
            nums1[p] = nums2[p2];
            p2--;
            p--;
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(m + n)
  - We process each element of `nums1` and `nums2` exactly once in a single pass, thus it's O(m + n).

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The algorithm does not utilize any extra space proportional to the input size; we modify `nums1` in-place.
