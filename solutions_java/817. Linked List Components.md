[Leetcode 817. Linked List Components](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l817)
### Problem Statement

You are given the head of a linked list containing unique integer values, and an integer array `nums` that is a subset of the linked list values. The task is to return the number of connected components in the linked list that are formed by the nodes from `nums`.

A connected component of the linked list is a subset of nodes such that:
- Every node in the subset appears in `nums`.
- The nodes in the subset are all adjacent in the original linked list.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format**:
    - **head**: The head of the linked list.
    - **nums**: An array containing some values from the linked list.
2. **Output**:
    - Return an integer representing the number of connected components.

3. **Constraints**:
    - The number of nodes in the linked list is in the range `[1, 10^4]`.
    - `1 <= Node.val <= 10^4`
    - All the values inside the linked list are unique.
    - `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
    - All `nums` values are unique.
    - `nums` is a subset of values in the linked list.

### Strategy

1. **Use a Set**:
    - We will store all elements of `nums` in a set for O(1) average-time complexity look-up.
2. **Traverse the Linked List**:
    - While traversing the linked list, check if the current node's value is in the set.
    - Count a new connected component whenever we encounter the start of a new component (i.e., a node whose value is in the set but the previous node's value was not or it is the start of the list).
3. **Count Components**:
    - Increment the component count at the start of each new component.

### Code

Here's the Java code to accomplish this:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class Solution {
    public int numComponents(ListNode head, int[] nums) {
        Set<Integer> numSet = new HashSet<>();
        // Add all elements of nums into the set
        for (int num : nums) {
            numSet.add(num);
        }
        
        int components = 0;
        boolean inComponent = false;
        
        // Traverse the linked list
        ListNode current = head;
        while (current != null) {
            if (numSet.contains(current.val)) {
                if (!inComponent) {
                    // We found the start of a new component
                    components++;
                    inComponent = true;
                }
            } else {
                // End of the current component
                inComponent = false;
            }
            current = current.next;
        }
        
        return components;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
  - Building the set from `nums`: O(N) where N is the length of `nums`.
  - Traversing the linked list: O(L) where L is the number of nodes in the linked list.

  Thus, the overall time complexity is O(N + L).

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is O(N) due to the storage of elements from `nums` in the set.
