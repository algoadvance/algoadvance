[Leetcode 1405. Longest Happy String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1405)
### Problem Statement

Given three integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, representing the count of letters 'a', 'b', and 'c' respectively, your task is to construct the longest string possible such that no three consecutive characters are the same. The resultant string should be as long as possible under these constraints.

**Example:**
1. Input: `a = 1, b = 1, c = 7`
   Output: `"ccaccbcc"`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the output string include any other characters?**
   - No, the output string should only include the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`?**
   - According to the problem, `a`, `b`, and `c` are non-negative integers.

3. **If multiple valid longest strings are possible, do we need to return all or just one of them?**
   - You need to return just one of the possible longest valid strings.

### Strategy

To solve this problem:
1. **Maximize Use of High Count Characters:** Always try to use the character with the highest count but ensure no three consecutive characters are the same.
2. **Greedy Approach:** Use a greedy approach with a max-heap (priority queue) to always select the character with the highest remaining count.
3. **Use Auxiliary Data Structures:** Use a priority queue to keep track of the counts of characters and an auxiliary structure to temporarily hold characters that can't be used immediately to avoid three consecutive characters.

### Implementation Plan
1. Use a max-heap to store pairs of (count, character).
2. Extract characters from the heap and place them in the result string if they don't violate the constraint of three consecutive characters.
3. If a character can't be used due to the constraint, temporarily hold it until another character is used.
4. Push characters back to the heap after their usage is allowed again.

### Code

Here is the implementation in Java:

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public class LongestHappyString {
    public String longestDiverseString(int a, int b, int c) {
        PriorityQueue<Pair> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((x, y) -> y.count - x.count);
        if (a > 0) pq.offer(new Pair(a, 'a'));
        if (b > 0) pq.offer(new Pair(b, 'b'));
        if (c > 0) pq.offer(new Pair(c, 'c'));
        
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            Pair first = pq.poll();

            if (result.length() >= 2 && result.charAt(result.length() - 1) == first.ch && result.charAt(result.length() - 2) == first.ch) {
                if (pq.isEmpty()) break;
                
                Pair second = pq.poll();
                result.append(second.ch);
                if (--second.count > 0) {
                    pq.offer(second);
                }
                pq.offer(first);
            } else {
                result.append(first.ch);
                if (--first.count > 0) {
                    pq.offer(first);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result.toString();
    }
    
    private static class Pair {
        int count;
        char ch;
        
        Pair(int count, char ch) {
            this.count = count;
            this.ch = ch;
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O((a + b + c) log 3) = O((a + b + c)) because in each step we do constant time operations and at most two heap operations (which are O(log 3)).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) besides the input storage and the output string because we're only storing a fixed number of characters in our heap (at most 3 entries).

This approach ensures that at each step, we are making the decision to maximize string length while maintaining the required constraints.
