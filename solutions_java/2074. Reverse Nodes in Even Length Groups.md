[Leetcode 2074. Reverse Nodes in Even Length Groups](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2074)
## Problem Statement
You are given the head of a linked list and the integer `n`. Reverse the nodes of the list `n` nodes at a time and return the modified list. `n` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to the length of the linked list. Nodes that are reversed should be in-place without changing the node values. 

### Example
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5,6], n = 2
Output: [2,1,4,3,6,5]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Is there a guarantee that the length of the linked list will always be greater than or equal to n?**
    - Yes, as per the problem statement, `n` is guaranteed to be less than or equal to the length of the linked list.
2. **Can we assume the maximum and minimum bounds of n?**
    - Yes, since `n` is guaranteed to be meaningful, we can assume `1 <= n <= length of list`.

## Strategy
1. **Split the list into chunks of size `n`.**
2. **Reverse each chunk individually.**
3. **Reconstruct the list from these chunks.**

### Algorithm:
1. **Initialize Helper Functions:**
   - Helper function `reverseLinkedList` to reverse a linked list segment.
2. **Iterate through the linked list:**
   - For each chunk of size `n`, reverse the chunk using the helper function.
   - Reconstruct the original linked list using the reversed chunks.

## Code
Below is the Java implementation for reversing nodes in groups of `n` in a linked list:

```java
class Solution {
    public ListNode reverseKGroup(ListNode head, int n) {
        if (head == null || n == 1) return head;
        
        ListNode dummy = new ListNode(0);
        dummy.next = head;
        ListNode prev = dummy, current = dummy, next = dummy;
        int count = 0;
        
        // Count the number of nodes in the linked list
        while (current.next != null) {
            current = current.next;
            count++;
        }
        
        // Main loop to process each group of size n
        while (count >= n) {
            current = prev.next;
            next = current.next;
            for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
                current.next = next.next;
                next.next = prev.next;
                prev.next = next;
                next = current.next;
            }
            prev = current;
            count -= n;
        }
        return dummy.next;
    }
}
```
## Explanation:
1. **Initialization:**
   - `dummy` node to simplify the head manipulation.
   - `prev`, `current`, and `next` pointers to help in the reversal process.
2. **Counting Nodes:**
   - Iterate through the list to count the total number of nodes.
3. **Processing Groups:**
   - While there are enough nodes for a complete group (`count >= n`), process each chunk.
   - Use a nested loop to reverse the nodes in each group.
   - Adjust pointers accordingly to keep the rest of the list intact.

## Time Complexity
- **O(n):** Where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list. 
  - Traversing the list to count nodes takes `O(n)`.
  - Reversal of each chunk takes `O(n)` in total because each node is processed exactly once.

This solution is efficient and leverages a straightforward in-place reversal using standard pointer manipulation in linked lists.
