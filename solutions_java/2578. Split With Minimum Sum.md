[Leetcode 2578. Split With Minimum Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2578)
### Problem Statement

2578. Split With Minimum Sum

You are given a positive integer `num`. Split it into two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` such that:
- The concatenation of `num1` and `num2` equals the original integer `num`.
- `num1` and `num2` should not contain any leading zeroes unless they are zero themselves.

Your task is to minimize the sum of the two numbers `num1` and `num2`.

Write a function `splitMinSum` such that:
```java
public int splitMinSum(int num)
```
- `num` is a positive integer. 
- The function returns the minimum possible sum of `num1` and `num2` after splitting `num` as described.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: What is the maximum value of `num`?
   - Assume typical integer constraints: 1 ≤ num ≤ 10^9.
   
2. **Output Requirements**: Are `num1` and `num2` required to be non-zero?
   - They can both be zero if required, otherwise non-negative integers with no leading zeroes.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - What should the function return if `num` contains only one digit?
     - Since `num` can't be split into two non-zero digits meaningfully, we can consider one of the splits as zero. For example, if `num = 5`, the splits can be `num1 = 0` and `num2 = 5` or vice-versa.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, observe that for minimizing the sum of the two numbers `num1` and `num2`, we need to balance their digit values as closely as possible. The following steps will guide our approach:

1. **Convert `num` to a String**: This helps in easily splitting the number at any position.
2. **Generate all Possible Splits**: For a number represented as a string `s`, generate all possible splits at each position `i` where 1 ≤ i ≤ length of `s` - 1.
3. **Calculate Sum of the Splits**: For each split, convert the substrings to integers and calculate their sums.
4. **Find the Minimum Sum**: Track and return the minimum sum encountered among all possible splits.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int splitMinSum(int num) {
        String numStr = String.valueOf(num);
        int minSum = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < numStr.length(); i++) {
            int num1 = Integer.parseInt(numStr.substring(0, i));
            int num2 = Integer.parseInt(numStr.substring(i));
            
            int currentSum = num1 + num2;
            minSum = Math.min(minSum, currentSum);
        }
        
        return minSum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.splitMinSum(4325));  // Test case
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **String Conversion**: O(N), where N is the number of digits in `num`.
- **Substring and Integer Parsing**: Each split operation involves substring and parsing operations which take O(N) for each split since the maximum length of a number (given the constraints) can be up to 10 digits.
- **Total Complexity**: O(N^2) where N is the number of digits in `num`.

This approach effectively balances the simplicity of implementation and efficient computation for typical constraints on `num`.
