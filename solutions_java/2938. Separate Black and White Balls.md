[Leetcode 2938. Separate Black and White Balls](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2938)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting of characters `B` (representing a black ball) and `W` (representing a white ball). Your task is to determine the minimum number of adjacent swaps needed to separate all black balls and white balls, so that all black balls are contiguous and all white balls are contiguous.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the string always guaranteed to have both 'B' and 'W'?**
   - Yes, the problem presumes that there are both 'B' and 'W' in the string.

2. **Do we consider only minimal adjacent swaps or can we swap any two characters directly?**
   - Only adjacent swaps are allowed.

3. **Should the final string have all 'B's followed by all 'W's, or vice versa?**
   - Both configurations are possible, but we need the minimum swaps to achieve either.

4. **Is there a maximum length constraint for the string?**
   - Typically, constraints would be in the problem statement. If not provided, assume reasonable constraints for algorithm efficiency, letâ€™s say 1 <= s.length <= 100,000.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to consider two potential results:
1. All 'B's followed by all 'W's.
2. All 'W's followed by all 'B's.

For each configuration, we calculate the number of swaps required to group all 'B's together and all 'W's together. Then return the minimum of the two calculated values.

**Step-by-Step Algorithm**:
1. Identify the positions of all 'B's in the original string.
2. Calculate the cost to move all 'B's to the leftmost positions (contiguous), maintaining their relative order.
3. Calculate the cost to move all 'B's to the rightmost positions (contiguous), maintaining their relative order.
4. Do the same for 'W's.
5. The minimum value from both approaches will be the answer.

### Code

Here is the Java implementation of the above strategy:

```java
public class SeparateBalls {
    public int minSwaps(String s) {
        char[] chars = s.toCharArray();
        List<Integer> bPositions = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Integer> wPositions = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Collect positions of 'B' and 'W'
        for (int i = 0; i < chars.length; i++) {
            if (chars[i] == 'B') {
                bPositions.add(i);
            } else {
                wPositions.add(i);
            }
        }
        
        // Calculate swaps for 'B's to be contiguous on the left and 'W's on the left
        int swapsForBLeft = calculateSwaps(bPositions, bPositions.size());
        int swapsForBRight = calculateSwaps(bPositions, chars.length - bPositions.size());
        
        int swapsForWLeft = calculateSwaps(wPositions, wPositions.size());
        int swapsForWRight = calculateSwaps(wPositions, chars.length - wPositions.size());
        
        // Minimum swaps to achieve either configuration
        return Math.min(swapsForBLeft, swapsForBRight, swapsForWLeft, swapsForWRight);
    }
    
    private int calculateSwaps(List<Integer> positions, int targetStart) {
        int swaps = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < positions.size(); i++) {
            swaps += Math.abs(positions.get(i) - (targetStart + i));
        }
        return swaps;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SeparateBalls obj = new SeparateBalls();
        System.out.println(obj.minSwaps("BWBBWBB")); // Example usage
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Space Complexity**: O(n)
   - Storing positions of 'B' and 'W' can take O(n) space in the worst case.
  
2. **Time Complexity**: O(n)
   - We iterate through the string only a constant number of times for position collection and swaps calculation.

With this approach, the algorithm should efficiently solve the problem within typical constraints.
