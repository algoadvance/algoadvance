[Leetcode 938. Range Sum of BST full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l938)
### Problem Statement
You are given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST) and two integers `low` and `high`. You need to return the sum of values of all nodes with a value in the inclusive range `[low, high]`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: What is the range of the integers in the tree and the values of `low` and `high`?**
   - A: The problem constraints (in a typical environment) will ensure that these values are within the bounds of a 32-bit signed integer.

2. **Q: Is the BST provided always valid and properly structured?**
   - A: Yes, you can assume the tree will always be a valid Binary Search Tree.

3. **Q: Can the BST have duplicate values?**
   - A: No, typically BSTs do not contain duplicate values.

4. **Q: Can the tree be empty?**
   - A: Yes, the tree can be empty. If it is, the function should return 0.

### Strategy
1. **Traversal Method Selection:**
   - Since this is a BST, properties of BST should be leveraged. For this problem, Depth-First Search (DFS) approach using recursion is suitable. We could also use a stack for iterative DFS, but recursive DFS simplifies the implementation.

2. **Condition Checks:**
   - Traverse the tree and for each node:
     - If the node's value is within the range `[low, high]`, add its value to the sum.
     - If the node’s value is greater than `low`, there might be nodes in the left subtree within the range, so explore the left subtree.
     - If the node’s value is less than `high`, there might be nodes in the right subtree within the range, so explore the right subtree.

3. **Base Case:**
   - If the current node is `null`, return 0 since it does not contribute to the sum.

### Code
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public int rangeSumBST(TreeNode root, int low, int high) {
        // If the current node is null, return 0 as there's no value to add
        if (root == null) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Initialize the sum to 0
        int sum = 0;

        // If the current node's value is within the range, add it to the sum
        if (root.val >= low && root.val <= high) {
            sum += root.val;
        }

        // If the current node's value is greater than low, check the left subtree
        if (root.val > low) {
            sum += rangeSumBST(root.left, low, high);
        }

        // If the current node's value is less than high, check the right subtree
        if (root.val < high) {
            sum += rangeSumBST(root.right, low, high);
        }

        // Return the computed sum
        return sum;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the BST. In the worst case, we may need to visit all nodes.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(H)`, where `H` is the height of the BST. This accounts for the recursive call stack, which in the worst case of an unbalanced tree could be `O(N)` (typically `O(log N)` for balanced trees).
