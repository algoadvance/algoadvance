[Leetcode 153. Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l153)
## Problem Statement
Suppose an array of length `n` sorted in ascending order is rotated between `1` and `n` (inclusive) times. For example, the array `nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` might become:
- `[4,5,6,7,0,1,2]` if it was rotated `4` times.
- `[0,1,2,4,5,6,7]` if it was rotated `7` times (i.e., not rotated at all).

You are given a rotated sorted array `nums` of unique elements and need to return the minimum element of this array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the array be empty?
   - No, the array will have at least one element.
2. Are there any duplicates in the array?
   - No, the array contains unique elements.

## Strategy
Given the constraints and the requirement for logarithmic time complexity, a binary search approach is suitable. Hereâ€™s the strategy:
1. Use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to perform the binary search.
2. Calculate the middle index as `mid = left + (right - left) / 2`.
3. Compare `nums[mid]` with `nums[right]` to determine which part of the array to search next:
   - If `nums[mid] > nums[right]`, then the smallest value must be to the right of `mid` (including `right` itself).
   - If `nums[mid] <= nums[right]`, then the smallest value is to the left of `mid`, including the middle element itself.
4. Adjust the pointers accordingly and repeat the process until `left` equals `right`, where the minimum element will be located at index `left`.

## Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int findMin(int[] nums) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            if (nums[mid] > nums[right]) {
                // Minimum must be in the right part
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                // Minimum could be at mid or in the left part
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        
        return nums[left];
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(log n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array. This is due to the binary search approach that reduces the search space by approximately half in each iteration.

The space complexity is `O(1)` since no extra space is used besides a few variables.
