[Leetcode 459. Repeated Substring Pattern](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l459)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, check if it can be constructed by taking a substring of it and appending multiple copies of the substring together. You need to return `true` if `s` can be constructed from a substring, otherwise return `false`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "abab"
Output: true
Explanation: It is the substring "ab" twice.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "aba"
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "abcabcabcabc"
Output: true
Explanation: It is the substring "abc" four times.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length of the input string?**
   - The length of the string `s` will be between 1 and 10^4.

2. **What characters are allowed in the input string?**
   - The input string `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.

3. **Should the solution be case-sensitive?**
   - As the input contains only lowercase English letters, case-sensitivity is not an issue.

4. **Are there any constraints on memory usage?**
   - No specific constraints, but the solution should be efficient given the potential length of the input.

### Strategy

The problem can be solved by utilizing a string manipulation trick:

1. **Double the string**: If `s` is composed of repeating a substring, doubling `s` and then removing the first and the last character will still contain `s` somewhere in the middle.
2. **Search for the original string in this modified string**: If the modified string contains the original string, then the original string is a repeating substring pattern.

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public boolean repeatedSubstringPattern(String s) {
        String doubled = s + s;
        String modified = doubled.substring(1, doubled.length() - 1);
        return modified.contains(s);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this approach is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
  - This is because all operations (concatenation, substring, and contains) are linear in terms of the length of the string.

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Double the string**:
   - Concatenate `s` with itself to get `doubled = s + s`.

2. **Modify the doubled string**:
   - Remove the first and the last character from `doubled` to form `modified`.

3. **Check for the pattern**:
   - If `s` is present in `modified`, then `s` can be formed by repeating some substring. Hence, return `true`.
   - Otherwise, return `false`.

This approach leverages string manipulation to efficiently determine if a string has a repeated substring pattern.
