[Leetcode 1960. Maximum Product of the Length of Two Palindromic Substrings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1960)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, you are asked to find the maximum product of the lengths of two non-overlapping palindromic substrings such that:

1. The first palindromic substring occurs before the second palindromic substring in `s`.
2. The substrings do not overlap.

In simple terms, split the string into two parts, find the longest palindromic substring in each part, and then compute the product of their lengths. Return the maximum product of such lengths.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Overlapping of substrings**: Should the substrings be strictly non-overlapping, or can they touch ends?
   - **Answer**: They should be strictly non-overlapping.

2. **Empty substring consideration**: What should we do if one of the parts does not contain a palindromic substring?
   - **Answer**: We ignore cases where any of the parts has no palindromic substring.

3. **Case sensitivity**: Is the string case-sensitive?
   - **Answer**: Yes, the string is case-sensitive.

4. **Length constraints**: Are there any constraints on the string length?
   - **Answer**: The length of the string `s` will be within the range `[2, 10^5]`.

### Strategy

1. **Palindrome Finding Algorithm**:
   - Use Dynamic Programming to preprocess and find the longest palindromic substring ending at each index.
   - Use Dynamic Programming to preprocess and find the longest palindromic substring starting at each index.

2. **Splitting Points**:
   - Use the preprocessed palindrome lengths to compute the maximum product for each possible split point.

3. **Sliding Window**:
   - Maintain the maximum palindromic length up to and including index `i` for the left part.
   - Maintain the maximum palindromic length from index `i+1` to the end for the right part.

4. **Maximization**:
   - Iterate through possible split points, compute the product of the maximum lengths from each part, and track the maximum product.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxProduct(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[] maxLeft = new int[n];
        int[] maxRight = new int[n];

        // Dynamic programming to find the maximum palindromic substring length ending at each index
        boolean[][] dp = new boolean[n][n];
        
        // Initializing dp table
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i][i] = true;
            if (i < n - 1 && s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i + 1)) {
                dp[i][i + 1] = true;
            }
        }
        
        // Filling dp table for longer substrings
        for(int length = 3; length <= n; length++) {
            for(int i = 0; i <= n - length; i++) {
                int j = i + length - 1;
                if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j) && dp[i + 1][j - 1]) {
                    dp[i][j] = true;
                }
            }
        }

        // Calculating maxLeft
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for(int j = 0; j <= i; j++) {
                if (dp[j][i]) {
                    maxLeft[i] = Math.max(maxLeft[i], i - j + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        // Calculating maxRight
        for(int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            for(int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                if (dp[i][j]) {
                    maxRight[i] = Math.max(maxRight[i], j - i + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Propagate maximum value from left to right for maxLeft
        for(int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            maxLeft[i] = Math.max(maxLeft[i], maxLeft[i - 1]);
        }

        // Propagate maximum value from right to left for maxRight
        for(int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
            maxRight[i] = Math.max(maxRight[i], maxRight[i + 1]);
        }

        // Calculating the maximum product of lengths
        int maxProduct = 0;
        for(int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            maxProduct = Math.max(maxProduct, maxLeft[i] * maxRight[i + 1]);
        }

        return maxProduct;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Initialization and filling DP table**: This takes \(O(n^2)\) where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
2. **Filling maxLeft and maxRight arrays**: This takes \(O(n^2)\) as we might look back up to `n` indices in the worst case for each entry.
3. **Propagating maximum values**: This takes \(O(n)\) for each array.
4. **Combining results to find the max product**: This takes \(O(n)\).

Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the \(O(n^2)\) complexity of filling the DP table and the maxLeft, maxRight arrays. Therefore, the solution has a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\).
