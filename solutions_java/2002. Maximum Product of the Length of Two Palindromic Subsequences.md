[Leetcode 2002. Maximum Product of the Length of Two Palindromic Subsequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2002)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s`. You need to find the maximum product of the lengths of two non-overlapping palindromic subsequences of `s`. A palindromic subsequence is a subsequence that reads the same backward as forward.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the two subsequences overlap?**
   - No, the two subsequences must be non-overlapping.

2. **What is the maximum length of the string `s`?**
   - The maximum length of `s` can be up to 12 characters.

3. **Are there any constraints on the characters of the string `s`?**
   - The string `s` consists of only lowercase English letters.

4. **Is the input string guaranteed to have at least two characters?**
   - Yes, since finding two non-overlapping subsequences with a single-character string does not make sense.

### Strategy
Given the constraints, a brute-force approach involving bit manipulation to generate subsequences can be feasible:
1. **Subsequence Generation:** Use bit manipulation to generate all possible non-empty subsequences of the string.
2. **Palindrome Check:** Check if each generated subsequence is a palindrome.
3. **Combination of Subsequences:** Check all pairs of non-overlapping palindromic subsequences and compute the product of their lengths.
4. **Max Product Calculation:** Track the maximum product found.

### Code

Here's a possible implementation of the strategy described:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    
    private String s;
    private int maxProduct = 0;

    public int maxProduct(String s) {
        this.s = s;
        List<String> palindromicSubsequences = generatePalindromicSubsequences();
        int n = palindromicSubsequences.size();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
                String subseq1 = palindromicSubsequences.get(i);
                String subseq2 = palindromicSubsequences.get(j);
                
                if (noOverlap(subseq1, subseq2)) {
                    int product = subseq1.length() * subseq2.length();
                    maxProduct = Math.max(maxProduct, product);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return maxProduct;
    }
    
    private List<String> generatePalindromicSubsequences() {
        List<String> palindromicSubseqs = new ArrayList<>();
        int n = s.length();
        for (int i = 1; i < (1 << n); i++) {
            StringBuilder subseq = new StringBuilder();
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if ((i & (1 << j)) != 0) {
                    subseq.append(s.charAt(j));
                }
            }
            if (isPalindrome(subseq.toString())) {
                palindromicSubseqs.add(subseq.toString());
            }
        }
        return palindromicSubseqs;
    }
    
    private boolean isPalindrome(String str) {
        int l = 0, r = str.length() - 1;
        while (l < r) {
            if (str.charAt(l++) != str.charAt(r--)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    private boolean noOverlap(String subseq1, String subseq2) {
        int[] positions = new int[s.length()];
        for (char c : subseq1.toCharArray()) positions[s.indexOf(c)]++;
        for (char c : subseq2.toCharArray()) if (positions[s.indexOf(c)]++ > 0) return false;
        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.maxProduct("acdapmpomp")); // Expected Output: The maximum product
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Generating Subsequence:** As we generate all subsequences using bit manipulation, we have \(2^n\) possible subsequences.
- **Palindrome Checking:** Checking each subsequence is \(O(n)\).
- **Combination Checking:** All pairs of subsequences is \(O((2^n)^2) = O(4^n)\).

Hence, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \cdot 4^n)\), which is feasible for \(n \leq 12\).
