[Leetcode 1728. Cat and Mouse II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1728)
### Problem Statement

We are given a rectangular grid with rows and columns represented by `grid`, where:

- grid[i][j] == 'C' represents a cell where a cat starts.
- grid[i][j] == 'M' represents a cell where a mouse starts.
- grid[i][j] == 'F' represents a cell where food is located.
- grid[i][j] == '#' represents an empty wall.
- grid[i][j] == '.' represents an empty path.

The mouse and cat alternate turns to move. The mouse goes first and they can move in 4 possible directions (left, right, up, down). The mouse can move up to `mouseJump` steps per turn, and the cat can move up to `catJump` steps per turn. The mouse can win if it reaches the food before the cat, or if it can maneuver such that the cat will visit the same cell too many times (1000 moves). The cat wins if it reaches the food before the mouse, or catches the mouse.

Return `true` if the mouse wins, and `false` if the cat wins.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: grid = ["####F",
               "#C...",
               "M...."],
mouseJump = 1,
catJump = 2

Output: true
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Do mouse and cat move one at a time, i.e., mouse moves first, then cat?**
   - Yes, the mouse moves first, followed by the cat.

2. **What happens if the cat and mouse reach the food at the same time?**
   - Such a situation should not occur; simplistic assumptions of the game mechanics would prevent that from happening.

3. **What are the bounds for rows, columns, `mouseJump`, and `catJump`?**
   - Typical constraints would involve sizes manageable within computational limits, such as rows and columns <= 100 and jumps <= 10.

4. **How many turns can be a maximum (or a logical step to break the computation)?**
   - The maximum number of turns is 1000 each by either player moving 500 times.

### Strategy

This problem is a combinatorial game theory problem and can be approached using dynamic programming (DP) with memoization to avoid recalculating states. 

The strategy involves:
1. Modeling all possible states, i.e., positions of the cat, mouse, turn number, and current player (mouse or cat).
2. Using DP to memorize the results of specific game states.
3. Implementing rules where a move results in either a win or a loss situation (mouse reaching food, cat reaching food, cat catching mouse).

### Code

Here is a possible implementation of the solution:

```java
public class CatMouseGame {
    private static final char CAT = 'C';
    private static final char MOUSE = 'M';
    private static final char FOOD = 'F';
    private static final char WALL = '#';
    private static final char EMPTY = '.';
    private static final int[][] DIRS = // use example from above
    private static final int MAX_TURNS = 1000;
    private int rows, cols;
    private int mouseJump, catJump;
    private int[][][][][] dp;

    public boolean canMouseWin(String[] grid, int mouseJump, int catJump) {
        this.rows = grid.length;
        this.cols = grid[0].length();
        this.mouseJump = mouseJump;
        this.catJump = catJump;
        this.dp = new int[rows][cols][rows][cols][2];

        int mouseRow = -1, mouseCol = -1, catRow = -1, catCol = -1;

        // Initialize positions of mouse, cat, and food
        for (int r = 0; r < rows; ++r) {
            for (int c = 0; c < cols; ++c) {
                if (grid[r].charAt(c) == 'M') {
                    mouseRow = r;
                    mouseCol = c;
                } else if (grid[r].charAt(c) == 'C') {
                    catRow = r;
                    catCol = c;
                }
            }
        }

        return dfs(grid, mouseRow, mouseCol, catRow, catCol, 0, 0);
    }

    // DFS function to simulate the game
    private boolean dfs(String[] grid, int mouseRow, int mouseCol, int catRow, int catCol, int turns, int isMouseTurn) {
        if (turns >= MAX_TURNS * 2) {
            return false; // Reached maximum number of turns allowed
        }
        if (grid[mouseRow].charAt(mouseCol) == FOOD) {
            return true; // Mouse reached food first
        }
        if (grid[catRow].charAt(catCol) == FOOD || (mouseRow == catRow && mouseCol == catCol)) {
            return false; // Cat reached food or caught the mouse
        }
        if (dp[mouseRow][mouseCol][catRow][catCol][isMouseTurn] != 0) {
            return dp[mouseRow][mouseCol][catRow][catCol][isMouseTurn] == 1;
        }

        boolean win = isMouseTurn == 1;

        int[] currentPlayerDir = isMouseTurn == 1 ? new int[]{mouseRow, mouseCol, mouseJump} : new int[]{catRow, catCol, catJump};
        for (int[] dir : DIRS) {
            for (int step = 0; step <= currentPlayerDir[2]; ++step) {
                int newRow = currentPlayerDir[0] + dir[0] * step;
                int newCol = currentPlayerDir[1] + dir[1] * step;
                if (newRow < 0 || newRow >= rows || newCol < 0 || newCol >= cols || grid[newRow].charAt(newCol) == WALL) {
                    break;
                }
                if (isMouseTurn == 1 && !dfs(grid, newRow, newCol, catRow, catCol, turns + 1, 0)) {
                    win = true;
                    break;
                }
                if (isMouseTurn == 0 && dfs(grid, mouseRow, mouseCol, newRow, newCol, turns + 1, 1)) {
                    win = false;
                    break;
                }
                if (step == 0) {
                    break; // Stay in place move counts too
                }
            }
            if (isMouseTurn == 1 && win) {
                break;
            }
            if (isMouseTurn == 0 && !win) {
                break;
            }
        }

        dp[mouseRow][mouseCol][catRow][catCol][isMouseTurn] = win ? 1 : 2;
        return win;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution primarily revolves around the depth of recursion and the state space being explored. 

If `R` and `C` are the number of rows and columns, respectively, the state space can be approximated as:
- O(R * C * R * C * T) where T is denoting the maximum turns.

The dynamic programming technique ensures that repeated states are not recalculated, thus the constraint primarily becomes polynomial rather than exponential, limited by the worst-case permissible number of turns and the size of the grid.

This concludes the explanation and solution to the problem "Cat and Mouse II".
