[Leetcode 3250. Find the Count of Monotonic Pairs I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3250)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of integers `arr` of length `n` and need to find the count of monotonic pairs in the array `arr`.

A pair `(i, j)` is considered monotonic if:
- `0 <= i < j < n`
- `arr[i] <= arr[j]`

#### Example:
```plaintext
Input: arr = [3, 5, 4, 2, 8]
Output: 7
Explanation:
The monotonic pairs are:
(0, 1), (0, 2), (0, 4), (1, 2), (1, 4), (2, 4), and (3, 4)
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the array guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, the array will have at least one element.
2. **What should we return if the array has less than 2 elements?**
   - If `n` < 2, then there can’t be any pairs, so the output should be `0`.

### Strategy
The brute-force method involves checking every possible pair to see if it satisfies the conditions. However, this will result in a time complexity of `O(n^2)`, which may be inefficient for large input sizes.

Instead, we can leverage a more efficient sorting and counting mechanism:
1. Utilize a data structure (like a Fenwick Tree or Binary Indexed Tree) to keep track of the counts and facilitate efficient range sum queries.
2. Traverse through each element, use the data structure to count how many previous elements are less than or equal to the current element.
3. Update the data structure with the current element.

Here’s the more efficient approach using a Fenwick Tree (Binary Indexed Tree) to maintain the counts and perform range sums:

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int countMonotonicPairs(int[] arr) {
        int n = arr.length;
        if (n < 2) return 0;
        
        int maxVal = 0;
        for (int num : arr) {
            maxVal = Math.max(maxVal, num);
        }
        
        FenwickTree fenwickTree = new FenwickTree(maxVal + 1);

        int count = 0;
        for (int num : arr) {
            count += fenwickTree.query(num);
            fenwickTree.update(num, 1);
        }
        
        return count;
    }

    class FenwickTree {
        private int[] tree;
        private int size;

        public FenwickTree(int size) {
            this.size = size;
            this.tree = new int[size + 1];
        }

        public void update(int index, int delta) {
            for (; index <= size; index += index & -index) {
                tree[index] += delta;
            }
        }

        public int query(int index) {
            int sum = 0;
            for (; index > 0; index -= index & -index) {
                sum += tree[index];
            }
            return sum;
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] arr = {3, 5, 4, 2, 8};
        System.out.println(solution.countMonotonicPairs(arr));  // Output 7
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization and finding the max value:** O(n)
- **Each update and query operation in Fenwick Tree:** O(log(maxVal))
- The overall complexity for processing each element is O(n log(maxVal)) where `maxVal` is the maximum value in the array.

This is efficient compared to the brute-force approach and will work well within typical constraints.
