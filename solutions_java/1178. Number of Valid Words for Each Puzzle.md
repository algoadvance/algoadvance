[Leetcode 1178. Number of Valid Words for Each Puzzle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1178)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of strings `words` and a list of strings `puzzles`. Each puzzle is a string representing a list of characters. A word is considered valid for a given puzzle if:

1. The word contains at least the first character of the puzzle.
2. All the characters in the word exist in the puzzle.

You need to return an array of integers where each integer represents the number of valid words for the corresponding puzzle.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Can the same word appear multiple times in the words list?
   - Are the puzzles guaranteed to have unique characters?

2. **Output:**
   - Do we need to return the results in the order of puzzles given?

### Strategy

1. **Bitmask Representation:**
   - Use bit masking to represent the characters in both words and puzzles.
   - This optimizes the checking process, allowing us to efficiently determine if a word can be formed from the puzzle characters.

2. **Word and Puzzle Masks:**
   - Compute a bitmask for each word where each bit represents whether the corresponding character (from 'a' to 'z') is present in the word.
   - Similarly, compute a bitmask for each puzzle and ensure the first character's bit is checked separately because it has to be present in the word.

3. **Mapping Words:**
   - Use a `HashMap` to store the frequency of each word bitmask.
   - Check each puzzle bitmask against the word bitmasks to count valid words.
   
4. **Optimized Checking:**
   - To check whether a word can be formed using the letters in a puzzle, weâ€™ll use submask enumeration of the puzzle bitmask.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the said strategy in Java:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class NumberOfValidWordsForEachPuzzle {
    public int[] findNumOfValidWords(String[] words, String[] puzzles) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> wordMaskCount = new HashMap<>();

        // Create bitmask for each word and count the frequency
        for (String word : words) {
            int mask = createBitmask(word);
            wordMaskCount.put(mask, wordMaskCount.getOrDefault(mask, 0) + 1);
        }

        int[] result = new int[puzzles.length];

        for (int i = 0; i < puzzles.length; i++) {
            String puzzle = puzzles[i];
            int puzzleMask = createBitmask(puzzle);
            int firstLetterMask = 1 << (puzzle.charAt(0) - 'a');
            
            int count = 0;
            // Using submask enumeration
            for (int subMask = puzzleMask; subMask > 0; subMask = (subMask - 1) & puzzleMask) {
                if ((subMask & firstLetterMask) != 0 && wordMaskCount.containsKey(subMask)) {
                    count += wordMaskCount.get(subMask);
                }
            }
            result[i] = count;
        }

        return result;
    }

    private int createBitmask(String word) {
        int mask = 0;
        for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
            mask |= (1 << (c - 'a'));
        }
        return mask;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Word Processing:** O(N) where N is the number of words. Creating a bitmask and counting the frequency for each word is O(L) in the worst case where L is the length of the word.
- **Puzzle Processing:** O(M * 2^P) where M is the number of puzzles and P is the number of unique characters in the puzzle (at most 7). Enumerating all submasks of a puzzle's bitmask is O(2^P).

Hence, the overall time complexity is efficient given the constraints of the problem.
