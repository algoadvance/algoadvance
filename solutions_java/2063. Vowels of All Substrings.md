[Leetcode 2063. Vowels of All Substrings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2063)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `word`, return the sum of the number of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) in every substring of `word`.

A **substring** is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: word = "aba"
Output: 6
Explanation:
The substrings of "aba" are: "a", "b", "a", "ab", "ba", "aba".
- "a" -> 1 vowel
- "b" -> 0 vowels
- "a" -> 1 vowel
- "ab" -> 1 vowel
- "ba" -> 1 vowel
- "aba" -> 2 vowels
Total number of vowels = 1 + 0 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the maximum length of the input string `word`? This will help determine the efficiency requirement.
   - Is the input string guaranteed to consist of lowercase English letters only?

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Should the function always output an integer?
   - Are there any specific edge cases we need to consider (e.g., an empty string)?

### Strategy

1. **Identify Vowels**: We're concerned only with vowels (`a`, `e`, `i`, `o`, `u`).
  
2. **Count Vowels Efficiently**:
   - For each vowel found at position `i` in the string, determine how many substrings this vowel will appear in.
   - A character at position `i` can be part of substrings that start anywhere from the start of the string up to `i` and end anywhere from `i` to the end of the string.
   
   Specifically, for a vowel at position `i`, it contributes to `(i + 1) * (n - i)` substrings (where `n` is the length of the string).

3. **Sum Contributions**: Sum the contributions of all vowels for the final result.

### Code

Here's the Java implementation of the solution:

```java
public class VowelSubstrings {
    public static long countVowelSubstrings(String word) {
        long result = 0;
        int n = word.length();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            char ch = word.charAt(i);
            if (isVowel(ch)) {
                result += (long) (i + 1) * (n - i);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    private static boolean isVowel(char ch) {
        return ch == 'a' || ch == 'e' || ch == 'i' || ch == 'o' || ch == 'u';
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String word = "aba";
        System.out.println(countVowelSubstrings(word));  // Output: 6
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where `n` is the length of the input string. This is because we are going through the string once and for each character, we are performing constant-time operations.

### Explanation

1. **Outer Loop**: Iterates over each character in the string.
2. **Vowel Check**: Uses a helper function `isVowel` to check if the character is a vowel.
3. **Contribution Calculation**: For each vowel, calculate how many substrings it appears in and sum up the contributions.
   
This solution is efficient and meets the constraints effectively.
