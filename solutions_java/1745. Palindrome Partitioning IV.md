### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 1745: Palindrome Partitioning IV

Given a string `s`, return `true` if it is possible to split the string `s` into three non-empty palindromic substrings. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:** 
   - Does the input string `s` contain only lowercase English letters?
   - What is the maximum length of the string `s`?

2. **Output Constraints:**
   - We need to return a boolean value indicating whether the string can be split into three palindromic substrings.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - How should we handle strings that are already palindromes?
   - What if the length of the string is less than 3 (in which case it's impossible to split into three non-empty substrings)?

### Example

```java
Input: s = "abcbdd"
Output: true
Explanation: "a", "bcb", and "dd" are palindromic substrings.

Input: s = "bcbddxy"
Output: false
```

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming for Palindromes:**
   - Use dynamic programming to preprocess and determine if any substring `s[i:j]` is a palindrome.
   - Create a 2D boolean array `isPalindrome` where `isPalindrome[i][j]` is `true` if the substring `s[i:j]` is a palindrome.

2. **Three-way Split Check:**
   - Iterate through possible split points to check if the string can be split into three palindromic substrings.
   - For each valid split of the string at indices `i` and `j`, check if `s[0:i]`, `s[i:j]` and `s[j:n]` are palindromes using the `isPalindrome` array.

### Code

Here's a Java solution implementing the above strategy.

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean checkPartitioning(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        
        // Corner case: if string length is less than 3, can't split into 3 parts
        if (n < 3) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // Step 1: Create a DP table to check palindrome substrings
        boolean[][] isPalindrome = new boolean[n][n];
        
        // Fill the DP table
        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            for (int left = 0; left <= right; left++) {
                if (s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right) && (right - left <= 2 || isPalindrome[left + 1][right - 1])) {
                    isPalindrome[left][right] = true;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Step 2: Check for three-way splits
        for (int i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = i; j < n - 1; j++) {
                if (isPalindrome[0][i - 1] && isPalindrome[i][j] && isPalindrome[j + 1][n - 1]) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing Palindrome Check**: The time complexity to fill the `isPalindrome` table is \(O(n^2)\) where \(n\) is the length of the string. This is because we are evaluating every possible substring of the string.
- **Three-way Split Check**: We use two nested loops to evaluate possible splits, which results in an \(O(n^2)\) time complexity.
- **Overall Time Complexity**: \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input string.

This approach ensures that we efficiently process the string to check if it can be split into three palindromic substrings.
