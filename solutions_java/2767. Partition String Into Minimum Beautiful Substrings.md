[Leetcode 2767. Partition String Into Minimum Beautiful Substrings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2767)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` that consists of the digits `'1'` to `'9'` inclusive. Your task is to partition the string into the minimum number of beautiful substrings.

A beautiful substring is defined as:
1. A substring that consists of only two different characters.
2. For example, if the input string is `1223334444`, a beautiful substring would be `122`, `333`, `4444`, etc.

Return the minimum number of beautiful substrings that you can partition the given string `s` into.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
   - Can the input string have characters other than `'1'` to `'9'`?

2. **Output:**
   - Are we returning the count of the substrings or the substrings themselves?
   - Do we need to ensure that the substrings are non-overlapping?

3. **Additional Details:**
   - Are all digits guaranteed to be contiguous within each beautiful substring?

Let's assume the maximum length of `s` is 1000 for practicality and that we need only to return the count of beautiful substrings.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - A counter to hold the minimum number of beautiful substrings.
   - A variable to keep track of the ongoing unique characters in current substring.

2. **Iterate through the String:**
   - For each character in the string, check if it is one of the two current unique characters.
   - If it is, continue adding the character to this beautiful substring.
   - If it is not, increase the counter and reset the tracking variables starting a new beautiful substring.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - A string with all unique characters, in which case each character itself is a "beautiful substring".

### Code

```java
public class BeautifulSubstring {
    public static int minBeautifulSubstrings(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.length() == 0) return 0;
        if (s.length() == 1) return 1;

        int count = 0;
        int substringStart = 0;

        while (substringStart < s.length()) {
            // Use a set to keep track of unique characters in this segment
            Set<Character> charSet = new HashSet<>();
            
            int i = substringStart;
            
            while (i < s.length()) {
                charSet.add(s.charAt(i));
                
                if (charSet.size() > 2) {
                    break;
                }
                
                i++;
            }
            
            // We found a beautiful substring
            count++;
            // Move to the next potential start of a substring
            substringStart = i;
        }
        
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test cases
        System.out.println(minBeautifulSubstrings("1223334444")); // Expected output: 3
        System.out.println(minBeautifulSubstrings("111222")); // Expected output: 2
        System.out.println(minBeautifulSubstrings("123456789")); // Expected output: 9
        System.out.println(minBeautifulSubstrings("112233445566")); // Expected output: 6
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The approach iterates through the string once with a nested loop that in the worst case may look at each element twice. Therefore, the time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string.
  
- **Space Complexity:** The use of a set to store at most two characters results in a space complexity of \(O(1)\). 

This solution ensures that we find the minimum number of beautiful substrings by breaking the string optimally.
