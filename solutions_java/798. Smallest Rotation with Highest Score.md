[Leetcode 798. Smallest Rotation with Highest Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l798)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` of integers. In one rotation operation, you shift the last element of the array to the first place.

For example, if `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, after one rotation, the array becomes `[5, 1, 2, 3, 4]`. 

We define the rotation score of `nums` as the number of indices where `nums[i] == i` after the array has been rotated. 

Your task is to return the smallest number of rotations such that the rotation score is maximized.

### Example:
- Example 1:
  ```
  Input: nums = [2, 3, 1, 4, 0]
  Output: 3
  Explanation: 
    [2, 3, 1, 4, 0] -> [0, 2, 3, 1, 4] -> [4, 0, 2, 3, 1] -> [1, 4, 0, 2, 3] -> [3, 1, 4, 0, 2]
    Score after 3 rotations = 3 ([1, 4, 0, 2, 3])
  ```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Uniqueness**: Are all elements in the array unique?
   - **Answer**: Yes, in the given examples they are unique.
   
2. **Range of Values**: What is the range of values we can expect in the array?
   - **Answer**: The values are non-negative integers within reasonable limits (confirmed within problem constraints).

3. **Array Size**: What is the size of the array?
   - **Answer**: It's guaranteed by problem constraints (1 <= nums.length <= 20000).

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int bestRotation(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] change = new int[n];
        
        // Calculate the change array.
        // Change array holds how much score gets changed 
        // if we remove it from the rotation at that index.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            change[(i - nums[i] + 1 + n) % n]--;
        }
        
        // Aggregate the change array
        int maxScore = 0;
        int ans = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            change[i] += change[i - 1] + 1;
            if (change[i] > maxScore) {
                maxScore = change[i];
                ans = i;
            }
        }
        return ans;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution s = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {2, 3, 1, 4, 0};
        System.out.println(s.bestRotation(nums)); // Outputs: 3
    }
}
```

## Strategy
1. **Change Analysis**: We use an array `change` to maintain the change in score when rotating. The `change` array holds how much the score will be affected when a specific rotation is made.
2. **Score Calculation**:
    - Decrement the initial change for each index with `-1`.
    - Consolidate prefix sums to find the maximum score obtained with the minimum number of shifts.
3. **Result Extraction**: Traverse through the `change` array and keep track of the maximum score and corresponding rotation index.

## Time Complexity
- **Preprocessing (change array construction)**: O(n)
- **Result Calculation (prefix sum and max tracking)**: O(n)

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the input array.
