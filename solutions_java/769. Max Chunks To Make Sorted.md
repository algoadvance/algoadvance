[Leetcode 769. Max Chunks To Make Sorted](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l769)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `arr` which represents a permutation of the first `n` positive integers, where `n` is the array's length. You need to partition the array into a maximum number of "chunks" (partitions), which can be individually sorted, and after concatenating them, the entire array returns to being sorted in increasing order.

Return the maximum number of chunks we can partition the array into.

### Example
1. **Input**: `arr = [4,3,2,1,0]`
   **Output**: `1`
2. **Input**: `arr = [1,0,2,3,4]`
   **Output**: `4`

### Constraints
- `n == arr.length`
- `1 <= n <= 10^4`
- `0 <= arr[i] < n`
- All the integers in `arr` are unique.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the array have negative numbers?  
   *No, the array consists of the first `n` positive integers (including zero).*
2. Is the input guaranteed to be a permutation of the first `n` positive integers?  
   *Yes.*

### Strategy
To determine the maximum number of chunks, we can use a greedy algorithm. The key observation is that we can form a chunk ending at index `i` if the maximum value of the elements in the chunk so far is `i`. This ensures that all numbers up to `i` have appeared in the segment, and thus it can be sorted independently.

Here's a step-by-step strategy:
1. Initialize `max_so_far` to `0` and `count_chunks` to `0`.
2. Iterate through the array.
3. For each index `i`, update `max_so_far` to be the maximum value observed so far.
4. If `max_so_far` equals the current index `i`, it means all values up to `i` have been encountered, and we can form a chunk ending at index `i`. Increment the chunk counter.
5. Return `count_chunks` at the end.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the strategy in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxChunksToSorted(int[] arr) {
        int maxSoFar = 0;
        int countChunks = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            maxSoFar = Math.max(maxSoFar, arr[i]);
            if (maxSoFar == i) {
                countChunks++;
            }
        }
        
        return countChunks;
    }
}
```

### Explanation
- **maxSoFar**: Tracks the maximum value encountered so far in the iteration.
- **countChunks**: Counts the number of valid chunks.
- As we iterate through the array, we update `maxSoFar` with the maximum of itself and the current element.
- Whenever `maxSoFar` equals the current index `i`, it indicates that all numbers up to `i` are within this segment, making it a valid chunk.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(n) because we only need a single pass through the array to determine the maximum number of chunks.
- The space complexity is O(1) as we utilize a fixed amount of additional space regardless of the input size.
