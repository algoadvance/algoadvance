[Leetcode 918. Maximum Sum Circular Subarray](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l918)
### Problem Statement:
Given a circular integer array `nums` of length `n`, find the maximum possible sum of a non-empty subarray of `nums`.

A circular array means the end of the array connects to the beginning of the array. Formally, the next element of `nums[i]` is `nums[(i + 1) % n]` and the previous element of `nums[i]` is `nums[(i - 1 + n) % n]`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,-2,3,-2]
Output: 3
Explanation: Subarray [3] has maximum sum 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [5,-3,5]
Output: 10
Explanation: Subarray [5,5] has maximum sum 10.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [-3,-2,-3]
Output: -2
Explanation: Subarray [-2] has maximum sum -2.
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can the input array contain a single element?**
   - Yes, the problem statement mentions a non-empty subarray, so single elements are allowed.

2. **Can the array contain all negative numbers?**
   - Yes, similar to Example 3.

3. **Is the output constrained by any limits (e.g., large integers)?**
   - No, the problem does not specify constraints that we need to adjust for large integers.

### Strategy:
1. **Straight Maximum Subarray Sum**: Apply Kadane's Algorithm to find the maximum sum of a subarray in the non-circular setup.
2. **Circular Maximum Subarray Sum**: 
   - Compute the total sum of the array.
   - Use Kadaneâ€™s algorithm to find the minimum sum subarray then subtract it from the total sum to get the maximum sum of the circular subarray.
3. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where all numbers are negative separately, since the above method might not handle this properly.

The final result will be the maximum of:
- The straight maximum subarray sum.
- The circular maximum subarray sum unless it results in `0` (which means all elements were negative).

### Code:
```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxSubarraySumCircular(int[] nums) {
        int total = 0, maxSum = nums[0], curMax = 0, minSum = nums[0], curMin = 0;
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            curMax = Math.max(curMax + num, num);
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, curMax);
            
            curMin = Math.min(curMin + num, num);
            minSum = Math.min(minSum, curMin);
            
            total += num;
        }
        
        // If all numbers are negative, maxSum is the final answer
        return maxSum > 0 ? Math.max(maxSum, total - minSum) : maxSum;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- The solution iterates through the array a constant number of times (once).
  - Calculating the total sum: `O(n)`
  - Applying Kadane's algorithm for both maximum and minimum subarrays: `O(n)`
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is `O(1)` since we're only using a fixed number of variables for calculations.

By following this strategy and code implementation, we can efficiently solve the problem of finding the maximum sum of a circular subarray.
