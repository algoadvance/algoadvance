[Leetcode 2406. Divide Intervals Into Minimum Number of Groups](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2406)
### Problem Statement

Given a list of intervals representing different tasks, you need to divide these intervals into the minimum number of groups such that no two intervals in the same group overlap.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the interval values?**
   - Generally, this should be clarified, but we'll assume typical interval values within the bounds of standard integer ranges unless otherwise specified.

2. **What should be the return type?**
   - The problem requires us to return the minimum number of groups needed.

3. **Can the intervals be empty?**
   - We assume that the list of intervals can be non-empty for the purpose of the problem.

4. **How large can the list of intervals be?**
   - Typically, this should fit within memory constraints, but weâ€™ll assume at most up to 10^5 intervals.

5. **Are the intervals guaranteed to be valid?**
   - Yes, we'll assume each interval is valid.

### Strategy

To find the minimum number of groups such that no two intervals in the same group overlap, we can leverage the concept of the "sweep line" algorithm or "meeting room" problem. Essentially, we:
1. Mark the start and end points of each interval.
2. Sort these events.
3. Use a counter to track the number of overlapping intervals at any given point in time.
4. The maximum value of this counter throughout the traversal will give us the number of groups needed.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class DivideIntervals {

    public int minGroups(int[][] intervals) {
        int n = intervals.length;
        int[] startPoints = new int[n];
        int[] endPoints = new int[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            startPoints[i] = intervals[i][0];
            endPoints[i] = intervals[i][1];
        }
        
        Arrays.sort(startPoints);
        Arrays.sort(endPoints);
        
        int startPointer = 0, endPointer = 0, groups = 0, maxGroups = 0;
        
        while (startPointer < n) {
            if (startPoints[startPointer] <= endPoints[endPointer]) {
                groups++;
                startPointer++;
                maxGroups = Math.max(maxGroups, groups);
            } else {
                groups--;
                endPointer++;
            }
        }
        
        return maxGroups;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DivideIntervals solution = new DivideIntervals();
        int[][] intervals = {{1, 3}, {2, 4}, {3, 5}};
        System.out.println(solution.minGroups(intervals)); // Output should be 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** We sort the start and end points of the intervals, each taking \(O(n \log n)\) time, where \(n\) is the number of intervals.
- **Traversal:** We perform a linear scan through the sorted start and end points, which takes \(O(n)\) time.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the solution is \(O(n \log n)\).

### Space Complexity

- We use additional arrays to store start and end points, resulting in \(O(n)\) space complexity for these arrays.
- Other variables used are only a constant space \(O(1)\).

Hence, the overall space complexity is \(O(n)\).
