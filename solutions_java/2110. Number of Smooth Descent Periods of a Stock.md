[Leetcode 2110. Number of Smooth Descent Periods of a Stock](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2110)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `prices` representing the daily price history of a stock. A smooth descent period is defined as one where the price decreases by exactly 1 each day.

More formally, a period of `k` consecutive days `[i, i+1, ..., i+k-1]` is called a smooth descent period if and only if `prices[j] - prices[j+1] = 1` for each `j` (`i <= j < i+k-1`).

Return the number of smooth descent periods.

### Example
```
Input: prices = [3, 2, 1, 4]
Output: 5
Explanation: There are 5 smooth descent periods:
[3], [2], [1], [3, 2], [2, 1]
Note that a period like [3, 4] is not a smooth descent period because 3 - 4 != 1.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can I assume the input array is non-empty?
   - Answer: Yes, you may assume the input array is non-empty.
2. Are there any constraints on the size of the array or the values within?
   - Answer: The array length is up to 10^5, and each element can take any integer value.

## Strategy
The goal is to count all the smooth descent periods. We can do this by iterating through the array and checking if each pair of consecutive elements satisfies the condition. We can use a variable to keep track of the current length of a smooth descent period and use it to count the number of periods.

Here's a step-by-step outline of the approach:
1. Initialize `total_periods` to count the total number of smooth descent periods.
2. Initialize a variable `current_length` to keep track of the current length of a smooth descent period.
3. Iterate through the array starting from the second element:
   - If the current element and the previous element constitute a descent (i.e., `prices[i-1] - prices[i] == 1`), increment `current_length`.
   - Otherwise, reset `current_length` to 1 as each element itself is a descent period.
4. Add the value of `current_length` to `total_periods` at each step, since every extension of the descent period also adds multiple new smooth descent periods.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public long getDescentPeriods(int[] prices) {
        long totalPeriods = 0;
        int currentLength = 1; // Initial length for single day descent period
        
        for (int i = 1; i < prices.length; i++) {
            if (prices[i - 1] - prices[i] == 1) {
                currentLength++;
            } else {
                currentLength = 1;
            }
            totalPeriods += currentLength;
        }
        
        return totalPeriods + prices.length;  // Adding single day periods
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] prices = {3, 2, 1, 4};
        System.out.println(sol.getDescentPeriods(prices));  // Output: 5
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity for this solution is **O(n)**, where **n** is the length of the `prices` array. This is because we are iterating through the array once, processing each element in constant time.

The space complexity is **O(1)** since we are only using a few additional variables, and our solution does not depend on the size of the input array.
