[Leetcode 1655. Distribute Repeating Integers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1655)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. We want to distribute these integers to exactly `k` people such that each person receives at least one integer and the integers each person receives are unique (i.e., the same integer cannot be given to the same person twice).

Return `true` if it is possible to distribute the integers in this way, otherwise return `false`.

### Example:

- **Example 1:**
    ```plaintext
    Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 3
    Output: false
    ```
    
- **Example 2:**
    ```plaintext
    Input: nums = [3,2,1,2,3,3], k = 2
    Output: true
    ```


## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the array have negative numbers?**
   - No, the array consists of positive integers only.
   
2. **Is it guaranteed that `k` will be less than or equal to the length of the array?**
   - No such guarantee, so we should handle cases where `k` is greater than the length of the array (which would result in an automatic return of `false`).

3. **What is the expected time complexity?**
   - The solution should be efficient, ideally better than a brute-force check which can be exponential due to the combinatorial nature of the problem.

## Strategy

To determine if we can distribute the integers properly, we need to consider the frequency of each number in the `nums` array:

1. **Frequency Calculation:** First, we calculate the frequency of each number.
2. **Feasibility Check:** To satisfy `k` people, we must ensure no person gets the same number twice, and each person gets at least one integer.
3. **Minimum Distribution:** For the highest frequency number, if the highest frequency `maxFreq` is more than `k`, we must ensure we can distribute enough integers from other frequencies to meet the demands.

We can use a backtracking approach to attempt distributing the integers or utilize a max-heap based greedy strategy to try and distribute the top frequencies first.

### Code Implementation

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public boolean canDistribute(int[] nums, int k) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> freqMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            freqMap.put(num, freqMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        // Convert frequencies to an array and sort them
        int[] frequencies = new int[freqMap.size()];
        int index = 0;
        for (int freq : freqMap.values()) {
            frequencies[index++] = freq;
        }
        
        // Sort in descending order
        Arrays.sort(frequencies);

        // Try to distribute using sorted frequencies
        return distribute(frequencies, k, frequencies.length - 1);
    }
    
    private boolean distribute(int[] frequencies, int k, int index) {
        if (k == 0) return true;
        if (index < 0) return false;
        
        // Try to use all items up to the current frequency
        for (int i = frequencies[index]; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (k - i >= 0) { // valid if you can still distribute k - i amounts
                if (distribute(frequencies, k - i, index - 1)) {
                    return true;
                }
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the above solution mostly relies on the recursive backtracking which is highly dependent on the value of `k` and the distribution pattern of the frequencies. The sorting of frequencies is `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of unique numbers in `nums`.

Overall complexity is tough to determine due to the backtracking but can be stated as a mix of `O(n log n)` for sorting and an exponential factor based on distribution attempts which in worst cases could approach `O(k^m)` where `m` is the unique frequency count.
