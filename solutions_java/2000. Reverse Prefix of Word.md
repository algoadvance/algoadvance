[Leetcode 2000. Reverse Prefix of Word full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2000)
### Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** string `word` and a character `ch`. Find the **first occurrence** of `ch` in `word`, and **reverse** the segment of `word` that starts at index `0` and ends at the index of the first occurrence (inclusive). If the character `ch` does not exist in `word`, return the original string.

### Example
- Input: `word = "abcdefd", ch = 'd'`
- Output: `"dcbaefd"`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the length of the `word` or the type of characters it can contain?
   **A:** `1 <= word.length <= 250`, `word` consists of only lowercase English letters, and `ch` is a lowercase English letter.

2. **Q:** What should be done if `ch` is not found in `word`?
   **A:** The original `word` should be returned.

3. **Q:** Should I consider the possibility of multiple occurrences of the character `ch`?
   **A:** Only the first occurrence of `ch` should be considered.

### Strategy

1. **Search for the character `ch`:**
   - Use the `indexOf` method to find the first occurrence of `ch` in the `word`.

2. **Reverse the segment:**
   - If `ch` is found, use string manipulation to reverse the substring from the start to the found index.
   - Concatenate the reversed substring with the remaining part of the string.

3. **Return the resultant string.**

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public String reversePrefix(String word, char ch) {
        int index = word.indexOf(ch);
        if (index == -1) {
            return word;
        }

        String prefix = new StringBuilder(word.substring(0, index + 1)).reverse().toString();
        String suffix = word.substring(index + 1);

        return prefix + suffix;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Index Search:** The `indexOf` method runs in O(n) time where `n` is the length of the string.
- **Substring and Reverse Operations:**
  - Extracting and reversing the substring both take O(k) time, where `k` is the length of the substring (from start to the first occurrence of `ch`).
  - Extracting the suffix takes O(n - k) time.

Overall, the time complexity for the operation is **O(n)**.

This strategy and implementation ensure that the solution is efficient and meets the problem constraints effectively.
