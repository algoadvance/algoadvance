[Leetcode 960. Delete Columns to Make Sorted III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l960)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of `n` strings `strs`, all of the same length. We may choose any deletion indices, and we delete all the characters in those indices for each string.

For example, if we have `strs = ["abcdef","uvwxyz"]` and deletion indices `{0, 2, 3}`, then the final array after deletions is `["bef", "vyz"]`.

Suppose we chose a set of deletion indices such that after deletions, `strs` is in lexicographic (alphabetical) order. Return the minimum possible value of such a set of deletion indices.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are all strings guaranteed to be the same length?**
   Yes, all strings in the input array are guaranteed to be of the same length.

2. **Is the ordering case-sensitive?**
   Yes, the ordering is case-sensitive, which means "A" < "a".

3. **What should be the returned value?**
   The returned value should be the minimum number of deletion indices required to make the array lexicographically sorted.

### Strategy
The problem is about finding the minimum number of columns to delete to ensure each row in the resulting list is sorted lexicographically. This can be viewed as finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) of columns when considering each character from each column.

1. **Transform the Problem:** Consider each column as a character in a sequence. We want to determine the longest subsequence of these characters such that each column, when viewed vertically, results in a lexicographically sorted order.

2. **Dynamic Programming Solution:**
   - Use a DP array where `dp[j]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at column `j`.
   - For each pair of columns `(i, j)`, if column `j` can follow column `i` without breaking the sorted order, we update `dp[j]`.

### Code
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int minDeletionSize(String[] strs) {
        int n = strs.length;
        int m = strs[0].length();

        int[] dp = new int[m];
        Arrays.fill(dp, 1);
        
        for (int j = 1; j < m; j++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < j; i++) {
                if (canFollow(strs, i, j)) {
                    dp[j] = Math.max(dp[j], dp[i] + 1);
                }
            }
        }

        int maxLen = Arrays.stream(dp).max().orElse(1);
        return m - maxLen;
    }
    
    private boolean canFollow(String[] strs, int i, int j) {
        for (String str : strs) {
            if (str.charAt(i) > str.charAt(j)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        String[] strs = {"babca","bbazb"};
        System.out.println(sol.minDeletionSize(strs));  // Output: 3
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **canFollow execution:** This function is called in the worst-case O(m^2 * n) times, where each call is O(n). Hence, the total complexity for this part is O(m^2 * n).
- **Overall complexity:** O(m^2 * n), where `m` is the length of each string and `n` is the number of strings.

By using dynamic programming, this solution efficiently finds the minimum deletions required to sort the columns, ensuring clarity and correctness.
