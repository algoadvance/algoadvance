[Leetcode 1768. Merge Strings Alternately](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1768)
## Problem Statement

Given two strings `word1` and `word2`, merge them by alternating the characters from `word1` and `word2`. If one string is longer than the other, append the additional characters to the end of the merged string.

For example:
- Input: `word1 = "abc"`, `word2 = "pqr"`
- Output: `"apbqcr"`

- Input: `word1 = "ab"`, `word2 = "pqrs"`
- Output: `"apbqrs"`

- Input: `word1 = "abcd"`, `word2 = "pq"`
- Output: `"apbqcd"`

Return the merged string.

## Clarifying Questions

Before we move forward, we might ask a few clarifying questions:
1. Can the inputs be empty strings? (Assume they can be)
2. Is there any constraint on the length of `word1` and `word2`? (Assume constraints as per typical strings in coding problems)

## Strategy

1. Initialize a `StringBuilder` to build the merged string.
2. Use two pointers, `i` for `word1` and `j` for `word2`, to iterate over the characters of the strings.
3. Alternate between characters from `word1` and `word2`:
   - Append character from `word1` if `i` is less than the length of `word1`.
   - Append character from `word2` if `j` is less than the length of `word2`.
4. Increment the respective pointer (`i` or `j`) after appending a character.
5. Once all characters from both `word1` and `word2` are processed, return the merged string.

## Code

```java
public class MergeStringsAlternately {
    public String mergeAlternately(String word1, String word2) {
        StringBuilder mergedString = new StringBuilder();
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        // Loop until both strings are processed
        while (i < word1.length() || j < word2.length()) {
            if (i < word1.length()) {
                mergedString.append(word1.charAt(i));
                i++;
            }
            if (j < word2.length()) {
                mergedString.append(word2.charAt(j));
                j++;
            }
        }
        return mergedString.toString();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MergeStringsAlternately merger = new MergeStringsAlternately();
        System.out.println(merger.mergeAlternately("abc", "pqr")); // Output: apbqcr
        System.out.println(merger.mergeAlternately("ab", "pqrs")); // Output: apbqrs
        System.out.println(merger.mergeAlternately("abcd", "pq")); // Output: apbqcd
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the algorithm is **O(n + m)**, where `n` is the length of `word1` and `m` is the length of `word2`. This is because we are iterating through each character of both strings exactly once.

The space complexity is also **O(n + m)**, considering the additional space used for building the final merged string stored in the `StringBuilder`.
