[Leetcode 1640. Check Array Formation Through Concatenation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1640)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of distinct integers `arr` and an array of integer arrays `pieces`, where the integers in `pieces` are distinct. Your goal is to form `arr` by concatenating the arrays in `pieces` in any order. However, you are only allowed to concatenate whole arrays in `pieces` and cannot reorder the integers within any individual piece array.

Return `True` if you can form the array `arr` from `pieces`. Otherwise, return `False`.

### Example:
```
Input: arr = [85], pieces = [[85]]
Output: true

Input: arr = [15,88], pieces = [[88],[15]]
Output: true

Input: arr = [49,18,16], pieces = [[16,18,49]]
Output: false

Input: arr = [91,4,64,78], pieces = [[78],[4,64],[91]]
Output: true
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= pieces.length <= arr.length <= 100`
- `sum(pieces[i].length) == arr.length`
- `1 <= arr[i], pieces[i][j] <= 100`
- The integers in `arr` are distinct.
- The integers in `pieces` are distinct (i.e., no integer is repeated).

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can each integer appear in both `arr` and `pieces` exactly once?**
   - Yes, the integers in `arr` and `pieces` are distinct and each integer will appear exactly once.

2. **Is there a specific order required for concatenating the arrays in `pieces`?**
   - Yes, when forming `arr`, the order must match exactly as in `arr`.

3. **Can pieces be concatenated in any order?**
   - Yes, as long as the final concatenated array must match `arr` in both values and order.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, follow these steps:

1. Create a hashmap (dictionary) where the key is the first element of each subarray in `pieces` and the value is the entire subarray.
2. Iterate through the `arr` and for each element, check if it is the starting element of any subarray in the hashmap.
3. If a match is found, compare the sequence of numbers starting from that index in `arr` with the subarray.
4. If all elements match in each corresponding position, move to the next subarray in `arr`.
5. If all elements in `arr` are matched successfully, return `True`. Else, return `False`.

## Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

class Solution {
    public boolean canFormArray(int[] arr, int[][] pieces) {
        HashMap<Integer, int[]> map = new HashMap<>();

        // Store each piece's first element as key and the piece itself as value
        for (int[] piece : pieces) {
            map.put(piece[0], piece);
        }

        int i = 0;
        while (i < arr.length) {
            // If arr[i] is not a starting number of any piece, return false
            if (!map.containsKey(arr[i])) {
                return false;
            }

            // Get the piece associated with arr[i]
            int[] piece = map.get(arr[i]);
            for (int j = 0; j < piece.length; j++) {
                // Check if the current sequence in arr matches with the piece
                if (arr[i] != piece[j]) {
                    return false;
                }
                i++; // Move to the next element in arr
            }
        }

        return true; // All elements matched
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **HashMap Construction**: O(n), where n is the total number of elements in `pieces`.
- **Array Traversal**: O(m), where m is the length of `arr`.

Overall, the time complexity is **O(n + m)**, which makes the solution efficient for the given constraints.

The space complexity is also minimal, mainly for the hashmap and the input array storage, which is **O(n)**.
