[Leetcode 2483. Minimum Penalty for a Shop](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2483)
### Problem Statement

You are given a shop schedule represented by a string `customers` where:
- `customers[i]` will be 'Y' if the shop is open and a customer comes in at hour `i`.
- `customers[i]` will be 'N' if the shop is open and no customer comes in at hour `i`.

You want to close the shop at an hour `k` such that the penalty for closing the shop is minimized. The penalty is calculated as follows:
- For each hour `i < k` when the shop is closed, a penalty of 1 is incurred for each 'Y' in the input string from `customers`.
- For each hour `i >= k` when the shop is open, a penalty of 1 is incurred for each 'N' in the input string from `customers`.

Return the hour `k` when the total penalty is minimized. It is guaranteed that there will be a unique answer.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the shop close at the very beginning (i.e., hour 0) and remain closed all the time?
2. Are there any constraints on the length of the `customers` string?
3. Can it be guaranteed that there is at least one 'Y' or 'N' in the string?

### Example

```
Input: customers = "YYNY"
Output: 2
Explanation: 
- If the shop closes at hour 2, the penalty is calculated as follows:
    - Before hour 2: penalty is 0 (no 'Y's before 2)
    - After hour 2: penalty is 0 (one 'N' from hour 2 to the end)
- Total penalty = 0 + 0 = 0 which is the minimum possible.
```

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to calculate the penalty for every hour `k`, and then find the hour `k` which gives the minimum penalty.

1. Initialize two counters, one to count the number of 'Y's and the other to count the number of 'N's.
2. Traverse through the string, updating the penalty based on whether current hour is before `k` or after `k`.
3. Track the minimum penalty observed and the corresponding hour `k`.

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int bestClosingTime(String customers) {
        int n = customers.length();
        int penalty = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int closingTime = 0;

        // Count of Y's up to the current hour
        int[] prefixY = new int[n + 1];
        // Count of N's from the current hour to the end
        int[] suffixN = new int[n + 1];

        // Build prefixY array
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            prefixY[i + 1] = prefixY[i] + (customers.charAt(i) == 'Y' ? 1 : 0);
        }

        // Build suffixN array
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            suffixN[i] = suffixN[i + 1] + (customers.charAt(i) == 'N' ? 1 : 0);
        }

        // Iterate through each hour to find the minimal penalty
        for (int k = 0; k <= n; k++) {
            int currentPenalty = (k == 0 ? 0 : prefixY[k - 1]) + suffixN[k];
            if (currentPenalty < penalty) {
                penalty = currentPenalty;
                closingTime = k;
            }
        }

        return closingTime;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - Building both `prefixY` and `suffixN` arrays takes O(n) time each.
  - Iterating through each hour to compute the penalties also takes O(n) time.

- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - We use additional space for `prefixY` and `suffixN` arrays, each being of size `n+1`.

This approach ensures we efficiently find the optimal hour `k` to close the shop, minimizing the penalty incurred.
