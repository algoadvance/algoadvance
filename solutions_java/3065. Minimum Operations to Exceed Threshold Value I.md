[Leetcode 3065. Minimum Operations to Exceed Threshold Value I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3065)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `arr` and two integers `threshold` and `maxOperations`.

In one operation, you can remove one element from `arr` and divide it into any numbers of new elements such that their sum is equal to the removed element. The goal is to perform the minimum number of operations such that the sum of the array exceeds `threshold`.

Return the minimum number of operations required. If it is impossible to achieve this, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints?**
   - What is the maximum length of the array `arr`?
   - What is the range of values for each element in `arr`, `threshold`, and `maxOperations`?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What if `arr` is empty?
   - What if the `threshold` is less than or equal to the sum of `arr` already?
   - What happens if `maxOperations` is 0?

### Strategy

1. **Initial Check:**
   - Calculate the initial sum of `arr`.
   - If this sum is already greater than or equal to `threshold`, return 0 since no operations are necessary.

2. **Priority Queue (Max-Heap):**
   - Use a max-heap to always choose the maximum element to split.
   - The reason is that splitting a larger element contributes more towards increasing the total number of elements and thus their sum.

3. **Operations:**
   - Perform operations iteratively, replacing the maximum heap element with its divided parts.
   - Track the number of operations performed.

4. **Early termination:**
   - If at any point the sum exceeds or meets `threshold`, return the number of operations performed.

5. **Edge Case Handling:**
   - If we exhaust `maxOperations` and still haven't met the threshold, return -1.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public class MinOperationsToExceedThreshold {

    public int minOperations(int[] arr, int threshold, int maxOperations) {
        long sum = 0;
        for (int num : arr) {
            sum += num;
        }

        if (sum >= threshold) {
            return 0;
        }

        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        for (int num : arr) {
            maxHeap.add(num);
        }

        int operations = 0;
        while (operations < maxOperations && sum < threshold && !maxHeap.isEmpty()) {
            int maxElement = maxHeap.poll();
            // Since we are dividing maxElement into 2 parts, we create two new elements.
            int newElement1 = maxElement / 2;
            int newElement2 = maxElement - newElement1;

            sum = sum - maxElement + newElement1 + newElement2;

            maxHeap.add(newElement1);
            maxHeap.add(newElement2);

            operations++;
        }

        return sum >= threshold ? operations : -1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinOperationsToExceedThreshold solver = new MinOperationsToExceedThreshold();
        int[] arr = {10, 20, 30};
        int threshold = 60;
        int maxOperations = 3;
        System.out.println(solver.minOperations(arr, threshold, maxOperations)); // Output: 1
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initial Sum Calculation:** O(n), where `n` is the length of `arr`.
- **Heap Operations:**
  - Each insertion or deletion in a heap costs O(log n).
  - We may need to perform up to `maxOperations` operations.
- Thus, the overall worst-case time complexity is O(n + maxOperations * log n).

The solution is efficient given realistic constraints and handles several edge cases appropriately.
