[Leetcode 1162. As Far from Land as Possible](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1162)
## Problem Statement

You are a map designer for a game, and you need to ensure that some land cells are as far from water cells as possible. You are given an `n x n` grid `grid`, where:
- `grid[i][j] == 0` represents a water cell.
- `grid[i][j] == 1` represents a land cell.

You need to find a water cell such that its distance to the nearest land cell is maximized and return this distance. If no land or water exists in the grid, return `-1`.

The distance used in this problem is the Manhattan distance: the distance between two cells `(x0, y0)` and `(x1, y1)` is `|x0 - x1| + |y0 - y1|`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the grid size?**
    - It is a square grid with size `n x n`, where `n` can range from `1` to `100`.

2. **Can there be cases where there is no land or no water?**
    - Yes, and in such cases, the function should return `-1`.

3. **What is the range of values for the grid entries?**
    - Each cell in the input grid will either be `0` (water) or `1` (land).

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a multi-source Breadth-First Search (BFS):

1. **Add all land cells (1s) to the queue**: These will function as sources for our BFS.
2. **Perform BFS from all land cells at once**:
    - Starting from each land cell simultaneously, explore all four possible directions (up, down, left, right).
    - Update the water cells (0s) to the distance from the nearest land cell.
    - Track the maximum distance found from the nearest land during this process.
3. If after BFS, we find that no water cell was updated, return `-1`.

This approach ensures we find the furthest distance from any land cell to the nearest water cell efficiently using BFS.

## Code

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

public class AsFarFromLandAsPossible {
    public int maxDistance(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        
        // Add all land cells to the queue
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    queue.offer(new int[]{i, j});
                }
            }
        }
        
        // If there's no land or water return -1
        if (queue.isEmpty() || queue.size() == n * n) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        // Perform BFS from all land cells
        int[] dirX = {0, 1, 0, -1}; // directions array for row adjustments
        int[] dirY = {1, 0, -1, 0}; // directions array for column adjustments
        int maxDistance = -1;
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] cell = queue.poll();
            int x = cell[0];
            int y = cell[1];
            
            // Explore in all 4 directions
            for (int k = 0; k < 4; k++) {
                int newX = x + dirX[k];
                int newY = y + dirY[k];
                
                // If it's inside the grid and it's a water cell
                if (newX >= 0 && newY >= 0 && newX < n && newY < n && grid[newX][newY] == 0) {
                    // Update the distance for water cell and mark it visited by changing to 1 or any other non-zero
                    grid[newX][newY] = grid[x][y] + 1;
                    maxDistance = Math.max(maxDistance, grid[newX][newY] - 1);
                    queue.offer(new int[]{newX, newY});
                }
            }
        }
        
        return maxDistance;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AsFarFromLandAsPossible solver = new AsFarFromLandAsPossible();
        int[][] grid = {
            {1, 0, 1},
            {0, 0, 0},
            {1, 0, 1}
        };
        System.out.println(solver.maxDistance(grid));  // Output: 2
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n^2)`, where `n` is the dimension of the grid. This is because in the worst case, we visit every cell in the grid exactly once during the BFS traversal.

The space complexity is also `O(n^2)` due to the additional space required for the queue and the storage of grid configuration.
