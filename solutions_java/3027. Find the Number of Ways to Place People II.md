[Leetcode 3027. Find the Number of Ways to Place People II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3027)
### Problem Statement

Given a number `n`, there are `2*n` people standing in a line. We want to divide them into two lines such that each person in the first line is taller than the corresponding person in the second line.

Your task is to find the number of ways to place these `2*n` people into two lines satisfying the above condition.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can there be any duplicate heights among the `2*n` people?**
   - No, all the people have distinct heights.
   
2. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - The problem constraints are not specified in the snippet you provided, so we'll assume typical constraints unless stated otherwise.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. Hereâ€™s the plan:

1. **Sort** the heights of the `2*n` people in ascending order.
2. **Divide** the sorted list into two parts: the first `n` elements will form the first line and the remaining `n` elements will form the second line.
3. We need to ensure that the arrangement satisfies the condition where every person in the first line is taller than the corresponding person in the second line.
4. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Define `dp[i][j]` as the number of ways to place the first `i+j` people into `i` positions of the first line and `j` positions of the second line satisfying the given condition.
   - Use a **2D table** to compute these values.

### Dynamic Programming Formula

For the DP table:
- `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]` if the `i-th` person can be placed in the first line.
- `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1]` if the `j-th` person can be placed in the second line.

Base case:
- `dp[0][0] = 1`: There's exactly one way to arrange zero people.

However, before diving into the DP tabulation, the cross-cut checks and tabulations need to be monitored strictly, ensuring each person in the first line is taller than persons in the second line.

### Code

Let's implement the solution in Java:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class PlacePeople {

    public static int numberOfWays(int[] heights) {
        int n = heights.length / 2;
        
        // Sort the heights array
        Arrays.sort(heights);
        
        int[][] dp = new int[n+1][n+1];
        dp[0][0] = 1;

        // Build the DP table
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
                if (i > 0 && heights[i-1] < heights[n + j - 1]) {
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i-1][j];
                }
                if (j > 0) {
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i][j-1];
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[n][n];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] heights = {1, 3, 2, 6, 4, 5}; // Case example
        System.out.println(numberOfWays(heights)); // Outputs the number of ways
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting** the array takes `O(n log n)`.
- Building the `dp` table requires `O(n^2)` operations.

Thus, the total time complexity is `O(n log n + n^2)`. This should be efficient for reasonable values of `n`.

### Space Complexity

- The DP table requires `O(n^2)` space.

The solution ensures both time and space efficiency while adhering to the constraints given in the problem statement.
