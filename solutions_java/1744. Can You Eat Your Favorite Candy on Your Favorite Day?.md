[Leetcode 1744. Can You Eat Your Favorite Candy on Your Favorite Day?](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1744)
### Problem Statement

You are given a **non-negative integer array** `candiesCount` where `candiesCount[i]` represents the number of candies of type `i` that you have. You are also given a 2D array `queries` where `queries[i] = [favoriteType_i, favoriteDay_i, dailyCap_i]`. You want to know whether you can eat **at least one** candy of type `favoriteType_i` on day `favoriteDay_i` without breaking the rules:
- You must eat exactly **one candy per day** until you eat the candy of type `favoriteType_i`.
- You should start eating candies from day 0, consuming candies in the order they are given in `candiesCount`.
- You may not skip any day of eating candies.
- You can eat candies of different types on different days depending on the `dailyCap_i`.

Return a boolean array `result` where `result[i]` is true if you can eat a candy of type `favoriteType_i` on `favoriteDay_i`; otherwise false.

### Clarifying Questions

Before moving to the solution, let's clarify a few points:
1. What is the maximum length for `candiesCount` and `queries`? This helps to understand potential performance concerns.
2. Are there constraints on the values within `candiesCount` or `queries` (e.g., maximum daily cap)?

For the sake of this solution, let's assume reasonable constraints for a typical competitive programming question.

### Strategy

1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Calculate the prefix sum of the `candiesCount` array to get the total number of candies up to each type.
2. **Query Processing**: For each query in `queries`, determine the range of possible days you could eat a candy of the given type based on the `dailyCap_i`.
3. **Boolean Check**: Check if `favoriteDay_i` falls within the calculated range.

### Strategy Explanation

- Assume you start eating candies from day 0.
- Use `prefixSum[i]` to get the total number of candies up to and including type i-1.
- For each query, derive the earliest and latest day you can reach the `favoriteType_i` type:
  - The earliest day you can start eating the `favoriteType_i` candies is governed by the total candies of previous types.
  - The latest day is influenced by the daily cap multiplied by the number of days.

### Time Complexity

- Calculating the prefix sum is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of candy types.
- Each query can be answered in constant time, `O(1)`.

### Code

Here's how the implementation looks in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean[] canEat(int[] candiesCount, int[][] queries) {
        int n = candiesCount.length;
        long[] prefixSum = new long[n];
        
        // Calculate the prefix sum
        prefixSum[0] = candiesCount[0];
        for (int i = 1; i < n; ++i) {
            prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i - 1] + candiesCount[i];
        }
        
        int m = queries.length;
        boolean[] result = new boolean[m];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; ++i) {
            int favoriteType = queries[i][0];
            int favoriteDay = queries[i][1];
            int dailyCap = queries[i][2];
            
            long x1 = favoriteDay + 1;
            long y1 = (long) (favoriteDay + 1) * dailyCap;
            long x2 = favoriteType == 0 ? 1 : prefixSum[favoriteType - 1] + 1;
            long y2 = prefixSum[favoriteType];
            
            result[i] = !(x1 > y2 || y1 < x2);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: We calculate the running total of candies up to each type.
2. **Logic to Determine Valid Days**:
   - `x1` represents the earliest day you could eat the favorite candy.
   - `y1` represents the latest day you could start eating the favorite candy and still have one on the favorite day.
   - `x2` and `y2` provide the range of days you will still have candies of the previous types available.
   - The condition `!(x1 > y2 || y1 < x2)` checks for the overlap.

This solution ensures that we can quickly and efficiently determine if a given query is feasible.
