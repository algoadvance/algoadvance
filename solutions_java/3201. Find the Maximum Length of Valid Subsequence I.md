[Leetcode 3201. Find the Maximum Length of Valid Subsequence I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3201)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` and a string `t`. You need to find the maximum length of a subsequence in `s` that is also a subsequence in `t`.

- A subsequence is derived by deleting some or no characters from the original string without changing the order of the remaining characters.
- Output the length of the longest subsequence in `s` that is also a subsequence in `t`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are both `s` and `t` guaranteed to be non-empty strings?
2. What is the maximum length of `s` and `t`?
3. Can `s` and `t` contain any characters, including special characters and spaces?
4. Should the subsequence in `s` be a contiguous segment of characters?

Assuming standard constraints of string lengths being up to 1000 characters and they consist of alphanumeric characters, as is typical in such problems.

## Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**: 
    - We'll use a 2D dynamic programming (DP) table to store the lengths of longest common subsequences.
    - Let `dp[i][j]` represent the length of the longest common subsequence of `s[0…i-1]` and `t[0…j-1]`.
    - Initialize a 2D list `dp` with dimensions `(len(s)+1) x (len(t)+1)` and fill it with zeros.
    
2. **Filling the DP Table**:
    - If `s[i-1] == t[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1` because we can extend the subsequence found so far by 1.
    - Else, `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`. This represents the case where either we can ignore the current character of `s` or `t`.

3. **Result Extraction**:
    - The length of the longest valid subsequence will be found at `dp[len(s)][len(t)]`.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxLengthValidSubsequence(String s, String t) {
        int lenS = s.length();
        int lenT = t.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[lenS + 1][lenT + 1];
        
        // Populate the DP table
        for (int i = 1; i <= lenS; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= lenT; j++) {
                if (s.charAt(i-1) == t.charAt(j-1)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // The answer is in dp[lenS][lenT]
        return dp[lenS][lenT];
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n)
  - Where `m` is the length of `s` and `n` is the length of `t`.
  - We iterate through each character in both strings, resulting in a nested loop over `m` and `n`.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n)
  - A 2D DP array of size `(m + 1) x (n + 1)` is used to store the intermediate results.

Feel free to ask any further questions or to provide additional constraints to refine the solution!
