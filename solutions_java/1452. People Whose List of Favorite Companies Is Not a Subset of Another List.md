[Leetcode 1452. People Whose List of Favorite Companies Is Not a Subset of Another List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1452)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array `favoriteCompanies` where `favoriteCompanies[i]` is the list of favorites companies for the `i-th` person (indexed from 0). Determine the people whose list of favorite companies is not a subset of another list of favorite companies. You should return the indices of these people in any order.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format**: 
   - Is it given that `favoriteCompanies` is a list of lists of strings?
   - Is there a limit on the size of `favoriteCompanies` and the length of individual lists?

2. **Output Format**:
   - Should the result be returned as a list of indices?

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - Is an empty list of favorite companies a valid input?
   - Can some individuals have the same lists of favorite companies?

### Strategy
1. **Uniqueness Check**: For each person, verify if their list of favorite companies is not a subset of any other person's list.
2. **Subset Verification**: Convert lists to sets for each person to easily check if one set is a subset of another.
3. **Multiple Comparisons**: Compare each person’s set with every other person’s set and determine if it is a subset.

### Steps to implement:
1. Iterate over each person’s favorite companies list.
2. For each person, compare their set of favorite companies with all other persons' sets.
3. If the set is found to be a subset of any other person’s set, mark that person’s index to exclude it.
4. Collect all the indices that are not marked as a subset for the result.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity primarily depends on the nested comparisons between the lists and converting lists to sets:
- Converting a list to a set takes O(k), where k is the size of the list.
- Comparing sets can take up to O(k1) where k1 is the size of the smaller set.
- Overall, for n people, the time complexity would approximately be O(n^2 * k) in the worst case.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> peopleIndexes(List<List<String>> favoriteCompanies) {
        int n = favoriteCompanies.size();
        List<Set<String>> companySets = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Convert each list of companies to a set for easy subset checking.
        for (List<String> list : favoriteCompanies) {
            companySets.add(new HashSet<>(list));
        }
        
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            boolean isSubset = false;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; ++j) {
                if (i != j && companySets.get(j).containsAll(companySets.get(i))) {
                    isSubset = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!isSubset) {
                result.add(i);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Conversion to Sets**: The code first converts each list of favorite companies to a `HashSet` to allow for efficient subset checking.
2. **Nested Loops for Comparison**: It uses nested loops to check if any person's set of favorite companies is a subset of any other person's set.
3. **Result Collection**: If a person's set is not a subset of any other, their index is added to the result list.
