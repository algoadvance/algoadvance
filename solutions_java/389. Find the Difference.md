[Leetcode 389. Find the Difference](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l389)
## Problem Statement:

You are given two strings `s` and `t`. String `t` is generated by random shuffling string `s` and then adding one more letter at a random position. 

Return the letter that was added to `t`.

Example:

```
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
```

## Clarifying Questions:

1. Are the strings `s` and `t` always non-empty?
   - Yes, `s` and `t` are non-empty strings, with `t` having exactly one more character than `s`.

2. Are there any constraints on the characters within the strings?
   - Both strings only contain lowercase English letters.

3. Is there always exactly one additional character in `t` than in `s`?
   - Yes, `t` will always have exactly one more character than `s`.

## Strategy:

### Approach 1: Using Character Frequency Counting
1. Initialize an empty array `count` of size 26 to store the frequencies of each letter (`a` to `z`).
2. Iterate over the string `s` and decrement the frequency count for each character found in `s`.
3. Iterate over the string `t` and increment the frequency count for each character found in `t`.
4. Traverse the `count` array to find the character with a count of 1, which is the additional character in `t`.

### Approach 2: Using XOR Bit Manipulation
1. Initialize a variable `charCode` to 0.
2. XOR all the characters of `s` and `t`. Due to the properties of XOR, characters that appear twice will cancel out and only the additional character will remain in `charCode`.
3. Convert `charCode` to the corresponding character.

We'll go with Approach 2 since it is more efficient and elegant.

## Code:

```java
public class Solution {
    public char findTheDifference(String s, String t) {
        int charCode = 0;
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            charCode ^= c;
        }
        
        for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
            charCode ^= c;
        }
        
        return (char) charCode;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) where n is the length of string `s`. We process each character in string `s` and `t` once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) as we are using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of input size.
