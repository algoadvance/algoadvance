[Leetcode 1227. Airplane Seat Assignment Probability](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1227)
### Problem Statement
A flight has `n` passengers and `n` seats arranged in a single row. Each passenger has a ticket for a specific seat. Unfortunately, the first passenger loses their ticket and picks a seat randomly. However, every subsequent passenger:
- Sits in their assigned seat if it is available.
- Picks a random available seat if their assigned seat is already taken.

Return the probability that the `n-th` (last) passenger sits in their assigned seat.

### Clarifying Questions
Before jumping into the solution, let's clarify a few aspects:
1. Is `n` guaranteed to be a positive integer? 
   - Yes, `n` is guaranteed to be a positive integer.
2. Are there any assumptions on the randomness of the seat selection?
   - Yes, the seat selection is uniformly random.
3. What is the value of `n` range?
   - Typically, `1 <= n <= 10^9`.

### Strategy
The problem is understood more intuitively through a recursive or combinatorial argument:
- If there is only one passenger (`n = 1`), the probability is `1` since the passenger will sit in the only seat available.
  
- Starting from the 2nd passenger to the last:
  - If the first passenger sits on their assigned seat (probability \(1/n\)), every other passenger including the `n-th` will sit in their assigned seats, so the probability is `1`.
  - If the first passenger sits on the `n-th` seat (probability \(1/n\)), the `n-th` passenger cannot sit in their assigned seat, so the probability is `0`.
  - For other seats (probability \( (n-2)/n \)), the problem reduces to a smaller sub-problem with remaining `n-1` seats.

The key observation is: after evaluating several scenarios, the probability converges to `1/2` for any n > 1. This uniform convergence is critical and simplifies the solution drastically.

### Code
Here's the concise implementation in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public double nthPersonGetsNthSeat(int n) {
        // For n == 1, the probability is 1.
        // For n > 1, as derived, the probability is 0.5.
        if (n == 1) {
            return 1.0;
        } else {
            return 0.5;
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(1), since the solution only involves a simple conditional check.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as no additional space is required beyond a few variables.

This solution leverages the insights from theoretical probability and converges to a straightforward implementation.
