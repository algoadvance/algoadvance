[Leetcode 977. Squares of a Sorted Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l977)
## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order, return an array of the squares of each number sorted in non-decreasing order.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [-4,-1,0,3,10]
Output: [0,1,9,16,100]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [-7,-3,2,3,11]
Output: [4,9,9,49,121]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the input array contain duplicate numbers?
   **A:** Yes, the input array can contain duplicates.
  
2. **Q:** What is the range of the input array size?
   **A:** The problem doesn't specify ranges, but typically LeetCode problems should handle sizes up to tens of thousands efficiently.

3. **Q:** Can we use extra space for memory?
   **A:** Yes, there is no constraint against using extra space.

4. **Q:** Should the algorithm handle negative numbers?
   **A:** Definitely, the example contains negative numbers.

## Strategy
Given the input array `nums` sorted in non-decreasing order:
1. We need to create an array of the squares of the numbers in `nums`.
2. Since squaring each number would change the relative order due to the absolute values, we must sort the squared values.

We can utilize a two-pointer approach since we know that the largest squares might be found:
- At the beginning of the array (most negative values).
- At the end of the array (largest positive values or least negative values).

### Two-pointer Approach Steps:
1. Initialize two pointers, `left` at the start of the array and `right` at the end of the array.
2. Create a result array with the same length as `nums`.
3. Iterate from the end of the result array to the beginning:
   - Compare the absolute values of the elements at `left` and `right`.
   - Place the square of the larger absolute value at the current position in the result array.
   - Move the corresponding pointer (`left` or `right`) inward.
4. Continue until the result array is fully populated.

This strategy ensures we fill the result array from the largest to the smallest value, essentially performing an efficient sort.

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`, since we make a single pass through `nums`.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for the result array.

## Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] sortedSquares(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] result = new int[n];
        int left = 0, right = n - 1;
        int pos = n - 1;

        while (left <= right) {
            int leftVal = nums[left] * nums[left];
            int rightVal = nums[right] * nums[right];

            if (leftVal > rightVal) {
                result[pos] = leftVal;
                left++;
            } else {
                result[pos] = rightVal;
                right--;
            }
            pos--;
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

This implementation maintains optimal efficiency in terms of both time and space, ensuring that the problem constraints and requirements are effectively met.
