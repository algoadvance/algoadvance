[Leetcode 3080. Mark Elements on Array by Performing Queries](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3080)
### Problem Statement

You're given an integer array `arr` of size `n` and a list of `m` queries. Each query is represented by a two-element list `[L, R]`, where `L` and `R` are 0-indexed and represent the range boundaries. For each query, you need to mark all elements in the range `[L, R]` in the array. The elements should be marked by replacing them with `1`.

Your task is to return the array after performing all queries.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all elements in the array initially set to 0?**
   - Yes, all elements in the array `arr` are initially set to 0.

2. **Can `L` and `R` be outside the bounds of the array?**
   - No, `L` and `R` are guaranteed to be valid indices within the array.

3. **Can `L` be greater than `R`?**
   - No, it is guaranteed that `L <= R` for each query.

4. **Can the array `arr` be empty or the list of queries be empty?**
   - For simplicity, assume the array `arr` will not be empty, and there can be zero or more queries.

### Strategy

We can achieve the task efficiently using a difference array approach. This involves using an auxiliary array to keep track of the increment operations at the boundaries and then computing the prefix sum to get the final array values. Here are the detailed steps:

1. **Initialization:** 
   - Create an auxiliary array `diff` of the same length as `arr` and initialize it with zeros.

2. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query [L, R], increment `diff[L]` by 1 and decrement `diff[R + 1]` by 1 if `R + 1` is within bounds. 

3. **Building the Final Array:**
   - Use the prefix sum on the `diff` array to build the resulting array `arr`.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] markArray(int[] arr, int[][] queries) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int[] diff = new int[n + 1];
        
        // Apply the difference array technique
        for (int[] q : queries) {
            int L = q[0];
            int R = q[1];
            diff[L] += 1;
            if (R + 1 < n) {
                diff[R + 1] -= 1;
            }
        }
        
        // Construct the final array using prefix sum on the difference array
        int currentMark = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            currentMark += diff[i];
            arr[i] = currentMark > 0 ? 1 : 0;
        }
        
        return arr;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization of the diff array:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array.
- **Processing each query:** `O(m)`, where `m` is the number of queries.
- **Building the final array:** `O(n)` using the prefix sum.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n + m)`. This is efficient compared to a naive approach that would involve processing each query across its entire range which could be `O(m * n)` in the worst case.

This solution ensures that the array is marked correctly by efficiently managing the range increments using the difference array technique.
