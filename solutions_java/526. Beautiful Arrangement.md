[Leetcode 526. Beautiful Arrangement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l526)
### Problem Statement

The problem is defined as follows:

Suppose you have `n` integers from `1` to `n`. We define a "beautiful arrangement" as an arrangement where for every `i-th` position `1 <= i <= n`, either of the following is true:
- The number at the `i-th` position is divisible by `i`.
- `i` is divisible by the number at the `i-th` position.

Given an integer `n`, return the count of the beautiful arrangements that you can form.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the range of `n`?
    - Can `n` be negative or zero?
  
   **Response**: Assume `n` is a positive integer and `1 <= n <= 15`.

2. **Output**:
    - Is the output just the count of beautiful arrangements for given `n`?
    
   **Response**: Yes, the output should be the count of beautiful arrangements.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use backtracking to generate all possible permutations of the integers from `1` to `n` and count the permutations that satisfy the problem's conditions.

#### Steps:

1. **Backtracking Approach**:
    - Use a boolean array to keep track of the visited numbers.
    - Recursively try placing each number `1` to `n` in positions `1` to `n`.
    - At each step, check if the current number can be placed in the current position based on the given conditions.
    - If the conditions are satisfied, recursively place the next number.
    - If all numbers are placed satisfying the conditions, increment the count of beautiful arrangements.

2. **Termination Condition**:
    - When we've placed all numbers successfully, increment the result count.

3. **Optimization**:
    - Since we only care about valid arrangements, we can prune branches early where it is impossible to place a number.

### Code

Here is the Java code implementing the above strategy:

```java
public class Solution {
    
    private int count = 0;
    
    public int countArrangement(int n) {
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n + 1];
        backtrack(1, n, visited);
        return count;
    }
    
    private void backtrack(int position, int n, boolean[] visited) {
        if (position > n) {
            count++;
            return;
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (!visited[i] && (i % position == 0 || position % i == 0)) {
                visited[i] = true;
                backtrack(position + 1, n, visited);
                visited[i] = false;
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.countArrangement(2)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**:
  - The algorithm will explore all the permutations of `n` numbers. In the worst case, this is `O(n!)` where `n` is the number of integers. 
  - Each permutation needs to be checked whether it is a beautiful arrangement which takes `O(n)` time. Hence the overall time complexity is `O(n! * n)` for large `n`.

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity is mainly due to the recursion stack and the `visited` array.
  - The recursion stack can go as deep as `n` and the `visited` array takes `O(n)` space.
  - Therefore, the space complexity is `O(n)`.
