[Leetcode 1009. Complement of Base 10 Integer](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1009)
## Problem Statement
Leetcode Problem 1009: Complement of Base 10 Integer

Given a positive integer `n`, you need to find the complement of its binary representation. The complement strategy is to flip the bits of its binary representation.

Example 1:
- Input: `n = 5`
- Output: `2`
- Explanation: The binary representation of `5` is `101`, and its complement is `010`, which is `2` in base-10.

Example 2:
- Input: `n = 1`
- Output: `0`
- Explanation: The binary representation of `1` is `1`, and its complement is `0`, which is `0` in base-10.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Is the input always a non-negative integer?
   - Yes, the input is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.
2. What should be returned if the input is `0`?
   - The complement of `0` is `1`, according to the description of bit flipping.
3. Are there any constraints on the size of `n`?
   - Typically, `n` will be within the bounds of a 32-bit signed integer.

## Strategy
1. **Find the Binary Representation**: Convert the integer `n` into its binary form.
2. **Generate Full Binary Mask**: Create a mask with all bits set based on the length of the binary representation of `n`.
3. **Compute the Complement**: XOR the integer with this mask to flip all the bits.
4. **Return the Result**: Convert the result back to a base-10 integer if needed (in Java, this will already be a base-10 integer).

### Step-by-Step Plan
1. Determine the length of the binary representation of `n`.
2. Compute a mask with all bits set to `1` for the length of the binary representation.
3. Use the XOR operator to flip the bits.
4. Output the decimal representation of the result.

## Code

```java
public class ComplementBase10Integer {
    public int bitwiseComplement(int n) {
        // Edge case: when n is 0, the complement is 1
        if (n == 0) return 1;
        
        // Determine the bit length of n
        int bitLength = Integer.toBinaryString(n).length();
        
        // Create a mask of the same length with all bits set to 1
        int mask = (1 << bitLength) - 1;
        
        // XOR n with the mask to get the complement
        int complement = n ^ mask;
        
        return complement;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ComplementBase10Integer solution = new ComplementBase10Integer();
        
        System.out.println(solution.bitwiseComplement(5));  // Output: 2
        System.out.println(solution.bitwiseComplement(1));  // Output: 0
        System.out.println(solution.bitwiseComplement(0));  // Output: 1
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because:
1. The operations to find the length of the binary string and create the bit mask are constant-time operations.
2. XOR operation is also a constant-time operation.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(1).
