[Leetcode 2390. Removing Stars From a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2390)
### Problem Statement
Leetcode Problem 2390: Removing Stars From a String

*You are given a string `s`, which contains stars `*`.

In one operation, you can:
- Choose a star in `s`.
- Remove the closest non-star character to its left, as well as remove the star itself.

Return the string after all stars have been removed.*

### Example
**Input**: `s = "leet**cod*e"`
**Output**: `leetcode`

**Input**: `s = "erase*****"`
**Output**: `""`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the string contain only stars or characters without stars?**
   - Yes, the input can be either scenario, and the function should handle it.
  
2. **Are there any constraints on the length of the string?**
   - Typical constraints from Leetcode, where `s` might be up to 100,000 characters long.
  
3. **What should be done if a star does not have a non-star character to its left?**
   - Each star will always have a preceding non-star character as per the problem statement.

### Strategy
To solve the problem efficiently, we can use a stack data structure to handle the removal of characters and stars. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Initialize an empty stack.
2. Traverse each character of the string:
   - If the character is not a star, push it onto the stack.
   - If the character is a star, pop the last character from the stack (since this is the closest non-star character to the left).
3. After processing all characters, the stack will contain the final resultant string. Convert the stack to a string and return it.

This approach ensures we handle all star removals efficiently with a linear time complexity.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public String removeStars(String s) {
        // Using StringBuilder as a stack for our resulting characters.
        StringBuilder stack = new StringBuilder();
        
        // Traverse each character in the string
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            // If the character is not a star, append it to the stack.
            if (c != '*') {
                stack.append(c);
            } 
            // If the character is a star, remove the last character from the stack.
            else {
                stack.deleteCharAt(stack.length() - 1);
            }
        }
        
        // Convert the stack back to a string and return.
        return stack.toString();
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The solution has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the string. This is because each character in the string is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also O(n) in the worst case, where all characters are pushed to the stack (i.e., when there are no stars or minimal stars in the string).
