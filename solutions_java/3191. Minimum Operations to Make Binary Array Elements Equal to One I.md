[Leetcode 3191. Minimum Operations to Make Binary Array Elements Equal to One I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3191)
### Problem Statement:

You are given a binary array (containing only 0s and 1s). You need to make all elements of the binary array equal to 1 using minimal operations. In one operation, you can do the following:

1. Choose any subarray and invert all elements of that subarray (change 0 to 1 and 1 to 0).

Return the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the array equal to 1.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **What is the length of the binary array?**
   - The length of the array can vary, the focus is to provide a generic solution.

2. **Are there any constraints on the size of the binary array?**
   - Usually, constraints such as length of the array (n) might be between 1 and \(10^5\).

3. **Can the array contain only 1s from the start?**
   - Yes, if the array already contains only 1s, the expected result would be 0.

### Strategy:

1. **Identify Zero Subarrays**:
   - Traverse through the array to identify contiguous subarrays of 0s.

2. **Count Subarrays**:
   - Count the number of contiguous subarrays of 0s.

3. **Optimal Solution**:
   - Each contiguous subarray of 0s will need at least one operation to be inverted into 1s. Hence, the number of such subarrays is the result.

### Time Complexity:

- The time complexity of this approach will be O(n), where n is the length of the binary array. This is because we traverse the array linearly once to count the contiguous subarrays of 0s.

### Code:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minOperationsToMakeAllOnes(int[] nums) {
        int operations = 0;
        int n = nums.length;
        boolean inZeroBlock = false;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == 0) {
                if (!inZeroBlock) {
                    operations++;
                    inZeroBlock = true;
                }
            } else {
                inZeroBlock = false;
            }
        }
        
        return operations;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solver = new Solution();
        int[] nums1 = {0, 1, 0, 0, 1}; // Example Case
        System.out.println(solver.minOperationsToMakeAllOnes(nums1)); // Output: 2

        int[] nums2 = {1, 1, 1}; // All 1s
        System.out.println(solver.minOperationsToMakeAllOnes(nums2)); // Output: 0

        int[] nums3 = {0, 0, 0, 0}; // All 0s
        System.out.println(solver.minOperationsToMakeAllOnes(nums3)); // Output: 1
    }
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Variable Initialization**:
   - `operations` is initialized to 0 to count the necessary operations.
   - `inZeroBlock` is a boolean to track whether we are within a zero block to avoid counting the same block multiple times.

2. **Traverse the Array**:
   - If a zero is encountered and it is not within a zero block, increment `operations` and set `inZeroBlock` to true.
   - If a one is encountered, reset `inZeroBlock` to false.

3. **Result**:
   - The total `operations` gives the minimum number of operations needed.

By the end of the traversal, you'll have the count of the minimal operations required to make all elements in the array equal to 1.
