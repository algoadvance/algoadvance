### Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 1464: Maximum Product of Two Elements in an Array

Given the array of integers `nums`, you will choose two different indices `i` and `j` of that array. Return the maximum value of `(nums[i] - 1) * (nums[j] - 1)`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Element Range**: Are the array elements guaranteed to be non-negative integers?
   - Yes.
2. **Array Size**: What is the range of the size of the array `nums`?
   - The array size will be at least 2 and can be up to 10^3.
3. **Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the values of the array elements?
   - Each `nums[i]` is an integer in the range [1, 10^3].

### Strategy

To find the maximum product of `(nums[i] - 1) * (nums[j] - 1)`, the optimal approach is to identify the two largest elements in the array because reducing the maximum numbers by 1 and then multiplying gives the highest product.

1. Traverse the array to find the maximum (`first_max`) and the second maximum (`second_max`) numbers.
2. Compute the product as `(first_max - 1) * (second_max - 1)` and return it.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxProduct(int[] nums) {
        // Initialize the first and second maximums
        int firstMax = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        int secondMax = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        
        // Traverse through the array to find the two largest numbers
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num > firstMax) {
                secondMax = firstMax;
                firstMax = num;
            } else if (num > secondMax) {
                secondMax = num;
            }
        }
        
        // Calculate and return the result
        return (firstMax - 1) * (secondMax - 1);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **O(n)**: The algorithm only makes a single pass through the array to identify the top two elements, where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`.

### Example Walkthrough

Consider `nums = [3, 4, 5, 2]`.

1. Initialization: `firstMax = Integer.MIN_VALUE`, `secondMax = Integer.MIN_VALUE`.
2. After processing element 3:
   - `firstMax = 3`, `secondMax = Integer.MIN_VALUE`.
3. After processing element 4:
   - `firstMax = 4`, `secondMax = 3`.
4. After processing element 5:
   - `firstMax = 5`, `secondMax = 4`.
5. After processing element 2:
   - No changes.
   
Final product: `(5 - 1) * (4 - 1) = 4 * 3 = 12`.
