[Leetcode 2391. Minimum Amount of Time to Collect Garbage](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2391)
Sure, let's go through the problem step by step.

### Problem Statement
You are given an array of strings `garbage` where `garbage[i]` represents the garbage at the i-th house. Each string in `garbage` consists only of characters `'P'`, `'G'`, and `'M'` which stand for paper, glass, and metal respectively. Each house should be visited to collect garbage.

You are also given an array `travel` where `travel[i]` indicates the time it takes to travel between the i-th house and the (i + 1)-th house.

Your task is to return the minimum amount of time needed to collect all the garbage. The time to collect garbage at a house is equal to the number of pieces of garbage at that house. You start collecting garbage from the 0-th house.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the travel array be smaller than the garbage array?
   - No, `travel` has exactly `n - 1` elements if `garbage` has `n` elements.
2. Are there constraints on the lengths of the `garbage` and `travel` arrays?
   - Yes, lengths should be manageable within problem bounds (e.g., `1 <= garbage.length <= 10^5`, `1 <= garbage[i].length <= 10^5`).

### Strategy
1. **Calculate Total Collection Time**: 
   - Collect garbage from all houses irrespective of travel time
   - Iterate through each house and count the characters `'P'`, `'G'`, and `'M'`.
2. **Travel Cost**: 
   - Track the farthest house that contains paper, glass, and metal respectively.
   - Sum up the travel times to reach these houses.

### Code Implementation
Here's the Java code to solve the problem:

```java
public class GarbageCollection {
    public int garbageCollection(String[] garbage, int[] travel) {
        int totalCollectionTime = 0;
        int lastPaper = 0, lastGlass = 0, lastMetal = 0;
        int paperTravel = 0, glassTravel = 0, metalTravel = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < garbage.length; i++) {
            totalCollectionTime += garbage[i].length();
            
            for (char c : garbage[i].toCharArray()) {
                if (c == 'P') {
                    lastPaper = i;
                } else if (c == 'G') {
                    lastGlass = i;
                } else if (c == 'M') {
                    lastMetal = i;
                }
            }
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= lastPaper; i++) {
            paperTravel += travel[i - 1];
        }

        for (int i = 1; i <= lastGlass; i++) {
            glassTravel += travel[i - 1];
        }
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= lastMetal; i++) {
            metalTravel += travel[i - 1];
        }
        
        return totalCollectionTime + paperTravel + glassTravel + metalTravel;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        GarbageCollection gc = new GarbageCollection();
        String[] garbage = {"G", "M", "P", "GP", "PG"};
        int[] travel = {2, 4, 3};
        System.out.println(gc.garbageCollection(garbage, travel)); // Output: 21
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **O(n + m)**: where `n` is the number of houses (length of `garbage`) and `m` is the sum of lengths of all strings in `garbage`. This is because we need to iterate through each house and each character in the house's garbage string.

This approach efficiently calculates both the collection and travel times, ensuring we meet the problem constraints.
