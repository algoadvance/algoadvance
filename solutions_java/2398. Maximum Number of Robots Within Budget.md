[Leetcode 2398. Maximum Number of Robots Within Budget](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2398)
## Problem Statement

You have `n` robots. You are given two integer arrays `chargeTimes` and `runningCosts`, both of length `n`. The `i-th` robot will take `chargeTimes[i]` units to charge, and `runningCosts[i]` units to run for one unit of time. You are also given an integer variable `budget`.

The cost of using `k` consecutive robots in your budget is defined as follows:
- The maximum charge time among the chosen robots.
- Plus the sum of running costs of those robots multiplied by `k`.

You want to determine the maximum number of consecutive robots you can pick such that the total cost does not exceed the `budget`.

### Input:
- `int[] chargeTimes`
- `int[] runningCosts`
- `int budget`

### Output:
- `int`: Maximum number of consecutive robots which you can use within budget.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q: Can `chargeTimes` and `runningCosts` have negative values?**
   - A: No, both arrays will have non-negative integers.

2. **Q: Can the budget be zero?**
   - A: Yes, the budget can be zero.

3. **Q: Are the values in `chargeTimes` and `runningCosts` distinct?**
   - A: There are no constraints provided that them distinct.

4. **Q: What is the range of the array lengths and values within the arrays?**
   - A: It's assumed that the lengths will be up to `10^5` and values can be large but within integer limits.

## Strategy:

1. Use a sliding window to keep track of the current subarray of robots with the maximum size.
2. Ensure that during the iteration:
   - Calculate the maximum `chargeTimes` within the current window efficiently, possibly using a deque.
   - Calculate the running costs sum within the current window.
   - Verify if the combined cost is within the budget.
3. If the cost exceeds the budget, shrink the window from the left until the cost fits within the budget.
4. Maintain the maximum size of valid window during the iteration.

## Code:

```java
import java.util.Deque;
import java.util.LinkedList;

public class Solution {
    public int maximumRobots(int[] chargeTimes, int[] runningCosts, int budget) {
        int n = chargeTimes.length;
        int maxConsecutiveRobots = 0;
        long currentRunningCostSum = 0;
        Deque<Integer> deque = new LinkedList<>();
        
        int left = 0;
        
        for (int right = 0; right < n; ++right) {
            // Maintain the deque for maximum charge time
            while (!deque.isEmpty() && chargeTimes[deque.getLast()] <= chargeTimes[right]) {
                deque.removeLast();
            }
            deque.addLast(right);
            
            currentRunningCostSum += runningCosts[right];
            
            // Total cost calculation
            while (!deque.isEmpty() && chargeTimes[deque.getFirst()] + (right - left + 1) * currentRunningCostSum > budget) {
                if (deque.getFirst() == left) deque.removeFirst();
                currentRunningCostSum -= runningCosts[left];
                left++;
            }
            
            // Valid window size
            maxConsecutiveRobots = Math.max(maxConsecutiveRobots, right - left + 1);
        }
        
        return maxConsecutiveRobots;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:

- **Calculation of maximum charge time using deque**: Each element is added and removed from the deque at most once, which is `O(n)`.
- **Running cost sum is maintained in `O(1)`** per iteration.

**Overall Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of `chargeTimes` or `runningCosts`.

This is efficient and should handle the upper constraints well.
