## Problem Statement
1987. Number of Unique Good Subsequences

Given a binary string `binary`, return the number of **unique good subsequences** of the binary string. A subsequence is good if it is not empty and does not have leading zeros (except for "0" itself).

Two subsequences are considered different if the string forms are different, regardless of their indices positions in the original string.

Since the answer might be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Example:
- Example 1:
  - **Input:** "001"
  - **Output:** 2
  - **Explanation:** The good subsequences are "0" and "1".

- Example 2:
  - **Input:** "11"
  - **Output:** 3
  - **Explanation:** The good subsequences are "1", "1", and "11".

### Constraints:
- `1 <= binary.length <= 10^5`
- `binary[i]` is either `'0'` or `'1'`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Is the input guaranteed to only contain characters '0' and '1'?
   - Yes, as provided in the constraints.

2. Is the length of the binary string fixed within the specified range?
   - Yes, the length is between `1` and `10^5`.

3. Should the output be returned modulo `10^9 + 7`?
   - Yes, as specified in the problem statement.

## Strategy
1. **Identify Good Subsequences:** 
    - All subsequences formed should be valid (i.e., no leading zeros unless the subsequence itself is "0").
    - Count and track the unique subsequences.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
    - Maintain a count of subsequences ending in '0' and '1'.
    - Update these counts as we traverse each character in the string.
    - Utilize a set to track unique subsequences to avoid duplicates.

3. **Modulo Operation:** 
    - Given that the result may be large, apply modulo `10^9 + 7` at appropriate steps during accumulation.

4. **Algorithm:**
    - Traverse the string.
    - Update counts of subsequences ending with '0' and '1'.
    - Use a variable to remember if the character '0' is available for valid subsequences.

## Code
Here is the Java implementation based on the above strategy:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

class Solution {
    public int numberOfUniqueGoodSubsequences(String binary) {
        final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;
        int hasZero = 0, endsWithZero = 0, endsWithOne = 0;
        
        for (char c : binary.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == '0') {
                endsWithZero = (endsWithZero + endsWithOne) % MOD;
                hasZero = 1;
            } else {
                endsWithOne = (endsWithZero + endsWithOne + 1) % MOD;
            }
        }
        
        return (endsWithOne + hasZero) % MOD;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.numberOfUniqueGoodSubsequences("001")); // expected output: 2
        System.out.println(sol.numberOfUniqueGoodSubsequences("11")); // expected output: 3
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the length of the binary string. We traverse the string once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1). We are using a few extra variables for counts and modulo operations.

This solution should efficiently handle the input constraints while ensuring we adhere to the requirements for good subsequences.
