[Leetcode 75. Sort Colors](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l75)
### Problem Statement

The problem is to sort an array containing only the integers `0`, `1`, and `2`. This is often referred to as the "Dutch National Flag" problem. You are required to sort the array in-place and in linear time.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can we use built-in sorting functions to solve this problem?
   - **A:** No, the problem specifically asks for an in-place solution with linear time complexity.

2. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the size of the array?
   - **A:** The size constraints are typical for interview problems, so you can assume the array will fit in memory.

3. **Q:** Is the input array mutable?
   - **A:** Yes, since the problem specifies sorting in-place.

### Strategy

To solve this problem in linear time and constant space, we can use the three-way partitioning approach (Dutch National Flag Algorithm). The approach involves maintaining three pointers to partition the array into three sections: one for `0`s, one for `1`s, and one for `2`s.

1. **Initialization:**
   - Define three pointers: `low`, `mid`, and `high`.
   - `low` is used to place `0`s.
   - `mid` is used to iterate through the array.
   - `high` is used to place `2`s.

2. **Procedure:**
   - Traverse the array with the `mid` pointer.
   - When encountering a `0`: swap it with the value at the `low` pointer, then increment both `low` and `mid`.
   - When encountering a `1`: simply move to the next element by incrementing `mid`.
   - When encountering a `2`: swap it with the value at the `high` pointer, then decrement `high`.

3. **Termination:**
   - The process continues until `mid` surpasses `high`.

### Code

Here is the Java implementation:

```java
public class Solution {
    public void sortColors(int[] nums) {
        // Pointers for the current front (low), current (mid), and back (high) positions
        int low = 0, mid = 0, high = nums.length - 1;

        // Traverse the array from start to end
        while (mid <= high) {
            if (nums[mid] == 0) {
                // Swap nums[mid] with nums[low] and increment both pointers
                swap(nums, low, mid);
                low++;
                mid++;
            } else if (nums[mid] == 1) {
                // Move mid pointer to the next element
                mid++;
            } else if (nums[mid] == 2) {
                // Swap nums[mid] with nums[high] and decrement high pointer
                swap(nums, mid, high);
                high--;
            }
        }
    }

    // Helper method to swap elements in an array
    private void swap(int[] nums, int i, int j) {
        int temp = nums[i];
        nums[i] = nums[j];
        nums[j] = temp;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {2, 0, 2, 1, 1, 0};
        sol.sortColors(nums);

        // Output the sorted array
        for (int num : nums) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(n)` because it processes each element of the array exactly once. 

The space complexity is `O(1)` because it only uses a few additional variables (pointers) and does not require any extra space that scales with the input size.
