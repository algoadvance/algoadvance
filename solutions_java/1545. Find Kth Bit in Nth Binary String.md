[Leetcode 1545. Find Kth Bit in Nth Binary String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1545)
### Problem Statement

Given two positive integers `n` and `k`, the task is to return the `k-th` bit in the `n-th` binary string `S(n)`. The binary string is defined recursively as follows:

- `S(1) = "0"`
- `S(i) = S(i-1) + "1" + reverse(invert(S(i-1)))` for `i > 1`

Where:
- `+` denotes concatenation
- `reverse(x)` returns the string `x` in reverse order
- `invert(x)` replaces each '0' with '1' and each '1' with '0'

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the constraints on values of `n` and `k`?
   - Are we guaranteed that `1 ≤ k ≤ length(S(n))`?

2. **Output:**
   - Is the output expected to be a character, i.e., either '0' or '1'?

### Provided Constraints

- 1 <= n <= 20
- 1 <= k <= 2^(n) - 1

### Strategy

Given the recursive construction of `S(n)`, directly constructing the string would be infeasible due to exponential growth. Instead, we can use a recursive approach to determine the k-th bit without constructing the entire string:

1. **Base Case:**
   - If `n == 1`, then `S(1) = "0"`, and the only bit is '0'.
   
2. **Recursive Case:**
   - Determine the length of `S(n-1)`, denoted as `length`. The total length of `S(n)` will be `2*length + 1`.
   - If `k` falls within the first `length` bits, it is the `k`-th bit of `S(n-1)`.
   - If `k` is exactly `length + 1`, it is the middle '1' in `S(n)`.
   - If `k` falls within the last `length` bits, it corresponds to the `2*length + 1 - k` bit in the reversed and inverted `S(n-1)`, requiring recursive handling.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public char findKthBit(int n, int k) {
        return findKthBitHelper(n, k);
    }

    private char findKthBitHelper(int n, int k) {
        // Base case
        if (n == 1) {
            return '0';
        }
        
        int length = (1 << (n - 1)) - 1; // length of S(n-1)
        
        if (k <= length) {
            // k-th bit in the first part S(n-1)
            return findKthBitHelper(n - 1, k);
        } else if (k == length + 1) {
            // Middle bit is always '1'
            return '1';
        } else {
            // k-th bit in the second part reverse(invert(S(n-1)))
            // The position `k` in the second half of S(n) corresponds to position `2*length+1-k` in S(n-1)
            char invertedChar = findKthBitHelper(n - 1, 2 * length + 1 - k);
            // Invert the character
            return invertedChar == '0' ? '1' : '0';
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.findKthBit(3, 1)); // Output: 0
        System.out.println(sol.findKthBit(4, 11)); // Output: 1
        System.out.println(sol.findKthBit(20, 1048575)); // Output: 0
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is `O(n)`, where `n` is the input parameter representing the level of recursion. Given that `n` is at most 20, this recursive approach is efficient and manageable within the provided constraints.
