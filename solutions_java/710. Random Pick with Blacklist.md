### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 710: Random Pick with Blacklist

**Description:**
Given an integer `n` and a list of integers `blacklist`, design an algorithm to pick a random integer in the range `[0, n-1]` that is not in the `blacklist`. The integer should be chosen with uniform probability.

Implement the `Solution` class:

- `Solution(int n, int[] blacklist)` Initializes the object with the integer `n` and the blacklist.
- `int pick()` Returns a random integer in the range `[0, n-1]` and not in the blacklist.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Values:**
   - Q: What is the range of `n` and `blacklist`?
   - A: `1 <= n <= 10^9`, `0 <= blacklist.length < min(10^5, n - 1)`, `0 <= blacklist[i] < n`

2. **Duplications:**
   - Q: Can there be duplicate entries in the blacklist?
   - A: No, the blacklist has unique integers.

3. **Performance:**
   - Q: Are there any performance constraints we need to consider?
   - A: Yes, we need to ensure that our solution is efficient for large values of `n` and the blacklist size.

### Strategy

1. **Mapping Blacklist:**
   - Use a `HashSet` to store the blacklist values for O(1) lookup time.

2. **Effective Range:**
   - Calculate the effective range of valid numbers as `m = n - black.length`.

3. **Mapping to Valid Spots:**
   - For each blacklist number that is less than `m`, map it to one of the valid numbers greater than or equal to `m` but not in the blacklist.

4. **Random Picking:**
   - Use `Random` to pick a number in the range `[0, m-1]`.
   - If the picked number is in the blacklist map, replace it with the mapped valid number.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    private int m;
    private Map<Integer, Integer> map;
    private Random rand;

    public Solution(int n, int[] blacklist) {
        map = new HashMap<>();
        rand = new Random();
        
        Set<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        for (int b : blacklist) {
            set.add(b);
        }
        
        m = n - set.size();
        
        int last = n - 1;
        for (int b : blacklist) {
            if (b < m) {
                while (set.contains(last)) {
                    last--;
                }
                map.put(b, last);
                last--;
            }
        }
    }
    
    public int pick() {
        int index = rand.nextInt(m);
        if (map.containsKey(index)) {
            return map.get(index);
        }
        return index;
    }
}

// Example usage
public class Main {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 10;
        int[] blacklist = {1, 3, 5, 7};
        Solution solution = new Solution(n, blacklist);
        
        System.out.println(solution.pick());
        System.out.println(solution.pick());
        System.out.println(solution.pick());
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Constructor (`Solution`):**
  - Constructing the set and map `O(B)` where `B` is the size of blacklist.
  - The total setup is `O(B)` since each initialization is O(1) on average.
  
- **Pick (`pick`):**
  - Picking a random integer and handling the mapping: `O(1)`.
  
Thus, the overall solution is efficient and should operate within acceptable limits for the provided constraints.
