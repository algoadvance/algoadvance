[Leetcode 1782. Count Pairs Of Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1782)
## Problem Statement

Given an undirected graph with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`. You are given an integer array `degrees` of length `n`, where `degrees[i]` represents the degree of the `i-th` node to be exactly `degrees[i]`, and an array `edges` where `edges[j] = [u, v]` denotes that there is an undirected edge between nodes `u` and `v`.

Return the number of pairs `(u, v)` where `u < v` and the sum of degrees of `u` and `v` is exactly `k`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Degree Definition**: Does the degree account for the actual graph's degree or degrees already given by the input array?
   - **Clarification**: The degree defined in the input array represents the specified degree of each node.
2. **Edge Cases**: Are there edge cases like self-loops or multiple edges between the same pair of nodes?
   - **Clarification**: No self-loops or multiple edges exist between the same pair of nodes in the input.

## Strategy

1. **Initial Setup**: Parse the input to understand the degrees and edges provided.
2. **Calculate Actual Degrees**: Create a degree array to represent the actual degrees from the graph.
3. **Pair Evaluation**: Use nested loops to evaluate pairs of nodes `(u, v)` to check if their combined degrees equal `k`.
4. **Edge Contribution Check**: Ensure that each pair considers whether their direct edge affects the degree sum.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int countPairs(int n, int[] degrees, int[][] edges, int k) {
        // Actual degrees from the input graph
        int[] actualDegrees = new int[n + 1];
        
        // Fill the actual degree array with the given degrees
        for (int edgeIndex = 0; edgeIndex < edges.length; edgeIndex++) {
            actualDegrees[edges[edgeIndex][0]]++;
            actualDegrees[edges[edgeIndex][1]]++;
        }

        Map<Integer, Set<Integer>> graph = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            graph.put(i, new HashSet<>());
        }
        
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            graph.get(edge[0]).add(edge[1]);
            graph.get(edge[1]).add(edge[0]);
        }

        int count = 0;
        
        for (int u = 1; u <= n; u++) {
            for (int v = u + 1; v <= n; v++) {
                int degSum = actualDegrees[u] + actualDegrees[v];
                if (graph.get(u).contains(v)) {
                    degSum--;  // Remove the duplicate contribution from their direct connection
                }
                if (degSum == k) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }

        return count;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Degree Calculation**: O(n + m), where `m` is the number of edges.
- **Pair Evaluation**: O(n^2) due to nested loop through all node pairs.

Total time complexity: **O(n^2 + m)**, where `n` is the number of nodes and `m` is the number of edges. This captures the cost of calculating degrees and evaluating pairs.
