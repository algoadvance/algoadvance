[Leetcode 3007. Maximum Number That Sum of the Prices Is Less Than or Equal to K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3007)
### Problem Statement

Given a list of prices of different items and a budget `K`, your goal is to determine the maximum number of items you can buy without exceeding the given budget `K`. You are allowed to buy each item only once.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Do prices include negative values?
    - No, prices are non-negative integers.
2. Can `K` be negative?
    - No, `K` is a non-negative integer.
3. Can the price list be empty?
    - Yes, if the price list is empty, the answer should be `0`.
4. Are there duplicate prices?
    - Yes, duplicate prices are allowed.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the prices**: The primary objective is to get the maximum number of items, so start by sorting the prices in ascending order.
2. **Iterate through the sorted prices**: Begin accumulating the sum of the prices from the least expensive item upwards, and count the number of items until the sum exceeds `K`.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MaxItemsWithinBudget {
    public static int maxItems(int[] prices, int K) {
        Arrays.sort(prices);  // Sort prices in ascending order
        int sum = 0;
        int itemCount = 0;

        for (int price : prices) {
            if (sum + price <= K) {
                sum += price;
                itemCount++;
            } else {
                break;  // Stop if adding the next item exceeds the budget
            }
        }

        return itemCount;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] prices = {1, 12, 5, 111, 200, 1000, 10};
        int K = 50;
        System.out.println("Maximum number of items: " + maxItems(prices, K));  // Output should be 4; we can buy items with prices 1, 5, 10, 12
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: The sorting step takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of prices.
- **Iteration**: The iteration step takes \(O(n)\) time in the worst case, where \(n\) is the number of prices.

**Overall Time Complexity**: \(O(n \log n)\)

This ensures an efficient algorithm that works well even for larger lists of item prices.
