[Leetcode 481. Magical String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l481)
## Problem Statement

A magical string `s` is a string only consisting of '1' and '2' and obeys the following rules:

1. The string `s` is unfolded as follows: s = "1221121221221121122......"
2. You can see that the first 1 always appears at position 1, and the second 1 always appears at position 5.

Given an integer `n`, return the number of '1's in the first `n` number in the magical string.

**Example:**

```java
Input: n = 6
Output: 3
Explanation: The first 6 elements of magical string s are "122112" and it contains three 1's, so return 3.
```

**Constraints:**

- 1 <= n <= 10^5

## Clarifying Questions

1. Do we need to return the count of '1's within the first `n` characters if `n` is greater than the length of the string described in the examples?
   - The length of the string `s` defined in the unfolded manner continues indefinitely as per the folding rules. 
2. Is the sequence of the string strictly defined by the given example?
   - Yes, we need to follow the rules based on the given structural pattern.

## Strategy

1. Initialize the magical string with its beginning sequence: `s = "122"`.
2. Use two pointers: one for reading the current value to determine the next segments and one for appending new values to `s`.
3. Start processing the string and construct it iteratively until you've built up to at least `n` characters.
4. Keep count of '1's while building the string.

```java
public class Solution {
    public int magicalString(int n) {
        if (n <= 0) return 0;
        if (n <= 3) return 1; // Base case, since "122" contains one '1' in the first 3 chars.
        
        StringBuilder s = new StringBuilder("122");
        int count = 1; // Initially, we have one '1'.
        int head = 2, tail = 3; // head for reading, tail for adding new values.
        
        while (s.length() < n) {
            int numToAdd = s.charAt(tail - 1) - '0'; // Determine the number to add based on last character in `s`
            int times = s.charAt(head++) - '0';       // Determine how many times to add it.

            for (int i = 0; i < times; i++) {
                s.append(numToAdd);
                if (numToAdd == 1 && s.length() <= n) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
            tail++;
        }
        
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.magicalString(6)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- Constructing the magical string involves iterating until we hit at least `n` characters:
  - The complexity of appending scales as `O(n)` for the above approach since every new section is computed and appended directly proportional to `n` values.

Therefore, the overall time complexity for this solution is approximately O(n).
