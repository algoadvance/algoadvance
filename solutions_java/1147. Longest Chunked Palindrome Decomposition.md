[Leetcode 1147. Longest Chunked Palindrome Decomposition](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1147)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `text`, return the longest possible chunked palindrome decomposition. A chunked palindrome decomposition of a string is a palindrome formed by splitting the string into chunks of consecutive characters such that:

1. There are minimum chunks.
2. Each chunk d_i from the beginning of the string should be equal to the chunk d_n-i from the end of the string.

### Example
- Input: `text = "volvo"`
- Output: `3`
  Explanation: The chunked palindrome is ["v", "olvo", "v"].

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the expected output for empty strings?**
   - If the string is empty, the output should be `0`.

2. **What is the significance of each chunk d_i being equal to d_n-i?**
   - This means that the ith chunk from the start should match the ith chunk from the end.

3. **Can the chunks vary in length?**
   - Yes, chunks can vary in length as long as the decomposition forms a palindrome.

4. **Could you provide another example for better understanding?**
   - Sure! For the input `ghiabcdefhelloadamhelloabcdefghi`, the output should be `7`, with chunks being [ghi, abcdef, hello, adam, hello, abcdef, ghi].

### Strategy

The strategy involves using a two-pointer technique where:
1. We initialize two pointers `l` (left) starting from the beginning and `r` (right) starting from the end of the string.
2. We compare substrings starting from `l` and `r` and keep extending the length of the substrings being compared until we find a match.
3. Once a match is found, we increment our chunk count and update our pointers to move inward.
4. We repeat this process until the two pointers cross each other.
5. Any remaining characters between the two pointers are considered one additional chunk.

### Code

Here's the Java implementation:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int longestDecomposition(String text) {
        int n = text.length();
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        
        int chunkCount = 0;
        int l = 0;
        int r = n;

        while (l < r) {
            String left = "";
            String right = "";

            // Extend left and right substrings until they match
            for (int i = 1; l + i <= r; i++) {
                left = text.substring(l, l + i);
                right = text.substring(r - i, r);
                if (left.equals(right)) {
                    chunkCount += 2;  // one chunk from the start, one from the end
                    l += i;
                    r -= i;
                    break;
                }
            }
            
            // If left and right substrings never matched and pointers crossed
            if (!left.equals(right)) {
                chunkCount++;
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return chunkCount;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization:** We initialize `chunkCount` to 0 and set `l` to 0 and `r` to the length of the text.
2. **Two-pointer Technique:** Use a for loop to extend substrings `left` from `l` and `right` from `r`. Compare these substrings.
3. **Match Check:** If `left` equals `right`, we consider this a chunk and increment the chunkCount by 2, then move our pointers inward.
4. **Pointer Cross Check:** If `l` and `r` pointers cross each other before a match is found, we need an additional chunk (for the remaining substring).
5. **Return Result:** The final value of `chunkCount` is returned as the result.

### Time Complexity

- **Worst-case time complexity:** O(n^2) where `n` is the length of the input string.
  - In each step, we compare substrings wih a cumulative length that may sum up to `n`.

This guarantees a correct and optimized solution for the problem in the context of chunked palindrome decomposition.
