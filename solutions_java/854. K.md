[Leetcode 854. K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l854)
### Problem Statement

Given two anagrams `s1` and `s2`, the goal is to determine the minimum number of adjacent swaps required to make `s1` equal to `s2`. An anagram is a string that can be rearranged to form another string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Validity**: Are `s1` and `s2` guaranteed to be of the same length and anagrams of each other?
   - **Assumption**: Yes, `s1` and `s2` are always the same length and are anagrams.
   
2. **Character Set**: What kind of characters can `s1` and `s2` contain?
   - **Assumption**: Both `s1` and `s2` contain lowercase English letters only.

3. **String Length**: What is the maximum length of `s1` and `s2`?
   - **Assumption**: This can be derived from typical constraints on leetcode, say reasonable constraints up to 100 characters.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can utilize a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach for finding the shortest path in the transformation sequence. This approach will allow us to systematically explore all possible adjacent swaps and find the minimum number needed to transform `s1` into `s2`.

1. **Initialization**:
    - We can initialize a queue for BFS that stores the current string and the number of swaps taken to reach this string.
    - Also maintain a set to track visited strings to avoid repeated work.

2. **BFS Execution**:
    - For each string in the queue, if it matches `s2`, return the number of swaps taken.
    - If not, generate all possible strings by swapping adjacent characters and add them to the queue if they haven't been visited before.

3. **Optimizing Swaps**:
    - To minimize the number of swaps, identify the first character in the current string that does not match the corresponding character in `s2` and generate swaps from there only.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;
import java.util.Set;

public class Solution {
    public int kSimilarity(String s1, String s2) {
        if (s1.equals(s2)) return 0;
        
        Queue<String> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(s1);
        Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();
        visited.add(s1);
        
        int swaps = 0;
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int size = queue.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                String current = queue.poll();
                if (current.equals(s2)) {
                    return swaps;
                }
                
                for (String neighbor : generateNeighbors(current, s2)) {
                    if (!visited.contains(neighbor)) {
                        visited.add(neighbor);
                        queue.offer(neighbor);
                    }
                }
            }
            swaps++;
        }
        
        return -1;  // Should never be reached if s1 and s2 are anagrams
    }
    
    private Iterable<String> generateNeighbors(String s, String target) {
        Set<String> neighbors = new HashSet<>();
        char[] arr = s.toCharArray();
        
        int i = 0;
        while (arr[i] == target.charAt(i)) {
            i++;
        }
        
        for (int j = i + 1; j < arr.length; j++) {
            if (arr[j] == target.charAt(i)) {
                swap(arr, i, j);
                neighbors.add(new String(arr));
                swap(arr, i, j); // swap back to try other possibilities
            }
        }
        
        return neighbors;
    }
    
    private void swap(char[] arr, int i, int j) {
        char temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[j];
        arr[j] = temp;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Queue Operations**: In the worst case, our BFS would have to explore all permutations of the string. Since the length of the string is `n`, there are `n!` permutations. However, actual steps would be minimized by BFS short-circuiting.
- **Neighbor Generation**: For each string, generating neighbors is `O(n^2)` in the worst case.

Therefore, the time complexity is challenging to state precisely due to the exponential nature of permutations but can be approximated as `O(n * (n!))` in the worst case, considering pruning and early termination can significantly reduce this in practice.
