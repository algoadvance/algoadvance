[Leetcode 1967. Number of Strings That Appear as Substrings in Word full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1967)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `patterns` and a string `word`. You need to determine how many strings in `patterns` appear as substrings in `word`.

Return the number of strings in `patterns` that appear as substrings in `word`.

**Example:**
```
Input: patterns = ["a","abc","bc","d"], word = "abc"
Output: 3
Explanation:
- "a" appears as a substring in "abc".
- "abc" appears as a substring in "abc".
- "bc" appears as a substring in "abc".
- "d" does not appear as a substring in "abc".
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the length constraint for the `patterns` array and the `word` string?
2. Are there any specific characters allowed or disallowed in `patterns` and `word`?
3. Should the substring matching be case-sensitive?

**Assumptions:**
- The sum of the length of all strings in `patterns` is <= 10^4.
- Characters can be any valid ASCII characters.
- Substring matching is case-sensitive.

### Strategy

1. **Loop through each pattern in `patterns`.**
2. **Check if each pattern is a substring in `word`.**
3. **Keep a count of how many patterns are substrings in `word`.**
4. **Return the count.**

To determine if one string is a substring of another, we can use the `contains` method of the `String` class in Java.

### Code

```java
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public int numOfStrings(String[] patterns, String word) {
        int count = 0;
        for (String pattern : patterns) {
            if (word.contains(pattern)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        String[] patterns = {"a","abc","bc","d"};
        String word = "abc";
        System.out.println(sol.numOfStrings(patterns, word)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n * m)
  - n: Number of patterns in `patterns`
  - m: Average length of patterns
  - The `contains` method in Java is O(m) where m is the length of the substring to be matched in the worst case. Given that the sum of the length of all strings in `patterns` is <= 10^4, this approach is efficient for competitive programming.

- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - We only use a fixed amount of extra space for the counter and no additional data structures.

This solution should efficiently solve the problem within the given constraints.
