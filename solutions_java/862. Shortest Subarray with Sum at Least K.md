[Leetcode 862. Shortest Subarray with Sum at Least K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l862)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `K`. Find the length of the shortest non-empty subarray of `nums` with a sum of at least `K`. If no such subarray exists, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on the Array and K:**
   - What is the range of possible values for the elements in `nums`?
   - What is the range for the value of `K`?
   
2. **Problem Boundaries:**
   - Can the array `nums` contain both positive and negative integers?
   - Do the elements of `nums` follow any special properties or constraints?

3. **Performance Expectations:**
   - What is the desired time complexity for the solution?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will use a **deque** (double-ended queue) and the prefix sums to find the shortest subarray with a sum of at least `K`. The general idea is:

1. Calculate the prefix sums array `P` where `P[i]` is the sum of the first `i` elements of `nums`.
2. Use a deque to keep track of indices of the prefix sums array in a way that ensures the elements in the deque are in increasing order of values in `P` and their indices.
3. Iterate through the prefix sums array, and for each element:
   - Remove indices from the front of the deque while their corresponding prefix sum results in a subarray sum greater than or equal to `K`.
   - Remove indices from the back of the deque to maintain the increasing order of values in `P`.
   - Add the current index to the deque.
4. Track the shortest subarray length during this process.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Deque;
import java.util.LinkedList;

public class Solution {
    public int shortestSubarray(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        long[] prefixSums = new long[n + 1];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            prefixSums[i + 1] = prefixSums[i] + nums[i];
        }
        
        Deque<Integer> deque = new LinkedList<>();
        int minLength = n + 1;  // Initialized to an impossible large value
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; ++i) {
            // Check if we can pop from the deque to find a valid subarray
            while (!deque.isEmpty() && prefixSums[i] - prefixSums[deque.peekFirst()] >= k) {
                minLength = Math.min(minLength, i - deque.pollFirst());
            }
            
            // Maintain the increasing order in the deque
            while (!deque.isEmpty() && prefixSums[i] <= prefixSums[deque.peekLast()]) {
                deque.pollLast();
            }
            
            deque.offerLast(i);
        }
        
        return minLength <= n ? minLength : -1;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - We iterate through the `nums` array once to calculate the prefix sums.
  - Each index of the prefix sums will be added and removed from the deque at most once.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - We store the prefix sums array of size `n + 1`.
  - We use a deque which in the worst case scenario could store all indices from `0` to `n`.

### Explanation

- **Prefix Sums Calculation:** `prefixSums` array is used to efficiently calculate the sum of any subarray.
- **Deque Operations:** The deque helps in managing the indices and ensuring that the sum of subarrays can be efficiently calculated to meet the required condition.

This approach ensures the solution is optimal and handles different cases efficiently.
