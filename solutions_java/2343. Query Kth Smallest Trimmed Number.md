[Leetcode 2343. Query Kth Smallest Trimmed Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2343)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed array of strings `nums`, where each string is of equal length, and an array of query pairs `queries` where each query is represented as `(k, trim)`. For each query `(k, trim)`, you need to trim each number in `nums` to its rightmost `trim` digits and then determine the `k`th smallest number from the trimmed list. You should return an array of integers representing the results of these queries.

### Example

**Input:**

```java
String[] nums = {"102","473","251","814"};
int[][] queries = // use example from above
```

**Output:**

```java
[2, 2, 1, 0]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all strings in the `nums` array guaranteed to be the same length?**
   * Yes, all strings in `nums` are guaranteed to be of equal length.
   
2. **Can there be any leading zeros in the strings?**
   * Yes, strings can have leading zeros.

3. **Is the index `k` 1-based or 0-based?**
   * The index `k` is 1-based.

4. **How should ties be resolved when the trimmed numbers are the same?**
   * If there are ties, resolve them by the original indices of the numbers in the `nums` array.

5. **Any constraints on the lengths of `nums` and `queries`?**
   * Let's assume constraints similar to the problem description:
     * `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
     * `1 <= nums[i].length <= 100`
     * `1 <= queries.length <= 100`
     * `1 <= k <= nums.length`
     * `1 <= trim <= nums[i].length`

### Strategy

1. **Iterate through each query**: 
    * For each query `(k, trim)`, create a list of pairs where each pair consists of the trimmed version of a number and its original index.

2. **Trim the Numbers**:
    * Extract the rightmost `trim` characters for each string in `nums`.

3. **Sort the Trimmed Numbers**:
    * Sort these trimmed numbers lexicographically. In case of ties, use the original indices to maintain order.

4. **Select the k-th Smallest**:
    * From the sorted list, fetch the `k`-th smallest (1-based index) and return the original index of that number.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class KthSmallestTrimmedNumber {

    public static int[] smallestTrimmedNumbers(String[] nums, int[][] queries) {
        int[] result = new int[queries.length];

        for (int i = 0; i < queries.length; i++) {
            int k = queries[i][0];
            int trim = queries[i][1];

            List<Pair> trimmedList = new ArrayList<>();

            // Create trimmed numbers with their indices
            for (int j = 0; j < nums.length; j++) {
                String trimmed = nums[j].substring(nums[j].length() - trim);
                trimmedList.add(new Pair(trimmed, j));
            }

            // Sort the list by trimmed numbers
            Collections.sort(trimmedList, new Comparator<Pair>() {
                public int compare(Pair p1, Pair p2) {
                    int cmp = p1.trimmed.compareTo(p2.trimmed);
                    if (cmp == 0) {
                        return Integer.compare(p1.index, p2.index);
                    }
                    return cmp;
                }
            });

            // Get the k-th smallest trimmed number (1-based, so k-1)
            result[i] = trimmedList.get(k - 1).index;
        }

        return result;
    }

    private static class Pair {
        String trimmed;
        int index;

        Pair(String trimmed, int index) {
            this.trimmed = trimmed;
            this.index = index;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] nums = {"102","473","251","814"};
        int[][] queries = // use example from above
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(smallestTrimmedNumbers(nums, queries)));  // Output: [2, 2, 1, 0]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Trimming:** `O(n)` per query, where `n` is the number of strings in `nums`.
- **Sorting:** `O(n log n)` per query.
- **Overall Complexity:** Given `q` queries, where `q <= 100`,
  - Total complexity is `O(q * (n log n))`.

This solution ensures that each query is handled efficiently within acceptable limits based on the typical constraint of the problem.
