[Leetcode 1286. Iterator for Combination](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1286)
### Problem Statement

You need to design an iterator class that iterates over all possible combinations of a given string's characters of a given length. The iterator should provide the next combination when called and should also be able to tell if there are more combinations left to iterate.

Design a class `CombinationIterator` which:

1. Has a constructor `CombinationIterator(String characters, int combinationLength)` initializes the object with a string `characters` and an integer `combinationLength`.
2. Has a function `next()` which returns the next combination of length `combinationLength` in lexicographical order.
3. Has a function `hasNext()` which returns `true` if there is a next combination, otherwise `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - `characters` string length range: 1 to 15.
   - `characters` string contains only lowercase English letters.
   - All characters in `characters` are unique.
   - `combinationLength` ranges from 1 to the length of `characters`.

2. **Output Expectation**:
   - `next()` should return the next lexicographical combination of the specified length.
   - `hasNext()` should return a boolean indicating if there are more combinations to return.

### Strategy

To implement the `CombinationIterator`, we can use the following steps:

1. **Generate All Combinations**: Generate all the combinations of the given length from the input string in lexicographical order.
2. **Store Combinations**: Store these combinations in a list.
3. **Iterator Mechanism**: Use the list's index to keep track of the current combination to be returned.

### Code

Here's the implementation:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class CombinationIterator {
    private List<String> combinations;
    private int currentIndex;

    public CombinationIterator(String characters, int combinationLength) {
        combinations = new ArrayList<>();
        currentIndex = 0;
        generateCombinations(characters, combinationLength, 0, new StringBuilder());
    }

    private void generateCombinations(String characters, int combinationLength, int start, StringBuilder combination) {
        if (combination.length() == combinationLength) {
            combinations.add(combination.toString());
            return;
        }
        for (int i = start; i < characters.length(); i++) {
            combination.append(characters.charAt(i));
            generateCombinations(characters, combinationLength, i + 1, combination);
            combination.deleteCharAt(combination.length() - 1);
        }
    }

    public String next() {
        return combinations.get(currentIndex++);
    }

    public boolean hasNext() {
        return currentIndex < combinations.size();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CombinationIterator iterator = new CombinationIterator("abc", 2);
        while (iterator.hasNext()) {
            System.out.println(iterator.next());
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Combination Generation (`generateCombinations` method)**:
   - Generating all combinations of length `combinationLength` from `characters` string of length `n` results in `O(C(n, combinationLength))` calls, where \( C(n, combinationLength) \) is the number of combinations.
   - Each combination generation consists of creating and updating a StringBuilder, leading the overall complexity to: \( O(combinationLength * C(n, combinationLength)) \).

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is primarily driven by storing all the combinations, which also amounts to \( O(combinationLength * C(n, combinationLength)) \).

3. **`next` and `hasNext` methods**:
   - Both methods operate in O(1) time.

This strategy ensures that we efficiently generate and retrieve combinations in lexicographical order, conforming to the problem requirements.
