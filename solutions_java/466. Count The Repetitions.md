[Leetcode 466. Count The Repetitions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l466)
### Problem Statement

The problem is as follows:

Define `S = [s,n]` as the string `s` concatenated `n` times. For example, `S = ["abc", 3]` is "abcabcabc".

We define that string `s1` can be obtained from string `s2` (denoted as `s1 | s2`) if we can remove some characters from `s2` such that the remaining characters of `s2` form `s1`.

Given two strings `s1` and `s2` and two integers `n1` and `n2`, return the maximum integer `m` such that `[s2, m]` can be obtained from `[s1, n1]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is there any constraint on the length of `s1` or `s2`?**
   - Constraints will typically follow limits within computational feasibility.

2. **Can `s1` or `s2` be empty?**
   - No, `s1` and `s2` are non-empty based on the problem context.

3. **Will `n1` and `n2` always be positive integers?**
   - Yes, both `n1` and `n2` are positive integers.

### Strategy

1. **Simulate the Process:**
   - We will simulate the process of generating `[s1, n1]` and try to find out how many times we can extract `[s2, 1]` from it.

2. **Cycle Detection:**
   - Given the repetitive nature of the problem, there might be cycles. We need to detect cycles for efficient counting.

3. **Prefix Processing:**
   - Determine how many times we can extract `s2` while processing the prefix of `[s1, n1]`.

4. **Main and Suffix Processing:**
   - Count how many `s2` we can obtain in the main repetitive process and handle the suffix if it does not complete a full cycle.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int getMaxRepetitions(String s1, int n1, String s2, int n2) {
        if (n1 == 0) return 0;

        int len1 = s1.length(), len2 = s2.length();
        int[] repeatCount = new int[len2 + 1]; // count of [s2] found in certain runs of [s1]
        int[] indexNext = new int[len2 + 1]; // next starting index in s2 after current run of [s1]

        int j = 0, count = 0; // j is current index of s2, count is the number of s2 found

        for (int k = 1; k <= n1; k++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < len1; i++) {
                if (s1.charAt(i) == s2.charAt(j)) {
                    j++;
                    if (j == len2) {
                        j = 0;
                        count++;
                    }
                }
            }

            repeatCount[k] = count;
            indexNext[k] = j;

            // Check for a repeating pattern
            for (int start = 0; start < k; start++) {
                if (indexNext[start] == j) {
                    int priorCount = repeatCount[start];
                    int patternLength = k - start;
                    int patternCount = (n1 - start) / patternLength;
                    int remainCount = repeatCount[start + (n1 - start) % patternLength];
                    return (priorCount + patternCount * (repeatCount[k] - priorCount) + remainCount) / n2;
                }
            }
        }

        return repeatCount[n1] / n2;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(len1 * n1)` where `len1` is the length of `s1` and `n1` is the number of times `s1` is repeated. The nested loops iterate over the length of `s1` for each `k` up to `n1`.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(len2)` for the additional arrays used for cycle detection and counting.

This solution efficiently counts how many times `s2` can be obtained from `s1` concatenated `n1` times using a combination of brute-force simulation and clever cycle-detection.
