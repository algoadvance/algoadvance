[Leetcode 1609. Even Odd Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1609)
### Problem Statement
You are given the `root` of a binary tree. A Binary Tree is named Even-Odd if it meets the following conditions:
1. The root of the binary tree is at level index 0, its children are at level index 1, their children are at level index 2, etc.
2. For every even-indexed level, all nodes at the level have odd integer values in strictly increasing order (from left to right).
3. For every odd-indexed level, all nodes at the level have even integer values in strictly decreasing order (from left to right).

Return `true` if the binary tree is Even-Odd, otherwise return `false`.

#### Example:
```
Input: root = [1,10,4,3,null,7,9,12,8,6,null,null,2]
Output: false

Explanation: The node values on the level 0 = [1] is odd, so it is valid. The node values on the level 1 = [10,4] are even, but they are not strictly decreasing.
Hence it is not an Even-Odd tree.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the values of the binary tree be negative?**
   No, it is specified in the problem that the integer values will be considered as odd or even, so negative values wouldnâ€™t make much sense here.
   
2. **How should we handle an empty tree?**
   If the tree is empty (i.e., `root` is `null`), it should return `true` as technically there are no levels to violate the conditions.

3. **Is the tree guaranteed to be valid (binary)?**
   Yes, you can assume the tree is valid as a binary tree, meaning each node has at most two children.
   
### Strategy
1. We will use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach, utilizing a queue to traverse each level of the binary tree.
2. We will maintain a level variable to track the current level of nodes being processed.
3. For each even-indexed level, we will ensure:
   - All values are odd.
   - Values are in strictly increasing order.
4. For each odd-indexed level, we will ensure:
   - All values are even.
   - Values are in strictly decreasing order.
5. If at any point any of the above conditions are violated, we will return `false`.
6. If all levels meet the conditions, we return `true`.

### Code
```java
import java.util.*;

class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode() {}
    TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
    TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

public class Solution {
    public boolean isEvenOddTree(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return true; // An empty tree is considered valid
        }

        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(root);
        int level = 0;

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int levelSize = queue.size();
            Integer prev = null;

            for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
                TreeNode node = queue.poll();
                int val = node.val;

                if (level % 2 == 0) { // Even level
                    if (val % 2 == 0 || (prev != null && val <= prev)) {
                        return false;
                    }
                } else { // Odd level
                    if (val % 2 != 0 || (prev != null && val >= prev)) {
                        return false;
                    }
                }
                prev = val;

                if (node.left != null) {
                    queue.add(node.left);
                }
                if (node.right != null) {
                    queue.add(node.right);
                }
            }
            level++;
        }

        return true;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The algorithm traverses each node of the binary tree exactly once.
- Each node is processed in constant time for checking the conditions and updating the queue.
- Therefore, the time complexity of the solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the binary tree.
