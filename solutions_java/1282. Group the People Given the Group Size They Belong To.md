[Leetcode 1282. Group the People Given the Group Size They Belong To](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1282)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `groupSizes`, where `groupSizes[i]` is the group size for the i-th person. Return the groups such that each person `i` is part of a group of size `groupSizes[i]`. Each person should appear in exactly one group, and each group should contain exactly `groupSizes[i]` people.

### Example

**Input:**
```java
groupSizes = [3,3,3,3,3,1,3]
```

**Output:**
```java
[[5],[0,1,2],[3,4,6]]
```

**Input:**
```java
groupSizes = [2,1,3,3,3,2]
```

**Output:**
```java
[[1],[0,5],[2,3,4]]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all elements in `groupSizes` guaranteed to be valid integers?**
   - Yes, all elements are valid integers.
   
2. **What is the maximum length of the `groupSizes` array?**
   - You can assume the length of the array will not exceed 1000.
   
3. **Is the order of groups in the output important?**
   - No, the order of groups in the output does not matter.

### Strategy

1. **Use a HashMap:** Use a HashMap to group indices of people according to their group sizes. The key of the HashMap will be the group size, and the value will be a list of indices of people that have that group size.
2. **Form groups:** Iterate over the `groupSizes` array and populate the HashMap. Once a list reaches its designated group size, it should be added to the result list and cleared to gather more groups of the same size.
3. **Return results:** Finally, return all the groups collected.

### Code

Here is the Java implementation of the above strategy:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class GroupPeopleBySize {
    public List<List<Integer>> groupThePeople(int[] groupSizes) {
        List<List<Integer>> res = new ArrayList<>();
        HashMap<Integer, List<Integer>> map = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < groupSizes.length; i++) {
            int size = groupSizes[i];
            if (!map.containsKey(size)) {
                map.put(size, new ArrayList<>());
            }
            map.get(size).add(i);
            
            if (map.get(size).size() == size) {
                res.add(new ArrayList<>(map.get(size)));
                map.get(size).clear();
            }
        }
        
        return res;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        GroupPeopleBySize solution = new GroupPeopleBySize();
        int[] groupSizes1 = {3, 3, 3, 3, 3, 1, 3};
        int[] groupSizes2 = {2, 1, 3, 3, 3, 2};

        System.out.println(solution.groupThePeople(groupSizes1)); // [[5], [0, 1, 2], [3, 4, 6]]
        System.out.println(solution.groupThePeople(groupSizes2)); // [[1], [0, 5], [2, 3, 4]]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Time Complexity:** The solution involves iterating the `groupSizes` array once and maintaining a HashMap. Hence, the time complexity is `O(N)`, where `N` is the length of the `groupSizes` array.
2. **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is also `O(N)` because we are storing all indices in the HashMap.

This solution is efficient and meets the requirements provided in the problem statement.
