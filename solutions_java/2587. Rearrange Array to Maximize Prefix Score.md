[Leetcode 2587. Rearrange Array to Maximize Prefix Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2587)
### Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`. You can rearrange the elements of `nums` to maximize the value of the prefix score.

The prefix score of `nums` is defined as the sum of the scores of all prefixes of `nums`.

Let `score` be the sum of elements in some prefix of `nums`. The score of this prefix is the number of positive integers in the prefix.

Return *the maximum prefix score you can achieve*.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is a prefix score?**
    - A prefix score is the count of positive numbers in a prefix of `nums`.

2. **How is the "prefix score" calculated for different possible arrangements of `nums`?**
    - For each prefix, if the sum of its elements is positive, the prefix score adds the number of positive elements in that prefix. Maximum prefix score can be obtained by managing the arrangement to maintain maximum positivity in sums for the most prefixes.

3. **Can the array have negative integers?**
    - Yes, the array can include negative integers.

4. **Is the array length within a certain range?**
    - Typically, for LeetCode problems, you may assume the array length can be up to \(10^5\).

### Strategy

1. **Sort `nums` in non-increasing order:**
   - By sorting in descending order, we ensure that positive numbers come first and are included as early as possible in each prefix, maximizing the chance of positive prefix sums.

2. **Iterate through `nums` to calculate prefix scores:**
   - Maintain a running sum and count the number of prefixes maintaining a positive sum.

3. **Return the maximum number of positive prefixes:**
   - Count and sum the positive prefixes obtainable with the sorted array.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MaxPrefixScore {
    public int maxScore(int[] nums) {
        // Sort the array in non-increasing order
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        int n = nums.length;
        
        // Create a prefix sum from the sorted array to count positive sums
        int prefixSum = 0;
        int prefixScore = 0;
        
        // Traverse from the last to first to create the non-increasing order
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            prefixSum += nums[i];
            if (prefixSum > 0) {
                prefixScore++;
            } else {
                // If the sum becomes non-positive, no point in continuing
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return prefixScore;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaxPrefixScore solution = new MaxPrefixScore();
        int[] nums = {1, -2, 3, 5, -1, 2};
        System.out.println(solution.maxScore(nums));  // Output should be 4
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the array:** \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Iterating through the array to calculate prefix scores:** \(O(n)\)

Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it \(O(n \log n)\).

This approach ensures that we maximize the prefix sum sequences efficiently by leveraging the sorted order.
