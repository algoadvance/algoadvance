[Leetcode 3240. Minimum Number of Flips to Make Binary Grid Palindromic II full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3240)
## Problem Statement

The problem states that you are given a binary grid (a 2D array of '0's and '1's) and you need to determine the minimum number of flips required to make the entire grid palindromic. A flip involves changing a '0' to '1' or '1' to '0'. Note that a grid is considered palindromic if it reads the same forward and backward from both its rows and columns.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Dimensions**:
   - Is there a constraint on the size of the grid (e.g., max dimensions)?
   
2. **Examples**:
   - Can you provide a few examples of input grids and their expected outputs?

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - How do we handle edge cases where the grid is already palindromic or the grid is the smallest possible (1x1)?

Once we have clarity on the requirements, we can proceed to design the solution.

## Strategy

1. **Symmetry Check**:
   - Since the grid needs to be palindromic both row-wise and column-wise, we'll need to check the grid not only along the central row but also the central column.

2. **Count Mismatches**:
   - We need to traverse the grid and for each cell (i, j), compare it with its symmetric counterparts. For example, cell at (i, j) should match cells at (i, n-1-j), (m-1-i, j), and (m-1-i, n-1-j). If they are not the same, we count the mismatches.

3. **Calculate Minimum Flips**:
   - For each set of symmetric cells, decide the minimum number of flips required to make them identical.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minFlipsToMakeGridPalindromic(int[][] grid) {
        int rows = grid.length;
        int cols = grid[0].length;
        int flips = 0;
        
        // Iterate over half of the grid
        for (int i = 0; i < (rows + 1) / 2; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < (cols + 1) / 2; j++) {
                // Gather corresponding points in the grid
                int[] values = new int[4];
                values[0] = grid[i][j];
                values[1] = grid[i][cols - 1 - j];
                values[2] = grid[rows - 1 - i][j];
                values[3] = grid[rows - 1 - i][cols - 1 - j];
                
                // Count the number of 1s in these positions
                int countOnes = values[0] + values[1] + values[2] + values[3];
                flips += Math.min(countOnes, 4 - countOnes);
            }
        }
        return flips;
    }
    
    // Main for testing 
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[][] grid1 = { 
            {0, 1},
            {1, 0} 
        };
        System.out.println(sol.minFlipsToMakeGridPalindromic(grid1)); // Expected Output: 2
        
        int[][] grid2 = { 
            {1, 0, 0, 1},
            {0, 1, 1, 0},
            {0, 1, 1, 0},
            {1, 0, 0, 1}
        };
        System.out.println(sol.minFlipsToMakeGridPalindromic(grid2)); // Expected Output: 0
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this approach is O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid. This is because we need to traverse half of the grid and for each cell we are performing a constant amount of work (calculating flips).

This solution should efficiently handle the typical constraints expected in an interview setting.
