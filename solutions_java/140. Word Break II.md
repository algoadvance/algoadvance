[Leetcode 140. Word Break II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l140)
## Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` and a dictionary of strings `wordDict`. Add spaces in `s` to construct a sentence where each word is a valid dictionary word. Return all such possible sentences in any order.

Note that the same word in the dictionary may be reused multiple times in the segmentation.

### Example:

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "catsanddog", wordDict = ["cat","cats","and","sand","dog"]
Output: ["cats and dog","cat sand dog"]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "pineapplepenapple", wordDict = ["apple","pen","applepen","pine","pineapple"]
Output: ["pine apple pen apple","pineapple pen apple","pine applepen apple"]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: s = "catsandog", wordDict = ["cats","dog","sand","and","cat"]
Output: []
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: Is the wordDict always a non-empty list of non-empty strings?**
   - A: Yes, the dictionary contains at least one word and all words are non-empty.

2. **Q: Are there any constraints on the length of the string `s` or the words in the `wordDict`?**
   - A: `1 <= s.length <= 20`, `1 <= wordDict.length <= 1000`, `1 <= wordDict[i].length <= 20`.

3. **Q: Can `s` contain any characters other than lowercase a-z?**
   - A: No, `s` and all words in `wordDict` consist of lowercase English letters only.

## Strategy
We can solve this problem using a combination of Depth-First Search (DFS) and memoization. The idea is to explore all possible ways to break the string into valid words from the dictionary, but to avoid recomputation of results for the same substring, we can memoize the results.

The main steps are:
1. Use a DFS function to attempt to break down `s` starting at each position.
2. Check each possible prefix of the remaining string to see if it is in the `wordDict`.
3. If a prefix is found in `wordDict`, recursively resolve the rest of the string.
4. Use memoization to store results of substrings to avoid redundant computation.

## Code
Here is the Java implementation of the above strategy:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class WordBreakII {
    
    public List<String> wordBreak(String s, List<String> wordDict) {
        // Convert the wordDict into a set for faster lookup
        Set<String> wordSet = new HashSet<>(wordDict);
        // Memoization map
        Map<String, List<String>> memo = new HashMap<>();
        return dfs(s, wordSet, memo);
    }
    
    private List<String> dfs(String s, Set<String> wordSet, Map<String, List<String>> memo) {
        if (memo.containsKey(s)) {
            return memo.get(s);
        }
        
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        // When the string is empty, add an empty path to hold the words
        if (s.isEmpty()) {
            result.add("");
            return result;
        }
        
        for (String word : wordSet) {
            if (s.startsWith(word)) {
                String suffix = s.substring(word.length());
                List<String> subList = dfs(suffix, wordSet, memo);
                for (String sub : subList) {
                    String space = sub.isEmpty() ? "" : " ";
                    result.add(word + space + sub);
                }
            }
        }
        
        memo.put(s, result);
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        WordBreakII solution = new WordBreakII();
        List<String> wordDict1 = Arrays.asList("cat", "cats", "and", "sand", "dog");
        System.out.println(solution.wordBreak("catsanddog", wordDict1));
        
        List<String> wordDict2 = Arrays.asList("apple", "pen", "applepen", "pine", "pineapple");
        System.out.println(solution.wordBreak("pineapplepenapple", wordDict2));
        
        List<String> wordDict3 = Arrays.asList("cats", "dog", "sand", "and", "cat");
        System.out.println(solution.wordBreak("catsandog", wordDict3));
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is quite difficult to analyze precisely since it depends heavily on the structure of the input string `s` and the words in the `wordDict`. However, in the worst case, it is `O(N * 2^N)`, where `N` is the length of the string `s`. The exponential part arises because we are potentially exploring all possible ways to partition the string. Memoization helps to avoid recomputation of the same subproblems, which is beneficial mostly when `wordDict` can break down `s` into a large number of repeated subproblems.
