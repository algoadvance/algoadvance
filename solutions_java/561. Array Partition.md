[Leetcode 561. Array Partition](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l561)
### Problem Statement:

Given an integer array `nums` of `2n` integers, your task is to group these integers into `n` pairs `(a1, b1), (a2, b2), ..., (an, bn)` such that the sum of `min(ai, bi)` for all `i` is maximized. Return the maximized sum.

### Example:

1. Input: `nums = [1,4,3,2]`
   Output: `4`
   Explanation: `n` is 2, and the maximum sum of pairs is `min(1, 2) + min(3, 4) = 1 + 3 = 4`.

2. Input: `nums = [6,2,6,5,1,2]`
   Output: `9`
   Explanation: `n` is 3, and the maximum sum of pairs is `min(1, 2) + min(2, 5) + min(6, 6) = 1 + 2 + 6 = 9`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q**: What is the range of values in the array?
   **A**: The values can be any integer within the range defined by the problem constraints.

2. **Q**: Can `nums` contain duplicate elements?
   **A**: Yes, `nums` can have duplicate elements.

3. **Q**: Is the input array always guaranteed to be of even length?
   **A**: Yes, as per the problem description, the array length will be `2n`.

### Strategy:

1. **Sorting Approach**: 
   - Sort the array `nums`.
   - After sorting, pair elements in such a way that the smallest possible values are paired together.
   - Summing the first element of each pair will maximize the sum of `min(ai, bi)` as the minimum of each pair would always be the first element of the sorted pair, and it will accumulate the smallest values first.

### Code:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int arrayPairSum(int[] nums) {
        // Sort the array
        Arrays.sort(nums);

        int sum = 0;
        // Iterate through the array, taking every second element starting from index 0
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i += 2) {
            sum += nums[i];
        }
        
        return sum;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: The dominant step is the sorting of the array which takes `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of elements in the array `nums`.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity for this solution is `O(1)` if we do not account for the space taken by the sorting algorithm itself (assuming itâ€™s an in-place sort). Sorting typically requires `O(n)` space for auxiliary arrays if the sorting algorithm is not in-place.

This approach ensures that we achieve the maximum sum of `min(ai, bi)` for given pairs.
