[Leetcode 1352. Product of the Last K Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1352)
### Problem Statement
You are required to design an algorithm that implements a class `ProductOfNumbers` that supports the following operations:

1. `void add(int num)` - Appends the integer `num` to the end of the current list of numbers.
2. `int getProduct(int k)` - Returns the product of the last `k` numbers in the current list. You can assume that always the `add` operation will be called at least `k` times before calling `getProduct`.

**Constraints:**
- Each function call in `ProductOfNumbers`, `add`, and `getProduct` will have a time complexity of **O(1)**.
- There will be at most `4 * 10^4` calls to `add` and `getProduct`.
- The input values can be as large as `10^4`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the numbers in the list include zeros? **Yes**.
2. What should be the output of `getProduct(k)` if one or more of the last `k` numbers include zero? **Return 0** since the product of any number with zero is zero.

### Strategy
The key challenge here is to compute the product of the last `k` numbers efficiently. A brute force approach would involve iterating over the last `k` elements each time, which is not efficient.

Instead, we can use a prefix product array:
- Maintain an array `prefixProducts` where `prefixProducts[i]` is the product of all elements from the start up to the i-th element in the list.
- For `getProduct(k)`, the product of the last `k` numbers can be computed using the values in the `prefixProducts` list.

However, if there's a zero included in the last `k` elements, the product should be zero. To handle this efficiently, we can track the index of the last zero in the list.

### Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class ProductOfNumbers {
    List<Integer> prefixProducts;
    int lastZeroIndex;

    public ProductOfNumbers() {
        prefixProducts = new ArrayList<>();
        prefixProducts.add(1);  // To handle initial product calculations
        lastZeroIndex = -1;
    }

    public void add(int num) {
        if (num == 0) {
            lastZeroIndex = prefixProducts.size() - 1;
            prefixProducts.add(1);
        } else {
            int lastProduct = prefixProducts.get(prefixProducts.size() - 1);
            prefixProducts.add(lastProduct * num);
        }
    }

    public int getProduct(int k) {
        int size = prefixProducts.size();
        if (size - 1 - k <= lastZeroIndex) {
            return 0;
        }
        return prefixProducts.get(size - 1) / prefixProducts.get(size - 1 - k);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **add(num)**: O(1) - Adding a number, updating the prefix product.
- **getProduct(k)**: O(1) - Accessing the `prefixProducts` list and performing a division operation to get the product of the last `k` numbers.

This implementation ensures that both operations run in constant time as required by the problem constraints.
