[Leetcode 1503. Last Moment Before All Ants Fall Out of a Plank](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1503)
### Problem Statement
You are given a plank of length `n` and two arrays of integers `left` and `right` which represent the positions of ants moving to the left and right respectively. There are no ants at the start or the end of the plank.

Assuming the ants don't interfere with each other (i.e., they keep moving until they fall off the plank), we want to determine the **last moment** when any ant is still on the plank.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can ants pass through each other or do they turn around when they meet?**
   - Ants may potentially meet, but for simplicity, we assume they do not interfere with each other as per the problem statement.
   
2. **What is the range of values for `n`, `left`, and `right`?**
   - Typically, constraints such as `1 <= n <= 10^4` and the lengths of `left` and `right` arrays can be up to 10^4 respectively, based on common problem constraints.

3. **Are the arrays `left` and `right` guaranteed to contain only valid positions on the plank?**
   - Yes, all positions are between 0 and `n`, exclusive.

### Strategy
Given that ants move without interference, the last moment an ant is on the plank will be the maximum time any one ant takes to fall off. 

- For ants in `left`, the time for them to fall off is their position.
- For ants in `right`, the time for them to fall off is `(n - position)`.

Thus, the solution is to find the maximum value from these two computed times.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int getLastMoment(int n, int[] left, int[] right) {
        int lastMoment = 0;
        
        // Calculate the maximum time for ants in the left array
        for (int l : left) {
            lastMoment = Math.max(lastMoment, l);
        }
        
        // Calculate the maximum time for ants in the right array
        for (int r : right) {
            lastMoment = Math.max(lastMoment, n - r);
        }
        
        return lastMoment;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The solution involves a single pass through the `left` and `right` arrays to find the maximum value, so the time complexity is:

- **O(L + R)**, where `L` is the length of `left` and `R` is the length of `right`.

This is efficient given the typical constraints.

### Example
Consider a plank of length `n = 5`, with `left = [4, 3]` and `right = [0, 1]`.

- For `left`, the times are: 4, 3.
- For `right`, the times are: 5-0, 5-1 => 5, 4.

Thus, the maximum time to fall off for any ant is `max(4, 3, 5, 4) = 5`, and therefore the last moment before all ants fall off is 5.
