[Leetcode 937. Reorder Data in Log Files](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l937)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of `logs`. Each log is a space-delimited string of words, where the first word is an identifier.

There are two types of logs:
1. **Letter-logs:** All words (except the identifier) consist of lowercase English letters.
2. **Digit-logs:** All words (except the identifier) consist of digits.

Reorder these logs such that:
1. The **letter-logs** come before all **digit-logs**.
2. The **letter-logs** are sorted lexicographically by their contents. If their contents are the same, then sort them lexicographically by their identifiers.
3. The **digit-logs** should retain their relative ordering.

Return the final order of the logs.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the size of the array or the logs?
   **A:** The number of logs is between `1` and `100`. Each log is a non-empty string with at most `100` characters.

2. **Q:** Are the identifiers guaranteed to be unique?
   **A:** Yes, each identifier is unique.

3. **Q:** Are all logs guaranteed to be either letter-logs or digit-logs?
   **A:** Yes.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. **Separate the Logs:** First, distinguish between letter-logs and digit-logs.
2. **Sort the Letter-logs:** Sort the letter-logs first by their contents, and in case of ties, by their identifiers.
3. **Concatenate the Results:** Combine the sorted letter-logs and the original order digit-logs.

We'll use a custom comparator to handle the sorting of the logs. 

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public String[] reorderLogFiles(String[] logs) {
        // Separate logs into letter-logs and digit-logs
        List<String> letterLogs = new ArrayList<>();
        List<String> digitLogs = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (String log : logs) {
            String[] parts = log.split(" ", 2);
            if (Character.isDigit(parts[1].charAt(0))) {
                digitLogs.add(log);
            } else {
                letterLogs.add(log);
            }
        }
        
        // Sort the letter logs
        Collections.sort(letterLogs, (log1, log2) -> {
            String[] split1 = log1.split(" ", 2);
            String[] split2 = log2.split(" ", 2);
            int cmp = split1[1].compareTo(split2[1]);
            if (cmp != 0) return cmp;
            return split1[0].compareTo(split2[0]);
        });

        // Combine the sorted letter logs with the digit logs
        String[] result = new String[logs.length];
        int index = 0;
        for (String log : letterLogs) {
            result[index++] = log;
        }
        for (String log : digitLogs) {
            result[index++] = log;
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Separating Logs:** O(n) because each log is processed once.
2. **Sorting Letter-logs:** O(m log m) where `m` is the number of letter-logs. Each comparison involves checking the contents which is limited to the length of the logs.
3. **Combining Logs:** O(n) to concatenate the results.

Overall, the time complexity is O(n + m log m), where n is the total number of logs and m is the number of letter-logs (m <= n). The space complexity is O(n) for storing the separated logs.
