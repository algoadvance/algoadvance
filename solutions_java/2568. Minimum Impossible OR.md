[Leetcode 2568. Minimum Impossible OR](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2568)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `arr`. Your task is to find the smallest positive integer that cannot be represented as the bitwise OR of one or more elements from the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for the elements in `arr`?**
   - The values can be positive integers.
2. **What is the length range of the array `arr`?**
   - The array length is not specified, but we can assume it to be reasonably large since it is a competitive programming problem.
3. **Can there be duplicate values in the array?**
   - Yes, duplicates are allowed.
4. **Can the array be empty?**
   - Since we are looking for the smallest positive integer that can't be represented, an empty array would mean the smallest integer is `1`.

### Strategy

1. **Understand OR operations**:
   - The OR operation combines bits such that if any bit in the position is `1`, the result is `1`.
   - Hence, the OR of any subset will have its bits set if any of the bits in its positions from the subset elements were set.

2. **Tracking Results via OR Bit Masking**:
   - Utilize a set to keep track of all results that can be derived using OR operations on subsets of the array.
   - For each element in the array, compute the OR combination with all existing results and add them to the set.
   - Also add the element itself to the set, as each element alone is a valid OR result.

3. **Identify the Smallest Missing Positive Integer**:
   - Start checking from `1` upwards to find the smallest integer that isn't present in the OR results set.

### Code
```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class MinimumImpossibleORout {

    public static int minImpossibleOR(int[] arr) {
        Set<Integer> orResults = new HashSet<>();

        // Inserting initial elements
        for (int num : arr) {
            Set<Integer> newResults = new HashSet<>();
            newResults.add(num);
            
            for (int orResult : orResults) {
                newResults.add(orResult | num);
            }
            orResults.addAll(newResults);
        }

        // Starting from 1, find the smallest missing positive integer
        int smallestMissingPositive = 1;
        while (orResults.contains(smallestMissingPositive)) {
            smallestMissingPositive++;
        }

        return smallestMissingPositive;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr1 = {5, 1, 2};
        System.out.println(minImpossibleOR(arr1)); // Expected output: 4

        int[] arr2 = {1, 2, 3};
        System.out.println(minImpossibleOR(arr2)); // Expected output: 7
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

**Time Complexity:**
- Let `n` be the number of elements in the array.
- Each element can potentially contribute to new OR results for every current OR result.
- In the worst case, the number of OR results can grow exponentially.

The complexity theoretically can be `O(2^n)` due to exponential growth of the set. This approach, while straightforward, may be optimized under constraints or specific input properties. Nonetheless, for practical inputs and constraints typical in interview problems, the approach may work efficiently.

**Space Complexity:**
- We store all unique OR results in a set, and in the worst case, this takes `O(2^n)` space. 

### Summary

The solution leverages the properties of the OR bitwise operation and a set to track all possible outcomes. By iterating through possible positive integers and checking against the set, it yields the smallest missing positive integer efficiently for practical cases.
