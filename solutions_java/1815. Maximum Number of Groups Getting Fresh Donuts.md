[Leetcode 1815. Maximum Number of Groups Getting Fresh Donuts](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1815)
### Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer `batchSize` and an array `groups` of positive integers. Each integer in `groups` represents the number of people in a group that you want to place into a batch for eating donuts. Each batch must have a size that is a multiple of `batchSize`, so each group can join one batch. 

Return the maximum number of batches you can achieve if each group joins a batch exactly once.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum size for batchSize and groups?**
   - This isn't explicitly stated in the problem but usually, constraints are provided in the problem description on platforms like LeetCode. Assuming typical constraints like `1 <= batchSize <= 10`, `1 <= groups.length <= 30`, `1 <= groups[i] <= 10^9`.

2. **Is the order of the groups important?**
   - No, the order of groups does not matter.

3. **Can groups be split up to fit into different batches?**
   - No, each group must be placed into a batch in its entirety.

### Strategy

1. **Modulo Operation**:
   - First, for each group size, compute the remainder when divided by `batchSize`. This helps us understand which groups can be combined to form a complete batch.

2. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Use dynamic programming to handle the many combinations of groups that could potentially form complete batches.
   - Utilize memoization to store and re-use results of subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

3. **Greedy Approach**:
   - Intuitively, pairs of groups that together form a complete batch (i.e., their remainders sum to `batchSize`) should be placed together.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    public int maxHappyGroups(int batchSize, int[] groups) {
        int[] count = new int[batchSize];
        
        // Count the number of groups that have certain remainders
        for (int group : groups) {
            count[group % batchSize]++;
        }
        
        // One immediate optimization: groups that are already a multiple of batchSize
        int answer = count[0];
        count[0] = 0;

        // Memoization to reduce repeated computation
        Map<String, Integer> memo = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Explore all possibilities with the memoization helper
        return answer + dfs(count, memo, batchSize, 0);
    }
    
    private int dfs(int[] count, Map<String, Integer> memo, int batchSize, int start) {
        // Memoization key based on the current state of "count" array
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (int cnt : count) {
            sb.append(cnt).append(",");
        }
        String key = sb.toString();
        if (memo.containsKey(key)) {
            return memo.get(key);
        }

        // Choice: Try to place any group i with non-zero remainder count i
        int maxBatch = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < batchSize; i++) {
            if (count[i] > 0) {
                count[i]--;
                int result = dfs(count, memo, batchSize, (start + i) % batchSize);
                maxBatch = Math.max(maxBatch, result + ((start == 0) ? 1 : 0)); // Add 1 if we complete a batch
                count[i]++;
            }
        }
        
        memo.put(key, maxBatch);
        return maxBatch;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Exponential with memoization**:
  - The DFS method might have to explore `batchSize` possibilities for each of the `batchSize` elements in `count`.
  - In the worst case, the complexity without memoization would be `O(batchSize^batchSize)`.
  - Using memoization tends to drastically reduce average-case scenarios to something more manageable, typically making it feasible within the provided constraints.

### Conclusion

This problem is a variant of the subset-sum problem tailored for dynamic programming and memoization strategies to find the optimal arrangement of groupings. Ensuring that you keep track of previously calculated states helps in efficiently solving this problem.
