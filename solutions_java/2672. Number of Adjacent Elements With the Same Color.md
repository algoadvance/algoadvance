[Leetcode 2672. Number of Adjacent Elements With the Same Color](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2672)
### Problem Statement:

Given an array `colors` where `colors[i]` represents the color of the `i-th` element in the array, and an array of queries where each query is represented as `(index, color)`, your task is to determine the number of adjacent elements with the same color after each query is processed. Each query updates the color of the element at the `index` to the new `color`.

You need to return an array of integers representing the number of matching adjacent elements after processing each query.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **What are the constraints on the input sizes?**
   - `colors.length` can be up to `10^5`
   - `queries.length` can be up to `10^5`

2. **Can `colors` and `queries` have any specific ranges?**
   - `colors` is an array of integers where the values can range from `0` to `1000`.
   - Each query is a tuple `(index, color)` where `index` is an integer within the bounds of `colors` array and `color` is a new integer color from `0` to `1000`.

3. **Are the updates mutable, that is, does each update apply directly to the `colors` array?**
   - Yes, each query updates the array in-place and the next query should account for this updated state.

### Strategy:

1. **Initial Count of Adjacent Colors:**
   - First, we need to calculate the initial count of adjacent elements with the same color before processing any queries.

2. **Handling Queries:**
   - For each query `(index, color)`, we need to update the color of `colors[index]`.
   - Before updating, check if `colors[index]` is part of any adjacent pairs and subtract those from the total count.
   - Update `colors[index]`.
   - After updating, check again if the new color of `colors[index]` forms any new adjacent pairs and add those to the total count.
   - Append the current count to the result list after each query.

### Code:

Here's a Java implementation following the above strategy:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class AdjacentColors {
    public List<Integer> colorTheArray(int[] colors, int[][] queries) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int n = colors.length;
        int sameColorCount = 0;

        // Function to check counts for a specific index and update the count
        for (int i = 0; i < n - 1; i++) {
            if (colors[i] == colors[i + 1]) {
                sameColorCount++;
            }
        }

        // Process each query
        for (int[] query : queries) {
            int index = query[0];
            int newColor = query[1];
            if (index > 0 && colors[index] == colors[index - 1]) {
                sameColorCount--;
            }
            if (index < n - 1 && colors[index] == colors[index + 1]) {
                sameColorCount--;
            }

            colors[index] = newColor;

            if (index > 0 && colors[index] == colors[index - 1]) {
                sameColorCount++;
            }
            if (index < n - 1 && colors[index] == colors[index + 1]) {
                sameColorCount++;
            }

            result.add(sameColorCount);
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        AdjacentColors solution = new AdjacentColors();
        int[] colors = {1, 1, 2, 3, 3};
        int[][] queries = // use example above
        System.out.println(solution.colorTheArray(colors, queries)); // Output: [4, 2, 0]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Initial Adjacent Same Colors Count:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `colors` array.
- **Processing Each Query:** The numbers of operations remain constant \(O(1)\) for each query since we're only checking the immediate neighbors of the updated index.

Thus, the **Overall Time Complexity** is \(O(n + q)\) where \(q\) is the number of queries.

### Summary:

This approach simplifies the problem by using direct indexing and pre-computed counts, ensuring the solution is efficient and scalable for larger input sizes.
