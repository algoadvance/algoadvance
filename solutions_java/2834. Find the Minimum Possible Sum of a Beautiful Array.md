[Leetcode 2834. Find the Minimum Possible Sum of a Beautiful Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2834)
## Problem Statement

Given two positive integers `n` and `target`, the task is to find the minimum possible sum of an array `arr` of size `n` such that:

1. `arr` is a "Beautiful Array."
2. Each element of `arr` is a distinct positive integer.
3. No two different indices `i` and `j` exist such that `arr[i] + arr[j] == target`.

An array is considered "Beautiful" if it satisfies the conditions above.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for `n` and `target`?**
   - Assume n and target are positive integers.
   
2. **Is there a constraint on the maximum integer value that elements of the array can take?**
   - The problem doesn't mention a maximum value, but we'll aim to use the smallest distinct integers to minimize the sum.

## Strategy

1. **Generate the smallest distinct positive integers:** Start from 1 and continue to add numbers to the array.
2. **Avoid pairs that sum up to `target`:** Skip numbers if adding them would create a pair with any previous number that sums up to the target.

Here's a step-by-step strategy:

- Initialize an empty array.
- Use a variable to track the next smallest number to consider adding to the array.
- Loop until the array contains `n` elements:
  - Check if adding the current number would form a forbidden pair with any element already in the array.
  - If yes, skip this number.
  - If no, add it to the array.
- Compute the sum of the elements in the array and return it.

## Code

```java
import java.util.HashSet;

public class MinimumPossibleSum {
    public static int findMinimumSum(int n, int target) {
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        int currentNumber = 1;
        int sum = 0;
        
        while (set.size() < n) {
            boolean hasPair = false;
            for (int num : set) {
                if (num + currentNumber == target) {
                    hasPair = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!hasPair) {
                set.add(currentNumber);
                sum += currentNumber;
            }
            currentNumber++;
        }
        
        return sum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 3;
        int target = 5;
        System.out.println(findMinimumSum(n, target)); // Example test case
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The algorithm employs a while loop that continues until `n` distinct elements have been added to the set.
- For each candidate number, it checks against all current elements in the set in the worst case, which makes this an O(n^2) operation in the worst-case scenario.

Given the constraints, this should be efficient enough for typical interview problem sizes.

## Summary

This solution ensures that the generated array minimizes the sum while adhering to the constraints of being "Beautiful". The approach uses a set to maintain uniqueness and checks sums to enforce the target condition. The solution computes the smallest possible sum effectively within the described constraints.
