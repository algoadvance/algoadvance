[Leetcode 1137. N](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1137)
### Problem Statement:
The Tribonacci sequence T(n) is defined as follows: 
- T(0) = 0, T(1) = 1, T(2) = 1,
- and T(n+3) = T(n) + T(n+1) + T(n+2) for n >= 0.

Given `n`, return the value of T(n).

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Range**: What is the expected range of `n`? 
   - Usually, `n` will be a non-negative integer, and typical edge cases include values like 0, 1, 2.
2. **Efficiency**: Are there any constraints on time or space complexity we should consider?
   - For example, should we optimize for large `n` values, or is a straightforward approach sufficient?
3. **Input Validation**: Do we need to validate the input for non-integer values or negative numbers?
   - Generally assumed to be non-negative integers as per the problem statement.

### Strategy:
- Since the Tribonacci sequence follows a specific pattern, a dynamic programming approach can be employed.
- We will use an iterative approach to compute the Tribonacci number for given `n`, storing interim results to avoid recomputation.

### Code:
```java
public class Tribonacci {

    public static int tribonacci(int n) {
        if (n == 0) return 0;
        if (n == 1 || n == 2) return 1;
        
        int a = 0, b = 1, c = 1, d = 0;
        
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            d = a + b + c;  // Compute the next Tribonacci value
            a = b;  // Update values for the next iteration
            b = c;
            c = d;
        }
        
        return d;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test cases
        int n = 4;
        System.out.println("T(" + n + ") = " + tribonacci(n));  // Output: 4

        n = 25;
        System.out.println("T(" + n + ") = " + tribonacci(n));  // Output: 1389537
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: The loop runs `n-2` times, which is linear in time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: 
  - **O(1)**: We are using a constant amount of space (variables a, b, c, d).

Each of these variables is updated in each iteration, so we do not need extra space that grows with `n`.

This approach efficiently computes the N-th Tribonacci number using iteration and simple state update.
