[Leetcode 991. Broken Calculator](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l991)
### Problem Statement

LeetCode 991: **Broken Calculator**

There is a broken calculator that has the integer starting value `X` and returns the result `Y` as follows:

- Multiply `X` by 2.
- Subtract 1 from `X`.

Write a program to determine the minimum number of operations to display the number `Y` on the calculator, starting from the number `X`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can `X` and `Y` be negative numbers?
   - **A:** No, both `X` and `Y` are non-negative integers.

2. **Q:** Is there a constraint range for `X` and `Y`?
   - **A:** Yes, typically in problems like these, you'd assume up to around 10^9.

3. **Q:** Can `Y` be less than `X`?
   - **A:** Yes, which means only subtraction operations will be needed.

### Strategy

A good strategy here is a **reverse approach**; instead of transforming `X` to `Y`, we will transform `Y` to `X`:

1. If `Y` is greater than `X`:
   - If `Y` is even, divide it by 2 (reverse operation of multiplication by 2).
   - If `Y` is odd, increment it by 1 (reverse operation of subtraction by 1).

2. If `Y` is less than `X`, only subtraction is needed because we cannot use a multiply-by-2 to simplify the process.

We iterate until we make `Y` equal to `X`.

### Code

Here is an implementation of the above strategy:

```java
public class BrokenCalculator {
    public int brokenCalc(int X, int Y) {
        int operations = 0;
        while (Y > X) {
            operations++;
            if (Y % 2 == 0) {
                Y /= 2;
            } else {
                Y += 1;
            }
        }
        return operations + (X - Y);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        BrokenCalculator bc = new BrokenCalculator();
        System.out.println(bc.brokenCalc(2, 3));  // output should be 2
        System.out.println(bc.brokenCalc(5, 8));  // output should be 2
        System.out.println(bc.brokenCalc(3, 10));  // output should be 3
        System.out.println(bc.brokenCalc(1024, 1));  // output should be 1023
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity for this algorithm is **O(log Y)** since we are essentially halving `Y` (or incrementing it in the case of odd numbers) in each step. This logarithmic behavior stems from the divide-by-2 operation.
