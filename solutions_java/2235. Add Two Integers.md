[Leetcode 2235. Add Two Integers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2235)
### Problem Statement:
You are given two integers `num1` and `num2` representing two integers. Implement a function that returns the sum of `num1` and `num2`.

**Example:**
```text
Input: num1 = 12, num2 = 5
Output: 17
```
```text
Input: num1 = -10, num2 = 4
Output: -6
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Are `num1` and `num2` guaranteed to be non-null?
    - Yes, both integers are always provided and valid.
2. Can `num1` and `num2` be negative?
    - Yes, they can be negative.
3. What is the range of `num1` and `num2`?
    - They are within the range of a typical 32-bit signed integer.

### Strategy:
The problem is straightforward. The task is to return the sum of the two integers. This can be achieved by simply using the `+` operator in Java.

### Code:
```java
public class Solution {
    public int sum(int num1, int num2) {
        return num1 + num2;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.sum(12, 5)); // Output: 17
        System.out.println(solution.sum(-10, 4)); // Output: -6
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity for this function is **O(1)** because adding two integers is a constant time operation.

### Space Complexity:
The space complexity is **O(1)** since no extra space is used beyond the input integers and the output value.
