## Problem Statement

**284. Peeking Iterator**

Given an Iterator class interface with methods: `next()` and `hasNext()`, design and implement a PeekingIterator that supports the `peek()` operation. 

Implement the PeekingIterator class:

- `PeekingIterator(Iterator<E> iterator)` Initializes the object with the given iterator.
- `E peek()` Returns the next element in the iteration without advancing the iterator.
- `E next()` Returns the next element and advances the iterator.
- `boolean hasNext()` Returns `true` if the iteration has more elements.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What type does the iterator operate on?**
   - The iterator will typically operate on a generic type `E`.

2. **What should happen if `peek()` is called when there are no more elements?**
   - This should be handled gracefully. Normally, we assume we won't call `peek()` or `next()` if `hasNext()` is `false`.

3. **Is it guaranteed that the input iterator is not null?**
   - Yes, you can assume the input iterator is not null.

## Strategy

To implement the `PeekingIterator` class, we need to store the next element so that the `peek()` function can return it without advancing the iterator. This requires maintaining an internal state and ensuring the iterator's position is only advanced when `next()` is called.

Here's a step-by-step strategy:

1. **Store the Iterator:** Store the reference of the input iterator.
2. **Preload the First Element:** Fetch the first element during the initialization to support `peek()`.
3. **Implement `peek()` Method:** Return the preloaded element without advancing the iterator.
4. **Implement `next()` Method:** Return the preloaded element and fetch the next element for future operations.
5. **Implement `hasNext()` Method:** Simply check if the preloaded element (or cache) is available.

## Code Implementation

```java
import java.util.Iterator;

class PeekingIterator<E> implements Iterator<E> {
    private Iterator<E> iterator;
    private E nextElement;
    private boolean hasNext;

    public PeekingIterator(Iterator<E> iterator) {
        this.iterator = iterator;
        if (iterator.hasNext()) {
            nextElement = iterator.next();
            hasNext = true;
        } else {
            hasNext = false;
        }
    }

    public E peek() {
        return nextElement;
    }

    @Override
    public E next() {
        E result = nextElement;
        if (iterator.hasNext()) {
            nextElement = iterator.next();
        } else {
            hasNext = false;
        }
        return result;
    }

    @Override
    public boolean hasNext() {
        return hasNext;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Initialization (`PeekingIterator`)**: O(1) – Initializing and preloading the first element is done in constant time.
2. **Peek (`peek`)**: O(1) – Simply returns the preloaded element.
3. **Next (`next`)**: O(1) – Returns the preloaded element and fetches the next one in constant time.
4. **HasNext (`hasNext`)**: O(1) – Simply returns the boolean flag.

The space complexity is O(1) since we are using a minimal amount of extra space for storing the element and a boolean flag.
