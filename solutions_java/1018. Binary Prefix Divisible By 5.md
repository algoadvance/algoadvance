[Leetcode 1018. Binary Prefix Divisible By 5](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1018)
### Problem Statement
You are given a binary array `A` (an array of 0s and 1s).

A binary prefix is any array that can be obtained by removing some (possibly none) elements from the end of the array.

Return a list of `boolean`s `answer`, where `answer[i]` is true if the binary number represented by the prefix `A[0] to A[i]` is divisible by 5.

### Example
**Input**: `A = [0,1,1]`  
**Output**: `[true,false,false]`  
**Explanation**:  
- The input array is [0, 1, 1].
- The prefix "0" is "0" in binary, which is 0 in decimal. 0 is divisible by 5.
- The prefix "01" is "1" in binary, which is 1 in decimal. 1 is not divisible by 5.
- The prefix "011" is "3" in binary, which is 3 in decimal. 3 is not divisible by 5.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can `A` contain only 0s and 1s?
   - Yes, `A` is a binary array.
2. What is the maximum size of the array `A`?
   - According to typical competitive programming constraints, let's assume the size of `A` can be up to `10000`.
3. Should the function return the results for each prefix in the same order?
   - Yes, the output list should correspond to the prefix ending at each index in the input list.

### Strategy
1. To determine if a prefix is divisible by 5, we do not need to convert the whole binary prefix to a decimal number explicitly.
2. We can keep track of the current number modulo 5 (`current_number % 5`), and update this residue as we iterate through the array.
3. When a new bit is added to the current number, we can update the residue using the equation:
   - `current_number = current_number * 2 + A[i]`
   - `current_number % 5 = (current_number * 2 + A[i]) % 5`
4. We can directly calculate `(current_number * 2 + A[i]) % 5` by using modular arithmetic properties.
5. If `current_number % 5` is 0 at any step, it indicates that the number formed by the current prefix is divisible by 5.

### Code
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public List<Boolean> prefixesDivBy5(int[] A) {
        List<Boolean> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int currentNumber = 0;
        
        for (int bit : A) {
            currentNumber = (currentNumber * 2 + bit) % 5;
            result.add(currentNumber == 0);
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] A = {0, 1, 1};
        System.out.println(sol.prefixesDivBy5(A)); // [true, false, false]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of array `A`. Each element is processed once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the result list `answer`.
