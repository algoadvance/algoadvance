[Leetcode 1372. Longest ZigZag Path in a Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1372)
### Problem Statement

You are given a binary tree root. A ZigZag path for a binary tree is defined as follows:
- Choose any node in the binary tree and a direction (left or right).
- If the current direction is left, move to the left child of the current node; otherwise, move to the right child of the current node.
- Change the direction from left to right or right to left.
- Repeat the second step until you cannot move in the desired direction.

The ZigZag length is defined as the number of nodes visited - 1. 

Return the longest ZigZag path contained in that tree.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Tree Structure:**
   - Are there any specific constraints on the binary tree (e.g., height, number of nodes)?
     - **Answer:** The tree will not have any specific constraints other than being a valid binary tree. It could be any size.
2. **Node Values:**
   - Are the values of the nodes relevant to determining the ZigZag path?
     - **Answer:** No, the values of the nodes are irrelevant. Only the structure of the tree matters.
3. **Starting Point:**
   - Can the ZigZag path start from any node or just the root?
     - **Answer:** While the problem primarily implies starting from the root, any subtree can be considered for finding the longest path.

### Strategy
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** Use DFS to traverse the tree.
2. **State Tracking:** During traversal, track the direction (left or right) of the last move.
3. **Recursive Function:** Define a recursive function that keeps track of the length of the current ZigZag path and the direction of the previous move.
4. **Direction Switching:** Switch directions at each step and keep updating the maximum length of the ZigZag path found.
5. **Post-Traversal:** After the DFS, the maximum ZigZag path length should be stored in a global variable which is returned as the result.

### Code
```java
class Solution {
    private int maxZigZag = 0;

    public int longestZigZag(TreeNode root) {
        if (root == null) return 0;
        dfs(root, "left", 0);
        dfs(root, "right", 0);
        return maxZigZag;
    }

    private void dfs(TreeNode node, String direction, int length) {
        if (node == null) {
            return;
        }

        maxZigZag = Math.max(maxZigZag, length);

        // If we came from the left, we now go to the right, and vice versa
        if (direction.equals("left")) {
            dfs(node.right, "right", length + 1);
            dfs(node.left, "left", 1); // reset for a new potential path
        } else {
            dfs(node.left, "left", length + 1);
            dfs(node.right, "right", 1); // reset for a new potential path
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once during the depth-first traversal.
- **Space Complexity:** O(H), where H is the height of the tree. This space is used by the call stack during the recursive depth-first search.

By traversing the tree using DFS and switching directions at each step, we can determine the maximum length of any ZigZag path in the tree. This solution ensures we cover all potential paths and track the longest found.
