[Leetcode 1780. Check if Number is a Sum of Powers of Three](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1780)
### Problem Statement
1780. Check if Number is a Sum of Powers of Three

Given an integer `n`, return `true` if you can represent `n` as the sum of distinct powers of three. Otherwise, return `false`.

An integer is a power of three if it is of the form `3^x` where `x` is a non-negative integer.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the input integer `n`?**
   The input `n` is a non-negative integer up to \(10^9\).

2. **Are there constraints related to performance we should be aware of?**
   Yes, the solution should be efficient due to the potential size of `n`.

3. **Is `0` a valid input?**
   Yes, and according to the problem statement, `0` is considered to be representable as an empty sum of powers of three (so it should return `true`).

### Strategy
We can solve this problem by performing a greedy approach:
1. Starting from the largest power of three that is less than or equal to `n`, try to subtract it from `n`.
2. Repeat the process for the next largest power of three until we either reduce `n` to zero or have exhausted all powers of three less than or equal to the original `n`.

#### Steps:
1. Compute all powers of three less than or equal to `n` and store them in a list.
2. Traverse the list from the largest power to the smallest power:
   - Subtract the current power of three from `n` if it is less than or equal to `n`.
   - If at any point `n` equals to zero, return `true`.
3. If the traversal completes without reducing `n` to zero, return `false`.

### Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class CheckSumOfPowersOfThree {
    public boolean checkPowersOfThree(int n) {
        // Step 1: Generate all powers of three up to the limit
        List<Integer> powersOfThree = new ArrayList<>();
        int power = 1;
        
        while (power <= n) {
            powersOfThree.add(power);
            if (Integer.MAX_VALUE / 3 < power) break;
            power *= 3;
        }

        // Step 2: Try to subtract the largest powers of three first
        for (int i = powersOfThree.size() - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (n >= powersOfThree.get(i)) {
                n -= powersOfThree.get(i);
            }
        }
        
        // Step 3: If n is reduced to zero, we successfully represented it
        return n == 0;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CheckSumOfPowersOfThree sol = new CheckSumOfPowersOfThree();
        
        // Test cases
        System.out.println(sol.checkPowersOfThree(12));  // true, because 12 = 3^1 + 3^2
        System.out.println(sol.checkPowersOfThree(91));  // true, because 91 = 3^0 + 3^2 + 3^4
        System.out.println(sol.checkPowersOfThree(21));  // false, no such combination
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Precomputation:** The loop to generate powers of three runs in \(\mathcal{O}(\log_3 n)\), as each power of three is exponentially larger.
- **Subtraction Loop:** We traverse the precomputed powers of three in \(\mathcal{O}(\log_3 n)\).

Hence, the overall time complexity is \( \mathcal{O}(\log_3 n) \).

### Additional Notes
This approach ensures that we are always checking the largest possible powers first, which helps to quickly reduce `n` and makes the algorithm efficient.
