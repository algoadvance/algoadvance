[Leetcode 2594. Minimum Time to Repair Cars](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2594)
### Problem Statement:

You are given `n` cars that all need to be repaired. You are also given an array `ranks` of length `m`, where `ranks[i]` represents the efficiency rank of the `i-th` mechanic. The time it takes for the `i-th` mechanic to repair a car is proportional to the square of their rank (i.e., `ranks[i] * cars^2`).

Your task is to find the minimum amount of time required to repair all `n` cars. Each mechanic can repair any number of cars, but only one at a time.

### Clarifying Questions:

Before jumping into the solution, letâ€™s make sure we understand the requirements clearly:

1. **How is the mechanic efficiency rank given?** 
   - It is given as an array where each element represents the rank of a mechanic.

2. **Can mechanics repair cars concurrently?**
   - Yes, each mechanic can repair cars concurrently and independently from one another, but they can handle only one car at a time.

3. **Is there a limit on the number of cars a mechanic can repair?**
   - No explicit limit has been mentioned. The division and optimization come from the problem constraints and requirements.

### Strategy:

We need to minimize the total time to repair all `n` cars. To find this minimum time, we can use a binary search approach which effectively narrows down the range of possible times.

Here is the high-level strategy:
1. **Binary Search Initialization**:
   - Initialize the search range for possible minimum times from `1` to `ranks[0] * n^2` (the worst case where the least efficient mechanic repairs all cars).
   
2. **Binary Search Execution**:
   - For each midpoint time in the binary search, calculate the maximum number of cars each mechanic can repair within that timeframe.
   - Sum the number of cars that can be repaired by all mechanics within the midpoint time.
   - If the total number of cars repaired is at least `n`, adjust the search space to explore potentially smaller times.
   - Otherwise, increase the lower bound of the search space.

3. **Feasibility Function**:
   - A function to calculate the maximum number of cars each mechanic can repair within a given time `T`.

### Code:

```java
public class MinimumTimeToRepairCars {
    public static long minTimeToRepairCars(int[] ranks, int n) {
        int m = ranks.length;
        long left = 1;
        long right = (long) ranks[0] * n * n;
        
        while (left < right) {
            long mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if (canRepairAllCars(ranks, n, mid)) {
                right = mid;
            } else {
                left = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }

    private static boolean canRepairAllCars(int[] ranks, int n, long timeLimit) {
        long totalCars = 0;
        for (int rank : ranks) {
            totalCars += Math.sqrt((double) timeLimit / rank);
            if (totalCars >= n) return true;
        }
        return totalCars >= n;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] ranks = {4, 2, 3, 1};
        int n = 10;
        System.out.println(minTimeToRepairCars(ranks, n));  // Output the minimum required time
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Binary Search Operations**: Each step of binary search requires log(T) operations, where `T` is the range of search space. In this problem, T can be as large as `ranks[0] * n^2`.
- **Feasibility Check**: Checking feasibility involves iterating through all `m` mechanics, calculating the number of cars each can repair for the given mid value, which takes O(m) time.

Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(m * log(ranks[0] * n^2))`.

### Summary:

We use a binary search method combined with a feasibility function to efficiently determine the minimum time required to repair all cars using the given mechanic ranks. This approach leverages the sorted nature inherently provided by binary searching over a computed range of possible times.
