[Leetcode 1461. Check If a String Contains All Binary Codes of Size K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1461)
## Problem Statement

Given a binary string `s` and an integer `k`, return `true` if every binary code of length `k` is a substring of `s`. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Example
**Example 1:**
- Input: `s = "00110110"`, `k = 2`
- Output: `true`
- Explanation: The binary codes of length 2 are "00", "01", "10" and "11". They all are present as substrings.

**Example 2:**
- Input: `s = "0110"`, `k = 1`
- Output: `true`
- Explanation: The binary codes of length 1 are "0" and "1", which are present as substrings.

**Example 3:**
- Input: `s = "0110"`, `k = 2`
- Output: `false`
- Explanation: The binary code "00" is missing.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the input string guaranteed to only contain '0's and '1's?**
   - Yes, the problem specifies the input as a binary string.
  
2. **What are the constraints on the length of the string `s` and the integer `k`?**
   - This can affect the efficiency of the solution. Typically, the constraints on LeetCode are:
     - `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^5`
     - `1 <= k <= 20`

3. **Can the integer `k` be larger than the length of the string `s`?**
   - No, if `k` is larger than the length of the string `s`, it immediately follows that not all binary codes of that length could be present.

## Strategy
1. **Understand the task**: There are \(2^k\) possible binary codes of size `k`. We need to determine if all of these codes are present as substrings in `s`.
2. **Sliding Window Approach**:
   - Use a sliding window of size `k` to capture all possible substrings of length `k`.
   - Store these substrings in a `HashSet` to ensure uniqueness and quick lookup.
3. **Compare**:
   - After processing the string, check if the number of unique substrings of length `k` in the `HashSet` is equal to \(2^k\).
   - If yes, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

## Code

```java
import java.util.HashSet;

public class Solution {
    public boolean hasAllCodes(String s, int k) {
        if (k > s.length()) {
            return false;
        }

        HashSet<String> uniqueSubstrings = new HashSet<>();

        for (int i = 0; i <= s.length() - k; i++) {
            String substring = s.substring(i, i + k);
            uniqueSubstrings.add(substring);
        }

        return uniqueSubstrings.size() == (1 << k); // 2^k binary codes
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.hasAllCodes("00110110", 2)); // true
        System.out.println(sol.hasAllCodes("0110", 1)); // true
        System.out.println(sol.hasAllCodes("0110", 2)); // false
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Time Complexity**: 
   - The sliding window runs in \(O(n)\), where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
   - The substring extraction and insertion into the HashSet take average \(O(1)\) time per operation.
   - Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\).

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - We store up to \(2^k\) unique substrings in the HashSet, resulting in \(O(2^k)\) space.

## Summary
This approach efficiently checks for the presence of all possible binary codes of a given length `k` as substrings within the provided string `s` using a sliding window and a HashSet. It meets the required constraints and ensures optimal performance.
