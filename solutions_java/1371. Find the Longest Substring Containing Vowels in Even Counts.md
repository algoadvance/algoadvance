[Leetcode 1371. Find the Longest Substring Containing Vowels in Even Counts](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1371)
### Problem Statement

1371. **Find the Longest Substring Containing Vowels in Even Counts**

Given the string `s`, return the size of the longest substring containing each vowel an even number of times. Vowels are `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, and `'u'`.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = "eleetminicoworoep"
Output: 13
Explanation: The longest substring is "leetminicowor" which has all vowels occurring even number of times.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = "leetcodeisgreat"
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest substring is "leetc" which has all vowels occurring even number of times.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: s = "bcbcbc"
Output: 6
Explanation: In this case, the given string contains no vowels, so the result is the length of the whole string.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are we considering uppercase vowels or only lowercase?**
   - The problem statement clearly mentions lowercase vowels only.
   
2. **What should be the return value if the string is empty?**
   - The answer would naturally be zero, as no substrings exist in an empty string.

### Strategy

1. **Bitmask Representation:** 
   - Use a bitmask to encode the even/odd status of each vowel. This compactly tracks the state of the vowels.
   - A bitmask of 5 bits: `abcde` where each bit corresponds to whether the count of `'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, `'u'` is odd (`1`) or even (`0`).

2. **Prefix HashMap:**
   - Use a HashMap to store the first occurrence of each bitmask state.
   - Initialize with bitmask `0` at position `-1` to handle even counts from the beginning.

3. **Iterate through the String:**
   - Update the bitmask as you encounter each vowel.
   - Check if the current bitmask has been seen before. If yes, calculate the potential maximum length and update the result.

### Coding

Below is the Java implementation of the strategy:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class LongestSubstringWithEvenVowels {
    public int findTheLongestSubstring(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> prefixMap = new HashMap<>();
        int bitmask = 0; // Initial state where all vowels are even (0 count).
        prefixMap.put(0, -1); // To handle the case from the very start
        int maxLength = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            char c = s.charAt(i);
            switch(c) {
                case 'a':
                    bitmask ^= (1 << 0);
                    break;
                case 'e':
                    bitmask ^= (1 << 1);
                    break;
                case 'i':
                    bitmask ^= (1 << 2);
                    break;
                case 'o':
                    bitmask ^= (1 << 3);
                    break;
                case 'u':
                    bitmask ^= (1 << 4);
                    break;
            }
            
            if (prefixMap.containsKey(bitmask)) {
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, i - prefixMap.get(bitmask));
            } else {
                prefixMap.put(bitmask, i);
            }
        }
        
        return maxLength;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the length of the string `s`. We iterate through the string once, and each operation inside the loop is O(1) (bit manipulations and hash map operations).
- **Space Complexity:** O(32) which is constant. The bitmask only has 2^5 (32) possible states, and the HashMap at most stores 32 unique entries.

This implementation balances efficiency and clarity, effectively solving the problem within optimal constraints.
