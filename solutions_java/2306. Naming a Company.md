### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 2306: Naming a Company

You are given an array of strings `ideas` that represents a list of names to be used in the process of naming a company. Your task is to calculate the number of distinct valid names for the company. 

A distinct valid name is defined by taking two names from the list, swapping their first letters, and ensuring the new names formed are not present in the original list and are not the same as the original names.

For instance, given the ideas `["coffee", "donuts"]`, you can swap the first letters to generate `["doffee", "connuts"]`, which could amount to valid names if neither `doffee` nor `connuts` are in the original list.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all the names in the list unique?**
   - Yes, the problem assumes that all names in the input list are unique.
   
2. **What is the expected length of the list and the names?**
   - The list can be large; thus, an efficient algorithm is necessary. The problem will generally require us to consider arrays with up to tens of thousands of elements.

3. **Are there any constraints on the length of individual names?**
   - Typically, the names are of reasonable length that can fit into memory, fewer than 100 characters each.

4. **Is the case of the characters significant?**
   - This problem assumes all names are in lower case.

### Strategy

1. **Group Names by Prefix**:
   - Use a map to group the names by their first letter.

2. **Evaluate Possible Swaps**:
   - Evaluate swapping pairs of prefixes. For each pair of prefixes (i.e., their corresponding sets of names), check if swapping the first letters of any two names produces valid and unique names.

3. **Efficiency**:
   - Using set operations to check for valid names quickly rather than iterating through the list multiple times to speed up the evaluation process.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class NamingCompany {
    public long distinctNames(String[] ideas) {
        Map<Character, Set<String>> prefixMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Put each name into a set based on its first letter
        for (String idea : ideas) {
            char firstChar = idea.charAt(0);
            if (!prefixMap.containsKey(firstChar)) {
                prefixMap.put(firstChar, new HashSet<>());
            }
            prefixMap.get(firstChar).add(idea.substring(1));
        }
        
        long count = 0;
        // Get all unique characters used as first letters
        Character[] uniquePrefixes = prefixMap.keySet().toArray(new Character[0]);
        
        // Compare each pair of different prefix groups
        for (int i = 0; i < uniquePrefixes.length; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j < uniquePrefixes.length; j++) {
                char charA = uniquePrefixes[i];
                char charB = uniquePrefixes[j];
                Set<String> setA = prefixMap.get(charA);
                Set<String> setB = prefixMap.get(charB);

                // Find the intersection of suffixes
                Set<String> intersection = new HashSet<>(setA);
                intersection.retainAll(setB);

                int mutualCount = intersection.size();
                int distinctFromA = setA.size() - mutualCount;
                int distinctFromB = setB.size() - mutualCount;
                
                // Each combination of distinct names produces two valid names
                count += 2L * distinctFromA * distinctFromB;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NamingCompany nc = new NamingCompany();
        String[] ideas = {"coffee", "donuts", "time", "toffee"};
        System.out.println(nc.distinctNames(ideas)); // Output expected based on input
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **O(N)** for iterating through the input array once to group the names by prefixes, where `N` is the number of names.
- **O(K^2 * M)** to compare each pair of prefix groups, where `K` is the number of unique prefixes and `M` is the average size of each prefix group.
- **O(K * F)** for calculating intersections, where `F` is the size of the largest prefix group suffix set.

Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by handling the pairwise intersections and combinations, making it highly efficient for reasonable sizes of input sets.
