[Leetcode 2610. Convert an Array Into a 2D Array With Conditions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2610)
### Problem Statement:
You are given an integer array `nums`. You need to group the numbers into a 2D array based on their value such that each sub-array contains unique numbers. The condition is each sub-array must be the longest possible.

Implement a function `findMatrix` that returns a 2D array satisfying the above condition.

**Example:**
```java
Input: nums = [1,3,4,1,2,3,1,2,3]
Output: [[1,1,1],[3,3,3],[4],[2,2]]
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can the input array be empty?
   - Yes, in that case, the function should return an empty 2D array.
2. Are the input numbers always positive integers? 
   - The problem does not specify, so we will assume they can be any integers.
3. Is the order of the elements in the resultant sub-arrays important?
   - The sub-arrays need to be grouped by value, and each sub-array should have unique values per given constraint, but the order of different sub-arrays is not specified explicitly.

### Strategy:
1. **Frequency Counting**: First, determine the frequency of each number in the given array.
2. **Bucket Sort By Frequency**: Use the frequency count to distribute numbers into sub-arrays such that each sub-array contains as many unique values as possible.
3. **Construct Resultant 2D Array**: Iterate through the frequency map and allocate numbers to sub-arrays by decrementing their count until they are exhausted.

### Steps:
1. Create a frequency map where key is the number and value is its frequency.
2. Initialize a list of lists (a 2D array) to hold the resultant sub-arrays.
3. Distribute the numbers into the sub-arrays maintaining the condition, keep adding empty sub-arrays as needed.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `nums` array, as we need to traverse the array to build the frequency map and then distribute the numbers based on their frequencies.

### Code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> findMatrix(int[] nums) {
        // Frequency map to store count of each number
        Map<Integer, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            frequencyMap.put(num, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        // 2D list to store the sub-arrays
        List<List<Integer>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // While the frequency map is not empty, add numbers to sub-arrays
        while (!frequencyMap.isEmpty()) {
            List<Integer> subArray = new ArrayList<>();
            // Temporary list to keep track of numbers to be decremented or removed from map
            List<Integer> keys = new ArrayList<>(frequencyMap.keySet());
            for (Integer key : keys) {
                subArray.add(key);
                // Decrement the count in the frequency map
                if (frequencyMap.get(key) == 1) {
                    frequencyMap.remove(key);  // remove the number from map if count becomes 0
                } else {
                    frequencyMap.put(key, frequencyMap.get(key) - 1);
                }
            }
            // Add the sub-array to the result
            result.add(subArray);
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {1, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3};
        List<List<Integer>> result = sol.findMatrix(nums);
        for (List<Integer> list : result) {
            System.out.println(list);
        }
    }
}
```

This code takes the input array `nums`, constructs a frequency map, and then iteratively constructs sub-arrays until all numbers are exhausted. Each sub-array is filled uniquely with the numbers to satisfy the given condition.
