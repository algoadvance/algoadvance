[Leetcode 225. Implement Stack using Queues](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l225)
### Problem Statement

Design and implement a stack using queues. Implement the `MyStack` class:

- `void push(int x)` Pushes element x to the top of the stack.
- `int pop()` Removes the element on the top of the stack and returns that element.
- `int top()` Returns the element on the top of the stack.
- `boolean empty()` Returns `true` if the stack is empty, `false` otherwise.

**Notes:**
- You must use only standard operations of a queue -- which means only `enqueue` to add an item to the back of the queue, `dequeue` to remove the front item of the queue, `peek`, and `empty` checks are allowed.
- You can use only one queue.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Should the implementation handle special cases like pushing to an already full stack or popping an element from an empty stack?
2. Is there a constraint on the size of the number that can be pushed?
3. Should thread-safety be considered in this implementation?

### Code

Here's the Java implementation of a stack using a single queue:

```java
import java.util.LinkedList;
import java.util.Queue;

class MyStack {

    private Queue<Integer> queue;

    public MyStack() {
        queue = new LinkedList<>();
    }

    public void push(int x) {
        int size = queue.size();
        queue.add(x);
        for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            queue.add(queue.remove());
        }
    }

    public int pop() {
        return queue.remove();
    }

    public int top() {
        return queue.peek();
    }

    public boolean empty() {
        return queue.isEmpty();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MyStack stack = new MyStack();
        stack.push(1);
        stack.push(2);
        System.out.println(stack.top());    // returns 2
        System.out.println(stack.pop());    // returns 2
        System.out.println(stack.empty());  // returns false
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Push Operation:** Add the new element to the queue and then rotate the elements in the queue such that the new element is at the front (to imitate the behavior of a stack).
   - Queue before push: [1, 2]
   - Add 3: [1, 2, 3]
   - Rotate: [3, 1, 2]

2. **Pop Operation:** Remove the front element of the queue.
3. **Top Operation:** Peek at the front element of the queue.
4. **Empty Operation:** Check if the queue is empty.

This approach ensures that the most recently added element is always at the front of the queue, mimicking the LIFO (last-in, first-out) order of a stack.

### Time Complexity

- **Push:** O(n) - Each push operation requires rotating the elements already present in the queue.
- **Pop:** O(1) - Directly removes the front element of the queue.
- **Top:** O(1) - Directly accesses the front element of the queue.
- **Empty:** O(1) - Simply checks if the queue is empty.
