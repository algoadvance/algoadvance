[Leetcode 557. Reverse Words in a String III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l557)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, you need to reverse the order of characters in each word within a sentence while still preserving whitespace and initial word order.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "Let's take LeetCode contest"
Output: "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "God Ding"
Output: "doG gniD"
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^4`
- `s` contains printable ASCII characters.
- `s` does not contain any leading or trailing spaces.
- There is at least one word in `s`.
- All the words in `s` are separated by a single space.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: Are we guaranteed that the input string will not contain multiple consecutive spaces?**
   - A: Yes.

2. **Q: Is the input string `s` mutable, or should we consider creating a new result string?**
   - A: Strings in Java are immutable, so we should consider preparing a new result string or using a mutable data structure like `StringBuilder`.

### Strategy
1. **Break Down the Problem:**
   - First, split the input string `s` by spaces to get individual words.
   - Reverse each word.
   - Join the reversed words by a space to form the final result.

2. **Steps:**
   - Split the string using `s.split(" ")`.
   - Reverse each word.
   - Use `String.join(" ", <list of reversed words>)` to combine the reversed words back into a single string.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public String reverseWords(String s) {
        // Split the input string into words
        String[] words = s.split(" ");
        
        // Reverse each word
        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            words[i] = new StringBuilder(words[i]).reverse().toString();
        }
        
        // Join the reversed words with space
        return String.join(" ", words);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        // Test cases
        System.out.println(solution.reverseWords("Let's take LeetCode contest")); // "s'teL ekat edoCteeL tsetnoc"
        System.out.println(solution.reverseWords("God Ding")); // "doG gniD"
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. This is because:
- Splitting the string into words is O(n).
- Reversing each word is O(n) in total (each character is reversed exactly once).
- Joining the words back into a string is O(n).
