[Leetcode 86. Partition List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l86)
### Problem Statement:

Given the head of a linked list and a value `x`, partition it such that all nodes less than `x` come before nodes greater than or equal to `x`.

You should preserve the original relative order of the nodes in each of the two partitions.

**Example:**
```
Input: head = 1->4->3->2->5->2, x = 3
Output: 1->2->2->4->3->5
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. What should be done if the list is empty?
   - If the list is empty, the output should also be an empty list.
   
2. Can the values of the nodes be negative?
   - Yes, the values can be negative.

3. Should we handle the input directly as a linked list, or will it be represented in some other format in the function?
   - The input will be in the form of a ListNode representing the head of the linked list.

### Strategy:

1. Create two dummy heads: one for nodes less than `x` (let's call it `less`) and one for nodes greater than or equal to `x` (`greater`).
2. Traverse the linked list. For each node, attach it to the end of the `less` list or the `greater` list based on its value.
3. After the traversal, link the end of the `less` list to the beginning of the `greater` list.
4. Return the head of the `less` list, skipping over the dummy head.

### Code:

```java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

public class Solution {
    public ListNode partition(ListNode head, int x) {
        if (head == null) return null;
        
        // Initialize two dummy heads and their respective tails
        ListNode lessHead = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode greaterHead = new ListNode(0);
        ListNode less = lessHead;
        ListNode greater = greaterHead;
        
        // Traverse the list and partition it
        while (head != null) {
            if (head.val < x) {
                less.next = head;
                less = less.next;
            } else {
                greater.next = head;
                greater = greater.next;
            }
            head = head.next;
        }
        
        // Avoid cycle in the linked list by setting the next of greater to null
        greater.next = null;
        // Connect the end of less list to the start of greater list
        less.next = greaterHead.next;
        
        return lessHead.next;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is **O(n)**, where **n** is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because we only traverse the list once.

### Space Complexity:
- The space complexity is **O(1)** since we're rearranging the nodes in place without using any additional data structure for storing nodes.
