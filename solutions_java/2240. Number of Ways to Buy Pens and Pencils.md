[Leetcode 2240. Number of Ways to Buy Pens and Pencils](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2240)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `total` indicating the total amount of money you have, and two integers `cost1` and `cost2` which denote the cost of a pen and a pencil respectively. You need to determine the number of distinct ways you can buy pens and pencils such that the total money spent does not exceed `total`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - Are the inputs guaranteed to be positive integers?
    - Can the total amount be zero?
    
    **Response**: Yes, the inputs `total`, `cost1`, and `cost2` are guaranteed to be non-negative integers. The total amount can be zero.

2. **Output Specification:**
    - What should be the output if no pens or pencils can be bought within the given budget?
    
    **Response**: The output should be 1, representing the single way of buying 0 pens and 0 pencils.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, the following approach can be taken:

1. **Iterative Approach**:
    - We iterate over the number of pens that can be bought (0 to `total//cost1`).
    - For each count of pens, calculate the remaining money and determine how many pencils can be bought with the remaining money.
    - Count all such possible combinations.

This approach ensures that we cover all possible ways to buy pens and pencils, making sure that the total cost does not exceed the given `total`.

### Code

Here's the implementation in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public long waysToBuyPensPencils(int total, int cost1, int cost2) {
        long count = 0;
        // Iterate over the number of pens
        for (int pens = 0; pens <= total / cost1; pens++) {
            // Calculate the remaining money after buying pens
            int remainingMoney = total - pens * cost1;
            // Calculate the number of pencils that can be bought with the remaining money
            count += remainingMoney / cost2 + 1;
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Time Complexity**:
   - The loop runs from 0 to `total // cost1`.
   - For each iteration, the arithmetic operations are O(1).
   - Hence, the time complexity is **O(total / cost1)**.

2. **Space Complexity**:
   - The space complexity is **O(1)** since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This solution iteratively calculates the number of ways to buy pens and pencils without exceeding the total allowed budget in an efficient manner.
