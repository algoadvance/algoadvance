[Leetcode 300. Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l300)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 2500`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the input array contain negative numbers or zero?
   **A:** Yes, as per the constraints, the range of numbers is `-10^4` to `10^4`.
   
2. **Q:** Is the sequence strictly increasing required?
   **A:** Yes, each subsequent element in the subsequence must be strictly greater than the previous one.

3. **Q:** Can we have an empty array as input?
   **A:** No, as per the constraints, the minimum length of `nums` is 1.

### Strategy
We'll use Dynamic Programming (DP) to solve this problem. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **DP Array Initialization:**
   - Initialize a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends at index `i`.
   - Initially, each element in `dp` should be 1, as the minimum length of an increasing subsequence ending at any element is 1 (the element itself).

2. **DP Array Update:**
   - For each element `nums[i]`, check all previous elements `nums[j]` where `0 <= j < i`.
   - If `nums[j] < nums[i]`, then we can extend the subsequence ending at `j` to include `nums[i]`. Hence, update `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`.

3. **Result Computation:**
   - The length of the longest increasing subsequence will be the maximum value in the `dp` array.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is `O(n^2)` where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`.
- The space complexity is `O(n)` for storing the `dp` array.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLIS(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        int maxLength = 1;
        
        // Initialize dp array
        Arrays.fill(dp, 1);
        
        // Fill dp array
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (nums[j] < nums[i]) {
                    dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
                }
            }
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, dp[i]);
        }
        
        return maxLength;
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization:**
   - We initialize a `dp` array where each element is set to 1 because the smallest increasing subsequence at any point is the element itself.

2. **DP Update:**
   - For each `nums[i]`, check all indices `j` before `i`. If `nums[j] < nums[i]`, update `dp[i]` by comparing its current value with `dp[j] + 1`.

3. **Update maxLength:**
   - Throughout each iteration, update `maxLength` to record the maximum value in the `dp` array.

4. **Return Result:**
   - Finally, return `maxLength`, which contains the length of the longest increasing subsequence.
