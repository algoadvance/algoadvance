[Leetcode 906. Super Palindromes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l906)
### Problem Statement

Given two integers represented as strings `L` and `R`, return the number of super palindromes in the inclusive range `[L, R]`.

A **super palindrome** is a number whose square is also a palindrome.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is a palindrome?**
   A palindrome is a number that reads the same forwards and backwards. 

2. **How do we define the range `[L, R]`?**
   Both `L` and `R` are strings representing integers, and any number between `L` and `R` (inclusive) is included in the range.

3. **What are the possible values for L and R?**
   The problem does not specify upper limits, so assume they are within reasonable limits to avoid performance issues (up to around \((10^{18})\) for practical purposes).

### Strategy

1. **Generate Candidate Numbers:**
   Generate candidate palindromic numbers. These candidates will be squared and then checked if the result is also a palindrome.

2. **Generate Palindromes:**
   We generate palindromes of a base number and then consider their squares. We'll need to generate palindromes efficiently by considering both odd and even digit lengths.

3. **Check Range and Palindromic Square:**
   For each generated candidate, calculate the square, and check:
   - If the square is within the range `[L, R]`.
   - If the square is a palindrome.

4. **Optimize by Limiting the Range:**
   Since `L` and `R` are large, limit the maximum base for the palindromes to the square root of `R`. We only need base pallindromes whose squares don't exceed `R`.

### Code

Here is a Java function that implements the strategy to find the number of super palindromes in the given range:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class SuperPalindromes {
    public int superpalindromesInRange(String L, String R) {
        long left = Long.parseLong(L);
        long right = Long.parseLong(R);
        Set<Long> superPalindromes = new HashSet<>();
        
        // Generate palindromes of different lengths
        for (int i = 1; i < (int)Math.pow(10, 5); i++) {
            String base = Integer.toString(i);
            
            // Generate odd length palindromes (e.g., 1, 121, 12321)
            StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder(base);
            for (int j = base.length() - 2; j >= 0; j--) {
                sb.append(base.charAt(j));
            }
            checkAndAdd(superPalindromes, sb.toString(), left, right);
            
            // Generate even length palindromes (e.g., 11, 1221, 123321)
            sb = new StringBuilder(base);
            for (int j = base.length() - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
                sb.append(base.charAt(j));
            }
            checkAndAdd(superPalindromes, sb.toString(), left, right);
        }

        return superPalindromes.size();
    }

    private void checkAndAdd(Set<Long> superPalindromes, String basePalindrome, long left, long right) {
        long number = Long.parseLong(basePalindrome);
        long square = number * number;
        if (square > right) return;
        if (square >= left && isPalindrome(Long.toString(square))) {
            superPalindromes.add(square);
        }
    }

    private boolean isPalindrome(String s) {
        int l = 0, r = s.length() - 1;
        while (l < r) {
            if (s.charAt(l++) != s.charAt(r--)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SuperPalindromes solution = new SuperPalindromes();
        int result = solution.superpalindromesInRange("4", "1000");
        System.out.println(result); // Output should match the expected result
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Palindrome Generation:** Generating palindromes can go up to \((10^5)\) candidates.
- **Square Calculation and Palindrome Check:** Both are efficient operations, checking a number and its square within the range \(L\) to \(R\).

#### Overall Complexity
The combined operations will have complexity close to \(O(N \cdot M)\) where \(N\) is the number of palindrome bases generated and \(M\) is the time to check the palindrome conditions. This ensures performance within feasible limits for the problem constraints.
