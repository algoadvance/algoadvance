[Leetcode 673. Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l673)
### Problem Statement

Given an unsorted array of integers `nums`, return the number of longest increasing subsequences.

**Example:**

- Example 1:
  - Input: `nums = [1,3,5,4,7]`
  - Output: `2`
  - Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequences are `[1, 3, 4, 7]` and `[1, 3, 5, 7]`.

- Example 2:
  - Input: `nums = [2,2,2,2,2]`
  - Output: `5`
  - Explanation: The length of the longest increasing subsequence is `1`, and there are `5` increasing subsequences of length `1`, so the answer is `5`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if the input array is empty?**
   - If `nums` is empty, the number of longest increasing subsequences is `0`.

2. **What is the range of values for the input array?**
   - The problem does not specify any range constraints; we assume typical integer values are used.

3. **Can elements in the array be negative?**
   - Yes, elements can be any integers, including negative values.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we'll use dynamic programming with the following steps:

1. **Initial Setup:**
    - Create two arrays: `lengths` and `counts`. `lengths[i]` will hold the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with `nums[i]`. `counts[i]` will hold the number of such subsequences ending at `nums[i]`.

2. **Populate the Arrays:**
    - Iterate through each element from left to right. For each element `nums[i]`, iterate through all previous elements `nums[j]` (where `j < i`). 
    - If `nums[i] > nums[j]`, it means `nums[i]` can extend the subsequence ending at `nums[j]`.
    - Depending on the length of subsequences, update `lengths[i]` and `counts[i]`.

3. **Derive the Result:**
    - Identify the maximum length from the `lengths` array.
    - Sum up all the counts corresponding to this maximum length.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int findNumberOfLIS(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 0) return 0;

        int n = nums.length;
        int[] lengths = new int[n];
        int[] counts = new int[n];

        Arrays.fill(lengths, 1);
        Arrays.fill(counts, 1);

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                    if (lengths[j] + 1 > lengths[i]) {
                        lengths[i] = lengths[j] + 1;
                        counts[i] = counts[j];
                    } else if (lengths[j] + 1 == lengths[i]) {
                        counts[i] += counts[j];
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        int maxLength = 0;
        for (int length : lengths) {
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, length);
        }

        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (lengths[i] == maxLength) {
                result += counts[i];
            }
        }

        return result;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is due to the nested loops iterating through the array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), for the `lengths` and `counts` arrays.
