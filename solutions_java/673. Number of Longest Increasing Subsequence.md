[Leetcode 673. Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence full problem statement](https://leetcode.com/problems/l673)
### Problem Statement:

Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of longest increasing subsequences.

**Example:**
```
Input: [1,3,5,4,7]
Output: 2
Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequences are [1, 3, 4, 7] and [1, 3, 5, 7].
```

**Constraints:**
- `0 <= nums.length <= 2000`
- `-10^6 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q:** Can the elements in the subsequence be non-continuous in the original array?
   **A:** Yes, the longest increasing subsequences can be non-continuous.

2. **Q:** Do we need to return the subsequences themselves or just the count?
   **A:** We only need to return the count of the longest increasing subsequences.

### Strategy:

1. Use dynamic programming to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence (LIS).
2. Maintain two arrays:
   - `lengths[i]`: The length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`.
   - `counts[i]`: The number of longest increasing subsequences ending at index `i`.
3. Loop through each element `i` in the array and for each element `j` before `i` (where `j < i`), update `lengths` and `counts` if `nums[i] > nums[j]`.
4. After processing all elements, the result should be the sum of counts where the corresponding lengths are equal to the maximum length found.

### Code:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class NumberOfLongestIncreasingSubsequence {
    public int findNumberOfLIS(int[] nums) {
        if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
        
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] lengths = new int[n]; // lengths[i] will hold the length of the LIS ending at i
        int[] counts = new int[n];  // counts[i] will hold the number of LIS ending at i
        
        Arrays.fill(counts, 1); // initially, each element is an LIS of length 1
        
        int maxLength = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                    if (lengths[j] + 1 > lengths[i]) {
                        lengths[i] = lengths[j] + 1;
                        counts[i] = counts[j];
                    } else if (lengths[j] + 1 == lengths[i]) {
                        counts[i] += counts[j];
                    }
                }
            }
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, lengths[i]);
        }
        
        int numberOfLIS = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (lengths[i] == maxLength) {
                numberOfLIS += counts[i];
            }
        }
        
        return numberOfLIS;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NumberOfLongestIncreasingSubsequence solution = new NumberOfLongestIncreasingSubsequence();
        int[] nums = {1, 3, 5, 4, 7};
        System.out.println(solution.findNumberOfLIS(nums)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- The solution involves two nested loops over all elements of the array:
  - The outer loop runs `n` times.
  - The inner loop runs up to `n-1` times.
  - Hence, the time complexity is \(O(n^2)\).

- Space Complexity:
  - We use two extra arrays, `lengths` and `counts`, each of size `n`.
  - Therefore, the space complexity is \(O(n)\).

This approach effectively calculates the length and count of all increasing subsequences and finds their maximums to provide the result.
