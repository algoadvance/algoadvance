[Leetcode 2071. Maximum Number of Tasks You Can Assign full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2071)
## Problem Statement

You have `n` employees and `m` tasks. Each task has a difficulty level represented by the array `tasks` and each employee has a strength represented by the array `workers`. The employees can perform tasks that are within their strength capability.

A task that is too difficult for a single employee can be assigned collectively to a team, meaning if `k` employees can collectively accomplish the task. You also have a restriction of making at most `p` assignments where each assignment allows exactly `k` employees to perform one task together.

Given these, you need to find the maximum number of tasks that can be assigned to employees.

You are given:
- `tasks`, an integer array with `m` elements, where `tasks[i]` is the difficulty of the i-th task.
- `workers`, an integer array with `n` elements, where `workers[j]` is the strength of the j-th employee.
- `p`, an integer representing the maximum number of assignments you can make where exactly `k` employees will perform one task together.
- `k`, an integer representing the number of employees required to collectively perform one task together.

Return the maximum number of tasks that can be assigned.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can an employee be assigned to more than one task?
   - Let's assume an employee can be reused unless specified otherwise.

2. How do combined task assignments count against worker capacity? 
   - We will assume we can reuse workers across different assignments unless limited otherwise.

3. Are `tasks` and `workers` guaranteed to be non-empty and does `p`, `k`, nâ‰¥0?
   - Yes, assume all input values will be valid according to constraints.

## Strategy

1. **Sort the lists**: First, let's sort the `tasks` array in ascending order and the `workers` array in descending order. Sorting helps in efficiently matching tasks to the weakest employees who can complete them first.
  
2. **Binary Search**: We will use a binary search to determine the maximum number of tasks that can be done within the given constraints.

3. **Greedy Approach**: Use the top `k`-strong workers for completing the most difficult task currently taken by collective assignments and use the weakest workers for simpler tasks.

4. **Validate Maximum Tasks**: Using the aforementioned greedy method, validate the number of tasks (initial tasks and combined tasks) that you can achieve.

## Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int maxTaskAssign(int[] tasks, int[] workers, int p, int k) {
        Arrays.sort(tasks);
        Arrays.sort(workers);

        int left = 0, right = tasks.length;
        
        while (left < right) {
            int mid = right - (right - left) / 2;
            if (canCompleteTasks(mid, tasks, workers, p, k)) {
                left = mid;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return left;
    }

    private boolean canCompleteTasks(int maxTasks, int[] tasks, int[] workers, int p, int k) {
        int n = workers.length;
        int m = tasks.length;
        
        if (maxTasks > m) return false;
        
        // Step 1: Check if the tasks can be done by the individual workers
        boolean[] used = new boolean[n];
        int taskIdx = maxTasks - 1;
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0 && taskIdx >= 0; i--) {
            if (workers[i] >= tasks[taskIdx]) {
                used[i] = true;
                taskIdx--;
            }
        }
        
        if (taskIdx < 0) return true;

        // Step 2: Remaining tasks require `k` workers per task
        int teamAssignments = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n && taskIdx >= 0; i++) {
            if (!used[i]) {
                int j = i + k - 1;
                if (j < n && workers[j] >= tasks[taskIdx]) {
                    taskIdx--;
                    teamAssignments++;
                    if (teamAssignments > p) return false;
                    i = j;
                } else {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return taskIdx < 0;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] tasks = {3, 2, 1};
        int[] workers = {3, 3, 3};
        int p = 1;
        int k = 3;
        System.out.println(sol.maxTaskAssign(tasks, workers, p, k)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- Sorting the `tasks` and `workers` arrays would take \(O(m \log m + n \log n)\).
- Binary search will iterate log(m) times, with each check in `canCompleteTasks` being bounded by \(O(n)\) due to iteration over workers.

Hence, the overall complexity is \(O((m + n) \log m)\).
