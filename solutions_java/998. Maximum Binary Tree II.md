[Leetcode 998. Maximum Binary Tree II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l998)
## Problem Statement

Given the root of a maximum binary tree and a value to insert into the tree, you need to insert the value into the tree such that the resulting binary tree is still a maximum binary tree.

A maximum binary tree is a tree where every node has a value greater than any other value in its subtree. You can assume there are no duplicate values in the tree.

The insertion process should follow these rules:
1. If the new value is greater than the root value, then the new value becomes the new root and the entire original tree becomes the left child of the new root.
2. Otherwise, recurse on the right subtree of the root.

Your task is to return the root of the tree after inserting the new value.

### Example
**Example 1:**
```
Input: root = [4,1,3,null,null,2], val = 5
Output: [5,4,null,1,3,null,null,2]
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [5,2,4,null,1], val = 3
Output: [5,2,4,null,1,null,3]
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: root = [5,2,3,null,1], val = 4
Output: [5,2,4,null,1,3]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the input `root` be null?
   **A:** Yes, if root is null, we simply return a new node with the inserted value.

2. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the size of the tree?
   **A:** The size of the tree should be considered within standard limits for binary tree operations. Given the problem on LeetCode, typical constraints would apply (e.g., node values are unique).

3. **Q:** How do we handle the tree if itâ€™s a single node?
   **A:** The same rule applies: If the new value is greater than the node's value, the new value becomes the new root, and the original tree becomes the left child.

## Strategy

1. If the tree is empty, create a new node with the given value and return it as the root.
2. If the value to be inserted is greater than the root node's value, create a new node with the given value. Set the current tree as the left child of this new node and return the new node as the new root.
3. Otherwise, recursively insert the value into the right subtree.
4. Continue this recursive process until the value is placed in a manner that maintains the properties of the maximum binary tree.

## Code

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }
 */
 
class Solution {
    public TreeNode insertIntoMaxTree(TreeNode root, int val) {
        if (root == null) {
            return new TreeNode(val);
        }
        
        if (val > root.val) {
            TreeNode newRoot = new TreeNode(val);
            newRoot.left = root;
            return newRoot;
        } else {
            root.right = insertIntoMaxTree(root.right, val);
            return root;
        }
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is O(h), where h is the height of the tree. In the worst case, the height of the tree could be equal to the number of nodes if the tree is skewed, resulting in O(n) time complexity for the worst case.
