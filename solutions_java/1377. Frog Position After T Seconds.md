[Leetcode 1377. Frog Position After T Seconds](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1377)
## Problem Statement:

Given an undirected tree consisting of `n` vertices numbered from `1` to `n`. A frog starts jumping from vertex `1`. On each second, the frog jumps to another vertex that is adjacent to its current vertex. The frog makes jumps until it reaches the target vertex `target` or it can no longer jump (i.e., it has reached a leaf). When the frog reaches a leaf, it stops moving. When the frog reaches the target vertex, it stops and will not jump anymore. 

The tree is given in an undirected tree format as `edges`, where `edges[i] = [a, b]` denotes that there is an edge between the vertices `a` and `b`.

The probability that after exactly `t` seconds the frog is on the vertex `target` is to be calculated. Return 0 if the frog cannot be on the `target` vertex after `t` seconds.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. Are the vertices guaranteed to form a single undirected tree with no cycles?
   
   Yes, the input is always guaranteed to form a valid tree structure (single connected component with no cycles).

2. What should we return if the frog can never reach the `target` vertex in exactly `t` seconds?

   If the frog can never reach the `target` vertex in exactly `t` seconds, the output should be `0`.

3. If the frog is already at the `target` after `t` seconds but doesn't have any subsequent jump options (leaf node), should we count that as a valid case?

   Yes, if the frog is at the `target` vertex after `t` seconds and it does not have any further positions to jump to (or it is already a leaf), it is considered valid.

## Strategy:

1. **Graph Representation:** Represent the tree using an adjacency list.
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Perform a BFS starting from vertex `1` to simulate the frog's movements and calculate probabilities.
3. **Probability Tracking:** Keep track of the probability of being at each vertex using an array.
4. **Time Tracking:** Maintain the time spent to determine if the frog has reached the target node within the given time `t`.

### Steps:

1. **Initialize:** Create an adjacency list for the graph. Initialize a queue for BFS that starts with node `1`.
2. **BFS Traversal:** Perform BFS, updating the probability of reaching each node. If a node is reached, calculate the probability of reaching its neighbors.
3. **Leaf Checking:** Ensure to check if a node is a leaf (excluding the initial node) while calculating probabilities.

## Code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class FrogPositionAfterTSeconds {
    public double frogPosition(int n, int[][] edges, int t, int target) {
        // Adjacency list representation
        List<Integer>[] graph = new ArrayList[n + 1];
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            graph[edge[0]].add(edge[1]);
            graph[edge[1]].add(edge[0]);
        }
        
        // BFS setup
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        double[] probability = new double[n + 1];
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n + 1];
        
        // Starting from node 1
        queue.offer(1);
        probability[1] = 1.0;
        visited[1] = true;
        
        int currentTime = 0;

        // Perform BFS
        while (!queue.isEmpty() && currentTime < t) {
            int size = queue.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                int currentNode = queue.poll();
                int unvisitedChildren = 0;

                // Count unvisited child nodes
                for (int neighbor : graph[currentNode]) {
                    if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                        unvisitedChildren++;
                    }
                }

                // Update probabilities for unvisited children
                for (int neighbor : graph[currentNode]) {
                    if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                        visited[neighbor] = true;
                        queue.offer(neighbor);
                        probability[neighbor] = probability[currentNode] / unvisitedChildren;
                    }
                }

                // If there are unvisited children, set the probability of staying still to 0
                if (unvisitedChildren > 0) {
                    probability[currentNode] = 0;
                }
            }

            currentTime++;
        }

        // Resulting probability
        return probability[target];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        FrogPositionAfterTSeconds solution = new FrogPositionAfterTSeconds();
        int[][] edges = // use example above
        int n = 3;
        int t = 1;
        int target = 2;
        System.out.println(solution.frogPosition(n, edges, t, target)); // Output: 1.0
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:

- **Graph Representation:** O(n)
- **BFS Traversal:** O(n)

Overall time complexity is O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree.
