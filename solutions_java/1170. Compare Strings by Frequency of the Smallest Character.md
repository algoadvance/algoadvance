[Leetcode 1170. Compare Strings by Frequency of the Smallest Character](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1170)
### Problem Statement

Given two string arrays `queries` and `words`, return an integer array `answer`, where each `answer[i]` is the number of words such that the frequency of the smallest character in `queries[i]` is less than the frequency of the smallest character in every word in `words`.

**Example:**
```
Input: queries = ["cbd"], words = ["zaaaz"]
Output: [1]
Explanation: The frequency of the smallest character in queries is [3], while the frequency of the smallest character in words is [3]. Since no value in queries is less than any in words, the output is [0].
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= queries.length, words.length <= 2000`
- `1 <= queries[i].length, words[i].length <= 10`
- `queries[i][j]`, `words[i][j]` are English lowercase letters.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Is there any constraint on the characters present in `queries` and `words` (e.g., only lowercase letters)?
   - **Answer:** Yes, all characters in `queries` and `words` are English lowercase letters.
   
2. Do we need to account for empty strings in `queries` or `words`?
   - **Answer:** No, based on the problem constraints, `queries[i]` and `words[i]` will have lengths between 1 and 10, so they cannot be empty.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently:
1. **Frequency Calculation Function:** Implement a function `getSmallestCharFrequency` to calculate the frequency of the smallest character in a given string.
2. **Compute Frequencies:** Precompute the frequencies of the smallest character for all strings in `words`.
3. **Sort and Binary Search:** Sort the computed frequencies of `words`. For each query, use binary search to count how many of these frequencies are greater than the frequency of the smallest character in that query.

### Code
Here's the implementation of the above strategy in Java:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class CompareStringsFrequency {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String[] queries = {"cbd"};
        String[] words = {"zaaaz"};
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(numSmallerByFrequency(queries, words)));
    }

    public static int[] numSmallerByFrequency(String[] queries, String[] words) {
        int[] wordFrequencies = new int[words.length];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
            wordFrequencies[i] = getSmallestCharFrequency(words[i]);
        }
        
        Arrays.sort(wordFrequencies);
        
        int[] result = new int[queries.length];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < queries.length; i++) {
            int queryFrequency = getSmallestCharFrequency(queries[i]);
            result[i] = binarySearchGreaterFrequency(wordFrequencies, queryFrequency);
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    private static int getSmallestCharFrequency(String s) {
        char smallestChar = 'z';
        int frequency = 0;
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c < smallestChar) {
                smallestChar = c;
                frequency = 1;
            } else if (c == smallestChar) {
                frequency++;
            }
        }
        
        return frequency;
    }

    private static int binarySearchGreaterFrequency(int[] sortedFrequencies, int target) {
        int low = 0, high = sortedFrequencies.length;
        
        while (low < high) {
            int mid = (low + high) / 2;
            if (sortedFrequencies[mid] <= target) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid;
            }
        }
        
        return sortedFrequencies.length - low;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Precomputation:** Calculating the frequency for each word and query is \(O(N \times L + M \times L)\), where \(N\) and \(M\) are the lengths of `queries` and `words` respectively, and \(L\) is the maximum length of the strings.
- **Sorting:** Sorting the frequencies of `words` array is \(O(M \log M)\).
- **Query Processing:** For each query, we perform a binary search in \(O(\log M)\). Thus, this step's total complexity is \(O(N \log M)\).

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(N \times L + M \times L + M \log M + N \log M)\). Given the problem constraints, this approach should be efficient.
