[Leetcode 2841. Maximum Sum of Almost Unique Subarray](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2841)
### Problem Statement

**Maximum Sum of Almost Unique Subarray**

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `m`. Return the maximum sum of any subarray whose length is at most `m` and contains at most `m - 1` distinct elements.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range and length of the input array `nums`?**
   - This can help tailor the solution to manage potential edge cases.
   
2. **Can the input array contain negative integers?**
   - This could impact the strategy for finding the maximum subarray sum.
   
3. **Is the subarray required to have a minimum length?**
   - It's not explicitly stated, but we assume the length can range from 1 to `m`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach combined with a hash map (or dictionary) to track the number of distinct elements in the current window.

#### Steps:

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - A hash map to count the frequency of elements in the current window.
   - Two pointers to mark the start and end of the sliding window.
   - A variable to track the current sum of the elements in the window.
   - A variable to track the maximum sum found.

2. **Sliding Window Technique:**
   - Expand the window by moving the end pointer and update the element counts and current sum.
   - If the window contains more than `m - 1` distinct elements or its length exceeds `m`, move the start pointer to shrink the window until the conditions are satisfied.
   - Update the maximum sum if the current window meets the conditions.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `m` is 1, any subarray will contain at most 0 unique elements which means only one element subarrays are considered.
   - Arrays with all identical elements.

### Code

Here's the implementation in Java:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class MaximumSumAlmostUniqueSubarray {
    public int maxSumAlmostUniqueSubarray(int[] nums, int m) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int maxSum = 0;
        int currentSum = 0;
        Map<Integer, Integer> countMap = new HashMap<>();
        int start = 0;

        for (int end = 0; end < n; end++) {
            countMap.put(nums[end], countMap.getOrDefault(nums[end], 0) + 1);
            currentSum += nums[end];
            
            // Check if we need to shrink the window
            while (countMap.size() >= m || end - start + 1 > m) {
                countMap.put(nums[start], countMap.get(nums[start]) - 1);
                if (countMap.get(nums[start]) == 0) {
                    countMap.remove(nums[start]);
                }
                currentSum -= nums[start];
                start++;
            }
            
            // Update maxSum if the current conditions are met
            if (end - start + 1 <= m && countMap.size() <= m - 1) {
                maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);
            }
        }

        return maxSum;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximumSumAlmostUniqueSubarray solution = new MaximumSumAlmostUniqueSubarray();
        int[] nums = {4, 4, 4, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6}; // Sample input
        int m = 3; // Sample input
        System.out.println(solution.maxSumAlmostUniqueSubarray(nums, m)); // Expected output: 15
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n). Each element is processed at most twice (once added to the window and once removed).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n). In the worst case, the hash map can contain all distinct elements of the array if `m` equals the array length.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the required maximum sum using sliding window and hash map techniques.
