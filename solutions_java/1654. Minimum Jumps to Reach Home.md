[Leetcode 1654. Minimum Jumps to Reach Home](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1654)
### Problem Statement

You are given integers `forbidden`, `a`, `b`, and `x`. A red frog starts at home (position 0) and must get to position `x`. The frog can jump forward with a distance equal to `a` (i.e. from position `i` to position `i + a`), or it can jump backward with a distance equal to `b` (i.e. from position `i` to position `i - b`). However, it cannot jump to any of the forbidden positions given in the `forbidden` array.

Write a function to find the minimum number of jumps needed for the frog to reach position `x`. If there is no way for the frog to reach position `x`, return `-1`.


### Clarifying Questions
1. **What constraints do the input values have?**
   - `forbidden.length <= 2000`
   - `1 <= a, b, x <= 2000`
   - All positions in `forbidden` are distinct and within the range `[0, 2000]`.

2. **Can the frog jump to the negative positions?**
   - No, the frog cannot move to negative positions.

3. **What is the initial status regarding backward jumps?**
   - The frog starts at position 0 and can move both forward and backward based on the given distances.

With this info, let's proceed to the strategy and the code.

### Strategy
This problem can be solved using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. BFS is particularly suitable for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph, which in this case represents different positions on a number line.

1. **Set up a BFS queue** where each element is a triplet (current_position, jump_count, has_backward_jumped).
2. **Use a Set to track visited positions** to prevent revisiting and infinite loops.
3. **Initialize the queue** with the starting position.
4. **Enqueue valid forward and backward jumps** and mark them as visited.
5. **If the frog reaches position `x`, return the number of jumps taken**.
6. **If the queue is exhausted without reaching `x`, return `-1`.**

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MinimumJumpsToReachHome {
    public int minJumps(int[] forbidden, int a, int b, int x) {
        Set<Integer> forbiddenSet = new HashSet<>();
        for (int pos : forbidden) {
            forbiddenSet.add(pos);
        }

        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        Set<String> visited = new HashSet<>();

        queue.offer(new int[]{0, 0, 0}); // {position, jumps, last moved backward}
        visited.add("0:0"); // position:backwardFlag

        int maxPos = 2000 + a + b;
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int[] current = queue.poll();
            int position = current[0];
            int jumps = current[1];
            int backStep = current[2];

            if (position == x) return jumps;

            // Forward jump
            int forwardPos = position + a;
            String forwardKey = forwardPos + ":0";
            if (forwardPos <= maxPos && !forbiddenSet.contains(forwardPos) && !visited.contains(forwardKey)) {
                queue.offer(new int[]{forwardPos, jumps + 1, 0});
                visited.add(forwardKey);
            }

            // Backward jump
            int backwardPos = position - b;
            String backwardKey = backwardPos + ":1";
            if (backStep == 0 && backwardPos >= 0 && !forbiddenSet.contains(backwardPos) && !visited.contains(backwardKey)) {
                queue.offer(new int[]{backwardPos, jumps + 1, 1});
                visited.add(backwardKey);
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this BFS approach is O(max_position) where `max_position` is a combination of `a`, `b`, and `x`. In our problem constraints, it is `O(2000 + a + b)` which ensures it stays manageable. The space complexity is also equivalent due to the use of a queue and set to track visited states. 

This code is designed to quickly find the minimum number of jumps needed to reach the target position while respecting the constraints and forbidden positions.
