[Leetcode 996. Number of Squareful Arrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l996)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers, you have to determine the number of permutations that form a squareful array. A "squareful" array is an array where the sum of every pair of adjacent elements is a perfect square.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Array length constraints:** What is the range of lengths that the array can have?
   - **Answer:** The array length can be up to 12.
   
2. **Element constraints:** What are the possible values for the elements in the array?
   - **Answer:** The elements can be any integers.

3. **Output:** Should we consider the order of permutations? For example, is `[1, 17, 8]` different from `[8, 17, 1]`?
   - **Answer:** Yes, all unique permutations should be counted separately.

4. **Duplicates in the array:** Can the array contain duplicate elements?
   - **Answer:** Yes, the array can contain duplicate elements.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use backtracking to generate all possible permutations of the given array and check each permutation to see if it is squareful. However, to optimize this approach, we will use a few strategies:

1. **Precompute Perfect Squares:** We can precompute squares up to the sum of the largest possible pairs of elements to quickly verify if a sum is a perfect square.
2. **Use a Frequency Counter:** Since the array can contain duplicates, we'll utilize a frequency counter to ensure that each permutation remains valid.
3. **Backtracking with Early Termination:** During backtracking, terminate early if a sum of a pair is not a perfect square.

### Code

Here is the Java code implementing the above strategy:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    
    public int numSquarefulPerms(int[] nums) {
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        List<List<Integer>> results = new ArrayList<>();
        backtrack(nums, new boolean[nums.length], new ArrayList<>(), results);
        return results.size();
    }
    
    private void backtrack(int[] nums, boolean[] used, List<Integer> current, List<List<Integer>> results) {
        if (current.size() == nums.length) {
            results.add(new ArrayList<>(current));
            return;
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
            if (used[i]) continue;
            if (i > 0 && nums[i] == nums[i - 1] && !used[i - 1]) continue;
            
            if (current.size() > 0 && !isPerfectSquare(current.get(current.size() - 1) + nums[i])) {
                continue;
            }
            
            used[i] = true;
            current.add(nums[i]);
            backtrack(nums, used, current, results);
            used[i] = false;
            current.remove(current.size() - 1);
        }
    }
    
    private boolean isPerfectSquare(int num) {
        int sqrt = (int) Math.sqrt(num);
        return sqrt * sqrt == num;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.numSquarefulPerms(new int[]{1, 17, 8})); // Output: 2
        System.out.println(sol.numSquarefulPerms(new int[]{2, 2, 2}));  // Output: 1
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution involves several factors:
1. **Permutation Generation:** Generating all permutations of an array of length `n` involves `n!` permutations.
2. **Checking Perfect Squares:** For each permutation, checking sums involves `O(n)` comparisons.
3. **Backtracking Pruning:** Prunning based on perfect square checks can significantly reduce the number of permutations explored.

Therefore, the worst-case time complexity is `O(n! * n)`, but the actual running time will be much less due to the pruning condition. 

The space complexity is `O(n)` due to the recursion stack and the storage of the current permutation during backtracking.
