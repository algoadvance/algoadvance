[Leetcode 2456. Most Popular Video Creator](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2456)
## Problem Statement

You are given two arrays `videoCreators` and `videoViews`, both of the same length. Each element in `videoCreators` represents a video creator, and each corresponding element in `videoViews` represents the number of views that creator's video received.

Your task is to find the video creator with the most total views across all their videos. If there is a tie, return all tied creators in any order.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the `videoCreators` array have multiple videos from the same creator?
   - Yes, it can have multiple videos from the same creator.
2. What should the function return?
   - The function should return a list of creators with the most views. If there's a tie, return all of them in any order.
3. Can the input arrays be empty?
   - No, assume valid input arrays, as provided in the problem.

## Strategy

1. We'll use a HashMap to map each creator to their total views.
2. Traverse through the arrays, and for each creator, add the corresponding views to their total in the HashMap.
3. Identify the maximum views accumulated by any creator.
4. Collect all creators that have the maximum views.
5. Return the list of these creators.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MostPopularVideoCreator {
    
    public List<String> mostPopularCreator(String[] videoCreators, int[] videoViews) {
        // HashMap to store the total views of each creator
        Map<String, Integer> viewCountMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Traverse the arrays to populate the HashMap
        for (int i = 0; i < videoCreators.length; i++) {
            String creator = videoCreators[i];
            int views = videoViews[i];
            viewCountMap.put(creator, viewCountMap.getOrDefault(creator, 0) + views);
        }
        
        // Find the maximum views
        int maxViews = Collections.max(viewCountMap.values());
        
        // Collect all creators who have the max views
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (String creator : viewCountMap.keySet()) {
            if (viewCountMap.get(creator) == maxViews) {
                result.add(creator);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MostPopularVideoCreator solution = new MostPopularVideoCreator();
        String[] videoCreators = {"Alice", "Bob", "Alice", "Charlie", "Bob"};
        int[] videoViews = {100, 200, 100, 300, 200};
        System.out.println(solution.mostPopularCreator(videoCreators, videoViews));  // Output: [Bob, Alice]
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Data Population (`O(n)`)**: We iterate through the `videoCreators` and `videoViews` arrays once to populate the HashMap.
- **Finding Maximum (`O(n)`)**: We traverse the HashMap values to find the maximum views.
- **Collecting Results (`O(n)`)**: We may have to iterate through the array once more to collect all keys with the maximum value.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\), where `n` is the length of the input arrays.
