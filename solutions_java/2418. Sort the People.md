[Leetcode 2418. Sort the People full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2418)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `names`, where each `names[i]` is the name of the i-th person. You are also given an array `heights`, where each `heights[i]` is the height of the i-th person.

Return `names` sorted in descending order by the people's heights.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the relationship between `names` and `heights`?**
   - Each element in `names` corresponds to the person at the same index in `heights`.

2. **Can the names or heights be duplicated?**
   - Names can be duplicated, but heights should be unique as per the problem description.

3. **Are there any constraints on the size of the arrays?**
   - The problem does not explicitly state constraints, but typically LeetCode problems have reasonable constraints such as the arrays not exceeding 10^4 elements.

4. **What should we return if both arrays are empty or have different lengths?**
   - If the arrays are empty or have different lengths, it's likely out of scope for a well-defined problem. However, normal prerequisites should ensure they are non-empty and have the same length.

### Strategy

1. **Combine Names and Heights:** Create pairs or tuples of names and corresponding heights.
2. **Sort the Combined List:** Sort these pairs based on the heights in descending order.
3. **Extract Sorted Names:** Extract the names from the sorted list of pairs.

### Code

Here is a Java implementation of the solution strategy:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class SortPeopleByHeight {
    public String[] sortPeople(String[] names, int[] heights) {
        int n = names.length;
        List<Pair> peopleList = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            peopleList.add(new Pair(heights[i], names[i]));
        }
        
        // Sort the list by heights in descending order
        peopleList.sort((a, b) -> b.height - a.height);
        
        String[] sortedNames = new String[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            sortedNames[i] = peopleList.get(i).name;
        }
        
        return sortedNames;
    }
    
    class Pair {
        int height;
        String name;
        
        Pair(int height, String name) {
            this.height = height;
            this.name = name;
        }
    }
    
    // Example usage:
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SortPeopleByHeight sorter = new SortPeopleByHeight();
        String[] names = {"Mary", "John", "Emma"};
        int[] heights = {180, 165, 170};
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(sorter.sortPeople(names, heights)));  // Output: [Mary, Emma, John]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Combining Names and Heights:** This takes O(n) time where n is the length of the input array.
- **Sorting the List:** Sorting the list takes O(n log n) time.
- **Extracting Sorted Names:** Extracting names from the sorted list takes O(n) time.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is **O(n log n)**.
