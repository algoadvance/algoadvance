[Leetcode 920. Number of Music Playlists](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l920)
### Problem Statement
You are given `N` different songs and you are asked to create a playlist of `L` songs, with the constraints that at least `K` songs must be between any two repeats of the same song. The objective is to determine the number of possible playlists.

Specifically:
- `N` is the total number of different songs.
- `L` is the total number of songs in the playlist.
- `K` is the minimum number of songs that must be between repeats of the same song.

Return the number of possible playlists. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the songs distinct?
    - Yes, the songs are distinct.
2. Can songs be repeated in the playlist?
    - Yes, but there must be at least `K` other songs between repeats of the same song.
3. Is order important in the playlist?
    - Yes, the order is important.

### Strategy
We will use dynamic programming (DP) to solve this problem.

Define `dp[i][j]` to be the number of playlists of length `i` that include exactly `j` different songs.

Base cases:
- `dp[0][0] = 1`: There is one way to create a playlist of length 0 with 0 songs, which is an empty playlist.
- For all other `dp[0][j]` and `dp[i][0]` where `i > 0` or `j > 0`, the values are zero because you can't use 0 songs to make a non-empty playlist or make a non-zero used songs playlist of length 0.

Transition:
- If you add a new song that hasnâ€™t been used before, you can pick any of the `N - j` remaining songs. Then, the count could be `dp[i-1][j-1] * (N - j + 1)`.
- If you use an existing song (which requires at least `K` gap with its previous occurrence), there are `j` choices, leading to `dp[i-1][j] * (j - K)` if `j > K`.

### Code

```java
public class NumberOfMusicPlaylists {
    static final int MOD = 1000000007;

    public int numMusicPlaylists(int N, int L, int K) {
        long[][] dp = new long[L + 1][N + 1];

        dp[0][0] = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i <= L; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= N; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] * (N - j + 1) % MOD;
                if (j > K) {
                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i - 1][j] * (j - K)) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }

        return (int) dp[L][N];
    }

    // Main for Testing
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NumberOfMusicPlaylists solution = new NumberOfMusicPlaylists();
        System.out.println(solution.numMusicPlaylists(3, 3, 1)); // Expected: 6
        System.out.println(solution.numMusicPlaylists(2, 3, 0)); // Expected: 6
        System.out.println(solution.numMusicPlaylists(2, 3, 1)); // Expected: 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is `O(L * N)`, as it iterates over all playlist lengths `L` and all unique songs `N` to fill the DP table.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is `O(L * N)` to store the DP table.

This solution will handle large inputs efficiently within the constraints provided.
