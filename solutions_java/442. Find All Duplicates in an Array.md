[Leetcode 442. Find All Duplicates in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l442)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` of length `n` where all the integers of `nums` are in the range `[1, n]` and each integer appears once or twice, you need to find all the integers that appear twice.

You should implement an algorithm that runs in `O(n)` time and uses `O(1)` extra space (excluding the input and output).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be the return type of the function?**
   - The function should return a list of integers that appear twice in the array.

2. **Can the input array be modified?**
   - Yes, we can modify the input array to achieve the desired space complexity.

3. **Are there any duplicate numbers allowed in the output list?**
   - No, each duplicate number should appear only once in the output list.

### Strategy

To satisfy the `O(n)` time complexity and `O(1)` extra space complexity, we can use the array indices to track visited numbers:

1. Iterate through the array `nums`.
2. For each element `nums[i]`, use its absolute value `val = abs(nums[i])` to find the index `val - 1`.
3. If `nums[val-1]` is positive, it indicates that the number `val` has not been visited yet, so negate `nums[val-1]` to mark it as visited.
4. If `nums[val-1]` is already negative, it means the number `val` has been encountered before, and hence it is a duplicate.
5. Collect all the duplicates and return them as a list.

This method ensures we only traverse the array once (`O(n)`) and use the array itself to keep track of visited elements, achieving `O(1)` extra space complexity.

### Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        List<Integer> duplicates = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int val = Math.abs(nums[i]);
            if (nums[val - 1] < 0) {
                duplicates.add(val);
            } else {
                nums[val - 1] = -nums[val - 1];
            }
        }
        
        return duplicates;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`. We iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, excluding the space used for the output list since we are directly modifying the input array to achieve the solution.

This approach efficiently finds all the duplicates with the given constraints.
