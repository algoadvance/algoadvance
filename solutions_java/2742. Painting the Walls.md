[Leetcode 2742. Painting the Walls](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2742)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `costs` where `costs[i]` is the cost of painting the ith wall, and an integer array `time` where `time[i]` is the time it takes to paint the ith wall.

To paint the walls in a sequence:

- You can only start painting a wall if you have finished painting all previous walls.
- You can paint the ith wall in $time[i]$ units of time.

Return the total time it takes to paint all the walls.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we start painting multiple walls at the same time?**
   - No, we need to paint the walls sequentially, finishing each wall before starting the next one.

2. **What is the constraint on the number of walls (length of the array)?**
   - Let's assume the length can be up to $10^6$.

3. **Are the costs and time units positive integers?**
   - Yes, all elements in `costs` and `time` are positive integers.

### Strategy

Since we're given costs and time arrays but only need to calculate the total painting time, we can ignore the costs array. We need to accumulate the total time required by summing the time array.

### Code

```java
public class PaintingWalls {
    public static int totalPaintingTime(int[] costs, int[] time) {
        int totalTime = 0;
        for (int t : time) {
            totalTime += t;
        }
        return totalTime;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] costs = {5, 10, 15};
        int[] time = {4, 2, 7};
        System.out.println(totalPaintingTime(costs, time)); // should print 13
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- We initialize `totalTime` to 0.
- Then, we iterate over the `time` array, adding each value to `totalTime`.
- Finally, we return `totalTime`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: $O(n)$ where $n$ is the number of walls.
  - This stems from a single loop over the `time` array.
- **Space Complexity**: $O(1)$.
  - We only use a constant amount of extra space (the `totalTime` variable).

This solution efficiently computes the total time required to paint all walls sequentially.
