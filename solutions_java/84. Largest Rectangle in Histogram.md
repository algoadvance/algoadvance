[Leetcode 84. Largest Rectangle in Histogram](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l84)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `heights` representing the histogram's bar height where the width of each bar is `1`, return the area of the largest rectangle in the histogram.

Example:
```
Input: heights = [2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3]
Output: 10
Explanation: The largest rectangle has an area = 10 units.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: What is the range of heights for each bar? Are there any constraints on the size of the array?
2. **Output**: Should the function return just the area of the largest rectangle?
3. **Edge Cases**: What should the function return if the input array is empty?

### Strategy
1. **Using a Stack**:
   - We can use a stack to keep track of the indices of the bars.
   - We traverse the `heights` array.
   - For each bar, if the current bar is higher than the bar at the stack's top, we push its index onto the stack.
   - If the current bar is lower, we pop the stack and calculate the area of the rectangle with the popped bar as the smallest (or minimum height) bar. We calculate the area by considering the width as the difference between the current index and the index stored at the new top of the stack after popping.
   - Continue the above step until the stack is empty or until the top of the bar on the stack is less than or equal to the current bar.
   - After we have processed all bars, we need to ensure we handle the remaining bars in the stack in a similar way.

### Code
Here is the Java solution utilizing the above strategy:

```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class LargestRectangleInHistogram {
    public int largestRectangleArea(int[] heights) {
        if (heights == null || heights.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        int maxArea = 0;
        int index = 0;
        
        while (index < heights.length) {
            // If this bar is higher than the bar at stack top, push it to the stack
            if (stack.isEmpty() || heights[index] >= heights[stack.peek()]) {
                stack.push(index++);
            } else {
                // Calculate the area for the bar at the top of the stack
                int top = stack.pop();
                // If stack is empty, the width is the current index because all bars
                // to the left are higher than or equal to the current bar
                int width = stack.isEmpty() ? index : index - stack.peek() - 1;
                maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, heights[top] * width);
            }
        }
        
        // Now, pop remaining bars in stack and calculate area for them
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            int top = stack.pop();
            int width = stack.isEmpty() ? index : index - stack.peek() - 1;
            maxArea = Math.max(maxArea, heights[top] * width);
        }
        
        return maxArea;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LargestRectangleInHistogram solver = new LargestRectangleInHistogram();
        int[] heights = {2, 1, 5, 6, 2, 3};
        System.out.println(solver.largestRectangleArea(heights));  // Output: 10
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of bars in the histogram. Each bar is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for the extra space used by the stack to store indices.
