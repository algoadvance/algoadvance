[Leetcode 372. Super Pow](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l372)
## Problem Statement
In this problem, you are given two positive integers `a` and an array of positive integers `b` which represents a very large integer. You need to calculate the result of `a^b` modulo `1337`.

Specifically, you are to implement a function `superPow`, which is defined as follows:
```java
public int superPow(int a, int[] b)
```
The result should be `a` raised to the power represented by the array `b` modulo `1337`.

### Examples
1. Input: `a = 2`, `b = [3]`
    Output: `8`
2. Input: `a = 2`, `b = [1,0]`
    Output: `1024`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: What is the range of values for `a` and the elements of `b`?**\
   A: `a` is a positive integer up to `2^31 - 1`. Elements of `b` range from `0` to `9`.
   
2. **Q: How large can the array `b` be?**\
   A: `b` can have up to `200` elements.
   
3. **Q: Can `a` or `b` have any leading zeros in the array?**\
   A: No, `a` will not have leading zeros and `b` will not have leading elements in the array.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to use modular exponentiation to manage the large powers efficiently. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step plan:
1. **Modular exponentiation()**: Since `a` and `b` can be very large, we can use properties of modular arithmetic to simplify the computation.
2. **Decompose the array `b`**: Break down `b` into smaller parts and compute the corresponding powers of `a` modulo `1337`.
3. **Combining the results**: Use the property `(a^m * a^n) % k = ( (a^m % k) * (a^n % k) ) % k`.

Specifically, we can recursively reduce the problem using:
- `a^b % k = (a^(b/n*n + b%n)) % k = ((a^b/n * a^b%n) % k)`

We will use a helper function to manage the recursive breakdown of the problem and use the modulus properties effectively.

## Code
```java
public class Solution {
    private static final int MOD = 1337;

    public int superPow(int a, int[] b) {
        return superPowHelper(a, b, b.length - 1);
    }

    private int superPowHelper(int a, int[] b, int idx) {
        if (idx == -1) {
            return 1;
        }
        int lastDigit = b[idx];
        
        int part1 = myPow(a, lastDigit);
        int part2 = myPow(superPowHelper(a, b, idx - 1), 10);
        
        return part1 * part2 % MOD;
    }

    private int myPow(int a, int k) {
        a %= MOD;
        int result = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            result = result * a % MOD;
        }
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.superPow(2, new int[]{3}));          // Output: 8
        System.out.println(sol.superPow(2, new int[]{1, 0}));       // Output: 1024
        System.out.println(sol.superPow(2, new int[]{1, 0, 2, 4})); // Output might vary but you can predict as needed.
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The recursive breakdown happens in O(d) where `d` is the number of digits in `b`. For each digit, the power calculation is at most 10 multiplications (since the maximum digit value is 9). Therefore, the time complexity is approximately O(d * 10), which can be simplified as O(d).
- **Space Complexity**: The recursion depth can go up to O(d), and additional space complexity is constant for operations.

This ensures the solution is efficient given the constraints.
