[Leetcode 786. K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l786)
### Problem Statement

Given a sorted array of integers `arr` containing `1` and prime numbers, you need to find the `k`-th smallest fraction in the form `arr[i]/arr[j]` where `0 <= i < j < arr.length`. Return the fraction in the form of an array of two integers `[arr[i], arr[j]]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of values in `arr`:** What are the possible values or size ranges for `arr`? 
   - Generally, the size can be from 1 to 1000 and values can range from 1 to 10⁻⁴.

2. **Value of `k`:** Is `k` always valid, i.e., does `k` always fall within the range of possible fractions?
   - Yes, the value for `k` will always be valid as per the constraints.

3. **Duplicates:** Can `arr` contain duplicate numbers?
   - According to the problem, `arr` contains only `1` and distinct prime numbers.

4. **Output Format:** Should the fractions be returned in any specific form?
   - Yes, return the fractions in the form of an array `[arr[i], arr[j]]`.

### Strategy

1. **Heap Approach:**
   - Use a min-heap (priority queue) to keep track of the k-th smallest fractions.
   - Since the array is already sorted in ascending order, the smallest fractions will be those involving smaller indices initially.
   
2. **Binary Search Approach:**
   - Binary search can be used to find the k-th smallest fraction by searching over possible values between the smallest (`arr[0]/arr[arr.length-1]`) and the largest fraction (`arr[arr.length-2]/arr[arr.length-1]`).
   - The process involves checking the number of fractions that are less than or equal to the middle fraction (in terms of value).

### Chosen Approach: Binary Search (due to better efficiency)

1. **Initialize Left (`low`) and Right (`high`):** Initialize the search range for fractions.
2. **Counting Fractions Less Than Mid:** Create a helper function to count and possibly track the fractions less than a given value.
3. **Binary Search Loop:** Adjust `low` and `high` based on the count.
4. **Find Exact Fraction:** Keep searching fractions within these bounds until the k-th fraction is found.

### Code

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class Solution {
    public int[] kthSmallestPrimeFraction(int[] arr, int k) {
        double low = 0.0, high = 1.0;
        
        while (low < high) {
            double mid = (low + high) / 2.0;
            int[] result = countFractions(arr, mid);
            
            if (result[2] < k) {
                low = mid;
            } else {
                high = mid;
            }
            
            if (Math.abs(low - high) < 1e-9) {
                return new int[] {arr[result[0]], arr[result[1]]};
            }
        }
        
        return new int[] {};  // Should never be reached.
    }

    private int[] countFractions(int[] arr, double mid) {
        int count = 0;
        int n = arr.length;
        int x = 0, y = n - 1;
        
        int best_i = 0, best_j = 0;
        double best_fraction = 0.0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            while (y >= 0 && (double) arr[i] / arr[y] > mid) {
                y--;
            }
            if (y >= 0) {
                count += y + 1;
                if ((double) arr[i] / arr[y] > best_fraction) {
                    best_i = i;
                    best_j = y;
                    best_fraction = (double) arr[i] / arr[y];
                }
            }
        }
        
        return new int[] {best_i, best_j, count};
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search Complexity:** The outer loop runs `O(log(1/epsilon))`, where `epsilon` is the precision level.
- **Counting Fractions Complexity:** Each pass through the array is linear `O(n)`.
- **Overall Complexity:** The complexity is `O(n log(1/epsilon))`, where `n` is the size of the input array. Given practical limits, this is efficient.

This solution efficiently finds the k-th smallest prime fraction using a combination of binary search and counting methodology.
