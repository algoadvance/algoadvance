[Leetcode 2919. Minimum Increment Operations to Make Array Beautiful](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2919)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of integers, implement a function `minIncrementOperations` that returns the minimum number of operations required to make the array beautiful. An array is considered beautiful if for every `i` (1 ≤ i < n) `nums[i] ≠ nums[i-1]`. In one operation, you can increment an element of the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the maximum size of the array `nums`? 
    - Can the array contain negative numbers?
    - Are there any restrictions on the range of elements within the array?

   **Assumption (based on common LeetCode constraints)**:
    - The maximum size of the array `nums` could be reasonably assumed to be within `10^5`.
    - The array can contain negative numbers.
    - There is no restriction on the range of elements.

2. **Output Specifications**:
   - Is there any specific format for the output, or should it just return the minimum number of operations as an integer?

   **Assumption**:
   - The function should return a single integer representing the minimum number of operations.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to ensure that no two consecutive elements in the array are equal by incrementing the necessary elements with minimum operations.

Steps:
1. Traverse the array `nums` from the second element onwards.
2. Check if the current element is equal to the previous element. 
3. If they are equal, increment the current element in such a way that it becomes different from the previous element and count these operations.
4. Continue this process until the end of the array is reached.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minIncrementOperations(int[] nums) {
        int operations = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] <= nums[i - 1]) {
                int increment = nums[i - 1] - nums[i] + 1;
                nums[i] += increment;
                operations += increment;
            }
        }
        
        return operations;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums1 = {1, 2, 2};
        System.out.println(sol.minIncrementOperations(nums1));  // Output: 1

        int[] nums2 = {3, 3, 3, 3};
        System.out.println(sol.minIncrementOperations(nums2));  // Output: 3

        int[] nums3 = {1, 5, 5, 3};
        System.out.println(sol.minIncrementOperations(nums3));  // Output: 3
        
        int[] nums4 = {1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1};
        System.out.println(sol.minIncrementOperations(nums4));  // Output: 6
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the number of elements in the array. This is because we only make a single pass through the array.
- The space complexity is **O(1)** since we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
