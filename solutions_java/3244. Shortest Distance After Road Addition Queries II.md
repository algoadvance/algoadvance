[Leetcode 3244. Shortest Distance After Road Addition Queries II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3244)
### Problem Statement

Given a simple connected undirected graph with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n-1` and `m` edges (initial state), implementing the following operations:

1. `shortestPath` (u, v): Returns the shortest distance between nodes `u` and `v` in the current graph.
2. `addEdge` (a, b, d): Adds a new edge between nodes `a` and `b` with distance `d` to the current graph.

Initially, the graph can be assumed to be in its initial state without any added edges. The shortestPath queries should reflect the current state of the graph with any added edges included.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can nodes in the graph have additional properties or are they just labeled with indices?**
    - They are just labeled with indices from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Are the weights of the edges initially in the graph all positive?**
    - Yes, all edge weights are positive.

3. **What is the typical size of `n` and `m`?**
    - Let's assume `n` can be up to 1000 and `m` can be up to 2000.

4. **Should the solutions prioritize pre-processing or on-the-fly computation during queries?**
    - Ideally, the solution should balance both, but fast query responses are often prioritized in such problems.

### Strategy

To solve this problem effectively, we need a data structure that supports dynamic changes to the graph (adding edges) and also allows efficient shortest path queries. One viable approach is to use the following:
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: To compute the all-pairs shortest path initially.
- **Dynamic Updates**: Update the distance matrix whenever an edge is added.

#### Steps

1. **Preprocess the initial graph** using the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to find all-pairs shortest paths.
2. **Handle shortestPath queries** by directly looking up the precomputed distance in the matrix.
3. **Handle addEdge operations** by:
   - Adding the edge to the graph.
   - Updating the shortest path matrix for the newly added edge using dynamic programming.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class GraphShortestPath {
    private int[][] dist;
    private int n;

    public GraphShortestPath(int n, int[][] edges) {
        this.n = n;
        this.dist = new int[n][n];

        // Initialize distances
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            Arrays.fill(dist[i], Integer.MAX_VALUE);
            dist[i][i] = 0;
        }

        // Set initial edges
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0], v = edge[1], w = edge[2];
            dist[u][v] = w;
            dist[v][u] = w;
        }

        // Floyd-Warshall Algorithm to find all pairs shortest paths
        for (int k = 0; k < n; k++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                    if (dist[i][k] != Integer.MAX_VALUE && dist[k][j] != Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
                        dist[i][j] = Math.min(dist[i][j], dist[i][k] + dist[k][j]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    public int shortestPath(int u, int v) {
        return dist[u][v];
    }

    public void addEdge(int a, int b, int d) {
        // Update the distance matrix dynamically
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (dist[i][a] != Integer.MAX_VALUE && dist[b][j] != Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
                    dist[i][j] = Math.min(dist[i][j], dist[i][a] + d + dist[b][j]);
                }
                if (dist[i][b] != Integer.MAX_VALUE && dist[a][j] != Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
                    dist[i][j] = Math.min(dist[i][j], dist[i][b] + d + dist[a][j]);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int n = 4;
        int[][] edges = {
            {0, 1, 5},
            {1, 2, 3},
            {2, 3, 1},
            {3, 0, 10}
        };
        GraphShortestPath gsp = new GraphShortestPath(n, edges);
        System.out.println("Shortest Path (0 -> 2): " + gsp.shortestPath(0, 2)); // Expected: 8
        gsp.addEdge(1, 3, 2);
        System.out.println("Shortest Path (0 -> 2) after adding (1,3) with distance 2: " + gsp.shortestPath(0, 2)); // Expected: 7
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Floyd-Warshall Initialization**: `O(n^3)`
- **Query for shortestPath(u, v)**: `O(1)`
- **addEdge(a, b, d)**: `O(n^2)`

This approach ensures that the shortest path queries are efficient (`O(1)`), but it allows for dynamic updates with an acceptable complexity `O(n^2)`.
