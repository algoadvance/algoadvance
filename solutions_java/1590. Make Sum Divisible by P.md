[Leetcode 1590. Make Sum Divisible by P](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1590)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of positive integers `nums`, remove the minimum number of elements from `nums` such that the sum of the remaining elements is divisible by `p`. It is guaranteed that a solution always exists.

Return the length of the smallest subarray that you need to remove, or -1 if it's impossible.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for `nums` and `p`?**
   - `nums` consists of integers in the range `[1, 10^9]`.
   - `p` is also in the range `[1, 10^9]`.

2. **What are the limits on the size of `nums`?**
   - The length of `nums` could be up to `10^5`.

3. **Is there always at least one solution?**
   - Yes, it's guaranteed that a solution always exists.

### Strategy

1. **Calculate the total sum of the array `nums`.**
2. **Find the remainder when this sum is divided by `p`.** Let's call this `rem`. For the sum to be divisible by `p`, `rem` must be zero.
3. **If `rem` is zero**, the sum is already divisible by `p` and the minimum length to remove is 0.
4. **If `rem` is non-zero**, find the smallest subarray whose sum gives the remainder `rem` when taken modulo `p`.
5. **Use prefix sums combined with a hashmap** to efficiently track and find the required subarray.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public int minSubarray(int[] nums, int p) {
        int totalSum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            totalSum += num;
            totalSum %= p;
        }

        if (totalSum % p == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        int targetRemainder = totalSum % p;
        int currentPrefixSum = 0;
        int minLength = nums.length;
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> prefixSumMap = new HashMap<>();
        prefixSumMap.put(0, -1); // For full subarray scenarios

        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            currentPrefixSum += nums[i];
            currentPrefixSum %= p;

            int neededPrefix = (currentPrefixSum - targetRemainder + p) % p;
            if (prefixSumMap.containsKey(neededPrefix)) {
                minLength = Math.min(minLength, i - prefixSumMap.get(neededPrefix));
            }

            prefixSumMap.put(currentPrefixSum, i);
        }

        return minLength == nums.length ? -1 : minLength;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {3,1,4,2};
        int p = 6;
        System.out.println(sol.minSubarray(nums, p)); // Expected: 1
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **O(n)**: where `n` is the length of `nums`. 
  - We iterate through the array to compute the total sum.
  - Another iteration through the array to find the minimal subarray using prefix sums and hash map.

- **Space Complexity**
  - **O(n)** in the worst case for the hash map to store prefix sums.
