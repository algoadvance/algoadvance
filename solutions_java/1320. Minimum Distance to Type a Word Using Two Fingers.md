[Leetcode 1320. Minimum Distance to Type a Word Using Two Fingers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1320)
### Problem Statement

You have a keyboard layout that consists of `26` lowercase English letters arranged in the following grid:

```
[a b c d e]
[f g h i j]
[k l m n o]
[p q r s t]
[u v w x y]
[z]
```

To type a word, you can move from one letter to another by using two fingers. The distance between two letters `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` on the keyboard is defined as the Manhattan distance, which is `|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|`.

Initially, both fingers are on the first letter of the word. Return the minimum total distance required to type the given word.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Distance Calculation**: Should we consider the initial distance for the first letter?
   - No, the fingers initially being on the first letter means no distance needs to be computed for the first letter.

2. **Moving Both Fingers**: Are we allowed to move both fingers simultaneously?
   - While we can use both fingers to minimize the distance, only one finger can be used to type a letter at a time.

3. **Single or Two Finger Usage**: Should we always use two fingers, or is it allowable to sometimes use just one?
   - You can use one or both fingers, as long as the total distance is minimized.

### Strategy

The problem is optimal for a dynamic programming (DP) approach due to its overlapping subproblems and optimal structure properties. 

#### Dynamic Programming (DP) Definition:
Define `dp[i][j][k]` to be the minimum distance to type the first `k` letters of the word, where `i` is the index of the character the first finger is on, and `j` is the index of the character the second finger is on.

#### Key Steps:
1. Initialize a DP array with dimensions reflecting the positions of both fingers and the length of the word.
2. Start with initial positions set to the first character of the word.
3. Iterate through the word, computing distances based on whether the first or second finger types the current character.
4. Track the minimum cumulative distances for all possible positions of the two fingers through iterations.
5. Finally, aggregate the minimum distance values to find the optimal solution.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MinimumDistanceToTypeWord {
    public int minimumDistance(String word) {
        int n = word.length();
        
        // If the word length is 1, no movement is needed
        if (n == 1) return 0;
        
        // Initialize dp array
        int[][] dp = new int[26][26];
        for (int[] arr : dp) {
            Arrays.fill(arr, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        }
        
        // Initial position is on the first character of the word
        int firstChar = word.charAt(0) - 'A';
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            dp[firstChar][i] = 0;
            dp[i][firstChar] = 0;
        }
        
        // Helper function to map a char to its grid coordinates
        int[] coords = new int[2];
        for (int k = 1; k < n; k++) {
            int currChar = word.charAt(k) - 'A';
            for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                if (dp[i][currChar] < Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
                    coords = getCoord(currChar);
                    dp[i][currChar] = Math.min(dp[i][currChar], dp[i][firstChar] + distance(i, currChar));
                }
                if (dp[currChar][i] < Integer.MAX_VALUE) {
                    coords = getCoord(i);
                    dp[currChar][i] = Math.min(dp[currChar][i], dp[firstChar][i] + distance(currChar, i));
                }
            }
            firstChar = currChar;
        }
        
        int minDistance = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            minDistance = Math.min(minDistance, dp[firstChar][i]);
            minDistance = Math.min(minDistance, dp[i][firstChar]);
        }
        
        return minDistance;
    }
    
    // Manhattan distance calculation
    private int distance(int from, int to) {
        int[] fromCoord = getCoord(from);
        int[] toCoord = getCoord(to);
        return Math.abs(fromCoord[0] - toCoord[0]) + Math.abs(fromCoord[1] - toCoord[1]);
    }
    
    // Function to map the index of a character to its coordinates on the keyboard
    private int[] getCoord(int index) {
        int[][] coordMap = {
            {0, 0}, {0, 1}, {0, 2}, {0, 3}, {0, 4},
            {1, 0}, {1, 1}, {1, 2}, {1, 3}, {1, 4},
            {2, 0}, {2, 1}, {2, 2}, {2, 3}, {2, 4},
            {3, 0}, {3, 1}, {3, 2}, {3, 3}, {3, 4},
            {4, 0}, {4, 1}, {4, 2}, {4, 3}, {4, 4},
            {5, 0}
        };
        return coordMap[index];
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumDistanceToTypeWord solution = new MinimumDistanceToTypeWord();
        System.out.println(solution.minimumDistance("CAKE")); // Expected output: 3
        System.out.println(solution.minimumDistance("HAPPY")); // Expected output: 6
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity can be approximated as follows:
- Preprocessing and initial setup: \(O(1)\) since it's constant time operations.
- Dynamic programming updates and nested looping through the length `n` of the word and `26` possible characters.

The worst-case time complexity is \(O(n \cdot 26^2)\). Considering the word represents linear traversal and character keyboard has a fixed size, this can be handled efficiently within the limits of typical input cases.
