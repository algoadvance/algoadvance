[Leetcode 51. N](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l51)
### Problem Statement

The N-Queens problem is a classic backtracking problem where you need to place N queens on an NÃ—N chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other. This means that no two queens may share the same row, column, or diagonal.

Your task is to find all distinct solutions to the N-Queens puzzle. Each solution contains a distinct board configuration of the N queens' placement, where 'Q' and '.' both indicate a queen and an empty space, respectively.

### Example

```
Input: n = 4
Output: [
 [".Q..",  // Solution 1
  "...Q",
  "Q...",
  "..Q."],

 ["..Q.",  // Solution 2
  "Q...",
  "...Q",
  ".Q.."]
]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the value of `n`? (e.g., `n` will always be greater than or equal to 1).
2. **Output Format**: Should the solutions be given exactly as `List<List<String>>`?

### Strategy

1. **Backtracking Approach**:
   - Use a backtracking algorithm to explore all potential placements of queens on the board.
   - Check the validity of each placement by ensuring no two queens threaten each other.
  
2. **Optimization Techniques**:
   - Use arrays (or hash sets) to keep track of columns, diagonals, and anti-diagonals that are already occupied by a queen to ensure valid placements.

### Code Implementation

The following Java code demonstrates how to solve the N-Queens problem using the backtracking approach:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Set;

public class NQueens {
    
    public List<List<String>> solveNQueens(int n) {
        List<List<String>> solutions = new ArrayList<>();
        char[][] board = new char[n][n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                board[i][j] = '.';
            }
        }
        
        Set<Integer> columns = new HashSet<>();
        Set<Integer> diagonals = new HashSet<>();
        Set<Integer> antiDiagonals = new HashSet<>();
        
        backtrack(solutions, board, 0, columns, diagonals, antiDiagonals, n);
        return solutions;
    }
    
    private void backtrack(List<List<String>> solutions, char[][] board, int row,
                           Set<Integer> columns, Set<Integer> diagonals, Set<Integer> antiDiagonals, int n) {
        if (row == n) {
            solutions.add(construct(board));
            return;
        }
        
        for (int col = 0; col < n; col++) {
            int currentDiagonal = row - col;
            int currentAntiDiagonal = row + col;
            
            // If the current column or diagonals are already occupied by a queen, skip this position
            if (columns.contains(col) || diagonals.contains(currentDiagonal) || antiDiagonals.contains(currentAntiDiagonal)) {
                continue;
            }
            
            // Place the queen
            board[row][col] = 'Q';
            columns.add(col);
            diagonals.add(currentDiagonal);
            antiDiagonals.add(currentAntiDiagonal);
            
            // Proceed to place the next queen
            backtrack(solutions, board, row + 1, columns, diagonals, antiDiagonals, n);
            
            // Remove the queen and backtrack
            board[row][col] = '.';
            columns.remove(col);
            diagonals.remove(currentDiagonal);
            antiDiagonals.remove(currentAntiDiagonal);
        }
    }
    
    private List<String> construct(char[][] board) {
        List<String> solution = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
            solution.add(new String(board[i]));
        }
        return solution;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NQueens nQueens = new NQueens();
        List<List<String>> solutions = nQueens.solveNQueens(4);
        for (List<String> solution : solutions) {
            for (String row : solution) {
                System.out.println(row);
            }
            System.out.println();
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the backtracking solution is generally O(N!), where N is the size of the board. This is because for each queen placement, you eliminate one row and potentially reduce the number of valid columns, diagonals, and anti-diagonals. However, due to the constraints on combinations, the actual runtime could be less in practice but still grows very rapidly with larger values of N.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(N^2) due to the storage of the board array and the additional sets to track the columns, diagonals, and anti-diagonals.
