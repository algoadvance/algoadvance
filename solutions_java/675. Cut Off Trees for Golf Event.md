[Leetcode 675. Cut Off Trees for Golf Event full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l675)
## Problem Statement

You are asked to cut off trees in a forest for a golf event. The forest is represented as a 2D grid of integers, where:

- `0` represents obstacles.
- `1` represents flat ground you can walk on.
- An integer greater than `1` represents a tree with a height equal to the value of the integer.

You are tasked to cut off all the trees in ascending order of their heights, starting from the top-left corner of the forest. Once you cut off a tree, the cell becomes flat ground (`1`).

You can only move up, down, left, and right from your current position. You must find the minimum steps needed to cut all trees or return `-1` if it's not possible to cut all the trees.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the starting position have a tree?**
   - Yes, and you would need to cut it if it's the smallest tree.

2. **How large can the grid be?**
   - The problem doesn't specify, but typically these grids are manageable in size (e.g., less than 100x100).

3. **Is the grid always guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, you will always have a grid to work with.

## Strategy

1. **Identify all Trees**: Extract all tree positions and their heights and store them sorted by height.
2. **BFS for Minimum Steps**: Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to find the shortest path between consecutive trees. This ensures shortest paths due to BFS properties.
3. **Calculate Total Steps**: Starting from the (0,0) position, cut the trees in the order of their heights, summing up the minimum steps. If any tree is unreachable, return `-1`.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    // Class to represent a point in the grid
    class Point {
        int x, y;
        Point(int x, int y) {
            this.x = x;
            this.y = y;
        }
    }

    public int cutOffTree(List<List<Integer>> forest) {
        // List to store all the trees with their heights and positions
        List<int[]> trees = new ArrayList<>();
        int rows = forest.size();
        int cols = forest.get(0).size();

        // Collect all trees in the forest with their heights and positions
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                int height = forest.get(i).get(j);
                if (height > 1) {
                    trees.add(new int[]{height, i, j});
                }
            }
        }

        // Sort the trees by their height
        Collections.sort(trees, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]));

        // Starting coordinates
        int startX = 0, startY = 0;
        int totalSteps = 0;

        // BFS directions
        int[][] directions = new int[][]{{0,1}, {1,0}, {0,-1}, {-1,0}};

        // Function to perform BFS and return minimum steps from (sx, sy) to (tx, ty)
        int bfs(List<List<Integer>> forest, int sx, int sy, int tx, int ty) {
            Queue<Point> queue = new LinkedList<>();
            boolean[][] visited = new boolean[rows][cols];
            queue.add(new Point(sx, sy));
            visited[sx][sy] = true;
            int steps = 0;

            while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
                int size = queue.size();
                for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                    Point point = queue.poll();
                    int x = point.x;
                    int y = point.y;

                    if (x == tx && y == ty) {
                        return steps;
                    }

                    for (int[] dir : directions) {
                        int nx = x + dir[0];
                        int ny = y + dir[1];
                        if (nx >= 0 && nx < rows && ny >= 0 && ny < cols && !visited[nx][ny] && forest.get(nx).get(ny) != 0) {
                            queue.add(new Point(nx, ny));
                            visited[nx][ny] = true;
                        }
                    }
                }
                steps++;
            }
            
            return -1; // If the target is not reachable
        }

        // Traverse the trees in sorted order and sum up the steps
        for (int[] tree : trees) {
            int steps = bfs(forest, startX, startY, tree[1], tree[2]);
            if (steps == -1) {
                return -1;
            }
            totalSteps += steps;
            startX = tree[1];
            startY = tree[2];
        }

        return totalSteps;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting Trees**: \(O(T \log T)\), where \(T\) is the number of trees.
- **BFS Traversal**: In the worst case, BFS will visit each cell once, so it is \(O(R \times C)\), where \(R\) is the number of rows and \(C\) is the number of columns. This will be executed \(T\) times in the worst case.

Thus, the overall time complexity will be \(O(T \log T + T \times R \times C)\).

Considering the constraints mentioned, this solution should be efficient enough for typical input sizes seen in such problems.
