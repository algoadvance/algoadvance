[Leetcode 127. Word Ladder](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l127)
### Problem Statement

You are given two words, `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`. Write a function to find the length of the shortest transformation sequence from `beginWord` to `endWord`, such that:

1. Only one letter can be changed at a time.
2. Each transformed word must exist in the word list.

Return the length of the sequence. If no such sequence exists, return 0.

**Note:**

- `beginWord` does not count as a transformed word.
- All words have the same length.
- All words contain only lowercase alphabetical characters.
- You may assume no duplicates in `wordList`.
- You may assume `beginWord` and `endWord` are non-empty and are not the same.

### Constraints

- `1 <= beginWord.length <= 10`
- `1 <= wordList.length <= 5000`
- `wordList[i].length == beginWord.length`
- `beginWord`, `endWord`, and `wordList[i]` comprise of lowercase English letters.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can `endWord` be different than any word in the `wordList`?
   - Yes, `endWord` may not be in `wordList`, and in such cases, we return 0.

2. Is there any consideration for case-sensitivity?
   - No, the description clearly states that all words contain only lowercase alphabetical characters.

3. If `beginWord` equals `endWord`, should we return 0 or the length of the transformation where no changes are made?
   - Since the transformation requires at least one change and `beginWord != endWord`, return 0 for no valid transformation sequence.

### Strategy

We'll use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to solve this problem. BFS is ideal for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph structure, which is perfect for this type of traversal.

Here's the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Initial Checks**: 
   - If `endWord` is not in the `wordList`, return `0`.
   
2. **Data Structures**:
   - Use a queue to perform BFS.
   - Use a set to efficiently check if a word exists in the `wordList`.

3. **Process**:
   - Initialize the queue with the `beginWord` and the transformation length as `1`.
   - For the current word, generate all possible transformations by changing one letter at a time.
   - If a transformation matches the `endWord`, return the current transformation length + 1.
   - Otherwise, if the transformed word is in the `wordList`, enqueue it and mark it as visited.

4. **Termination**:
   - If the queue is exhausted and no transformation leads to `endWord`, return `0`.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class WordLadder {
    public int ladderLength(String beginWord, String endWord, List<String> wordList) {
        Set<String> wordSet = new HashSet<>(wordList);
        if (!wordSet.contains(endWord)) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        Queue<Pair<String, Integer>> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.add(new Pair<>(beginWord, 1));

        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            Pair<String, Integer> node = queue.poll();
            String word = node.getKey();
            int steps = node.getValue();
            
            if (word.equals(endWord)) {
                return steps;
            }
            
            for (int i = 0; i < word.length(); i++) {
                char[] wordArray = word.toCharArray();
                for (char ch = 'a'; ch <= 'z'; ch++) {
                    wordArray[i] = ch;
                    String newWord = new String(wordArray);
                    if (wordSet.contains(newWord)) {
                        queue.add(new Pair<>(newWord, steps + 1));
                        wordSet.remove(newWord);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return 0;
    }
    
    private class Pair<K, V> {
        private final K key;
        private final V value;
        
        public Pair(K key, V value) {
            this.key = key;
            this.value = value;
        }
        
        public K getKey() {
            return key;
        }
        
        public V getValue() {
            return value;
        }
   }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The primary components affecting time complexity are:

1. **Word Generation**: For each word of length `L`, we generate `26L` possible transformations.
2. **Queue Processing**: Each word is processed once, and there's a maximum of `N` words.

Thus, the time complexity roughly sums to `O(N * 26L)`, which simplifies to `O(NL)` where N is the number of words in the `wordList` and L is the length of each word.

### Summary

This BFS approach ensures we find the shortest transformation sequence by exploring all possible transformations level by level. The use of a set ensures that each word is only processed once, leading to efficient performance.
