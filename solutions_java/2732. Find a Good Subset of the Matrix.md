[Leetcode 2732. Find a Good Subset of the Matrix full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2732)
## Problem Statement:

Given a binary matrix (a matrix consisting of only 0s and 1s), find a subset of rows from the matrix such that, when considered together, they form a matrix that has the same number of 1s in each column.

For instance, if the matrix is:
```
1 0 1
0 1 1
1 1 0
```
A subset of rows (indices) such that the resultant matrix has the same number of 1s in each column must be identified.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Matrix Constraints:** 
    - What is the maximum size of the matrix?
    - Can we have an empty subset as the result?
    - Should the subset contain unique rows only, or can it include duplicate rows?
    - Is there always a guaranteed solution?

2. **Output Requirements:**
    - Should the function return the indices of the rows forming the subset or the actual subset matrix?
    - If multiple subsets meet the criteria, should any specific subset be preferred?

## Strategy:

1. **Understand the Problem:**
    - We need to find a subset of rows such that each column of the subset matrix has identical counts of 1s.

2. **Approach:**
    - Check all combinations of rows in the matrix and find the valid subsets.
    - A column in the result matrix should maintain uniform 1s count irrespective of row permutations.

3. **Implementation Steps:**
    - Iterate through possible combinations of rows.
    - For each combination, check if it satisfies the requirement.
    - Return the first valid combination found.

4. **Edge Cases:**
    - Matrices with all zeros or all ones.
    - Subsets consisting of only individual rows, having same number of ones.

## Code:

Here's a sample implementation in Java:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findGoodSubset(int[][] matrix) {
        int rows = matrix.length;
        int cols = matrix[0].length;

        // Iterate through all possible non-empty subsets of rows
        for (int i = 1; i < (1 << rows); i++) {
            List<Integer> subset = new ArrayList<>();
            for (int j = 0; j < rows; j++) {
                if ((i & (1 << j)) != 0) {
                    subset.add(j);
                }
            }
            if (isValidSubset(matrix, subset, cols)) {
                return subset;
            }
        }
        return new ArrayList<>();  // Return empty list if no valid subset is found
    }

    private boolean isValidSubset(int[][] matrix, List<Integer> subset, int cols) {
        int[] colCount = new int[cols];

        for (int rowIndex : subset) {
            for (int c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
                if (matrix[rowIndex][c] == 1) {
                    colCount[c]++;
                }
            }
        }

        // Check if all columns have the same number of 1s
        int requiredCount = colCount[0];
        for (int c : colCount) {
            if (c != requiredCount) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    // To test the implementation
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[][] matrix = {
            {1, 0, 1},
            {0, 1, 1},
            {1, 1, 0}
        };
        List<Integer> result = sol.findGoodSubset(matrix);
        System.out.println(result);  // Output: [0, 1] or similar valid subsets
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** The worst-case time complexity of this solution would be \(O(2^n \cdot n \cdot m)\), where \(n\) is the number of rows and \(m\) is the number of columns. This is because we are enumerating all possible subsets of rows, and for each subset, we are checking the validity in \(O(n \cdot m)\) time.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is \(O(n)\) for storing subsets.

This code iterates through all possible non-empty subsets of rows to identify a valid subset that satisfies the given conditions and returns the indices of the rows forming that subset.
