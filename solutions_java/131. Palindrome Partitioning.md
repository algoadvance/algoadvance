[Leetcode 131. Palindrome Partitioning](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l131)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, partition `s` such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. Return all possible palindrome partitioning of `s`.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: s = "aab"
Output: [["a","a","b"],["aa","b"]]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length of the string `s`?**
   - This will help us understand the constraints and expected time complexity.
2. **Are there any constraints on the characters in the string?**
   - Usually, strings are composed of lowercase English letters.
3. **Should the partitions contain all possible palindromes, including single characters?**
   - By the problem statement, yes, all characters and possible palindromes should be included.

### Strategy

1. **Backtracking Approach:**
   - We will use a backtracking approach to explore all possible partitions.
   - For each position in the string, we will check if the substring up to that point is a palindrome.
   - If it is, we will recurse with the remaining part of the string.
   - We will use a helper function to check if a given substring is a palindrome.

2. **Helper Function `isPalindrome`:**
   - This function will take a substring and return whether it is a palindrome.

3. **Backtracking Function `backtrack`:**
   - This will recursively partition the string and store valid partitions if the substring is a palindrome.

4. **Base Case:**
   - If we reach the end of the string, we add the current partition to the result list.

### Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public List<List<String>> partition(String s) {
        List<List<String>> result = new ArrayList<>();
        backtrack(s, 0, new ArrayList<>(), result);
        return result;
    }

    private void backtrack(String s, int start, List<String> currentList, List<List<String>> result) {
        if (start == s.length()) {
            result.add(new ArrayList<>(currentList));
            return;
        }
        
        for (int end = start + 1; end <= s.length(); end++) {
            if (isPalindrome(s, start, end - 1)) {
                currentList.add(s.substring(start, end));
                backtrack(s, end, currentList, result);
                currentList.remove(currentList.size() - 1);
            }
        }
    }

    private boolean isPalindrome(String s, int low, int high) {
        while (low < high) {
            if (s.charAt(low++) != s.charAt(high--)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        String s = "aab";
        List<List<String>> result = sol.partition(s);
        System.out.println(result);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Backtracking Complexity:** The time complexity is quite high due to the exponential number of partitions; each character has a decision to either start a new partition or continue with the previous one.
  - If there are `n` characters, there are `2^(n-1)` ways to partition `n` characters.

- **Palindrome Check Complexity:** Checking each substring if it's a palindrome takes `O(n)` time.

- **Total Complexity:** In the worst case, for each possible partition, we are checking if the substring is a palindrome. If `n` is the length of the string:
  - Total time complexity is approximately `O(n * 2^n)`.

While this approach can handle small strings effectively, it might not scale well for very large strings due to the exponential nature of the problem.
