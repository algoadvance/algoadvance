[Leetcode 1704. Determine if String Halves Are Alike](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1704)
### Problem Statement:
This problem is from LeetCode and is labeled "1704. Determine if String Halves Are Alike." The problem statement is as follows:

You are given a string `s` of even length. Split this string into two halves of equal lengths. The first half is `a` and the second half is `b`. Two strings `a` and `b` are alike if they have the same number of vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u', 'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U'). Note that a vowel is the same in uppercase and lowercase.

Return `true` if `a` and `b` are alike. Otherwise, return `false`.

#### Example 1:
- Input: `s = "book"`
- Output: `true`
- Explanation: `a = "bo"` and `b = "ok"`. `a` has 1 vowel, and `b` has 1 vowel. Therefore, they are alike.

#### Example 2:
- Input: `s = "textbook"`
- Output: `false`
- Explanation: `a = "text"` and `b = "book"`. `a` has 1 vowel, but `b` has 2. Therefore, they are not alike.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Is the length of string `s` guaranteed to be even?**
   - Yes, per the problem statement.
2. **Are we considering only vowels as defined by the problem (a, e, i, o, u in both cases)?**
   - Yes, only those characters.

### Strategy:
1. Split the string `s` into two halves: `a` and `b`.
2. Define a helper function to count the number of vowels in a given substring.
3. Compare the number of vowels in both halves and return `true` if they are the same, else return `false`.

### Code:
```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class DetermineStringHalvesAlike {
    // Set containing vowels for quick lookup
    private static final Set<Character> VOWELS = new HashSet<>();
    
    static {
        VOWELS.add('a'); VOWELS.add('e'); VOWELS.add('i'); VOWELS.add('o'); VOWELS.add('u');
        VOWELS.add('A'); VOWELS.add('E'); VOWELS.add('I'); VOWELS.add('O'); VOWELS.add('U');
    }

    public boolean halvesAreAlike(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        int mid = n / 2;
        
        int firstHalfVowelCount = countVowels(s, 0, mid);
        int secondHalfVowelCount = countVowels(s, mid, n);
        
        return firstHalfVowelCount == secondHalfVowelCount;
    }

    private int countVowels(String s, int start, int end) {
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = start; i < end; i++) {
            if (VOWELS.contains(s.charAt(i))) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DetermineStringHalvesAlike solution = new DetermineStringHalvesAlike();

        // Example 1
        System.out.println(solution.halvesAreAlike("book"));  // Output: true

        // Example 2
        System.out.println(solution.halvesAreAlike("textbook"));  // Output: false
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **O(n)**: The string is traversed twice, once to split into halves and then to count vowels, making it linear in time complexity with respect to the length of the string `s`.

This approach ensures efficient and clear comparison between the two halves of the string to determine if they are alike based on the count of vowels.
