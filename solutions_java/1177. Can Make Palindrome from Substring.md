[Leetcode 1177. Can Make Palindrome from Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1177)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` and array `queries` where each query contains three integers `[left, right, k]`. For each query, you need to determine if it's possible to make the substring `s[left:right + 1]` a palindrome by changing at most `k` characters. Return a list of booleans where the i-th boolean denotes the answer to the i-th query.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length range of string `s` and the number of queries?**
   - The length of `s` can be up to \(10^5\), and the number of queries can also be up to \(10^5\).

2. **What characters does the string `s` contain?**
   - The string `s` consists of lowercase English letters only.

3. **Can the indices in the queries go out of the bounds of the string `s`?**
   - No, the indices `left` and `right` are guaranteed to be valid, i.e., \(0 \leq left \leq right < \text{length of } s\).

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently:
1. **Precompute Character Frequencies:** Maintain a prefix sum array for character frequencies. Let's call this `prefixFreq`, where `prefixFreq[i][c]` represents the number of times character `c` appears in the substring `s[0:i+1]`.
2. **Query Handling:** For each query, compute the character frequencies in the substring `s[left:right+1]` using the prefix frequencies.
3. **Determine Palindrome Transformation:** To form a palindrome, at most one character can have an odd frequency (for odd length substring) and every other character must have an even frequency. The number of changes required will be determined by the sum of half of the characters with odd occurrences.

### Solution Code

Here's the code that applies the above strategy:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class CanMakePalindromeFromSubstring {

    public List<Boolean> canMakePaliQueries(String s, int[][] queries) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[][] prefixFreq = new int[n + 1][26];

        // Build the prefix frequency array
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int ch = s.charAt(i) - 'a';
            for (int j = 0; j < 26; j++) {
                prefixFreq[i + 1][j] = prefixFreq[i][j];
            }
            prefixFreq[i + 1][ch]++;
        }

        List<Boolean> result = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int[] query : queries) {
            int left = query[0];
            int right = query[1];
            int k = query[2];

            int oddCount = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < 26; j++) {
                int freq = prefixFreq[right + 1][j] - prefixFreq[left][j];
                if (freq % 2 != 0) {
                    oddCount++;
                }
            }

            result.add(oddCount / 2 <= k);
        }
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        CanMakePalindromeFromSubstring sol = new CanMakePalindromeFromSubstring();
        String s = "abcda";
        int[][] queries = // use example above
        System.out.println(sol.canMakePaliQueries(s, queries));
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing (Prefix Frequency Array):** \(O(26 \times n)\), which simplifies to \(O(n)\) since 26 is a constant.
- **Query Handling:** Each query is processed in \(O(26)\), which simplifies to \(O(1)\) per query because 26 is a constant.
- **Total Time Complexity:** \(O(n + q \times 1) = O(n + q)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string \(s\) and \(q\) is the number of queries.

This approach ensures that both the preprocessing and each query operation are efficient, making it suitable for large inputs as described in the problem statement.
