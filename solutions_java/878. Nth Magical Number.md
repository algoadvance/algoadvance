[Leetcode 878. Nth Magical Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l878)
### Problem Statement:

Given two positive integers `a` and `b`, return the nth magical number. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

A number is considered magical if it is divisible by either `a` or `b`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What are the constraints on `n`, `a`, and `b`?**
   - Typically, the constraints would be 1 <= n <= 10^9 and 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
   
2. **What should be returned if `a` and `b` are the same?**
   - The smallest numbers can only be multiples of `a` (or `b`).

3. **Should the result always be positive?**
   - Since it's modulo `10^9 + 7`, the result will always be non-negative.

### Strategy:

1. **Understand the problem**:
   - We need to find the nth number that is divisible by either `a` or `b`. This can be solved efficiently by using a binary search approach.

2. **Key Concepts**:
   - **Binary Search**: To efficiently locate the nth magical number without generating all possible numbers.
   - **Least Common Multiple (LCM)**: It will help in calculating the overlaps between multiples of `a` and `b`.

3. **Steps to Solve**:
   1. **Calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM)**:
      - Using the formula `LCM(a, b) = (a * b) / GCD(a, b)`.
   2. **Use Binary Search**:
      - Set the initial bounds of the binary search. The smallest possible magical number is `1`, and the possible upper bound can be `n * min(a, b)`.
      - For each middle point in the binary search, count how many numbers are divisible by `a`, `b`, or both.
      - Adjust the search range based on the count relative to `n`.

4. **Check the result**:
   - Use modulo `10^9 + 7` for the final result.

### Code:
```java
public class NthMagicalNumber {
    public int nthMagicalNumber(int n, int a, int b) {
        long MOD = 1_000_000_007;
        long lcm = lcm(a, b);
        long low = 1;
        long high = (long)n * Math.min(a, b);
        
        while (low < high) {
            long mid = low + (high - low) / 2;
            
            // Count how many numbers <= mid are divisible by either a or b.
            long count = mid / a + mid / b - mid / lcm;
            
            if (count < n) {
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = mid;
            }
        }
        
        return (int)(low % MOD);
    }

    // Helper method to calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD)
    private long gcd(long x, long y) {
        if (y == 0) {
            return x;
        }
        return gcd(y, x % y);
    }

    // Helper method to calculate the Least Common Multiple (LCM)
    private long lcm(long x, long y) {
        return (x * y) / gcd(x, y);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NthMagicalNumber solver = new NthMagicalNumber();
        System.out.println(solver.nthMagicalNumber(1, 2, 3)); // Output: 2
        System.out.println(solver.nthMagicalNumber(4, 2, 3)); // Output: 6
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Binary Search Complexity**: O(log(n * min(a, b)))
- Each calculation (GCD, LCM, count calculation) inside the binary search is O(log(min(a, b))).
- **Overall Complexity**: O(log(n * min(a, b)) * log(min(a, b)))
