[Leetcode 1774. Closest Dessert Cost](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1774)
### Problem Statement

You would like to make dessert and are preparing to buy ingredients. You have `n` different types of ice cream base cost options, represented as an integer array `baseCosts` and `m` different types of topping options, represented as an integer array `toppingCosts`.

You want to make a dessert with a total cost as close as possible to `target`. You can use each topping at most once (0 or 1 for each). You must use exactly one base.

Return the closest possible cost of the dessert to the `target`. If there are multiple, return the lower one.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the topping be used without any base?**
   - No, you must use exactly one base.

2. **Can toppings be combined in any quantity?**
   - Each topping can be used either 0 or 1 time.

3. **What are the constraints on the sizes of `baseCosts`, `toppingCosts`, and `target`?**
   - The constraints are as follows:
     - `1 <= baseCosts.length, toppingCosts.length <= 10`
     - `1 <= baseCosts[i], toppingCosts[i] <= 10^4`
     - `1 <= target <= 10^4`

### Strategy

1. **Brute Force Option for Small Input Sizes:**
   - Given the constraints, we can afford a brute-force approach.
   - Calculate the cost for every possible combination of the base and the toppings (considering each topping only 0 or 1 time).
   - For each combination, calculate the absolute difference from the target.
   - Keep track of the result which has the smallest absolute difference, breaking ties by choosing the smaller cost.

2. **DFS with Memoization:**
   - Another approach could be to use DFS with memoization to avoid recalculations and to prune unnecessary branches in the search tree.

We'll begin with the brute-force approach for its simplicity given the small input constraints.

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int closestCost(int[] baseCosts, int[] toppingCosts, int target) {
        int closest = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int base : baseCosts) {
            closest = findClosest(base, base, toppingCosts, 0, target, closest);
        }
        return closest;
    }

    // A helper method to find the closest cost
    private int findClosest(int currentCost, int base, int[] toppingCosts, int index, int target, int closest) {
        // Update closest if current cost is closer to the target
        if (Math.abs(currentCost - target) < Math.abs(closest - target) ||
            (Math.abs(currentCost - target) == Math.abs(closest - target) && currentCost < closest)) {
            closest = currentCost;
        }
        // Return if end of topping options is reached or if current cost surpasses a large threshold (for optimization)
        if (index >= toppingCosts.length || currentCost > 2000) {
            return closest;
        }
        // Option 1: Do not add the current topping
        closest = findClosest(currentCost, base, toppingCosts, index + 1, target, closest);
        // Option 2: Add the current topping once
        closest = findClosest(currentCost + toppingCosts[index], base, toppingCosts, index + 1, target, closest);
        // Option 3: Add the current topping twice (though this strategy didn't specify twice, we consider 0 or 1)
        // closest = findClosest(currentCost + 2 * toppingCosts[index], base, toppingCosts, index + 1, target, closest);
        
        return closest;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The brute-force approach investigates each combination of base and toppings:
  - For each base: `n` bases.
  - Each topping can be selected or not: `2^m` combinations for `m` toppings.
  - Hence, the total complexity is `O(n * 2^m)`.
  
  Given constraints ensure this is feasible (`n, m <= 10`).

- **Space Complexity:** `O(m)` for the recursive call stack depth.
