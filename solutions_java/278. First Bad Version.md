[Leetcode 278. First Bad Version](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l278)
### Problem Statement:
You are a product manager, and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]`, and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `boolean isBadVersion(int version)` which returns whether version is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What is the range of `n` (the number of versions)?**
   - The range can be very large, typically in the order of millions.
   
2. **Does the function `isBadVersion(int version)` take a constant time to execute?**
   - Yes, assume that the function takes constant time.

3. **Can we assume that there is at least one bad version in the list of versions?**
   - Yes, you can assume that there is at least one bad version.

### Strategy:
To minimize the number of calls to `isBadVersion`, a binary search strategy is appropriate. Binary search will reduce the number of calls to the function from O(n) to O(log n).

1. **Initialize** two pointers `left` and `right` to 1 and `n` respectively.
2. **While** the left pointer is less than the right pointer:
   - Calculate the middle version `mid = left + (right - left) / 2`.
   - Use the `isBadVersion(mid)` to check if `mid` is a bad version.
     - If `mid` is a bad version, then the first bad version must be at `mid` or before it, so adjust the right pointer to `mid`.
     - If `mid` is not a bad version, then the first bad version must be after `mid`, so adjust the left pointer to `mid + 1`.
3. **At the end of the loop**, the left pointer should point to the first bad version.

### Code:
```java
public class Solution extends VersionControl {
    public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = n;

        while (left < right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;

            if (isBadVersion(mid)) {
                right = mid; // Look on the left side including mid
            } else {
                left = mid + 1; // Look on the right side excluding mid
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** O(log n) — Due to the binary search approach.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) — Only a few variables are used for pointers, so space complexity is constant.

This solution efficiently finds the first bad version by reducing the problem size in half with each iteration.
