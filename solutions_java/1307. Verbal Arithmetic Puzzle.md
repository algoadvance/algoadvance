[Leetcode 1307. Verbal Arithmetic Puzzle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1307)
### Problem Statement

You are given an equation, represented by two lists of strings `words` and `result`. The equation is of the form:

```
words[0] + words[1] + ... + words[n-1] = result
```

Where each word in the list `words` and the string `result` are non-empty strings that contain only uppercase English letters. Each letter in the strings can be mapped to a digit from 0 to 9 (different letters must be mapped to different digits), leading zeroes are not allowed.

Your task is to determine if there is a valid way to assign digits to letters such that the equation holds true.

### Example

```java
Input: words = ["SEND", "MORE"], result = "MONEY"
Output: true
Explanation: "9567" + "1085" = "10652"
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the words and result guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, all words and the result are non-empty strings.

2. **Can words and the result contain multiple instances of the same letter?**
   - Yes, they can contain multiple instances of the same letter, but different letters must map to different digits.

3. **Are the strings guaranteed to be valid with leading zeros not causing contradictions?**
   - Yes, as long as the mapped value of each string does not have a leading zero except if the string itself is just "0".

4. **What should be returned if no valid digit mapping exists?**
   - The function should return `false`.

### Strategy

1. **Character Set**: Extract all unique characters from the `words` and `result`.
2. **Permutation**: Generate all possible permutations of numbers for these characters.
3. **Validation**: For each permutation, map the characters to the numbers, and check if the equation holds.
4. **Constraint Check**: Ensure no word in `words` or the `result` has a leading zero unless the word itself consists of a single character.

### Time Complexity

This problem inherently has a factorial time complexity O(10^n), with n being the number of unique characters, due to the need to test permutations of digits.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class VerbalArithmeticPuzzle {

    // Main function to solve the verbal arithmetic puzzle
    public boolean isSolvable(String[] words, String result) {
        // Collect all unique characters
        Set<Character> uniqueChars = new HashSet<>();
        for (String word : words) {
            for (char ch : word.toCharArray()) {
                uniqueChars.add(ch);
            }
        }
        for (char ch : result.toCharArray()) {
            uniqueChars.add(ch);
        }
        
        // Convert the set to an array list for index based access
        List<Character> charsList = new ArrayList<>(uniqueChars);
        if (charsList.size() > 10) {
            return false; // More than 10 unique characters means no valid digit mapping is possible
        }
        
        // Start checking permutations
        return permuteAndCheck(words, result, charsList, new int[10], new boolean[10], 0);
    }
    
    // Helper method to generate permutations and check validity
    private boolean permuteAndCheck(String[] words, String result, List<Character> charsList, int[] charDigitMap, boolean[] usedDigits, int index) {
        if (index == charsList.size()) {
            return checkEquation(words, result, charDigitMap, charsList);
        }
        
        for (int digit = 0; digit <= 9; digit++) {
            if (!usedDigits[digit]) {
                usedDigits[digit] = true;
                charDigitMap[charsList.get(index)] = digit;
                if (permuteAndCheck(words, result, charsList, charDigitMap, usedDigits, index + 1)) {
                    return true;
                }
                usedDigits[digit] = false;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    // Helper method to evaluate if current mappings satisfy the equation
    private boolean checkEquation(String[] words, String result, int[] charDigitMap, List<Character> charsList) {
        long sum = 0;
        for (String word : words) {
            sum += wordToNumber(word, charDigitMap);
        }
        long res = wordToNumber(result, charDigitMap);
        return sum == res;
    }
    
    // Convert a word to its numeric value based on the current character-digit mappings
    private long wordToNumber(String word, int[] charDigitMap) {
        long num = 0;
        for (char ch : word.toCharArray()) {
            num = num * 10 + charDigitMap[ch];
        }
        return num;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        VerbalArithmeticPuzzle solver = new VerbalArithmeticPuzzle();
        String[] words = {"SEND", "MORE"};
        String result = "MONEY";
        System.out.println(solver.isSolvable(words, result));
    }
}
```

This code systematically tries all permutations of digit assignments to the characters while ensuring that no number begins with zero. It employs a recursive approach to generate permutations and validate them with the equation.
