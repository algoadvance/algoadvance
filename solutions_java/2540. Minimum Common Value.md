[Leetcode 2540. Minimum Common Value](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2540)
### Problem Statement

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` sorted in non-decreasing order, return the *minimum integer common to both arrays*. If there is no common integer amongst `nums1` and `nums2`, return `-1`. 

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints of the input arrays?**
   - The lengths of `nums1` and `nums2` can be up to `10^5`.
   - The elements of `nums1` and `nums2` can range from `1` to `10^9`.

2. **Can the arrays contain duplicate elements?**
   - Yes, the arrays can contain duplicate elements, but since we are looking for the minimum integer common to both arrays, duplicates do not affect the minimum value found.

3. **What should be returned if no common value exists?**
   - Return `-1` if there is no common value.

4. **Are the arrays always given in sorted order?**
   - Yes, both arrays are given sorted in non-decreasing order.

### Strategy

Considering that both arrays are sorted, we can efficiently find the minimum common value using a two-pointer technique. 

1. Start with two pointers, each pointing to the beginning of `nums1` and `nums2`.
2. Compare the elements at both pointers.
   - If they are equal, this is a common element. It is the smallest because the arrays are sorted, so we return this element immediately.
   - If the element in `nums1` is smaller, increment the pointer in `nums1` to try and find a larger element that might match the current element in `nums2`.
   - If the element in `nums2` is smaller, increment the pointer in `nums2` to try and find a larger element that might match the current element in `nums1`.
3. If the end of any array is reached without finding a common element, return `-1`.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is `O(m + n)`, where `m` is the length of `nums1` and `n` is the length of `nums2`. This is because each element in both `nums1` and `nums2` is processed at most once.

### Code

Here's the Java implementation of the solution:

```java
public class MinimumCommonValue {
    public int getCommon(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int pointer1 = 0;
        int pointer2 = 0;
        
        while (pointer1 < nums1.length && pointer2 < nums2.length) {
            if (nums1[index1] == nums2[index2]) {
                return nums1[index1];
            } else if (nums1[index1] < nums2[index2]) {
                pointer1++;
            } else {
                pointer2++;
            }
        }
        
        return -1; // No common element found
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumCommonValue sol = new MinimumCommonValue();
        int[] nums1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int[] nums2 = {3, 5, 7, 9};
        System.out.println(sol.getCommon(nums1, nums2)); // Output: 3
        
        int[] nums1_2 = {6, 7, 8, 9};
        int[] nums2_2 = {1, 2, 3, 10};
        System.out.println(sol.getCommon(nums1_2, nums2_2)); // Output: -1
    }
}
```

This code defines a method `getCommon` which implements the above strategy using two pointers to find the minimum common value or determine that no common element exists. The `main` method provides some sample inputs to test the function.
