[Leetcode 1324. Print Words Vertically](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1324)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`. Return all the words vertically in the same order in which they appear in the string. Words are returned as a list of strings, complete with spaces, with trailing spaces removed from each string.

A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. Each vertical column will be formed by taking characters from a specific position across all words (left to right), including spaces to align words properly for printing vertically.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of the string? (This helps in determining if there are any constraints on memory or processing time)
   - How are spaces between words treated? Are multiple spaces allowed?

2. **Output Constraints:**
   - Should the words be returned exactly vertically aligned, including spaces?
   - Should letters be strictly taken one by one from each word when constructing the vertical output?

3. **Examples:**
   - What is the expected output for edge cases like an empty string or a string with only one word?

Given a string, your task is to return the list of words vertically aligned as described.

Example:
```java
Input: "HOW ARE YOU"
Output: ["HAY", "ORO", "WEU"]

Input: "TO BE OR NOT TO BE"
Output: ["TBONTB", "OEROOE", "   T"]
```

### Strategy

1. **Split the Input:**
   - Split the input string into words based on spaces.

2. **Determine Maximum Word Length:**
   - Find out the maximum length of the words to determine the number of vertical columns needed.

3. **Construct Vertical Words:**
   - For each position (from 0 to max length - 1), construct the vertical word by iterating through each word.
   - If the current word length is less than the position index, append a space.

4. **Remove Trailing Spaces:**
   - After constructing each vertical word, strip trailing spaces to meet the output requirements.

### Code

Here's a Java implementation of the above strategy:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class VerticalWords {
    public List<String> printVertically(String s) {
        // Split the input string into words
        String[] words = s.split(" ");
        
        // Determine the maximum length among the words
        int maxLen = 0;
        for (String word : words) {
            if (word.length() > maxLen) {
                maxLen = word.length();
            }
        }
        
        // Prepare the list to store the vertical words
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Construct each vertical word
        for (int i = 0; i < maxLen; i++) {
            StringBuilder verticalWord = new StringBuilder();
            for (String word : words) {
                if (i < word.length()) {
                    verticalWord.append(word.charAt(i));
                } else {
                    verticalWord.append(' ');
                }
            }
            // Remove trailing spaces
            while (verticalWord.length() > 0 && verticalWord.charAt(verticalWord.length() - 1) == ' ') {
                verticalWord.deleteCharAt(verticalWord.length() - 1);
            }
            // Add the constructed vertical word to the result
            result.add(verticalWord.toString());
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        VerticalWords vw = new VerticalWords();
        System.out.println(vw.printVertically("HOW ARE YOU")); // Output: ["HAY", "ORO", "WEU"]
        System.out.println(vw.printVertically("TO BE OR NOT TO BE")); // Output: ["TBONTB", "OEROOE", "   T"]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Splitting the String:** O(n), where n is the length of the input string.
- **Finding Maximum Length:** O(m), where m is the number of words.
- **Constructing Vertical Words:** 
  - Outer loop runs `maxLen` times.
  - Inner loop runs `m` times for each position.
  - Overall: O(maxLen * m).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is approximately O(n + maxLen * m). Given that `maxLen` is related to `n` (as it's the length of the longest word in the input string), the complexity can be approximated as O(n + n * m), which simplifies to O(n * m) as the dominant term.
