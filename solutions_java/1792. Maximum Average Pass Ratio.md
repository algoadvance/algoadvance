[Leetcode 1792. Maximum Average Pass Ratio](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1792)
## Problem Statement

**1792. Maximum Average Pass Ratio**

There is a school that has `n` classes. Each class has a certain number of students passing and a certain number of students taking the class. You are given a 2D array `classes`, where `classes[i] = [pass_i, total_i]` indicates that `i`-th class has `pass_i` students passed out of `total_i` students. 

You are also given an integer `extraStudents`. You can distribute the `extraStudents` to any class with the goal of maximizing the **average pass ratio** across all the classes.

The **pass ratio** of a class is defined as the ratio of `pass_i` to `total_i`.

The overall **average pass ratio** is the sum of the pass ratios of all the classes divided by `n`.

Return the maximum possible average pass ratio after distributing the `extraStudents`.

### Examples

**Example 1:**

- Input: `classes = [[1,2],[3,5],[2,2]], extraStudents = 2`
- Output: `0.78333`

**Example 2:**

- Input: `classes = [[2,4],[3,9],[4,5],[2,10]], extraStudents = 4`
- Output: `0.53485`

### Constraints

- `1 <= classes.length <= 10^5`
- `classes[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= pass_i <= total_i <= 10^5`
- `1 <= extraStudents <= 10^5`


## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned as output?** - Return the maximum possible average pass ratio after distributing all extra students.
2. **How precise should the answer be?** - The answer should be as precise as possible within reasonable floating-point arithmetic precision.

## Strategy

1. **Identify the Impact of Each Student Added:** For each class, calculate the impact of adding one student in terms of improvement in the pass ratio.
2. **Maximize Overall Increase Using a Max-Heap:** Use a max-heap (priority queue) to always distribute an extra student to the class where it results in the maximum improvement in the pass ratio.
3. **Repeat for All Extra Students:** Distribute all extra students using the above strategy.
4. **Calculate the Final Average Pass Ratio:** After distributing all extra students, calculate the final average pass ratio.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Define the Pass Ratio Difference Function:** 
    - For a class with `pass_i` and `total_i` students, calculate the change in pass ratio if one extra student is added:
    \[
    \Delta = \left(\frac{pass_i + 1}{total_i + 1}\right) - \left(\frac{pass_i}{total_i}\right)
    \]

2. **Use a Priority Queue (Max-Heap):**
    - Initialize a max-heap to always consider the class with the highest potential increase.
    - Calculate and store the initial pass ratio difference of each class in the max-heap.

3. **Distribute the Students:**
    - Extract the class with the maximum increase from the heap.
    - Update the values (`pass_i` and `total_i`) for that class.
    - Recalculate the new difference for that class and push it back into the heap.

4. **Compute the Final Average Pass Ratio:** 
    - Sum the pass ratios of all classes and divide by the number of classes.

## Code Implementation

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public class Solution {
    public double maxAverageRatio(int[][] classes, int extraStudents) {
        
        // Priority queue for storing the change in pass ratio (with reverse order for max-heap)
        PriorityQueue<double[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> Double.compare(b[0], a[0]));
        
        // Initialize the priority queue with current ratios
        for (int[] cls : classes) {
            int pass = cls[0];
            int total = cls[1];
            double currentRatio = (double) pass / total;
            double potentialGain = ((double)(pass + 1) / (total + 1)) - currentRatio;
            pq.offer(new double[] {potentialGain, pass, total});
        }
        
        // Distribute extra students
        while (extraStudents > 0) {
            double[] top = pq.poll();
            double currentGain = top[0];
            int pass = (int)top[1];
            int total = (int)top[2];
            
            // Update pass and total
            pass += 1;
            total += 1;
            
            double newRatio = (double) pass / total;
            double newPotentialGain = ((double)(pass + 1) / (total + 1)) - newRatio;
            
            // Push updated values back into the priority queue
            pq.offer(new double[] {newPotentialGain, pass, total});
            
            // One extra student distributed
            extraStudents--;
        }
        
        // Calculate final average pass ratio
        double totalAverage = 0.0;
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            double[] cls = pq.poll();
            double pass = cls[1];
            double total = cls[2];
            totalAverage += pass / total;
        }
        
        return totalAverage / classes.length;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization of Heap:** \( O(n \log n) \)
- **Distributing Students:** \( O(extraStudents \log n) \)
- **Final Calculation of Average:** \( O(n) \)

Thus, the overall time complexity is \( O((n + extraStudents) \log n) \).

This solution ensures we efficiently find the maximum potential gain for each extra student and overall ensure the best possible average pass ratio.
