[Leetcode 967. Numbers With Same Consecutive Differences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l967)
## Problem Statement
Given two integers `n` and `k`, return a list of all the integers of length `n` where the difference between every two consecutive digits is `k`. You may return the answer in any order.

Note that the integers should not have leading zeros. 

#### Example 1:
- **Input:** n = 3, k = 7
- **Output:** [181,292,707,818,929]

#### Example 2:
- **Input:** n = 2, k = 1
- **Output:** [10,12,21,23,32,34,43,45,54,56,65,67,76,78,87,89,98]

### Constraints:
- 2 <= n <= 9
- 0 <= k <= 9

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `n` be greater than 9?**
   - No, the constraint specifies that `n` is between 2 and 9.
2. **Would inputs have special cases like all digits being the same?**
   - Not necessarily; it depends on the value of `k`.
3. **Should the output be sorted?**
   - No, the output can be in any order.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to build numbers of length `n` while maintaining and checking the consecutive digit difference. Here's a step-by-step plan:

1. **Initialization**: Start with each digit from 1 to 9 as the first digit (since numbers cannot have leading zeros).
2. **DFS Function**: Create a DFS function to add digits to the current number.
   - Base Case: If the current length of the number equals `n`, add it to the result list.
   - Recursive Case: Try adding a new digit that is either `currentLastDigit + k` or `currentLastDigit - k` if it forms a valid digit (between 0 and 9).
3. **Execution**: For each starting digit, use the DFS function to generate all possible valid numbers.

## Solution Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> numsSameConsecDiff(int n, int k) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int num = 1; num <= 9; num++) {
            dfs(n, k, num, 1, result);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    private void dfs(int n, int k, int currentNum, int currentLength, List<Integer> result) {
        if (currentLength == n) {
            result.add(currentNum);
            return;
        }
        
        int lastDigit = currentNum % 10;
        
        if (lastDigit + k <= 9) {
            dfs(n, k, currentNum * 10 + (lastDigit + k), currentLength + 1, result);
        }
        
        if (k != 0 && lastDigit - k >= 0) {
            dfs(n, k, currentNum * 10 + (lastDigit - k), currentLength + 1, result);
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.numsSameConsecDiff(3, 7)); // [181, 292, 707, 818, 929]
        System.out.println(sol.numsSameConsecDiff(2, 1)); // [10, 12, 21, 23, ..., 98]
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(2^n). Since for each position, the number can have up to 2 choices (adding `k` or subtracting `k`), this results in an exponential number of possibilities. However, since n is relatively small (maximum 9), this is feasible.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n). This is due to the maximum depth of the recursive call stack which is related to the number of digits `n`.

By following the aforementioned strategy, the problem can be solved efficiently within the given constraints.
