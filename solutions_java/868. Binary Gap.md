[Leetcode 868. Binary Gap](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l868)
### Problem Statement
Given a positive integer `n`, find and return the longest distance between any two consecutive 1's in the binary representation of `n`. If there are no two consecutive 1's, return 0.

### Clarifying Questions
Before diving into the solution, let's clarify a few points:
1. **Input Constraints**: What is the range of the input integer `n`? 
   - Answer: `1 <= n <= 10^9`
2. **Output Type**: What is the output type? 
   - Answer: The output is an integer representing the longest distance.

### Strategy
Here's a step-by-step approach to solve this problem:

1. **Convert to Binary**: Convert the integer `n` into its binary form.
2. **Identify Positions**: Traverse the binary string and record the positions of all '1's.
3. **Compute Gaps**: Calculate the distances between consecutive positions of '1'.
4. **Find Maximum Gap**: Return the maximum distance found.

### Code
Below is the Java code that implements the above strategy:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int binaryGap(int n) {
        String binaryString = Integer.toBinaryString(n);
        int lastPos = -1;
        int maxDistance = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < binaryString.length(); i++) {
            if (binaryString.charAt(i) == '1') {
                if (lastPos != -1) {
                    maxDistance = Math.max(maxDistance, i - lastPos);
                }
                lastPos = i;
            }
        }
        
        return maxDistance;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.binaryGap(22)); // Output: 2
        System.out.println(solution.binaryGap(5));  // Output: 2
        System.out.println(solution.binaryGap(6));  // Output: 1
        System.out.println(solution.binaryGap(8));  // Output: 0
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Conversion to Binary**: Converting an integer `n` to a binary string takes \(O(\log n)\) time.
- **Traversal of Binary String**: Traversing the string takes \(O(\log n)\) time, where \(\log n\) is the length of the binary representation of `n`. 
- **Overall Time Complexity**: Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(\log n)\).

### Explanation
1. The `Integer.toBinaryString(n)` method converts the integer `n` to its binary representation.
2. We then iterate through the binary string to find positions where the character is '1'.
3. We calculate the distance between the current position of '1' and the last position of '1', updating the maximum distance found.
4. If no two consecutive '1's are found, the program will correctly return 0.
