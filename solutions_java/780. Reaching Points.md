[Leetcode 780. Reaching Points](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l780)
### Problem Statement:
Given four integers `sx`, `sy`, `tx`, and `ty`, you have a starting point `(sx, sy)` and a target point `(tx, ty)` on an infinite 2D grid. In one move, you can:
1. Move from `(x, y)` to `(x, x + y)`
2. Move from `(x, y)` to `(x + y, y)`

Return `true` if you can reach the target point `(tx, ty)` from the starting point `(sx, sy)`, otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Are the starting and target points guaranteed to be positive integers?**
   - Yes.
2. **Can the target point be smaller than the starting point?**
   - No, working backward helps ensure we don't go into negative coordinates or lesser values.

### Strategy:
Instead of trying to reach `(tx, ty)` from `(sx, sy)` directly (which would involve a lot of recursive calls and is inefficient), we work backward from `(tx, ty)` to `(sx, sy)`. By observing the allowed moves, we can reverse them:
- If `tx > ty`, `(tx, ty)` could have only come from `(tx - ty, ty)`.
- If `ty > tx`, `(tx,ty)` could have only come from `(tx, ty - tx)`.

We use modulo to speed this up for significant reductions:
- If `tx > ty`, it must be of the form `(tx % ty == sx)` and vice versa for `ty > tx`.

Continue applying modulo on larger coordinates until it matches or becomes infeasible.

### Code:

```java
public class ReachingPoints {
    public boolean reachingPoints(int sx, int sy, int tx, int ty) {
        while (tx > sx && ty > sy) {
            if (tx > ty) {
                tx %= ty;
            } else {
                ty %= tx;
            }
        }
        
        if (tx == sx && ty == sy) {
            return true;
        } else if (tx == sx) {
            return ty > sy && (ty - sy) % sx == 0;
        } else if (ty == sy) {
            return tx > sx && (tx - sx) % sy == 0;
        }
        
        return false;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ReachingPoints rp = new ReachingPoints();
        System.out.println(rp.reachingPoints(1, 1, 3, 5)); // Output: true
        System.out.println(rp.reachingPoints(1, 1, 2, 2)); // Output: false
        System.out.println(rp.reachingPoints(1, 1, 1, 1)); // Output: true
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Worst-case time complexity:** `O(max(tx, ty))`. This is because the `%` operation helps in significant reductions until it is infeasible (converging quickly).
- **Average-case time complexity:** Often much lower due to typical rapid reductions with modulo.
