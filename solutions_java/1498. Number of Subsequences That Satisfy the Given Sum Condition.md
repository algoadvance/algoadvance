[Leetcode 1498. Number of Subsequences That Satisfy the Given Sum Condition](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1498)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, return the number of non-empty subsequences of `nums` such that the sum of the minimum and maximum element on it is less or equal to `target`. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the elements of `nums` be negative?**
   - No, `nums` will contain only non-negative integers.
   
2. **What is the range of values for `nums` and `target`?**
   - The length of `nums` will be between `1` and `10^5`.
   - The values of `nums[i]` will be between `0` and `10^6`.
   - The value of `target` can be at most `10^6`.

3. **Do we need to account for the case where `nums` is empty?**
   - The problem constrains guarantee at least one element in `nums`.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting will allow the two-pointer technique for efficiently counting the valid subsequences.
2. **Two-Pointer Technique**: Use two pointers, one starting at the beginning (`left`) and one at the end (`right`) of the sorted array.
3. **Count Subsequences**:
   - If the sum of the smallest (`nums[left]`) and largest (`nums[right]`) elements is less than or equal to `target`, it means every subsequence that includes `nums[left]` and any subset of elements from `left+1` to `right` will satisfy the condition. 
   - Count the number of these valid subsequences using the formula for subsets.
4. **Modulo Operation**: Since the result can be large, take modulo `10^9 + 7` at each step.

### Code

Here is the Java implementation of the above strategy:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int numSubseq(int[] nums, int target) {
        int MOD = 1_000_000_007;
        int n = nums.length;
        
        // Sorting the array
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        
        // Initialize two pointers
        int left = 0, right = n - 1;
        
        // Precompute powers of 2 up to n
        int[] power = new int[n];
        power[0] = 1;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            power[i] = (power[i - 1] * 2) % MOD;
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        while (left <= right) {
            if (nums[left] + nums[right] <= target) {
                count = (count + power[right - left]) % MOD;
                left++;
            } else {
                right--;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- **Sorting**: We start by sorting `nums` to easily find the minimum and maximum of any subsequence.
- **Two Pointers (`left` and `right`)**: We initialize two pointers, `left` at the start and `right` at the end of `nums`.
- **Counting Subsequences**: If `nums[left] + nums[right] <= target`, the number of valid subsequences is `2^(right-left)`. This counts all subsets consisting of elements between `left` and `right` inclusive.
- **Move Pointers**:
  - If the sum is valid, move `left` pointer to include more subsequences.
  - If the sum is invalid, decrement the `right` pointer.
- **Modulo Operation**: Result is taken modulo `10^9 + 7` at every addition to prevent overflow.

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: O(n log n) for sorting the array.
- **Precomputation of Powers**: O(n) as we are computing powers of 2 up to `n`.
- **Two-Pointer Traversal**: O(n) since each pointer moves at most `n` steps.

Thus, the overall complexity is `O(n log n)` due to sorting.
