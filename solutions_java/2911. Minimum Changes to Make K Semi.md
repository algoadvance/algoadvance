[Leetcode 2911. Minimum Changes to Make K Semi](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2911)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s` and an integer `k`, you need to form `k` semi-palindromes from `s` using minimum characters changes. A string is called a semi-palindrome if it can be reordered to make a palindrome. Find out the minimum number of characters changes required to make `k` semi-palindromes from `s`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
   - What is the range for `k`?

2. **String Composition**:
   - Does the string `s` contain only lowercase English letters?
   
3. **Output**:
   - Do you need to return just the count of character changes needed?

Answers to these would help to better understand how to approach the problem effectively. For now, I will proceed with the assumption that the character set is lowercase English letters, and `s` and `k` satisfy typical constraints (e.g., `1 <= s.length <= 10^5` and `1 <= k <= s.length`).

### Strategy
1. **Count Frequencies**: 
   Calculate the frequency of each character in the string `s`.

2. **Divide String into Parts**:
   - Split the string into `k` parts as evenly as possible.

3. **Analyze Each Part for Palindrome Feasibility**:
   For each part, determine how many changes are needed to make the character frequencies suitable for forming a palindrome. The key is that in a palindromic substring, at most one character can have an odd frequency (in the middle of the palindrome).

4. **Greedy Approach**:
   - Distribute characters optimally during the division to reduce the necessary changes.

### Code

Here is the Java code to solve the problem:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class MinimumChangesToMakeKSemiPalindromes {
    public int minChangesToMakeKSemiPalindromes(String s, int k) {
        if (k == 1) {
            // If k is 1, we only need to make the entire string a palindrome
            return minChangesToMakePalindrome(s);
        }

        int n = s.length();
        if (k > n) return -1; // impossible to split into more parts than characters

        int partLength = n / k;
        int extraCharacters = n % k;
        int minChanges = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            int start = i * partLength + Math.min(i, extraCharacters);
            int end = (i + 1) * partLength + Math.min(i + 1, extraCharacters);

            String part = s.substring(start, end);
            minChanges += minChangesToMakePalindrome(part);
        }

        return minChanges;
    }

    private int minChangesToMakePalindrome(String part) {
        int[] freq = new int[26];
        for (char ch : part.toCharArray()) {
            freq[ch - 'a']++;
        }

        int changesNeeded = 0;
        boolean oddAllowed = (part.length() % 2 != 0);
        for (int count : freq) {
            if (count % 2 != 0) {
                if (oddAllowed) {
                    oddAllowed = false;
                } else {
                    changesNeeded++;
                }
            }
        }
        return changesNeeded / 2;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumChangesToMakeKSemiPalindromes solver = new MinimumChangesToMakeKSemiPalindromes();
        System.out.println(solver.minChangesToMakeKSemiPalindromes("aabbccddee", 2)); // Example usage
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Counting Frequencies**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string.
- **Dividing and Calculating Changes**: O(k * (n/k)) = O(n).

Overall, the time complexity of the solution is O(n), making it efficient for large strings.
