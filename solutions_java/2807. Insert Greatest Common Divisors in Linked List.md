[Leetcode 2807. Insert Greatest Common Divisors in Linked List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2807)
### Problem Statement
Given a linked list of positive integers, the task is to insert the Greatest Common Divisors (GCD) between each consecutive pair of elements in the linked list.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format**: Is the linked list singly or doubly linked?
   - This is typically a singly linked list.
   
2. **Output Format**: Should the function return the modified linked list?
   - Yes, the function should return the head of the modified linked list.
   
3. **List Size**: Can we assume that the list contains at least two nodes?
   - Yes, we assume the list contains at least two nodes as GCD between nodes requires at least two numbers.
   
4. **Node Structure**: How is the linked list node defined?
   - For this problem, a typical definition `ListNode` is used:
     ```java
     class ListNode {
         int val;
         ListNode next;
         ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
     }
     ```

### Strategy
1. Traverse each pair of consecutive nodes in the list.
2. For each pair, calculate the GCD of their values.
3. Insert a new node containing the GCD value between the current pair of nodes.
4. Continue this process until reaching the end of the list.

### Code
```java
class ListNode {
    int val;
    ListNode next;
    ListNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

class Solution {
    public ListNode insertGCDs(ListNode head) {
        if (head == null || head.next == null) {
            return head;
        }
        
        ListNode current = head;
        
        while (current != null && current.next != null) {
            int gcdValue = gcd(current.val, current.next.val);
            ListNode gcdNode = new ListNode(gcdValue);
            gcdNode.next = current.next;
            current.next = gcdNode;
            current = gcdNode.next;
        }
        
        return head;
    }
    
    private int gcd(int a, int b) {
        if (b == 0) {
            return a;
        }
        return gcd(b, a % b);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **GCD Calculation**: Calculating GCD for each pair takes `O(log(min(a, b)))` time. However, constant-time GCD calculations are generally considered feasible in average circumstances.
- **Traversal**: The traversal of the linked list takes `O(n)` time because each node is only visited a finite number of times.
- **Insertion**: Each insertion operation after computing GCD is `O(1)`.

Overall, the time complexity of the solution is `O(n * log(min(a, b)))` where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list and `a` and `b` are node values.

### Space Complexity
- **Additional Nodes**: We are inserting a node for each GCD, which means we'll end up with `2n - 1` nodes. Since we are not using any auxiliary data structures beyond constant space requirements, the additional space complexity is `O(n)` for the new nodes.

Given these complexities, the solution is efficient for typical linked list sizes encountered in competitive programming and interview problems.
