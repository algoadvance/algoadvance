[Leetcode 861. Score After Flipping Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l861)
### Problem Statement

You are given a matrix consisting of 0s and 1s, and you can perform any number of the following operations:

1. Flip a row: Change all 0s to 1s and all 1s to 0s in that row.
2. Flip a column: Change all 0s to 1s and all 1s to 0s in that column.

After each operation, every element of the matrix must still be either 0 or 1. You want to maximize the score after any number of operations. The score is obtained by interpreting each row of the matrix as a binary number, and then summing these numbers.

Your task is to return the maximum possible score.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Matrix Dimensions:** Is there a guaranteed minimum or maximum for the dimensions of the input matrix?
   - Usually, this is not explicitly constrained, but typical constraints range for values that fit within reasonable computational limits.

2. **Matrix Contents:** Is it always guaranteed that the matrix contains only 0s and 1s?
   - Yes, the problem states that the matrix consists only of 0s and 1s.

3. **Expected Output:** How should the score be returned, integer, long, string...?
   - The score should be returned as an integer.

4. **Edge Cases:** Should we consider edge cases such as the smallest matrix (1x1) or all elements being 0s?
   - Yes, you should consider edge cases in your implementation.

### Strategy

To maximize the score:
1. **Ensure Left-most Column is Maximized:** Convert the left-most bit of every row to 1 by flipping necessary rows. This ensures that each row's value is at least half of the highest possible value.
2. **Maximize Column Values Starting from the Left:** For each subsequent column, determine if flipping that column will result in more 1s than the original. If yes, perform the flip.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the strategy:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int matrixScore(int[][] grid) {
        int rows = grid.length;
        int cols = grid[0].length;
        
        // Step 1: Ensure all rows have a leading 1 by flipping rows if necessary.
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            if (grid[i][0] == 0) {
                flipRow(grid, i);
            }
        }
        
        // Step 2: Optimize each column to maximize the number of 1s.
        for (int j = 1; j < cols; j++) {
            int numOnes = 0;
            // Count the number of 1s in the current column
            for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    numOnes++;
                }
            }
            // If more than half of the column elements are 0s, flip the column
            if (numOnes < (rows + 1) / 2) {
                flipColumn(grid, j);
            }
        }
        
        // Step 3: Calculate the final score
        int score = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
            int rowValue = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
                rowValue = rowValue * 2 + grid[i][j];
            }
            score += rowValue;
        }
        
        return score;
    }
    
    private void flipRow(int[][] grid, int row) {
        for (int j = 0; j < grid[0].length; j++) {
            grid[row][j] ^= 1;
        }
    }
    
    private void flipColumn(int[][] grid, int col) {
        for (int i = 0; i < grid.length; i++) {
            grid[i][col] ^= 1;
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Flipping Rows:** O(N) where N is the number of rows.
- **Counting Column 1s and Potentially Flipping Columns:** O(N * M) where N is the number of rows and M is the number of columns.
- **Calculating Final Score:** O(N * M)

Overall, the time complexity is O(N * M), which is efficient for typical input sizes expected in competitive programming.
