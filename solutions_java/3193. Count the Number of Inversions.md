[Leetcode 3193. Count the Number of Inversions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3193)
### Problem Statement

In computer science, an inversion is a pair of elements in an array where the elements are out of order. Given an array of integers, count the number of inversions in the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the range of the input array size?
   - Are there any constraints on the elements of the input array (e.g., negative numbers, duplicates)?

2. **Output**:
   - Should I return the count of inversions as an integer value?

### Code

Here's the Java solution using a modified merge sort to count the inversions:

```java
public class InversionCount {
    
    public static int countInversions(int[] arr) {
        if (arr == null || arr.length <= 1) {
            return 0;
        }
        int[] temp = new int[arr.length];
        return mergeSortAndCount(arr, temp, 0, arr.length - 1);
    }
    
    private static int mergeSortAndCount(int[] arr, int[] temp, int left, int right) {
        int mid, invCount = 0;
        if (left < right) {
            mid = (left + right) / 2;
            
            invCount += mergeSortAndCount(arr, temp, left, mid);
            invCount += mergeSortAndCount(arr, temp, mid + 1, right);
            
            invCount += mergeAndCount(arr, temp, left, mid, right);
        }
        return invCount;
    }
    
    private static int mergeAndCount(int[] arr, int[] temp, int left, int mid, int right) {
        int i = left;
        int j = mid + 1;
        int k = left;
        int invCount = 0;
        
        while ((i <= mid) && (j <= right)) {
            if (arr[i] <= arr[j]) {
                temp[k++] = arr[i++];
            } else {
                temp[k++] = arr[j++];
                invCount += (mid + 1) - i;
            }
        }
        
        while (i <= mid) {
            temp[k++] = arr[i++];
        }
        
        while (j <= right) {
            temp[k++] = arr[j++];
        }
        
        for (i = left; i <= right; i++) {
            arr[i] = temp[i];
        }
        
        return invCount;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] arr = {1, 20, 6, 4, 5};
        System.out.println("Number of inversions are: " + countInversions(arr));
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Approach**:
   - We use the merge sort algorithm which allows us to sort the array while counting the inversions.
   - The idea is to count inversions while merging two halves of the array.
   
2. **Steps**:
   - Implement a function `mergeSortAndCount()` which sorts the array and returns the inversion count.
   - Implement a helper function `mergeAndCount()` to merge two sorted halves of the array and count the cross-boundary inversions.

3. **Merging Logic**:
   - During the merge step, if `arr[i]` is greater than `arr[j]` and `i < j`, then there are `(mid - i + 1)` inversions because all elements from `arr[i+1]` to `arr[mid]` are also greater than `arr[j]`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the merge sort function is O(n log n).
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) due to the temporary array used for merging.

This approach ensures that the inversion count is computed efficiently even for larger arrays.
