[Leetcode 2178. Maximum Split of Positive Even Integers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2178)
### Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer `finalSum`. Return a list of all the maximum split of unique positive even integers that sum up to `finalSum`. 

If such a split is not possible, return an empty list.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the definition of "maximum split"?**
   - A split that divides `finalSum` into the maximum number of unique even integers.
   
2. **Can `finalSum` be odd?**
   - No, `finalSum` is a positive integer that will be even.

3. **Is the order of integers in the response list important?**
   - Typically no, but we should return the list in ascending order for better readability.

4. **What should be the behavior for very small values of `finalSum` like 2 or 4?**
   - The function should handle these edge cases and return appropriate splits if possible.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:** Create an empty list to store the result.
2. **Greedy Approach:** Start from the smallest even number (2) and iteratively add the smallest unique even integer possible to the list while keeping track of the remaining sum.
3. **Update Condition:** If adding the next smallest even number exceeds the remaining sum, add the remaining sum itself as a candidate if itâ€™s even and satisfies the conditions.
4. **Termination:** The process will stop when the remaining sum becomes zero or less than the next even integer to add.
5. **Check and Return:** If the process completes and the remaining sum is zero, return the list of split integers. Otherwise, return an empty list.

### Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public List<Long> maximumEvenSplit(long finalSum) {
        List<Long> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Early exit if the finalSum is not even, return empty list
        if (finalSum % 2 != 0) {
            return result;
        }
        
        // Greedy approach to split `finalSum` into unique even integers
        long currentEven = 2;
        
        while (finalSum >= currentEven) {
            result.add(currentEven);
            finalSum -= currentEven;
            currentEven += 2;
        }
        
        // If there's any remaining sum that is valid, add it to the result
        if (finalSum > 0) {
            // Remove the last added even number and adjust the sum
            long removedLast = result.remove(result.size() - 1);
            result.add(removedLast + finalSum);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(sqrt(finalSum))
  - The loop runs until we reach the point where the remaining `finalSum` is less than the next candidate even number to add. This can happen roughly in sqrt(n) steps.

- **Space Complexity:** O(k)
  - The space required is proportional to the number of even integers added to the result list, which can also be expressed as O(sqrt(n)) given the nature of the sum split.

This solution efficiently utilizes the greedy approach to achieve the desired result within optimal time and space constraints.
