[Leetcode 2370. Longest Ideal Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2370)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. A substring is considered **ideal** if for every pair of consecutive characters in the substring, the absolute difference between their ASCII values is at most `k`. Return the length of the longest ideal substring.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can you provide an example of the string and the value of `k`?
   - **A:** Sure. For example, if `s = "acfgbd"` and `k = 2`, the longest ideal subsequence can be `acfg` with a length of 4.

2. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the length of the string `s`?
   - **A:** Yes, typically you can assume the length of `s` is within the range of 1 to 100,000 characters.

3. **Q:** Can the input have non-alphabetic characters?
   - **A:** No, for this problem, assume that `s` will contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - We can use dynamic programming to keep track of the longest ideal subsequence up to each character.
   - We'll maintain an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest ideal subsequence ending at position `i` in the string `s`.
   
2. **Transition Between States:**
   - For every character `s[i]`, we need to look at all previous characters `s[j]` where the absolute difference `|s[i] - s[j]| <= k`.
   - To efficiently find the longest subsequence, we can use a map to store the length of the longest ideal subsequence ending with each character.
   
3. **Updating States:**
   - For each character, we update its respective entry in the map by considering potential previous characters within the ASCII range that comply with the difference constraint.
   
### Code
Here's the implementation of the described strategy:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class LongestIdealSubsequence {
    
    public int longestIdealString(String s, int k) {
        int[] dp = new int[26];
        int result = 0;
        
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            int currentMax = 0;
            for (int diff = -k; diff <= k; diff++) {
                int prevCharIndex = ch - 'a' + diff;
                if (prevCharIndex >= 0 && prevCharIndex < 26) {
                    currentMax = Math.max(currentMax, dp[prevCharIndex]);
                }
            }
            dp[ch - 'a'] = currentMax + 1;
            result = Math.max(result, dp[ch - 'a']);
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LongestIdealSubsequence lis = new LongestIdealSubsequence();
        String s = "acfgbd";
        int k = 2;
        System.out.println(lis.longestIdealString(s, k)); // Output: 4
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n * 2k) where `n` is the length of the string `s` and `2k` is the window of potential character transitions we check for each character. Since `k` is bounded by the character set size (up to 25 for lowercase English letters), the time complexity essentially behaves as O(n).
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) since we only use a fixed array of size 26 (`dp`) to keep track of the current state.

This solution efficiently finds the longest ideal subsequence by dynamically updating possible states and ensuring that we consider necessary transitions governed by the constraint `k`.
