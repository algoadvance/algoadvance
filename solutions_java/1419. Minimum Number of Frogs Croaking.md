[Leetcode 1419. Minimum Number of Frogs Croaking](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1419)
## Problem Statement

You have an array of characters representing frog croaking sounds. Each frog croaks only in the following sequence: `'c' -> 'r' -> 'o' -> 'a' -> 'k'`. To form a complete "croak", each sequence must be contiguous and in order. Multiple frogs can croak simultaneously. 

You need to determine the minimum number of frogs that are simultaneously croaking at any point in time to produce the given sequence. If the string is not valid and cannot be fully croaked by any number of frogs, return `-1`.

**Example:**
```text
Input: croakOfFrogs = "croakcroak"
Output: 1 

Input: croakOfFrogs = "crcoakroak"
Output: 2

Input: croakOfFrogs = "croakcrook"
Output: -1

Input: croakOfFrogs = "croakcroa"
Output: -1
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input string contain characters other than 'c', 'r', 'o', 'a', 'k'?**
   - No, the input string will only contain these 5 characters.

2. **Do we need to handle edge cases explicitly, such as an empty string?**
   - No, the constraint implies the input will be within a valid range for typical problem constraints.

3. **Can we assume the input string is relatively short?**
   - Yes, typically you can expect the length to be within reasonable bounds for such coding problems.

## Strategy

1. **Count Approach:** 
    - Use counters to track the number of each character currently in the sequence.
    - Track the current concurrent croaks by using an additional counter.
  
2. **Validation:**
    - Ensure each character transitions correctly through the sequence. For instance, a 'r' should have a preceding 'c', an 'o' should have a preceding 'r', and so on.
    - If at any point the sequence becomes invalid (such as too many 'r's without corresponding 'o's), return `-1`.

3. **Completion:**
    - Ensure all characters have completed their croak sequences by the end of the string.

## Code

Here is the Java implementation:

```java
class Solution {
    public int minNumberOfFrogs(String croakOfFrogs) {
        int c = 0, r = 0, o = 0, a = 0;
        int frogs = 0, maxFrogs = 0;
        
        for (char ch : croakOfFrogs.toCharArray()) {
            if (ch == 'c') {
                c++;
                frogs++;
                maxFrogs = Math.max(frogs, maxFrogs);
            } else if (ch == 'r') {
                if (c < 1) return -1;
                c--;
                r++;
            } else if (ch == 'o') {
                if (r < 1) return -1;
                r--;
                o++;
            } else if (ch == 'a') {
                if (o < 1) return -1;
                o--;
                a++;
            } else if (ch == 'k') {
                if (a < 1) return -1;
                a--;
                frogs--;
            }
        }
        
        if (c == 0 && r == 0 && o == 0 && a == 0) {
            return maxFrogs;
        } else {
            return -1;
        }
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input string. We make a single pass over the string to count and validate sequences.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` since we use a fixed number of integer counters regardless of the input size.

This approach ensures an efficient and straightforward solution to the problem.
