[Leetcode 2121. Intervals Between Identical Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2121)
### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 2121: Intervals Between Identical Elements

You are given an array of integers `arr`. For each integer in the array, you need to determine the sum of absolute differences between the indices of occurrences of that integer and the index at that position.

For example, if `arr = [1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1]`, the output should be `[5, 3, 3, 3, 0, 4]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the range of possible values in the array?
   - What is the maximum length of the array?

2. **Expected Output**:
   - Should the output be a list of integers where each integer represents the sum of absolute differences for the corresponding index in the input array?
   - How should the result be formatted?

### Code

Here is a Java solution for the problem:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.HashMap;

public class IntervalCalculator {
    public int[] getDistances(int[] arr) {
        HashMap<Integer, List<Integer>> indexMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Step 1: Collect all indices for each unique value
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            indexMap.putIfAbsent(arr[i], new ArrayList<>());
            indexMap.get(arr[i]).add(i);
        }

        int[] result = new int[arr.length];

        // Step 2: Calculate the sum of distances for each value in the array
        for (int key : indexMap.keySet()) {
            List<Integer> indices = indexMap.get(key);
            
            long prefixSum = 0;
            for (int i = 1; i < indices.size(); i++) {
                prefixSum += indices.get(i) - indices.get(0);
            }
            
            int size = indices.size();
            result[indices.get(0)] = (int) prefixSum;
            
            for (int i = 1; i < size; i++) {
                int diff = indices.get(i) - indices.get(i - 1);
                prefixSum = prefixSum - (size - i) * diff + i * diff;
                result[indices.get(i)] = (int) prefixSum;
            }
        }

        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        IntervalCalculator calculator = new IntervalCalculator();
        int[] arr = {1, 3, 1, 3, 2, 1};
        int[] result = calculator.getDistances(arr);
        
        for (int res : result) {
            System.out.print(res + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Index Collection**: First, collect all the indices for each unique element in the array using a `HashMap`.
   
2. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: For each unique element in the map, compute the sum of absolute differences for each position by leveraging prefix sums to efficiently perform the calculations.

### Time Complexity

- **Index Collection**: O(n) — We traverse the entire array once to collect indices.
  
- **Sum of Distances Calculation**: O(n) — For each unique element, we calculate the sum of distances. Overall, since we process each element in the list of indices, this ensures that the total operations are linear concerning the length of the input array.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n), which should be efficient for large input sizes as per typical constraints in LeetCode problems.
