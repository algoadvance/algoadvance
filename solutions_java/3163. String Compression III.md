[Leetcode 3163. String Compression III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3163)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You need to compress the string such that the length of the compressed string is as small as possible after removing exactly `k` characters from the string.

The compression algorithm should be used is a simple run-length encoding:
1. If a character `c` occurs `L` times in a row, it should be represented by "cL" in the compressed form, where `L` is the length of the sequence of `c`. If `L` is 1, it is just "c".

The task is to find the minimum length of the compressed string after removing exactly `k` characters.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Do spaces and special characters count as characters that can be removed, or only alphabetical characters?**
   - Assuming all characters should be considered.
2. **Are we allowed to change the order of characters or only remove them?**
   - Only removals are allowed; the order of characters must stay the same.
3. **Is the input string always valid ASCII?**
   - Yes, the input string is assumed to be valid ASCII characters.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach:** We will use a DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum compressed length of the substring `s[0:i]` after removing `j` characters.
2. **Iterate Through the String:**
   - For each `i` from 0 to `n`, and for each `j` from 0 to `k`, compute `dp[i][j]` by considering removing some characters or compressing the substring.
3. **Run-Length Encoding:**
   - For each character segment, calculate the number of characters in the compressed form and update the DP array accordingly.
4. **Transition:**
   - Transition from previous states by considering all possible ways to remove characters up to `k`.

### Code

Here is the Java implementation of the given strategy:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int getLengthOfOptimalCompression(String s, int k) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[][] dp = new int[n + 1][k + 1];
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= k; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = Integer.MAX_VALUE / 2; // Initialize with a large value
            }
        }
        dp[0][0] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= k; j++) {
                if (j > 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - 1]); // Remove current character
                }
                
                int same = 0, diff = 0 ;
                
                for (int l = i; l <= n; l++) {
                    if (s.charAt(l - 1) == s.charAt(i - 1)) {
                        same++;
                    } else {
                        diff++;
                    }

                    if (j + diff <= k) {
                        dp[l][j + diff] = Math.min(dp[l][j + diff], dp[i - 1][j] + encodeLength(same));
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        int result = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int j = 0; j <= k; j++) {
            result = Math.min(result, dp[n][j]);
        }
        return result;
    }
    
    private int encodeLength(int cnt) {
        if (cnt == 1) return 1;
        return 1 + String.valueOf(cnt).length();
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is `O(n^3)`. Here:
- `O(n)` comes from the outer loop iterating through the string.
- `O(n)` comes from the inner loop iterating through each possible number of characters to delete.
- `O(n)` comes from the innermost loop iterating through substring lengths for each character segment.

Although this might seem high, optimizations and constraints can make it feasible for smaller inputs within typical competitive programming constraints.
