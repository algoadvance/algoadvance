[Leetcode 887. Super Egg Drop](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l887)
### Problem Statement

You are given `K` eggs, and you have access to a building with `N` floors. Your goal is to determine the minimum number of attempts you need in the worst case to find out the highest floor from which an egg can be dropped without breaking.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is breaking the egg a deterministic behavior?**
   - Yes, breaking the egg is deterministic. If an egg breaks at a certain floor, it will always break at that floor and higher floors.

2. **Do we need to minimize the number of attempts only in the worst case?**
   - Yes, we are focused on minimizing the number of attempts in the worst case scenario.

3. **Can eggs be reused if they don't break?**
   - Yes, eggs can be reused if they don't break.

4. **What are the constraints?**
   - `1 <= K <= 100`
   - `1 <= N <= 10,000`

### Strategy

This problem can be solved using dynamic programming combined with a binary search approach to optimize the number of attempts. 

#### Dynamic Programming Approach:

1. **State Representation:**
   - Let `dp[k][n]` be the minimum number of attempts needed with `k` eggs and `n` floors.

2. **Base Cases:**
   - `dp[0][n] = 0` for all `n` because with 0 eggs, we can do nothing.
   - `dp[k][0] = 0` for all `k` because with 0 floors, no trials are needed.
   - `dp[1][n] = n` because with 1 egg, we have to try every floor from the bottom up.
   
3. **Recurrence Relation:**
   - For each cell `dp[k][n]`, we need to consider all possible floors to drop the egg from (1 to n). The worst-case cost will be the maximum of two scenarios:
     1. Egg breaks: We need to solve the problem for `k-1` eggs and `x-1` floors.
     2. Egg doesn't break: We need to solve the problem for `k` eggs and `n-x` floors.
   - Thus, the relation can be summarized as:
     \[
     dp[k][n] = 1 + \min_{1 \le x \le n} (\max(dp[k-1][x-1], dp[k][n-x]))
     \]

4. **Optimization with Binary Search:**
   - Instead of a linear scan for each possible floor `x`, use binary search to find the optimal floor. This helps to reduce the computation complexity.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(K*N*logN)` due to the binary search optimization within the dynamic programming loops.

### Code

Here is the implementation of the above strategy in Java:

```java
public class SuperEggDrop {
    
    public int superEggDrop(int K, int N) {
        // dp[k][n] will hold the minimum number of attempts needed for k eggs and n floors
        int[][] dp = new int[K + 1][N + 1];

        // Initialize base cases
        for (int i = 1; i <= K; i++) {
            dp[i][0] = 0; // 0 floors => 0 attempts
            dp[i][1] = 1; // 1 floor => 1 attempt
        }
        for (int j = 1; j <= N; j++) {
            dp[1][j] = j; // 1 egg => j attempts since we have to do a linear search
        }
        
        for (int k = 2; k <= K; k++) {
            for (int n = 2; n <= N; n++) {
                int low = 1, high = n;
                while (low + 1 < high) {
                    int mid = (low + high) / 2;
                    int breakCount = dp[k-1][mid-1];
                    int notBreakCount = dp[k][n-mid];
                    
                    if (breakCount > notBreakCount) {
                        high = mid;
                    } else {
                        low = mid;
                    }
                }
                dp[k][n] = 1 + Math.min(
                    Math.max(dp[k-1][low-1], dp[k][n-low]),
                    Math.max(dp[k-1][high-1], dp[k][n-high])
                );
            }
        }

        return dp[K][N];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SuperEggDrop solution = new SuperEggDrop();
        System.out.println(solution.superEggDrop(2, 10)); // Output: 4
        System.out.println(solution.superEggDrop(3, 14)); // Output: 4
    }
}
```

In this code:
- `dp[k][n]` represents the minimum number of attempts needed with `k` eggs and `n` floors.
- Binary search is utilized within the nested loops to find the optimal floor to drop the egg from.
