[Leetcode 3108. Minimum Cost Walk in Weighted Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3108)
### Problem Statement

You are given a weighted, directed graph with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`. The graph is represented by a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [from, to, weight]` indicates that there is an edge from node `from` to node `to` with a weight of `weight`.

You are also given two integers, `start` and `end`, representing the starting and ending nodes of the graph.

Your task is to find the minimum cost to walk from the `start` node to the `end` node. If there is no path from `start` to `end`, return `-1`.

**Example:**
```
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0, 1, 1], [1, 2, 2], [0, 3, 4], [3, 4, 5], [4, 2, 1]], start = 0, end = 2
Output: 3
Explanation: The shortest path is 0 -> 1 -> 2 with a total edge weight sum of 1 + 2 = 3.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any negative weights in the graph?**
    - It's assumed that all weights are non-negative, making Dijkstra's algorithm a suitable solution.

2. **Are there any cycles in the graph?**
    - Cycles may exist, but since weights are non-negative, we don't need to worry about cycles affecting the shortest path calculation.

3. **Is the graph connected?**
    - The graph may not be connected. If no path exists from `start` to `end`, the function should return `-1`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm because it efficiently finds the shortest path in a weighted graph with non-negative weights.

1. **Initialize Data Structures**:
    - A min-heap (priority queue) to always process the next closest node.
    - A distance array initialized to infinity for all nodes except the start node.

2. **Processing Nodes**:
    - Continuously extract the node with the minimum distance from the priority queue.
    - For the extracted node, update the distances of its neighbors if a shorter path is found.

3. **Termination**:
    - Stop the algorithm if the end node is reached or if the priority queue is empty.
    - If the distance to the end node is still infinity, return `-1`.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MinimumCostWalk {
    public int minCostToWalk(int n, int[][] edges, int start, int end) {
        // Create an adjacency list
        List<int[]>[] graph = new ArrayList[n];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }
        
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            int from = edge[0];
            int to = edge[1];
            int weight = edge[2];
            graph[from].add(new int[] {to, weight});
        }
        
        // Dijkstra's algorithm
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingInt(a -> a[1]));
        int[] distances = new int[n];
        Arrays.fill(distances, Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        distances[start] = 0;
        pq.offer(new int[] {start, 0});
        
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            int[] current = pq.poll();
            int currNode = current[0];
            int currDist = current[1];
            
            if (currNode == end) {
                return currDist;
            }
            
            if (currDist > distances[currNode]) {
                continue;
            }
            
            for (int[] neighbor : graph[currNode]) {
                int nextNode = neighbor[0];
                int weight = neighbor[1];
                int newDist = currDist + weight;
                if (newDist < distances[nextNode]) {
                    distances[nextNode] = newDist;
                    pq.offer(new int[] {nextNode, newDist});
                }
            }
        }
        
        return distances[end] == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : distances[end];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumCostWalk mcw = new MinimumCostWalk();
        int n = 5;
        int[][] edges = {
            {0, 1, 1},
            {1, 2, 2},
            {0, 3, 4},
            {3, 4, 5},
            {4, 2, 1}
        };
        int start = 0;
        int end = 2;
        System.out.println(mcw.minCostToWalk(n, edges, start, end));  // Output: 3
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(E log V)` where `E` is the number of edges and `V` is the number of vertices. This is due to the priority queue operations.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(V + E)` for the adjacency list, priority queue, and distance array.
