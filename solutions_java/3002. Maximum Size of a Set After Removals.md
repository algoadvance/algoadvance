[Leetcode 3002. Maximum Size of a Set After Removals](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3002)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers. In one move, you can remove any number of elements from `nums` such that the chosen elements are the same. The goal is to maximize the size of the remaining set after performing these operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the size of the array `nums`?**
   - Typically, constraints will be provided in the problem description. For now, we will assume a general input size.

2. **Can the array contain duplicate elements?**
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicates, and that is central to the problem.

3. **What should be returned?**
   - Return the maximum size of the set after removals.

4. **Are there any constraints on the values of the elements in the array?**
   - We assume all elements are positive integers.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to find the frequency of each element in the array and then determine the maximum size of the set after any number of moves where we can remove any number of elements that are the same. 

Here are the steps to achieve the solution:

1. **Count Frequency**: Use a `HashMap` to count the frequency of each element in `nums`.
2. **Determine Maximum Size**: Find the frequency of the most common element (i.e., the element with the highest frequency). The maximum size of the set will be the size of the original array minus this highest frequency.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class MaximumSizeSet {

    public static int maxSizeSetAfterRemovals(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        HashMap<Integer, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();

        // Calculate the frequency of each element in nums
        for (int num : nums) {
            frequencyMap.put(num, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }

        // Find the highest frequency
        int maxFrequency = 0;
        for (int freq : frequencyMap.values()) {
            maxFrequency = Math.max(maxFrequency, freq);
        }

        // Calculate maximum size of set after removals
        int maxSize = nums.length - maxFrequency;

        return maxSize;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3};
        System.out.println(maxSizeSetAfterRemovals(nums)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Frequency Counting**: O(n) where n is the number of elements in `nums`.
- **Finding Maximum Frequency**: O(m) where m is the number of unique elements (which is at most n). 

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, which is efficient for most practical purposes. The space complexity is also **O(n)** due to the storage requirements of the frequency map.

This approach ensures that we can handle larger input sizes efficiently and get the maximum size of the set after the specified removals.
