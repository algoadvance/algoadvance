[Leetcode 3. Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without repeating characters.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the length range of the input string `s`?
     - Typical constraints might range from 0 to 10^5 characters.

2. **Character Set:**
   - What type of characters does the string contain? 
     - Normally, this can be assumed to be standard ASCII characters.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - How should the function behave for empty input strings?
     - Typically, the result should be 0 for an empty string.
   - Should the solution handle large input strings efficiently?
     - Yes, it is expected to handle up to the maximum constraint efficiently.

### Strategy

We'll use the **Sliding Window** technique combined with a **HashMap** to efficiently track the characters and their most recent positions. Here's the plan:

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - An `int` variable `maxLength` for the result.
   - An `int` variable `start` to track the starting index of the current window.
   - A `HashMap<Character, Integer>` to store the most recent position of each character.

2. **Iterate through the String:**
   - For each character in the string, check if it's already in the `HashMap`.
   - If the character is in the `HashMap` and its position is within the current window (`start` to the current index), update `start` to be one more than this position to ensure no duplicates.
   - Update the `HashMap` with the current position of the character.
   - Calculate the length of the current window and update `maxLength` if this window is larger.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public int lengthOfLongestSubstring(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.length() == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        int maxLength = 0;
        int start = 0;
        HashMap<Character, Integer> charIndexMap = new HashMap<>();

        for (int end = 0; end < s.length(); end++) {
            char currentChar = s.charAt(end);

            // If character is in the map and its index is within the current window
            if (charIndexMap.containsKey(currentChar) && charIndexMap.get(currentChar) >= start) {
                start = charIndexMap.get(currentChar) + 1;
            }

            charIndexMap.put(currentChar, end);
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, end - start + 1);
        }

        return maxLength;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();

        // Test cases
        System.out.println(sol.lengthOfLongestSubstring("abcabcbb")); // Output: 3
        System.out.println(sol.lengthOfLongestSubstring("bbbbb"));    // Output: 1
        System.out.println(sol.lengthOfLongestSubstring("pwwkew"));   // Output: 3
        System.out.println(sol.lengthOfLongestSubstring(""));         // Output: 0
        System.out.println(sol.lengthOfLongestSubstring("abcdefg"));  // Output: 7
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string:

- The `HashMap` operations (get and put) both run in constant time, O(1).
- The `for` loop iterates through the string once, making the overall complexity linear.

This approach efficiently finds the length of the longest substring without repeating characters by maintaining a sliding window over the string.
