[Leetcode 2080. Range Frequency Queries](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2080)
### Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed array of integers `arr`, and an array of queries `queries` where `queries[i] = [left_i, right_i, value_i]`. For each query `i`, compute the frequency of `value_i` in the subarray `arr[left_i...right_i]` inclusive. Return an array of integers where the `i-th` integer is the answer to the `i-th` query.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What are the constraints on the size of `arr` and the number of queries?
   - Are the elements of `arr` and `queries` in bounds that we can manage with standard integer operations?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - Should we consider situations where `left_i` or `right_i` are out of bounds?
   - What if `value_i` is not present in the given range?

3. **Output Format:**
   - Should the result be returned as an array of integers?

### Strategy
Given the problem, a direct approach would be too slow if the array or number of queries is large, since counting the frequency for each query individually would result in an \(O(n \times m)\) time complexity (where \(n\) is the length of `arr` and \(m\) is the number of queries).

A more efficient approach would involve preprocessing the array to speed up the queries:
1. **Use a HashMap or TreeMap for Preprocessing:**
   - Traverse the array once and record the positions (indices) of each unique value.
   
2. **Binary Search for Efficient Querying:**
   - For each query, use binary search over the list of positions to count how many of those fall within the given range `[left_i, right_i]`.
   
This approach would reduce the query time significantly after the preprocessing step.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

class RangeFreqQuery {
    private Map<Integer, List<Integer>> valueIndicesMap;
    
    public RangeFreqQuery(int[] arr) {
        valueIndicesMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            valueIndicesMap.computeIfAbsent(arr[i], k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(i);
        }
    }
    
    public int query(int left, int right, int value) {
        if (!valueIndicesMap.containsKey(value)) {
            return 0;
        }
        List<Integer> indices = valueIndicesMap.get(value);
        int leftIndex = findLeftMostIndex(indices, left);
        int rightIndex = findRightMostIndex(indices, right);

        if (leftIndex == -1 || rightIndex == -1 || leftIndex > rightIndex) {
            return 0;
        }

        return (rightIndex - leftIndex + 1);
    }
    
    private int findLeftMostIndex(List<Integer> indices, int target) {
        int lo = 0, hi = indices.size() - 1;
        while (lo <= hi) {
            int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
            if (indices.get(mid) >= target) {
                hi = mid - 1;
            } else {
                lo = mid + 1;
            }
        }
        return lo < indices.size() ? lo : -1;
    }
    
    private int findRightMostIndex(List<Integer> indices, int target) {
        int lo = 0, hi = indices.size() - 1;
        while (lo <= hi) {
            int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
            if (indices.get(mid) <= target) {
                lo = mid + 1;
            } else {
                hi = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return hi >= 0 ? hi : -1;
    }
}

// Example usage:
// int[] arr = {1,3,1,3,2,1,3};
// int[][] queries = // use example above
// RangeFreqQuery obj = new RangeFreqQuery(arr);
// for (int[] query : queries) {
//     System.out.println(obj.query(query[0], query[1], query[2]));
// }
```

### Time Complexity
- **Preprocessing: O(n):** We traverse the array once to fill the `valueIndicesMap`.
- **Query Time (per query): O(log k):** Where `k` is the number of indices stored for the particular `value_i`.

Thus, the preprocessing is linear with respect to the array size, and each query is efficient due to the binary search, making it manageable even for large inputs.
