[Leetcode 930. Binary Subarrays With Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l930)
### Problem Statement
Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `goal`, return the number of non-empty subarrays with a sum equal to `goal`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the `nums` array contain only 0s and 1s?**
   - Yes, the binary array `nums` contains only 0s and 1s.
2. **What are the constraints on the length of `nums`?**
   - The length of `nums` can be between 1 and \(10^5\).
3. **Is the goal always a positive integer?**
   - The goal can be zero or a positive integer.
4. **Can the subarrays overlap?**
   - Yes, subarrays can overlap.

### Strategy
To solve the problem efficiently, we can use the prefix sum and a hashmap (or dictionary) to keep track of the number of times a particular prefix sum occurs. The basic idea is as follows:

1. **Prefix Sum**: Calculate the prefix sum for each element as we iterate through the array. The prefix sum up to the \(i\)-th index is the sum of all elements from the start up to \(i\).
2. **HashMap for Prefix Sum Counts**: Use a hashmap to store the count of each prefix sum encountered. This helps in determining how many times we have seen a particular prefix sum and to find the subarrays with sum equal to the goal.
3. **Count Subarrays**:
    - For each prefix sum encountered, we check if there exists a subarray with the required sum by using the formula `current_prefix_sum - goal`.
    - If `current_prefix_sum - goal` exists in our hashmap, it means there are some subarrays ending at the current index which have their sums equal to `goal`.

### Time Complexity
The above approach works in O(n) time complexity where n is the length of the array. This is because we pass through the array a single time and make hashmap operations which on average take O(1) time.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    public int numSubarraysWithSum(int[] nums, int goal) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> prefixSumCounts = new HashMap<>();
        int currentPrefixSum = 0;
        int countSubarrays = 0;

        // Initial count for prefix sum 0 (prefix sum before starting)
        prefixSumCounts.put(0, 1);

        for (int num : nums) {
            currentPrefixSum += num;

            // Check if there exists prefix sum that can form a subarray with sum = goal
            if (prefixSumCounts.containsKey(currentPrefixSum - goal)) {
                countSubarrays += prefixSumCounts.get(currentPrefixSum - goal);
            }

            // Update the count of the current prefix sum in the map
            prefixSumCounts.put(currentPrefixSum, prefixSumCounts.getOrDefault(currentPrefixSum, 0) + 1);
        }

        return countSubarrays;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {1, 0, 1, 0, 1};
        int goal = 2;
        System.out.println(sol.numSubarraysWithSum(nums, goal)); // Output: 4
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: Start with an empty hashmap to keep track of prefix sums and initialize prefix sum to zero. Add an entry in the hashmap for prefix sum zero with a count of one.
2. **Iterate through array**: For each element, update the current prefix sum.
3. **Check for valid prefix sums**:
    - If the difference between the current prefix sum and the goal (`currentPrefixSum - goal`) is present in the hashmap, it indicates that we have found subarrays that sum to the goal, so we add the count of those prefix sums to our result.
4. **Update hashmap**: Add (or update) the current prefix sum in the hashmap.
5. **Return result**: At the end of the iteration, return the total count of valid subarrays.

### Conclusion
This approach efficiently counts the number of non-empty subarrays with a sum equal to the given goal by leveraging prefix sums and a hashmap to achieve linear time complexity.
