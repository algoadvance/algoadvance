[Leetcode 1749. Maximum Absolute Sum of Any Subarray](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1749)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, you need to find the maximum absolute sum of any (possibly empty) subarray of `nums`. A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1, -3, 2, 3, -4]
Output: 5
Explanation: The subarray [2, 3] has the largest sum 5, and [-3, 2, 3, -4] has the smallest sum -2. The maximum absolute sum is 5 (from subarray [2, 3]).
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [2, -5, 1, -4, 3, -2]
Output: 8
Explanation: The subarray [-5, 1, -4] has the smallest sum -8, and the subarray [3] has the largest sum 3. The maximum absolute sum is 8 (from subarray [-5, 1, -4]).
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input array contain both positive and negative numbers? 
   - Yes.
2. Are all numbers within the range of -10^4 to 10^4 inclusive?
   - Yes.
3. Should the solution handle the case of an empty subarray?
   - Yes, but an empty subarray effectively has a sum of 0, which will not affect the answer in practice since the absolute value of the sum of any non-empty subarray will be maximized.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to find:
1. The maximum possible sum of any subarray.
2. The minimum possible sum of any subarray.
   
The result will be the maximum of the absolute values of these two sums.

We can leverage Kadaneâ€™s algorithm to find the maximum subarray sum efficiently. By modifying it slightly, we can also find the minimum subarray sum.

### Code
Here's the Java implementation:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxAbsoluteSum(int[] nums) {
        int maxSum = 0, minSum = 0;
        int currentMax = 0, currentMin = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            currentMax = Math.max(0, currentMax + num);
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentMax);
            
            currentMin = Math.min(0, currentMin + num);
            minSum = Math.min(minSum, currentMin);
        }

        return Math.max(maxSum, -minSum);
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. Iterate through each element in the array.
2. Maintain two running sums:
   - `currentMax` which tracks the maximum subarray sum ending at the current index.
   - `currentMin` which tracks the minimum subarray sum ending at the current index.
3. Update `maxSum` to be the maximum of `maxSum` and `currentMax`.
4. Update `minSum` to be the minimum of `minSum` and `currentMin`.
5. Finally, return the maximum of `maxSum` and the absolute value of `minSum`.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. This is because we are iterating through the array only once. 
The space complexity is `O(1)` since we are using a constant amount of extra space.
