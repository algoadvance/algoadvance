## Problem Statement

Leetcode 1823: **Find the Winner of the Circular Game**

You are given the integer `n` and an integer `k`. There are `n` people standing in a circle waiting to be executed. The counting out begins at the first position in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a fixed direction (clockwise). In each step, a certain number of people are skipped and the next person is executed. The elimination proceeds around the circle (which is becoming smaller and smaller as people are being executed) until only the last person remains, who is given freedom.

Return the position of the person who is the winner. The position is 1-indexed.

**Example:**
```
Input: n = 5, k = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
The game will get executed as follows:
Start at 1:
1 (skip 1 person) -> 1 is out; Sequence: [2, 3, 4, 5]
2 (skip 1 person) -> 3 is out; Sequence: [2, 4, 5]
4 (skip 1 person) -> 5 is out; Sequence: [2, 4]
2 (skip 1 person) -> 2 is out; Sequence: [4]
4 is the last person standing.
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= k <= n <= 500`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Does the circle start with 1-indexing or 0-indexing internally?
2. Are all the positions unique and continuous from 1 to `n`?

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can utilize the concept from the Josephus problem. The Josephus problem is a theoretical problem related to a certain elimination game.

**Steps:**
1. We can simulate the game using a list to represent the circle and eliminate every k-th person until there is only one left.
2. Alternatively, using mathematical derivation, we can use recursion to find the position of the last person standing.

The recursive solution finds the position of the safe place using the formula:
- `josephus(n, k) = (josephus(n - 1, k) + k) % n`
- Base Case: `josephus(1, k) = 0`

Finally, convert the 0-indexed result to 1-indexed required result.

## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int findTheWinner(int n, int k) {
        return josephus(n, k) + 1;  // +1 because the function josephus is 0-indexed.
    }
    
    private int josephus(int n, int k) {
        if (n == 1) {
            return 0;
        } else {
            return (josephus(n - 1, k) + k) % n;
        }
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the recursive solution is `O(n)` because it has to perform a single recursive call for each `n`, where `n` is the number of people. The space complexity is `O(n)` due to the call stack of the recursion.

This solution is efficient given the constraints (1 <= k <= n <= 500), and it should work within the limits comfortably.
