[Leetcode 1761. Minimum Degree of a Connected Trio in a Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1761)
### Problem Statement
You are given an undirected graph represented by an integer `n` which denotes the number of nodes and an array `edges`, where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` represents an undirected edge between the nodes `ui` and `vi`. A connected trio is a set of three nodes where there is an edge between every pair of the three nodes. The degree of a connected trio is the total number of edges connected to all the nodes in the trio.

Return the minimum degree of a connected trio in the graph, or -1 if the graph has no connected trio.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What should we return if there are no connected trios in the graph?**
   - Return `-1`.

2. **Can the graph contain self-loops or multiple edges between the same pair of nodes?**
   - No. Given the problem constraints, the graph contains only simple edges without self-loops or multiple edges.

3. **What is the range of `n` and the number of edges?**
   - `n` ranges up to 400 and the number of edges can be up to 10,000.

### Strategy
1. **Graph Representation:** Use an adjacency matrix for efficient edge lookups to determine if there is an edge between any two nodes.
2. **Count Degrees:** Create an array to store the degree of each node.
3. **Identify Connected Trios:** Use three nested loops to identify all possible trios of nodes. Check if they form a connected trio by verifying the adjacency matrix.
4. **Calculate Degree of Connected Trio:** For each connected trio, calculate the degree of all three nodes combined and subtract 6 (since each trio fully connected has 3 internal edges).
5. **Track Minimum Degree:** Maintain and update the minimum degree encountered during the above steps.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int minTrioDegree(int n, int[][] edges) {
        boolean[][] adjMatrix = new boolean[n+1][n+1];
        int[] degree = new int[n+1];

        // Construct the adjacency matrix and degree array
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0];
            int v = edge[1];
            adjMatrix[u][v] = true;
            adjMatrix[v][u] = true;
            degree[u]++;
            degree[v]++;
        }

        int minDegree = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        // Check all possible trios
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = i + 1; j <= n; j++) {
                if (adjMatrix[i][j]) {
                    for (int k = j + 1; k <= n; k++) {
                        if (adjMatrix[i][k] && adjMatrix[j][k]) {
                            // Calculate the degree of the trio (i, j, k)
                            int trioDegree = degree[i] + degree[j] + degree[k] - 6;
                            minDegree = Math.min(minDegree, trioDegree);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return minDegree == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : minDegree;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Construction of Adjacency Matrix and Degree Array:** O(E), where E is the number of edges.
- **Iteration through Trios:** O(V^3) where V is the number of nodes.

Given the constraints (n up to 400), this solution should be efficient and feasible.

### Summary
This approach efficiently handles the problem by leveraging an adjacency matrix for quick edge lookups and performing a triple nested loop to cover all potential trios. The degree calculations are straightforward, ensuring the solution meets the problem's requirements.
