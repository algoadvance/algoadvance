[Leetcode 2413. Smallest Even Multiple](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2413)
## Problem Statement

Given a positive integer `n`, return the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both `2` and `n`.

**Example:**
``` 
Input: n = 5
Output: 10
Explanation: The smallest multiple of both 2 and 5 is 10.
```
```
Input: n = 6
Output: 6
Explanation: The smallest multiple of both 2 and 6 is 6 since 6 is already even.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the input value `n`?**
   - The problem states that `n` is a positive integer. To ensure thoroughness, checking the constraints in the problem description would be ideal.

2. **Is there any specific performance requirement or constraints to consider?**
   - Given the nature of the problem, it seems straightforward without stringent performance constraints, but we aim to write an efficient solution.

## Strategy

To find the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both `2` and `n`, we can use the following observations:

1. The smallest positive multiple of `2` and any integer `n` is simply `2 * n` if `n` is odd.
2. If `n` is even, `n` itself is already a multiple of `2`.

Thus, the smallest positive integer that is a multiple of both `2` and `n` can be found using:
- `(2 * n) if (n % 2 != 0)`
- `(n) otherwise`

This leads to a simple conditional check in our implementation.

## Code

```java
public class SmallestEvenMultiple {
    public int smallestEvenMultiple(int n) {
        if (n % 2 == 0) {
            return n;
        } else {
            return 2 * n;
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SmallestEvenMultiple sem = new SmallestEvenMultiple();
        System.out.println(sem.smallestEvenMultiple(5));  // Output: 10
        System.out.println(sem.smallestEvenMultiple(6));  // Output: 6
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(1)** because:
- The operations performed (`n % 2`, `2 * n`) are constant time operations.
- There are no loops or recursive calls, so execution time does not depend on the input size.

## Summary

This solution leverages the properties of even and odd numbers to quickly determine the smallest even multiple of any given integer `n`. It runs in constant time and meets the problem's requirements with minimal computational overhead.
