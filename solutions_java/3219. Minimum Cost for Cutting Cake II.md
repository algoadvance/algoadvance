[Leetcode 3219. Minimum Cost for Cutting Cake II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3219)
### Problem Statement

Given a rectangular cake represented as an `m x n` grid, you need to cut the cake into smaller pieces using an array of horizontal cuts and vertical cuts. Each cut has a cost associated with it, and you need to minimize the cost to get the required pieces. The cost of the cuts is the difference in size of pieces they result into.

### Example:
For instance, if you have a cake of size 4x4 and you need to make cuts at the following:
- Horizontal cuts at [1, 3]
- Vertical cuts at [1, 2, 3]

You need an algorithm that computes the minimum cost of such an operation.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input format**: What is the precise format of the input?
2. **Output format**: What exactly is expected in the output? The minimum cost value?
3. **Are the costs always non-negative?** Are there any constraints on the values in the horizontal and vertical cuts arrays?
4. **Is there any particular order in which I should process the cuts?** This will help in deciding the strategy.
5. **Can cuts overlap or intersect?** 

### Code

Let's assume the given inputs are:
```java
// input: the dimensions of the cake and arrays of horizontal and vertical cuts as well as their respective costs
int m = 4;
int n = 4;
int[] horizontalCuts = {1, 3};
int[] verticalCuts = {1, 2, 3};

// This function returns the minimum cost for cutting the cake
public int minCostCuttingCake(int m, int n, int[] horizontalCuts, int[] verticalCuts) {
    // The actual implementation would go here
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Prepare two lists for storing the horizontal and vertical segments that divides the cake grid.
2. **Sorting**: Sort the horizontal and vertical cuts.
3. **Calculate Segments**: Calculate the segment lengths between consecutive cuts. These lengths represent the cost chunks for the dp matrix.
4. **Dynamic Programming Matrix**: Use dynamic programming to find the minimum cost for making the given cuts. The idea is to move from smaller problems (small segments) to the entire grid.
5. **Combine Results**: The cost of cuts in each segment is added.

We need a DP-matrix approach to minimize the total costs of cuts. The dynamic programming table will keep track of the minimum expenses for each subsection of the slices based on the previously computed results.

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: O(k log k) + O(l log l), where k and l are the lengths of horizontal and vertical cuts arrays.
- **DP matrix setup and computation**: O(m^2 * n^2), as we need to consider every subsection of the cake.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MinimumCostCuttingCake {
    public int minCostCuttingCake(int m, int n, int[] horizontalCuts, int[] verticalCuts) {
        Arrays.sort(horizontalCuts);
        Arrays.sort(verticalCuts);

        // Add the border limits
        int[] hCuts = new int[horizontalCuts.length + 2];
        int[] vCuts = new int[verticalCuts.length + 2];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < horizontalCuts.length; i++) hCuts[i + 1] = horizontalCuts[i];
        for (int i = 0; i < verticalCuts.length; i++) vCuts[i + 1] = verticalCuts[i];
        
        hCuts[horizontalCuts.length + 1] = m;
        vCuts[verticalCuts.length + 1] = n;

        int[][] dp = new int[hCuts.length][vCuts.length];

        for (int i = 1; i < hCuts.length; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j < vCuts.length; j++) {
                int minCost = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
                for (int p = 0; p < i; p++)
                    minCost = Math.min(minCost, dp[p][j] + dp[i - p - 1][j] + (hCuts[i] - hCuts[p]));
                for (int q = 0; q < j; q++)
                    minCost = Math.min(minCost, dp[i][q] + dp[i][j - q - 1] + (vCuts[j] - vCuts[q]));
                dp[i][j] = minCost;
            }
        }

        return dp[hCuts.length - 1][vCuts.length - 1];
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumCostCuttingCake mccc = new MinimumCostCuttingCake();
        int m = 4;
        int n = 4;
        int[] horizontalCuts = {1, 3};
        int[] verticalCuts = {1, 2, 3};
        System.out.println(mccc.minCostCuttingCake(m, n, horizontalCuts, verticalCuts));
    }
}
```

This code might still need adjustment based on exact problem details, constraints, and understanding the costs between cuts effectively. Please adjust based on the specific problem statement and ensure thorough testing for edge cases.

### Time Complexity Summary
- **Sorting**: O((h + v) log (h + v))
- **DP Computation**: O(h \* v\* max(h, v))
