[Leetcode 3114. Latest Time You Can Obtain After Replacing Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3114)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `time` in the form of "HH:MM". Some of the digits are hidden (represented by `?`). The valid times are between `00:00` and `23:59`. Replace the `?` characters with digits (0-9) in such a way that the time represented by the string is the latest valid time possible.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Is there guaranteed to be at least one `?` in the `time` string?
2. Are we always working with 24-hour format time?
3. What should the output be? The fully constructed latest time?

### Code

```java
public class LatestTime {
    public static String getLatestTime(String time) {
        char[] timeChars = time.toCharArray();
        
        // Handle H1 position
        if (timeChars[0] == '?') {
            if (timeChars[1] == '?' || timeChars[1] <= '3') {
                timeChars[0] = '2';
            } else {
                timeChars[0] = '1';
            }
        }
        
        // Handle H2 position
        if (timeChars[1] == '?') {
            if (timeChars[0] == '2') {
                timeChars[1] = '3';
            } else {
                timeChars[1] = '9';
            }
        }
        
        // Handle M1 position
        if (timeChars[3] == '?') {
            timeChars[3] = '5';
        }
        
        // Handle M2 position
        if (timeChars[4] == '?') {
            timeChars[4] = '9';
        }
        
        return new String(timeChars);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test cases
        System.out.println(getLatestTime("2?:?0")); // Expected "23:50"
        System.out.println(getLatestTime("0?:3?")); // Expected "09:39"
        System.out.println(getLatestTime("1?:22")); // Expected "19:22"
        System.out.println(getLatestTime("?4:5?")); // Expected "14:59"
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **First character ('H1') handling:**
    - If `timeChars[0]` is '?', check the next character `timeChars[1]`.
    - If `timeChars[1]` is '?' or it is between '0' and '3', set `timeChars[0]` to '2'.
    - Otherwise, set `timeChars[0]` to '1'.

2. **Second character ('H2') handling:**
    - If `timeChars[1]` is '?', check the first character `timeChars[0]`.
    - If `timeChars[0]` is '2', set `timeChars[1]` to '3' to ensure the highest valid hour (23).
    - Otherwise, set `timeChars[1]` to '9'.

3. **Third character ('M1') handling:**
    - If `timeChars[3]` is '?', set it to '5' because the highest valid minute tens is 5.

4. **Fourth character ('M2') handling:**
    - If `timeChars[4]` is '?', set it to '9' because the highest valid minute ones is 9.

This strategy ensures we replace the '?' characters with digits to get the latest possible time.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(1)** because the operations are constant time checks and replacements based on fixed conditions. The space complexity is also **O(1)** as no extra space proportional to input size is used.
