[Leetcode 1705. Maximum Number of Eaten Apples](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1705)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `apples` and an array `days`. The `apples[i]` represents the number of apples grown on the i-th day that will rot `days[i]` days later. You can eat at most one apple a day. Your task is to determine the maximum number of apples you can eat before they become rotten.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What can be the maximum length of the `apples` and `days` arrays?**
   - As per standard LeetCode constraints, the length can be up to `2 * 10^4`.

2. **Can the values in `apples` be zero?**
   - Yes, `apples[i]` can be zero indicating that no apples grow on the `i-th` day.

3. **Is every element in `days` at least 1?**
   - Yes, each element in `days` is greater than or equal to 1 indicating that apples will certainly rot after at least one day.

4. **What should we do if there are apples left but all future days only have rotten apples?**
   - You can only eat apples on the current or future days if they are not rotten. Once all are rotten, you cannot eat any more apples.

### Strategy

1. **Use a Min-Heap (Priority Queue):**
   - The idea is to always eat the apple that will rot the soonest. We can track the apples by their expiry dates using a priority queue.
   
2. **Daily Process:**
   - For each day, push the current day's apples along with their rotting day into the priority queue.
   - Remove all rotten apples from the heap.
   - Eat one apple from the top of the heap (the apple that rots the soonest).

3. **Post-Iteration:**
   - After iterating through all given days, continue eating available apples in the heap until none can be eaten.

### Time Complexity

- **Insertion and deletion in the priority queue**: Each operation is O(log N).
- Since each apple added is processed once, the overall time complexity will be O(N log N), where N is the length of the input arrays.

### Code

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

class Solution {
    public int eatenApples(int[] apples, int[] days) {
        PriorityQueue<int[]> pq = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]); // [rot day, count of apples]
        int maxApplesEaten = 0;
        int i = 0;
        
        while (i < apples.length || !pq.isEmpty()) {
            // Add the current day's apples to the heap
            if (i < apples.length && apples[i] > 0) {
                pq.offer(new int[] {i + days[i], apples[i]});
            }
            
            // Remove all the apples that are already rotten
            while (!pq.isEmpty() && pq.peek()[0] <= i) {
                pq.poll();
            }
            
            // Eat one apple from the heap (apple that will rot soonest)
            if (!pq.isEmpty()) {
                int[] current = pq.peek();
                if (current[1] > 0) {
                    current[1]--;
                    maxApplesEaten++;
                    if (current[1] == 0) {
                        pq.poll();
                    }
                }
            }
            
            i++;
        }
        
        return maxApplesEaten;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initial Setup:**
   - A priority queue `pq` is used to manage apple batches by their rotting day.
   - `maxApplesEaten` tracks the total apples eaten.
   - `i` is the current day index which incrementally increases.

2. **Daily Routine:**
   - If there are apples harvested on day `i`, we push the apples and their rotting day into the priority queue.
   - We remove any apples whose rotting day is less than or equal to `i` as these have rotted.
   - If there are any apples left in the heap, we eat one and adjust the heap accordingly.

3. **Post Harvesting:**
   - After going through all the given days, we continue to consume the apples left in the heap until all potential apples do not exist.

This approach ensures we efficiently and effectively maximize the number of apples consumed without consuming those that have rotted.
