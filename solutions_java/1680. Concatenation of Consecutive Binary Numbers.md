[Leetcode 1680. Concatenation of Consecutive Binary Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1680)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, return the decimal value of the binary string formed by concatenating the binary representations of `1` to `n` in order, modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of `n`:** What is the maximum value of `n`? (_Answer: According to LeetCode constraints, `n` can go up to 10^5._)
2. **Output format:** Should the output be a single integer? (_Answer: Yes, it is a single integer, which is the decimal value of the concatenated binary string modulo `10^9 + 7`._)
3. **Leading zeros:** Should we consider leading zeros in binary representation? (_Answer: No, standard binary representation does not have leading zeros._)

### Strategy
1. **Binary to Decimal Conversion:** Instead of constructing a large binary string, consider the mathematical properties:
   - Shifting a binary number left by `length` and then adding another number is equivalent to concatenating.
   - The decimal value of the concatenated binary string can be computed iteratively by bit manipulation.
   
2. **Modular Arithmetic:** Since values can get large, use modulo `10^9 + 7` at every stage to prevent overflow.

3. **Bit Length Calculation:** Calculate the bit length of the current integer during iteration to efficiently concatenate without constructing large strings.

### Code Implementation
```java
public class Solution {
    public int concatenatedBinary(int n) {
        final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;
        long result = 0;
        int length = 0; // Length of the current number in binary
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            // If i is a power of 2, increase the bit length
            if ((i & (i - 1)) == 0) {
                length++;
            }
            // Shift the result by the length of the current number and add the current number
            result = ((result << length) | i) % MOD;
        }
        return (int) result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.concatenatedBinary(3)); // Output: 27
        System.out.println(sol.concatenatedBinary(12)); // Output: 505379714
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Loop Runs:** The loop runs from 1 to `n`, thus O(n) iterations.
- **Bit Length Calculation:** Checking if a number is a power of two is O(1) using bitwise operations.
- **Bit Shifting and Addition:** Both left-shift and bitwise OR operations are O(1).

Overall time complexity: **O(n)**

### Conclusion
The provided solution efficiently computes the decimal value of concatenated binary representations for numbers from 1 to `n`, modular `10^9 + 7`, using bitwise operations and modular arithmetic to ensure correctness and performance.
