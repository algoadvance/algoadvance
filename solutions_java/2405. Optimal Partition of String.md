[Leetcode 2405. Optimal Partition of String full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2405)
## Problem Statement

**2405. Optimal Partition of String**

Given a string `s`, partition the string into one or more substrings such that the characters in each substring are unique. Return the minimum number of substrings in such a partition.

**Example:**
```
Input: s = "abac"
Output: 2

Explanation: We can partition the string "abac" into the substrings "a" and "bac". Both substrings have only unique characters.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are spaces and special characters also considered for uniqueness?**
   - Yes, all characters including spaces and special characters should be considered unique within each substring.

2. **What is the length range of the input string `s`?**
   - It is not specified, but typically constraints are reasonable for interview questions. Assume `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`.

3. **Can the input string contain uppercase letters?**
   - The problem statement did not specify, but generally assume strings could have any valid characters unless restricted by the problem constraints.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we will use the following strategy:

1. Traverse the string character by character.
2. Use a `Set` to keep track of characters that are already in the current substring.
3. If a character is not in the `Set`, add it to the `Set`.
4. If a character is encountered that is already in the `Set`:
   - This means we have reached a point where we need to partition the string.
   - Increment the count of partitions.
   - Clear the `Set` and start a new substring by adding the current character to the `Set`.
5. At the end of the traversal, the number of partitions will be our answer.

This approach ensures that each substring has unique characters and we achieve the minimum number of partitions.

## Code

Here is the Java implementation of the above strategy:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;

public class OptimalPartition {
    public int partitionString(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.length() == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int partitions = 1;
        HashSet<Character> uniqueChars = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (uniqueChars.contains(c)) {
                partitions++;
                uniqueChars.clear();
            }
            uniqueChars.add(c);
        }
        
        return partitions;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        OptimalPartition solution = new OptimalPartition();
        System.out.println(solution.partitionString("abac")); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because we traverse every character in the string once.

The space complexity is `O(min(n, k))`, where `k` is the size of the character set (in this case, it is a constant, since there are a limited number of different characters). For English letters, `k` would be 26, so the space complexity is effectively `O(1)`.

This solution is efficient and should work well within the problem constraints.
