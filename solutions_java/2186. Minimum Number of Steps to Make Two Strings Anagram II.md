[Leetcode 2186. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2186)
### Problem Statement
Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the minimum number of steps to make `s` and `t` anagrams of each other. In one step, you can delete exactly one character in either string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What characters are in the strings?**
   - The strings `s` and `t` consist of lowercase English letters.
2. **What are the constraints on the lengths of the strings?**
   - Both `s` and `t` have lengths between 1 and \(10^5\).

### Strategy
1. **Use frequency counts:**
   - We'll count the frequency of each character in both strings using an array of size 26 (since there are 26 lowercase English letters).
2. **Calculate the difference:**
   - For each character from 'a' to 'z', calculate the absolute difference in frequencies between the two strings. This difference represents the number of deletions needed for that character.
3. **Sum the differences:**
   - Sum up all the absolute differences to get the total number of deletions required to make the two strings anagrams.

### Code

Here is the Java code to accomplish the above strategy:

```java
public class MinimumStepsToAnagram {
    public int minSteps(String s, String t) {
        int[] countS = new int[26];
        int[] countT = new int[26];
        
        // Count the frequency of each character in string s
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            countS[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        // Count the frequency of each character in string t
        for (char c : t.toCharArray()) {
            countT[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        int steps = 0;
        
        // Calculate the absolute differences
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            steps += Math.abs(countS[i] - countT[i]);
        }
        
        return steps;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumStepsToAnagram solution = new MinimumStepsToAnagram();
        System.out.println(solution.minSteps("leetcode", "coats"));  // Output: 7
        System.out.println(solution.minSteps("night", "thing"));     // Output: 0
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Counting frequencies:** \( O(n + m) \), where \( n \) is the length of `s` and \( m \) is the length of `t`.
- **Calculating differences:** \( O(1) \) since it involves iterating over a fixed array of size 26.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is **\( O(n + m) \)**.
