[Leetcode 1528. Shuffle String full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1528)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` and an integer array `indices` of the same length. The string `s` will be shuffled such that the character at the `i`th position moves to `indices[i]` in the shuffled string. Return the shuffled string.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "codeleet", indices = [4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3]
Output: "leetcode"
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "abc", indices = [0,1,2]
Output: "abc"
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the length range of the string `s`?**
   - The string length can vary within typical constraints of interview problems (e.g., 1 ≤ `s.length` ≤ 100).

2. **Are all the elements in the `indices` array unique?**
   - Yes, since `indices` is a permutation of the array `0` to `n-1`.

3. **What should be returned if the input string is empty?**
   - Return an empty string if the input string is empty.

### Strategy
1. **Create a character array `shuffled` of the same length as `s`.**
2. **Iterate through the string `s` and place each character to its correct index as specified in the `indices` array.**
3. **Convert the character array `shuffled` back to a string and return it.**

### Code

```java
public class ShuffleString {
    public String restoreString(String s, int[] indices) {
        // Create a character array to hold the shuffled version
        char[] shuffled = new char[s.length()];

        // Iterate over the input string and place each character to its new position
        for (int i = 0; i < s.length(); i++) {
            shuffled[indices[i]] = s.charAt(i);
        }

        // Convert the character array back to a string
        return new String(shuffled);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ShuffleString shuffleString = new ShuffleString();
        System.out.println(shuffleString.restoreString("codeleet", new int[]{4,5,6,7,0,2,1,3})); // Outputs: "leetcode"
        System.out.println(shuffleString.restoreString("abc", new int[]{0,1,2})); // Outputs: "abc"
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. We iterate over the string `s` once to rearrange the characters.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. We use an additional array of the same length as `s` to store the characters in their shuffled positions.

This implementation ensures that the string is shuffled correctly based on the provided `indices` array in linear time, making it efficient for typical input sizes.
