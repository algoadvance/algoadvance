[Leetcode 594. Longest Harmonious Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l594)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest harmonious subsequence among all its possible subsequences.

A harmonious array is an array where the difference between its maximum value and its minimum value is exactly 1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the length limit of the array?**
   - Typically, interview problems handle arrays up to a size of 10^4 to 10^5, but confirming the size can help optimize the solution.
   
2. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - This can affect sorting or hashmap-based solutions.

3. **Are there any constraints on the values that the array can contain?**
   - Knowing the range (e.g., all numbers are within the range of [-10^9, 10^9]) can help in choosing the appropriate data structures.

### Strategy
1. **Use a HashMap to count occurrences of each number**: We will first traverse the array to build a frequency map where the keys are the elements of the array and the values are their counts.
2. **Determine harmonious subsequences**: We'll then iterate through the keys of the hashmap and check for each key if the key + 1 exists. If it does, we sum their counts to determine the length of the harmonious subsequence.
3. **Track the maximum subsequence length**: We continuously update the maximum length found using the approach described above.

This algorithm ensures that we only need to traverse the array a couple of times, making it efficient.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array. Building the frequency map takes O(n) time, and iterating through the keys of the map also takes O(n) time in the worst case.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) due to the space required to store the frequency map.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class LongestHarmoniousSubsequence {
    public int findLHS(int[] nums) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        // Populate the frequency map
        for (int num : nums) {
            frequencyMap.put(num, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        int maxLength = 0;
        
        // Iterate through the map to find the longest harmonious subsequence length
        for (int key : frequencyMap.keySet()) {
            if (frequencyMap.containsKey(key + 1)) {
                int currentLength = frequencyMap.get(key) + frequencyMap.get(key + 1);
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength);
            }
        }
        
        return maxLength;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LongestHarmoniousSubsequence solution = new LongestHarmoniousSubsequence();
        int[] nums = {1, 3, 2, 2, 5, 2, 3, 7};
        System.out.println(solution.findLHS(nums)); // Output: 5
    }
}
```

This code should solve the problem of finding the longest harmonious subsequence in a given array of integers by leveraging a hashmap to store frequencies and then checking adjacent keys to compute possible subsequences' lengths.
