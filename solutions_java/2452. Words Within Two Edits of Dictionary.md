[Leetcode 2452. Words Within Two Edits of Dictionary](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2452)
### Problem Statement:

Given a list of words and a dictionary, return the list of all words that are within at most two edits of the words in the dictionary. An edit is defined as an insertion, deletion, or substitution of a single character.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **What is the maximum length of the words and dictionaries?**
   - This helps to understand potential time complexity constraints.
2. **What should be done if a word in the given list exactly matches a word in the dictionary?**
   - Should it be included in the result list or not?
3. **Can words/dictionary entries be empty?**
   - Edge cases, especially with empty strings, might be handled differently.
4. **Are there any constraints on the characters used in words (e.g., only lowercase letters)?**
   - This helps optimizing different parts of the solution.

For simplicity, I will assume the following:
- Words and dictionary entries consist of lowercase English letters and are bounded by reasonable lengths (e.g., ≤ 100).
- The length of the list of words and the dictionary are also reasonably bounded (e.g., ≤ 10^5).
- If a word in the given list exactly matches a word in the dictionary, it is included in the result list.

### Strategy:

We will use the concept of dynamic programming to calculate the edit distance between words. The edit distance between a given word and dictionary words will be calculated using the Levenshtein distance algorithm. If the calculated distance is less than or equal to 2 for any word in the dictionary, we add that word to the result list.

1. **Implement the `levenshteinDistance` function**:
   - Calculate the edit distance between two words.

2. **Main Functionality**:
   - Iterate over each word in the list of words.
   - For each word, check against each dictionary word using the `levenshteinDistance` function.
   - If the distance is ≤ 2 for any dictionary word, add it to the result list and move to the next word.

### Code:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public List<String> wordsWithinTwoEdits(String[] words, String[] dictionary) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (String word : words) {
            for (String dictWord : dictionary) {
                if (levenshteinDistance(word, dictWord) <= 2) {
                    result.add(word);
                    break;  // No need to check further if this word is already within 2 edits of a dictionary word
                }
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    private int levenshteinDistance(String word1, String word2) {
        int m = word1.length();
        int n = word2.length();
        
        int[][] dp = new int[m + 1][n + 1];
        
        for (int i = 0; i <= m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
                if (i == 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = j;  // If word1 is empty, all characters of word2 need to be inserted
                } else if (j == 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = i;  // If word2 is empty, all characters of word1 need to be deleted
                } else {
                    if (word1.charAt(i - 1) == word2.charAt(j - 1)) {
                        dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
                    } else {
                        dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i - 1][j - 1],  // Substitution
                                            Math.min(dp[i - 1][j],  // Deletion
                                                     dp[i][j - 1])) + 1;  // Insertion
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[m][n];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

1. **Levenshtein Distance Calculation**:
   - Time complexity is \(O(m \times n)\) where \(m\) and \(n\) are the lengths of the two words.

2. **Overall Algorithm**:
   - Let's say the length of `words` array is \(W\) and the length of the `dictionary` array is \(D\), and the maximum length of the words is \(L\).
   - Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(W \times D \times L^2)\), representing the nested loops over words, dictionary, and the calculation of edit distance between each pair.

This time complexity may be acceptable depending on the constraints. If more efficiency is needed, especially for large input sizes, optimizations or heuristic methods could be considered.
