[Leetcode 962. Maximum Width Ramp](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l962)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `A` of integers, a *ramp* is a tuple `(i, j)` for where `i < j` and `A[i] <= A[j]`. The *width* of such a ramp is `j - i`. 

Find the maximum width of a ramp in `A`. If there is no valid ramp, return `0`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume that the array contains at least two elements?
    - Yes, you can assume that.
2. Could the elements of the array be negative integers?
    - Yes, the elements can be negative integers.

### Strategy

1. **Brute Force Approach:**
    - Use two nested loops to iterate over all pairs `(i, j)` and find the maximum width. This approach has \(O(n^2)\) time complexity, which is inefficient for large arrays.

2. **Optimized Approach with Monotonic Stack:**
    - We can use a decreasing monotonic stack to find potential `i` indices where `A[i]` is a candidate for the left end of the ramp.
    - Traverse the array to populate the stack such that it stores indices where the values are in non-increasing order.
    - Traverse the array again from the end to the beginning and find the maximum width by checking against the indices stored in the stack.

3. **Optimized Approach Using Two Pointers:**
    - Create a list of pairs `(index, value)` and sort it based on the values.
    - Use two pointers to find the maximum width while ensuring the order of indices is preserved.
   
We will implement the second optimized approach using a monotonic stack for its balance of a simpler understanding and efficient performance.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Stack;

public class Solution {
    public int maxWidthRamp(int[] A) {
        int n = A.length;
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        
        // Step 1: Populate the monotonic stack with potential left indices
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (stack.isEmpty() || A[stack.peek()] > A[i]) {
                stack.push(i);
            }
        }
        
        int maxWidth = 0;

        // Step 2: Traverse from the end to find the right index
        for (int j = n - 1; j >= 0; --j) {
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && A[stack.peek()] <= A[j]) {
                maxWidth = Math.max(maxWidth, j - stack.pop());
            }
        }
        
        return maxWidth;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
    - The first pass to build the stack is \(O(n)\).
    - The second pass to calculate the maximum width ramp is \(O(n)\).
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
    - The space used by the stack could be \(O(n)\) in the worst case, where every element in the array gets pushed into the stack.

This optimized approach ensures that we can handle large arrays efficiently, achieving the desired linear time complexity.
