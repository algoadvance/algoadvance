[Leetcode 1406. Stone Game III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1406)
### Problem Statement

[1406. Stone Game III](https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-iii/)

Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several stones arranged in a row, and each pile of stones has a positive integer number of stones `piles[i]`. The objective of the game is to obtain the maximum score possible for each player, and a player's score is calculated as the sum of the stones they picked from specific piles.

The game goes as follows:
1. Alice plays first, then they take turns, with Alice and Bob alternating turns.
2. On each player's turn, that player can take 1, 2, or 3 piles of stones from the remaining stones.
3. The game ends when no more piles are available.

The goal is to determine if Alice can be the winner and by what margin she wins or loses.

- If Alice can ensure a winning margin (her score is greater than Bob’s score), then return `"Alice"`.
- If Bob can ensure a winning margin, then return `"Bob"`.
- If the game ends in a draw, then return `"Tie"`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the number of piles or the number of stones in each pile?**
   - Yes, the constraints specify that `n` (the number of piles) will be between `1` and `5 * 10^4` and each pile will have a positive integer between `1` and `10^4` stones.
   
2. **Can the sum of stones in each pile be large enough to overflow standard integer types?**
   - No, Java’s `int` type should be sufficient as `n` and the values in piles are constrained within reasonable limits.
   
3. **Do Alice and Bob always play optimally?**
   - Yes, it is assumed that both players play optimally to maximize their respective scores.

### Strategy

To solve the problem efficiently, we can use **Dynamic Programming**. Here's the strategy:

1. **Define the State:** 
   - `dp[i]` represents the maximum score difference (Alice's score minus Bob's score) obtainable starting from pile `i` to the end of the piles.
   
2. **Recurrence Relation:**
   - Alice has three choices at every stage: take 1, 2, or 3 piles.
   - Consider all these choices and compute the score difference:
     ```java
     dp[i] = max(
                piles[i] - dp[i + 1],
                piles[i] + piles[i + 1] - dp[i + 2],
                piles[i] + piles[i + 1] + piles[i + 2] - dp[i + 3]
              )
     ```

3. **Base Case:**
   - If `i >= n` (beyond the last pile), `dp[i] = 0`.
   
4. **Final Decision:**
   - Evaluate `dp[0]` to determine whether Alice wins, Bob wins, or it’s a tie.

### Time Complexity

- The approach uses dynamic programming with a single pass:
  - **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - **Space Complexity:** O(n) (can be reduced to O(1) using a rolling window as we only use the last three calculated states at each step)

### Implementation

```java
public class Solution {
    public String stoneGameIII(int[] stoneValue) {
        int n = stoneValue.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        
        // Initialize dp with a large negative value for safety
        for (int i = 0; i < n + 1; i++) {
            dp[i] = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
        }
        
        // Base case
        dp[n] = 0;
        
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            int take = 0;
            for (int k = 0; k < 3 && i + k < n; k++) {
                take += stoneValue[i + k];
                dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], take - dp[i + k + 1]);
            }
        }
        
        if (dp[0] > 0) return "Alice";
        if (dp[0] < 0) return "Bob";
        return "Tie";
    }
}
```

### Explanation

- The solution uses a bottom-up dynamic programming approach.
- We start from the end of the `stoneValue` array and work our way backwards, calculating the best possible score difference for each subarray.
- The final result in `dp[0]` tells us the net score difference when both players play optimally from the start.
