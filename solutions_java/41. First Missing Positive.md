[Leetcode 41. First Missing Positive full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l41)
## Problem Statement

Given an unsorted integer array `nums`, return the smallest missing positive integer.

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,2,0]
Output: 3
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [3,4,-1,1]
Output: 2
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: nums = [7,8,9,11,12]
Output: 1
```

### Constraints:

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `-2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Is modifying the input array allowed?
   **A**: Yes, modifying the input array is allowed for optimal space complexity.

2. **Q**: Can the array be empty?
   **A**: According to the constraints, the minimum length of the array is 1, so it can't be empty.

3. **Q**: What should be returned if all the elements in the array are negative?
   **A**: The smallest missing positive integer, which would be `1`.

## Strategy

The optimal solution to this problem is to use a method similar to bucket sort to keep the solution in O(n) time complexity and O(1) additional space complexity. 

### Steps:
1. **Re-positioning**: Put each number `num` in its corresponding index `num - 1` where possible.
2. **Marking**: Iterate over the array again to find out the first position `i` where `nums[i] != i + 1`. This position `i+1` will be the smallest missing positive integer.
3. **Edge Handling**: Consider cases for arrays that are outside the range of 1 to n, where n is the length of the array itself.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int firstMissingPositive(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        
        // Step 1: Place each number in its right place, i.e., nums[i] should be i + 1.
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            while (nums[i] > 0 && nums[i] <= n && nums[nums[i] - 1] != nums[i]) {
                // Swap nums[i] with nums[nums[i] - 1]
                int temp = nums[nums[i] - 1];
                nums[nums[i] - 1] = nums[i];
                nums[i] = temp;
            }
        }
        
        // Step 2: Locate the first missing positive integer
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (nums[i] != i + 1) {
                return i + 1;
            }
        }
        
        // If all positions are correct, the missing number is n + 1.
        return n + 1;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) because:

1. The initial re-positioning of elements in the correct position takes O(n) operations.
2. The final pass to check the first missing positive number also takes O(n) operations.

Since each element is processed at most twice (once in the correct place and once if it needs to be swapped), the overall time complexity remains O(n).

The space complexity is O(1) additional space as the algorithm operates in-place without needing extra structures.
