[Leetcode 1884. Egg Drop With 2 Eggs and N Floors](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1884)
### Problem Statement
You are given 2 eggs and `n` floors. Your task is to determine the minimum number of attempts needed in the worst case scenario to find the highest floor from which an egg can be dropped without breaking. If an egg breaks when dropped from a certain floor, it will break when dropped from any floor higher than that. If an egg does not break, it will not break if dropped from any floor below that.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **When an egg breaks or does not break, can it still be reused in the following trials?**
   - If an egg breaks, it cannot be reused. If it does not break, it can be reused.
2. **Should the solution focus on minimizing the number of drops in the worst-case scenario?**
   - Yes, the solution should aim to minimize the maximum number of drops required in the worst-case scenario.
3. **Is there any specific constraint on the number of floors (n)?**
   - No specific constraints provided. Assume n can be any positive integer.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to employ a dynamic programming approach to minimize the number of trials in the worst-case scenario. The problem can be broken down as follows:

1. **Define the DP table**:
   - `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of attempts needed with `i` eggs and `j` floors.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - `dp[1][j] = j`: With one egg and `j` floors, we need to do a linear search (drop from every floor).
   - `dp[i][0] = 0`: With `i` eggs and 0 floors, no drops are needed.
   - `dp[i][1] = 1`: With `i` eggs and 1 floor, only one drop is needed.

3. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - For each `2 ≤ i ≤ 2` (since we have only 2 eggs) and each `2 ≤ j ≤ n`,
   - Drop an egg from the `k`th floor (where `1 ≤ k ≤ j`):
     - If it breaks, we need `dp[i-1][k-1]` drops to check floors below `k`.
     - If it doesn’t break, we need `dp[i][j-k]` drops to check floors above `k`.
   - Therefore, `dp[i][j] = 1 + min(max(dp[i-1][k-1], dp[i][j-k])) for all 1 ≤ k ≤ j`.

By applying the above strategy, we will populate the dp table and find the minimum attempts required for `2` eggs and `n` floors.

### Code
Here is the Java implementation of the above strategy:

```java
public class EggDrop {
    public int twoEggDrop(int n) {
        int[][] dp = new int[3][n + 1];
        
        // base cases
        for (int j = 0; j <= n; j++) {
            dp[1][j] = j; // with 1 egg and j floors
        }

        for (int i = 2; i <= 2; i++) { // we only need up to 2 eggs
            for (int j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
                for (int k = 1; k <= j; k++) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], 1 + Math.max(dp[i-1][k-1], dp[i][j-k]));
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[2][n];
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        EggDrop solution = new EggDrop();
        int n = 10; // example number of floors
        System.out.println("Minimum number of attempts: " + solution.twoEggDrop(n));
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(K * N^2)\), where \(K\) (number of eggs) is 2 and \(N\) (number of floors) can be any positive integer. This complexity arises because for every floor `j` for every egg `i`, we iterate through every possible floor `k` to find the optimal solution.

However, since \(K\) is a very small constant (2 in this case), the primary complexity to consider is the \(N^2\) term. Therefore, the overall time complexity can be considered as \(O(N^2)\).
