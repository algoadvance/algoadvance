[Leetcode 1971. Find if Path Exists in Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1971)
## Problem Statement

You are given an undirected graph of `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and an integer `n` representing the number of nodes. You are also given a 2D array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes `a_i` and `b_i`. Given two integers `source` and `destination`, return `true` if there is a valid path from `source` to `destination`, or `false` otherwise.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Graph Characteristics**: Are there any self-loops or parallel edges allowed?
    - Typically, no self-loops or parallel edges are allowed unless explicitly mentioned.
    
2. **Input Constraints**:
    - Number of nodes, `n`, `1 <= n <= 200000`.
    - The number of edges, `edges.length`, `0 <= edges.length <= 200000`.
    - Node labels `edges[i][0]` and `edges[i][1]` will fall within `[0, n-1]`.

3. **Special Cases**:
    - If `source` is the same as `destination`, should we return `true`? Yes.
    - What should be returned if there are no edges in the graph and `source` is not equal to `destination`? `false`.

## Strategy

1. **Graph Representation**: Use an adjacency list to represent the graph.
2. **Traversal Technique**: Utilize Breadth-First Search (BFS) for traversal because it helps in finding the shortest path in terms of edges, but Depth-First Search (DFS) is also suitable for this problem.
3. **Visited Set**: Maintain a set of visited nodes to avoid cycles and redundant checks.

## Code

Here's the Java code to solve the problem:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public boolean validPath(int n, int[][] edges, int source, int destination) {
        if (source == destination) {
            return true;
        }
        
        // Create an adjacency list
        List<List<Integer>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            graph.get(edge[0]).add(edge[1]);
            graph.get(edge[1]).add(edge[0]);
        }
        
        // Implement BFS
        Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        Set<Integer> visited = new HashSet<>();
        
        queue.offer(source);
        visited.add(source);
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int currentNode = queue.poll();
            
            for (int neighbor : graph.get(currentNode)) {
                if (neighbor == destination) {
                    return true;
                }
                
                if (!visited.contains(neighbor)) {
                    visited.add(neighbor);
                    queue.offer(neighbor);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Graph Construction**: `O(V + E)` where `V` is the number of vertices (`n`) and `E` is the number of edges.
2. **Graph Traversal**: `O(V + E)` since each node and edge is processed once in BFS.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(V + E)`, making this approach efficient for the given constraints.
