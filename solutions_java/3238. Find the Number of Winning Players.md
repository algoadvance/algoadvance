## Problem Statement

**LeetCode Problem 3238: Find the Number of Winning Players**

Given an integer array `scores` that represents the scores of players in a competition, you are asked to determine the number of winning players.

A player is considered winning if their score is strictly greater than the average score of all players.

Return the count of winning players.

### Example:
```
Input: scores = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
Output: 2
Explanation: The average score is 3, and the players with scores 4 and 5 are the winning players.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What is the range of the integers in the `scores` array?
   - **A:** The integers are likely to be within a typical competitive range, possibly from 0 to 100.

2. **Q:** Can the `scores` array be empty?
   - **A:** No, the constraints will clarify that the array always contains at least one element.

3. **Q:** Can the scores be negative?
   - **A:** Unlikely, given the context of the problem is a competition. Assume scores are non-negative.

4. **Q:** What is the expected time complexity?
   - **A:** Given that calculating the average and comparing values are the primary operations, a linear time complexity, O(n), is expected to be efficient and sufficient.

## Strategy

The core steps to solving this problem are:
1. Calculate the average score of all players.
2. Iterate through the `scores` array and count the number of players whose scores are strictly greater than the calculated average.

### Steps:

1. **Calculate the Average Score:**
   - Sum all the elements in the `scores` array.
   - Divide the sum by the number of elements.

2. **Count the Winning Players:**
   - Iterate through the `scores` array.
   - For each score, check if it is greater than the calculated average.
   - Increment a counter each time the condition is met.

## Code

```java
public class NumberOfWinningPlayers {
    public int findWinningPlayers(int[] scores) {
        if (scores == null || scores.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Calculate the average score
        double sum = 0;
        for (int score : scores) {
            sum += score;
        }
        double average = sum / scores.length;

        // Count the number of players with scores greater than the average
        int winningPlayersCount = 0;
        for (int score : scores) {
            if (score > average) {
                winningPlayersCount++;
            }
        }

        return winningPlayersCount;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NumberOfWinningPlayers solution = new NumberOfWinningPlayers();
        int[] scores = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        System.out.println(solution.findWinningPlayers(scores)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the `scores` array. Here's why:
1. **Sum Calculation:** We iterate through the array once to calculate the sum.
2. **Count Calculation:** We iterate through the array a second time to count the number of winning players.
Thus, the linear time complexity, O(n), ensures efficiency even for large input sizes.
