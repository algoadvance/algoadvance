[Leetcode 1530. Number of Good Leaf Nodes Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1530)
### Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree and an integer `distance`, return the number of good leaf node pairs in the tree.

A good leaf node pair `(A, B)` is if the shortest path between them is less than or equal to `distance`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the definition of a leaf node?**
   - A leaf node is a node with no children.

2. **What is the expected input size?**
   - You can typically expect the number of nodes to be in the range of \( [1, 10^4] \).

3. **Are the node values unique?**
   - The problem does not mention anything about values being unique, and it should not affect the solution.

4. **Can the distance be zero or negative?**
   - For meaningful results, the distance should be positive. A distance of zero would trivially result in zero pairs, as two distinct leaf nodes cannot have zero distance between them.

### Strategy

1. **Recursive Tree Traversal:**
   - We will need to traverse the tree to gather information about leaf nodes and their distances from each node.
  
2. **Post-order Traversal:**
   - We will use post-order traversal (left-right-root) to process nodes starting from the leaves.

3. **Distance Calculation:**
   - While processing each node, for every pair of leaf nodes in the left and right subtree, we will check if the sum of their distances is \(\leq\) `distance`.

4. **Combine Results:**
   - For each non-leaf node, combine the distances from leaf nodes for further processing up the tree.

5. **Use of Helper Method:**
   - A helper method that returns an array where the index represents the distance from the current node to a leaf node and the value represents the number of such leaf nodes.

### Code

```java
class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

public class Solution {

    public int countPairs(TreeNode root, int distance) {
        int[] result = new int[1];
        countPairsHelper(root, distance, result);
        return result[0];
    }

    private int[] countPairsHelper(TreeNode node, int distance, int[] result) {
        if (node == null) return new int[distance + 1];

        if (node.left == null && node.right == null) {
            int[] leaves = new int[distance + 1];
            leaves[1] = 1;
            return leaves;
        }

        int[] leftCount = countPairsHelper(node.left, distance, result);
        int[] rightCount = countPairsHelper(node.right, distance, result);

        for (int i = 1; i <= distance; i++) {
            for (int j = 1; j <= distance - i; j++) {
                result[0] += leftCount[i] * rightCount[j];
            }
        }

        int[] newCount = new int[distance + 1];
        for (int i = 2; i <= distance; i++) {
            newCount[i] = leftCount[i - 1] + rightCount[i - 1];
        }
        return newCount;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Traversal:**
  - We process each node exactly once, so the traversal of the tree will be \( O(N) \) where \( N \) is the number of nodes in the tree.
  
- **Distance Calculation:**
  - For each node, in the worst case, we might need to compare `distance * distance` pairs of leaf nodes which simplifies to \( O(D^2) \) where \( D \) is the maximum distance allowed.

- **Total Complexity:**
  - Since each node's processing involves \( O(D^2) \) operations and we traverse `N` nodes, the overall complexity will be \( O(N \cdot D^2) \).

### Space Complexity

- The recursion call stack will be \( O(H) \) where \( H \) is the height of the tree.

- We also use arrays of size \( distance + 1 \) for each recursive call, leading to additional space complexity.

Hence, the overall space complexity is \( O(H + D) \).
