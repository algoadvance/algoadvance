[Leetcode 2145. Count the Hidden Sequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2145)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `differences` and two integers `lower` and `upper`, you need to determine the number of valid sequences that can be constructed. A sequence is considered valid if:

1. It starts from an integer `start` such that all values of the sequence are within the range `[lower, upper]`.
2. The sequence is constructed using the differences array, meaning if `sequence[i]` is the ith element of the sequence, then `sequence[i+1] = sequence[i] + differences[i]`.

Return the number of valid sequences that can be formed.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the differences array be empty?
   - It is generally assumed that the differences array can be non-empty, as empty sequences do not provide any meaningful processing context.
2. What is the valid range for the integers in the differences array?
   - The differences array can contain both positive and negative integers.
3. Are there constraints on the length of the `differences` array or the value of `lower` and `upper`?
   - Typical constraints are expected: ranges for the array's length and values could be within general acceptable limits for such problems, if not specified.

## Strategy

1. **Understanding Sequence Generation**:
   - Starting with a `start` value, the sequence can be generated as `start`, `start + differences[0]`, `start + differences[0] + differences[1]`, and so on.
   - The requirement is to maintain all these elements within `[lower, upper]`.

2. **Tracking Min and Max Values**:
   - As you generate elements of the sequence, track the cumulative sum.
   - Maintain the minimum and maximum of the cumulative sum observed.
   
3. **Range Check**:
   - For any potential `start` value, the resulting sequence must fit entirely within `[lower, upper]`.
   - This imposes conditions on the possible range of values `start` can assume, i.e., `[start + minCumulativeSum, start + maxCumulativeSum]` must be within `[lower, upper]`.

4. **Calculating Valid Start Ranges**:
   - Calculate the valid range for `start` by ensuring the sequence stays within the bounds.
   - Compute the length of the range of valid `start` values, if possible.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int countValidSequences(int[] differences, int lower, int upper) {
        long minSum = 0;
        long maxSum = 0;
        long cumulativeSum = 0;
        
        for (int diff : differences) {
            cumulativeSum += diff;
            minSum = Math.min(minSum, cumulativeSum);
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, cumulativeSum);
        }
        
        long validStartMin = lower - minSum;
        long validStartMax = upper - maxSum;
        
        if (validStartMax < validStartMin) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        return (int) (validStartMax - validStartMin + 1);
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **O(n)**: The solution involves iterating through the differences array once to compute the cumulative sum details, making the algorithm linear with respect to the length of `differences`.
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)**: Only a fixed amount of additional space is used for calculations, independent of the input size.

This provides an efficient and direct approach to solving the problem using array traversal and range analysis.
