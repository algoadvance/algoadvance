[Leetcode 2781. Length of the Longest Valid Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2781)
### Problem Statement
You are provided with a string `word` and a list `forbidden` containing forbidden substrings. Your task is to find the length of the longest valid substring of `word` that does not contain any of the forbidden substrings.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are there any constraints on the length of the `word` and `forbidden` list?**
   - Assume the maximum length of `word` is 10^4 and the forbidden list might contain up to 10^3 substrings each with a maximum length of 10.

2. **Can the forbidden list contain overlapping substrings?**
   - Yes, the list may contain overlapping substrings.

3. **What should be returned if `word` does not contain any valid substrings?**
   - Return 0 in such a case.

### Strategy
1. **Sliding Window Approach**:
   - Use a sliding window to traverse each possible substring of `word`.
   - Expand the window as long as the current substring does not contain any forbidden substring.
   - If a forbidden substring is encountered within the window, shrink the window from the left until it becomes valid again.
   - Maintain the maximum length of the valid substring found during this process.

2. **Efficiency Considerations**:
   - Use a HashSet to store forbidden substrings for quick look-up.
   - Check for forbidden substrings within the current window to ensure efficiency.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class Solution {
    public int longestValidSubstring(String word, List<String> forbidden) {
        Set<String> forbiddenSet = new HashSet<>(forbidden);
        int maxLength = 0;
        int left = 0;
        
        for (int right = 0; right < word.length(); right++) {
            boolean foundForbidden = false;
            for (int k = 1; k <= 10 && right - k + 1 >= left; k++) {
                if (forbiddenSet.contains(word.substring(right - k + 1, right + 1))) {
                    foundForbidden = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (foundForbidden) {
                left++;
            } else {
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
            }
        }
        return maxLength;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Constructing the `forbiddenSet` takes O(f) time, where `f` is the number of forbidden substrings.
  - The outer loop runs `n` times (where `n` is the length of the word).
  - For each position of the right pointer (n iterations), we iterate at most 10 times to check substrings (`k` in worst-case absence of forbidden substrings).
  - Therefore, the total time complexity is approximately O(n * 10 + f) = O(n + f).

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space complexity for the HashSet containing forbidden substrings is O(f).
  - So the overall space complexity is O(f).
