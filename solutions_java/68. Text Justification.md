[Leetcode 68. Text Justification](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l68)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of strings `words` and a width `maxWidth`, format the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully (left and right) justified.

You should pack your words in a greedy approach; that is, pack as many words as you can in each line. Pad extra spaces ' ' when necessary so that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line do not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will get more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left-justified and no extra space is inserted between words.

**Note:**
* A word is defined as a character sequence consisting of non-space characters only.
* Each word's length is guaranteed to be greater than 0 and not exceed maxWidth.
* The input array words contains at least one word.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the input array of words guaranteed to have at least one word?**
   - Yes, according to the problem statement.

2. **What type of characters can the words contain?**
   - Words are made up of only non-space characters.

3. **How should the extra spaces be distributed in each line?**
   - The extra spaces should be distributed as evenly as possible. If they can't be split evenly, the extra spaces should be placed as left as possible.

4. **How should the last line be formatted?**
   - The last line should be left-justified with the remaining spaces filled with spaces on the right side.

### Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class TextJustification {
    public List<String> fullJustify(String[] words, int maxWidth) {
        List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
        int index = 0;
        
        while (index < words.length) {
            int totalChars = words[index].length();
            int last = index + 1;
            
            while (last < words.length) {
                if (totalChars + 1 + words[last].length() > maxWidth) break;
                
                totalChars += 1 + words[last].length();
                last++;
            }
            
            StringBuilder line = new StringBuilder();
            int numberOfWordsInCurrentLine = last - index;
            if (last == words.length || numberOfWordsInCurrentLine == 1) {
                for (int i = index; i < last; i++) {
                    line.append(words[i]);
                    if (i != last - 1) line.append(" ");
                }
                while (line.length() < maxWidth) {
                    line.append(" ");
                }
            } else {
                int totalSpaces = maxWidth - totalChars + (numberOfWordsInCurrentLine - 1);
                int spacesBetweenWords = totalSpaces / (numberOfWordsInCurrentLine - 1);
                int extraSpaces = totalSpaces % (numberOfWordsInCurrentLine - 1);
                
                for (int i = index; i < last; i++) {
                    line.append(words[i]);
                    if (i != last - 1) {
                        int spacesToApply = spacesBetweenWords + (i - index < extraSpaces ? 1 : 0);
                        for (int j = 0; j < spacesToApply; j++) {
                            line.append(" ");
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
            
            result.add(line.toString());
            index = last;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TextJustification tj = new TextJustification();
        String[] words = {"This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."};
        int maxWidth = 16;

        List<String> justifiedText = tj.fullJustify(words, maxWidth);
        for (String line : justifiedText) {
            System.out.println("\"" + line + "\"");
        }
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialize**: Start with an empty list of strings `result` and an `index` to keep track of the current position in the `words` array.
2. **Line Construction**:
   - For each line, use a greedy approach to add as many words as possible without exceeding `maxWidth`.
   - Calculate the total number of characters and spaces needed for the current line.
3. **Space Distribution**:
   - If the current line is the last line or contains only one word, left-justify it.
   - Otherwise, distribute spaces evenly, adding any extra spaces to the earlier slots.
4. **Add the formatted line** to the `result` list.
5. **Update the index** to start constructing the next line.
6. **Return the result** list.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the total number of characters in the input list of words. This is because each word is processed once, and space distribution is done in constant time per line.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for storing the words and the result list.
