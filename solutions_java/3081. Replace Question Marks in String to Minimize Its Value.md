[Leetcode 3081. Replace Question Marks in String to Minimize Its Value](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3081)
## Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` consisting of digit characters and question mark '?' characters. You need to replace each '?' character with a digit between `0` to `9` such that the resulting string has the minimum possible numeric value.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Is `s` non-empty and will it always contain at least one question mark?**
   - Assume `s` is non-empty and will always contain at least one question mark.
2. **Are there any leading zeros that we need to be concerned about in forming the number?**
   - No, leading zeros are acceptable unless the string is of length 1.
3. **Should multi-digit replacements aim to avoid large value increases, like changing from `999` to `1000`?**
   - Yes, we wish to minimize the entire numerical value, maintaining the smallest possible result after replacements.

## Strategy
1. Initialize a variable to build the new string.
2. Traverse each character of the string `s`:
   - If the character is a '?', replace it with the smallest digit `0`.
   - Else, retain the character as it is.
3. This straightforward replacement ensures the minimized numeric value as all '?' are replaced with `0`.

## Code

```java
public class MinimizeStringValue {
    public static String minimizeValue(String s) {
        StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
        
        for(char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if(c == '?') {
                result.append('0');
            } else {
                result.append(c);
            }
        }
        
        return result.toString();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Sample test cases
        System.out.println(minimizeValue("1?3?5")); // Should print "10305"
        System.out.println(minimizeValue("?")); // Should print "0"
        System.out.println(minimizeValue("??")); // Should print "00"
        System.out.println(minimizeValue("123")); // Should print "123", no change since no '?'
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the given solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because we examine and process each character exactly once in a single pass through the string.
