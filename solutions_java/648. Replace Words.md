[Leetcode 648. Replace Words full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l648)
### Problem Statement

You are given a dictionary consisting of many roots and a sentence. You need to replace all the successors in the sentence with the root forming it. If a successor can be replaced by more than one root, replace it with the root with the shortest length.

#### Example:
1. Input: 
   - `dictionary = ["cat","bat","rat"]`
   - `sentence = "the cattle was rattled by the battery"`
   - Output: `"the cat was rat by the bat"`
   
2. Input:
   - `dictionary = ["a", "b", "c"]`
   - `sentence = "aadsfasf absbs bbab cadsfafs"`
   - Output: `"a a b c"`
   
3. Input:
   - `dictionary = ["a", "aa", "aaa", "aaaa"]`
   - `sentence = "a aa a aaaa aaa aaa aaa aaaaaa bbb baba ababa"`

   - Output: `"a a a a a a a a bbb baba a"`

### Clarifying Questions

1. What are the constraints on the lengths of the dictionary and sentence?
2. Can the dictionary contain duplicate roots?
3. How should we handle punctuation and capitalization?

### Strategy

1. **Trie Construction**:
   - A Trie (Prefix Tree) is an efficient structure to store the dictionary roots and quickly match prefixes of words in the sentence.

2. **Replacing Process**:
   - For each word in the sentence, attempt to find the shortest root from the dictionary using the Trie.
   - Replace with the root if a match is found; otherwise, keep the original word.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Construct a Trie with all roots from the dictionary.
   - Split the sentence into words.
   - For each word in the sentence, find its root using the Trie.
   - Replace the word with its root if found, otherwise leave it as is.
   - Join the words back into a sentence.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    // Trie Node
    class TrieNode {
        Map<Character, TrieNode> children;
        boolean isEndOfWord;
        
        public TrieNode() {
            children = new HashMap<>();
            isEndOfWord = false;
        }
    }
    
    private TrieNode root;
    
    // Initialize the Trie
    public Solution() {
        root = new TrieNode();
    }
    
    // Insert a word into the Trie
    private void insert(String word) {
        TrieNode current = root;
        for (char ch : word.toCharArray()) {
            current.children.putIfAbsent(ch, new TrieNode());
            current = current.children.get(ch);
        }
        current.isEndOfWord = true;
    }
    
    // Search for the shortest root in the Trie
    private String searchRoot(String word) {
        TrieNode current = root;
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        for (char ch : word.toCharArray()) {
            if (!current.children.containsKey(ch)) break;
            sb.append(ch);
            current = current.children.get(ch);
            if (current.isEndOfWord) return sb.toString();
        }
        return word;
    }
    
    public String replaceWords(List<String> dictionary, String sentence) {
        // Insert all dictionary roots into the Trie
        for (String root : dictionary) {
            insert(root);
        }
        
        // Split the sentence into words
        String[] words = sentence.split(" ");

        // Build the replaced sentence
        StringBuilder replacedSentence = new StringBuilder();
        for (String word : words) {
            if (replacedSentence.length() > 0) replacedSentence.append(" ");
            replacedSentence.append(searchRoot(word));
        }
        
        return replacedSentence.toString();
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Trie Construction**: O(M * N), where M is the number of words in the dictionary and N is the average length of each word.
2. **Replacement Process**: O(L), where L is the total number of characters in the sentence.
3. **Overall**: The combined time complexity is O(M * N + L), which is efficient for typical use cases of this problem.

This implementation allows for efficient querying and replacement of words in the sentence using the provided dictionary.
