[Leetcode 2718. Sum of Matrix After Queries](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2718)
## Problem Statement

You are given two integers `n` and `k` and a 2D matrix `matrix` of size `n x n` initialized with all zeros. You also have a list of `k` queries. Each query is represented as a list `[type, index, value]`:
- If `type` is `0`, you need to add `value` to every element in the row with index `index`.
- If `type` is `1`, you need to add `value` to every element in the column with index `index`.

Return the sum of the matrix after all queries are processed.

## Clarifying Questions

Before moving forward, let's clarify a few points to ensure we understand the problem correctly:

1. **Range of Inputs**: What is the maximum possible size of `n` and `k`?
2. **Values in Queries**: Could the `value` in the queries be negative?
3. **Multiple Queries on Same Row/Column**: Should we consider the accumulation of multiple queries on the same row/column?
4. **Efficiency**: Are there any specific constraints or expectations regarding the time and space complexity?

## Strategy

To efficiently solve the problem, we need to track the cumulative sum operations applied to each row and each column without explicitly updating the matrix after each query:

1. **Initialization**: Initialize arrays to track the cumulative sums of rows and columns.
2. **Processing Queries**: Process each query one by one, updating the row or column sum arrays accordingly.
3. **Final Matrix Calculation**: Calculate the sum of the matrix based on the cumulative sums tracked in the arrays.

## Time Complexity

Given the need to process each query individually and finally compute the matrix sum based on the cumulative changes, our approach has an overall time complexity of:
- **O(n + k)** for processing the queries.
- **O(n^2)** for calculating the final sum of the matrix.

Combining these, our overall time complexity is O(n^2 + k), which should be efficient for typical constraints found in interview problems.

## Code

Here's the solution implemented in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public long matrixSumQueries(int n, int[][] queries) {
        long[] rowSum = new long[n];
        long[] colSum = new long[n];
        
        for (int[] query : queries) {
            int type = query[0];
            int index = query[1];
            int value = query[2];
            
            if (type == 0) {
                rowSum[index] += value;
            } else {
                colSum[index] += value;
            }
        }
        
        long matrixSum = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                matrixSum += rowSum[i] + colSum[j];
            }
        }
        
        return matrixSum;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialize `rowSum` and `colSum` Arrays**: These arrays will keep track of the cumulative sum added to each row and column, respectively.
2. **Process each Query**: Based on the type of the query (row or column operation), update the corresponding array.
3. **Calculate the Matrix Sum**: Construct the matrix sum by adding the cumulative sums of the respective rows and columns.

This solution avoids directly manipulating the matrix for each query, making it efficient even for larger values of `n` and `k`.
