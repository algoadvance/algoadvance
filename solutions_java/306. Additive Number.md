[Leetcode 306. Additive Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l306)
### Problem Statement
An **additive number** is a string whose digits can form an additive sequence. A valid **additive sequence** should contain at least three numbers. Except for the first two numbers, each subsequent number in the sequence must be the sum of the preceding two.

Given a string containing only digits, return `true` if it is an additive number or `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: "112358"
Output: true
Explanation: The digits can form an additive sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8.
             1 + 1 = 2, 1 + 2 = 3, 2 + 3 = 5, 3 + 5 = 8
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: "199100199"
Output: true
Explanation: The additive sequence is: 1, 99, 100, 199.
             1 + 99 = 100, 99 + 100 = 199
```

**Constraints:**
- Length of given string is between 1 and 35.
- The string contains only digits (0-9).

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the sequence start with `0`?** 
    - Yes, but if a number starts with `0`, it should be exactly `0` because we don't want leading zeroes in any part of the sequence.
2. **Can the input be empty?**
    - No, per constraints, the length is between 1 and 35.

### Strategy
1. **Iterate through possible first and second numbers:**
   - Use two nested loops to determine the first and second numbers in the sequence.
   - Ensure numbers don't have leading zeros unless they are exactly `0`.
  
2. **Formulate the additive sequence:**
   - Once you identify the first and second numbers, use a loop to generate subsequent numbers.
   - Check if the substring of the sum matches the actual numbers in the original string.
  
3. **Early termination:** 
   - If a sequence fails to match at any point, terminate early.

### Code
Here's the implementation of the described strategy:

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean isAdditiveNumber(String num) {
        int n = num.length();
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n / 2; i++) {
            if (num.charAt(0) == '0' && i > 1) return false; // Leading zero case
            Long num1 = Long.parseLong(num.substring(0, i));
            
            for (int j = i + 1; n - j >= j - i && n - j >= i; j++) {
                if (num.charAt(i) == '0' && j - i > 1) break; // Leading zero case
                Long num2 = Long.parseLong(num.substring(i, j));
                if (isValid(num, num1, num2, j)) return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    private boolean isValid(String num, Long num1, Long num2, int start) {
        int n = num.length();
        while (start < n) {
            num2 = num2 + num1;
            num1 = num2 - num1;
            String sumStr = num2.toString();
            if (!num.startsWith(sumStr, start)) return false;
            start += sumStr.length();
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.isAdditiveNumber("112358")); // true
        System.out.println(solution.isAdditiveNumber("199100199")); // true
        System.out.println(solution.isAdditiveNumber("123")); // true
        System.out.println(solution.isAdditiveNumber("1023")); // false
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is O(n^3), where n is the length of the number string. This is because we have two nested loops, and inside those loops, we validate the sequence which can take up to O(n) time in the worst case.
