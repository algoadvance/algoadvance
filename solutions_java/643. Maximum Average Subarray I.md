[Leetcode 643. Maximum Average Subarray I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l643)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` consisting of `n` elements, and an integer `k`.

Find a contiguous subarray whose length is equal to `k` that has the maximum average value and return this value. Any answer with a calculation error less than `10^-5` will be accepted.

### Example:

1. Input: `nums = [1,12,-5,-6,50,3]`, `k = 4`
   Output: `12.75`
   Explanation: Maximum average is (12-5-6+50)/4 = 51/4 = 12.75

2. Input: `nums = [5,5,5,5]`, `k = 2`
   Output: `5.0`

### Constraints:

- `n == nums.length`
- `1 <= k <= n <= 10^5`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the length of `nums` be less than `k`?
   
   **A:** No, the problem constraints guarantee that `1 <= k <= n`.

2. **Q:** Can the elements be negative?
   
   **A:** Yes, elements can be between `-10^4` and `10^4`.

3. **Q:** How precise does the output value need to be?
   
   **A:** The calculation error should be less than `10^-5`.

## Strategy

To solve the problem efficiently, we will use the sliding window technique. The process involves:

1. Initially calculating the sum of the first `k` elements.
2. Using a sliding window to move through the array while updating the sum by adding the next element and subtracting the element thatâ€™s left behind.
3. Keep track of the maximum sum encountered during these steps.
4. Divide the maximum sum by `k` to get the maximum average.

## Code

Here is the Java implementation of the described strategy:

```java
public class Solution {
    public double findMaxAverage(int[] nums, int k) {
        double maxSum = 0;
        double currentSum = 0;
        
        // Calculate the initial sum of the first k elements
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            currentSum += nums[i];
        }
        
        maxSum = currentSum;
        
        // Slide the window from k to n
        for (int i = k; i < nums.length; i++) {
            currentSum += nums[i] - nums[i - k];
            maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);
        }
        
        // Return the maximum average
        return maxSum / k;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] nums1 = {1, 12, -5, -6, 50, 3};
        int k1 = 4;
        System.out.println(solution.findMaxAverage(nums1, k1)); // Expected Output: 12.75
        
        int[] nums2 = {5, 5, 5, 5};
        int k2 = 2;
        System.out.println(solution.findMaxAverage(nums2, k2)); // Expected Output: 5.0
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the `nums` array. This is because we need to iterate through the array a single time to compute the sum of elements in the sliding window.

The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since we only need a few variables to keep track of the sum, maximum sum, and the average. Thus, this solution is optimal for the constraints provided in the problem statement.
