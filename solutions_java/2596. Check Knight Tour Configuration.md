[Leetcode 2596. Check Knight Tour Configuration](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2596)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer array `grid` of size `n x n` representing a chessboard. The grid is only filled with integers from 0 to `n^2 - 1`, where `grid[r][c]` represents the position of a knight in a valid knight's tour. A knight's tour is a sequence where the knight visits every square on the chessboard exactly once. The knight can make an "L" shaped move. Determine if `grid` represents a valid knight's tour configuration.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - `grid` is a 2D array of size `n x n`.
   - All elements in `grid` are unique and range from 0 to `n^2 - 1`.

2. **Output:**
   - Return `true` if the `grid` represents a valid knight's tour configuration, otherwise `false`.

3. **Knight's Moves:**
   - The knight can move to one of the eight positions (x + 2, y + 1), (x + 2, y - 1), (x - 2, y + 1), (x - 2, y - 1), (x + 1, y + 2), (x + 1, y - 2), (x - 1, y + 2), (x - 1, y - 2).

## Strategy

1. **Traversal Movement:** 
   - Traverse the grid in the order of the knight's moves based on increasing sequence numbers provided.

2. **Validation Check:**
   - For each number from 0 to `n^2 - 2`, determine if knight can legally move to the next number, i.e., from a cell containing `i` to a cell containing `i+1`.

3. **Knight Moves Validation:**
   - Validate that for each pair of consecutive cells `i` and `i+1`, a valid knight's move exists between their positions.

4. **Result:**
   - If all transitions from `i` to `i+1` are valid, return `true`. Else, return `false`.

## Time Complexity
- Constructing a map to find positions takes O(n^2).
- Validating the knight's moves for all positions takes O(n^2).
- Overall time complexity is O(n^2).

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    private static final int[] dx = {2, 2, 1, 1, -1, -1, -2, -2};
    private static final int[] dy = {1, -1, 2, -2, 2, -2, 1, -1};

    public boolean checkValidGrid(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;

        // Map each number to its coordinates (row, col)
        int[][] position = new int[n * n][2];
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                position[grid[i][j]] = new int[]{i, j};
            }
        }

        // Check all moves from position[i] to position[i+1]
        for (int i = 0; i < n * n - 1; i++) {
            int r1 = position[i][0], c1 = position[i][1];
            int r2 = position[i + 1][0], c2 = position[i + 1][1];
            if (!isValidKnightMove(r1, c1, r2, c2)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    private boolean isValidKnightMove(int r1, int c1, int r2, int c2) {
        for (int i = 0; i < 8; i++) {
            int nr = r1 + dx[i], nc = c1 + dy[i];
            if (nr == r2 && nc == c2) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

Here we map each number on the grid to its row and column, verifying each step in the sequence follows a valid knight's move. This approach ensures an efficient check for a valid knight's tour with time complexity O(n^2).
