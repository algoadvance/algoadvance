[Leetcode 1929. Concatenation of Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1929)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` of length `n`, you want to create an array `ans` of length `2n` where `ans[i] == nums[i]` and `ans[i + n] == nums[i]` for `0 <= i < n` (0-indexed).

Specifically, you need to return the array `ans`.

Example:
- Input: `nums = [1, 2, 1]`
- Output: `[1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1]`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the input array `nums` have negative integers?
   - Yes, the array can have negative integers.
   
2. Is there a constraint on the size of the input array `nums`?
   - Yes, the constraint typically follows as `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`.
   
3. Do we need to preserve the order of elements in the `ans` array?
   - Yes, the order in `ans` should mirror the order in `nums`.

Let's proceed with the solution.


## Strategy

The problem is quite straightforward. We need to concatenate the array `nums` with itself to create the `ans` array. 

Steps:
1. Determine the length of the original array `nums`.
2. Initialize a new array `ans` with a length of `2n`.
3. Populate the first `n` elements of `ans` with elements from `nums`.
4. Populate the next `n` elements of `ans` with elements from `nums` again.
5. Return the `ans` array.

## Code

Here's the Java implementation of the described strategy:

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] getConcatenation(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] ans = new int[2 * n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            ans[i] = nums[i];
            ans[i + n] = nums[i];
        }
        
        return ans;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because we are iterating through the array once to populate the `ans` array.

The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) for the new array `ans` because we are creating a new array that is double the size of the input array `nums`.
