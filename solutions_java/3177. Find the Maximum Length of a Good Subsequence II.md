[Leetcode 3177. Find the Maximum Length of a Good Subsequence II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3177)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `arr`, a subsequence of this array is called **good** if it contains exactly one distinct integer value (only one unique number). Your task is to determine the length of the longest good subsequence.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of values in `arr`:**
   What is the range of possible values in the array `arr`? (e.g., Are there negative values?)
   - **Response:** The array can contain positive integers, negative integers, and zero.

2. **Array length:**
   What is the range of the length of the array `arr`?
   - **Response:** The length of `arr` can be as large as 10,000 elements or more.

3. **Multiple good subsequences:**
   Do we have a unique longest good subsequence or can there be multiple?
   - **Response:** We only need the length of the longest good subsequence. There may be multiple subsequences with the same maximum length, but their length will be the same.

### Strategy

To find the length of the longest good subsequence:
1. **Frequency Counter:** Create a frequency counter/dictionary to count the occurrence of each distinct integer in the array.
2. **Identify Max Frequency:** The length of the longest good subsequence will be the highest frequency count of any integer in the array.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    public int findMaxLengthGoodSubsequence(int[] arr) {
        // Step 1: Create a frequency counter for all elements in the array
        Map<Integer, Integer> frequencyMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (int num : arr) {
            frequencyMap.put(num, frequencyMap.getOrDefault(num, 0) + 1);
        }
        
        // Step 2: Find the maximum frequency in the frequencyMap
        int maxLength = 0;
        for (int count : frequencyMap.values()) {
            if (count > maxLength) {
                maxLength = count;
            }
        }
        
        return maxLength;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] arr = {1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3};
        System.out.println(solution.findMaxLengthGoodSubsequence(arr));  // Output: 3
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Creating Frequency Map:** O(n) - We traverse the array once to count the frequency of each element.
2. **Finding Maximum Frequency:** O(k) - We find the maximum frequency from the frequency map, where k is the number of unique elements in the array.

Hence, the overall time complexity is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the array. This is efficient given the constraints.

### Explanation
- **Step 1:** Using a `HashMap`, we count the occurrences of each number in the array.
- **Step 2:** We then find the maximum value in this map, which represents the length of the longest good subsequence.

This approach ensures an optimal solution by leveraging hash maps for counting and quick look-up operations.
