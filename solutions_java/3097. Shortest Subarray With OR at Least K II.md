[Leetcode 3097. Shortest Subarray With OR at Least K II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3097)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Find the length of the shortest subarray such that the bitwise OR of the elements of this subarray is at least `k`. If no such subarray exists, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of `nums` and values within it:**
   - What is the possible length of the array `nums`? 
   - What is the range of the elements within the array `nums`?
   - Is `k` always a positive integer?

2. **Edge cases:**
   - What should we return if the array is empty?
   - How do we handle cases where no subarray meets the requirement?
   - Are there any constraints on time and space complexity from the problem setter?

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we'll use a sliding window (two-pointer) approach:

1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, both starting at the beginning of the array.
2. Use a variable `current_or` to keep the bitwise OR of the elements in the current window.
3. Expand `right` to include elements in the window until the bitwise OR is at least `k`.
4. Once `current_or` reaches at least `k`, try to contract the window from the left to make it as short as possible while still maintaining the condition.
5. Keep track of the minimum window size and continue adjusting `right` to explore the next possible window.
6. If no such subarray is found, return `-1`.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int shortestSubarrayWithORAtLeastK(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int left = 0;
        int current_or = 0;
        int minLength = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (int right = 0; right < n; right++) {
            current_or |= nums[right];
            
            while (current_or >= k && left <= right) {
                minLength = Math.min(minLength, right - left + 1);
                current_or ^= nums[left];
                left++;
            }
        }
        
        return minLength == Integer.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : minLength;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 4, 8, 16};
        int k = 7;
        System.out.println(sol.shortestSubarrayWithORAtLeastK(nums, k)); // Expected Output: 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initializing pointers and variables: O(1)

2. **Sliding Window:**
   - We iterate over the array `nums` with the `right` pointer once: O(n)
   - Within the nested while loop, each element is processed, but effectively each `left` pointer iteration also processes each element exactly once: O(n)

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is linear with respect to the size of the input array: **O(n)**.

### Space Complexity

The algorithm uses a constant amount of extra space for variables: **O(1)**. The input array itself is not modified, so no additional space related to input size is required.
