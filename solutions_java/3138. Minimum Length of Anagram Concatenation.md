[Leetcode 3138. Minimum Length of Anagram Concatenation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3138)
## Problem Statement:

You are given two strings `str1` and `str2`. You need to concatenate them in any order such that the resultant string is an anagram of another string `target`. Return the minimum length of such a concatenation. If it is not possible to create such a concatenation, return -1.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What are the maximum lengths of `str1`, `str2`, and `target`?
   - Are the strings only composed of lowercase English letters?

2. **Output**:
   - Should we return the combined length of `str1` and `str2` or simply check if it's possible?

## Strategy:
1. **Understanding Anagrams**:
   - An anagram is a permutation of another string.
   - For two strings to be concatenated to form an anagram of the target string, their combined character counts should match the character counts of the target string.

2. **Character Frequency**:
   - Count the frequency of each character in `str1+str2` and `target`.
   - Compare if both have the same frequency count for each character.

3. **Plan**:
   - Count character frequencies of `str1`, `str2`, and `target`.
   - Concatenate `str1` and `str2`, and count the combined character frequencies.
   - Compare the combined frequency with the target frequency.
   - If the frequencies match, return the length of the concatenation.
   - If they donâ€™t match, return -1.

## Code:
```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class MinimumLengthAnagramConcatenation {

    public static int minLengthAnagram(String str1, String str2, String target) {
        // Get character frequencies of str1, str2, and target
        Map<Character, Integer> freqStr1 = getFrequencyMap(str1);
        Map<Character, Integer> freqStr2 = getFrequencyMap(str2);
        Map<Character, Integer> freqTarget = getFrequencyMap(target);
        
        // Combine frequencies of str1 and str2
        for (Map.Entry<Character, Integer> entry : freqStr2.entrySet()) {
            freqStr1.put(entry.getKey(), freqStr1.getOrDefault(entry.getKey(), 0) + entry.getValue());
        }
        
        // Compare combined frequency with target frequency
        if (freqStr1.equals(freqTarget)) {
            return str1.length() + str2.length();
        } else {
            return -1;
        }
    }

    private static Map<Character, Integer> getFrequencyMap(String s) {
        Map<Character, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            freq.put(c, freq.getOrDefault(c, 0) + 1);
        }
        return freq;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // Test cases
        System.out.println(minLengthAnagram("ab", "bc", "abbc"));  // Example 1: Should return 4
        System.out.println(minLengthAnagram("xyz", "abc", "xyza"));  // Example 2: Should return -1
        System.out.println(minLengthAnagram("a", "a", "aa"));  // Example 3: Should return 2
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:
- **Frequency Counting**: O(n) where n is the length of the longest input string.
- **Combining Frequencies and Comparison**: O(1) since we're dealing with the 26 lowercase English letters.
- **Overall**: O(n).

In this solution, we efficiently match the frequencies to determine if a concatenation of `str1` and `str2` can form an anagram of `target`. If successful, the combined length is returned; otherwise, -1 is returned.
