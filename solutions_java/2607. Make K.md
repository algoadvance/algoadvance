[Leetcode 2607. Make K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2607)
### Problem Statement

We are given an integer array `arr` and an integer `k`. We need to split the array into `k` contiguous subarrays, and then find the minimum cost to make the sum of these k subarrays equal. The cost to change any element in the array is defined as `1`. The cost is the number of elements we need to increment or decrement to make the subarray sums equal. Return the minimum cost.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**:
   - What is the maximum length of the array `arr`?
   - What is the maximum or range of values within the array elements?

2. **Constraints on k**:
   - Can `k` be greater than the length of the array?

3. **Subarray Formation**:
   - Should all subarrays be of nearly equal size when `k` does not divide the length of the array evenly?

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - What should be done if `k` equals 1 (since only one subarray is the entire array)?

5. **Cost Calculation**:
   - Is the cost calculated individually for each subarray element changed?
 
### Strategy

1. **Subarray Sums**:
   - Determine the sum of the entire array and then target the average sum per subarray based on `k`.

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - Calculate the minimal number of adjustments needed to make each subarray's sum equal to the target sum.

3. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Compute the total sum of `arr`.
   - Compute the target subarray sum as `(total sum) / k`.
   - Iterate over the array to compute and compare subarray sums with the target sum and calculate the cost.

### Code

Here is an initial implementation in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int makeKSubarraySumsEqual(int[] arr, int k) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int totalSum = 0;
        
        // Calculate the total sum of the array
        for (int num : arr) {
            totalSum += num;
        }
        
        // The target subarray sum should ideally be totalSum / k
        int targetSum = totalSum / k;
        
        int minCost = 0;
        
        // Slide through the array to consider possible subarrays
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            int subarraySum = 0;
            
            for (int j = i; j < n; j += k) {
                subarraySum += arr[j];
            }

            // Compute the cost to make subarraySum equal to targetSum
            minCost += Math.abs(subarraySum - targetSum);
        }
        
        return minCost;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Calculation of Total Sum**: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the array.
- **Subarray Cost Calculation**: Each element needs to be processed once, leading to `O(n)` again for this step.

Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`, making it efficient for large arrays.

### Edge Cases

- If `k` is 1, the subarray is the whole array, and the cost is `0`.
- If `k` is greater than the length of the array, it might require a different problem statement (invalid since we can't have more subarrays than elements).

We assume valid inputs are provided as per problem constraints clarification.
