[Leetcode 1387. Sort Integers by The Power Value](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1387)
### Problem Statement

The power of an integer `x` is defined as the number of steps needed to transform `x` into `1` using the following steps:

- if `x` is even, divide it by 2
- if `x` is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1

For example, the power of `3` is `7` because `3` needs `7` steps to become `1` (3 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1).

Given three integers `lo`, `hi` and `k`. The task is to sort all integers in the interval `[lo, hi]` by the power value in ascending order. If two or more integers have the same power value, sort them by their values in ascending order.

Return the `k-th` integer in the resulting sorted list (1-indexed).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on `lo`, `hi`, and `k`?**
   - `1 <= lo <= hi <= 1000`
   - `1 <= k <= hi - lo + 1`

2. **Should we handle cases where `lo` or `hi` is 1 or the same?**
   - Yes, but power computation will still apply similarly. 

3. **Can we assume `lo`, `hi`, and `k` are valid integers given the constraints?**
   - Yes, you can assume inputs are validated as per the constraints.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    private Map<Integer, Integer> powerCache;

    public Solution() {
        powerCache = new HashMap<>();
    }

    public int getPower(int x) {
        if (powerCache.containsKey(x)) return powerCache.get(x);
        int original = x;
        int steps = 0;
        while (x != 1) {
            if (x % 2 == 0) {
                x = x / 2;
            } else {
                x = 3 * x + 1;
            }
            steps++;
        }
        powerCache.put(original, steps);
        return steps;
    }

    public int getKth(int lo, int hi, int k) {
        List<int[]> powerList = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int i = lo; i <= hi; ++i) {
            powerList.add(new int[]{i, getPower(i)});
        }
        
        // Sort by power value, then by the number itself
        Collections.sort(powerList, (a, b) -> {
            if (a[1] != b[1]) {
                return Integer.compare(a[1], b[1]);
            } else {
                return Integer.compare(a[0], b[0]);
            }
        });
        
        return powerList.get(k - 1)[0];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.getKth(12, 15, 2));  // Output should be 13
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Define Power Function Calculation**: The `getPower` function recursively computes the power value of a given integer. A map is used to cache already computed power values to optimize performance.

2. **Generate Power List**: For each integer in the range `[lo, hi]`, compute its power and store it alongside the integer in a list.

3. **Sort the List**: Sort the list primarily by the computed power values and secondarily by the integer values if the power values are equal.

4. **Retrieve k-th Element**: After sorting, the k-th element (1-indexed) in the sorted list is returned.

### Time Complexity

1. **Power Calculation**: Each power calculation involves repeated operations which is roughly O(log n) for an integer `n`. However, due to caching, many computations can be avoided leading to much better performance in practice.

2. **List Construction**: Constructing the list involves iterating through `[lo, hi]`, which is O(n) where n is the number of elements in the range.

3. **Sorting**: The sorting step involves sorting n elements, giving it a time complexity of O(n log n).

Hence, the overall time complexity is O(n log n), accounting primarily for the sorting step. The space complexity is O(n) due to the list and cache storage.
