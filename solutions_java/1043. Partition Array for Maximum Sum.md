[Leetcode 1043. Partition Array for Maximum Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1043)
### Problem Statement

The problem can be found on LeetCode with the following description:

Given an integer array `arr`, you should partition the array into (contiguous) subarrays of length at most `k`. After partitioning, each subarray has their values changed to become the maximum value of that subarray.

Return the largest sum of the given array after partitioning.

### Example
```
Input: arr = [1,15,7,9,2,5,10], k = 3
Output: 84
Explanation: arr becomes [15,15,15,9,10,10,10]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Is the array always non-empty?**
   - **A: Yes, assume the array has at least one element.**

2. **Q: Can k be larger than the length of the array?**
   - **A: No, k will always be less than or equal to the array length.**

3. **Q: Can the elements in the array be negative?**
   - **A: The problem statement doesn’t specify that elements will always be positive, so it’s safer to assume they can be negative.**

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we'll use dynamic programming to maximize the sum of the array after partitioning. The main idea is:

1. Define `dp[i]` as the maximum sum we can obtain for the subarray `arr[0]` to `arr[i]`.
2. For each position `i`, consider partitioning the array ending at `i` with all possible subarray lengths `j` (where `1 <= j <= k`).
3. For each possible partition length `j`, update `dp[i]` by choosing the maximum value in the last `j` elements of the subarray and extending the partition.

### Code

Here’s how you can implement the solution in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxSumAfterPartitioning(int[] arr, int k) {
        int n = arr.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int maxInPartition = 0;
            for (int j = 1; j <= k && i - j + 1 >= 0; j++) {
                maxInPartition = Math.max(maxInPartition, arr[i - j + 1]);
                int prevPartitionSum = (i - j >= 0) ? dp[i - j] : 0;
                dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], prevPartitionSum + maxInPartition * j);
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n - 1];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is \(O(n \cdot k)\), where:
- \(n\) is the number of elements in the array.
- For each element, we potentially look back at most \(k\) elements to form partitions.

Therefore, this is efficient enough for the typical constraint limits you might see in a coding interview.
