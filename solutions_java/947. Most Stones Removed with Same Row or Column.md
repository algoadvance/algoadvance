[Leetcode 947. Most Stones Removed with Same Row or Column](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l947)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of stones where `stones[i] = [xi, yi]` represents the position of the `i-th` stone on a 2D plane. Two stones will be considered in the same connected component if they share the same row or the same column. You need to find the largest possible number of stones that can be removed such that, after the removal, there is still at least one stone left in each connected component.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can there be multiple stones at the same position?
   - No, each stone is uniquely positioned as per the problem constraints.
2. What is the maximum number of stones?
   - The constraint is typically around `1000` stones.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we need to consider the connected components formed by stones that share the same row or column. The idea is that, in each connected component, we can remove all but one stone. Therefore, the number of stones that can be removed is `total_stones - number_of_components`.

We can employ a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Union-Find algorithm to find all the connected components. Both methods are efficient for handling this problem.

### Code: Using Union-Find
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int removeStones(int[][] stones) {
        int n = stones.length;
        UnionFind uf = new UnionFind(n);
        
        Map<Integer, Integer> rowMap = new HashMap<>();
        Map<Integer, Integer> colMap = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int x = stones[i][0];
            int y = stones[i][1];
            
            // Union stones in the same row
            if (rowMap.containsKey(x)) {
                uf.union(i, rowMap.get(x));
            } else {
                rowMap.put(x, i);
            }
            
            // Union stones in the same column
            if (colMap.containsKey(y)) {
                uf.union(i, colMap.get(y));
            } else {
                colMap.put(y, i);
            }
        }

        // Count the number of connected components
        Set<Integer> uniqueComponents = new HashSet<>();
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            uniqueComponents.add(uf.find(i));
        }
        
        // Maximum stones can be removed
        return n - uniqueComponents.size();
    }

    class UnionFind {
        int[] parent;
        int[] rank;

        UnionFind(int size) {
            parent = new int[size];
            rank = new int[size];
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                parent[i] = i;
                rank[i] = 0;
            }
        }

        int find(int x) {
            if (parent[x] != x) {
                parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
            }
            return parent[x];
        }

        void union(int x, int y) {
            int rootX = find(x);
            int rootY = find(y);

            if (rootX != rootY) {
                if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]) {
                    parent[rootY] = rootX;
                } else if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]) {
                    parent[rootX] = rootY;
                } else {
                    parent[rootY] = rootX;
                    rank[rootX]++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The Union-Find operations (`find` and `union`) are nearly constant time, i.e., almost O(1) due to path compression and union by rank.
- Initializing maps and processing each stone takes linear time, making the overall time complexity O(n).

### Summary
- We use Union-Find to keep track of connected components.
- We traverse each stone and union any stones in the same row or column.
- By the end, we identify unique connected components and calculate maximum removable stones as `total_stones - number_of_components`.
