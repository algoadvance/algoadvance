[Leetcode 2201. Count Artifacts That Can Be Extracted](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2201)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `n x n` grid that represents a map of an excavation site. You are also given an integer array `artifacts` consisting of arrays where each `artifacts[i] = [r1i, c1i, r2i, c2i]` represents the coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right cells of the `i`-th artifact. 

The excavation site is represented by the integer matrix `dig` consisting of arrays where each `dig[i] = [ri, ci]` represents that the cell located at `(ri, ci)` has been excavated. 

Return the number of artifacts that can be extracted in full. An artifact can be extracted in full if and only if all the cells within its rectangular area are excavated.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What values can `n` take?**
   - The value of `n` will be such that the grid is an `n x n` grid, where 1 <= n <= 1000.

2. **What are the constraints on the coordinates of artifacts?**
   - Coordinates will always be within the bounds of the grid.

3. **What if multiple `dig` entries point to the same cell?**
   - Each dig entry is unique.

4. **Are there any performance constraints?**
   - The solution should be efficient enough to handle the largest possible input sizes in a reasonable time.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize the Grid:**
   - Create a boolean grid of size `n x n` to mark cells that have been dug.

2. **Mark Dug Locations:**
   - Iterate through the `dig` array and mark the corresponding cells in the boolean grid as `true`.

3. **Validate Artifacts:**
   - For each artifact, check if all the cells in its rectangular area are marked as `true` in the grid.
   - If all the cells of an artifact are `true`, increment the artifact count.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int countArtifacts(int n, int[][] artifacts, int[][] dig) {
        // Step 1: Initialize the dug grid
        boolean[][] dugGrid = new boolean[n][n];
        
        // Step 2: Mark all dug cells in the grid
        for (int[] d : dig) {
            int r = d[0], c = d[1];
            dugGrid[r][c] = true;
        }
        
        int extractedArtifacts = 0;
        
        // Step 3: Check each artifact
        for (int[] artifact : artifacts) {
            int r1 = artifact[0], c1 = artifact[1], r2 = artifact[2], c2 = artifact[3];
            boolean canExtract = true;
            
            // Traverse cells in the artifact's rectangle
            for (int r = r1; r <= r2 && canExtract; r++) {
                for (int c = c1; c <= c2; c++) {
                    if (!dugGrid[r][c]) {
                        canExtract = false;
                        break;
                    }
                }
            }
            
            // Increment count if all cells are dug
            if (canExtract) {
                extractedArtifacts++;
            }
        }
        
        return extractedArtifacts;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization of dugGrid:** O(n^2)
- **Marking dug cells:** O(d), where `d` is the number of digs.
- **Checking artifacts:** O(a * m), where `a` is the number of artifacts and `m` is the number of cells in the largest artifact.
- In the worst case, this is O(n^2 + d + a * n^2).
- Given the constraints, this approach will be efficient enough for the input sizes provided.
