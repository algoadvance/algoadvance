[Leetcode 403. Frog Jump](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l403)
### Problem Statement

A frog is crossing a river. The river is divided into `n` units and at each unit, there may or may not exist a stone. The frog starts at unit 0, which is always a stone, and attempts to jump to the last stone (`n-1`). The frog can only jump `k-1`, `k`, or `k+1` units in distance from a stone at position `x` if it had previously jumped exactly `k` units to reach that stone.

Given a list of `stones` positions (in units) in sorted ascending order, determine if the frog can cross the river by landing on the last stone. The frog can only jump in the following manner:
1. From position x to position x + k - 1
2. From position x to position x + k
3. From position x to position x + k + 1

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the values in the `stones` array unique?**
   - Yes, each stone position is unique.

2. **Will the stones array always include the first (0) and the last (n-1) stones?**
   - Yes, the first and the last stones will always be there.

3. **What's the maximum length of the `stones` array?**
   - Assume the length can be around 2000.

### Strategy

1. **State Representation**:
   - Use a Set to record which positions we have checked and the corresponding jump lengths that got us there.

2. **Stone Positions as Keys**:
   - Use a Map where the key is the stone position and the value is a set of all jumps that landed on this position.

3. **Approach**:
   - Use BFS (Breadth-First Search) to explore each possible jump from current positions.
   - Always keep track of visited positions with the corresponding jump lengths to avoid redundant calculations.

4. **Termination Condition**:
   - If the last stone is reached, return true.
   - If the positions & jumps set is exhausted without reaching the end, return false.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public boolean canCross(int[] stones) {
        if (stones == null || stones.length == 0) {
            return false;
        }
        
        Map<Integer, Set<Integer>> map = new HashMap<>();
        for (int stone : stones) {
            map.put(stone, new HashSet<>());
        }
        map.get(0).add(0);
        
        for (int stone : stones) {
            for (int jump : map.get(stone)) {
                for (int k = jump - 1; k <= jump + 1; k++) {
                    if (k > 0 && map.containsKey(stone + k)) {
                        map.get(stone + k).add(k);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return !map.get(stones[stones.length - 1]).isEmpty();
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is `O(n^2)` where `n` is the number of stones. This is because, in the worst case, each stone could potentially be reached by jumps from various previous stones, but the map structure ensures that each position is only processed once per possible jump length. For each stone `i`, in the worst case, we process it up to `i` times.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is `O(n^2)` due to the map storing jumps for each stone.
