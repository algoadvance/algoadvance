[Leetcode 1668. Maximum Repeating Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1668)
### Problem Statement

We are given a string `sequence` and a string `word`. We need to determine the maximum integer `k` such that `word` repeated `k` times is a substring of `sequence`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum length of `sequence` and `word`?**
   Typically, constraints will mention these values. Let's assume `sequence` can be very large, up to 1000 characters, while `word` can be up to 100 characters.

2. **Can `sequence` or `word` contain special characters or whitespace?**
   Assume both can consist of any printable characters, including lowercase and uppercase letters, digits, punctuation, and whitespace.

3. **Is `k` guaranteed to be at least 1?**
   Yes, the problem implies finding the maximum repeating `k`, where `k` is at least 1.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to form the repeated versions of `word` and check whether it is a substring of `sequence`. 

1. **Initialize `k` to 0** - a variable to keep track of the maximum repeats.
2. **Construct repeated words** - Create a string by repeating `word` `k` times.
3. **Check for substrings** - Continue checking from `k=1` to the point where the repeated string cannot be found in `sequence`.

Steps:
1. Start with `k=1` and repeatedly append `word` to itself.
2. Check if the resulting string is a substring of `sequence`.
3. If it is, increment `k` and repeat.
4. Stop when the repeated word is no longer found in the `sequence`.
5. The last valid `k` is the answer.

### Code

Here's the implementation in Java:

```java
public class MaximumRepeatingSubstring {
    public int maxRepeating(String sequence, String word) {
        int k = 0;
        String repeatedWord = word;
        
        // Try increasing k by checking repeating word["", "word", "wordword", ...] in sequence
        while (sequence.contains(repeatedWord)) {
            k++;
            repeatedWord += word;
        }
        
        return k;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximumRepeatingSubstring mrs = new MaximumRepeatingSubstring();
        // Example tests
        System.out.println(mrs.maxRepeating("ababc", "ab")); // Output: 2
        System.out.println(mrs.maxRepeating("ababc", "ba")); // Output: 1
        System.out.println(mrs.maxRepeating("ababc", "ac")); // Output: 0
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Constructing the repeated string** - Each concatenation operation takes O(m) time where m is the length of `word`.
- **Checking substring** - Checking if a string of length `k*m` (where `m` is length of `word`) is a substring of `sequence` (length `n`) can be done in O(n) time in the worst case.

Since these operations are performed up to `k` times:

1. **String concatenation for k times** - O(k * m)
2. **Substring checking performed k times for increasing lengths** - O(k * n)

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(k * (m + n)). In the worst case, k could be approximately n / m.

This ensures an efficient and clear solution for the problem.
