[Leetcode 460. LFU Cache](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l460)
## Problem Statement:

Design and implement a data structure for a Least Frequently Used (LFU) cache.

Implement the LFUCache class:

- `LFUCache(int capacity)` Initializes the object with the capacity of the data structure.
- `int get(int key)` Gets the value of the key if the key exists in the cache. Otherwise, returns -1.
- `void put(int key, int value)` Updates the value of the key if present, or inserts the key if not already present. When the cache reaches its capacity, it should invalidate and remove the least frequently used key before inserting a new item. For this problem, when there is a tie (i.e., two or more keys with the same frequency), the least recently used key would be evicted.

**Example:**

```java
LFUCache lfu = new LFUCache(2);
lfu.put(1, 1);   // cache=[1,_], cnt(1)=1
lfu.put(2, 2);   // cache=[2,1], cnt(2)=1, cnt(1)=1
lfu.get(1);      // return 1
                 // cache=[1,2], cnt(2)=1, cnt(1)=2
lfu.put(3, 3);   // 2 is the least frequently used, so it gets removed.
                 // cache=[3,1], cnt(3)=1, cnt(1)=2
lfu.get(2);      // return -1 (not found)
lfu.get(3);      // return 3
                 // cache=[3,1], cnt(3)=2, cnt(1)=2
lfu.put(4, 4);   // Both 3 and 1 have a frequency of 2. Then choose the least recent one.
                 // cache=[4,3], cnt(4)=1, cnt(3)=2
lfu.get(1);      // return -1 (not found)
lfu.get(3);      // return 3
                 // cache=[3,4], cnt(4)=1, cnt(3)=3
lfu.get(4);      // return 4
                 // cache=[3,4], cnt(4)=2, cnt(3)=3
```

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q**: What is the maximum size of the cache?
   **A**: It will be initialized with a specified capacity, and we need to handle varying capacities as specified during initialization.

2. **Q**: If the capacity is zero, should the cache still store values?
   **A**: No, if the capacity is zero, all `put` operations will be ignored.

3. **Q**: Should we handle negative or zero values for the keys and values?
   **A**: Assume keys and values are positive integers.

4. **Q**: Are there any specific performance requirements?
   **A**: The goal is to achieve O(1) time complexity for both `get` and `put` operations.

## Strategy:

1. **Data Structures**:
   - A hashmap (`keyToVal`) to store the keys and their corresponding values.
   - A hashmap (`keyToFreq`) to store the keys and their corresponding frequencies.
   - A hashmap of linked hashsets (`freqToKeys`) to store lists of keys with the same frequency. We will use a linked hashset to maintain the order of insertion (for resolving ties).
   - Keep track of the minimum frequency (`minFreq`).

2. **Operations**:
   - For the `get` operation, we will check if the key exists. If it does, we return the value and update the frequency.
   - For the `put` operation, we will check if the key already exists:
     - If it does, we update its value and frequency.
     - If it does not, we check the cache capacity and possibly evict the least frequently used key before inserting the new key and updating frequency.

3. **Eviction Policy**:
   - When evicting, we select a key from the linked hashset of keys with the minimum frequency and remove it.

## Code:

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.LinkedHashSet;

class LFUCache {

    private final int capacity;
    private int minFreq;
    private final HashMap<Integer, Integer> keyToVal;
    private final HashMap<Integer, Integer> keyToFreq;
    private final HashMap<Integer, LinkedHashSet<Integer>> freqToKeys;

    public LFUCache(int capacity) {
        this.capacity = capacity;
        this.minFreq = 0;
        this.keyToVal = new HashMap<>();
        this.keyToFreq = new HashMap<>();
        this.freqToKeys = new HashMap<>();
    }

    public int get(int key) {
        if (!keyToVal.containsKey(key)) {
            return -1;
        }

        int currFreq = keyToFreq.get(key);
        keyToFreq.put(key, currFreq + 1);
        freqToKeys.get(currFreq).remove(key);

        if (currFreq == minFreq && freqToKeys.get(currFreq).isEmpty()) {
            minFreq++;
        }

        freqToKeys.computeIfAbsent(currFreq + 1, k -> new LinkedHashSet<>()).add(key);
        return keyToVal.get(key);
    }

    public void put(int key, int value) {
        if (capacity == 0) {
            return;
        }

        if (keyToVal.containsKey(key)) {
            keyToVal.put(key, value);
            get(key);
            return;
        }

        if (keyToVal.size() >= capacity) {
            int evict = freqToKeys.get(minFreq).iterator().next();
            freqToKeys.get(minFreq).remove(evict);
            keyToVal.remove(evict);
            keyToFreq.remove(evict);
        }

        keyToVal.put(key, value);
        keyToFreq.put(key, 1);
        minFreq = 1;
        freqToKeys.computeIfAbsent(minFreq, k -> new LinkedHashSet<>()).add(key);
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:
- **`get` Operation**: O(1) because it involves hash map lookups and updates.
- **`put` Operation**: O(1) since it involves hash map operations and possibly one eviction from a linked hashset.

This design ensures efficient operations while adhering to the LFU eviction policy.
