[Leetcode 1344. Angle Between Hands of a Clock](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1344)
### Problem Statement

Given two numbers, `hour` and `minutes`, return the smaller angle (in degrees) formed between the hour and the minute hand on a clock.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Inputs**:
    - `hour`: Integer from 1 to 12 (inclusive)
    - `minutes`: Integer from 0 to 59 (inclusive)

2. **Output**:
    - The function should return the smaller angle in degrees, which will be a floating-point number.

3. **Edge Cases**:
    - What happens at exact hours (e.g., 3:00)?
    - How do we handle the transition from 12 to 1 o'clock?

### Strategy

1. **Calculate the Position of the Minute Hand**:
   - Each minute, the minute hand moves by `6` degrees since there are `360` degrees in total and `60` minutes.
   - `minute_angle = minutes * 6`

2. **Calculate the Position of the Hour Hand**:
   - Each hour, the hour hand moves by `30` degrees since there are `12` hours on the clock and `360` degrees in total.
   - Additionally, the hour hand moves as the minute hand moves:
     - `hour_angle = (hour % 12) * 30 + minutes * 0.5`
     - We take `hour % 12` to handle the transition from 12 to 1 o'clock.

3. **Calculate the Angle Between the Two Hands**:
   - The absolute difference between the two angles gives one of the angles.
   - i.e., `angle = abs(hour_angle - minute_angle)`

4. **Find the Smaller Angle**:
   - Because the clock is circular, the smaller angle formed needs to take into account the complementary angle:
     - `smaller_angle = min(angle, 360 - angle)`

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public double angleClock(int hour, int minutes) {
        // Calculate the angle for the minute hand
        double minute_angle = minutes * 6.0;  // 360 degrees / 60 minutes
        
        // Calculate the angle for the hour hand
        double hour_angle = (hour % 12) * 30.0 + minutes * 0.5;  // 360 degrees / 12 hours + move fraction
        
        // Calculate the difference between the two angles
        double angle = Math.abs(hour_angle - minute_angle);
        
        // Find the smaller angle
        return Math.min(angle, 360 - angle);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.angleClock(3, 30)); // Expected output: 75.0
        System.out.println(sol.angleClock(12, 30)); // Expected output: 165.0
        System.out.println(sol.angleClock(9, 00)); // Expected output: 90.0
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the approach is **O(1)** since all operations (multiplication, addition, modulus, subtraction, and comparison) are constant time operations. Hence, the function will run in constant time regardless of the specific inputs.
