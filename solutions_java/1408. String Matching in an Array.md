[Leetcode 1408. String Matching in an Array full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1408)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of string `words`, return all strings in `words` that are a substring of another word in any order. A string `words[i]` is a substring of `words[j]`, if `i != j` and `words[i]` is a substring of `words[j]`.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: words = ["mass","as","hero","superhero"]
Output: ["as","hero"]

Input: words = ["leetcode","et","code"]
Output: ["et","code"]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Case Sensitivity:** Are the words case-sensitive?
   - Yes, treat the strings as case-sensitive.
   
2. **Input Constraints:** Are there any constraints on the length of the array or the length of individual strings?
   - The length of `words` and individual strings should be reasonable to fit into memory.
   
3. **Output Order:** Is there any specific order in which we need to return the substrings?
   - No, the output order does not matter.

4. **Duplicates:** Can `words` contain duplicate strings?
   - Yes, `words` can contain duplicates.

### Strategy

1. **Brute Force Approach:**
   - Loop through each combination of two words from the array.
   - For each pair, check if one string is a substring of the other.
   - If it is, add the substring to the result set.
   - Using a set will help to maintain unique substrings.
   
2. **Steps:**
   1. Initialize an empty set `substrings` to store unique substrings.
   2. Loop through each word in the list.
   3. Inside this loop, run another loop to check every other word to see if the current word is a substring of the other.
   4. If the current word is a substring of another word, add it to the set.
   5. Convert the set to a list and return it.

### Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.List;

public class StringMatchingInAnArray {
    public List<String> stringMatching(String[] words) {
        // Initialize a HashSet to keep track of unique substrings
        HashSet<String> substrings = new HashSet<>();
        
        // Length of the words array
        int n = words.length;
        
        // Loop through each pair of words in the array
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i != j && words[j].contains(words[i])) {
                    substrings.add(words[i]);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Convert the set to a list and return it
        return new ArrayList<>(substrings);
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StringMatchingInAnArray solution = new StringMatchingInAnArray();
        String[] words1 = {"mass","as","hero","superhero"};
        System.out.println(solution.stringMatching(words1)); // Output: [as, hero]
        
        String[] words2 = {"leetcode","et","code"};
        System.out.println(solution.stringMatching(words2)); // Output: [et, code]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Time Complexity:**
   - The worst-case time complexity is \(O(n^2 \cdot m)\);
     - \(n\): Number of words in the array.
     - \(m\): Average length of a word.
   - Each word is checked against every other word to see if it is a substring, leading to \(O(n^2)\) comparisons, and the `contains()` method runs in \(O(m)\).

2. **Space Complexity:**
   - The space complexity is \(O(n)\) to store up to `n` substrings in the HashSet and the final list.
