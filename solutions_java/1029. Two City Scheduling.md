[Leetcode 1029. Two City Scheduling](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1029)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `costs` where `costs[i] = [aCost, bCost]` describes the cost of flying the i-th person to city A and city B, respectively.

Return the minimum cost to fly every person to a city such that exactly `n` people arrive in each city.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input size:**
   - How large is the input array?
   - Example clarification: `costs = [[10,20],[30,200],[50,100],[20,120]]`
 
2. **Constraints:**
   - Is it guaranteed that `2n` people have to be split exactly into `n` people for city A and `n` for city B?
   - What are the constraints on the values of `aCost` and `bCost`?

3. **Output:**
   - The function should return a single integer representing the minimum cost.

### Strategy

The goal of this problem is to minimize the total cost of flying people to two cities with exactly half (say `n`) flying to city A and the other half flying to city B.

We can use the following strategy:
1. **Calculate Differential Cost:** For each person, calculate the difference in cost between flying to city A and city B.
2. **Sort by Differential Cost:** Sort the list of costs based on the difference calculated. People with the greatest difference (who have a strong preference for one city over another) should be assigned to their preferred city.
3. **Assign Cities:** Assign the first `n` people to city A and the rest to city B (or vice-versa depends on the cost).

### Code
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class TwoCityScheduling {
    public int twoCitySchedCost(int[][] costs) {
        // Sort costs by the difference in costs between city A and city B
        Arrays.sort(costs, (a, b) -> (a[0] - a[1]) - (b[0] - b[1]));
        
        int n = costs.length / 2;
        int totalCost = 0;
        
        // First half goes to city A, second half goes to city B
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            totalCost += costs[i][0];
        }
        for (int i = n; i < 2 * n; i++) {
            totalCost += costs[i][1];
        }
        
        return totalCost;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        TwoCityScheduling scheduler = new TwoCityScheduling();
        //int[][] costs = "use value from example";
        
        int result = scheduler.twoCitySchedCost(costs);
        System.out.println("Minimum cost: " + result);  // Expected output: 110
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting Step:** The main time-consuming operation in this solution is the sorting step, which takes \( O(n \log n) \) time where \( n \) is the number of people.
- **Summation Step:** Calculating the total cost will take \( O(n) \) as we simply iterate through the list.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \( O(n \log n) \).

This solution is efficient given the typical constraints of competitive programming and real-world interview problems.
