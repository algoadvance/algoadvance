[Leetcode 551. Student Attendance Record I full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l551)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` representing an attendance record for a student. The record only contains the following three characters:
- 'A': Absent.
- 'L': Late.
- 'P': Present.

A student could be rewarded if their attendance record doesn't contain:
- More than one 'A' (absent), and
- More than two continuous 'L' (late).

You need to implement a function `checkRecord(String s)` that returns `true` if the student could be rewarded according to the given criteria, or `false` otherwise.

#### Example 1:
```plaintext
Input: s = "PPALLP"
Output: true
```

#### Example 2:
```plaintext
Input: s = "PPALLL"
Output: false
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Question:** Can the input string be empty?
   - **Answer:** In this problem context, it is safe to assume the input string is not empty as it represents the attendance record.

2. **Question:** What is the maximum length of the string?
   - **Answer:** The problem doesn't explicitly state a maximum length, but typically for interview questions, constraints are reasonable. Let's assume it fits well within modern memory limits (e.g., up to 10^4 characters).

3. **Question:** Are there any invalid characters in the input string?
   - **Answer:** The problem specifies that the input string will only contain 'A', 'L', and 'P', so we can assume there are no invalid characters.

### Strategy

1. **Count 'A' characters:** Traverse the string and count occurrences of 'A'. If more than one 'A' is found, return `false`.

2. **Check for continuous 'L' characters:** While traversing, check for sequences of three or more consecutive 'L' characters. If such a sequence is found, return `false`.

3. **Return true:** If traversal completes without violating any rules, return `true`.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {

    public boolean checkRecord(String s) {
        int absents = 0;
        int consecutiveLates = 0;

        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == 'A') {
                absents++;
                if (absents > 1) {
                    return false; // More than one 'A'
                }
            }

            if (c == 'L') {
                consecutiveLates++;
                if (consecutiveLates > 2) {
                    return false; // More than two continuous 'L'
                }
            } else {
                consecutiveLates = 0; // Reset count if the current character is not 'L'
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        // Test cases
        System.out.println(solution.checkRecord("PPALLP")); // should return true
        System.out.println(solution.checkRecord("PPALLL")); // should return false
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. We traverse the string once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1). Only a fixed amount of extra space is used, regardless of the input size.

By following these steps, we ensure the solution is both efficient and adheres to the problem's constraints.
