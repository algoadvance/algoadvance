[Leetcode 1648. Sell Diminishing](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1648)
### Problem Statement

You have an inventory of different colored balls, and there is a customer that wants `orders` balls. The customer weirdly values the colored balls regardless of their color and more if consecutive balls have a higher number.

You have to maximize the customer's total value. The value of each ball decreases by one (Diminishing) for every same-colored ball sold consecutively. You can sell the balls in any order, but the trick is that the total value fetched should be maximized.

Given:
- `inventory`: an array where `inventory[i]` represents the number of balls of the `i-th` color.
- `orders`: the total number of balls to be sold.

Return the maximum total value you can achieve.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum length of the `inventory` array?**
   - Assume the length can be up to `10^5`.

2. **What is the maximum value of the balls in `inventory`?**
   - The number of balls in `inventory[i]` can be up to `10^9`.

3. **What is the maximum number of orders?**
   - It can be up to `10^9`.

4. **Will the input `inventory` always have at least one element?**
   - Yes, assume the inventory is non-empty.

5. **Can there be identical counts of balls in different colors, and can these counts change during the process?**
   - Yes and yes.

### Strategy

The primary task is to make sure the total value is maximized. 

1. **Sort** the inventory array in descending order.
2. Use a **priority queue** (max heap) to always get the most valuable available ball.
3. Continuously sell the ball with the highest current value, adjusting the value and decrementing `orders`.
4. Use the arithmetic series sum to quickly calculate the value for blocks of balls rather than looping through each one to speed up computations.
5. Track the current highest ball value and use efficient counting to reduce the number of iterations.

### Code

Here is the Java solution:

```java
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] inventory, int orders) {
        long mod = 1_000_000_007;
        
        PriorityQueue<Integer> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        for (int ball : inventory) {
            pq.offer(ball);
        }
        
        long totalValue = 0;
        
        while (orders > 0) {
            int current = pq.poll();
            int next = pq.isEmpty() ? 0 : pq.peek();
            int count = current - next;
            int sell = Math.min(orders, count);
            
            long sum = sumFromTo(current, current - sell + 1);
            
            totalValue = (totalValue + sum) % mod;
            orders -= sell;
            
            if (current - sell > 0) {
                pq.offer(current - sell);
            }
        }
        
        return (int) totalValue;
    }
    
    private long sumFromTo(int from, int to) {
        return (long) (from + to) * (from - to + 1) / 2;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] inventory = {2, 5};
        int orders = 4;
        int result = sol.maxProfit(inventory, orders);
        System.out.println(result);  // Output: 14
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting**: O(n log n), where `n` is the number of different colors.
2. **Priority Queue operations**: O(log n) per operation. Because we do up to `orders` operations, the overall complexity involves `log n` times the number of operations, O(min(orders log n, n log n)).

Given constraints, this approach is efficient and should handle the upper bounds effectively.
