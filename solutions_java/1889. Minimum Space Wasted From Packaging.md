[Leetcode 1889. Minimum Space Wasted From Packaging](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1889)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `packages` representing the sizes of packages and a 2D array `boxes` where `boxes[i]` is an array of box sizes that the i-th supplier provides. The packages can only be placed into boxes that are large enough to hold them. For each supplier, you can choose any boxes from the array, and you need to minimize the total wasted space by choosing suppliers optimally.

**Total wasted space** is defined as the sum of wasted space for all the packages. The wasted space for each package is the size of the box used minus the size of the package. If there is no box that can fit a package, you must return `-1`.

Return the minimum total wasted space possible (may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`). If there's no possible arrangement, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can we assume that all sizes in the `packages` and `boxes` arrays are positive integers?
2. Are the sizes of packages and the number arrays in `boxes` relatively large?
3. Can there be multiple boxes for each supplier, and can they handle multiple packages?

Clarifying these will help ensure the problem constraints and expectations are understood.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Packages**:
   - First, sort the `packages` array. This allows efficient comparisons to boxes.
  
2. **Iterate Through Each Supplier**:
   - For each supplier, sort their available boxes. 

3. **Greedy Packaging**:
   - For each box size from the supplier, attempt to package using the smallest fitting box.
  
4. **Binary Search for Efficiency**:
   - Using binary search can speed up finding the smallest box that fits each package, reducing the overall time complexity.
  
5. **Calculate Wasted Space**:
   - Track the wasted space for each supplier and find the minimum across all suppliers.

6. **Edge Cases**:
   - Handle cases where no supplier can fit all packages.

### Code

Here is the Java implementation based on the described strategy:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    private static final int MOD = 1000000007;

    public int minWastedSpace(int[] packages, int[][] boxes) {
        Arrays.sort(packages);
        long minWasted = Long.MAX_VALUE;
        
        for (int[] supplierBoxes : boxes) {
            Arrays.sort(supplierBoxes);
            if (supplierBoxes[supplierBoxes.length - 1] < packages[packages.length - 1]) {
                continue; // This supplier cannot fit the largest package
            }
            
            long currentWasted = 0;
            int packageIndex = 0;
            
            for (int box : supplierBoxes) {
                if (packageIndex >= packages.length) {
                    break; // All packages have been placed
                }
                
                // Use binary search to find the first package that is larger than the box
                int nextPackageIndex = upperBound(packages, packageIndex, packages.length, box);
                
                // Calculate the space wasted by the current box
                currentWasted += (long) box * (nextPackageIndex - packageIndex) - sumRange(packages, packageIndex, nextPackageIndex);
                packageIndex = nextPackageIndex;
            }
            
            if (packageIndex == packages.length) {
                minWasted = Math.min(minWasted, currentWasted);
            }
        }
        
        return minWasted < Long.MAX_VALUE ? (int) (minWasted % MOD) : -1;
    }
    
    // Binary search to find upper bound
    private int upperBound(int[] arr, int from, int to, int val) {
        while (from < to) {
            int mid = from + (to - from) / 2;
            if (arr[mid] <= val) {
                from = mid + 1;
            } else {
                to = mid;
            }
        }
        return from;
    }
    
    // Compute the sum of a subarray
    private long sumRange(int[] arr, int from, int to) {
        long sum = 0;
        for (int i = from; i < to; i++) {
            sum += arr[i];
        }
        return sum;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Sorting `packages`: \(O(n \log n)\)
- For each supplier, sorting their boxes: \(O(m_i \log m_i)\) where \(m_i\) is the number of boxes provided by the \(i\)-th supplier.
- For each supplier, iterating through boxes and using binary search for packages: \(O(m_i \log n)\)

The overall complexity is dominated by \(O(B \cdot (m_{\text{max}} \log m_{\text{max}} + m_{\text{max}} \log n))\), where \(B\) is the number of suppliers, \(m_{\text{max}}\) is the maximum number of boxes a supplier provides, and \(n\) is the number of packages. This complexity ensures the solution is efficient even for larger input sizes.
