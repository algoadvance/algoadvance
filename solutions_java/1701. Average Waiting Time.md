[Leetcode 1701. Average Waiting Time](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1701)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `customers`, where `customers[i] = [arrival_i, time_i]`:
- `arrival_i` is the arrival time of the i-th customer at a restaurant,
- `time_i` is the time needed to prepare the food for the i-th customer.

Return the average waiting time of all customers. Solutions within a threshold of 10^-5 of the actual answer are considered correct.

Each customer is served in the order of their arrival.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the number of customers?
   **A**: The maximum number of customers is 10^4.
   
2. **Q**: Can the arrival time of a customer be the same as another?
   **A**: Yes, it's possible for customers to arrive at the same time.

3. **Q**: What are the ranges of `arrival_i` and `time_i`?
   **A**: Both `arrival_i` and `time_i` are non-negative integers and can go up to 10^4.

### Strategy

1. Iterate through the `customers` list. Maintain a `current_time` to keep track of the chef's availability, starting from zero.
2. For each customer:
   - If the `current_time` is less than the customer's arrival time, move the `current_time` to the arrival time.
   - Calculate the waiting time for the current customer as `current_time + time_i - arrival_i`.
   - Add this waiting time to a cumulative total `total_waiting_time`.
   - Update `current_time` to `current_time + time_i`.
3. Calculate the average waiting time by dividing `total_waiting_time` by the number of customers.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public double averageWaitingTime(int[][] customers) {
        long totalWaitingTime = 0;
        long currentTime = 0;

        for (int[] customer : customers) {
            int arrival = customer[0];
            int time = customer[1];

            // If the currentTime is less than the arrival time, advance the currentTime to arrival time
            if (currentTime < arrival) {
                currentTime = arrival;
            }

            // Waiting time for current customer
            long waitingTime = (currentTime - arrival) + time;
            totalWaitingTime += waitingTime;

            // Update currentTime to the time when this customer's order is completed
            currentTime += time;
        }

        // Return the average waiting time
        return totalWaitingTime * 1.0 / customers.length;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[][] customers1 = { {1, 2}, {2, 5}, {4, 3} };
        System.out.println(sol.averageWaitingTime(customers1)); // Output: 5.0
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

**Time Complexity:** O(n) where `n` is the number of customers. The algorithm processes each customer exactly once.

**Space Complexity:** O(1) aside from the input, the space used by the algorithm does not scale with the input size.
