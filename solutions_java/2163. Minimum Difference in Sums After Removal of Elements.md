[Leetcode 2163. Minimum Difference in Sums After Removal of Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2163)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` consisting of `3 * n` elements. You are allowed to remove exactly `n` elements from the front and `n` elements from the back to create a new array consisting of `n` elements.

Define the `Sum Difference` as the difference between the sum of the largest `n` elements in the new array and the sum of the smallest `n` elements in the new array.

Return the minimum `Sum Difference` possible after removing the required elements.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on the array elements?**
   - The elements in `nums` could be negative, zero, or positive.
   
2. **Size of the nums array?**
   - The length of the input array `nums` is always `3 * n`, which means it is guaranteed to be divisible by 3.

3. **Removal requirements?**
   - We must remove exactly `n` elements from both the beginning and the end of the array, leaving `n` elements in the middle.

4. **Expected output?**
   - We need to return the minimum possible value of the `Sum Difference`.

## Strategy

1. **Initial Approach**:
   - Split the `nums` array into three sections:
     - First section: first `n` elements.
     - Middle section: next `n` elements (after the first section).
     - Last section: last `n` elements.
   
2. **Calculate Sums**:
   - Calculate the prefix sums for the smallest `n` elements from the first section that can be removed.
   - Calculate the suffix sums for the largest `n` elements from the last section that can be removed.
   
3. **Minimize Difference**:
   - Calculate the sum of the smallest `n` elements remaining in the middle portion after the allowed removals.
   - Calculate the sum of the largest `n` elements remaining in the middle portion.
   
4. **Optimization**:
   - Use min-heaps and max-heaps to efficiently manage the largest and smallest elements.

5. **Implementation**:
   - Iterate through the possible dividing points and compute the corresponding sums to find the minimum possible difference.

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity will be mainly determined by the heap operations:
  - Constructing heaps takes `O(n log n)`.
  - Total complexity is `O(n log n)` for prefix sum, suffix sum, and sum differences.

## Code

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public class Solution {
    public long minimumDifference(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length / 3;
        long[] prefixMinSum = new long[2 * n + 1];
        long[] suffixMaxSum = new long[2 * n + 1];

        // Min heap for calculating the prefix min sums
        PriorityQueue<Integer> minHeap = new PriorityQueue<>();
        long sum = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < 2 * n; i++) {
            minHeap.add(nums[i]);
            sum += nums[i];
            if (minHeap.size() > n) {
                sum -= minHeap.poll();
            }
            prefixMinSum[i + 1] = sum;
        }

        // Max heap for calculating the suffix max sums
        PriorityQueue<Integer> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b - a);
        sum = 0;
        for (int i = 3 * n - 1; i >= n; i--) {
            maxHeap.add(nums[i]);
            sum += nums[i];
            if (maxHeap.size() > n) {
                sum -= maxHeap.poll();
            }
            suffixMaxSum[i - n] = sum;
        }

        // Calculate minimum difference
        long minDiff = Long.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, prefixMinSum[i] - suffixMaxSum[i]);
        }

        return minDiff;
    }
}
```

This code utilizes two heaps to manage and calculate prefix and suffix sums for optimal solution derivation.
