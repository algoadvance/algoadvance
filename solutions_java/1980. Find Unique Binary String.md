[Leetcode 1980. Find Unique Binary String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1980)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of binary strings `nums` where each string is of the same length, return a binary string of the same length that does not appear in `nums`. If there are multiple answers, you may return any of them.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size**: What is the maximum length of the binary strings and the maximum number of strings we might encounter?
   - Typical constraints for such problems vary, but let's assume binary strings have a length of \( n \) and there are \( n \) strings.

2. **Output Constraints**: Do we need to ensure the output string is the same length as input strings?
   - Yes, the binary string we return must be the same length as the strings in `nums`.

3. **Duplicate Strings**: Can `nums` contain duplicate binary strings, and if so, does it affect the problem solution?
   - The problem does not specify restrictions about duplicates, but the solution should still be correct regardless.

### Code
```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class UniqueBinaryStringFinder {
    public String findDifferentBinaryString(String[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        Set<String> numSet = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (String num : nums) {
            numSet.add(num);
        }

        return generateUniqueString(numSet, "", n);
    }

    private String generateUniqueString(Set<String> numSet, String cur, int targetLength) {
        if (cur.length() == targetLength) {
            if (!numSet.contains(cur)) {
                return cur;
            }
            return null;
        }
        
        String res = generateUniqueString(numSet, cur + "0", targetLength);
        if (res != null) {
            return res;
        }
        
        return generateUniqueString(numSet, cur + "1", targetLength);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        UniqueBinaryStringFinder finder = new UniqueBinaryStringFinder();
        String[] nums = {"01", "10"};
        System.out.println(finder.findDifferentBinaryString(nums)); // Example output: "00" or "11"
    }
}
```

### Strategy
1. **Initialization**: Convert the input array `nums` into a `HashSet` called `numSet` for O(1) average-time complexity lookups to check existence of strings.
2. **Recursive Generation**: Use a helper method `generateUniqueString` that attempts to build a binary string:
   - For each recursive call, it tries to append either '0' or '1' to the current string `cur`.
   - If the length of `cur` matches the targetLength and it is not in `numSet`, we have found our unique string.
   - Recursively check both options: append '0' and check, if not found, append '1' and check.
3. **Termination**: The recursion terminates when a unique string is found or all possibilities are exhausted.

### Time Complexity
- The overall time complexity is \( O(2^n) \) in the worst case, where \( n \) is the length of the binary strings. This is because we may potentially generate all possible binary strings of length \( n \) to find the unique one. However, practically, this will be much faster due to early termination once we find a valid unique string.
