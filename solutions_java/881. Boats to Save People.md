[Leetcode 881. Boats to Save People](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l881)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array `people` where `people[i]` is the weight of the `i-th` person, and an integer `limit` which represents the maximum weight a boat can carry. Each boat can carry no more than two people at the same time, provided the sum of weights of those people is at most `limit`.

Your task is to find the minimum number of boats required to carry every given person.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can a person be on more than one boat?
   **A:** No, each person must be on exactly one boat.

2. **Q:** Can there be a scenario where it is impossible to fit a person within the given weight limit?
   **A:** No, you can assume that it is always possible to save everyone.

3. **Q:** Can the input array be empty?
   **A:** Since the problem asks to find the minimum number of boats to save people, we can assume the input array `people` will have at least one element.

4. **Q:** How should we handle edge cases, like when all people have the same weight?
   **A:** The solution should account for all edge cases. Sorting the array will help manage such scenarios.

### Strategy
1. **Sort the List:** Start by sorting the list of people based on their weights.
2. **Two Pointers:** Use a two-pointer approach. One pointer (`i`) starts from the beginning (lightest person) and another pointer (`j`) starts from the end (heaviest person).
3. **Pair and Count:** Try to pair the lightest person with the heaviest person who can fit in the same boat. If they can be paired, move both pointers inward; otherwise, move only the pointer for the heaviest person inward.
4. **Move Inward:** Continue this process until all people are assigned to boats.

### Code
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int numRescueBoats(int[] people, int limit) {
        Arrays.sort(people);
        int i = 0;
        int j = people.length - 1;
        int boats = 0;
        
        while (i <= j) {
            // If the lightest and the heaviest person can be in the same boat
            if (people[i] + people[j] <= limit) {
                i++;
                j--;
            } else {
                // Only the heaviest person takes a boat
                j--;
            }
            boats++;
        }
        
        return boats;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] people1 = {1, 2};
        int limit1 = 3;
        System.out.println(solution.numRescueBoats(people1, limit1)); // Output: 1

        int[] people2 = {3, 2, 2, 1};
        int limit2 = 3;
        System.out.println(solution.numRescueBoats(people2, limit2)); // Output: 3

        int[] people3 = {3, 5, 3, 4};
        int limit3 = 5;
        System.out.println(solution.numRescueBoats(people3, limit3)); // Output: 4
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting:** `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of people.
- **Two-pointers traversal:** `O(n)`, as each person is considered at most once.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is `O(1)` for the sorting and two-pointer operations, excluding the input space.

This solution is efficient and handles the problem requirements within optimal time and space constraints.
