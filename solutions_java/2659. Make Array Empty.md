[Leetcode 2659. Make Array Empty](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2659)
### Problem Statement
**2659. Make Array Empty-out**

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` of distinct elements. There is an element `0` in `nums`.

In one operation, you choose any non-zero element `x` and replace it with `0`. Return the minimum number of operations required such that all the elements of the array become `0`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is there any constraint on the values present in the array other than the distinct and 0 element?**
   - The problem specifies distinct elements and one element should be 0.

2. **Should the array be mutated in-place or can we use additional space?**
   - The problem doesn't specify, so additional space can be used to simplify the solution if required.

3. **What is the maximum size of the `nums` array?**
   - This would help in understanding if we need to optimize for larger inputs.

Let's proceed with the provided information.

### Strategy
- Since the array `nums` contains distinct integers and includes exactly one `0`, we need to minimize the total number of operations to turn every non-zero element to zero.
- We can iterate over the array and count each non-zero element, as each non-zero element will need exactly one operation to become zero.
- This is based on the principle that each non-zero element independently needs to be set to zero.
  
### Code
Here's the Java code that implements the given strategy:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int makeArrayEmpty(int[] nums) {
        int operations = 0;
        
        // Loop through the array to count non-zero elements
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num != 0) {
                operations++;
            }
        }
        
        return operations;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        // Sample Test Case
        int[] nums = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4};
        System.out.println(sol.makeArrayEmpty(nums)); // Should output 4
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where `n` is the number of elements in the `nums` array. This is because we need to perform a single pass over the array to count the non-zero elements.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) because we only use a single variable to keep track of the count of operations needed, irrespective of the input size.

This solution is efficient and straightforward, satisfying the problem constraints and requirements.
