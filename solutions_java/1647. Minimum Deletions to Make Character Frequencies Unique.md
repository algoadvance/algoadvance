[Leetcode 1647. Minimum Deletions to Make Character Frequencies Unique](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1647)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return the minimum number of characters you need to delete to make the frequency of each character unique in the string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the string contain any type of characters (e.g., digits, symbols, spaces)?
   - **A:** According to the problem constraints, the string will contain only lowercase English letters.

2. **Q:** What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
   - **A:** The length of the string `s` will be at most `10^5`.

3. **Q:** Should we consider any specific edge cases?
   - **A:** Yes, consider cases where all characters are the same (e.g., `"aaaa"`), or the string already has unique frequencies.

### Strategy

1. **Count Frequencies:** Use a frequency array or hash map to count the frequency of each character in the string.
2. **Sort Frequencies:** Sort these frequencies in descending order to prioritize handling higher frequencies first.
3. **Ensure Uniqueness:** Use a set or another appropriate data structure to track seen frequencies and decrement frequencies until each frequency is unique.

### Code

Let's implement the strategy in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MinimumDeletionsToMakeCharacterFrequenciesUnique {
    public int minDeletions(String s) {
        // Step 1: Count the frequency of each character in the string
        int[] freq = new int[26];
        for (char c : s.toCharArray()) {
            freq[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        // Step 2: Create a list of frequencies and sort it in descending order
        List<Integer> freqList = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int f : freq) {
            if (f > 0) {
                freqList.add(f);
            }
        }
        
        Collections.sort(freqList, Collections.reverseOrder());
        
        // Step 3: Use a set to keep track of used frequencies and calculate deletions
        Set<Integer> seenFreq = new HashSet<>();
        int deletions = 0;
        
        for (int f : freqList) {
            while (f > 0 && seenFreq.contains(f)) {
                f--;
                deletions++;
            }
            if (f > 0) {
                seenFreq.add(f);
            }
        }
        
        return deletions;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumDeletionsToMakeCharacterFrequenciesUnique solution = new MinimumDeletionsToMakeCharacterFrequenciesUnique();
        String s1 = "aab";
        String s2 = "aaabbbcc";
        String s3 = "ceabaacb";
        
        System.out.println(solution.minDeletions(s1)); // Output: 0
        System.out.println(solution.minDeletions(s2)); // Output: 2
        System.out.println(solution.minDeletions(s3)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Counting Frequencies:** O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`.
2. **Sorting Frequencies:** O(m log m), where m is the number of unique characters (at most 26, so it's constant time in practical scenarios).
3. **Ensuring Unique Frequencies:** O(m), iterating over frequencies and resolving conflicts.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n + m log m), which simplifies to O(n) because `m` is capped at 26. 

This solution is optimal given the constraints of the problem, with linear complexity predominated by the length of the string `s`.
