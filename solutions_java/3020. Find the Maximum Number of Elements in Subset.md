[Leetcode 3020. Find the Maximum Number of Elements in Subset](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3020)
## Problem Statement:

You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. You need to find the maximum number of elements in a subset of `nums` such that the sum of that subset is less than `k`.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - Assumption: Yes, the array can contain negative, positive numbers, or zeros.

2. **Can the array be empty?**
   - Assumption: Yes, the array can be empty. In that case, the subset would also be empty.

3. **Should the solution handle large values of `n` (length of `nums`)?**
   - Assumption: Yes, the solution should be efficient, implying that a brute force approach might not be suitable.

4. **Are there constraints on the size of `k`?**
   - Assumption: No specific constraints on the size of `k`, it can be any integer.

## Strategy:

1. **Sort the Array:** First, sort the array in ascending order. This enables us to start with the smallest elements, maximizing the number of elements in the subset while keeping the sum below `k`.
  
2. **Iterate and Sum:** Iterate through the sorted array, maintaining a running sum and a count of elements added to the subset. Stop adding elements when adding another element would cause the sum to exceed `k`.

3. **Return Count:** The count at the point where we stop adding elements gives us the maximum number of elements in the subset with a sum less than `k`.

## Code:

Here's the Java code that implements the above strategy:

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int maxNumberOfElementsSubset(int[] nums, int k) {
        // Step 1: Sort the array
        Arrays.sort(nums);
        
        // Step 2: Initialize variables for sum and count
        int currentSum = 0;
        int count = 0;
        
        // Step 3: Iterate through the sorted array and keep adding to sum
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (currentSum + num < k) {
                currentSum += num;
                count++;
            } else {
                break; // Stop if the next element can't be added without exceeding k
            }
        }
        
        // Step 4: Return the count of elements
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        
        // Example test cases
        int[] nums1 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
        int k1 = 11;
        System.out.println(solution.maxNumberOfElementsSubset(nums1, k1)); // Output: 4
        
        int[] nums2 = {5, 1, 3, 2, 4};
        int k2 = 6;
        System.out.println(solution.maxNumberOfElementsSubset(nums2, k2)); // Output: 2
        
        int[] nums3 = {-1, -2, -3, -4, -5};
        int k3 = 0;
        System.out.println(solution.maxNumberOfElementsSubset(nums3, k3)); // Output: 5
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:

1. **Sorting the Array:** Sorting the array takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array.
2. **Iterating Through the Array:** Iterating through the array to calculate the sum and count takes \(O(n)\).

Considering both steps, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

This should be efficient for large input sizes typically encountered in coding interviews.
