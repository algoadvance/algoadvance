[Leetcode 2208. Minimum Operations to Halve Array Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2208)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of positive integers `nums`. In one operation, you can choose any number from `nums` and reduce it to half (without rounding). Write a function that returns the minimum number of operations needed to reduce the sum of the array to at most half of its original sum.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can elements be reduced multiple times in sequence?
   - **A:** Yes, any element can be reduced multiple times until it becomes sufficiently small to meet the goal.

2. **Q:** What should be the result if the array is empty?
   - **A:** Since the array is guaranteed to have positive integers, we do not need to handle an empty array case.

3. **Q:** Should I always use greedy methods to get the minimum operations for reducing the sum?
   - **A:** Yes, a greedy method by always halving the largest number will provide the minimum operations.

### Strategy

1. **Calculate the Original Sum:** First, sum up all the elements of the array to get the original sum.
2. **Target Sum:** Calculate half of the original sum.
3. **Use a Max-Heap:** Utilize a max-heap (priority queue) to always halve the largest element first. This strategy ensures the largest reduction in the current iteration.
4. **Repeat Operations:** Continue halving the largest element and summing the results until the current sum is less than or equal to the target sum.
5. **Count Operations:** Track the number of operations performed during the process.

### Code

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;
import java.util.Collections;

public class Solution {
    public int halveArray(int[] nums) {
        // Calculate the original sum of the array
        double originalSum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            originalSum += num;
        }
        
        // Half of the original sum
        double targetSum = originalSum / 2;
        
        // Use a max-heap (priority queue)
        PriorityQueue<Double> maxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>(Collections.reverseOrder());
        for (int num : nums) {
            maxHeap.add((double) num);
        }
        
        int operations = 0;
        double currentSum = originalSum;
        
        // Perform operations until the current sum is less than or equal to the target sum
        while (currentSum > targetSum) {
            // Extract the maximum element
            double largest = maxHeap.poll();
            // Reduce it to half
            double reduced = largest / 2;
            // Subtract the reduction from the current sum
            currentSum -= reduced;
            // Add the reduced number back into the max-heap
            maxHeap.add(reduced);
            // Increment the operation count
            operations++;
        }
        
        return operations;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {5, 19, 8, 1};
        System.out.println(sol.halveArray(nums)); // Should return 3
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Heap Construction:** Building the heap takes \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array.
- **Each Operation:** Each operation involves extracting the maximum element from the heap, which is \(O(\log n)\), and then reinserting an element, which is also \(O(\log n)\).
- **Worst Case:** The worst case happens when the number of operations is proportional to the logarithm of the sum of elements \(S\), leading to a total time complexity of \(O(n \log n + k \log n)\), where \(k\) is the number of operations.

In practice, the greedy approach ensures that the number of operations is minimized, and \(k\) remains manageable within typical input constraints.
