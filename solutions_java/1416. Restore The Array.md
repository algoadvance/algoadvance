[Leetcode 1416. Restore The Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1416)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` that contains only digits ('0' - '9') and a positive integer `k`, you need to return the number of possible arrays that can be printed as `s` and contain values between 1 and `k`. Since the answer may be large, return the answer modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we return if the input string is empty?**
   - The input string won't be empty as per the problem constraints.
   
2. **Can the input string contain leading zeros?**
   - The input string can contain zeros, but leading zeros in numbers are not allowed (other than the single digit '0').
   
3. **What is the range of `k`?**
   - `k` is a positive integer. We can assume k to be reasonably large due to the problem's nature.

### Strategy

The problem involves finding the number of ways to split the string `s` into valid numbers between 1 and `k`. This can be translated into a dynamic programming problem where we use a combination of memoization and iterative checks to build the solution.

Let's define `dp[i]` as the number of ways to split the substring `s[i:]` (starting from index `i` to the end of the string).

Key steps:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - `dp[len(s)] = 1` because there is one way to split an empty string.
2. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - For each index `i` from `len(s) - 1` down to `0`, check each substring `s[i:j]` that could form a valid number (i.e., between 1 and `k` and not having leading zeros).
   - Sum up `dp[j]` for all valid splits.
3. **Modular Arithmetic**:
   - Since the result can be very large, always take the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Code

Hereâ€™s the Java implementation:

```java
public class Solution {
    private static final int MOD = 1_000_000_007;

    public int numberOfArrays(String s, int k) {
        int n = s.length();
        long[] dp = new long[n + 1];
        dp[n] = 1;

        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '0') continue;
            long num = 0;
            for (int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                num = num * 10 + (s.charAt(j) - '0');
                if (num > k) break;
                dp[i] = (dp[i] + dp[j + 1]) % MOD;
            }
        }

        return (int) dp[0];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n * log(k)), as each character is considered for forming valid numbers and each valid number formation involves log(k) operations if the number is close to k.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), due to the `dp` array used for memoization.

This solution provides an efficient way to count the possible arrays ensuring it meets the problem's constraints and handles large outputs properly using modular arithmetic.
