[Leetcode 1044. Longest Duplicate Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1044)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return the longest substring of `s` that appears at least twice. If no such substring exists, return an empty string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**:
    - What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
    
2. **Character Set**:
    - Does the string `s` contain only lowercase English letters?
    
3. **Expected Output**:
    - Should the first found longest duplicate substring be returned in case of multiple longest duplicates?

Once we have these clarifications, we can proceed with devising a strategy.

### Strategy

To find the longest duplicate substring, we can adopt a combination of binary search and a hashing technique (Rabin-Karp algorithm) to efficiently handle the needs of the problem. Hereâ€™s the plan:

1. **Binary Search**:
    - Use binary search on the length of the possible substrings. The search range will be from 1 to the length of the string `s`.

2. **Rabin-Karp Hashing**:
    - Use a rolling hash function to quickly compute hash values of substrings.
    - Check for duplicate hashes of substrings of the length specified by the current mid-point in binary search.

3. **Midpoint Check**:
    - For each midpoint length, use the Rabin-Karp algorithm and hash values stored in a set to check for duplicate substrings.

4. **Result Update**:
    - If a duplicate substring is found for a particular length, update the result and continue searching in the upper half.
    - If no duplicate is found, search in the lower half.

### Code

Here is the implementation of the above strategy in Java:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class Solution {
    public String longestDupSubstring(String s) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = s.length();
        String result = "";
        
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2;
            String dup = findDuplicate(s, mid);
            if (dup != null) {
                result = dup;
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    private String findDuplicate(String s, int length) {
        long modulus = (1L << 32);
        long base = 256;
        
        long hash = 0;
        long baseL = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i < length; i++) {
            hash = (hash * base + s.charAt(i)) % modulus;
            if (i > 0) {
                baseL = (baseL * base) % modulus;
            }
        }
        
        Set<Long> seen = new HashSet<>();
        seen.add(hash);
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= s.length() - length; i++) {
            hash = (hash * base - s.charAt(i - 1) * baseL + s.charAt(i + length - 1)) % modulus;
            if (hash < 0) hash += modulus;
            if (!seen.add(hash)) {
                return s.substring(i, i + length);
            }
        }
        
        return null;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search**: O(log n), where n is the length of the string.
- **Rabin-Karp Hashing**: O(n) for each length check, and d is the average number of iterations.

Putting it all together, the overall time complexity is approximately O(n log n) due to the combination of binary search and substring hashing.

This efficient combination ensures that we can deal with the potentially large input sizes while maintaining robust performance.
