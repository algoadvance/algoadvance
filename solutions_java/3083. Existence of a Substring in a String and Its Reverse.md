[Leetcode 3083. Existence of a Substring in a String and Its Reverse](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3083)
### Problem Statement

Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, write a function to check if there exists a substring in `s1` that is equal to `s2` or its reverse. You need to return `true` if such a substring exists in `s1`; otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Validations:** 
   - Can `s1` and `s2` be empty? If so, what should be the output?
   - Are we considering only alphabetic characters, or could there be numbers and special characters as well?

2. **Case Sensitivity:**
   - Do we treat uppercase and lowercase characters as equal or different?

3. **Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of `s1` and `s2`?
   - Any restrictions on time or space complexity?

### Strategy

1. **Reverse `s2`:** Store the reverse of `s2`.
2. **Check Substring:**
   - Iterate through `s1` to check if `s2` or its reverse appears as substrings.
3. **Optimized Approach:**
   - Use the `contains` method provided by Java's String class for efficient substring searching.

### Time Complexity

1. **String Reverse:** O(n) for reversing `s2` where `n` is the length of `s2`.
2. **Substring Search:** O(m * n) in the worst case, where `m` is the length of `s1` and `n` is the length of `s2`. However, the average complexity of the `.contains` method tends to be more efficient due to internal optimizations.

### Code

```java
public class SubstringReverseCheck {
    public boolean checkSubstring(String s1, String s2) {
        if (s1 == null || s2 == null) return false;
        
        String s2Reversed = new StringBuilder(s2).reverse().toString();
        
        boolean containsS2 = s1.contains(s2);
        boolean containsS2Reversed = s1.contains(s2Reversed);
        
        return containsS2 || containsS2Reversed;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        SubstringReverseCheck checker = new SubstringReverseCheck();
        
        // Test cases
        System.out.println(checker.checkSubstring("abcdefg", "cde")); // true
        System.out.println(checker.checkSubstring("abcdefg", "edc")); // true
        System.out.println(checker.checkSubstring("abcdefg", "xyz")); // false
        System.out.println(checker.checkSubstring("abcdefg", "")); // true, empty is considered a substring
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **StringBuilder Reverse Method:** Reverses `s2`.
2. **String `contains` Method:** Searches for the presence of `s2` or its reverse in `s1`.
3. **Null Checks:** Ensures no null pointer exceptions occur.
4. **Return Statement:** Returns `true` if either `s2` or its reverse is found in `s1`.

This code efficiently uses built-in Java methods to achieve the desired functionality, balancing readability and performance.
