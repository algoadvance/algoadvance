[Leetcode 1579. Remove Max Number of Edges to Keep Graph Fully Traversable](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1579)
### Problem Statement

Alice and Bob have an undirected graph of `n` nodes and `m` edges. However, they can only traverse certain edges, which are divided into three types:

1. Type 1: Can be traversed by Alice only.
2. Type 2: Can be traversed by Bob only.
3. Type 3: Can be traversed by both Alice and Bob.

Your task is to remove the maximum number of edges, such that the graph remains fully traversable by both Alice and Bob.

The graph is fully traversable for Alice if there is a path between any pair of nodes using type 1 or type 3 edges. Similarly, the graph is fully traversable for Bob if there is a path between any pair of nodes using type 2 or type 3 edges.

Write a function `maxNumEdgesToRemove(int n, int[][] edges)` that returns the maximum number of edges you can remove while ensuring Alice and Bob can still traverse the entire graph.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input constraints:**
   - Can `n` and `m` be zero? No, let's assume `n >= 1` and `m >= 0`.
   - What is the range of `n` and `m`? Typically, `1 <= n, m <= 10^5`.

2. **Graph characteristics:**
   - Are the edges provided bidirectional? Yes, the graph is undirected.
   - Can there be duplicate edges in the input? Assume each edge is unique based on the combination of nodes and type.

3. **Edge cases:**
   - Single node graph: The function should return 0 since there are no edges to remove.

### Strategy

We'll use union-find (disjoint-set) to keep track of the connectivity of the graph as we process the edges. The solution approach can be summarized in the following steps:

1. **Union-Find Data Structure**:
   - `parent[i]` will tell the parent of node `i`.
   - `rank[i]` will help in keeping the tree flat by attaching smaller trees under larger ones.

2. **Processing**:
   - First, we will process all type 3 edges (common to both Alice and Bob) facilitating maximum sharing.
   - Secondly, process type 1 edges for Alice.
   - Lastly, process type 2 edges for Bob.

3. **Check Connectivity**:
   - After processing the edges, ensure both Alice and Bob can still fully traverse the graph.
   - Only edges which don't connect new components (already connected by other edges) can be removed.

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxNumEdgesToRemove(int n, int[][] edges) {
        UnionFind ufAlice = new UnionFind(n);
        UnionFind ufBob = new UnionFind(n);
        int removeCount = 0;
        
        // First pass: handle Type 3 edges
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            if (edge[0] == 3) {
                boolean aliceConnected = ufAlice.union(edge[1], edge[2]);
                boolean bobConnected = ufBob.union(edge[1], edge[2]);
                if (!aliceConnected && !bobConnected) {
                    removeCount++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Second pass: handle Type 1 and Type 2 edges
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            if (edge[0] == 1) {
                if (!ufAlice.union(edge[1], edge[2])) {
                    removeCount++;
                }
            } else if (edge[0] == 2) {
                if (!ufBob.union(edge[1], edge[2])) {
                    removeCount++;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Check if both Alice and Bob can traverse the entire graph
        if (ufAlice.getCount() != 1 || ufBob.getCount() != 1) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        return removeCount;
    }
}

class UnionFind {
    private int[] parent;
    private int[] rank;
    private int count;
    
    public UnionFind(int n) {
        parent = new int[n + 1];
        rank = new int[n + 1];
        count = n;
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            parent[i] = i;
            rank[i] = 0;
        }
    }
    
    public int find(int x) {
        if (parent[x] != x) {
            parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
        }
        return parent[x];
    }
    
    public boolean union(int x, int y) {
        int rootX = find(x);
        int rootY = find(y);
        
        if (rootX != rootY) {
            if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]) {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
            } else if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]) {
                parent[rootX] = rootY;
            } else {
                parent[rootY] = rootX;
                rank[rootX]++;
            }
            count--;
            return true;
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    public int getCount() {
        return count;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(m log n)**, where `m` is the number of edges and `n` is the number of nodes. This is efficient for this problem, as each union or find operation is nearly constant time due to path compression and union by rank.
