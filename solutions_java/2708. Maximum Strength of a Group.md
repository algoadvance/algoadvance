[Leetcode 2708. Maximum Strength of a Group](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2708)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. You need to maximize the strength of a group. The strength of a group is defined as the product of the chosen integers from the array. You can select any non-negative number of integers from the array.

Return the maximum strength of the group.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the integers in `nums` positive, negative, or both?**
   - They can be both positive and negative.
   
2. **Can `nums` contain zeroes?**
   - Yes, `nums` can contain zeroes.

3. **What is the size range of the array `nums`?**
   - Assume `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`.

4. **Is there any constraint on the range of the integers in `nums`?**
   - The integers in `nums` are within the range of `-10^9` to `10^9`.

## Strategy

To maximize the product (strength) of a group, consider the following:
1. **Single Positive Number**: The product of a single positive number.
2. **Multiple Positive Numbers**: The product of multiple positive numbers is always positive and larger.
3. **Pairing Negative Numbers**: The product of two negative numbers is positive. Pair negative numbers to maximize the product.
4. **Zero**: Adding zero to the product of any non-zero integers will result in zero. Zero can be excluded unless the entire array is zero.
5. **Handling Single Element Cases**: If the array only has one positive or negative number, that single number is the maximum strength.

**Steps to Approach:**
1. Separate the array into positive, negative, and zeroes.
2. Sort the negative numbers to facilitate pairing.
3. Calculate the product of all positive numbers.
4. Pair and multiply the negative numbers, and multiply the results with the product of the positive numbers.
5. Return the maximum product computed.

## Code

```java
public class MaximumStrengthGroup {
    
    public long maxStrength(int[] nums) {
        if (nums == null || nums.length == 0) return 0;
        
        List<Integer> positives = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Integer> negatives = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num > 0) positives.add(num);
            else if (num < 0) negatives.add(num);
        }

        // Handle case when no positive or negative numbers
        if (positives.isEmpty() && negatives.isEmpty()) return 0;
        
        long maxProduct = 1;
        boolean hasPositive = false;
        for (int num : positives) {
            maxProduct *= num;
            hasPositive = true;
        }

        // Sort negatives and pair them
        Collections.sort(negatives);
        long negativeProduct = 1;
        for (int i = 0; i + 1 < negatives.size(); i += 2) {
            negativeProduct *= negatives.get(i) * negatives.get(i + 1);
        }

        // If unpaired negative number left
        if (negatives.size() % 2 != 0) {
            if (!hasPositive) {
                maxProduct = Math.max(maxProduct, negatives.get(negatives.size() - 1));
            }
        }

        maxProduct *= negativeProduct;
        
        if (maxProduct == 1 && !hasPositive) { // No positive product
            return 0;
        }
        
        return maxProduct;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(N log N)`:
- Sorting the negative numbers takes `O(N log N)`.
- Iterating through the array takes `O(N)`.

The space complexity is `O(N)` due to storing positive and negative lists.
