[Leetcode 969. Pancake Sorting](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l969)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `arr`, you need to sort the array using a series of pancake flips. In one pancake flip, you can take any positive integer `k` (1 ≤ k ≤ arr.length) and reverse the order of the first `k` elements of the array. Return an array of the k-values corresponding to a sequence of pancake flips that sort the input array `arr`. Any valid answer that sorts the array within the allowed flips will be accepted.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can `arr` contain duplicate numbers?
   **A:** No, `arr` will contain distinct integers.
   
2. **Q:** What is the range of the elements in `arr`?
   **A:** The elements of `arr` will be integers in the range [1, arr.length].

3. **Q:** Do we need to optimize the number of flips?
   **A:** The problem does not require minimizing the number of flips, just that the array is sorted using valid flips.

4. **Q:** Do we need to validate the sequence of flips afterward?
   **A:** If the sequence is logically valid and sorts the array, no validation is necessary.

### Strategy
1. Iterate through the array from the end to the beginning to place each element in its correct position.
2. Find the position of the current maximum unsorted element.
3. Flip the array to bring this element to the front.
4. Flip the array to move the current maximum element to its correct position.
5. Repeat until the entire array is sorted.

### Code
```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class PancakeSorting {
    public List<Integer> pancakeSort(int[] arr) {
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        for (int curSize = arr.length; curSize > 1; curSize--) {
            int maxIdx = findMaxIndex(arr, curSize);
            
            if (maxIdx != curSize - 1) {
                // Bring the max value to the front if it's not already at its position
                if (maxIdx != 0) {
                    flip(arr, maxIdx + 1);
                    result.add(maxIdx + 1);
                }
                // Flip the max value to its position
                flip(arr, curSize);
                result.add(curSize);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
    
    private int findMaxIndex(int[] arr, int n) {
        int maxIdx = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (arr[i] > arr[maxIdx]) {
                maxIdx = i;
            }
        }
        return maxIdx;
    }
    
    private void flip(int[] arr, int k) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = k - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            int temp = arr[left];
            arr[left] = arr[right];
            arr[right] = temp;
            left++;
            right--;
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        PancakeSorting solution = new PancakeSorting();
        int[] arr = {3, 2, 4, 1};
        System.out.println(solution.pancakeSort(arr));  // Example output: [3, 4, 2, 3, 2]
    }
}
```
  
### Time Complexity
- **Finding the maximum element:** O(n) for each element to be sorted.
- **Flipping the array:** O(k) where k is the length of the sub-array being flipped.
- Since each element needs to be placed correctly by two flips on average, the overall complexity becomes:
    - Finding max + flipping = O(n) + O(n) = O(n)
    - Repeated for each element, hence O(n^2).

Hence, the overall time complexity is O(n^2).
