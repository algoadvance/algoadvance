[Leetcode 2161. Partition Array According to Given Pivot](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2161)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` and an integer `pivot`. Rearrange the array such that:

1. All elements less than `pivot` appear before all elements equal to `pivot`.
2. All elements equal to `pivot` appear before all elements greater than `pivot`.
3. The relative order of elements less than `pivot` and greater than `pivot` needs to be preserved.

Return the rearranged array.

### Example:

**Input:**
```plaintext
nums = [9, 12, 5, 10, 14, 3, 10], pivot = 10
```

**Output:**
```plaintext
[9, 5, 3, 10, 10, 12, 14]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the array contain negative numbers?
   - Yes.

2. How should elements equal to the pivot be treated?
   - They should appear between the elements less than the pivot and greater than the pivot, preserving their relative order.

3. Can the pivot be an element that does not exist in the array?
   - Yes, and in such a case, the array should be partitioned such that elements greater than the pivot appear last, maintaining the relative order.

4. Is the input sorted?
   - No, the input is not necessarily sorted.

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we will use a three-pass approach. We first create three separate lists:

1. `less`: to store elements less than the pivot.
2. `equal`: to store elements equal to the pivot.
3. `greater`: to store elements greater than the pivot.

Finally, we concatenate these three lists to form the required partitioned array.

### Steps:

1. Iterate through the `nums` array and populate the `less`, `equal`, and `greater` lists based on comparisons with `pivot`.
2. Concatenate the `less`, `equal`, and `greater` lists.
3. Return the concatenated list.

## Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public int[] pivotArray(int[] nums, int pivot) {
        List<Integer> less = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Integer> equal = new ArrayList<>();
        List<Integer> greater = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Step 1: Partitioning elements into less, equal, and greater lists
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num < pivot) {
                less.add(num);
            } else if (num == pivot) {
                equal.add(num);
            } else {
                greater.add(num);
            }
        }
        
        // Step 2: Concatenate the three lists
        int[] result = new int[nums.length];
        int index = 0;
        
        for (int num : less) {
            result[index++] = num;
        }
        for (int num : equal) {
            result[index++] = num;
        }
        for (int num : greater) {
            result[index++] = num;
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input array `nums`. This is because each element is processed exactly once when partitioning into the `less`, `equal`, and `greater` lists, and then there is another linear pass to merge these lists into the result array.

The space complexity is \(O(n)\) as we are using three additional lists to store elements based on their comparison with the pivot.
