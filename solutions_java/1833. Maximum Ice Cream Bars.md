[Leetcode 1833. Maximum Ice Cream Bars](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1833)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `costs` where `costs[i]` is the cost of the i-th ice cream bar in coins. You have an integer `coins` representing the total amount of coins you have.

Return the maximum number of ice cream bars you can buy with the coins you have.

**Examples:**

1. Input: `costs = [1,3,2,4,1]`, `coins = 7`
   Output: `4`
   
   Explanation: The ice cream bars with the costs [1,1,2,3] can be purchased with 7 coins, so you can buy 4 ice cream bars.

2. Input: `costs = [10,6,8,7,7,8]`, `coins = 5`
   Output: `0`
   
   Explanation: You cannot buy any of the ice cream bars since you donâ€™t have enough coins.

3. Input: `costs = [1,6,3,1,2,5]`, `coins = 20`
   Output: `6`
   
   Explanation: All of the ice cream bars can be purchased with 20 coins.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the costs always positive integers?
   - Yes, the costs array consists of positive integers.
   
2. Can `coins` be zero?
   - Yes, if `coins` is zero, the output should be zero as you cannot buy any ice cream bars.

3. Are the length of costs and the value of costs bounded by any limit?
   - Constraints can be assumed similar to common coding problems, like between 1 and 10^5 for the length and cost values.

### Strategy

1. **Sorting the Costs**: To maximize the number of ice cream bars, sort the `costs` array in ascending order.
2. **Purchasing Greedily**: Traverse through the sorted `costs` array and keep purchasing ice cream bars until you can no longer afford the next one.
3. **Counting the Purchases**: Use a counter to keep track of how many ice cream bars you can buy within the given `coins`.

### Time Complexity

- Sorting the `costs` array will take O(n log n).
- Traversing and summing the costs will take O(n).
- Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n log n).

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MaximumIceCreamBars {
    public int maxIceCream(int[] costs, int coins) {
        Arrays.sort(costs); // Sort the costs array
        int count = 0; // Counter for the number of ice cream bars bought

        for (int cost : costs) {
            if (coins >= cost) { 
                coins -= cost; // Spend coins
                count++; // Increase the count of ice cream bars bought
            } else {
                break; // If we do not have enough coins for the next ice cream bar, stop
            }
        }
        
        return count; // Return the total number of ice cream bars bought
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximumIceCreamBars solution = new MaximumIceCreamBars();

        // Test cases
        System.out.println(solution.maxIceCream(new int[]{1, 3, 2, 4, 1}, 7)); // Output: 4
        System.out.println(solution.maxIceCream(new int[]{10, 6, 8, 7, 7, 8}, 5)); // Output: 0
        System.out.println(solution.maxIceCream(new int[]{1, 6, 3, 1, 2, 5}, 20)); // Output: 6
    }
}
```

This code accomplishes the task by first sorting the ice cream costs and then iterating through the sorted costs to maximize the number of ice cream bars purchased with the given coins.
