[Leetcode 883. Projection Area of 3D Shapes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l883)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of `n` `n` integers `grid` where grid[i][j] represents the height of a 3D shape located at position (i, j). We need to calculate the projection area of these 3D shapes onto the xy-plane, yz-plane, and zx-plane.

- The projection area on the xy-plane is simply the number of cells that contain a positive height.
- The projection area on the yz-plane is the sum of the maximum heights in each row.
- The projection area on the zx-plane is the sum of the maximum heights in each column.

Return the total projection area of the 3D shapes.

### Example:
```
Example:
Input: grid = [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: 17
Explanation: Here are the three projections ("shadows") of the shape made with each axis.
```

## Clarifying Questions

- **Q**: Can grid values be negative?
  - **A**: No, grid values represent heights and are hence non-negative.
  
- **Q**: What are the bounds for the grid size?
  - **A**: Typically n ranges from 1 to 50.

- **Q**: Can the grid be non-square?
  - **A**: No, the grid is always n by n.

## Strategy

To solve the problem, we need to calculate the projection areas on three planes:

1. **xy-plane**: This is simply the count of cells with non-zero heights.
2. **yz-plane**: For each row, take the maximum height and sum them up.
3. **zx-plane**: For each column, take the maximum height and sum them up.

Here is how to implement this in Java:

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int projectionArea(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        int xy = 0, yz = 0, zx = 0;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            int maxRow = 0;
            int maxCol = 0;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                // xy-plane projection: count if there's a tower at grid[i][j]
                if (grid[i][j] > 0) xy++;
                
                // yz-plane projection: max height in row i
                maxRow = Math.max(maxRow, grid[i][j]);
                
                // zx-plane projection: max height in column j
                maxCol = Math.max(maxCol, grid[j][i]);
            }
            yz += maxRow;
            zx += maxCol;
        }
        
        return xy + yz + zx;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where n is the length of the grid. Our nested loops each run for n iterations, leading to an overall O(n^2) complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we only use a few integer variables to keep track of our sums and max values.

This approach efficiently calculates the projection areas by iterating through the grid in a structured manner, ensuring we account for all three projections correctly.
