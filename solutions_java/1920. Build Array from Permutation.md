[Leetcode 1920. Build Array from Permutation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1920)
## Problem Statement

Given a zero-based permutation nums (0-indexed), build an array of the same length where `ans[i] = nums[nums[i]]` for each `0 <= i < nums.length` and return it. A zero-based permutation `nums` is an array of distinct integers from `0` to `nums.length - 1` (inclusive).

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [0,2,1,5,3,4]
Output: [0,1,2,4,5,3]
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [5,0,1,2,3,4]
Output: [4,5,0,1,2,3]
```

Constraints:
* `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
* `0 <= nums[i] < nums.length`
* The elements in `nums` are distinct.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the input array be empty?
   **A:** No, the constraints specify that `1 <= nums.length`.

2. **Q:** Will all elements in the input array be unique and within the specified range?
   **A:** Yes, based on the constraints all elements are distinct and within the range `[0, nums.length - 1]`.

3. **Q:** Is there any need to handle invalid input cases?
   **A:** No, it is guaranteed based on constraints that the input will always be valid.

## Strategy

1. Create a new array `ans` of the same length as `nums`.
2. Iterate over the elements of `nums`.
3. For each element at index `i`, set `ans[i]` to `nums[nums[i]]`.
4. Return the array `ans`.

The steps above ensure that the answer array is constructed as required by the problem statement.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] buildArray(int[] nums) {
        int[] ans = new int[nums.length];
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            ans[i] = nums[nums[i]];
        }
        return ans;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

Given the size of the input array `nums` is `n`, the solution:

- Iterates over the array once, making the complexity O(n).
- Each element access and assignment operation is O(1).

Therefore, the time complexity is **O(n)**. The space complexity is also **O(n)** because of the additional array `ans` of the same length as `nums`.

This approach ensures that the operation is efficient and meets the problem's requirements.
