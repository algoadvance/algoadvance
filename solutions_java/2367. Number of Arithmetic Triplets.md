[Leetcode 2367. Number of Arithmetic Triplets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2367)
### Problem Statement:

You are given a **0-indexed**, **strictly increasing** integer array `nums` and a positive integer `diff`. A triplet `(i, j, k)` is an **arithmetic triplet** if the following conditions are met:

- `i < j < k`
- `nums[j] - nums[i] == diff`
- `nums[k] - nums[j] == diff`

Return the number of unique arithmetic triplets.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [0,1,4,6,7,10], diff = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: 
There are 2 unique arithmetic triplets (1, 4, 7) and (4, 7, 10).
```

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the array length or elements?
   **A:** There generally will be constraints but for the sake of this problem, consider typical constraints, e.g., `1 <= nums.length <= 1000` and `0 <= nums[i] <= 2000`.

2. **Q:** Can there be duplicate values in the array?
   **A:** No, the problem states that the array is strictly increasing, so there are no duplicates.

### Strategy:

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a counter to keep track of the number of valid triplets.
   - Use a HashSet to store elements of the array for quick look-up.

2. **Iterate through the array:**
   - For each number in the array, check if both `(number - diff)` and `(number - 2*diff)` exist in the set.
   - If both numbers are found, increment the counter as it forms a valid triplet.

### Code:

```java
import java.util.HashSet;

public class NumberOfArithmeticTriplets {
    public int arithmeticTriplets(int[] nums, int diff) {
        int count = 0;
        // Use a set to store the numbers for O(1) look-up.
        HashSet<Integer> set = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (int num : nums) {
            set.add(num);
        }
        
        // Check for each number if triplet conditions are satisfied.
        for (int num : nums) {
            if (set.contains(num - diff) && set.contains(num - 2 * diff)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NumberOfArithmeticTriplets solution = new NumberOfArithmeticTriplets();
        int[] nums = {0, 1, 4, 6, 7, 10};
        int diff = 3;
        System.out.println(solution.arithmeticTriplets(nums, diff)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the array. We iterate through the array twice (once to fill the set, once to find triplets), each operation being O(1) for set operations.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the array since we store all elements in a set.
