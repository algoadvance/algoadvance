[Leetcode 2289. Steps to Make Array Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2289)
### Problem Statement

Given a 0-indexed array `nums` of integers, you can perform the following operation any number of times:

- Choose an index `i` such that `0 <= i < nums.length - 1` and `nums[i] > nums[i + 1]`.
- Swap the elements at index `i` and `i + 1`.

Return the minimum number of steps to make the array `nums` non-decreasing. The array is non-decreasing if `nums[i] <= nums[i + 1]` for all `0 <= i < nums.length - 1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the size and values of nums?**
    - The size of `nums` is at most `10^5`.
    - The values in `nums` are integers within the range `[-10^9, 10^9]`.

2. **What should we return if the array is already non-decreasing?**
    - If the array is already non-decreasing, we should return `0`.

3. **Can there be duplicate values in the array?**
    - Yes, the array can contain duplicate values.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we want to make the array non-decreasing with the minimum number of swaps. A greedy approach can be used because we should try resolving the biggest issue first - where the array is most out of order.

1. Iterate over the array and whenever we find `nums[i] > nums[i + 1]`, we record the index.
2. Using a loop, we will stabilize our list by iteratively moving misplaced elements to their correct positions. 

For optimization, we can use ideas similar to bubble sort, where we continue looping through the list, pushing down the elements until our list becomes stable (non-decreasing).

### Code

Here's how you can implement this in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int totalSteps(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int[] steps = new int[n];
        int maxSteps = 0;

        for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; --i) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[i + 1]) {
                steps[i] = steps[i+1] + 1;
                maxSteps = Math.max(maxSteps, steps[i]);
            }
        }
        return maxSteps;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Array of Steps**: An array `steps` is created to record how many steps it took to move each element to its rightful place in a non-decreasing order.
2. **Backwards Iteration**: We iterate from the second-to-last element to the first. For each element, if `nums[i] > nums[i+1]`, that is a candidate for swapping and needs steps to stabilize.
3. **Updating Steps**: If the current element `nums[i]` is greater than the next element, we increment the steps count based on the steps needed for the `nums[i+1]`.
4. **Max Steps**: Keep track of the maximum steps required among all elements.

This algorithm ensures that we efficiently track the number of steps required with minimal overhead.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array. This is because we're making a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(n)` due to the additional array used for storing steps.

This approach allows for handling large datasets up to the size limit efficiently.
