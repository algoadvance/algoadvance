[Leetcode 813. Largest Sum of Averages](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l813)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `A` and an integer `K`. You need to split the array into `K` non-empty continuous subarrays to maximize the sum of the averages of each subarray.

Return the largest sum of averages. 

### Example:

```
Input: A = [9,1,2,3,9], K = 3
Output: 20.0
Explanation:
The best choice is to split into [9], [1, 2, 3], [9]. 
So the result is 9 + (1+2+3)/3 + 9 = 20.
```

### Note:

1. `1 <= A.length <= 100`.
2. `1 <= A[i] <= 10000`.
3. `1 <= K <= A.length`.
4. The answer will be calculated within the range of a decimal number.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. Is the division of subarrays required to be contiguous?
   - Yes, they must be contiguous subarrays.
2. Should the result be rounded to a particular number of decimal places?
   - No, just return the result as a floating-point number.

## Strategy:

1. **Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach:** 
   - Let's use a DP table `dp[i][k]` where `dp[i][k]` represents the maximum sum of averages we can get by partitioning the first `i` elements into `k` parts.
   - Define `prefixSum[i]` as the sum of the first `i` elements of array `A`.
   - The relation can be derived as follows:
     - For every possible last partition ending at `j` (where `j < i`), we calculate the sum of averages as: `dp[i][k] = max(dp[i][k], dp[j][k-1] + avg(j+1, i))`.
     - Here, `avg(j+1, i) = (prefixSum[i] - prefixSum[j]) / (i - j)`.
   - We initialize the DP array such that `dp[i][1]` represents the average of the first `i` elements.

## Code:

```java
public class Solution {
    public double largestSumOfAverages(int[] A, int K) {
        int N = A.length;
        double[] prefixSum = new double[N+1];
        for (int i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            prefixSum[i+1] = prefixSum[i] + A[i];
        }

        double[][] dp = new double[N+1][K+1];
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
            dp[i][1] = prefixSum[i] / i;
        }
        
        for (int k = 2; k <= K; k++) {
            for (int i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
                for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                    dp[i][k] = Math.max(dp[i][k], dp[j][k-1] + (prefixSum[i] - prefixSum[j]) / (i - j));
                }
            }
        }
        
        return dp[N][K];
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:

- The time complexity is `O(N^2 * K)`:
  - There are `N*K` states to fill in the DP table.
  - Each state (`dp[i][k]`) takes `O(N)` time to compute the maximum.
- Space Complexity:
  - The space complexity is `O(N*K)` for the `dp` array and `O(N)` for the `prefixSum` array.
