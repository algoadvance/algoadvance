[Leetcode 117. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l117)
## Problem Statement

You are given a binary tree where each node has the following structure:

```java
public class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node left;
    public Node right;
    public Node next;

    public Node() {}
    
    public Node(int _val) {
        val = _val;
    }
    
    public Node(int _val, Node _left, Node _right, Node _next) {
        val = _val;
        left = _left;
        right = _right;
        next = _next;
    }
}
```

Populate each `next` pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the `next` pointer should be set to `null`.

Initially, all `next` pointers are set to `NULL`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Does the input binary tree have any constraints? For example, is it a perfect binary tree?
   - No, it is not necessarily a perfect binary tree; it's a general binary tree.
  
2. Can we use additional memory for this operation, or should it be done in-place?
   - The problem doesn't restrict the use of additional memory explicitly, but an in-place solution is preferred to optimize for space complexity.

3. Is the tree empty (i.e., the root node is `null`) a valid input?
   - Yes, the tree can be empty, and in that case, the output should also be `null`.

## Strategy

1. Use a level-order traversal (BFS) to connect the `next` pointers on each level.
2. Use a dummy node for each level to manage the connections smoothly.
3. Keep track of the current level's nodes using a pointer and link their children appropriately.

## Code

```java
class Solution {
    public Node connect(Node root) {
        if (root == null) {
            return null;
        }
        
        Node current = root;
        Node dummy = new Node(0); // Dummy node for each level
        Node tail = dummy; // Tail pointer for the current level list
        
        while (current != null) {
            if (current.left != null) {
                tail.next = current.left;
                tail = tail.next;
            }
            if (current.right != null) {
                tail.next = current.right;
                tail = tail.next;
            }
            current = current.next;
            if (current == null) {
                current = dummy.next;
                dummy.next = null;
                tail = dummy;
            }
        }
        
        return root;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the binary tree. The algorithm processes each node exactly once.
  
- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) for the dummy and tail pointers, not including the recursion stack. Since we're doing it in place and not using extra space proportional to the number of nodes, it's considered \(O(1)\) space complexity.
