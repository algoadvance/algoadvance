[Leetcode 2360. Longest Cycle in a Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2360)
### Problem Statement

You are given a directed graph of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1`, where each node has exactly one outgoing edge.

The graph is represented with a given 0-indexed array `edges` of size `n`, indicating that there is a directed edge from node `i` to node `edges[i]`. However, the graph may contain self-loops or multiple edges.

Find the length of the longest cycle in the graph. If no cycle is present, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is it guaranteed that `edges` will contain valid indices for the nodes?** 
   - Yes, every entry in `edges` is guaranteed to be a valid index from `0` to `n - 1`.
  
2. **Can the graph have only a single node with an edge to itself (self-loop)?**
   - Yes, a self-loop is a valid cycle, and its length would be 1.

3. **Is the graph always connected?**
   - No, the graph may not be connected, and some nodes might not be reachable from others.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - We will use an array `visited` to mark nodes that have been fully explored.
   - An array `inStack` to mark nodes currently in the recursion stack to help detect cycles.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS):**
   - Perform a DFS to find cycles. If we encounter a node that is already in the recursion stack, it implies a cycle.
   - Track the cycle length during the detection.

3. **Cycle Detection and Length Calculation:**
   - Keep track of the start node and length of the current path.
   - By using different states in arrays, avoid revisiting nodes unnecessarily.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int longestCycle(int[] edges) {
        int n = edges.length;
        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        int[] inStack = new int[n]; // 0: not visited, 1: visiting, 2: visited
        int[] distance = new int[n]; // track distance from the start node in the DFS
        
        int maxLength = -1;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (visited[i]) continue;
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, dfs(i, edges, visited, inStack, distance, 0));
        }

        return maxLength;
    }

    private int dfs(int node, int[] edges, boolean[] visited, int[] inStack, int[] distance, int currentDist) {
        if (inStack[node] == 1) {
            // Cycle found
            return currentDist - distance[node];
        }
        if (inStack[node] == 2) {
            // Already fully processed node, no need to revisit
            return -1;
        }

        inStack[node] = 1;
        distance[node] = currentDist;
        
        int nextNode = edges[node];
        int maxLength = dfs(nextNode, edges, visited, inStack, distance, currentDist + 1);
        
        inStack[node] = 2;
        visited[node] = true;
        
        return maxLength;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] edges = {3,3,4,2,3}; 
        System.out.println(sol.longestCycle(edges)); // Output: 3
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes. Each node is visited at most twice (once going down and once coming up).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for the depth of the recursion stack, and O(3n) for the visited, inStack, and distance arrays.

By following this approach, we ensure that we correctly identify the longest cycle in any given directed graph as specified in the problem statement.
