[Leetcode 1074. Number of Submatrices That Sum to Target](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1074)
### Problem Statement

You are given a `matrix` and a `target`, and you need to return the number of non-empty submatrices that sum to `target`.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: matrix = [[0,1,0],[1,1,1],[0,1,0]], target = 0
Output: 4
Explanation: The four 1x1 submatrices that sum to 0 are:
- matrix[0:1][0:1]
- matrix[1:2][1:2]
- matrix[2:3][0:1]
- matrix[2:3][2:3]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What are the maximum dimensions of the matrix?
    - Are all elements of the matrix integers?
2. **Output Specification:**
    - Do I need to return just the count or the actual submatrices as well?
    
Given no additional input constraints, we will assume:
- Matrix dimensions can be up to `100 x 100`.
- All elements are integers.
- We only need to return the count of the submatrices.

### Strategy

1. **2D Prefix Sum Calculation:**
    - We can use a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate sums of submatrices. This will allow us to quickly compute the sum of any rectangular submatrix.

2. **Iterate Over All Possible Submatrices:**
    - Use two nested loops to fix the start and end rows of submatrices.
    - For each pair of start and end rows, convert the problem into a 1D problem by summing columns between these two rows.
    - Use hashing (or a dictionary) to store the cumulative sums and count the number of times we have seen a cumulative sum that would indicate a submatrix sum equal to the target.

This approach leverages the idea of reducing a 2D problem to a 1D problem for computational efficiency.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;
import java.util.Map;

public class Solution {
    public int numSubmatrixSumTarget(int[][] matrix, int target) {
        int rows = matrix.length, cols = matrix[0].length;
        int[][] prefixSum = new int[rows + 1][cols + 1];

        // Build prefix sum array
        for (int r = 1; r <= rows; r++) {
            for (int c = 1; c <= cols; c++) {
                prefixSum[r][c] = prefixSum[r - 1][c] + prefixSum[r][c - 1] - prefixSum[r - 1][c - 1] + matrix[r - 1][c - 1];
            }
        }

        int count = 0;
        // Iterate over all possible submatrices
        for (int rowStart = 1; rowStart <= rows; rowStart++) {
            for (int rowEnd = rowStart; rowEnd <= rows; rowEnd++) {
                Map<Integer, Integer> sumMap = new HashMap<>();
                sumMap.put(0, 1); // Initial condition, to account for "prefix sum = target" directly
                for (int col = 1; col <= cols; col++) {
                    int currentSum = prefixSum[rowEnd][col] - prefixSum[rowStart - 1][col];
                    count += sumMap.getOrDefault(currentSum - target, 0);
                    sumMap.put(currentSum, sumMap.getOrDefault(currentSum, 0) + 1);
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[][] matrix = {
            {0, 1, 0},
            {1, 1, 1},
            {0, 1, 0}
        };
        int target = 0;
        System.out.println(sol.numSubmatrixSumTarget(matrix, target)); // Output: 4
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Prefix Sum Calculation:** `O(rows * cols)`
- **Double Loop on Rows and Columns:** The outer loops (rowStart and rowEnd) run in `O(rows^2)`.
- **HashMap Operations for Each Column:** Inside the nested loops, we iterate over all the columns giving an additional complexity of `O(cols)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(rows * cols * rows) = O(rows^2 * cols)`. Given the presumed constraint of `100 x 100` matrix, this approach should work efficiently.
