[Leetcode 934. Shortest Bridge](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l934)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `n x n` binary matrix `grid` where `1` represents land and `0` represents water. An island is a 4-directionally connected group of `1`s.

There are exactly two islands in the `grid`.

You may change `0`s to `1`s to connect the two islands to form one island.

Return the smallest number of `0`s you must flip to connect the two islands.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: grid = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: grid = [[0,1,0],[0,0,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 2
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: grid = [[1,1,1,1,1],[1,0,0,0,1],[1,0,1,0,1],[1,0,0,0,1],[1,1,1,1,1]]
Output: 1
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the grid contain more than two islands? 
   - No, the problem statement guarantees exactly two islands.
2. Do the islands touch each other initially?
   - No, if they touched each other, the solution would be zero.
3. What is the size of the input `grid`?
   - The input grid is square-shaped (n x n), with n being given in the problem constraints.

### Strategy
1. **Identify the two islands:**
   - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to mark all cells of the two islands.
   
2. **Expand one island towards the other:**
   - Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to expand one island cell by cell (flipping `0`s to `1`s) until it reaches the other island. The level of BFS will give the shortest path.

### Code
```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    public int shortestBridge(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[n][n];
        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        
        // Step 1: Find and mark the first island, and add its border cells to the BFS queue
        boolean found = false;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (found) break;
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1) {
                    dfs(grid, visited, queue, i, j);
                    found = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Step 2: Perform BFS from the border cells of the first island to find and reach the second island
        int[] directions = {0, 1, 0, -1, 0};
        int steps = 0;
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int size = queue.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                int[] cell = queue.poll();
                int x = cell[0];
                int y = cell[1];
                for (int d = 0; d < 4; d++) {
                    int nx = x + directions[d];
                    int ny = y + directions[d + 1];
                    if (nx >= 0 && ny >= 0 && nx < n && ny < n && !visited[nx][ny]) {
                        if (grid[nx][ny] == 1) {
                            return steps;
                        }
                        queue.add(new int[]{nx, ny});
                        visited[nx][ny] = true;
                    }
                }
            }
            steps++;
        }
        return -1; // this line should never be reached because there are exactly two islands
    }

    private void dfs(int[][] grid, boolean[][] visited, Queue<int[]> queue, int x, int y) {
        int n = grid.length;
        if (x < 0 || y < 0 || x >= n || y >= n || visited[x][y] || grid[x][y] == 0) {
            return;
        }
        visited[x][y] = true;
        queue.add(new int[]{x, y});
        dfs(grid, visited, queue, x + 1, y);
        dfs(grid, visited, queue, x - 1, y);
        dfs(grid, visited, queue, x, y + 1);
        dfs(grid, visited, queue, x, y - 1);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **DFS marking**: O(n^2) — we traverse all cells to mark the first island.
- **BFS expansion**: O(n^2) — in the worst case, we may need to expand the entire grid.
- **Overall Time Complexity**: O(n^2)

### Space Complexity
- **Visited array**: O(n^2)
- **Queue for BFS**: O(n^2) — in the worst case, it may store all cells of the grid.

**Overall Space Complexity**: O(n^2)

This approach ensures we efficiently find the shortest bridge using a combination of DFS and BFS.
