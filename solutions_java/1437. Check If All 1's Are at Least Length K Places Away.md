[Leetcode 1437. Check If All 1's Are at Least Length K Places Away](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1437)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` of 0s and 1s, and an integer `k`. Return `true` if all 1's are at least `k` places away from each other, otherwise return `false`.

### Example

1. Input: `nums = [1,0,0,0,1,0,0,1]`, `k = 2`
   Output: `true`
2. Input: `nums = [1,0,0,1,0,1]`, `k = 2`
   Output: `false`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of inputs**: What are the length constraints on `nums` and `k`?
   - Length of `nums` can range from 2 to 10^5.
   - `k` is a non-negative integer and will be less than or equal to the length of `nums`.

2. **Edge cases**: 
   - Arrays with no 1's or only one 1.
   - Large values of `k` that are greater than the length of `nums`.

### Strategy

1. Initialize a variable `previousIndex` to keep track of the index of the last 1 encountered.
2. Iterate through the `nums` array:
   - For each 1 encountered, check the distance from the `previousIndex`.
   - If the distance is less than `k`, return `false`.
   - Update `previousIndex` to the current index.
3. If the loop completes without any issue, return `true`.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean kLengthApart(int[] nums, int k) {
        int previousIndex = -1; // Initially no 1 encountered
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] == 1) {
                if (previousIndex != -1 && i - previousIndex - 1 < k) {
                    return false; // Distance between the current 1 and the previous 1 is less than k
                }
                previousIndex = i; // Update previousIndex to the current index
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the `nums` array as we have to scan the entire array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a fixed amount of extra space independent of the input size.
