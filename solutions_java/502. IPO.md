[Leetcode 502. IPO](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l502)
## Problem Statement
You are given several projects that you can start with various profits and capital requirements. You are also given an initial capital `W`. Each project requires a certain amount of capital to start, and it provides a certain profit. Your goal is to find the maximum capital you can have after completing exactly `k` projects.

You can choose and start any project, provided you have the required capital. After completing a project, you earn the profit and add it to your capital.

Formally, you are given:
- An integer `k` (the number of projects you can complete),
- An integer `W` (your initial capital),
- Two integer arrays `Profits` and `Capital`, where `Profits[i]` is the profit of the i-th project, and `Capital[i]` is the capital required to start the i-th project.

Return the maximum capital you can accumulate after completing `k` projects.

### Example:
Input:
- `k = 2`
- `W = 0`
- `Profits = [1,2,3]`
- `Capital = [0,1,1]`

Output: 
- `4`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can I choose the same project more than once?**
   - No, each project can only be selected once.
2. **Is the order of completing projects fixed?**
   - No, you can choose any order as long as you meet the capital requirements.
3. **Can there be more projects than `k`?**
   - Yes, and you need to judiciously select the projects to maximize capital.
4. **Can the initial capital `W` be negative?**
   - No, initial capital `W` is guaranteed to be non-negative.

## Strategy
1. **Heap Utilization**:
   - Use a min-heap to keep track of all feasible projects based on capital requirements.
   - Use a max-heap (priority queue) to then select the project with the highest profit that you can start given your current capital.

2. **Steps**:
   - Initialize a min-heap with all projects based on their capital requirement.
   - For `k` iterations:
     - Move all projects from the min-heap to the max-heap that are feasible with current capital.
     - If the max-heap is empty, break the loop.
     - Pop the project with the highest profit from the max-heap and add its profit to the current capital.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If no project is feasible initially, return the initial capital.
   - If `k` is 0, return the initial capital.

## Time Complexity
- Sorting initially takes `O(n log n)` time.
- Inserting elements into heaps and extracting max `k` times is `O(n log n + k log n)`.

## Code

```java
import java.util.PriorityQueue;

public class IPO {
    public int findMaximizedCapital(int k, int W, int[] Profits, int[] Capital) {
        // Min-heap to track projects by their capital requirement
        PriorityQueue<int[]> capitalMinHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> a[0] - b[0]);
        // Max-heap to track feasible projects by their profit
        PriorityQueue<int[]> profitMaxHeap = new PriorityQueue<>((a, b) -> b[1] - a[1]);

        // Add all projects to the min-heap
        for (int i = 0; i < Profits.length; i++) {
            capitalMinHeap.offer(new int[]{Capital[i], Profits[i]});
        }

        // For k projects
        for (int i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            // Move all feasible projects to the max-heap
            while (!capitalMinHeap.isEmpty() && capitalMinHeap.peek()[0] <= W) {
                profitMaxHeap.offer(capitalMinHeap.poll());
            }

            // If no projects are feasible, break out
            if (profitMaxHeap.isEmpty()) {
                break;
            }

            // Take the most profitable project and update capital
            W += profitMaxHeap.poll()[1];
        }

        return W;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        IPO ipo = new IPO();
        int k = 2;
        int W = 0;
        int[] Profits = {1, 2, 3};
        int[] Capital = {0, 1, 1};
        System.out.println(ipo.findMaximizedCapital(k, W, Profits, Capital)); // Output: 4
    }
}
```

This solution efficiently selects projects to maximize the final capital by using two heaps for managing feasible and profitable projects.
