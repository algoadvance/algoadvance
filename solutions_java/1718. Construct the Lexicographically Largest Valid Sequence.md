[Leetcode 1718. Construct the Lexicographically Largest Valid Sequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1718)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, construct a sequence that satisfies all of the following conditions:

1. The sequence is of size `2n - 1`.
2. Every integer from `1` to `n` will appear exactly two times.
3. The first occurrence of the integer `i` is followed by another `i` exactly `i` positions to the right.
4. The sequence is the lexicographically largest valid sequence possible.

Return the constructed sequence.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the range of `n`?
     - Typically, `n` would be between 1 and 20 given the problem constraints on computational limits.

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Should the sequence be returned as an array?
     - Yes, it should be returned as an array of integers.

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize an array `sequence` of size `2n - 1` with all elements set to `0` to indicate unassigned positions.

2. **Backtracking Approach**:
   - Create a function that attempts to place numbers from `n` to `1` in a backtracking manner.
   - For a given number `i`, look for a position `k` in the array such that both `k` and `k + i` are unassigned.
   - Place the number `i` at both positions `k` and `k + i`.
   - Recursively attempt to place the next number down to `1`.
   - If placing the next number fails, backtrack by removing the number `i` and continue trying the next position.

3. **Lexicographically Largest Sequence**:
   - Always attempt to place the largest number first to ensure that the sequence remains the largest possible lexicographically.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] constructDistancedSequence(int n) {
        int[] sequence = new int[2 * n - 1];
        boolean[] used = new boolean[n + 1];
        if (backtrack(sequence, used, n, 0)) {
            return sequence;
        }
        return new int[0];
    }

    private boolean backtrack(int[] sequence, boolean[] used, int n, int idx) {
        if (idx == sequence.length) {
            return true;
        }

        if (sequence[idx] != 0) {
            return backtrack(sequence, used, n, idx + 1);
        }

        for (int num = n; num > 0; num--) {
            if (used[num]) {
                continue;
            }

            int secondPos = (num == 1) ? idx : idx + num;
            if (secondPos < sequence.length && sequence[idx] == 0 && sequence[secondPos] == 0) {
                sequence[idx] = num;
                sequence[secondPos] = num;
                used[num] = true;

                if (backtrack(sequence, used, n, idx + 1)) {
                    return true;
                }

                sequence[idx] = 0;
                sequence[secondPos] = 0;
                used[num] = false;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the backtracking approach is generally complex to analyze exactly, but we can reason about it as follows:

- In the worst case, each decision (choosing a number to place) can lead to `n` possibilities to evaluate.
- This implies a complexity of `O(n!)` in the worst case due to evaluating all permutations in the backtracking algorithm.

However, we employ early exits (pruning) wherever sequences are infeasible, reducing the actual complexity experienced in practice.
