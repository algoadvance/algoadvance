[Leetcode 1932. Merge BSTs to Create Single BST](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1932)
### Problem Statement

You're given the roots of `n` binary search trees. Each binary search tree is guaranteed to satisfy these properties:
- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the node's value.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with values greater than the node's value.
- Both left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

The task is to merge these `n` BSTs into a single BST. If it's not possible to merge them into a single valid BST, return `null`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the tree nodes' values guaranteed to be unique among all trees?**
    - Yes, each tree node value is unique across all BSTs provided.

2. **What should we return if it's not possible to merge into a single BST?**
    - Return `null` if the trees cannot be merged into a single valid BST.

3. **What is the definition of merging trees?**
    - Merging trees means combining all the given BSTs together while maintaining the Binary Search Tree properties.

### Strategy

1. **Check Base Scenarios:**
    - If there’s only one BST, return it as the result without any modifications.

2. **Inorder Traversal:**
    - Extract all nodes from each BST using an inorder traversal to ensure they are processed in a sorted order.

3. **Combine Nodes:**
    - Combine nodes from all BSTs into one large sorted list.

4. **Construct the BST:**
    - Use the sorted list of nodes to construct a new BST.

5. **Grand Check:**
    - Ensure that the newly constructed tree is a valid BST, considering the original nodes.

### Implementation

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

class TreeNode {
    int val;
    TreeNode left;
    TreeNode right;
    TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
}

public class Solution {
    // Helper function to perform inorder traversal and collect all nodes
    private void inorderTraversal(TreeNode root, List<TreeNode> nodes) {
        if (root == null) return;
        inorderTraversal(root.left, nodes);
        nodes.add(root);
        inorderTraversal(root.right, nodes);
    }

    // Function to merge BSTs
    public TreeNode canMerge(List<TreeNode> trees) {
        // Special case checks
        if (trees == null || trees.size() == 0) return null;
        if (trees.size() == 1) return trees.get(0);

        // Collect all nodes via in-order traversal
        List<TreeNode> nodes = new ArrayList<>();
        for (TreeNode tree : trees) {
            inorderTraversal(tree, nodes);
        }

        // Sort nodes by value - this step relies on the input being correct as per the problem statement
        nodes.sort((a, b) -> a.val - b.val);
        
        // Use the sorted nodes to build the BST
        return sortedListToBST(nodes, 0, nodes.size() - 1);
    }

    // Helper function to convert sorted linked list to BST
    private TreeNode sortedListToBST(List<TreeNode> nodes, int start, int end) {
        if (start > end) return null;
        
        int mid = (start + end) / 2;
        TreeNode node = nodes.get(mid);
        
        node.left = sortedListToBST(nodes, start, mid - 1);
        node.right = sortedListToBST(nodes, mid + 1, end);
        
        return node;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Inorder Traversal**: Each tree traversal takes O(m) time where `m` is the number of nodes in that particular tree. If there are `n` trees, the total time will be O(m1 + m2 + ... + mn) where `m1`, `m2`, ..., `mn` are the number of nodes in respective trees. In the worst-case scenario, it’s O(N) where `N` is the total number of nodes in all BSTs.
- **Sorting**: Sorting the nodes requires O(N log N) time.
- **Building BST**: Converting the sorted list into a BST takes linear time, O(N).

Combining these, the overall time complexity is O(N log N) due to the sorting step, which dominates the traversal and construction steps.
