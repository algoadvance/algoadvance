[Leetcode 2203. Minimum Weighted Subgraph With the Required Paths](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2203)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n` (the number of nodes) and a 2D array `edges` where `edges[i] = [from_i, to_i, weight_i]` represents a directed, weighted edge from node `from_i` to node `to_i` of weight `weight_i`.

You are also given three integers `src1`, `src2`, and `dest`, representing three distinct nodes.

Find the minimum weight of a subgraph G with the required paths:

1. From `src1` to `dest`
2. From `src2` to `dest`

You need to find the minimum sum of the weights of these paths. If no such subgraph exists, return -1.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can edges have negative weights?
2. Can there be multiple edges between two nodes?
3. Are all nodes and edges guaranteed to fit in the graph (node count and edges within reasonable operational limits)?
4. If there are no valid paths from `src1` to `dest` or `src2` to `dest`, should the function return -1?

## Strategy

To tackle this problem, we can:

1. Use Dijkstra's algorithm or use Bellman-Ford if negative weights can be present, for finding the shortest path from `src1` to all other nodes, from `src2` to all other nodes, and from `dest` to all other nodes (using reversed edges).
2. Calculate the minimum weighted path from `src1` to `dest` as sum of two subpaths: `src1` to a common meeting point and the meeting point to `dest`.
3. Do the same for `src2` to `dest`.

Here's the approach broken down step-by-step:

1. Compute the shortest paths from `src1` to all nodes, store these distances.
2. Compute the shortest paths from `src2` to all nodes, store these distances.
3. Reverse all edges and compute the shortest paths from `dest` to all nodes, store these distances.
4. For every possible node, compute the total path weight as the sum of the three distances from above steps.
5. The minimum of these sums will be our answer, if any valid path exists; otherwise, return -1.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    class Node {
        int vertex, weight;

        // Constructor for Node
        public Node(int vertex, int weight) {
            this.vertex = vertex;
            this.weight = weight;
        }
    }

    public long[] dijkstra(List<List<Node>> graph, int start, int n) {
        long[] dist = new long[n];
        Arrays.fill(dist, Long.MAX_VALUE);
        dist[start] = 0;

        PriorityQueue<Node> pq = new PriorityQueue<>(Comparator.comparingLong(node -> node.weight));
        pq.add(new Node(start, 0));

        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            Node current = pq.poll();
            if (current.weight > dist[current.vertex]) continue;
            for (Node neighbor : graph.get(current.vertex)) {
                long newDist = dist[current.vertex] + neighbor.weight;
                if (newDist < dist[neighbor.vertex]) {
                    dist[neighbor.vertex] = newDist;
                    pq.add(new Node(neighbor.vertex, (int)newDist));
                }
            }
        }
        return dist;
    }

    public long minimumWeight(int n, int[][] edges, int src1, int src2, int dest) {
        List<List<Node>> graph = new ArrayList<>();
        List<List<Node>> reverseGraph = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            graph.add(new ArrayList<>());
            reverseGraph.add(new ArrayList<>());
        }
        
        for (int[] edge : edges) {
            int u = edge[0], v = edge[1], w = edge[2];
            graph.get(u).add(new Node(v, w));
            reverseGraph.get(v).add(new Node(u, w));
        }

        long[] distFromSrc1 = dijkstra(graph, src1, n);
        long[] distFromSrc2 = dijkstra(graph, src2, n);
        long[] distToDest = dijkstra(reverseGraph, dest, n);

        long minWeight = Long.MAX_VALUE;
        for (int i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if (distFromSrc1[i] == Long.MAX_VALUE || distFromSrc2[i] == Long.MAX_VALUE || distToDest[i] == Long.MAX_VALUE) {
                continue;
            }
            long totalDist = distFromSrc1[i] + distFromSrc2[i] + distToDest[i];
            minWeight = Math.min(minWeight, totalDist);
        }

        return minWeight == Long.MAX_VALUE ? -1 : minWeight;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of Dijkstra's algorithm for each node is \(O(E \log V)\), where \(E\) is the number of edges and \(V\) is the number of vertices. Since we run the Dijkstra algorithm three times, the overall time complexity remains \(O(3E \log V) = O(E \log V)\).

If edges have negative weights, Bellman-Ford would have been used with a time complexity of \(O(VE)\). But given our current implementation, Dijkstra suffices and is more efficient for non-negative weights.
