[Leetcode 341. Flatten Nested List Iterator](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l341)
### Problem Statement

You are given a nested list of integers `NestedInteger`. Implement an iterator to flatten it.

Each element is either an integer, or a list -- whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

Implement the `NestedIterator` class:

- `NestedIterator(List<NestedInteger> nestedList)` Initializes the iterator with the nested list `nestedList`.
- `int next()` Returns the next integer in the nested list.
- `boolean hasNext()` Returns `true` if there are still some integers in the nested list and `false` otherwise.

Your code should implement the `Iterator` interface in Java.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Is the `NestedInteger` class provided?
   - Yes, the `NestedInteger` class is provided and you don't need to implement it. The methods that it provides are:
     - `boolean isInteger()` - returns `true` if this `NestedInteger` holds a single integer.
     - `Integer getInteger()` - returns the single integer that this `NestedInteger` holds.
     - `List<NestedInteger> getList()` - returns the nested list that this `NestedInteger` holds.

2. Can the nested lists contain empty lists?
   - Yes, the nested lists can contain empty lists.

3. What should happen if the iterator is called for `next` when `hasNext` is false?
   - Normally, it should throw a `NoSuchElementException` or indicate error in some manner typical for iterators.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Use a stack to keep track of the iterators over the nested lists. Each element of the stack will be an iterator over the current list being processed.
   
2. **Flattening Process:**
   - In the `hasNext` method, we need to ensure that the top of the stack contains the next integer to be returned. If the top of the stack points to a nested list, we need to drill down and push iterators for deeper lists onto the stack until we reach an integer or exhaust the list.
   
3. **Next Element Retrieval:**
   - In the `next` method, if `hasNext` confirms that there is an element, we return the integer pointed to by the top of the stack and advance the iterator.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the `NestedIterator` class:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class NestedIterator implements Iterator<Integer> {
    private Stack<Iterator<NestedInteger>> stack;
    private Integer nextInt;

    public NestedIterator(List<NestedInteger> nestedList) {
        stack = new Stack<>();
        stack.push(nestedList.iterator());
    }

    @Override
    public Integer next() {
        if (hasNext()) {
            Integer res = nextInt;
            nextInt = null;
            return res;
        }
        return null; // Or throw NoSuchElementException
    }

    @Override
    public boolean hasNext() {
        while (!stack.isEmpty()) {
            if (!stack.peek().hasNext()) {
                stack.pop();
            } else {
                NestedInteger curr = stack.peek().next();
                if (curr.isInteger()) {
                    nextInt = curr.getInteger();
                    return true;
                } else {
                    stack.push(curr.getList().iterator());
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
}

class NestedInteger {
    // This is a sample implementation. You don't need to implement it.
    public boolean isInteger() {
        // Implementation provided by LeetCode
        return false;
    }
  
    public Integer getInteger() {
        // Implementation provided by LeetCode
        return null;
    }
  
    public List<NestedInteger> getList() {
        // Implementation provided by LeetCode
        return null;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Next Operation (`next`):** `O(1)` once `hasNext` confirms the presence of the next integer.
- **Checking for Next (`hasNext`):** Amortized `O(1)`. In the worst case, it may have to delve through many nested lists, but each element is processed exactly once due to stack operations.
  
This implementation balances efficiency with clear stack-based processing to handle nested iterators effectively.
