[Leetcode 42. Trapping Rain Water](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l42)
## Problem Statement

Given `n` non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: height = [0,1,0,2,1,0,1,3,2,1,2,1]
Output: 6
Explanation: The map looks like this:
     |
 |   | | |
_|_ |_|_||_|
After raining, water is trapped between the bars in these sections:
     ▓
 |   |▓|▓|
_|_ ▓|_|▓||_|
6 units of water are trapped.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: height = [4,2,0,3,2,5]
Output: 9
Explanation: The map looks like this:
   |       |
|_ | _ _| _|
After raining, water is trapped between the bars in these sections:
   ▓       |
|▓ | ▓▓|▓ |
9 units of water are trapped.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the height of the bars be zero or negative?**
   - The height is always non-negative as per the problem statement.
   
2. **What is the range of `n` (number of bars)?**
   - Typically a few thousand, constrained by typical array length limits in Java. For this exercise, assume `1 <= height.length <= 20,000`.

3. **Is there an upper limit to the height of the bars?**
   - Usually, height is reasonably small, but it can be up to typical integer max limit in Java (i.e., `2^31 - 1`).

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a two-pointer approach:

1. **Initialize two pointers:** 
   - `left` at the beginning and `right` at the end of the array.
   
2. **Track left and right maximum heights:**
   - `left_max` and `right_max` to store the maximum heights encountered from the left and right directions respectively.

3. **Move the pointers inward:**
   - Compare the heights at the `left` and `right` pointers.
   - If the height at `left` is less than or equal to height at `right`, move the `left` pointer inward.
     - Update `left_max` and calculate possible trapped water at the `left` pointer.
   - Otherwise, move the `right` pointer inward.
     - Update `right_max` and calculate possible trapped water at the `right` pointer.

4. **Continue until the pointers meet:**

This ensures that we are calculating water trapped based on the shorter of the two boundaries, as it must be filled first.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int trap(int[] height) {
        if (height == null || height.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        int left = 0, right = height.length - 1;
        int leftMax = 0, rightMax = 0;
        int trappedWater = 0;
        
        while (left < right) {
            if (height[left] < height[right]) {
                if (height[left] >= leftMax) {
                    leftMax = height[left];
                } else {
                    trappedWater += leftMax - height[left];
                }
                left++;
            } else {
                if (height[right] >= rightMax) {
                    rightMax = height[right];
                } else {
                    trappedWater += rightMax - height[right];
                }
                right--;
            }
        }
        
        return trappedWater;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the height array since we are processing each element at most twice (once with the left pointer, once with the right pointer).
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`. Only a fixed amount of extra space is used.

This algorithm efficiently calculates the trapped water with minimal space, making it well-suited for large inputs.
