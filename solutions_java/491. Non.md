[Leetcode 491. Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l491)
### Problem Statement:

Given an integer array `nums`, return all the different possible non-decreasing subsequences of the given array with at least two elements. You may return the answer in any order.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Can elements in the subsequence be repeated?**
   - Yes, the elements can be repeated.

2. **Do we need to check for strictly increasing subsequences only?**
   - No, the subsequence should be non-decreasing, which means it can contain duplicates but always in non-decreasing order.

3. **Are there any constraints on the length of the input array?**
   - Yes, 1 <= nums.length <= 15 and -100 <= nums[i] <= 100.

4. **How are the results supposed to be returned?**
   - As a list of lists, where each list is a non-decreasing subsequence.

### Strategy:

1. **Backtracking:** This approach is suitable because it allows us to explore all possible subsequences and make decisions at each step.
   - We'll use a helper function that will recursively build subsequences.
   - Use a set to avoid duplicate subsequences.

2. **Use Parameters Efficiently:**
   - Start with an empty list to accumulate the current subsequence.
   - Use an index to track the next position to consider in the array.

3. **Base Case:**
   - If the accumulating list has at least two elements, add it to the result set.

4. **Recursive Case:**
   - Iterate through the remaining array elements.
   - If an element can be appended to the current subsequence (to maintain the non-decreasing property), make a recursive call with the updated list and index.
   - Skip duplicate elements in the same recursive level to avoid redundant work.

### Code:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public List<List<Integer>> findSubsequences(int[] nums) {
        Set<List<Integer>> result = new HashSet<>();
        List<Integer> tempList = new ArrayList<>();
        backtrack(result, tempList, nums, 0);
        return new ArrayList<>(result);
    }

    private void backtrack(Set<List<Integer>> result, List<Integer> tempList, int[] nums, int start) {
        if (tempList.size() >= 2) {
            result.add(new ArrayList<>(tempList));
        }

        for (int i = start; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (tempList.isEmpty() || nums[i] >= tempList.get(tempList.size() - 1)) {
                tempList.add(nums[i]);
                backtrack(result, tempList, nums, i + 1);
                tempList.remove(tempList.size() - 1);
            }
        }
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {4, 6, 7, 7};
        System.out.println(solution.findSubsequences(nums));
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** `O(2^n)`, where `n` is the length of the input array. For each element, we decide to include it in the current subsequence or not, which leads to exponential combinations.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n * 2^n)` for storing the subsequences and for the recursion stack.

This solution efficiently finds all non-decreasing subsequences by exploring all potential subsequences through a backtracking approach. The usage of a set ensures that duplicate subsequences are filtered out.
