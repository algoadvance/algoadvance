[Leetcode 2193. Minimum Number of Moves to Make Palindrome](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2193)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. You need to determine the minimum number of moves required to transform `s` into a palindrome. In one move, you can choose any two adjacent characters of `s` and swap them.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**
   - Is the length of the string `s` limited?  
     - Yes, the length of `s` is between 1 and 1000.
   
2. **Output Details**
   - Should the function return the minimum number of moves?
     - Yes, the function should return an integer representing the minimum number of moves.

### Strategy

To transform the string `s` into a palindrome with the minimum number of adjacent swaps, we can employ a greedy approach with two pointers. Hereâ€™s the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Two-pointer approach**:
   - Set up two pointers, `left` at the start of the string and `right` at the end of the string.
   - While the `left` pointer is less than the `right` pointer:
     - Check if `s[left]` is equal to `s[right]`.
     - If they are equal, move both pointers inward (`left++` and `right--`).
     - If `s[left]` is not equal to `s[right]`, we need to find the smallest number of swaps to make them equal:
       - Find the position from the `left` index where `s[left]` can swap with characters towards the `right`.
       - Similarly, find the position from the `right` index where `s[right]` can swap with characters towards the `left`.
       - Execute the minimal number of swaps needed and adjust the string accordingly.

2. **Helper Functions**:
   - **Swap Function**: A helper function to execute adjacent swaps in the string.

By following this approach, we ensure that each step iterates closer towards making the string a palindrome with minimal swaps.

### Code Implementation

Here is the Java code to solve the problem:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minMovesToMakePalindrome(String s) {
        char[] arr = s.toCharArray();
        int moves = 0;
        int left = 0, right = arr.length - 1;

        while (left < right) {
            if (arr[left] == arr[right]) {
                left++;
                right--;
            } else {
                int l = left, r = right;
                while (l < r && arr[l] != arr[right]) l++;
                while (r > l && arr[r] != arr[left]) r--;
                if (l == right) {
                    // Single character case, swap left and left+1, then reprocess
                    swap(arr, left, left + 1);
                    moves++;
                } else if (r == left) {
                    // Single character case, swap right and right-1, then reprocess
                    swap(arr, right, right - 1);
                    moves++;
                } else {
                    // Regular case: move the smaller swap count
                    if (left - l < r - right) {
                        for (int i = l; i > left; i--) {
                            swap(arr, i, i - 1);
                            moves++;
                        }
                        left++;
                        right--;
                    } else {
                        for (int i = r; i < right; i++) {
                            swap(arr, i, i + 1);
                            moves++;
                        }
                        left++;
                        right--;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return moves;
    }

    private void swap(char[] arr, int i, int j) {
        char temp = arr[i];
        arr[i] = arr[j];
        arr[j] = temp;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        String s = "aabb";
        System.out.println(sol.minMovesToMakePalindrome(s)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where `n` is the length of the string. In the worst case, for each character, you might need to perform up to `n` swaps.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), mainly due to the character array used for swapping operations.

This implementation should be efficient given the problem constraints.
