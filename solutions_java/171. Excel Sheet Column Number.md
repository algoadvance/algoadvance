[Leetcode 171. Excel Sheet Column Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l171)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `columnTitle` that represents the column title as appear in an Excel sheet. For example:

- "A" -> 1
- "B" -> 2
- ...
- "Z" -> 26
- "AA" -> 27
- "AB" -> 28 
- ...

You need to return its corresponding column number.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: columnTitle = "A"
Output: 1
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: columnTitle = "AB"
Output: 28
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: columnTitle = "ZY"
Output: 701
```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= columnTitle.length <= 7`
- `columnTitle` consists only of uppercase English letters.
- `columnTitle` is in the range ["A", "FXSHRXW"].

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q:** Should the result be an integer that matches the Excel column numbering system?
   **A:** Yes.

2. **Q:** Are there any special characters in `columnTitle`?
   **A:** No, `columnTitle` consists only of uppercase English letters.

3. **Q:** Can the input be an empty string?
   **A:** No, the constraints ensure that `columnTitle.length` is at least 1.

## Strategy:

- Each letter in the string represents a digit in a 26-base number.
- The letter 'A' corresponds to 1, 'B' to 2, ..., 'Z' to 26.
- We can convert the column title to a number similarly to how we convert a string representing a decimal number to an integer.
  
To convert each character in `columnTitle` into its corresponding number:
- Calculate its value relative to 'A' (i.e., `value = character - 'A' + 1`).
- Multiply the current result by 26 (since it's a base-26 number) and add the value of the current character.

This can be visualized with the example "AB":
- For 'A': Value is `1`. Initial result is `0`, so `0 * 26 + 1 = 1`.
- For 'B': Value is `2`. Current result is `1`, so `1 * 26 + 2 = 28`.

## Code:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int titleToNumber(String columnTitle) {
        int result = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < columnTitle.length(); i++) {
            char c = columnTitle.charAt(i);
            int value = c - 'A' + 1;
            result = result * 26 + value;
        }
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        // Test cases
        System.out.println(sol.titleToNumber("A")); // 1
        System.out.println(sol.titleToNumber("AB")); // 28
        System.out.println(sol.titleToNumber("ZY")); // 701
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:

The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the length of the `columnTitle` string. This is because we are processing each character in the string exactly once.
