[Leetcode 1863. Sum of All Subset XOR Totals](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1863)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, find the sum of all XOR totals for every subset of `nums`. The XOR total of a subset is defined as the bitwise XOR of all its elements if the subset is not empty.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:** What is the range of values for the elements in the `nums` array?
   - Elements in `nums` are non-negative integers and the length of `nums` is between 1 and 12.
2. **Output Constraints:** Are there any specific format requirements for the output?
   - The output should be a single integer which is the sum of XOR values of all subsets.
3. **Edge Cases:** 
   - What should be returned if the input array contains only one element? 
     - The XOR value would be the element itself.

### Strategy
1. **Generate All Subsets:** Use backtracking to generate all possible subsets of `nums`.
2. **Calculate XOR Total:** For each subset, calculate its XOR total (skip empty subsets).
3. **Sum XOR Totals:** Sum up the XOR totals of all subsets.
4. **Optimization Insight:** Since each element appears in exactly half of the generated subsets given any input of length `n`, we can simplify the computation.

### Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public int subsetXORSum(int[] nums) {
        List<Integer> currentSubset = new ArrayList<>();
        return backtrack(nums, currentSubset, 0);
    }

    private int backtrack(int[] nums, List<Integer> currentSubset, int index) {
        if (index == nums.length) {
            // Calculate the XOR total for the current subset (excluding empty subset)
            if (currentSubset.isEmpty()) return 0;
            int xorTotal = 0;
            for (int num : currentSubset) {
                xorTotal ^= num;
            }
            return xorTotal;
        }
        // Include the current element
        currentSubset.add(nums[index]);
        int include = backtrack(nums, currentSubset, index + 1);
        currentSubset.remove(currentSubset.size() - 1);
        
        // Exclude the current element
        int exclude = backtrack(nums, currentSubset, index + 1);
        
        return include + exclude;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {1, 3};
        System.out.println(sol.subsetXORSum(nums));  // Output: 6
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this backtracking solution is exponential, **O(2^n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the `nums` array. This is because we generate all possible subsets (which is `2^n` subsets). In practice, given `nums` array length constraints (1 ≤ n ≤ 12), this exponential time complexity is manageable.
