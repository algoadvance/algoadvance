[Leetcode 2472. Maximum Number of Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2472)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You need to find the maximum number of non-overlapping palindromic substrings of `s` that have a length of at least `k`.

Return an integer representing the maximum number of non-overlapping palindromic substrings.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**
   - What is the maximum possible length of the string `s`? This will help in understanding the time complexity constraints.
   
2. **Substring Requirements**
   - Can palindromic substrings overlap within themselves?
   - Are all characters in the string lowercase, uppercase, or a mix?

3. **Edge Cases**
   - What should be done if the string length is smaller than `k`?
   - Can the entire string be a palindrome?

## Strategy

1. **Check Palindromes Efficiently**:
   - Use a function to check if a substring is a palindrome.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Initialize a boolean array `dp` to store which substrings are palindromic.
   - Use two loops to fill up the dp array. The outer one for the length of substrings and the inner one for the starting index.

3. **Greedy Approach To Select Substrings**:
   - Iterate through the string and select the longest possible palindromic substring that meets the criteria of non-overlapping and has a length of at least `k`.

4. **Greedy Optimization**:
   - Start from the beginning, find the first k-length palindrome, move to the end of this palindrome, and repeat until the end of the string.

## Time Complexity Analysis

- **Palindrome Checking**: O(n^2) due to the nested loop filling the dp table.
- **Greedy Selection**: O(n) since we traverse the string linearly to select substrings.

Overall, the time complexity is O(n^2).

## Code

```java
public class MaxNonOverlappingPalindromes {
    public int maxPalindromes(String s, int k) {
        int n = s.length();
        boolean[][] dp = new boolean[n][n];
        
        for (int len = 1; len <= n; len++) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - len; i++) {
                int j = i + len - 1;
                if (len == 1) {
                    dp[i][j] = true;
                } else if (len == 2) {
                    dp[i][j] = s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j);
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j) && dp[i+1][j-1];
                }
            }
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < n;) {
            boolean foundPalindrome = false;
            for (int j = i + k - 1; j < n; j++) {
                if (dp[i][j]) {
                    count++;
                    i = j + 1;
                    foundPalindrome = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!foundPalindrome) {
                i++;
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaxNonOverlappingPalindromes solution = new MaxNonOverlappingPalindromes();
        System.out.println(solution.maxPalindromes("abaccddccefe", 3)); // Expected Output: 2
        System.out.println(solution.maxPalindromes("aaaaa", 2));        // Expected Output: 2 (c) 
    }
}
```

**Explanation**:

1. **Palindrome DP Table**:
   - `dp[i][j]` will be `true` if the substring `s[i..j]` is a palindrome.

2. **Greedy Selection**:
   - Iterate through the string from left to right.
   - For each position, find the longest palindromic substring starting at that position with at least length `k`.
   - Update the starting index to the character right after the end of the found palindromic substring to ensure non-overlapping.

3. **Edge Cases Handled**:
   - The code ensures substrings have at least length `k` and it correctly handles the input string whose length is smaller than `k` by not entering the palindrome checking loop.

This solution is efficient and aligns with the problem constraints effectively.
