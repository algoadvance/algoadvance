[Leetcode 1105. Filling Bookcase Shelves](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1105)
### Problem Statement
You are given a list of books where the `i-th` book has a height `books[i][1]` and thickness `books[i][0]`. You want to place these books in order onto bookcase shelves that have a fixed width `shelfWidth`.

You can place books on multiple shelves, but the total thickness of the books on any single shelf must not exceed `shelfWidth`. Additionally, the height of a shelf is defined by the tallest book on that shelf.

You want to minimize the total height of the bookcase.

Write an algorithm to find the minimum possible height of the bookcase.

#### Example:
```
Input: books = [[1, 3], [2, 4], [3, 2]], shelfWidth = 6
Output: 4
Explanation:
The ideal placement is:
- On the first shelf: books with dimensions [1, 3] and [2, 4].
  The height of the shelf is max(3, 4) = 4.
- On the second shelf: book with dimension [3, 2].
  The height of the shelf is 2.
  Total height is 4 + 2 = 6.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the books be rotated?**
   - No, the dimensions are fixed with thickness as the width component and height as the height component.
2. **Can the order of the books be changed?**
   - No, the order of the books should remain as given.
3. **Is there a limit to the number of shelves?**
   - No, the number of shelves can be as many as needed as long as we minimize the total height.

### Strategy

We can use Dynamic Programming (DP) to solve this problem effectively. The essential idea is to keep track of the minimum height for the first `i` books.

1. Let's denote `dp[i]` as the minimum height needed to place the first `i` books.
2. The complexity arises because we have to consider placing each book `i` on the same shelf as the previous book or starting a new shelf.
3. The relation will be as follows:
    - Initialize `dp[0] = 0` since no books mean no height.
    - For each book `i`, we iterate backwards to determine the best possible position to place the book either on the new shelf or continue from the previous shelf.

### Code

Below is the code implementing this strategy:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minHeightShelves(int[][] books, int shelfWidth) {
        int n = books.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        // dp[i] is the minimum height needed to place first i books
        dp[0] = 0;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            int width = 0, height = 0;
            dp[i] = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
            
            for (int j = i; j > 0; j--) {
                width += books[j-1][0];
                if (width > shelfWidth) break;
                height = Math.max(height, books[j-1][1]);
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[j-1] + height);
            }
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(n^2)`, where `n` is the number of books. This arises because for each book `i`, in the worst case, we need to iterate through all previous books to determine the optimal arrangement. The space complexity is `O(n)` for the `dp` array.
