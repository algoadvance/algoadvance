[Leetcode 70. Climbing Stairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l70)
### Problem Statement

You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Function Signature:**
```java
public int climbStairs(int n)
```

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top:
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top:
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints**: 
    - `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45).
2. **Output**: 
    - Return the number of distinct ways to climb to the top.

### Strategy

This problem can be approached using a dynamic programming technique similar to the Fibonacci sequence where:
- `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to reach the `i-th` step.
- To reach step `i`, one could have come from step `i-1` or step `i-2`. Therefore, the relation is:
    \[
    dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2]
    \]
- Base cases:
    - `dp[1] = 1` (one way to climb one step)
    - `dp[2] = 2` (two ways to climb to the second step, i.e., [1step + 1step] or [2 steps])

### Code

Here is the Java code to solve the problem:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n == 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        if (n == 2) {
            return 2;
        }
        
        int[] dp = new int[n + 1];
        dp[1] = 1;
        dp[2] = 2;
        
        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + dp[i - 2];
        }
        
        return dp[n];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\) because we compute the solution in a single pass through the stairs up to `n`.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) because we use an array of size `n + 1` to store the intermediate results. However, we can optimize this to \(O(1)\) by using two variables to store `dp[i - 1]` and `dp[i - 2]` instead of a full array. Here is the optimized version:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n == 1) {
            return 1;
        }
        if (n == 2) {
            return 2;
        }

        int first = 1;
        int second = 2;
        int result = 0;

        for (int i = 3; i <= n; i++) {
            result = first + second;
            first = second;
            second = result;
        }

        return second;
    }
}
```

In the optimized version, the **space complexity** is reduced to \(O(1)\) while maintaining the same \(O(n)\) time complexity.
