[Leetcode 2908. Minimum Sum of Mountain Triplets I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2908)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n`. Your goal is to find three integers in `nums` that satisfy the following conditions:

1. The integers are distinct.
2. They form a mountain sequence such that `a < b > c`.
3. Return the minimum sum of such mountain triplets. If there are no such triplets, return -1.

### Example:
```
Input: nums = [2, 1, 3, 5, 4, 7]
Output: 10
Explanation: The mountain triplet [2, 5, 3] gives the sum as 10.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the integers be non-consecutive in the array?
   - **A:** Yes, the integers do not need to be consecutive. They just need to satisfy the `a < b > c` condition.
2. **Q:** Can the array contain duplicate values?
   - **A:** Yes, the array can contain duplicates, but the integers forming the triplet must be distinct.
3. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the size of the input array?
   - **A:** Standard constraints apply, e.g., `1 <= nums.length <= 1000` and `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`.

## Strategy

To find the minimum sum of mountain triplets:
1. Iterate through the array, considering each element as a potential peak `b`.
2. For each possible peak `b`, find the largest possible `a` to the left of `b` and the largest possible `c` to the right of `b`.
3. Track the minimum sum of any valid triplet found.

### Steps:
1. **Initialization:** Set initial minimum sum to a large value (e.g., `Integer.MAX_VALUE`).
2. **Iterate:** Loop over the array considering each element as the peak of the mountain.
3. **Finding `a` (left of peak):** Use a nested loop to find the largest element less than the peak before the index of the peak.
4. **Finding `c` (right of peak):** Use a nested loop to find the largest element less than the peak after the index of the peak.
5. **Tracking Minimum:** If both `a` and `c` are found, calculate the sum and update the minimum sum.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minimumSumMountainTriplets(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int minSum = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        boolean found = false;
        
        for (int j = 1; j < n - 1; j++) {
            int leftMax = Integer.MIN_VALUE;
            int rightMax = Integer.MIN_VALUE;

            // Look for the largest element to the left of nums[j]
            for (int i = 0; i < j; i++) {
                if (nums[i] < nums[j]) {
                    leftMax = Math.max(leftMax, nums[i]);
                }
            }

            // Look for the largest element to the right of nums[j]
            for (int k = j + 1; k < n; k++) {
                if (nums[k] < nums[j]) {
                    rightMax = Math.max(rightMax, nums[k]);
                }
            }

            if (leftMax != Integer.MIN_VALUE && rightMax != Integer.MIN_VALUE) {
                found = true;
                int currentSum = leftMax + nums[j] + rightMax;
                minSum = Math.min(minSum, currentSum);
            }
        }

        return found ? minSum : -1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {2, 1, 3, 5, 4, 7};
        System.out.println(sol.minimumSumMountainTriplets(nums));  // Output: 10
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

### Analysis:
- We iterate through the array once to pick each possible peak, giving us `O(n)` peaks to consider.
- For each peak, we search left and right, making this a two nested `O(n)` operations for each peak.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n^2)`.

This solution is efficient given the constraints and ensures that all possible peaks are evaluated to find the minimum sum of mountain triplets.
