[Leetcode 2789. Largest Element in an Array after Merge Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2789)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of positive integers `nums`, you are allowed to merge the elements of the array. In each merge operation, we can either choose two adjacent elements and merge them into a single element whose value is their sum or leave an element as it is. The goal is to make the final array have the largest possible single element.

Return the value of the largest element that can be achieved from the given merge operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Are we allowed to merge only a single pair of adjacent elements at one time, or can we merge multiple times in one operation?
   - **A**: You are allowed to merge only one pair of adjacent elements at one time.

2. **Q**: Can the original array have more than two elements?
   - **A**: Yes, the original array can have multiple elements.

3. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the size of the array or the values within it?
   - **A**: This will depend on the problem statement constraints provided on the platform (e.g., LeetCode).

### Strategy

To achieve the largest possible single element, the optimal strategy would be to continually merge elements starting from the largest possible combinations. Summing up all the elements will always be the largest single element you can achieve as every element is positive. 

Follow these steps:

1. Initialize a variable `largest_sum` to 0.
2. Iterate through each element in the array and add the element value to `largest_sum`.
3. Return the `largest_sum` after iterating through all elements.

### Code

Here's a Java implementation to solve the problem:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int largestElementAfterMerge(int[] nums) {
        int largestSum = 0;
        for (int num : nums) {
            largestSum += num;
        }
        return largestSum;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because we need to iterate over each element of the array exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(1) since we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

By following this approach, we ensure that we are always achieving the largest possible single element by continuously summing all elements in the array.
