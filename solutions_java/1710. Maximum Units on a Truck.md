[Leetcode 1710. Maximum Units on a Truck](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1710)
### Problem Statement
You are assigned to put some amount of boxes onto a truck. You are given a 2D array `boxTypes`, where `boxTypes[i] = [numberOfBoxes_i, numberOfUnitsPerBox_i]`:

- `numberOfBoxes_i` is the number of boxes of type `i`.
- `numberOfUnitsPerBox_i` is the number of units in each box of the type `i`.

You are also given an integer `truckSize`, which is the maximum number of boxes that can be put on the truck. You need to maximize the total number of units that can be put on the truck.

**Return the maximum total number of units that can be put on the truck.**

### Example 1
```
Input: boxTypes = [[1,3],[2,2],[3,1]], truckSize = 4
Output: 8
Explanation: 
- Load 1 box of type [1,3] => 3 units.
- Load 2 boxes of type [2,2] => 4 units.
- Load 1 box of type [3,1] => 1 unit.
Total units = 3 + 4 + 1 = 8.
```

### Example 2
```
Input: boxTypes = [[5,10],[2,5],[4,7],[3,9]], truckSize = 10
Output: 91
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. What are the constraints on the input sizes? 
   ```
   Constraints:
   - `1 <= boxTypes.length <= 1000`
   - `1 <= numberOfBoxes_i, numberOfUnitsPerBox_i <= 1000`
   - `1 <= truckSize <= 10^6`
   ```
2. Do we need to consider the order of boxes while loading them onto the truck?
   - No, the order does not matter. You should prioritize loading boxes that have the highest number of units per box to maximize the total units.

### Strategy
Since we want to maximize the number of units, we can use a greedy algorithm:
1. Sort the array `boxTypes` based on the number of units per box in descending order.
2. Iterate through the sorted list and start loading boxes onto the truck:
   - If the truck can take all boxes of the current type, load them and decrement the truck capacity accordingly.
   - If the truck can't take all boxes of the current type, fill the remaining truck space with as many boxes as possible from the current type and stop.

### Time Complexity
- Sorting step: \(O(n \log n)\) where \(n\) is the length of `boxTypes`.
- Iteration step: \(O(n)\)

The overall time complexity would be \(O(n \log n)\).

### Code
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int maximumUnits(int[][] boxTypes, int truckSize) {
        // Step 1: Sort the boxTypes based on units per box in descending order
        Arrays.sort(boxTypes, (a, b) -> b[1] - a[1]);
        
        int maxUnits = 0;
        
        // Step 2: Load the truck with boxes
        for (int[] box : boxTypes) {
            int numberOfBoxes = box[0];
            int unitsPerBox = box[1];
            
            if (truckSize >= numberOfBoxes) {
                // If the truck can take all boxes of this type
                maxUnits += numberOfBoxes * unitsPerBox;
                truckSize -= numberOfBoxes;
            } else {
                // If the truck can only take part of the boxes of this type
                maxUnits += truckSize * unitsPerBox;
                break;
            }
        }
        
        return maxUnits;
    }
}
```

In this approach:
1. We sort the `boxTypes` based on the units per box in descending order.
2. We iterate through the sorted `boxTypes` to fill the truck as much as possible, focusing on the boxes with the most units first.

This ensures that we maximize the number of units loaded onto the truck.
