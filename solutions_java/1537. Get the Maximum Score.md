[Leetcode 1537. Get the Maximum Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1537)
### Problem Statement

You are given two **sorted** arrays of integers `nums1` and `nums2`.

Return the maximum score of a path that starts at `nums1[0]` and ends at either `nums1[nums1.length - 1]` or `nums2[nums2.length - 1]`.

You can only move to the right:

- You may start at either array, but you can only switch from `nums1` to `nums2` or vice versa at common indices.

The score is defined as the sum of the values of the elements visited along the path.

### Example

**Input:**

```plaintext
nums1 = [2,4,5,8,10]
nums2 = [4,6,8,9]
```

**Output:**

```plaintext
30
```

**Explanation:**

```plaintext
One possible path to get the maximum score is to start at `nums1[0]` and move to `nums1[2]`, then move to `nums2[1]` and `nums2[3]`. So the path will be [2,4,5,8,9], and the maximum score is 2 + 4 + 5 + 8 + 9 = 28.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. What should be the length of the arrays `nums1` and `nums2`?
    - The arrays can be of any non-negative length.
   
2. Are the arrays always sorted in ascending order?
    - Yes, the arrays are guaranteed to be sorted in ascending order.

3. Can the arrays contain negative numbers?
    - No, the arrays contain only positive integers.

4. What should be returned if both arrays are empty?
    - Since the problem constraints guarantee one non-empty array, this situation would not arise.

5. Can we assume no duplicates in individual arrays?
    - Yes, each individual array contains all unique elements.

### Strategy

1. We'll use a two-pointer technique to traverse both arrays.
2. We initialize two sums, `sum1` and `sum2`, to accumulate the sums of the paths we are exploring.
3. As we traverse, if both pointers are pointing to the same value (i.e., they intersect), we take the maximum of the sums accumulated up to that point (`sum1` and `sum2`) and add it to the result.
4. Move both pointers forward while adding the corresponding element to their sums.
5. After exiting the loop, add the remaining sums from whichever path was continued till the end.
6. The maximum score will be the maximum path sum encountered.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxSum(int[] nums1, int[] nums2) {
        int i = 0, j = 0;
        long sum1 = 0, sum2 = 0, result = 0;
        int MOD = 1_000_000_007;

        while (i < nums1.length && j < nums2.length) {
            if (nums1[i] < nums2[j]) {
                sum1 += nums1[i++];
            } else if (nums1[i] > nums2[j]) {
                sum2 += nums2[j++];
            } else {
                result += Math.max(sum1, sum2) + nums1[i];
                sum1 = 0;
                sum2 = 0;
                i++;
                j++;
            }
        }

        while (i < nums1.length) {
            sum1 += nums1[i++];
        }

        while (j < nums2.length) {
            sum2 += nums2[j++];
        }

        result += Math.max(sum1, sum2);

        return (int) (result % MOD);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n + m)** where `n` and `m` are the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2`, respectively. This is because we traverse each array once with the two-pointer technique.

- The space complexity is **O(1)** since we only use a fixed amount of extra space for the sum variables and the pointers.
