[Leetcode 766. Toeplitz Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l766)
## Problem Statement

A matrix is called Toeplitz if every diagonal from top-left to bottom-right has the same elements.

Given an `m x n` matrix `matrix`, return `true` if the matrix is Toeplitz. Otherwise, return `false`.

You need to implement the following function:

```java
public boolean isToeplitzMatrix(int[][] matrix);
```

### Example 1:
```
Input:
matrix = [
  [1,2,3,4],
  [5,1,2,3],
  [9,5,1,2]
]

Output: true
Explanation:
In the above grid, the diagonals are:
"[9]", "[5, 5]", "[1, 1, 1]", "[2, 2, 2]", "[3, 3]", "[4]".
In each diagonal all elements are the same, so the answer is True.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input:
matrix = [
  [1,2],
  [2,2]
]

Output: false
Explanation:
The bottom left value is different from the top right value in the diagonal starting from matrix[1][0].
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the size of the matrix?**
   - The matrix dimensions m and n can be any positive integers, including very large numbers.

2. **Are negative numbers allowed in the matrix?**
   - Yes, the matrix can contain negative numbers.

3. **Can the matrix be non-square (i.e., m â‰  n)?**
   - Yes, the matrix can be non-square.

## Strategy

To determine if a matrix is Toeplitz, we need to check if every diagonal from top-left to bottom-right has the same elements. Specifically, for each element at `matrix[i][j]`, we need to ensure that `matrix[i][j] == matrix[i+1][j+1]` (provided `i+1` and `j+1` are within bounds).

### Steps:

1. **Traverse through the matrix:** 
   - Loop through each element up to the second-last row and second-last column since elements in the last row and column won't have corresponding `matrix[i+1][j+1]` to compare.

2. **Check the diagonals:**
   - For each element at `matrix[i][j]`, verify that it is equal to `matrix[i+1][j+1]`.
   - If any discrepancy is found, return `false`.

3. **If no discrepancies are found, return `true`.**

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean isToeplitzMatrix(int[][] matrix) {
        // Iterate over each element except for the last row and last column
        for (int i = 0; i < matrix.length - 1; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < matrix[0].length - 1; j++) {
                // Check if the current element is equal to the element diagonally below it
                if (matrix[i][j] != matrix[i + 1][j + 1]) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(m * n)** where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the matrix. This is because we are iterating through each element of the matrix once.

The space complexity is **O(1)** since we are using a constant amount of extra space.
