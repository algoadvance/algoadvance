### Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 233: **Number of Digit One**

Given an integer `n`, count the total number of digit **1** appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to `n`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 13
Output: 6
Explanation: The digit 1 occurs in 1, 10, 11, 12, 13.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 0
Output: 0
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is `n` always going to be a positive integer?**
    - `n` is a non-negative integer (i.e., it can be 0 as well).
  
2. **Is there any constraint on the values of `n`?**
    - The value of `n` can be quite large, up to `10^9`.

3. **Any specific requirements or restrictions for time complexity?**
    - Given the potential size of `n`, a linear time algorithm may not be optimal. Aim for a more efficient solution possibly logarithmic or sub-linear if achievable.

### Strategy

This problem can be solved with a mathematical approach rather than a naive iteration. The idea is to count the occurrences of the digit '1' by considering each digit place (units, tens, hundreds, etc.) separately.

For each digit place, we consider the numbers that can be formed involving that digit and count how many of them have '1' in the specific position. 

The digit at position `i` affects the count of '1's in three possible ways:
1. It determines how many complete cycles of digit places we've seen.
2. It determines the count of '1's contributed by higher places.
3. It contributes as the current place itself is '1'.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int countDigitOne(int n) {
        if (n < 0) return 0;
        
        long count = 0;
        for (long place = 1; place <= n ; place *= 10) {
            long higherDigits = n / (place * 10);
            long currentDigit = (n / place) % 10;
            long lowerDigits = n % place;
            
            if (currentDigit > 1) {
                count += (higherDigits + 1) * place;
            } else if (currentDigit == 1) {
                count += higherDigits * place + (lowerDigits + 1);
            } else {
                count += higherDigits * place;
            }
        }
        
        return (int) count;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is `O(log10(n))` because the loop runs once for each digit in the number `n`. For instance, if `n` is a 10-digit number, the loop will run 10 times. Consequently, this method is efficient and suitable for large values such as `n = 10^9`.

### Conclusion

This solution efficiently counts the number of digit '1' in all numbers from 0 to `n` by breaking the problem down into manageable parts and considering each digit's place value contribution separately. This approach ensures that the problem is solved in logarithmic time with respect to the number of digits in `n`.
