[Leetcode 212. Word Search II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l212)
### Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` board of characters and a list of strings words, return all words on the board that exist in the list. A word is defined as a sequence of characters formed by the letters on the board. The same letter cell may not be used more than once in a word.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can words overlap on the board?** 
   - Words can share letters and cells, but during the search for a single word, each cell can be used only once.
   
2. **Are there constraints on the length of words?**
   - No specific constraints in the problem, but the length should be reasonable to fit within the `m x n` dimensions of the board.

3. **Can the board contain any characters?**
   - Yes, the board can contain any characters as the problem does not restrict to any specific set of characters.

4. **Are all words unique in the input list?**
   - The problem does not specify, but we will assume words can be repeated and we need to ensure our result contains no duplicates.

5. **What should be returned if no words are found?**
   - An empty list should be returned if no words are found.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the following approach:
1. Build a Trie (prefix tree) from the list of words to allow fast prefix checking.
2. Use Depth-First Search (DFS) on each cell of the board to explore possible words.
3. Keep track of visited cells to avoid revisiting them within a single search path.
4. Collect words that are found and ensure they are listed without duplicates.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

class Solution {
    class TrieNode {
        TrieNode[] children = new TrieNode[26];
        String word = null;
    }

    private TrieNode buildTrie(String[] words) {
        TrieNode root = new TrieNode();
        for (String word : words) {
            TrieNode node = root;
            for (char c : word.toCharArray()) {
                int index = c - 'a';
                if (node.children[index] == null) {
                    node.children[index] = new TrieNode();
                }
                node = node.children[index];
            }
            node.word = word;
        }
        return root;
    }

    public List<String> findWords(char[][] board, String[] words) {
        TrieNode root = buildTrie(words);
        Set<String> result = new HashSet<>();
        int m = board.length;
        int n = board[0].length;

        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                dfs(board, i, j, root, result);
            }
        }

        return new ArrayList<>(result);
    }

    private void dfs(char[][] board, int i, int j, TrieNode node, Set<String> result) {
        char c = board[i][j];
        if (c == '#' || node.children[c - 'a'] == null) return;
        node = node.children[c - 'a'];
        if (node.word != null) {
            result.add(node.word); // Found a word
        }

        board[i][j] = '#'; // Mark as visited
        if (i > 0) dfs(board, i - 1, j, node, result);
        if (j > 0) dfs(board, i, j - 1, node, result);
        if (i < board.length - 1) dfs(board, i + 1, j, node, result);
        if (j < board[0].length - 1) dfs(board, i, j + 1, node, result);
        board[i][j] = c; // Unmark
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Trie Construction**: O(N * M), where N is the number of words and M is the length of the longest word.
- **DFS Traversal**: O(M * N * 3^L), where M is the number of rows, N is the number of columns, and L is the average length of the words. Each cell can lead to 3 possible next steps (left, right, down, up).

Thus, the combined time complexity is dominated by the DFS search: **O(M * N * 3^L)**.
