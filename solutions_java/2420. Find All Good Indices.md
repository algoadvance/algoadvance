[Leetcode 2420. Find All Good Indices](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2420)
### Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` of size `n` and a positive integer `k`.

We call an index `i` in the range `k <= i < n - k` a good index if the following conditions are satisfied:

- The `k` elements that are just before the index `i` are in non-increasing order.
- The `k` elements that are just after the index `i` are in non-decreasing order.

Return *an array of all good indices sorted in increasing order*.

Example 1:
- Input: `nums = [2,1,1,1,3,4,1], k = 2`
- Output: `[2,3]`
Explanation: There are two good indices we can consider:
  - For index 2, the subarray `[2,1]` is non-increasing and the subarray `[1,3]` is non-decreasing.
  - For index 3, the subarray `[1,1]` is non-increasing and the subarray `[3,4]` is non-decreasing.

Example 2:
- Input: `nums = [2,1,1,2], k = 1`
- Output: `[2]`
Explanation: There is one good index we can consider:
  - For index 2, the subarray `[1]` is non-increasing and the subarray `[1]` is non-decreasing.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What should the function return if there are no good indices?
   - Return an empty array in such a case.

2. What are the boundary values of `n` and `k`?
   - `1 <= k < n <= 10^5`
   - `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`

3. Are all values in the array guaranteed to be integers?
   - Yes, as per constraints.

### Strategy
1. **Initialization**: We need to find the good indices in `nums` such that the previous `k` elements are non-increasing and the next `k` elements are non-decreasing.

2. **Subarray Checks**:
   - Use two arrays `nonInc` and `nonDec` where `nonInc[i]` is `true` if subarray ending at `i` and of length `k` is non-increasing and likewise `nonDec[i]` is `true` if subarray starting at `i` and of length `k` is non-decreasing.

3. **Populating Arrays**:
   - For `nonInc`, iterate through the `nums` array and check the order of elements.
   - For `nonDec`, iterate through the `nums` array in reverse.

4. **Result Collection**: 
   - Check the `nonInc` and `nonDec` arrays to collect the indices which satisfy the condition of being `good`.

5. Time Complexity should be **O(n)** as we will be doing linear scans to populate `nonInc` and `nonDec` arrays.

### Code
Here is the implementation based on the above strategy:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> goodIndices(int[] nums, int k) {
        int n = nums.length;
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>();
        
        if (n < 2 * k + 1) return result;
        
        // Create arrays to store if a subarray is non-increasing or non-decreasing
        boolean[] nonInc = new boolean[n];
        boolean[] nonDec = new boolean[n];
        
        // Populate nonInc array
        for (int i = k; i < n; i++) {
            boolean isNonInc = true;
            for (int j = i - k + 1; j < i; j++) {
                if (nums[j] > nums[j - 1]) {
                    isNonInc = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            nonInc[i] = isNonInc;
        }
        
        // Populate nonDec array
        for (int i = 0; i < n - k; i++) {
            boolean isNonDec = true;
            for (int j = i + 1; j < i + k; j++) {
                if (nums[j] < nums[j - 1]) {
                    isNonDec = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            nonDec[i] = isNonDec;
        }
        
        // Check for good indices
        for (int i = k; i < n - k; i++) {
            if (nonInc[i] && nonDec[i]) {
                result.add(i);
            }
        }
        
        return result;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **O(n)**: We traverse the array multiple times linearly, ensuring we stay within O(n) complexity.

### Space Complexity
- **O(n)**: For storing the `nonInc` and `nonDec` arrays.
