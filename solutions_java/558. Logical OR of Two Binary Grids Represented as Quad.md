[Leetcode 558. Logical OR of Two Binary Grids Represented as Quad](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l558)
## Problem Statement

**LeetCode 558: Logical OR of Two Binary Grids Represented as Quad-Trees**

A Binary Grid is represented as a quad-tree. This problem involves computing the logical OR of two binary grids, which are given in the form of two quad-trees, and returning the resulting quad-tree.

A node in the quad-tree is represented as follows:
```java
class Node {
    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;
}
```
- `val` is the value of the node, which applies only if the node is a leaf (`isLeaf` is `true`).
- If the node is a leaf node, the value represents the value of that position in the grid (either `0` or `1`).
- If the node is not a leaf, it has four children representing its four quadrants.

We are required to merge two quad-trees by logical OR operation. Return the resulting quad-tree.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can a node be entirely `0` or `1`?**
   - Yes, if a node is a leaf, it will have `val=0` or `val=1`.
  
2. **How should non-leaf nodes be represented in the result?**
   - Non-leaf nodes will be represented by merging their children respectively with a logical OR operation.

3. **What should we do if one tree is a leaf and the other is not?**
   - If the tree with the leaf has `val=1`, the result will be the leaf node with `val=1`. If `val=0`, the result is the other tree structure.

## Strategy

The strategy to solve this problem is by doing a recursive operation to merge the quad-trees:

1. If `t1` or `t2` (either of the input trees) is a leaf node:
   - If it is `1`, return `t1` or `t2` (since OR `any` with `1` is `1`).
   - If it is `0`, return the other tree (since OR with `0` will be the other value).

2. If both nodes are not leaves, recursively merge their children nodes.

3. Combine the results of the children nodes into a new node. If all resultant children nodes are leaf nodes with the same value, flatten them to a single leaf node.

### Code

```java
class Node {
    public boolean val;
    public boolean isLeaf;
    public Node topLeft;
    public Node topRight;
    public Node bottomLeft;
    public Node bottomRight;

    public Node() {}

    public Node(boolean val, boolean isLeaf) {
        this.val = val;
        this.isLeaf = isLeaf;
    }

    public Node(boolean val, boolean isLeaf, Node topLeft, Node topRight, Node bottomLeft, Node bottomRight) {
        this.val = val;
        this.isLeaf = isLeaf;
        this.topLeft = topLeft;
        this.topRight = topRight;
        this.bottomLeft = bottomLeft;
        this.bottomRight = bottomRight;
    }
}

public class Solution {
    public Node intersect(Node t1, Node t2) {
        if (t1.isLeaf) {
            if (t1.val) return t1;
            else return t2;
        }
        if (t2.isLeaf) {
            if (t2.val) return t2;
            else return t1;
        }

        Node topLeft = intersect(t1.topLeft, t2.topLeft);
        Node topRight = intersect(t1.topRight, t2.topRight);
        Node bottomLeft = intersect(t1.bottomLeft, t2.bottomLeft);
        Node bottomRight = intersect(t1.bottomRight, t2.bottomRight);

        if (topLeft.isLeaf && topRight.isLeaf && bottomLeft.isLeaf && bottomRight.isLeaf &&
            topLeft.val == topRight.val && topRight.val == bottomLeft.val && bottomLeft.val == bottomRight.val) {
            return new Node(topLeft.val, true);
        }

        return new Node(false, false, topLeft, topRight, bottomLeft, bottomRight);
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is `O(min(n1, n2))`, where `n1` and `n2` are the number of nodes in the two input quad-trees. In the worst case, we'll need to traverse all nodes of the smaller tree to merge both trees.
