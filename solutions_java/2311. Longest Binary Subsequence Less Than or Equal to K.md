[Leetcode 2311. Longest Binary Subsequence Less Than or Equal to K full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2311)
### Problem Statement:

You are given a binary string `s` and a positive integer `k`. You want to find the length of the longest subsequence that can be obtained from `s` such that the binary value of the subsequence is less than or equal to `k`.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Types**:
   - Binary string `s` only contains characters `'0'` and `'1'`.
   - Integer `k` is a positive integer.
   
2. **Subsequence Rules**:
   - A subsequence of a string is a sequence that can be derived from another string by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
   
3. **Constraints**:
   - Does `s` have length constraints?
   - How large can `k` be?

### Strategy:

To solve this problem, we can employ a greedy approach:

1. **Initialize Count**:
   - Start by counting all the `'0'`s in the string `s` since any combination of `'0'`s will always give a value of `0`, which is less than or equal to any k.

2. **Process 1's Efficiently**:
   - To maximize the subsequence length, try to keep the maximum number of `'0'`s and carefully select `'1'`s.
   - Start from the least significant bit (right side of the string) to the most significant bit as this ensures that smaller binary numbers are created first.
   
3. **Maintain Valid Subsequence**:
   - The subsequence value should always be less than or equal to `k`. If so, continue adding `'1'`s only if it doesn't lead to exceeding `k`.

By using this approach, we ensure that we maximize the length of the subsequence while keeping its value within the specified limit.

### Code:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int longestSubsequence(String s, int k) {
        int len = s.length();
        int countZeros = 0;
        int subseqValue = 0;
        int weight = 1;
        int onesAdded = 0;
        
        // Count all zeros first as we can take all zeros without increasing the value
        for (char ch : s.toCharArray()) {
            if (ch == '0') {
                countZeros++;
            }
        }
        
        // Adding '1's from the right (least significant side)
        for (int i = len - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == '1') {
                if (subseqValue + weight <= k) {
                    subseqValue += weight;
                    onesAdded++;
                }
                weight <<= 1; // Move to the next bit place (weight doubles)
                
                if (subseqValue > k) {
                    weight >>= 1;  // If subseqValue exceeds k, rollback to previous weight
                    subseqValue -= weight;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return countZeros + onesAdded;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Initialization**: Counting zeros takes O(n).
- **Processing '1's**: Traversing from the end to the beginning also takes O(n).
- **Overall Complexity**: The overall complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`.

By following this strategy, we maximize the length of the binary subsequence while ensuring its value does not exceed `k`.
