[Leetcode 2564. Substring XOR Queries](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2564)
## Problem Statement

You are given a binary string `s`, a number of queries, and each query contains two integers `L` and `R`. For each query, you need to determine if there exists a substring of `s` from index `L` to `R` (inclusive) such that the XOR of all the characters of that substring is equal to 0. If such a substring exists, you need to return `yes`, otherwise, return `no`.

**Example:**
```java
Input: s = "110100110"
Queries: [[1, 4], [0, 2], [3, 7]]
Output: ["yes", "no", "yes"]

Explanation:
Query 1: Substring from index 1 to 4 is "1010" which has XOR = 1^0^1^0 = 0
Query 2: Substring from index 0 to 2 is "110" which has XOR = 1^1^0 = 0
Query 3: Substring from index 3 to 7 is "10011" which has XOR = 1^0^0^1^1 = 1
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the indices in the queries 0-based or 1-based?**
   - Assume 0-based indexing.

2. **Do we need to consider any special characters in the string or only binary characters ('0' and '1')?**
   - The string contains only binary characters ('0' and '1').

3. **What is the expected number of queries?** 
   - This information is not specified, so assume the number of queries can be large.

4. **Specify any constraints on the size of the string `s` and the number of queries?**
   - Assume the length of `s` and the number of queries are moderate to fit within typical memory and processing time limits for coding interview problems.

## Strategy

1. **Compute prefix XOR array:**
   - We can compute the XOR from the beginning of the string up to any index `i` in O(1) time using a prefix XOR array.
   
2. **Use prefix XOR to calculate range XOR:**
   - The XOR of any substring from `L` to `R` can be calculated using the property of XOR: 
     \[
     \text{XOR}(L, R) = \text{prefixXOR}[R+1] \oplus \text{prefixXOR}[L]
     \]
   
3. **Check for each query:**
   - Use the prefix XOR to quickly determine if the XOR of the substring for the given range is zero.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class SubstringXORQueries {
    public static List<String> substringXORQueries(String s, int[][] queries) {
        int n = s.length();
        int[] prefixXOR = new int[n + 1];
        
        // Compute prefix XOR
        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            prefixXOR[i] = prefixXOR[i - 1] ^ (s.charAt(i - 1) - '0');
        }
        
        List<String> results = new ArrayList<>();
        
        // Process each query
        for (int[] query : queries) {
            int L = query[0];
            int R = query[1];
            int rangeXOR = prefixXOR[R + 1] ^ prefixXOR[L];
            
            if (rangeXOR == 0) {
                results.add("yes");
            } else {
                results.add("no");
            }
        }
        
        return results;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        String s = "110100110";
        int[][] queries = {{1, 4}, {0, 2}, {3, 7}};
        List<String> results = substringXORQueries(s, queries);
        
        for (String result : results) {
            System.out.println(result);
        }
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing (Prefix XOR computation):** O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- **Query Processing:** O(1) for each query since we're using precomputed prefix XOR.
- **Total Complexity:** O(n + q), where `q` is the number of queries. 

This approach ensures efficient processing for each query, leveraging the prefix XOR array to perform constant-time checks for the XOR value of any given substring.
