[Leetcode 2746. Decremental String Concatenation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2746)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of strings `words`, you need to concatenate all the strings in a specific order such that the overall length of the resultant string is minimized. You can reorder the strings. The operation allowed on the strings is:

1. For any two strings `a` and `b`, you can concatenate `a` and `b` as `a` + `b` or `b` + `a`. 

You need to return the minimum length possible of the resultant concatenated string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum length of each string in `words`?**
   - Each string in the words array is not longer than 100 characters.
2. **What is the maximum number of strings in `words`?**
   - There can be up to 500 strings in the array.
3. **Is it guaranteed that the array `words` will have at least one string?**
   - Yes, the array will contain at least one string.

### Strategy

The problem focuses on minimizing the length of the concatenated string formed by the given words. The key is to find the optimal order of words while performing concatenation.

A dynamic programming approach combined with bit-masking may be suitable to efficiently determine the minimum length for all configurations of the given words.

#### Dynamic Programming and Bitmasking Approach:

1. **State Definition**:
   - Use a DP array `dp` where `dp[mask][i]` represents the minimum length of content ending with the `i-th` word and with a bitmask `mask` that represents the set of included words.

2. **Transition**:
   - For each valid state `(mask, i)` where `mask` includes the `i-th` word, try to extend the sequence by adding another word `j`, considering all possible overlappings.

3. **Overlap Calculation**:
   - Precompute an array `overlap[i][j]` which captures the length when `words[i]` is concatenated with `words[j]` taking the overlap into account.

4. **Initialization and Final State**:
   - Initialize `dp[1 << i][i]` to the length of `words[i]` for all `i`.
   - The answer will be the minimum `dp[all-words-mask][i]` where `all-words-mask` includes all words.

### Code

Here's the implementation in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minLengthWordConcatenation(String[] words) {
        int n = words.length;
        int[][] overlap = new int[n][n];

        // Calculate overlap[i][j]
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i != j) {
                    overlap[i][j] = calculateOverlap(words[i], words[j]);
                }
            }
        }

        // DP: dp[mask][i] = minimum length ending with words[i] and mask is the set
        int[][] dp = new int[1 << n][n];

        for (int mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
            Arrays.fill(dp[mask], Integer.MAX_VALUE);
        }

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[1 << i][i] = words[i].length();
        }

        for (int mask = 1; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
            for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if ((mask & (1 << i)) != 0) {
                    for (int j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                        if ((mask & (1 << j)) == 0) {
                            int nextMask = mask | (1 << j);
                            dp[nextMask][j] = Math.min(dp[nextMask][j],
                                    dp[mask][i] + words[j].length() - overlap[i][j]);
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        int minLen = Integer.MAX_VALUE;
        int allWordsMask = (1 << n) - 1;

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            minLen = Math.min(minLen, dp[allWordsMask][i]);
        }

        return minLen;
    }

    private int calculateOverlap(String a, String b) {
        int maxOverlap = 0;
        int lenA = a.length(), lenB = b.length();
        for (int i = 1; i <= Math.min(lenA, lenB); i++) {
            if (a.substring(lenA - i).equals(b.substring(0, i))) {
                maxOverlap = i;
            }
        }
        return maxOverlap;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Overlap Calculation**: \(O(n^2 \cdot \text{max\_len}^2)\) for calculating overlaps where `n` is the number of words and `max_len` is the maximum length of a word.
2. **DP Table Calculation**: \(O(n^2 \cdot 2^n)\), as we are processing all \(2^n\) combinations and for each combination, we are considering transitions between `n` words.

Hence, the overall time complexity is dominated by \(O(n^2 \cdot 2^n)\), which is feasible given the constraints (up to 500 words).
