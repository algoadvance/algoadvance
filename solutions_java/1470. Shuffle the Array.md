[Leetcode 1470. Shuffle the Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1470)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` consisting of `2n` elements in the form `[x1, x2, ..., xn, y1, y2, ..., yn]`.

You need to return the array in the form `[x1, y1, x2, y2, ..., xn, yn]`.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [2,5,1,3,4,7], n = 3
Output: [2,3,5,4,1,7] 
``` 

The elements in the `nums` array should be rearranged such that elements from `x` and `y` are interleaved.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Validation:** Can we assume that the input will always be valid as per the problem description?
2. **Data Range:** Are there any constraints on the size of the elements in the array, or is it limited to the fact that the array will have 2n elements?
3. **Edge Cases:** Are there any special cases we should consider, such as `n` being zero?

### Strategy
1. **Input Validation:** We assume the input is valid and `nums` has exactly `2n` elements. If `n` is provided but not properly constrained, checks could be added.
2. **Array Formation:** Initialize a result array of size `2n`.
3. **Interleaving:** Use a loop to place elements from each half of the input array into the result array alternately.

### Code
Let's implement the solution in Java:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int[] shuffle(int[] nums, int n) {
        int[] result = new int[2 * n];
        int j = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            result[j++] = nums[i];
            result[j++] = nums[i + n];
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {2,5,1,3,4,7};
        int n = 3;
        int[] shuffled = sol.shuffle(nums, n);
        for (int num : shuffled) {
            System.out.print(num + " ");
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this solution is:
- **O(n)**: We traverse the array once to form the result array.

### Explanation
1. **Initialization:** We create an array `result` of length `2n` to store the shuffled elements.
2. **Looping through the array:**
   - For each index `i` from `0` to `n-1`, we place the `i`th element from the first half of `nums` and the `i`th element from the second half of `nums` alternately into `result`.
3. **Returning the result:** The resultant array `result` is returned which has elements in the required shuffled order.
