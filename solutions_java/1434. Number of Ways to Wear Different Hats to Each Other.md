[Leetcode 1434. Number of Ways to Wear Different Hats to Each Other](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1434)
### Problem Statement

There are `n` people and `40` different hats labeled from `1` to `40`. Each person has a list of hats that they like. The goal is to find the number of ways to assign different hats to each person such that each person gets exactly one hat they like. 

Given a `List<List<Integer>> hats` where `hats[i]` is a list of all hats liked by the i-th person, return the number of ways to assign different hats to each person. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are there constraints regarding the number of people `n`?
    - Yes, typically `1 ≤ n ≤ 10`.

2. Can a hat be assigned to more than one person?
    - No, each hat can only be assigned to one person.

3. Is it possible that some people may not like any hats or each person must like at least one hat?
    - The input will ensure that each person likes at least one hat as per typical problem constraints.

### Strategy

1. **Model the Problem:**
    - We need to map hats to people. Given that `n` is at most `10`, a bitmask DP approach is suitable.
  
2. **State Representation:**
    - Use `dp[mask]` to represent the number of ways to assign hats to the subset of people indicated by `mask`.
    
3. **Initialization:**
    - Start with `dp[0] = 1` indicating one way to assign hats to an empty set of people.
    
4. **Transition:**
    - Iterate over each hat and consider assigning it to a person who likes it and hasn't been assigned another hat yet.

5. **Final Solution:**
    - The final solution will be the value in `dp[(1 << n) - 1]` indicating that all people have been assigned a hat.

### Code

```java
import java.util.List;
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;

public class NumberOfWaysToWearDifferentHatsToEachOther {
    public int numberWays(List<List<Integer>> hats) {
        int MOD = 1000000007;
        int n = hats.size();

        // dp[mask] means the number of ways to assign hats to the subset of people indicated by mask
        int[] dp = new int[1 << n];
        dp[0] = 1;

        // Array hatsPeople mapping hat to people who like it
        List<Integer>[] hatsPeople = new ArrayList[41];
        for (int i = 0; i <= 40; i++) {
            hatsPeople[i] = new ArrayList<>();
        }

        // Fill the hatsPeople array
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int hat : hats.get(i)) {
                hatsPeople[hat].add(i);
            }
        }

        // Iterate over each hat
        for (int hat = 1; hat <= 40; hat++) {
            // Traverse in reverse order to avoid using the same hat twice in the same iteration
            for (int mask = (1 << n) - 1; mask >= 0; mask--) {
                // If dp[mask] > 0, try to give hat to any person who likes it
                for (int person : hatsPeople[hat]) {
                    if ((mask & (1 << person)) == 0) {  // Check if the person doesn't have a hat yet
                        dp[mask | (1 << person)] = (dp[mask | (1 << person)] + dp[mask]) % MOD;
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[(1 << n) - 1];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        NumberOfWaysToWearDifferentHatsToEachOther solution = new NumberOfWaysToWearDifferentHatsToEachOther();
        List<List<Integer>> hats = Arrays.asList(
            Arrays.asList(3, 4),
            Arrays.asList(4, 5),
            Arrays.asList(5)
        );
        System.out.println(solution.numberWays(hats)); // Output should match the problem example
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization:** O(40*n) to fill the `hatsPeople` structure.
- **DP Computation:** Each hat is iterated over all possible bitmasks `(1 << n)` times and, in the worst case, tries to update each subset state. The loop runs O(40 * 2^n * n).
- **Final Complexity:** Given n ≤ 10, the overall complexity is effectively O(40 * 2^10 * 10) which is manageable within the constraints.

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is primarily O(2^n) for the DP array and auxiliary structures used in the computation.
