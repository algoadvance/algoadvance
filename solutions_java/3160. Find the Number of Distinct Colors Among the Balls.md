[Leetcode 3160. Find the Number of Distinct Colors Among the Balls](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3160)
### Problem Statement

Given `N` balls where each ball has a specific color represented by an integer, write a function to find the number of distinct colors among the balls. You are provided with an array where each element represents the color of the ball.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for the colors?**
   - The colors are represented by integers. The range should be large enough to accommodate all integers that an int type in Java can hold.

2. **Can there be negative values?**
   - Typically, colors are positive integers, but for completeness, we should be prepared to handle negative integers as well.

3. **Is there a possibility of an empty array?**
   - Yes, the array could be empty, in which case, the output should be 0.

4. **What is the size constraint for the array?**
   - This needs confirmation from the interviewer, but letâ€™s assume it fits within the memory limits and processing capabilities of our environment.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, the set data structure is very useful here. Sets automatically handle duplicates, so by inserting all the ball colors into a set, we end up with only the unique colors.

### Steps:

1. Initialize an empty set.
2. Iterate through each ball color in the array and add it to the set.
3. The size of the set at the end of the iteration will give the number of distinct colors.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of balls. This is because we need to iterate through the entire array once and adding elements to a set is on average O(1).
- **Space Complexity:** O(N) in the worst case, where all colors are distinct.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.Set;

public class DistinctColors {
    public int findNumberOfDistinctColors(int[] colors) {
        Set<Integer> distinctColors = new HashSet<>();
        
        for (int color : colors) {
            distinctColors.add(color);
        }
        
        return distinctColors.size();
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        DistinctColors solution = new DistinctColors();
        
        // Test cases
        int[] colors1 = {1, 1, 2, 3, 2};
        System.out.println(solution.findNumberOfDistinctColors(colors1)); // Output: 3
        
        int[] colors2 = {};
        System.out.println(solution.findNumberOfDistinctColors(colors2)); // Output: 0
        
        int[] colors3 = {5, 5, 5, 5, 5};
        System.out.println(solution.findNumberOfDistinctColors(colors3)); // Output: 1
        
        int[] colors4 = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6};
        System.out.println(solution.findNumberOfDistinctColors(colors4)); // Output: 6
    }
}
```
