[Leetcode 1953. Maximum Number of Weeks for Which You Can Work](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1953)
## Problem Statement

Let’s define the problem:

You are given an array of positive integers `milestones` where each integer represents the number of units of work required for a particular project. Each week, you must choose exactly one project to work on. The condition is that no two consecutive weeks can be spent on the same project. Your goal is to find the maximum number of weeks you can work on given these constraints.

Formally, return the maximum number of weeks for which you can work on the projects.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: Is there a constraint on the size of the `milestones` array?
2. **Output Type**: Should the result be returned as an integer representing the maximum number of weeks?
3. **Edge Cases**: How should the program handle cases where all or one of the values in `milestones` are equal? 

For now, I’ll assume a reasonable constraint on input size, typical for programming contest problems (`milestones` might contain up to `10^5` elements), the result is an integer, and we handle cases where projects have similar or dissimilar milestones efficiently.

## Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public long numberOfWeeks(int[] milestones) {
        long totalSum = 0;
        int maxMilestone = 0;

        for (int milestone : milestones) {
            totalSum += milestone;
            if (milestone > maxMilestone) {
                maxMilestone = milestone;
            }
        }

        long remainingSum = totalSum - maxMilestone;
        
        // If the max milestone is greater than the sum of the rest + 1, return 2 * (remainingSum + 1), else return totalSum
        // `remainingSum + 1` means alternating milestones until the second last week, and the last week on the max milestone
        if (maxMilestone > remainingSum + 1) {
            return 2 * remainingSum + 1;
        } else {
            return totalSum;
        }
    }
}
```

## Strategy

To solve this problem, the main insight is to ensure that the largest milestone doesn't overly dominate the workload distribution because no two consecutive weeks should have work on the same project:

1. **Sum Calculation**: Compute the total sum of all milestones.
2. **Maximum Milestone**: Determine the maximum value in the milestones array.
3. **Remaining Sum**: Compute the sum of the remaining milestones by subtracting the max milestone from the total sum.
4. **Comparison**:
    - If the `maxMilestone` is greater than `remainingSum` plus one, it means that it isn’t realistically possible to alternate without repeating the maximum milestone. In such cases, only alternations can be done until the remaining milestones are exhausted.
    - Otherwise, we can distribute the milestones evenly since it’s possible to alternate without consecutive repetitions.

## Time Complexity

1. **Finding the total sum**: O(n) where n is the length of the `milestones` array.
2. **Finding the maximum milestone**: O(n).

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**, which is efficient for the constraints presumed.
