[Leetcode 1218. Longest Arithmetic Subsequence of Given Difference](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1218)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `arr` and an integer `difference`, return the length of the longest subsequence in `arr` which is an arithmetic sequence such that the difference between consecutive elements in the subsequence is equal to `difference`.

### Example 1:
- **Input:** arr = [1,2,3,4], difference = 1
- **Output:** 4
- **Explanation:** The longest arithmetic subsequence is [1, 2, 3, 4].

### Example 2:
- **Input:** arr = [1,3,5,7], difference = 1
- **Output:** 1
- **Explanation:** The longest arithmetic subsequence is any single element since the difference 1 is not present.

### Example 3:
- **Input:** arr = [1,5,7,8,5,3,4,2,1], difference = -2
- **Output:** 4
- **Explanation:** The longest arithmetic subsequence is [7, 5, 3, 1].

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is it guaranteed that the input array will not be empty?**
   - Yes, the problem constraints imply that there will be at least one element in the array.

2. **What is the range of the elements in the array and the difference?**
   - The elements in the array and the difference can be any integer within a reasonable constraint typical of competitive programming problems (e.g., in the range of -10^4 to 10^4 for the array elements and difference).

## Strategy

1. **Use a HashMap:** We'll use a hashmap to store the length of the longest arithmetic subsequence ending at each element.
2. **Iterate through the Array:** For each element `a` in the array:
   - Compute the previous element in the arithmetic progression: `prev = a - difference`.
   - Check if `prev` is already in the hashmap.
   - Update the hashmap entry for `a` to be one more than the entry for `prev`.
3. **Track the Maximum Length:** Throughout this process, keep track of the maximum length of all subsequences found.

This approach ensures we efficiently compute the desired result in linear time.

## Code

```java
import java.util.HashMap;

public class Solution {
    public int longestSubsequence(int[] arr, int difference) {
        // HashMap to store the length of longest subsequence ending with value 'a'
        HashMap<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        int maxLength = 0;

        for (int num : arr) {
            // Compute the length of the subsequence ending with `num`
            int sequenceLength = map.getOrDefault(num - difference, 0) + 1;
            // Update the map with the new length for `num`
            map.put(num, sequenceLength);
            // Update the maxLength if necessary
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, sequenceLength);
        }

        return maxLength;
    }

    // Main method for running example cases
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        
        System.out.println(sol.longestSubsequence(new int[]{1,2,3,4}, 1));  // Output: 4
        System.out.println(sol.longestSubsequence(new int[]{1,3,5,7}, 1));  // Output: 1
        System.out.println(sol.longestSubsequence(new int[]{1,5,7,8,5,3,4,2,1}, -2));  // Output: 4
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the number of elements in the array, since we process each element exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` in the worst case, for storing the hashmap values.

This solution is efficient for large arrays and provides the correct output as required by the problem statement.
