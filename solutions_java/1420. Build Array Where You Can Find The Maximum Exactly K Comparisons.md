[Leetcode 1420. Build Array Where You Can Find The Maximum Exactly K Comparisons](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1420)
### Problem Statement

You are given three integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. You need to build an array `arr` of length `n` such that:

1. Each element of the array is an integer within the range `[1, m]`.
2. The array must have exactly `k` "segments". A segment is defined as a contiguous subarray having the maximum element of that subarray appearing at the first position in that segment.

Return the number of ways to build the array. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: What exactly is a "segment"?
   **A**: A segment refers to a contiguous subarray where the first element of the subarray is the maximum element of that subarray. For example, in the array `[7, 5, 4, 6, 1, 7, 2]`, possible segments are `[7, 5, 4]` and `[7, 2]`.

2. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the values of `n`, `m`, and `k`?
   **A**: Typically, for such problems, `n`, `m`, and `k` will fit within typical integer range constraints (`1 <= k <= n <= 50` and `1 <= m <= 100` are usual constraints to consider).

3. **Q**: Do we need to consider leading/trailing zeros or empty arrays?
   **A**: No, the problem guarantees well-formed arrays as per the constraints.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Use a DP table `dp[i][j][u]` where `i` is the length of the array considered, `j` is the number of segments considered, and `u` is the maximum value used so far.
   - Initialize the table with base cases and use nested loops to build up the solution.
   - The DP state transitions will depend on whether you are starting a new segment or continuing within a segment.

### Code

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    private static final int MOD = 1000000007;

    public int numOfArrays(int n, int m, int k) {
        // dp[i][j][u] will be our state table
        // i - length of array
        // j - number of segments
        // u - max element used so far
        int[][][] dp = new int[n + 1][k + 1][m + 1];

        // Initialize the dp table
        for (int i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= k; j++) {
                Arrays.fill(dp[i][j], 0);
            }
        }

        // Base case: length = 0 results in one solution with 0 segments
        dp[0][0][0] = 1;

        for (int len = 1; len <= n; len++) {
            for (int seg = 1; seg <= k; seg++) {
                for (int maxVal = 1; maxVal <= m; maxVal++) {
                    // Case 1: Continue with the same segment
                    dp[len][seg][maxVal] = (dp[len][seg][maxVal] + dp[len - 1][seg][maxVal] * maxVal) % MOD;
                    
                    // Case 2: Start a new segment with maxVal as the new maximum
                    for (int prevMax = 0; prevMax < maxVal; prevMax++) {
                        dp[len][seg][maxVal] = (dp[len][seg][maxVal] + dp[len - 1][seg - 1][prevMax]) % MOD;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        int result = 0;
        for (int maxVal = 1; maxVal <= m; maxVal++) {
            result = (result + dp[n][k][maxVal]) % MOD;
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.numOfArrays(2, 3, 1)); // Example test case
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this dynamic programming approach can be analyzed as follows:

- **Loop 1**: Iterate over array length `n` — `O(n)`
- **Loop 2**: Iterate over number of segments `k` — `O(k)`
- **Loop 3**: Iterate over maximum value `m` — `O(m)`
- **Loop 4**: Iterate over previous maximum value — `O(m)`

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n * k * m * m)`, which should be manageable given typical constraints.
