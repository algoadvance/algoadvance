[Leetcode 1034. Coloring A Border](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1034)
### Problem Statement:
You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `grid`, and three integers `row`, `col`, and `color`. Each value in the grid represents the color of the grid cell.

The border of an `m x n` grid is composed of all cells in the first row, the first column, the last row, and the last column. A connected component of `grid` is a set of grid cells such that any cell in the set is connected to any other cell in the set directly or indirectly through adjacent cells (i.e., the cells below, above, left, or right of the cell).

The connected component of the cell at the position `(row, col)` and all the cells in the same connected component are said to be "border" cells if they touch the border of the grid or their component is not fully surrounded by only one distinct color on all side.

You need to color all the border cells of the connected component with the given `color`, and then return the final grid.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What are the constraints on the input?**
   - Can we assume that the values in the grid and the color are all integers and within a specific range?
   - Can the grid be irregular or will it always be a well-formed 2D array?
   
2. **Should diagonally adjacent cells be considered linked as part of the same component?**
   - According to the problem statement, only the 4-directionally connected cells (above, below, left, and right) are considered.
   
3. **What is the range of values for `row`, `col`, and `color`?**
   - Typically, `row` and `col` should be valid indices within the grid, and `color` is any valid integer.

### Strategy:
1. **Depth First Search (DFS):**
   - We use DFS to explore the connected component starting from the cell `(row, col)`.
   
2. **Identify Border Cells:**
   - As we perform DFS, we check if any cell is on the border or if it is adjacent to a cell of a different color. If either is true, the cell is marked as a border cell.
   
3. **Color Border Cells:**
   - After identifying all border cells, we change their color.

### Code:

```java
public class Solution {
    private int initialColor;
    private int newColor;
    
    public int[][] colorBorder(int[][] grid, int row, int col, int color) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        initialColor = grid[row][col];
        newColor = color;
        boolean[][] visited = new boolean[m][n];
        
        dfs(grid, row, col, visited, m, n);
        
        return grid;
    }
    
    private void dfs(int[][] grid, int row, int col, boolean[][] visited, int m, int n) {
        if(row < 0 || row >= m || col < 0 || col >= n || visited[row][col] || grid[row][col] != initialColor) {
            return;
        }
        
        visited[row][col] = true;
        
        boolean isBorderCell = false;
        if(row == 0 || row == m - 1 || col == 0 || col == n - 1) {
            isBorderCell = true;
        }
        
        int[] rowOffsets = {-1, 1, 0, 0};
        int[] colOffsets = {0, 0, -1, 1};
        
        for(int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            int newRow = row + rowOffsets[i];
            int newCol = col + colOffsets[i];
            if(newRow < 0 || newRow >= m || newCol < 0 || newCol >= n || (grid[newRow][newCol] != initialColor && !visited[newRow][newCol])) {
                isBorderCell = true;
            } else {
                dfs(grid, newRow, newCol, visited, m, n);
            }
        }
        
        if(isBorderCell) {
            grid[row][col] = newColor;
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n)` where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid. In the worst-case scenario, we may have to visit each cell exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(m * n)` due to the recursion stack and the visited matrix.
