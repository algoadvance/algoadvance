[Leetcode 1882. Process Tasks Using Servers full problem statement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1882)
### Problem Statement

You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays `servers` and `tasks` of lengths `n` and `m` respectively. `servers[i]` is the weight of the `i`-th server, and `tasks[j]` is the time needed to process the `j`-th task in seconds.

Tasks are assigned to the servers using the following rules:

1. Each task can only be processed by one server at a time.
2. Each server can only process one task at a time.
3. Assign each task to the server with the smallest weight that is free. If there is a tie, assign the task to the server with the smallest index.
4. If all servers are busy, wait until the next free server becomes available. If there are multiple servers available at the same time, assign the task to the server with the smallest weight or the smallest index if there is a tie.

Return an array of `m` integers, where the `i-th` integer is the index of the server that the `i-th` task will be assigned to.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the weights and times have negative values?
   - No, the weights and times are positive integers.
2. What should be done if there are no servers available at the time a task is to be processed?
   - The task should wait until the next available server.
3. Are `servers` and `tasks` lists always nonempty?
   - Yes, both `servers` and `tasks` lists are always nonempty.

### Strategy

1. Use a min-heap (priority queue) to efficiently retrieve the server with the smallest weight that is free. Use an additional attribute to manage the tie situations.
2. Two heaps can be maintained:
   - `availableServers` to keep track of the servers that are currently free and their attributes (weight and index).
   - `busyServers` to keep track of when each server will become free.
3. Iterate over each task, and at each step:
   - Move servers from the `busyServers` heap to the `availableServers` heap if they have become free.
   - Assign the task to the server that is free and has the smallest weight (break ties using the server index).
   - If no servers are free, process the next available servers.
4. Maintain a result array to store the index of the server assigned to each task.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public static int[] assignTasks(int[] servers, int[] tasks) {
        int n = servers.length;
        int m = tasks.length;
        
        PriorityQueue<int[]> availableServers = new PriorityQueue<>(
            (a, b) -> a[0] == b[0] ? Integer.compare(a[1], b[1]) : Integer.compare(a[0], b[0])
        );
        PriorityQueue<int[]> busyServers = new PriorityQueue<>(
            (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[0], b[0])
        );
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            availableServers.offer(new int[]{servers[i], i});
        }
        
        int[] result = new int[m];
        int currentTime = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < m; i++) {
            currentTime = Math.max(currentTime, i);
            while (!busyServers.isEmpty() && busyServers.peek()[0] <= currentTime) {
                int[] server = busyServers.poll();
                availableServers.offer(new int[]{server[1], server[2]});
            }
            
            if (availableServers.isEmpty()) {
                currentTime = busyServers.peek()[0];
                while (!busyServers.isEmpty() && busyServers.peek()[0] <= currentTime) {
                    int[] server = busyServers.poll();
                    availableServers.offer(new int[]{server[1], server[2]});
                }
            }
            
            int[] assignedServer = availableServers.poll();
            result[i] = assignedServer[1];
            busyServers.offer(new int[]{currentTime + tasks[i], assignedServer[0], assignedServer[1]});
        }
        
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();

        int[] servers = {3, 3, 2}; 
        int[] tasks = {1, 2, 3, 2, 1, 2};
        System.out.println(Arrays.toString(sol.assignTasks(servers, tasks)));  // Expected output: [2, 2, 0, 2, 1, 2]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The overall time complexity is \(O(m \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of servers and \(m\) is the number of tasks.
- This is because each task requires up to \(O(\log n)\) operations due to heap operations for both available and busy servers.
