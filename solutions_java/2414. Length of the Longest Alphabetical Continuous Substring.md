[Leetcode 2414. Length of the Longest Alphabetical Continuous Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2414)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` consisting of only lowercase English letters, return the length of the longest alphabetical continuous substring.

An alphabetical continuous substring is a substring that consists of consecutive letters in the alphabet, such as "abc" or "xyz".

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Should the input string length be considered? (Confirmed to be within typical bounds as per common string problems)
   - Are there any special characters or only lowercase letters? (Only lowercase letters)

2. **Output:**
   - What if the string is empty? (Assume we return 0 for an empty string or non-qualifying input)

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - How to handle very short strings (like length 1)? (The length of 1 should be returned as the substrings are trivially continuous)

### Strategy

The strategy is to iterate through the string while maintaining a count of the current length of the continuous alphabetical substring. Whenever the substring breaks (next character is not the consecutive letter to the current one), we'll check if the current count is the maximum so far and reset the count. Finally, we return the maximum length found.

1. **Initialize Variables:**
   - `maxLength` to keep track of the maximum length found.
   - `currentLength` to keep track of the current substring length we're checking.

2. **Iterate through the String:**
   - Start from the second character and compare it with the previous one.
   - If they are consecutive (current character is the next character in the alphabet compared to the previous one), increment `currentLength`.
   - Otherwise, update `maxLength` if `currentLength` is greater and reset `currentLength` to 1.

3. **Final Check:**
   - After the loop, a final check to update `maxLength` in case the longest substring is at the end.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int longestContinuousSubstring(String s) {
        if (s == null || s.length() == 0) return 0;

        int maxLength = 1;
        int currentLength = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i < s.length(); i++) {
            if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(i - 1) + 1) {
                currentLength++;
            } else {
                if (currentLength > maxLength) {
                    maxLength = currentLength;
                }
                currentLength = 1;
            }
        }

        return Math.max(maxLength, currentLength);
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.longestContinuousSubstring("abcdef")); // Expected: 6
        System.out.println(sol.longestContinuousSubstring("abacaba")); // Expected: 2
        System.out.println(sol.longestContinuousSubstring("xyz")); // Expected: 3
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. We are iterating through the string once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, since we are using a fixed amount of extra space for the variables `maxLength` and `currentLength`.
