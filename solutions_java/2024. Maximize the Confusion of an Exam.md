[Leetcode 2024. Maximize the Confusion of an Exam](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2024)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `answerKey`, where each character is either 'T' (true) or 'F' (false). You are also given an integer `k`, which represents the maximum number of changes you can make.

You need to maximize the length of a contiguous subarray within `answerKey` that contains the same letter (either all 'T' or all 'F') after making at most `k` changes. 

Return the maximum length of such a subarray.

### Example:

#### Example 1:
```
Input: answerKey = "TTFF", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: We can change any two 'F' to 'T' to form "TTTT".
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: answerKey = "TFFT", k = 1
Output: 3
Explanation: We can change the 'F' to 'T' to form "TTT" or the 'T' to 'F' to form "FFF".
```

#### Example 3:
```
Input: answerKey = "TTFTTFTT", k = 1
Output: 5
Explanation: We can change the first 'F' to 'T' to form "TTTTTFTT".
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Should we consider only periods of 'T' or 'F' without internal breaks?
   - Yes, you need to consider the maximum length of contiguous subarray containing same letter (either all 'T' or all 'F') after at most `k` changes.

2. Can the input `answerKey` length exceed practical limits?
   - Typical interview problem constraints should apply (e.g., `1 <= answerKey.length <= 10^5`).

3. Are there any other constraints or special conditions we should consider?
   - You can leverage a sliding window approach to ensure that the solution is efficient.

## Strategy

We will use the sliding window technique to find the longest subarray for both 'T' and 'F'. This involves:

1. Keeping two sliding window pointers (start and end).
2. Counting the number of changes needed to convert a segment into all 'T' or all 'F'.
3. Adjusting the window size whenever the number of changes exceeds `k`.

## Code

Here's the Java code to solve the problem:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int maxConsecutiveAnswers(String answerKey, int k) {
        return Math.max(maxLength(answerKey, k, 'T'), maxLength(answerKey, k, 'F'));
    }

    private int maxLength(String answerKey, int k, char ch) {
        int maxLength = 0;
        int start = 0;
        int count = 0;
        
        for (int end = 0; end < answerKey.length(); end++) {
            if (answerKey.charAt(end) != ch) {
                count++;
            }
            
            while (count > k) {
                if (answerKey.charAt(start) != ch) {
                    count--;
                }
                start++;
            }
            
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, end - start + 1);
        }
        
        return maxLength;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
  - Each character in the input string is processed at most twice (once by the start pointer and once by the end pointer), making this approach linear in the length of the string.
  
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\)
  - Only a fixed amount of extra space is used, regardless of the input size.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum length of a subarray that can be turned into all 'T's or all 'F's with at most `k` changes.
