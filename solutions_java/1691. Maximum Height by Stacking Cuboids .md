[Leetcode 1691. Maximum Height by Stacking Cuboids ](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1691)
### Problem Statement
Given `n` cuboids where the dimensions of the i-th cuboid is given as `cuboids[i] = [width_i, length_i, height_i]`. Choose a subset of the cuboids and place them on each other. You can rotate any cuboid to use any of its dimensions as the width, length, or height. Return the maximum height of the stacked cuboids.

A cuboid `[width_a, length_a, height_a]` can be placed on cuboid `[width_b, length_b, height_b]` if and only if `width_a <= width_b`, `length_a <= length_b`, and `height_a <= height_b`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the cuboids be rotated?**
   - Yes, any dimension could be used as width, length, or height.
   
2. **Is there a specific order to be maintained while stacking?**
   - The only constraints are the dimension conditions when stacking, so no specific order apart from those conditions.

3. **What constraints are applied on the input size?**
   - Typically in LeetCode problems, the number of cuboids `n` could be up to `10^3`.

### Strategy
1. **Normalize Dimensions:** First, normalize each cuboid dimension such that `width <= length <= height`. This simplifies comparisons.
2. **Sort the Cuboids:** Sort cuboids based on dimensions to ensure any valid stack obeys the order by definition.
3. **Dynamic Programming:** Use DP to compute the maximum stack height.
   - Define `dp[i]` as the maximum height of the stack with the `i-th` cuboid as the top.
   - Iterate over each cuboid and determine if it can be placed on top of any previously considered cuboid in the sorted list.

### Code
Let's implement the above strategy in Java.

```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class MaximumHeightByStackingCuboids {
    
    public int maxHeight(int[][] cuboids) {
        // Normalize each cuboid's dimensions to [width, length, height] where width <= length <= height
        for (int[] cuboid : cuboids) {
            Arrays.sort(cuboid);
        }
        
        // Sort cuboids by dimensions
        Arrays.sort(cuboids, (a, b) -> {
            if (a[0] != b[0]) return a[0] - b[0];
            if (a[1] != b[1]) return a[1] - b[1];
            return a[2] - b[2];
        });
        
        int n = cuboids.length;
        int[] dp = new int[n];
        int maxHeight = 0;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i] = cuboids[i][2];  // Initial height if the cuboid `i` is at the top by itself.
            for (int j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                if (cuboids[i][0] >= cuboids[j][0] && 
                    cuboids[i][1] >= cuboids[j][1] && 
                    cuboids[i][2] >= cuboids[j][2]) {
                    dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + cuboids[i][2]);
                }
            }
            maxHeight = Math.max(maxHeight, dp[i]);
        }
        
        return maxHeight;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MaximumHeightByStackingCuboids solution = new MaximumHeightByStackingCuboids();
        int[][] cuboids = \ use example from above
        System.out.println(solution.maxHeight(cuboids));  // Output: 190
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Normalizing Dimensions:** \(O(n \cdot 3 \log 3) = O(n)\)
- **Sorting Cuboids:** \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Dynamic Programming:** \(O(n^2)\)

The overall time complexity is **O(n^2)** due to the nested loop in the dynamic programming solution. This is efficient enough for `n` up to \(10^3\).
