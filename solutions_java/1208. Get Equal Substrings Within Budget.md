[Leetcode 1208. Get Equal Substrings Within Budget](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1208)
### Problem Statement
You are given two strings `s` and `t` of the same length and an integer `maxCost`. You want to change `s` to `t`. Changing the `i-th` character of `s` to `i-th` character of `t` costs `|s[i] - t[i]|` (i.e., the absolute difference between the ASCII values of the characters). The cost of a substring is the sum of the cost of each character in the substring. Return the maximum length of a substring of `s` that can be changed to a corresponding substring of `t` with a cost less than or equal to `maxCost`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:** Can `s` and `t` contain only lowercase English letters?
2. **Edge Cases:** What should be returned if the maximum cost is 0?
3. **Output:** Should the result be the length of the maximum substring?

### Strategy
To find the maximum length of a substring that meets the conditions, we can use the sliding window (or two-pointer) technique:
1. Initialize two pointers (`start` and `end`) at the beginning of the strings and a variable to keep track of the current cost.
2. Expand the window by moving `end` and calculate the cost incrementally.
3. If the cost exceeds `maxCost`, increment the `start` pointer to reduce the window size until the cost is within the limit.
4. Keep track of the maximum length of the window that meets the cost constraint.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int equalSubstring(String s, String t, int maxCost) {
        int start = 0;
        int currentCost = 0;
        int maxLength = 0;

        for (int end = 0; end < s.length(); end++) {
            currentCost += Math.abs(s.charAt(end) - t.charAt(end));

            while (currentCost > maxCost) {
                currentCost -= Math.abs(s.charAt(start) - t.charAt(start));
                start++;
            }
            
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, end - start + 1);
        }

        return maxLength;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.equalSubstring("abcd", "bcdf", 3));  // Output: 3
        System.out.println(sol.equalSubstring("abcd", "cdef", 3));  // Output: 1
        System.out.println(sol.equalSubstring("abcd", "acde", 0));  // Output: 1
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the strings. This is because each character is visited at most twice (once by the `end` pointer and once by the `start` pointer, in case the window needs to be shrunk).

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is **O(1)** since we are using only a few extra variables for pointers and tracking current cost; no additional space proportional to the input size is required.
