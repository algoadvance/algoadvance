[Leetcode 2844. Minimum Operations to Make a Special Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2844)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `num` representing a large integer. Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations needed to make the number a "special" number. A "special" number is defined as a number that is divisible by 25 and can have leading zeroes. The only operation you are allowed to do is to delete any digit from `num`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum length of the string `num`?**
   - The maximum length is typically a constraint that needs to be specified in the problem. Assuming standard constraints, it is usually around 10^5 for LeetCode problems.

2. **Is the string `num` guaranteed to contain only digits?**
   - Yes, the problem guarantees that `num` is composed of only digits.

3. **Can the resulting number have leading zeroes?**
   - Yes, the resulting number can have leading zeroes.

4. **Do I need to handle any special cases like an empty string or strings that are shorter than the length of two?**
   - The problem implies that `num` has at least one digit, and we can assume typical edge case handling for strings shorter than two digits.

### Strategy

To make the number divisible by 25, the last two digits of the number must be one of the following pairs: `00`, `25`, `50`, or `75`. The strategy involves:

1. Loop through the string from the end to the start and try to locate each possible pair in the least number of deletions.
2. For each of these pairs (`00`, `25`, `50`, `75`):
   - Start from the end of the string and find the second-last character of the pair.
   - Then continue to find the last character of the pair before or at the position of the second-last character.
3. Track the minimum deletions required to form any of these pairs.

### Code

```java
public class MinimumOperationsToMakeSpecialNumber {
    public int minimumOperations(String num) {
        return Math.min(
            findMinDeletions(num, '0', '0'),
            Math.min(
                findMinDeletions(num, '2', '5'),
                Math.min(
                    findMinDeletions(num, '5', '0'),
                    findMinDeletions(num, '7', '5')
                )
            )
        );
    }

    private int findMinDeletions(String num, char lastChar, char secondLastChar) {
        int n = num.length();
        int lastCharIndex = -1;
        int deletions = 0;
        
        // Find lastChar from the end
        for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (num.charAt(i) == lastChar) {
                lastCharIndex = i;
                break;
            }
            deletions++;
        }

        if (lastCharIndex == -1) return Integer.MAX_VALUE; // If we never found the lastChar
        
        for (int i = lastCharIndex - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (num.charAt(i) == secondLastChar) {
                return deletions;
            }
            deletions++;
        }
        
        return Integer.MAX_VALUE;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumOperationsToMakeSpecialNumber solution = new MinimumOperationsToMakeSpecialNumber();
        System.out.println(solution.minimumOperations("2245047")); // Output: 2 (e.g., remove '2' and '4')
        System.out.println(solution.minimumOperations("2908305")); // Output: 3 (e.g., remove '9', '0', '3')
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Finding minimum deletions for a pair**: The function `findMinDeletions` runs in O(n) time, where `n` is the length of the string.
- **Overall**: Since the function is called four times (once for each pair), the overall time complexity remains O(n).

This ensures the solution is efficient even for large input sizes.
