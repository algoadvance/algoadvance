[Leetcode 1737. Change Minimum Characters to Satisfy One of Three Conditions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1737)
### Problem Statement

Given two strings `a` and `b`, your goal is to satisfy one of the following conditions by performing the minimum number of operations (each operation consists of changing a single character in one of the strings):

1. Every character in `a` is strictly less than every character in `b` in lexicographical order.
2. Every character in `b` is strictly less than every character in `a` in lexicographical order.
3. Both strings `a` and `b` are made up of only one distinct character.

Return the minimum number of operations required to achieve one of these conditions.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of lengths for strings `a` and `b`?**
   - The length of each string will be between 1 and 100,000 inclusive.
   
2. **What kind of characters do `a` and `b` contain?**
   - Both strings `a` and `b` contain only lowercase English letters.

3. **Are there any constraints on the characters in the strings beyond being lowercase letters?**
   - No, there are no other constraints.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to consider the three conditions and determine the minimum operations for each:

1. **Condition 1 and 2:** Ensure that every character of one string is less than every character in the other string by considering prefix sums to calculate how many characters need to be changed.
2. **Condition 3:** Make both strings contain the same character (which involves counting the frequencies of each character).

**Detailed Approach:**

1. **Frequency Calculation:**
   - Calculate the frequency of each character in both strings `a` and `b`.

2. **Prefix Sums:**
   - Create prefix sum arrays for both strings to efficiently count characters less than a given character.

3. **Evaluate Conditions:**
   - For conditions (1) and (2), iterate through each possible character to ensure all characters of `a` are less than `b` or vice versa.
   - For condition (3), calculate the minimum changes required to make both strings comprised of the same character.

### Code

```java
public class MinimumChanges {
    public int minCharacters(String a, String b) {
        int[] countA = new int[26];
        int[] countB = new int[26];
        
        // Count frequencies of each character in both strings.
        for (char c : a.toCharArray()) {
            countA[c - 'a']++;
        }
        for (char c : b.toCharArray()) {
            countB[c - 'a']++;
        }
        
        int minOperations = Integer.MAX_VALUE;

        // Pre-calculate prefix sums
        int[] prefixSumA = new int[26];
        int[] prefixSumB = new int[26];

        prefixSumA[0] = countA[0];
        prefixSumB[0] = countB[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < 26; i++) {
            prefixSumA[i] = prefixSumA[i - 1] + countA[i];
            prefixSumB[i] = prefixSumB[i - 1] + countB[i];
        }

        // Condition 1 and 2
        for (int i = 0; i < 25; i++) {
            int changesAtoB = (a.length() - prefixSumA[i]) + prefixSumB[i];
            int changesBtoA = (b.length() - prefixSumB[i]) + prefixSumA[i];
            
            minOperations = Math.min(minOperations, Math.min(changesAtoB, changesBtoA));
        }

        // Condition 3
        for (int i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            int changes = (a.length() - countA[i]) + (b.length() - countB[i]);
            minOperations = Math.min(minOperations, changes);
        }

        return minOperations;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumChanges solution = new MinimumChanges();
        System.out.println(solution.minCharacters("aba", "caa")); // Expected output: 2
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Frequency Calculation:** `O(n + m)` where `n` is the length of `a` and `m` is the length of `b`.
- **Prefix Sums Calculation:** `O(26)` which is constant.
- **Evaluate Conditions:** Three conditions together take `O(26)` for each candidate character.
- Overall, the time complexity is `O(n + m)`, which is efficient given the constraints.
