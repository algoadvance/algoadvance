[Leetcode 55. Jump Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l55)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return `true` if you can reach the last index, or `false` otherwise.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which makes it impossible to reach the last index.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input array be empty?**
   - No, according to the problem, the array will contain at least one element.

2. **What are the constraints on the length of the input array?**
   - `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
  
3. **What are the constraints on the values within the array?**
   - `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^5`

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can utilize a greedy approach. We need to keep track of the farthest point that can be reached while iterating through the array. Hereâ€™s the plan:

1. Initialize a variable `maxReach` to keep track of the maximum index we can reach so far.
2. Iterate through the array; for each index `i`:
   - If `i` is greater than `maxReach`, it means we can't reach index `i`, hence return `false`.
   - Update `maxReach` to be the maximum of `maxReach` and `i + nums[i]`.
   - If at any point `maxReach` is greater than or equal to the last index of the array, return `true`.
3. Return `true` if the loop completes successfully.

### Code

```java
public class JumpGame {
    public boolean canJump(int[] nums) {
        int maxReach = 0;
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (i > maxReach) {
                return false;
            }
            maxReach = Math.max(maxReach, i + nums[i]);
            if (maxReach >= nums.length - 1) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JumpGame jumpGame = new JumpGame();
        int[] nums1 = {2, 3, 1, 1, 4};
        int[] nums2 = {3, 2, 1, 0, 4};
        System.out.println(jumpGame.canJump(nums1)); // Output: true
        System.out.println(jumpGame.canJump(nums2)); // Output: false
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the input array. We are iterating through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), no additional space other than a few integer variables.

This solution effectively determines whether you can reach the end of the array using a greedy approach, making it efficient and straightforward.
