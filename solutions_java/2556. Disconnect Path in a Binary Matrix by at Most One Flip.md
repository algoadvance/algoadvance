[Leetcode 2556. Disconnect Path in a Binary Matrix by at Most One Flip](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2556)
### Problem Statement

You are given a binary matrix `grid` of size `n x m`, where each cell can be either 0 (blocked) or 1 (open). We start from the cell `(0,0)` and want to reach the cell `(n-1, m-1)` by moving only through cells with value 1 (open cells). We can move in four possible directions: up, down, left, and right.

You need to check if it is possible to disconnect the path from `(0,0)` to `(n-1, m-1)` by flipping at most one cell from 1 to 0. If so, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can edges of the grid wrap around (circular grid)?**
   - No, moves can only be in the four cardinal directions within the grid boundaries.
   
2. **Is the start or end always guaranteed to be 1?**
   - Yes, `(0,0)` and `(n-1,m-1)` are always guaranteed to be 1s.

3. **What if the grid is already disconnected?**
   - If the path is already disconnected, you should return `true`.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Path Check**: First, check if a valid path exists from `(0,0)` to `(n-1,m-1)`. This can be done using Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS).

2. **Potential Flip Impact**: If the initial path exists, analyze the impact of flipping each 1 in the path except for start `(0,0)` and end `(n-1,m-1)`. For each such cell, flip it to 0 and check if the path still exists. If at least one flip disconnects the path, return `true`.

3. **Early Termination**: If, during any point of checking flips, we find that any flip disconnects the path, we immediately return `true`.

4. **No Disconnection**: If no single flip can disconnect the path after checking all possibilities, return `false`.

### Code

Here's the Java implementation for the solution:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public boolean isDisconnectedAfterOneFlip(int[][] grid) {
        int n = grid.length;
        int m = grid[0].length;
        
        if (!hasPath(grid, n, m, 0, 0, new boolean[n][m])) {
            return true; // Initial grid is already disconnected
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < m; j++) {
                if (grid[i][j] == 1 && !(i == 0 && j == 0) && !(i == n - 1 && j == m - 1)) {
                    grid[i][j] = 0; // Flip
                    if (!hasPath(grid, n, m, 0, 0, new boolean[n][m])) {
                        return true;
                    }
                    grid[i][j] = 1; // Flip back
                }
            }
        }
        
        return false;
    }
    
    private boolean hasPath(int[][] grid, int n, int m, int x, int y, boolean[][] visited) {
        if (x == n - 1 && y == m - 1) return true;
        
        visited[x][y] = true;
        int[] dx = {0, 1, 0, -1};
        int[] dy = {1, 0, -1, 0};
        
        for (int i = 0; i < 4; i++) {
            int nx = x + dx[i];
            int ny = y + dy[i];
            if (nx >= 0 && ny >= 0 && nx < n && ny < m && !visited[nx][ny] && grid[nx][ny] == 1) {
                if (hasPath(grid, n, m, nx, ny, visited)) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
        
        visited[x][y] = false;
        return false;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Initial Path Check**: The initial path checking using DFS or BFS will take `O(n * m)` time.

2. **Flip Impact Analysis**: For each cell in the grid (again `O(n * m)` potential cells), we perform another DFS or BFS which has a time complexity of `O(n * m)`. Thus, the total time complexity for checking all possible flips is `O((n * m) * (n * m)) = O(n^2 * m^2)`.

Because we are performing nested traversals for checking paths and checking the impact of each flip, the overall complexity results in `O(n^2 * m^2)`. This is typically feasible for smaller grids, but could be slow for larger grids. Optimizations may be required for further improvements in real-world applications.
