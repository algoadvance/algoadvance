[Leetcode 1611. Minimum One Bit Operations to Make Integers Zero](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1611)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, you need to perform operations to transform the integer into `0`. In one operation, you can choose any integer `x` with exactly one bit set in its binary representation (which means it's equal to `2^k` for some non-negative integer `k`) and flip the bits of `n` from 0 to `x`. Your goal is to return the minimum number of operations needed to transform the integer `n` to `0`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of the integer `n`?**
   - Typically, `n` can be any non-negative integer, but it's useful to know if there are any constraints like `0 <= n <= 10^9`.

2. **Is there any specific format required for the result?**
   - The result should be an integer representing the minimum number of operations.

### Example
To transform the integer `3` (`11` in binary) to `0`:
1. Flip the bit at `2^1` (binary becomes `01`).
2. Flip the bit at `2^0` (binary becomes `00`).

We need 2 operations.

### Strategy
The key insight here is to use a recursive approach along with an understanding of binary operations. Here's the strategy to solve the problem:

1. **Binary Manipulation**: The operations described involve flipping leading bits and hence binary representation plays a crucial role.
2. **Recursive Approach**: We can recursively determine the minimum operations needed:
   - Base case: If `n` is `0`, then no operations are needed.
   - Otherwise, find the position of the most significant bit (MSB) with value `1`.
   - Reduce the problem to transforming `(n xor (1 << msb))` to `0` and then flipping the `msb` bit.

### Code

Here's a Java implementation to solve the problem:

```java
public class Solution {
    public int minimumOneBitOperations(int n) {
        return helper(n);
    }
    
    private int helper(int x) {
        if (x == 0) return 0;
        int msb = 31 - Integer.numberOfLeadingZeros(x);
        return (1 << msb) - 1 - helper(x ^ (1 << msb));
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.minimumOneBitOperations(3)); // Output: 2
        System.out.println(solution.minimumOneBitOperations(6)); // Output: 4
        // Add more test cases as needed.
    }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Base Case**: If `x` is `0`, then we need `0` operations.
2. **Find the Most Significant Bit (MSB)**: Use `Integer.numberOfLeadingZeros(x)` to find the position of MSB.
3. **Recursive Calculation**:
   - Flip all bits up to the MSB by `1 << msb`.
   - Continue the same process by recursively calling `helper` with `x xor (1 << msb)`.
   - Accumulate the result using `(1 << msb) - 1 - helper(new_x)`.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is `O(log n)` because with each recursion, the bit-length of `n` is effectively halved. The bit-length of `n` is proportional to `log n`, leading to the logarithmic complexity.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is `O(log n)` due to the recursive call stack depth, proportional to the bit-length of `n`.
