[Leetcode 704. Binary Search](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l704)
### Problem Statement
Given a sorted array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`, write a function to search for `target` in `nums`. If `target` exists, then return its index. Otherwise, return -1.

You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 9
Output: 4
Explanation: 9 exists in nums and its index is 4
```

Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [-1,0,3,5,9,12], target = 2
Output: -1
Explanation: 2 does not exist in nums so return -1
```

Constraints:
- You must write an algorithm with `O(log n)` runtime complexity.
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
- `-10^4 <= nums[i], target <= 10^4`
- All elements in `nums` are unique.
- `nums` is sorted in ascending order.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Is the input array always sorted in ascending order?
   - Yes, the prompt specifies that the array is sorted in ascending order.
2. Are there any duplicate elements in the array?
   - No, all elements in `nums` are unique.
3. What should the function return if the target is not found?
   - The function should return -1 if the target is not found.

### Strategy
The problem requires an `O(log n)` runtime complexity, which is a strong indication to use the Binary Search algorithm. Hereâ€™s how the binary search will work in this context:

1. Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, to represent the search interval's boundaries.
   - `left` initially pointing to the first index (0).
   - `right` initially pointing to the last index (`nums.length - 1`).
2. While the search interval is valid (i.e., `left` is less than or equal to `right`):
   - Compute the midpoint index `mid` as `(left + right) / 2`.
   - Compare the element at `mid` with the `target`:
     - If `nums[mid]` equals `target`, return `mid`.
     - If `nums[mid]` is less than `target`, move the `left` pointer to `mid + 1` (search in the right subarray).
     - If `nums[mid]` is greater than `target`, move the `right` pointer to `mid - 1` (search in the left subarray).
3. If the loop ends without finding the `target`, return -1.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int search(int[] nums, int target) {
        int left = 0;
        int right = nums.length - 1;
        
        while (left <= right) {
            int mid = left + (right - left) / 2; // prevents overflow more safely than (left + right) / 2
            if (nums[mid] == target) {
                return mid;
            } else if (nums[mid] < target) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return -1; // Target not found
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the binary search algorithm is `O(log n)` due to the following:
- Each iteration of the while loop reduces the search interval by half.
- The approach ensures quick narrowing down of the possible search range.

The space complexity is `O(1)` as we are only using a constant amount of extra space for variables `left`, `right`, and `mid`.

This completes the explanation and solution for the binary search algorithm in Java to solve the given problem on LeetCode.
