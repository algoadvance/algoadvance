[Leetcode 629. K Inverse Pairs Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l629)
### Problem Statement

Given two integers `n` and `k`, find how many different arrays consist of numbers from `1` to `n` such that there are exactly `k` inverse pairs. The answer can be huge, so return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Inverse pairs** are those `(i, j)` such that `i < j` and `A[i] > A[j]`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: n = 3, k = 0
Output: 1
Explanation: 
Only the array [1,2,3] which consists of numbers from 1 to 3 has exactly 0 inverse pairs.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: n = 3, k = 1
Output: 2
Explanation: 
The array [1,3,2] and [2,1,3] have exactly 1 inverse pair.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of values for `n` and `k`?
   - `1 <= n <= 1000`
   - `0 <= k <= 1000`
   
2. Should we return the result modulo `10^9 + 7`?
   - Yes, as the problem states the result should be returned modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Strategy

This problem can be tackled using dynamic programming. We need to create a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of arrays that can be formed with `i` elements and `j` inverse pairs.

#### Steps:
1. Initialize a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the count of arrays with `i` elements and exactly `j` inverse pairs.
2. Base Case: `dp[0][0]` is 1, as there's exactly one way to have zero elements with zero inverse pairs (the empty array).
3. Iterate over the range of elements and possible inverse pairs to fill in the DP table.
4. For each `i` from 1 to `n`, and for each `j` from 0 to `k`, use the relation:
   - `dp[i][j]` is calculated by summing up the last `i` entries in the previous row `dp[i-1][...]`.
   - This can be optimized using a sliding window approach for the summation.

The general relation can be given by:
\[ dp[i][j] = \sum_{x=0}^{\min(j, i-1)} dp[i-1][j-x] \]

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \( O(n \times k) \) because we iterate over the dimensions of the table and fill in values based on previous computations. This is feasible within the given constraints.

### Code

```java
public class KInversePairsArray {
    public int kInversePairs(int n, int k) {
        final int MOD = 1000000007;
        int[][] dp = new int[n+1][k+1];

        dp[0][0] = 1;

        for (int i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j <= k; j++) {
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i-1][j]) % MOD;
                if (j - i >= 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] - dp[i-1][j-i] + MOD) % MOD;
                }
                if (j > 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + dp[i][j-1]) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }

        return dp[n][k];
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        KInversePairsArray solver = new KInversePairsArray();
        System.out.println(solver.kInversePairs(3, 0)); // Output: 1
        System.out.println(solver.kInversePairs(3, 1)); // Output: 2
    }
}
```

This code provides a dynamic programming solution to count the number of arrays that can be formed with exactly `k` inverse pairs using the given `n` elements. The result is returned modulo `10^9 + 7` to handle large numbers.
