[Leetcode 435. Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l435)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of intervals `intervals` where `intervals[i] = [start_i, end_i]` represent the start and end of the ith interval. Return the minimum number of intervals you need to remove to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.

Example 1:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,4],[1,3]]
Output: 1
Explanation: [1,3] can be removed and the rest of the intervals are non-overlapping.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[1,2],[1,2]]
Output: 2
Explanation: You need to remove two [1,2] to make the rest of the intervals non-overlapping.
```

Example 3:
```
Input: intervals = [[1,2],[2,3]]
Output: 0
Explanation: You don't need to remove any of the intervals since they're already non-overlapping.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the intervals be unsorted initially?**
   - Yes, the intervals can be provided in any order.

2. **Are the interval boundaries inclusive or exclusive?**
   - The intervals are inclusive of the start and end values.

3. **What is the range of the intervals?**
   - There are no explicit constraints in the example, but typically the interval range will be within reasonable bounds for solving within typical computational limits.

4. **Can intervals have zero length (i.e., start_i == end_i)?**
   - Yes, intervals can have zero length.

### Code
```java
import java.util.Arrays;

public class Solution {
    public int eraseOverlapIntervals(int[][] intervals) {
        if (intervals.length == 0) {
            return 0;
        }

        // Sort the intervals based on their end time
        Arrays.sort(intervals, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[1], b[1]));

        int end = intervals[0][1];
        int count = 0;

        for (int i = 1; i < intervals.length; i++) {
            if (intervals[i][0] < end) {
                // We need to remove this interval
                count++;
            } else {
                // Update the end to be the end of this interval
                end = intervals[i][1];
            }
        }

        return count;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();

        int[][] intervals1 = // use example above
        System.out.println(sol.eraseOverlapIntervals(intervals1)); // Output: 1

        int[][] intervals2 = // use example above
        System.out.println(sol.eraseOverlapIntervals(intervals2)); // Output: 2

        int[][] intervals3 = // use example above
        System.out.println(sol.eraseOverlapIntervals(intervals3)); // Output: 0
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Intervals by End Time:**
   - Sorting the intervals by their end time allows us to always choose the interval that ends the earliest, maximizing the number of non-overlapping intervals.

2. **Greedy Approach:**
   - Start with the first interval and check if the next interval starts before the current interval ends.
   - If it does, count this as an overlap and potentially removable.
   - Otherwise, update the end time to the current interval's end time and continue.

3. **Count Overlaps:**
   - For each overlapping interval found, increment the count.
   - The count will give the minimum number of intervals that need to be removed.

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** O(n log n), where n is the number of intervals.
- **Iteration:** O(n), since we are iterating through the intervals once to check for overlaps.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)** due to the sorting step.
