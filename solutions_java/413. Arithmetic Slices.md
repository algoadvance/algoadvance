[Leetcode 413. Arithmetic Slices](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l413)
### Problem Statement
An integer array is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same. For example, `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`, `[7, 7, 7, 7]`, and `[3, -1, -5, -9]` are arithmetic sequences.

Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of arithmetic subarrays of `nums`.

### Example
- Example 1:
    - Input: `nums = [1, 2, 3, 4]`
    - Output: `3`
    - Explanation: The arithmetic subarrays are `[1, 2, 3]`, `[2, 3, 4]`, and `[1, 2, 3, 4]` itself.
- Example 2:
    - Input: `nums = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`
    - Output: `6`
    - Explanation: The arithmetic subarrays with size â‰¥ 3 are `[1, 3, 5]`, `[3, 5, 7]`, `[5, 7, 9]`, `[1, 3, 5, 7]`, `[3, 5, 7, 9]`, and `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of values for the elements in `nums`?**
   - The elements in `nums` are integers. The exact range is not specified, but this algorithm should handle typical integer ranges.
2. **What is the length range of the input array `nums`?**
   - The array length should be at least 1 and up to a large number typical of problem constraints, possibly around 10,000.

### Strategy
1. **Understand that an arithmetic subarray has a constant difference `d` between consecutive elements.**
2. **Iterate through the array while keeping track of the current length of the arithmetic subarray:**
   - Maintain a count of consecutive elements that form an arithmetic sequence.
   - Use two pointers or a sliding window to identify subarrays with common differences.
3. **For each valid arithmetic subarray found, count the possible arithmetic subarrays it can contribute, extending them as you go.**

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int numberOfArithmeticSlices(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        if (n < 3) return 0;  // There need to be at least three to form an arithmetic subarray

        int totalCount = 0;
        int currentCount = 0;

        // Loop through the array while comparing differences
        for (int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            // Check if the current element, along with the previous two, form an arithmetic sequence
            if (nums[i] - nums[i - 1] == nums[i - 1] - nums[i - 2]) {
                currentCount += 1;
                totalCount += currentCount;  // Accumulate the arithmetic subarrays ending at `i`
            } else {
                currentCount = 0;  // Reset the current arithmetic subarray count
            }
        }

        return totalCount;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        int[] nums1 = {1, 2, 3, 4};  // Expected output: 3
        System.out.println(sol.numberOfArithmeticSlices(nums1));

        int[] nums2 = {1, 3, 5, 7, 9};  // Expected output: 6
        System.out.println(sol.numberOfArithmeticSlices(nums2));
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \( O(n) \)
  - We traverse the array once, making the algorithm linear in time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: \( O(1) \)
  - We use constant space to maintain our counters.

This solution efficiently finds all possible arithmetic subarrays by keeping track of the ongoing sequences and counting them as we go.
