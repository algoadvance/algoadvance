[Leetcode 2976. Minimum Cost to Convert String I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2976)
## Problem Statement

You are given two strings `start` and `target` both of length `n`. Each string consists only of lowercase English letters.

In one operation, you can choose any index `i` (1 <= i <= n) and set the value of `start[i]` to `start[i^k]`, where `^` denotes the bitwise XOR operation and `k` is provided as an input to the problem.

Your task is to convert `start` to `target` in the minimum number of operations.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to convert `start` to `target`, or -1 if it is impossible.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size of the input strings?**
   - The problem states that both strings `start` and `target` are the same length `n`. However, the boundary conditions of `n` are not specified, though we can assume it could be as large as typical constraints in competitive programming (e.g., up to `10^5`).

2. **Are there any constraints on the value of `k`?**
   - Typically, `k` would be within the bounds of the length of the strings. More details are not provided here but must be within the problem's logical bounds.

3. **What kind of operations are allowed?**
   - You can change `start[i]` to `start[i^k]`, which means the modification index `i` gets assigned the bitwise XOR result of the current `start` position with `k`.

## Strategy

1. **Direct Comparison and Feasibility Check:**
   - First, we should verify whether it is even possible to convert `start` to `target` using the available operation.
 
2. **Character Mappings Validation:**
   - If `k = 0`, you can directly transform `start` to `target` iff they are already the same.
   - If `k â‰  0`, we must ensure each character can be mapped between the positions allowed by the XOR operation without creating conflicts.

3. **Graph Representation and BFS:**
   - Treat the indices of the strings as nodes in a graph, where an edge exists between `i` and `i^k`. Then, use BFS to determine if we can make `start[i]` equal `target[i]`.

## Time Complexity

The primary steps involve traversing the string indices and potentially multiple BFS operations, implying our solution will be **O(n)** space and time complexity in the worst case.

## Code

Here's a Java implementation of the described solution:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class MinimumCostConvertString {

    public int minOperations(String start, String target, int k) {
        int n = start.length();
        if (start.equals(target)) return 0;

        if (k == 0) return -1;

        boolean[] visited = new boolean[n];
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (!visited[i]) {
                Queue<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
                List<Integer> indices = new ArrayList<>();
                boolean valid = true;

                queue.add(i);

                while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
                    int idx = queue.poll();
                    if (visited[idx]) continue;
                    visited[idx] = true;
                    indices.add(idx);

                    int xorIdx = idx ^ k;
                    if (xorIdx < n && !visited[xorIdx]) {
                        queue.add(xorIdx);
                    } else if (xorIdx < n) {
                        valid = start.charAt(idx) == start.charAt(xorIdx);
                    }
                }

                if (!valid) return -1;

                Map<Character, Integer> startFreqMap = new HashMap<>();
                Map<Character, Integer> targetFreqMap = new HashMap<>();
                
                for (int index : indices) {
                    startFreqMap.put(start.charAt(index), startFreqMap.getOrDefault(start.charAt(index), 0) + 1);
                    targetFreqMap.put(target.charAt(index), targetFreqMap.getOrDefault(target.charAt(index), 0) + 1);
                }

                for (char c : startFreqMap.keySet()) {
                    if (!startFreqMap.get(c).equals(targetFreqMap.getOrDefault(c, 0))) {
                        return -1;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return n; // If we can group the indices successfully
    
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        MinimumCostConvertString converter = new MinimumCostConvertString();
        
        String start = "abcde";
        String target = "edcba";
        int k = 2;
        
        int result = converter.minOperations(start, target, k);
        System.out.println(result); // Should print the minimum number of operations or -1 if not possible
    }
}
```

### Summary

This code handles the conversion using the provided operations and checks for feasibility by ensuring character frequencies match between correspondingly relatable groups of indices. If there are discrepancies, it returns `-1`, indicating conversion is impossible. The main logic revolves around BFS traversal of strings with O(n) complexity in the worst case.
