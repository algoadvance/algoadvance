[Leetcode 2466. Count Ways To Build Good Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2466)
### Problem Statement

Given two integers `low` and `high`, find the number of ways to build good strings where the length of each string is within the range [low, high] inclusive.

A "good string" is defined as a string containing only the characters 'a' and 'b'.

The answer can be large, so return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the string allowed to contain both 'a' and 'b'?**
   - Yes, the string can contain any combination of 'a' and 'b'.
2. **Are there any other constraints on the characters of the string?**
   - No, the only characters allowed are 'a' and 'b'.
3. **Can the length of the string be exactly `low` or `high`?**
   - Yes, the length can be any value within the inclusive range [low, high].
4. **Are there any restrictions on the values of `low` and `high`?**
   - It is assumed that 1 ≤ `low` ≤ `high` ≤ 10^6.

### Strategy

To solve this, we need to count the total number of valid strings of lengths from `low` to `high` (both inclusive), and since each position in the string can be 'a' or 'b', the number of strings of length `n` is `2^n`.

A dynamic programming approach will be used to efficiently compute this:
- Create an array `dp`, where `dp[i]` represents the number of ways to create a string of length `i`.
- Initialize `dp[0] = 1` (one way to create an empty string).
- For each length `i` from 1 to `high`, compute `dp[i]` as `(dp[i-1] * 2) % MOD`.
- The result will be the sum of `dp[i]` for all `i` in the range `[low, high]`.

### Time Complexity
- The algorithm primarily consists of iterating from 1 to `high`, resulting in a time complexity of `O(high)`. 

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int countGoodStrings(int low, int high) {
        final int MOD = 1000000007;
        int[] dp = new int[high + 1];
        
        // Initial condition
        dp[0] = 1;
        
        for (int i = 1; i <= high; i++) {
            dp[i] = (dp[i - 1] * 2) % MOD;
        }
        
        long result = 0;
        for (int i = low; i <= high; i++) {
            result = (result + dp[i]) % MOD;
        }
        
        return (int) result;
    }
}
```

The above code defines a class `Solution` with a method `countGoodStrings` which:
1. Initializes the `dp` array to keep track of the number of good strings of each length up to `high`.
2. Updates the `dp` array such that `dp[i]` is `2` times `dp[i-1]`, modulo `10^9 + 7`.
3. Sums the values from `dp[low]` to `dp[high]` to get the total number of good strings of lengths in the specified range.

This approach ensures an efficient computation of the result, considering the large potential size of `high`.
