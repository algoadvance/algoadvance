[Leetcode 2147. Number of Ways to Divide a Long Corridor](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2147)
### Problem Statement

You are given a corridor represented as a string `corridor` of length `n`, where `corridor[i]` is either 'S' (representing a seat) or 'P' (representing a plant). You have to divide the corridor into non-overlapping parts by placing vertical dividers such that each part contains exactly two seats. You need to return the number of ways to place these dividers.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we return if it is impossible to divide the corridor to meet the requirement?**
   - If it is impossible to divide the corridor such that every part has exactly two seats, return `0`.

2. **What is the maximum length of the `corridor` string?**
   - The maximum length of the corridor string can be `10^5`.

3. **Are there any specific edge cases or constraints to consider?**
   - Cases where there are fewer than 2 seats (always return `0`).
   - Cases where the seats appear consecutively without plants in between.

### Strategy

1. **Counting the Seats:**
   - Traverse the corridor and count the number of seats (`S`). If the number of seats is not even, return `0` since we can't divide an odd number of seats into parts with exactly two seats each.

2. **Identifying Dividers:**
   - Where to place the dividers? We need to place a divider between each segment of exactly two seats. The valid segments are the gaps (represented by plants `P`) between every two segments of two seats.

3. **Calculate Ways:**
   - Traverse the corridor, and whenever you encounter a segment of two seats, count the plants between these segments and multiply the count to get the possible combinations.

4. **Return the Result:**
   - Return the calculated number of ways to divide the corridor.

### Code

```java
public class Solution {
    public int numberOfWays(String corridor) {
        int seatCount = 0;
        int n = corridor.length();
        
        // Count the number of seats
        for (char c : corridor.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == 'S') {
                seatCount++;
            }
        }
        
        // If the number of seats is not even, return 0
        if (seatCount % 2 != 0 || seatCount == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        long ways = 1;
        int seatSeen = 0;
        int plants = 0;
        
        for (char c : corridor.toCharArray()) {
            if (c == 'S') {
                if (seatSeen > 1 && seatSeen % 2 == 0) {
                    ways = (ways * (plants + 1)) % 1000000007;
                }
                seatSeen++;
                plants = 0;

            } else if (seatSeen > 0){  // This else condition ensures we only count plants after the first seat encountered
                plants++;
            }
        }
        
        return (int) ways;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The algorithm involves a single pass through the string for counting seats and another for calculating the number of ways, thus it runs in `O(n)` time, where `n` is the length of the string `corridor`.
- **Space Complexity:** The algorithm uses a constant amount of space, `O(1)`, as we are only using a few extra variables for counting.

This solution ensures that we efficiently count the possible ways to place dividers by leveraging the modulo operation for large number results and efficiently validating the number of seats.
