[Leetcode 2598. Smallest Missing Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2598)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `value`.

In a single operation, you can add `value` to any element of `nums`.

The smallest non-negative integer is a result of an infinite number of operations. You have to return the smallest missing non-negative integer that cannot be obtained after performing the given operations on the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are the elements in `nums` guaranteed to be integers?
   **A:** Yes, all elements in `nums` are integers.

2. **Q:** Can `value` be negative or zero?
   **A:** No, `value` is always a positive integer.

3. **Q:** What are the constraints on the size of `nums`?
   **A:** Constraints, like in typical coding problems, are not too large to fit into memory (usually up to 10^4 elements).

4. **Q:** Should I handle cases where `nums` is empty?
   **A:** Yes, handle such cases appropriately.

### Strategy

We can utilize the properties of modular arithmetic to track the remainders of elements when divided by `value`. Here's the plan:

1. **Modulo Operation:** For any number `n`, when we perform operations like \( n + k \cdot value \) for all integer `k`, the remainder of `n` mod `value` can represent the equivalence class.
  
2. **Remainder Check:** Track the smallest non-negative integer that cannot be formed by checking if all remainders from `0` to `value-1` appear at least once in the transformations.
  
3. **Missing Integer Identification:** Start from 0 and use a boolean array to check existence of smallest missing `x % value` for numbers formed by elements of `nums`.

### Code

```java
import java.util.HashSet;

public class Solution {
    public int findSmallestMissingInteger(int[] nums, int value) {
        HashSet<Integer> remainders = new HashSet<>();
        
        // Track all remainders mod value
        for (int num : nums) {
            int remainder = ((num % value) + value) % value; // Handle negative numbers
            remainders.add(remainder);
        }
        
        // Find the smallest missing non-negative integer        
        for (int i = 0; ; i++) {
            if (!remainders.contains(i % value)) {
                return i;
            }
        }
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[] nums = {1, 2, 3};
        int value = 4;
        System.out.println(solution.findSmallestMissingInteger(nums, value)); // Outputs: 0
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. This is because we iterate through the list to populate the remainders set, and the subsequent smallest missing integer check runs in constant time.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(min(k, n))` where `k` is the number of unique remainders possible `(0 to value-1)`. At most, we store `value` unique remainders.

With these steps and code, the solution effectively finds the smallest missing non-negative integer after the described operations.
