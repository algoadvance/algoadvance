[Leetcode 2439. Minimize Maximum of Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2439)
### Problem Statement

**Minimize Maximum of Array**

You are given an array `nums` of positive integers. In one operation, you can choose any element of the array and increase it by one.

Your task is to minimize the maximum value in the array after performing any number of operations, and return the minimum possible value of the maximum element in the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the size of the array?**
   - The problem does not specify constraints. Typically, constraints will be provided in the detailed problem statement on LeetCode. For now, let's assume the standard constraints.

2. **Can the operations be performed indefinitely?**
   - Yes, you can perform any number of operations.

3. **Are all elements in the array positive integers?**
   - Yes, as specified in the problem.

### Strategy

To minimize the maximum value of the array, we need to consider a strategy where the larger elements are gradually reduced by distributing their values to smaller elements.

A good approach here is a Binary Search method to figure out the minimal possible maximum value. The idea is to use a helper function to check if a given maximum value is achievable by performing the required operations.

#### Steps:
1. Set the initial range for the maximum value (`low` and `high`). `low` will start at 1, and `high` will be the maximum value in the array.
2. Perform binary search on this range. For each `mid` value in the binary search, use a helper function to check if it is feasible to achieve this `mid` value as the maximum value of the array.
3. The helper function will distribute the excess values to ensure no element exceeds the `mid` value.

### Code

```java
class Solution {
    public int minimizeArrayValue(int[] nums) {
        int low = 1;
        int high = 0;

        for (int num : nums) {
            high = Math.max(high, num);
        }

        while (low < high) {
            int mid = low + (low + high) / 2;
            if (canAchieveMaxValue(nums, mid)) {
                high = mid;
            } else {
                low = mid + 1;
            }
        }

        return low;
    }

    private boolean canAchieveMaxValue(int[] nums, int target) {
        long excess = 0;  // use long to avoid potential overflow

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num > target) {
                excess += num - target;
            } else {
                excess -= (target - num);
                
                if (excess < 0) {
                    excess = 0;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return excess == 0;
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Binary Search Initialization**: The `low` value starts from 1, and the `high` value is the maximum element in the array.
2. **Binary Search Loop**: Continue the loop until `low` is less than `high`.
   - Compute mid-point `mid`.
   - Check if it's possible to make all elements less than or equal to `mid` using the helper function.
   - Adjust `low` or `high` based on whether `mid` is achievable.
3. **Helper Function**:
   - Traverse through the array and reduce excess values from elements greater than `target`.
   - If `excess` can be distributed to make all elements less than or equal to `target`, return `true`.

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search**: `O(log(max_element))` where `max_element` is the maximum number in the array.
- **Helper Function**: `O(n)` for each binary search iteration where `n` is the size of the array.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n * log(max_element))`.
