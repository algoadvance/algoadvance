[Leetcode 2200. Find All K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2200)
### Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` and two integers `key` and `k`. A k-distant index is an index `i` of `nums` for which there exists at least one index `j` such that `|i - j| <= k` and `nums[j] == key`.

Return a list of all k-distant indices sorted in increasing order.

### Clarifying Questions
Before diving into the solution, it's good to ask a few clarifying questions:

1. **What is the range of values for `nums`, `key`, and `k`?**
   - Usually, the constraints are provided to limit the size for computation feasibility. 

2. **Can `nums` contain negative numbers or zeros?**
   - Depending on the context, `nums` could include negative numbers or zeros. It's essential to know for precise implementation.

3. **Are there any specific requirements on the size of the output list?**
   - This helps to understand if pagination or partial results are necessary.

4. **Should the indices be returned in sorted order even if they are already naturally sorted?**
   - This confirms how strictly we need to follow the described behavior.

### Strategy
To solve this problem:
1. Identify all indices `j` such that `nums[j] == key`.
2. For each such index `j`, mark indices `i` such that `|i - j| <= k`.
3. Use a data structure, like a set, to keep track of all unique indices and finally convert it to a sorted list.

### Code
Here's one way to implement the solution in Java:

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.HashSet;
import java.util.List;
import java.util.Set;

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> findKDistantIndices(int[] nums, int key, int k) {
        Set<Integer> resultSet = new HashSet<>();
        
        // Step 1: Identify all indices with nums[j] == key.
        for (int j = 0; j < nums.length; j++) {
            if (nums[j] == key) {
                // Step 2: Add all indices i such that |i - j| <= k.
                for (int i = Math.max(0, j - k); i <= Math.min(nums.length - 1, j + k); i++) {
                    resultSet.add(i);
                }
            }
        }
        
        // Step 3: Convert the set to a list and sort it.
        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>(resultSet);
        result.sort(Integer::compareTo); // Ensure the list is sorted in increasing order.
        
        return result;
    }

    // The driver code can be added here for testing the function.
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Identifying all indices for the key:** This takes `O(n)` time where `n` is the length of `nums`.
- **Marking k-distant indices:** In the worst case, this involves making `k` additions for each key index. This results in `O(m * k)` operations, where `m` is the number of key indices.
- **Sorting the resulting set:** Converting a set to a list and sorting it would take `O(p log p)` where `p` is the number of unique indices.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n + (m * k) + p log p)`, which simplifies to `O(n * k)` in the worst case, assuming that sorting dominates the other operations for large inputs.

In a typical scenario where `k` is much smaller than `n`, this approach is efficient and straightforward.
