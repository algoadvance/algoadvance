[Leetcode 326. Power of Three](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l326)
### Problem Statement

Determine if an integer \( n \) is a power of three. More specifically, check if there exists an integer \( x \) such that \( 3^x = n \).

**Example 1:**

- Input: \( n = 27 \)
- Output: True
- Explanation: \( 27 \) is \( 3^3 \).

**Example 2:**

- Input: \( n = 0 \)
- Output: False
- Explanation: \( 0 \) is not a power of three.

**Example 3:**

- Input: \( n = 9 \)
- Output: True
- Explanation: \( 9 \) is \( 3^2 \).

**Example 4:**

- Input: \( n = 45 \)
- Output: False
- Explanation: \( 45 \) is not a power of three.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the value of \( n \)?**
   - The value of \( n \) can be as large as \( 2^{31} - 1 \) (i.e., the maximum value of a signed 32-bit integer).

2. **Can \( n \) be negative?**
   - Yes, \( n \) can be negative. Negative numbers cannot be powers of three as \( 3^x \) where \( x \) is an integer is always positive.

### Strategy

To determine if \( n \) is a power of three, we can follow these strategies:

1. **Iterative Approach:**
   - Continuously divide \( n \) by 3. If \( n \) becomes 1 after repeated divisions by 3, it is a power of three. If at any step \( n \) is not divisible by 3 and isn't 1, then it is not a power of three.

2. **Mathematical Approach:**
   - Calculate the largest power of 3 within the 32-bit integer range, which is \( 3^{19} \) (since \( 3^{20} > 2^{31} - 1 \)). If \( n \) is a power of three, it must be a divisor of \( 3^{19} \).

We will implement the first method because it is more straightforward and easier to understand.

### Code

Hereâ€™s a solution using the iterative approach:

```java
public class Solution {
    public boolean isPowerOfThree(int n) {
        if (n <= 0) {
            return false;
        }
        while (n % 3 == 0) {
            n /= 3;
        }
        return n == 1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        System.out.println(solution.isPowerOfThree(27)); // true
        System.out.println(solution.isPowerOfThree(0));  // false
        System.out.println(solution.isPowerOfThree(9));  // true
        System.out.println(solution.isPowerOfThree(45)); // false
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(\log_3 n) \). In the worst case, we keep dividing \( n \) by 3 until it becomes 1, which takes \( \log_3 n \) divisions.
  
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(1) \). We only use a couple of variables for keeping track of \( n \) and the loop, so the space requirement is constant.

Feel free to ask any further questions or for additional clarifications!
