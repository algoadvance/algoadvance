[Leetcode 2396. Strictly Palindromic Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2396)
## Problem Statement

A number `n` is strictly palindromic if, for every base `b` from `2` to `n-2` (inclusive), the string representation of the number `n` in base `b` is a palindrome.

Given an integer `n`, return `true` if `n` is strictly palindromic and `false` otherwise.

**Example:**
``` 
Input: n = 9
Output: false 
```

**Constraints:**
- `4 <= n <= 10^5`

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is a palindrome?
   - A palindrome is a sequence that reads the same backward as forward.

2. What is meant by the string representation of the number in a particular base?
   - It means converting the number `n` from base 10 to another base `b`.

3. Should we consider bases that are not from `2` to `n-2`?
   - No, we only consider bases from `2` to `n-2`.

## Strategy

1. Convert the given number `n` to every base from `2` to `n-2`.
2. For each base conversion, check if the resultant number is a palindrome:
   - Convert the number to the respective base.
   - Check if the resultant string reads the same forwards and backwards.
3. Return `false` immediately if any of the conversions are not palindromic.
4. Return `true` if all conversions are palindromic.

## Code

I'll now provide the Java code to implement the above strategy.

```java
public class StrictlyPalindromicNumber {
    
    public boolean isStrictlyPalindromic(int n) {
        for (int base = 2; base <= n - 2; base++) {
            if (!isPalindromeInBase(n, base)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    private boolean isPalindromeInBase(int num, int base) {
        String converted = convertToBase(num, base);
        return isPalindromeString(converted);
    }
    
    private String convertToBase(int num, int base) {
        StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
        while (num > 0) {
            sb.append(num % base);
            num /= base;
        }
        return sb.reverse().toString();
    }

    private boolean isPalindromeString(String s) {
        int left = 0, right = s.length() - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            if (s.charAt(left) != s.charAt(right)) {
                return false;
            }
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        return true;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StrictlyPalindromicNumber spn = new StrictlyPalindromicNumber();
        System.out.println(spn.isStrictlyPalindromic(9)); // Output: false
        System.out.println(spn.isStrictlyPalindromic(4)); // Output: false
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- `convertToBase` method runs in O(log_b(n)), where `b` is the base.
- `isPalindromeString` method runs in O(k), where `k` is the length of the string.
- The `isStrictlyPalindromic` method iterates from base 2 to `n-2`, which means there are (n-3) calls to `isPalindromeInBase`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is approximately O(n * log(n)) in the worst case, considering base conversions and palindrome checks.

However, it's worth mentioning that there are mathematical proofs stating there are no numbers greater than 4 which are strictly palindromic; thus, every number `n >= 4` should return `false`. The implementation provided above nonetheless follows the process described in the problem statement.
