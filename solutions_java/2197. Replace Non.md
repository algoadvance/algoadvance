[Leetcode 2197. Replace Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2197)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums`. Perform the following operation on it until the list contains only co-prime numbers:
1. Choose any two adjacent integers in the list.
2. If their greatest common divisor (GCD) is greater than 1, replace them with their least common multiple (LCM), and remove the chosen integers from the list.

Return the final array when the list no longer contains adjacent integers with a GCD greater than 1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are all elements in the array guaranteed to be positive integers?
   - **A:** Yes, all elements in the array are positive integers.

2. **Q:** Can the array be empty or contain only one element?
   - **A:** Yes, it is possible, and in such cases, the array should be returned as is.

3. **Q:** Is there a preferred order to perform the replacements, or can they be done in any order?
   - **A:** The replacements can be performed in any order, but typically we'll process from left to right.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize**: Start with the first element of the array, and use a stack to keep track of the processed elements.
2. **Process**: Iterate through each element in the array:
   - If the stack is empty, push the current element onto the stack.
   - If the stack is not empty, check the GCD of the top element of the stack and the current element.
     - If the GCD is greater than 1, replace the top element of the stack with the LCM of the two, and continue checking new pair with the new top of the stack.
     - If the GCD is 1, push the current element to the stack.
3. **Repeat**: Once all elements are processed, the stack will contain the final array.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;
import java.math.BigInteger;

public class Solution {
    public List<Integer> replaceNonCoprimes(List<Integer> nums) {
        Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();
        
        // Helper function to compute LCM
        long lcm(long a, long b) {
            return (a * b) / gcd(a, b);
        }

        // Helper function to compute GCD
        long gcd(long a, long b) {
            return BigInteger.valueOf(a).gcd(BigInteger.valueOf(b)).longValue();
        }

        for (int num : nums) {
            while (!stack.isEmpty() && gcd(stack.peek(), num) > 1) {
                num = (int) lcm(stack.pop(), num);
            }
            stack.push(num);
        }
        
        return new ArrayList<>(stack);
    }
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: We initialize a stack to store the final result.
2. **Processing**:
   - We iterate through each element in the `nums` list.
   - For each number, we check the GCD with the element on the top of the stack.
   - If the GCD is greater than 1, this means the numbers are not co-prime. We replace the two numbers with their LCM.
   - Continue until the stack is either empty or the GCD of the top element and the current number is 1.
   - Push the current number to the stack.
3. **Output**: The stack contains the final list of co-prime numbers.

### Time Complexity

- **GCD Calculation**: Each GCD calculation is \(O(\log(\min(a, b)))\).
- **LCM Calculation**: Each LCM calculation leverages GCD and results in \(O(\log(\min(a, b)))\).
- **Iteration**: Each element is processed once, and each element can be involved in GCD and LCM operations several times in the worst case.
  
Therefore, in the worst case, the time complexity is approximately \(O(n \log(\text{max element}))\), where `n` is the length of the list.
