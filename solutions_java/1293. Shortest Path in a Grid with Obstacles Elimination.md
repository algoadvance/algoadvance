[Leetcode 1293. Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1293)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` grid, where each cell is either `0` (empty) or `1` (obstacle). You can move up, down, left, or right from and to an empty cell in one step.

- Return the minimum number of steps to walk from the upper-left corner `(0, 0)` to the lower-right corner `(m-1, n-1)` given that you can eliminate at most `k` obstacles. 
- If it is not possible to find such a walk, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are diagonal movements allowed?**
   - No, movements are restricted to up, down, left, and right.
   
2. **Can the starting or ending cell be an obstacle?**
   - No, the problem guarantees that the start `(0, 0)` and the end `(m-1, n-1)` are empty cells.

3. **What are the constraints of `m`, `n`, and `k`?**
   - Typically, `m` and `n` are up to 40, and `k` can be very large, but practical limits should be considered for performance.

### Strategy

We can use a modified Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm to solve this problem. The BFS approach is suitable because it explores paths level by level and is capable of finding the shortest path in unweighted grids.

To handle the obstacle elimination, we will keep track of the number of obstacles we have eliminated so far in addition to the coordinates in our BFS queue.

Each state in the BFS will be represented by `(x, y, remaining_k)`, where:
- `x` and `y` are the current coordinates.
- `remaining_k` is the number of obstacles we can still eliminate.

We will use a `visited` set to store the states we have already processed to avoid redundant work and potential infinite loops.

### Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    private static final int[][] DIRECTIONS = {{0, 1}, {1, 0}, {0, -1}, {-1, 0}};
    
    public int shortestPath(int[][] grid, int k) {
        int m = grid.length;
        int n = grid[0].length;
        
        // Edge case: Starting point is the same as ending point
        if (m == 1 && n == 1) return 0;
        
        boolean[][][] visited = new boolean[m][n][k + 1];
        Queue<int[]> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(new int[]{0, 0, k});
        visited[0][0][k] = true;
        
        int steps = 0;
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            steps++;
            int size = queue.size();
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                int[] current = queue.poll();
                int x = current[0];
                int y = current[1];
                int remainingK = current[2];
                
                // Explore all 4 possible directions
                for (int[] direction : DIRECTIONS) {
                    int newX = x + direction[0];
                    int newY = y + direction[1];
                    
                    // Check bounds
                    if (newX < 0 || newX >= m || newY < 0 || newY >= n) continue;
                    
                    // Check if we've reached the destination
                    if (newX == m - 1 && newY == n - 1) return steps;
                    
                    int newK = remainingK - grid[newX][newY];
                    if (newK >= 0 && !visited[newX][newY][newK]) {
                        queue.offer(new int[]{newX, newY, newK});
                        visited[newX][newY][newK] = true;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int[][] grid = {
            {0, 1, 1},
            {1, 1, 0},
            {1, 1, 0}
        };
        int k = 1;
        System.out.println(solution.shortestPath(grid, k));  // Expected output: 6
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(m \cdot n \cdot k)\)
  - BFS explores each cell with a different remaining obstacle elimination state, leading to a worst-case scenario where we need to evaluate each cell with all possible states of `k`.
  
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(m \cdot n \cdot k)\)
  - Storage is needed for the `visited` states and the BFS queue.

This solution ensures that we effectively cover all possible paths and eliminate unnecessary recomputation by keeping track of visited states.
