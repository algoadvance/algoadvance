[Leetcode 1567. Maximum Length of Subarray With Positive Product](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1567)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums`, find the maximum length of a subarray where the product of all its elements is positive.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the array contain zero or negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the array can contain both zero and negative numbers.
   
2. **What value should we return if there's no subarray with a positive product?**
   - If there's no subarray where the product of all its elements is positive, we should return `0`.

3. **What size can the array be?**
   - The array can be of any size from `1` to `10^5`.
   
### Strategy
1. **Track Two States:**
   - We need to keep track of the length of the current subarray ending at each position, with two different states:
     - `posLen` representing the maximum length of a subarray ending at the current position with a positive product.
     - `negLen` representing the maximum length of a subarray ending at the current position with a negative product.
     
2. **Iterate Through the Array:**
   - For each element in the array, update `posLen` and `negLen` based on the value of the current element:
     - If the current element is positive, it might extend a positive subarray or start a new positive subarray.
     - If the current element is negative, it might turn a formerly negative subarray positive (if there was such a subarray).
     - If the current element is zero, reset both `posLen` and `negLen` to zero as products involving zeroes would not be positive nor negative.
     
3. **Update the Maximum Length:**
   - Keep track of the maximum value of `posLen` throughout the array, which will be the desired answer.

### Code
```java
public class Solution {
    public int getMaxLen(int[] nums) {
        int n = nums.length;
        int posLen = 0;  // Length of subarray with positive product
        int negLen = 0;  // Length of subarray with negative product
        int maxLength = 0;  // Maximum length of subarray with positive product

        for (int num : nums) {
            if (num == 0) {
                posLen = 0;
                negLen = 0;
            } else if (num > 0) {
                posLen++;
                negLen = negLen == 0 ? 0 : negLen + 1;
            } else { // num < 0
                int temp = posLen;
                posLen = negLen == 0 ? 0 : negLen + 1;
                negLen = temp + 1;
            }
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, posLen);
        }

        return maxLength;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **O(n)**: We go through the array once, updating our state variables (`posLen`, `negLen`) as well as the `maxLength`. Therefore, the time complexity is linear with respect to the length of the array.

### Summary
- The solution involves tracking subarray lengths with positive and negative products independently.
- By iterating through the array once, we update and maintain the required values, ensuring an optimal time complexity of `O(n)`.
