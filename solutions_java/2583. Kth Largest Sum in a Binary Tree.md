[Leetcode 2583. Kth Largest Sum in a Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2583)
## Problem Statement

You are given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `k`. You need to return the `kth` largest sum of values among all levels of the binary tree. 

If there are fewer than `k` levels in the tree, return `-1`.

### Example:
```
Input: root = [5,8,9,2,1,6,4], k = 2
Output: 17
Explanation: The sums of each level are:
- Level 0: 5
- Level 1: 8 + 9 = 17
- Level 2: 2 + 1 + 6 + 4 = 13
The 2nd largest sum among all levels is 17.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the definition of a level in the tree?**
   - Each level of the tree contains nodes that are equidistant from the root.
   
2. **How are the levels indexed?**
   - Levels are zero-indexed. The root node is at level 0, its children are at level 1, and so on.
   
3. **Can the binary tree be null?**
   - No, the problem assumes that the tree has at least one node.

4. **What is the range of values for the node values and `k`?**
   - The problem does not specify explicit constraints but generally assume a broad range for typical binary tree problems.
   
5. **Are the node values allowed to be negative?**
   - Yes, node values can be negative.

## Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** 
   - Traverse the tree level by level.
   - For each level, calculate the sum of its node values.
  
2. **Store Level Sums:**
   - Store these sums in a list.

3. **Find the `kth` Largest Sum:**
   - Sort the list of sums in descending order.
   - If there are fewer than `k` levels, return `-1`.
   - Otherwise, return the `k-th` largest sum.

## Code

```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    public int kthLargestLevelSum(TreeNode root, int k) {
        if (root == null) {
            return -1; // Tree is empty
        }
        
        Queue<TreeNode> queue = new LinkedList<>();
        queue.offer(root);
        
        List<Integer> levelSums = new ArrayList<>();
        
        while (!queue.isEmpty()) {
            int levelSize = queue.size();
            int levelSum = 0;
            
            for (int i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
                TreeNode currentNode = queue.poll();
                levelSum += currentNode.val;
                
                if (currentNode.left != null) {
                    queue.offer(currentNode.left);
                }
                
                if (currentNode.right != null) {
                    queue.offer(currentNode.right);
                }
            }
            
            levelSums.add(levelSum);
        }
        
        // Sort the sums in descending order
        Collections.sort(levelSums, Collections.reverseOrder());
        
        // Check if k is within the bounds of the list size
        if (k > levelSums.size()) {
            return -1;
        }
        
        return levelSums.get(k - 1);
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **BFS Traversal:**
   - Each node is visited once, so the time complexity is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the tree.
   
2. **Sorting:**
   - Sorting the sums of levels has a time complexity of \(O(L \log L)\), where \(L\) is the number of levels in the tree.
   
Combining these, the overall time complexity is \(O(n + L \log L)\). However, since the number of levels \(L\) is generally much smaller than the number of nodes \(n\), the traversal \(O(n)\) typically dominates.

**Space Complexity:**
- \(O(L)\) for storing level sums.
- \(O(n)\) for the BFS queue. 

The space complexity is dominated by \(O(n)\).

This solution provides an efficient way to find the `k-th` largest level sum in a binary tree using BFS and sorting.
