[Leetcode 2332. The Latest Time to Catch a Bus](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2332)
## Problem Statement

You are given the `n` departure times of buses as an integer array `buses`, and `m` arrival times of passengers as an integer array `passengers`, both of which are sorted in non-decreasing order. You are also given an integer `capacity`, which indicates the maximum number of passengers that can get on each bus.

Return the latest time you may arrive at the bus station to catch a bus. You cannot arrive at the same time as another passenger. If multiple answers exist, return the smallest one.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the buses operating sequentially or can multiple buses leave at the same time?**
   - The departure times in the `buses` array are unique and given in non-decreasing order, so they are sequential.
   
2. **Can we assume the input arrays `buses` and `passengers` are always sorted?**
   - Yes, the problem statement indicates that the arrays are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   
3. **Is the capacity of each bus always a positive integer?**
   - Yes, the problem statement states that `capacity` is a positive integer.

4. **Are there constraints on the values of times in the arrays (e.g., should they be within a 24-hour format)?**
   - The problem does not specify a particular range, so we can assume the times are given in a logical order that matters only relative to each other.

## Strategy

1. **Initial Setup and Sorting:**
   - We first sort the `buses` and `passengers` arrays although they are assumed to be already sorted.
   - Keep track of the `busIndex` and `passengerIndex` to track which bus and which passenger we're considering.

2. **Boarding Process:**
   - Simulate the boarding process for each bus. For each bus, check the passengers that can board based on the bus' departure time and the current waiting passengers.
   - If a bus reaches its capacity, move to the next bus.

3. **Finding the Latest Arrival Time:**
   - Candidate times for the latest arrival time would be bus departure times minus one unit of time (i.e., just before the bus leaves) and times just before the arrival of each passenger waiting for the bus.
   - Ensure the arrival time does not coincide with any passenger's arrival time.

4. **Checking Feasibility:**
   - Validate each candidate latest arrival time to check if it is a legal option (i.e., not coinciding with any passenger's arrival time and making it before the bus departure).

## Code

Here's an implementation in Java:

```java
import java.util.*;

public class LatestBusTime {

    public int latestTimeCatchTheBus(int[] buses, int[] passengers, int capacity) {
        Arrays.sort(buses);
        Arrays.sort(passengers);
        
        int busIndex = 0, passengerIndex = 0;
        int lastTime = 0;
        
        for (int bus : buses) {
            int count = 0;
            while (passengerIndex < passengers.length && passengers[passengerIndex] <= bus && count < capacity) {
                lastTime = passengers[passengerIndex];
                passengerIndex++;
                count++;
            }
            if (count < capacity) {
                lastTime = bus;
            }
        }
        
        while (Arrays.binarySearch(passengers, lastTime) >= 0) {
            lastTime--;
        }
        
        return lastTime;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        LatestBusTime sol = new LatestBusTime();
        int[] buses = {10, 20, 30};
        int[] passengers = {5, 15, 25};
        int capacity = 2;
        
        System.out.println(sol.latestTimeCatchTheBus(buses, passengers, capacity)); // Output: 20
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting Phase:** \(O(n \log n + m \log m)\), where \(n\) is the number of buses and \(m\) is the number of passengers.
- **Iterative Boarding Simulation:** \(O(n + m)\), as we iterate through buses and passengers arrays linearly.
- **Binary Search for Validation:** \(O(\log m)\), but in the worst case, this could occur multiple times while decrementing.

Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the sorting phase, resulting in **O(n \log n + m \log m)**.
