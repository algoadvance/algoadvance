[Leetcode 835. Image Overlap](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l835)
### Problem Statement

You are given two binary matrices `img1` and `img2` each of size `n x n`. An image overlap is the number of positions that have a `1` in both matrices. We need to translate one of the images in each of the eight possible directions (left, right, up, down) and count the maximum number of overlapping `1`s for any such translation of one image over the other.

Implement a function `int largestOverlap(int[][] img1, int[][] img2)` that returns the maximum number of overlapping 1's.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the size of the matrices always the same and a square matrix?**
   - Yes, both matrices are always square matrices of the same size `n x n`.
   
2. **Can the matrices contain any values other than 0 and 1?**
   - No, the matrices will only contain binary values, i.e., 0s and 1s.
   
3. **What are the possible values for n?**
   - Generally, `n` could range from 1 to 30 given typical constraints for interview scenarios.

### Strategy

We will use a combination of brute-force and clever shifting to solve the problem effectively:
1. **Shifting and Counting Overlaps:** We will shift one matrix over the other in all possible directions and at each shift, count the number of overlaps of `1`s.
2. **Using Offsets:** Instead of moving the matrices, calculate the offsets and simulate the displacement using the indices.
3. **Maintain Maximum Overlap:** Track the maximum overlap observed over all possible translations.

### Pseudocode
1. Initialize the `maxCount` to keep track of the maximum overlap.
2. Iterate through all possible offsets (dy, dx) where `dy` and `dx` are integer values ranging from `-(n-1)` to `n-1`.
3. For each offset, calculate the number of overlapping 1's between `img1` and the shifted `img2`.
4. Update the `maxCount` whenever a higher overlap count is found.
5. Return the `maxCount`.

### Code

```java
public class ImageOverlap {
    public int largestOverlap(int[][] img1, int[][] img2) {
        int n = img1.length;
        int maxCount = 0;

        for (int dy = -n + 1; dy < n; dy++) {
            for (int dx = -n + 1; dx < n; dx++) {
                maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, countOverlap(img1, img2, dy, dx));
            }
        }

        return maxCount;
    }

    private int countOverlap(int[][] img1, int[][] img2, int dy, int dx) {
        int n = img1.length;
        int overlap = 0;
        for (int y = 0; y < n; y++) {
            for (int x = 0; x < n; x++) {
                if (y + dy < 0 || y + dy >= n || x + dx < 0 || x + dx >= n) {
                    continue;
                }
                if (img1[y][x] == 1 && img2[y + dy][x + dx] == 1) {
                    overlap++;
                }
            }
        }
        return overlap;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        ImageOverlap io = new ImageOverlap();
        int[][] img1 = {
                {1, 1, 0},
                {0, 1, 0},
                {0, 1, 0}
        };
        int[][] img2 = {
                {0, 0, 0},
                {0, 1, 1},
                {0, 0, 1}
        };
        
        System.out.println(io.largestOverlap(img1, img2));  // Output should be 3
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(n^4)** where `n` is the size of the matrix:
1. Outer loops iterate over all possible offsets: `(n-1) to (n-1)` results in **O(n^2)** combinations.
2. Inner loops count the overlap values for each offset, requiring **O(n^2)** operations.

Thus, the total complexity is **O(n^4)**. While this may seem high, it is typically manageable for n up to around 30, given typical interview constraints.
