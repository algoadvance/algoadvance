[Leetcode 679. 24 Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l679)
## Problem Statement
You are given an array of four integers, each between 1 and 9 (inclusive). You need to determine if you can reach the number 24 by performing addition (`+`), subtraction (`-`), multiplication (`*`), or division (`/`) operations on the array's elements and by grouping the operations however you wish. Each integer must be used exactly once. Return `true` if you can achieve 24 and `false` otherwise.

### Example
```text
Input: [4, 1, 8, 7]
Output: true
Explanation: (8-4) * (7-1) = 24
```

```text
Input: [1, 2, 1, 2]
Output: false
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can we use floating-point division?**
   - Yes, but the result should be strictly 24.0 (with a small epsilon for floating-point comparison).

2. **Are the array elements always integers between 1 and 9?**
   - Yes.

## Strategy
1. **Enumerate All Possibilities**: Generate all permutations of the numbers to consider every possible order in which we can perform the operations.
2. **Try Every Combination of Operations**: For each permutation, try every combination of arithmetic operations between the numbers. This includes trying different groupings of operations, which means trying various ways to parenthesize the operations.
3. **Floating-Point Precision**: Due to the floating-point division, we need to account for precision issues.

## Code

```java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Arrays;
import java.util.List;

public class Solution {
    private static final double EPSILON = 1e-6;
    private static final int TARGET = 24;

    public boolean judgePoint24(int[] nums) {
        List<Double> list = new ArrayList<>();
        for (int num : nums) {
            list.add((double) num);
        }
        return solve(list);
    }
    
    private boolean solve(List<Double> nums) {
        if (nums.size() == 1) {
            return Math.abs(nums.get(0) - TARGET) < EPSILON;
        }
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.size(); i++) {
            for (int j = 0; j < nums.size(); j++) {
                if (i != j) {
                    List<Double> nextRound = new ArrayList<>();
                    for (int k = 0; k < nums.size(); k++) {
                        if (k != i && k != j) {
                            nextRound.add(nums.get(k));
                        }
                    }
                    for (double next : compute(nums.get(i), nums.get(j))) {
                        nextRound.add(next);
                        if (solve(nextRound)) return true;
                        nextRound.remove(nextRound.size() - 1);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    private List<Double> compute(double a, double b) {
        List<Double> results = new ArrayList<>();
        results.add(a + b);
        results.add(a - b);
        results.add(b - a);
        results.add(a * b);
        if (Math.abs(b) > EPSILON) results.add(a / b);
        if (Math.abs(a) > EPSILON) results.add(b / a);
        return results;
    }
    
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution sol = new Solution();
        System.out.println(sol.judgePoint24(new int[]{4, 1, 8, 7})); // true
        System.out.println(sol.judgePoint24(new int[]{1, 2, 1, 2})); // false
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Permutation Generation**: There are \(4!\) (24) permutations of 4 numbers.
2. **Operation Combinations**: Each combination involves choosing two numbers and recursively solving the problem with 3, 2, and finally 1 number left.
3. **Operations Per Pair**: For each pair of numbers, there are 6 possible results (sum, difference in both orders, product, division in both orders).

**Overall Complexity**: The code can be evaluated as having a worst-case exponential complexity due to the recursive exploration of all possible combinations, resulting in \(O(6^4 \times 4!) = O(24 \times 1296) \approx O(31104)\).

In practice, given the constraints (numbers 1 through 9 and only 4 numbers), this brute-force approach is feasible.
