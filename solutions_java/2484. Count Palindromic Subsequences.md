[Leetcode 2484. Count Palindromic Subsequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2484)
## Problem Statement
Given a string `s` of lowercase English letters, return the number of palindromic subsequences of length 5 in the string.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. A string is called a palindrome if it reads the same forward and backward.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints on the input string `s`**: 
   - Is there a maximum length for the string?
   - Are all characters guaranteed to be lowercase English letters?
   
2. **Expected Output**:
   - Do we return the count as an integer?

*Assuming typical constraints for LeetCode problems:*
- The length of `s` is between 1 and 2000.
- All characters in `s` are lowercase English letters.

## Strategy
1. **Brute Force**:
   - Generate all possible subsequences of length 5 from `s` and check if they are palindromes.
   - This approach will be computationally infeasible for long strings due to the combinatorial explosion.

2. **Dynamic programming with combinatorics**:
   - We recognize that directly generating subsequences will be too slow.
   - Instead, we'll leverage the properties of palindromes and use dynamic programming to build our solution.
   - We'll consider counts of subsequences ending at each position and use a sliding window approach combined with a two-pointer technique to efficiently count palindromic subsequences.

## Code
Here's an implementation of the described strategy in Java:

```java
class Solution {
    public int countPalindromicSubsequences(String s) {
        int n = s.length();
        if (n < 5) return 0;
        
        int[][] dp = new int[n][n];
        int mod = 1_000_000_007;
        
        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            dp[i][i] = 1; // Single character palindromes
        }

        for (int len = 2; len <= n; len++) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - len; i++) {
                int j = i + len - 1;
                if (s.charAt(i) == s.charAt(j)) {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] * 2;
                    int l = i + 1, r = j - 1;
                    while (l <= r && s.charAt(l) != s.charAt(i)) l++;
                    while (l <= r && s.charAt(r) != s.charAt(j)) r--;
                    if (l < r) {
                        dp[i][j] -= dp[l + 1][r - 1];
                    } else if (l == r) {
                        dp[i][j] += 1;
                    } else {
                        dp[i][j] += 2;
                    }
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j] + dp[i][j - 1] - dp[i + 1][j - 1];
                }
                dp[i][j] = (dp[i][j] + mod) % mod;
            }
        }
        
        int count = 0;
        for (int len = 5; len <= n; len++) {
            for (int i = 0; i <= n - len; i++) {
                int j = i + len - 1;
                if (isPalindrome(s, i, j)) {
                    count = (count + dp[i][j]) % mod;
                }
            }
        }
        
        return count;
    }
    
    private boolean isPalindrome(String s, int i, int j) {
        while (i < j) {
            if (s.charAt(i) != s.charAt(j)) return false;
            i++;
            j--;
        }
        return true;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity
- The dynamic programming table `dp` requires O(n^2) space.
- Filling up the DP table requires O(n^3) time in the worst case due to nested loops.
- Checking 5-length subsequences similarly requires O(n^3) in the worst case.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n^3) with O(n^2) space complexity. This solution should be efficient enough for a typical input size constraint (up to 2000 characters).
