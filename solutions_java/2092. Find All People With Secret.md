[Leetcode 2092. Find All People With Secret](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2092)
### Problem Statement
Leetcode Problem 2092: **Find All People With Secret**

You are given an integer `n` indicating the number of people. You are also given a 2D integer array meetings where `meetings[i] = [xi, yi, timei]` indicates that person `xi` and person `yi` have a meeting at time `timei`. A person may attend multiple meetings at different times. All meetings are scheduled in chronological order by their `timei` values. Additionally, you are given an integer `firstPerson` that initially knows the secret. You want to find all the people who know the secret after all the meetings. Return the list of these people sorted in ascending order.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: Are there any constraints on the size of `n` and the number of meetings?**
   **A: Yes, the number of people `n` can be up to 10^5, and the number of meetings can also be up to 10^5.**
   
2. **Q: Can meetings between the same two people happen more than once?**
   **A: Yes, the same pair of people can meet multiple times at different times.**
   
3. **Q: Do we need to consider if the input meetings are not pre-sorted by time?**
   **A: The problem statement indicates that meetings are given in chronological order.**

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a Union-Find data structure to keep track of groups of people who get to know the secret. Initially, only person `0` and `firstPerson` know the secret. For each meeting, if any of the attendees know the secret, both people will know the secret. We process the meetings in chronological order and unite the groups accordingly:

1. **Union-Find Data Structure**:
    - **Find**: Function to find the root representative of a group.
    - **Union**: Function to unite two groups.
    
2. **Processing Meetings**:
    - Iterate over the meetings.
    - Use union-find to merge the sets.
    - After processing all meetings at the current time, check the groups to propagate the secret knowledge.

### Code
```java
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {
    class UnionFind {
        int[] parent;
        int[] rank;

        public UnionFind(int size) {
            parent = new int[size];
            rank = new int[size];
            for (int i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                parent[i] = i;
                rank[i] = 1;
            }
        }

        public int find(int x) {
            if (parent[x] != x) {
                parent[x] = find(parent[x]);
            }
            return parent[x];
        }

        public void union(int x, int y) {
            int rootX = find(x);
            int rootY = find(y);

            if (rootX != rootY) {
                if (rank[rootX] > rank[rootY]) {
                    parent[rootY] = rootX;
                } else if (rank[rootX] < rank[rootY]) {
                    parent[rootX] = rootY;
                } else {
                    parent[rootY] = rootX;
                    rank[rootX]++;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    public List<Integer> findAllPeople(int n, int[][] meetings, int firstPerson) {
        UnionFind uf = new UnionFind(n);
        uf.union(0, firstPerson); // person 0 and firstPerson initially know the secret

        // Sort meetings by time (unnecessary if guaranteed sorted)
        Arrays.sort(meetings, (a, b) -> Integer.compare(a[2], b[2]));

        Map<Integer, List<int[]>> timeMeetingsMap = new HashMap<>();
        for (int[] meeting : meetings) {
            timeMeetingsMap.computeIfAbsent(meeting[2], k -> new ArrayList<>()).add(meeting);
        }

        Set<Integer> secretKeepers = new HashSet<>(Arrays.asList(0, firstPerson));

        for (int time : timeMeetingsMap.keySet()) {
            Map<Integer, List<Integer>> timeComponents = new HashMap<>();

            for (int[] meeting : timeMeetingsMap.get(time)) {
                int x = meeting[0];
                int y = meeting[1];
                if (!timeComponents.containsKey(uf.find(x))) {
                    timeComponents.put(uf.find(x), new ArrayList<>());
                }
                if (!timeComponents.containsKey(uf.find(y))) {
                    timeComponents.put(uf.find(y), new ArrayList<>());
                }
                timeComponents.get(uf.find(x)).add(x);
                timeComponents.get(uf.find(y)).add(y);
                uf.union(x, y);
            }

            for (int key : timeComponents.keySet()) {
                boolean secretKnownInComponent = false;
                for (int person : timeComponents.get(key)) {
                    if (secretKeepers.contains(person)) {
                        secretKnownInComponent = true;
                        break;
                    }
                }

                if (secretKnownInComponent) {
                    for (int person : timeComponents.get(key)) {
                        secretKeepers.add(person);
                    }
                } else {
                    for (int person : timeComponents.get(key)) {
                        uf.parent[person] = person; // Reset the union-find
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        List<Integer> result = new ArrayList<>(secretKeepers);
        Collections.sort(result);
        return result;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Solution solution = new Solution();
        int n = 6;
        int[][] meetings = { {1, 2, 5}, {2, 3, 8}, {1, 5, 10} };
        int firstPerson = 1;
        System.out.println(solution.findAllPeople(n, meetings, firstPerson)); // Output: [0, 1, 2, 3, 5]
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Union-Find Operations**: Each union and find operation can be considered nearly constant time, denoted by `O(α(n))`, where `α` is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows very slowly.
- **Processing all Meetings**: Each meeting is processed once in a loop, hence the time complexity is `O(m * α(n))`, where `m` is the number of meetings.

Given the constraints, this approach will efficiently compute the solution.
