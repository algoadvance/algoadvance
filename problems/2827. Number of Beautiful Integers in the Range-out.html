Leetcode Question: 2827

                ***********************************************<div id="title">2827. Number of Beautiful Integers in the Range</div>
***********************************************<div class="elfjS" data-track-load="description_content"><p>You are given positive integers <code>low</code>, <code>high</code>, and <code>k</code>.</p>
<p>A number is <strong>beautiful</strong> if it meets both of the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
<li>The count of even digits in the number is equal to the count of odd digits.</li>
<li>The number is divisible by <code>k</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Return <em>the number of beautiful integers in the range</em> <code>[low, high]</code>.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><strong class="example">Example 1:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> low = 10, high = 20, k = 3
<strong>Output:</strong> 2
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are 2 beautiful integers in the given range: [12,18]. 
- 12 is beautiful because it contains 1 odd digit and 1 even digit, and is divisible by k = 3.
- 18 is beautiful because it contains 1 odd digit and 1 even digit, and is divisible by k = 3.
Additionally we can see that:
- 16 is not beautiful because it is not divisible by k = 3.
- 15 is not beautiful because it does not contain equal counts even and odd digits.
It can be shown that there are only 2 beautiful integers in the given range.
</pre>
<p><strong class="example">Example 2:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> low = 1, high = 10, k = 1
<strong>Output:</strong> 1
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There is 1 beautiful integer in the given range: [10].
- 10 is beautiful because it contains 1 odd digit and 1 even digit, and is divisible by k = 1.
It can be shown that there is only 1 beautiful integer in the given range.
</pre>
<p><strong class="example">Example 3:</strong></p>
<pre><strong>Input:</strong> low = 5, high = 5, k = 2
<strong>Output:</strong> 0
<strong>Explanation:</strong> There are 0 beautiful integers in the given range.
- 5 is not beautiful because it is not divisible by k = 2 and it does not contain equal even and odd digits.
</pre>
<p> </p>
<p><strong>Constraints:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><code>0 &lt; low &lt;= high &lt;= 10<sup>9</sup></code></li>
<li><code>0 &lt; k &lt;= 20</code></li>
</ul>
