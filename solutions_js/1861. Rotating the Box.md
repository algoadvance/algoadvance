[Leetcode 1861. Rotating the Box](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1861)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` matrix `box` representing a side-view of a box. Each cell of the box is one of the following:

- A stone (`'#'`)
- A stationary obstacle (`'*'`)
- Empty (`'.'`)

The box is rotated 90 degrees clockwise, causing some of the stones to fall due to gravity. You need to return the box after it has been rotated.

### Constraints:
- `m == box.length`
- `n == box[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 500`
- `box[i][j]` is either `'#'`, `'*'`, or `'.'`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can obstacles (`'*'`) move during rotation?
   - No, obstacles remain stationary and should not be moved by either rotation or gravity.
   
2. Should stones (i.e., `'#'`) fall as far down as possible in the new orientation?
   - Yes, after rotating the box 90 degrees clockwise, stones should fall as far down as possible under the influence of gravity, stopping when they encounter an obstacle or the bottom of the box.

## Strategy

1. Implement a function to rotate the box 90 degrees clockwise.
2. For each column in the rotated box, process from bottom to top to simulate the effect of gravity on the stones (`'#'`).
3. For each position in the new rotated box, if it contains a stone, look for the lowest available position in the current column (until an obstacle or the bottom is reached).

## Code

Let's write the function to rotate the box and then simulate the falling stones due to gravity.

```javascript
function rotateTheBox(box) {
    const m = box.length;
    const n = box[0].length;
    
    // Step 1: Create the rotated box with dimensions n x m
    const rotatedBox = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(m).fill('.'));
    
    // Step 2: Rotate the box 90 degrees clockwise
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            rotatedBox[j][m - i - 1] = box[i][j];
        }
    }
    
    // Step 3: Simulate gravity in the rotated box
    for (let col = 0; col < m; col++) {
        let emptyRow = n - 1;
        for (let row = n - 1; row >= 0; row--) {
            if (rotatedBox[row][col] === '#') {
                rotatedBox[row][col] = '.';
                rotatedBox[emptyRow][col] = '#';
                emptyRow--;
            } else if (rotatedBox[row][col] === '*') {
                emptyRow = row - 1;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return rotatedBox;
}

// Example usage:
const box = [
    ['#', '.', '#'],
    ['#', '*', '.'],
    ['#', '#', '*']
];
console.log(rotateTheBox(box));
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Rotation Step: O(m * n)** - We traverse each cell exactly once to perform the rotation.
2. **Gravity Simulation Step: O(m * n)** - We perform a single pass through each column to simulate gravity.

So, the overall time complexity is O(m * n).

Given the constraints `1 <= m, n <= 500`, this complexity is efficient and should perform well within the input limits.
