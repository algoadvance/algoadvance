[Leetcode 198. House Robber](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l198)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` representing the amount of money of each house. Thieves are planning to rob houses along a street, deciding between robbing any two adjacent houses, as doing so would alert the police. Your task is to determine the maximum amount of money you can rob without alerting the police.

**Constraints:** 
- \( 1 \leq \text{nums.length} \leq 100 \)
- \( 0 \leq \text{nums[i]} \leq 400 \)

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: What is the minimum input size?**
   - A: The minimum input size is 1, meaning there is at least one house.

2. **Q: Can the values in `nums` be zero?**
   - A: Yes, each house can have zero money.

3. **Q: Are negative numbers allowed in the `nums` array?**
   - A: No, the problem statement ensures values in `nums` are non-negative.

4. **Q: Do we need to return anything specific if the `nums` array is empty?**
   - A: Since the problem constraints guarantee at least one element, this situation will not occur.

### Strategy

This problem can be tackled using dynamic programming. The idea is to maintain an array `dp` where each element `dp[i]` represents the maximum amount of money that can be robbed up to the i-th house. The state transitions are based on the choice of whether to rob the current house or not:

- If we rob the current house, we add its value to `dp[i-2]` (since we cannot rob the previous house).
- If we don't rob the current house, the value is just `dp[i-1]` (the maximum amount robbed up to the previous house).

The recurrence relation can be described as:

\[
dp[i] = \max(dp[i-1], nums[i] + dp[i-2])
\]

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var rob = function(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    if (n === 0) return 0;
    if (n === 1) return nums[0];
    
    // Array to store the maximum values
    let dp = new Array(n);
    
    // Initialization based on the initial houses
    dp[0] = nums[0];
    dp[1] = Math.max(nums[0], nums[1]);
    
    // Fill the dp array based on the recurrence relation
    for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
        dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i-1], nums[i] + dp[i-2]);
    }
    
    // The result will be in the last element of the dp array
    return dp[n-1];
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the nums array. This is because we are iterating through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), due to the additional space used by the dp array to store the maximum values up to each house.

Alternatively, we can optimize the space complexity to O(1) by not keeping the entire dp array, instead only keeping track of the last two computed values.

### Optimized Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var rob = function(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    if (n === 0) return 0;
    if (n === 1) return nums[0];
    
    let prev2 = nums[0];
    let prev1 = Math.max(nums[0], nums[1]);
    
    for (let i = 2; i < n; i++) {
        let current = Math.max(prev1, nums[i] + prev2);
        prev2 = prev1;
        prev1 = current;
    }
    
    return prev1;
};
```

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), same as before.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), due to only using two extra variables instead of the entire dp array.

This should efficiently solve the House Robber problem.
