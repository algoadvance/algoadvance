[Leetcode 2110. Number of Smooth Descent Periods of a Stock](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2110)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `prices` representing the daily price history of a stock, where `prices[i]` is the price of the stock on day `i`.

A smooth descent period is a period where the price decreases by exactly `1` per day. For example, if `prices = [3, 2, 1, 4]`, then `prices[0], prices[1], prices[2]` is a smooth descent period but `prices[2], prices[3]` is not.

Return the number of smooth descent periods.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the input array be empty?
   **A:** No, the input array will have at least one element based on the problem constraints.
   
2. **Q:** Are we considering single-element periods as smooth descent periods?
   **A:** Yes, single-element periods are considered as smooth descent periods as they trivially fulfill the condition.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will:
1. Iterate through the given `prices` array.
2. Keep count of continuous smooth descent periods in a variable.
3. For each element in the array, check if it is part of a smooth descent period by comparing it with the previous element.
4. Accumulate the counts of all possible smooth descent subarrays.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} prices
 * @return {number}
 */
var getDescentPeriods = function(prices) {
    let n = prices.length;
    let totalDescentPeriods = 0;
    let currentLength = 1; // Each single element is a smooth descent period

    // Iterate through the prices array
    for(let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if(prices[i] === prices[i - 1] - 1) {
            currentLength++;
        } else {
            totalDescentPeriods += (currentLength * (currentLength + 1)) / 2;
            currentLength = 1;
        }
    }

    // Adding the remaining streak's descent periods
    totalDescentPeriods += (currentLength * (currentLength + 1)) / 2;

    return totalDescentPeriods;
};
```

### Detailed Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   - `totalDescentPeriods`: This variable keeps track of the total number of smooth descent periods.
   - `currentLength`: This variable tracks the current length of continuous descent periods.

2. **Iteration:**
   - We start iterating from the second element. If `prices[i]` is exactly 1 less than `prices[i-1]`, it means the descent continues, so we increment `currentLength`.
   - If there is a break in the descent (i.e., `prices[i]` is not 1 less than `prices[i-1]`), we calculate the total number of smooth descent periods for the current streak using the formula `(currentLength * (currentLength + 1)) / 2`, add it to `totalDescentPeriods`, and reset `currentLength` to 1.

3. **Final Calculation:**
   - After the loop, we make sure to add the periods of the last streak that was tracked.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the `prices` array since we pass through the array only once.
- The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
