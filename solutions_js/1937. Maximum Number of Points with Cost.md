[Leetcode 1937. Maximum Number of Points with Cost](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1937)
### Problem Statement

The problem "1937. Maximum Number of Points with Cost" on LeetCode is as follows:

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `points` (0-indexed). 

Starting with any column in the first row, return the maximum number of points you can obtain by following these rules:

1. From the `i-th` row to the `i+1-th` row, you can move to column `j` in the next row, but it costs `|j - k|` points for you to move from column `k` of the current row to column `j` of the next row.
2. Specifically, from column `k` of row `i`, you can move to column `j` of row `i+1` and earn `points[i+1][j] - |j - k|` points.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a dynamic programming approach, updating the maximum points we can gain for each cell iteratively from the first row to the last row.

The general idea is:
1. Use a DP array to store the maximum points we can obtain for each cell up to the current row.
2. For each cell in the next row, calculate the maximum points we can obtain by moving from any cell in the current row to the next cell, considering the cost of the movement.
3. Use auxiliary arrays to optimize the calculation of the left and right maximum values that can be used to update the DP array for next row efficiently.

### Clarifying Questions
Let’s clarify a few things before we start coding:
1. Can the matrix `points` be empty or have any zero rows or columns?
2. Are there any constraints on the values inside the matrix to consider for edge cases?

If no additional constraints or edge cases need special handling, let’s proceed to the coding part.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} points
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxPoints = function(points) {
    const m = points.length;
    const n = points[0].length;

    // Create a dp array initialized with first row of points matrix
    let prevDp = points[0].slice();

    for (let i = 1; i < m; i++) {
        // Temporary arrays for left and right max values
        let leftMax = new Array(n).fill(0);
        let rightMax = new Array(n).fill(0);

        // Calculate leftMax
        leftMax[0] = prevDp[0];
        for (let j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            leftMax[j] = Math.max(leftMax[j - 1] - 1, prevDp[j]);
        }

        // Calculate rightMax
        rightMax[n - 1] = prevDp[n - 1];
        for (let j = n - 2; j >= 0; j--) {
            rightMax[j] = Math.max(rightMax[j + 1] - 1, prevDp[j]);
        }

        // Update dp for the current row
        let currDp = new Array(n).fill(0);
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            currDp[j] = points[i][j] + Math.max(leftMax[j], rightMax[j]);
        }

        prevDp = currDp;  // Move to the next row
    }

    // The answer is the maximum value in the last computed dp array
    return Math.max(...prevDp);
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: Setting up the initial DP array takes `O(n)`.
- **Processing Each Row**: 
  - Calculating `leftMax` and `rightMax` each takes `O(n)` time.
  - Updating `currDp` for the current row takes `O(n)` time.
  
  Therefore, processing each row takes `O(3n)` which simplifies to `O(n)`.

- **Total Time Complexity**:
  - Since we process each of the `m` rows, the total time complexity is `O(m * n)`.

This approach ensures that the time complexity is efficiently managed, making it suitable for large input sizes within typical competition constraints.
