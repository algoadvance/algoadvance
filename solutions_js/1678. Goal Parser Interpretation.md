[Leetcode 1678. Goal Parser Interpretation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1678)
## Problem Statement

You are asked to implement a Goal Parser that interprets a string command. The command consists of "G", "()" and/or "(al)" in some order. The Goal Parser will interpret these commands as follows:
- "G" -> "G"
- "()" -> "o"
- "(al)" -> "al"

Given the string `command`, return the Goal Parser's interpretation of the command.

### Example 1:
```
Input: command = "G()(al)"
Output: "Goal"
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: command = "G()()()()(al)"
Output: "Gooooal"
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: command = "(al)G(al)()()G"
Output: "alGalooG"
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= command.length <= 100`
- `command` consists of "G", "()", and/or "(al)" in some order.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume the given `command` string is always a valid sequence of "G", "()", and "(al)"?
2. Are there any invalid characters or malformed sequences we need to handle?

Assuming the command is always valid within given constraints.

## Strategy

The problem can be solved with straightforward string manipulation. Specifically, there are three types of substrings to recognize and replace:

1. "G" -> "G" (no change required)
2. "()" -> "o"
3. "(al)" -> "al"

The idea is to iterate through the string and build a new interpreted string by recognizing and replacing the patterns. 

We will use a pointer to iterate through the string:
1. If the current character is 'G', we simply append 'G' to the result.
2. If the current character is '(', we check the next characters to determine if it is "()" or "(al)". Based on the pattern, we append "o" or "al" to the result and adjust the pointer accordingly.

## Code

```javascript
function interpret(command) {
    let result = "";
    let i = 0;

    while (i < command.length) {
        if (command[i] === 'G') {
            result += 'G';
            i++;
        } else if (command[i] === '(' && command[i+1] === ')') {
            result += 'o';
            i += 2;
        } else if (command[i] === '(' && command[i+1] === 'a' && command[i+2] === 'l' && command[i+3] === ')') {
            result += 'al';
            i += 4;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the input string `command`. This is because we are iterating through the string once and performing constant time operations for each character or recognized pattern.
