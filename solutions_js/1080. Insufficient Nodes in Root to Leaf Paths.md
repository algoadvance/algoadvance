[Leetcode 1080. Insufficient Nodes in Root to Leaf Paths](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1080)
### Problem Statement

You are given the `root` of a binary tree and an integer `limit`. The tree is represented as a root node and each node contains an integer value. We define the sum of a path as the sum of the node values along that path. A leaf is a node with no children. 

Your task is to delete all insufficient nodes, where a node is insufficient if every root to leaf path traversing that node has a sum strictly less than `limit`.

Return the root of the tree after removing all insufficient nodes.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of node values and limit values?**
   Node values as well as the limit can be negative, zero, or positive.

2. **What should be returned if the root node itself is insufficient?**
   If the root node is insufficient, the function should return `null`.

3. **Can a node become a leaf after removal of all its children?**
   Yes, after removal of its children, a node can become a leaf.

### Strategy

1. **Recursive Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Use DFS to travel from the root to each leaf, accumulating the sum of the path `currentSum`.
   - When a leaf node is reached, check if the path sum is sufficient (i.e., greater than or equal to `limit`).
   - Recursively backtrack if a node itself along any path doesn't reach a sufficient sum, mark it for deletion.
   - If both children of a node are deleted, mark that node for deletion as well.
   
2. **Base Case**:
   - If a node is `null`, return `null`.

3. **Recursive Case**:
   - Traverse left and right children with the updated sum.
   - After recursive calls, check if the subtrees are `null` and decide whether to delete this node.

4. **Final Check**:
   - Determine if the current node should be deleted after processing its subtrees.

### Code
```javascript
class TreeNode {
    constructor(val, left=null, right=null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

function sufficientSubset(root, limit) {
    function dfs(node, currentSum) {
        if (node === null) return null;

        currentSum += node.val;

        if (node.left === null && node.right === null) {
            return currentSum >= limit ? node : null;
        }

        node.left = dfs(node.left, currentSum);
        node.right = dfs(node.right, currentSum);

        if (node.left === null && node.right === null) {
            return null;
        }

        return node;
    }

    return dfs(root, 0);
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time complexity**: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space complexity**: `O(h)` where `h` is the height of the tree. This is due to the recursion stack. In the worst case scenario (a completely unbalanced tree), this could be `O(n)`.

This should give us an efficient way to remove all insufficient nodes from the tree.
