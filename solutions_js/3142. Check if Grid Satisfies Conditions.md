[Leetcode 3142. Check if Grid Satisfies Conditions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3142)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `n x n` integer matrix grid. We define an hourglass as follows:

A subset of values with indices falling in this pattern in `grid`:

```
a b c
  d  
e f g
```

Return `true` if the grid contains at least one hourglass such that all four corners of the hourglass are equal. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of values for `n` (size of the grid)?
   - What are the possible values contained within the grid?

2. **Output Expected:**
   - Should the function return a boolean value (`true`/`false`) indicating if the condition is satisfied?

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} grid
 * @return {boolean}
 */
function checkHourglassConditions(grid) {
    const n = grid.length;

    // Check all possible hourglasses in the grid
    for (let i = 0; i <= n - 3; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j <= n - 3; j++) {
            // Get the hourglass corners
            const topLeft = grid[i][j];
            const topRight = grid[i][j + 2];
            const bottomLeft = grid[i + 2][j];
            const bottomRight = grid[i + 2][j + 2];

            // Check if all corners are equal
            if (topLeft === topRight && topRight === bottomLeft && bottomLeft === bottomRight) {
                return true;
            }
        }
    }

    // Default return false if no hourglass satisfies the condition
    return false;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Variables:** 
   - Get the size of the grid `n`.

2. **Loop through the grid:**
   - Use a nested loop to iterate over each possible top-left corner of an hourglass, ensuring that it doesn't go out of bounds.

3. **Check the Hourglass Corners:**
   - For each top-left corner, extract the value of the four corners of the hourglass.
   - Compare the four corner values to see if they are all equal.

4. **Result:**
   - Return `true` if any hourglass satisfies the condition.
   - If no valid hourglass is found after all checks, return `false`.

### Time Complexity

- **Nested Loop:** The nested loop runs `(n-2) * (n-2)` times to account for top-left corner positions within bounds of the grid.
- **Constant Time Checks Inside Loops:** Each nested iteration involves a constant time check of four elements.

Thus, the time complexity is **O(n^2)**.

This solution is efficient given that we are only iterating through potential hourglass positions and performing a few constant time operations within the nested loops.
