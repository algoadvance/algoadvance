[Leetcode 145. Binary Tree Postorder Traversal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l145)
## Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

In postorder traversal, the nodes are recursively visited in this order:
1. Left subtree
2. Right subtree
3. Node itself

Example:
```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [3,2,1]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: What should be the output if the given tree is empty?**
   - A: If the tree is empty, the output should be an empty list `[]`.
   
2. **Q: Can we use recursion to solve this problem?**
   - A: Yes, both recursive and iterative approaches can be used.

## Code

### Strategy
We can use two different approaches for solving this problem:
1. Recursive Approach
2. Iterative Approach

**Recursive Approach**:
- Define a helper function that performs postorder traversal.
- Start from the root and recursively traverse the left subtree, then the right subtree, and finally the root node.
- Collect the node values in a list and return it.

**Iterative Approach**:
- Use a stack to simulate the recursive postorder traversal.
- Push nodes onto the stack and manipulate the traversal order to ensure nodes are processed in postorder.

### Code

#### Recursive Approach
```javascript
function postorderTraversal(root) {
    const result = [];

    function traverse(node) {
        if (!node) return;
        traverse(node.left);
        traverse(node.right);
        result.push(node.val);
    }

    traverse(root);
    return result;
}
```

#### Iterative Approach
```javascript
function postorderTraversal(root) {
    if (!root) return [];

    const result = [];
    const stack = [root];
    const outputStack = [];

    while (stack.length) {
        const node = stack.pop();
        outputStack.push(node);

        if (node.left) {
            stack.push(node.left);
        }
        if (node.right) {
            stack.push(node.right);
        }
    }

    while (outputStack.length) {
        result.push(outputStack.pop().val);
    }

    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity
Both approaches have the same time complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of nodes in the tree because we visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case due to the recursion stack (in the recursive approach) or the use of the stack and output stack (in the iterative approach).
