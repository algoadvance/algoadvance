[Leetcode 893. Groups of Special](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l893)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings of the same length `words`. A string `S` is a special-equivalent string to `T` if after any number of moves, `S == T`.

A move consists of choosing two indices `i` and `j` with `i % 2 == j % 2`, and swapping `S[i]` with `S[j]`.

Return the number of groups of special-equivalent strings from the provided array `words`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format:** Will the input always be an array of strings? 
   - Yes.
2. **String Characteristics:** Are all the strings always of the same length?
   - Yes, as stated in the problem.
3. **String Content:** Can the strings contain special characters or numbers, or are they limited to lowercase letters?
   - They are limited to lowercase Latin letters, as typically assumed in such problems unless stated otherwise.

### Strategy

1. **Identify the Core Idea:**
   - A string can be transformed into another by swapping characters at indices with the same parity (either even or odd).
   - Therefore, the groups will be determined by the characters at even indices and the characters at odd indices, respectively.

2. **Normalization:**
   - For each string, separately sort the characters at even and odd indices.
   - Concatenate these sorted characters to create a "key" that represents the special-equivalent group.

3. **Count Groups:**
   - Use a set to track unique combinations of these "keys."

### Code

Here's how you can implement this in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @return {number}
 */
var numSpecialEquivGroups = function(words) {
    let uniqueGroups = new Set();

    words.forEach(word => {
        let evenChars = [];
        let oddChars = [];

        // Separate characters based on even and odd indices
        for (let i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
            if (i % 2 === 0) {
                evenChars.push(word[i]);
            } else {
                oddChars.push(word[i]);
            }
        }

        // Sort even and odd chars
        evenChars.sort();
        oddChars.sort();

        // Generate the unique key
        let uniqueKey = evenChars.join('') + oddChars.join('');
        uniqueGroups.add(uniqueKey);
    });

    return uniqueGroups.size;
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution involves a few steps:
1. **Splitting into Even and Odd Characters:** This takes O(n) for each word of length n.
2. **Sorting Characters:** Sorting is O(n log n).
3. **Combining and Storing Keys:** This is O(n).

So, for an array of length `k` with each string of size `n`, the overall time complexity is:
\[ O(k \cdot n \log n) \]

This approach ensures that even with a relatively larger input size, the problem remains computationally feasible.
