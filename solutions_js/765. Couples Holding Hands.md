[Leetcode 765. Couples Holding Hands](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l765)
### Problem Statement

You are given an even number of people `n` that stand in a row. Each person is numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. The people are arranged in a potential random manner, but there are couples among them. Couples holding hands means they are sitting next to each other. The people in a couple are represented by their numbers, `i` and `i + 1`. For example, `0` and `1` make a couple, `2` and `3` make another couple, and so on. Return the minimum number of swaps needed to arrange the row such that each couple is holding hands.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - `n` is an even number and `n >= 2`.
   - The input array is a permutation of integers from `0` to `n - 1`.

2. **Output:**
   - Return a single integer value representing the minimum number of swaps needed.

3. **Are there any special cases to consider?**
   - The input scenario where couples are already sitting together.
   - Worst-case scenario where no couples are sitting together initially.

### Strategy

The strategy involves the following steps:
1. Map each person to their position.
2. For each couple, ensure they are sitting together using a greedy approach.
3. For the first person in the current couple, if their pair is not right next to them, swap the necessary people to make them sit together.
4. Update the positions of the swapped individuals.
5. Repeat until all couples are holding hands.

### Code

```javascript
function minSwapsCouples(row) {
    // Create a map from person to their position in the row
    const position = new Map();
    for (let i = 0; i < row.length; i++) {
        position.set(row[i], i);
    }

    let swaps = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < row.length; i += 2) {
        let firstPerson = row[i];
        let couplePerson = firstPerson % 2 === 0 ? firstPerson + 1 : firstPerson - 1;

        if (row[i + 1] !== couplePerson) {
            swaps++;
            
            // Swap the out-of-place person with the person in the next position
            let currentPosition = i + 1;
            let couplePosition = position.get(couplePerson);

            // Swap the positions in the row
            [row[currentPosition], row[couplePosition]] = [row[couplePosition], row[currentPosition]];

            // Update the positions in the map
            position.set(row[currentPosition], currentPosition);
            position.set(row[couplePerson], couplePosition);
        }
    }

    return swaps;
}

// Example usage:
let row = [0, 2, 1, 3];
console.log(minSwapsCouples(row));  // Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity: O(n)**
  - We iterate through the row with a step of 2, thus making approximately `n/2` iterations.
  - Each swap involves O(1) operation due to the use of the map for quick look-up and update.
  
- **Space Complexity: O(n)**
  - We use a map to store the positions of each person in the row, which utilizes O(n) space.

This efficient approach ensures that the algorithm performs optimally even for large values of `n` while maintaining clarity and simplicity in the code.
