[Leetcode 2220. Minimum Bit Flips to Convert Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2220)
## Problem Statement

Given two integers `start` and `goal`, return the minimum number of bit flips required to convert `start` to `goal`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `start` and `goal` be negative?**
   - No, treat both integers as non-negative.

2. **What is the maximum value for `start` and `goal`?**
   - The values are within the 32-bit signed integer range, so `0 <= start, goal <= 2^31 - 1`.

3. **What do you mean by "bit flip"?**
   - A bit flip involves changing a bit from 0 to 1 or from 1 to 0.

## Strategy

1. Compute the XOR of `start` and `goal`. The result will have bits set to 1 wherever the corresponding bits of `start` and `goal` differ.
2. Count the number of 1s in the XOR result, as each 1-bit represents a position where a flip is required.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} start
 * @param {number} goal
 * @return {number}
 */
var minBitFlips = function(start, goal) {
    // Step 1: Perform XOR operation to find differing bits
    let xor = start ^ goal;
    
    // Step 2: Count the number of 1s in the XOR result
    let count = 0;
    while (xor > 0) {
        // If the least significant bit is 1, increment count
        if (xor & 1) {
            count++;
        }
        // Right shift xor by 1 to check the next bit
        xor >>= 1;
    }
    
    return count;
};

// Example Usage:
console.log(minBitFlips(10, 20));  // Output: 4
```

## Time Complexity

- **XOR Operation**: O(1) because it's a single bit-wise operation.
- **Counting 1s**: Worst-case time complexity is O(32) since we're dealing with 32-bit integers. In reality, this would be considered O(1) since the number of bits is constant.

As a result, the overall time complexity is **O(1)**.
