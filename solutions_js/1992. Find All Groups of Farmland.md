[Leetcode 1992. Find All Groups of Farmland](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1992)
Certainly! Let's break down the solution for LeetCode problem "1992. Find All Groups of Farmland" in JavaScript.

### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D array `land` where:
- `land[i][j] == 0` represents land `i, j` is NOT farmland.
- `land[i][j] == 1` represents land `i, j` IS farmland.

To find the upper-left and bottom-right corners of each group of farmland, return a list of non-overlapping rectangles `[r1, c1, r2, c2]` such that:
- `(r1, c1)` is the upper-left corner,
- `(r2, c2)` is the bottom-right corner of a rectangular farmland group.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Size and Constraints**:
   - What are the constraints on the size of the grid?
   - Is it possible to have multiple distinct farmland groups?

2. **Valid Shapes of Farmland**:
   - Are all groups of farmland indicated to be perfect rectangles without any gaps?
   
Assuming the grid size is within acceptable limits and the farmlands are grouped in rectangles without gaps, we proceed with the solution.

### Strategy

1. **Traversal**:
   - Traverse the grid and identify the start of a new farmland (cell with `1`).
   - Once a cell with `1` is identified, determine the extent (bottom-right corner) of this farmland.

2. **Marking Process**:
   - Mark the farmland as visited to avoid reprocessing.

3. **Store Results**:
   - Store the coordinates of the top-left and bottom-right corners.

### Code

Hereâ€™s the JavaScript implementation of the described strategy:

```javascript
function findFarmland(land) {
    const rows = land.length;
    const cols = land[0].length;
    
    const result = [];
    
    for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
        for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
            if (land[r][c] === 1) {
                // Farmland found: Determine the boundaries
                let r2 = r;
                let c2 = c;
                
                // Find the bottom-most row of the farmland
                while (r2 + 1 < rows && land[r2 + 1][c] === 1) {
                    r2++;
                }
                
                // Find the right-most column of the farmland
                while (c2 + 1 < cols && land[r][c2 + 1] === 1) {
                    c2++;
                }
                
                // Add the coordinates of the farmland to the result
                result.push([r, c, r2, c2]);
                
                // Mark the entire farmland as visited
                for (let i = r; i <= r2; i++) {
                    for (let j = c; j <= c2; j++) {
                        land[i][j] = 0;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- The overall time complexity is **O(m * n)** where **m** is the number of rows and **n** the number of columns. This is due to the need to traverse every cell of the grid exactly once.
- Space complexity is **O(1)**, not considering the space required to store the result. The grid is updated in place.

By carefully marking visited cells within nested loops as we explore farms, the algorithm efficiently processes the grid in linear time relative to its size.
