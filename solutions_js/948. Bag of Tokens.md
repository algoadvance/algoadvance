[Leetcode 948. Bag of Tokens](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l948)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `tokens` where `tokens[i]` is the value of the i-th token, and an integer `P` representing your initial power.

To play with a token, you can either:
1. Spend `P` power to gain 1 point (when the token is face up), or
2. Gain `P` power by exhausting 1 point (when the token is face down).

Each token can be played at most once and in any order. Your goal is to maximize the number of points you can have after playing any number of tokens.

Return the largest number of points you can achieve after playing any number of tokens.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can we assume the input `tokens` array and `P` will always be non-negative?
   - Yes, `tokens` will always contain non-negative integers, and `P` will always be a non-negative integer.

2. Is there any constraint on the size of the tokens array or the range of P?
   - We'll assume reasonable constraints such as `1 <= tokens.length <= 1000` and `0 <= tokens[i], P <= 10^4`.

### Strategy
1. **Sorting**: Start by sorting the tokens array. This will help us manage which token to play and when.
2. **Two-pointer approach**: Use two pointers methods to determine the best possible use of tokens. 
   - Use the smallest tokens for gaining points.
   - Use the largest tokens for gaining power if needed to possibly use more smaller tokens later.
3. **Simulation**: 
   - Use a greedy algorithm to maximize points by trying to flip the cheapest token face up first.
   - If out of power and have points, use the most expensive token to gain power by flipping it face down.

### Code
Hereâ€™s the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} tokens
 * @param {number} P
 * @return {number}
 */
var bagOfTokensScore = function(tokens, P) {
    tokens.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    let left = 0, right = tokens.length - 1;
    let points = 0, maxPoints = 0;

    while (left <= right) {
        if (P >= tokens[left]) {
            // Gain a point by spending power
            P -= tokens[left];
            points += 1;
            left += 1;
            // Update the maximum points
            maxPoints = Math.max(maxPoints, points);
        } else if (points > 0) {
            // Gain power by spending a point
            P += tokens[right];
            points -= 1;
            right -= 1;
        } else {
            // If neither condition is met, break the loop
            break;
        }
    }

    return maxPoints;
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of tokens.
- **Two-pointer traversal**: `O(n)`, as each token is considered at most once by both pointers.
- **Overall**: The overall complexity is dominated by the sorting step, hence `O(n log n)`.

This approach ensures that we effectively manage the playing of tokens to maximize the points gained.
