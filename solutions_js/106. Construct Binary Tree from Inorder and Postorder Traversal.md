[Leetcode 106. Construct Binary Tree from Inorder and Postorder Traversal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l106)
## Problem Statement
Given two integer arrays `inorder` and `postorder` where `inorder` is the inorder traversal of a binary tree and `postorder` is the postorder traversal of the same tree, construct and return the binary tree.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the lengths of the arrays?**
   - The lengths of `inorder` and `postorder` will always be the same and equal to the number of nodes in the tree.
   
2. **Can the tree contain duplicate values?**
   - No, the tree contains unique values as nodes.

3. **What should be returned if the arrays are empty?**
   - If the arrays are empty, return `null`.

## Strategy
1. **Understand the Traversals:**
   - `Inorder` traversal follows Left -> Root -> Right.
   - `Postorder` traversal follows Left -> Right -> Root.
   
2. **Approach:**
   - The last element in `postorder` is the root of the tree.
   - Find the index of this root in `inorder` to divide the tree into the left and right subtrees.
   - Recursively repeat the process for the left and right subtrees.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - Base Case: If either `inorder` or `postorder` is empty, return `null`.
   - Recursive Case: Identify root from `postorder`, locate it in `inorder` to determine left and right subtrees, then build subtrees recursively.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */
var buildTree = function(inorder, postorder) {
    if (inorder.length === 0 || postorder.length === 0) {
        return null;
    }
    
    // The last element of postorder is the root of the tree
    let rootVal = postorder.pop();
    let root = new TreeNode(rootVal);
    
    // Find the index of the root in inorder array
    let rootIndex = inorder.indexOf(rootVal);
    
    // Recursively build the right and left subtrees
    // Important: build right before left because we're consuming postorder from the end
    root.right = buildTree(inorder.slice(rootIndex + 1), postorder.slice(rootIndex));
    root.left = buildTree(inorder.slice(0, rootIndex), postorder.slice(0, rootIndex));
    
    return root;
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Each call to buildTree** involves slicing the inorder and postorder arrays. Slicing is O(k), where k is the length of the sliced section.
- **In the worst case**, each node results in a recursive call that processes half the elements. The recurrence relation T(n) = 2T(n/2) + O(n) results in a complexity of:
  - O(n log n).

However, if hash maps were used to keep the indices of the inorder elements, slicing could be avoided, resulting in a linear time complexity of O(n). In the provided implementation, without hash maps, it's closer to O(n^2) in the worst case.
