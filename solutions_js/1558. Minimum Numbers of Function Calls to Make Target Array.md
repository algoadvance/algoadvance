[Leetcode 1558. Minimum Numbers of Function Calls to Make Target Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1558)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `target`, you have an empty integer array `arr` and you need to perform the following operations to make `arr` equal to `target`:

1. Insert 1 at the end of the list.
2. Multiply all numbers in the array by 2.

You must use the minimum number of function calls to make the `arr` equal to the `target`. Return that minimum number of function calls.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the target array contain negative numbers or zeros?**
   - No, it is given that `target` contains only positive integers.

2. **Is the target array guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, the `target` array is guaranteed to be non-empty.

3. **What is the range of the numbers in the target array and its length?**
   - The exact range isn’t specified, so we will assume reasonable constraints.

### Strategy

1. **Operations Interpretation**: We need to track the number of operations:
   - "Insert 1" operation adds a 1. Every element in `target` requires at least one "Insert 1" operation to reach that value starting from 0.
   - "Multiply by 2" operation doubles the existing values in `arr`.

2. **Initial Thoughts**:
   - Fixing each element in `target` independently might give a clear picture.
   - Decompose each element to its binary representation. Each element’s value can be built by combining bits which are powers of 2.

3. **Detailed Steps**:
   1. For each element in `target`, break it down into its binary representation.
   2. Count the number of times you need to "Insert 1" — this is the number of 1s in the binary representation.
   3. Count the maximum number of "Multiply by 2" operations — this is the position of the highest set bit in the binary representation.

4. **Summarize**:
   - For "Insert 1" operation: Sum the counts of 1s for each element.
   - For "Multiply by 2" operation: Find the largest number of shifts needed among all elements.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} target
 * @return {number}
 */
var minOperations = function(target) {
    let insertOperations = 0;
    let maxMultiplyOperations = 0;
    
    for (const num of target) {
        let currentNum = num;
        let multiplyOperations = 0;

        while (currentNum > 0) {
            if (currentNum % 2 === 1) { // If current number is odd, add an "Insert 1"
                insertOperations++;
            }
            currentNum = Math.floor(currentNum / 2);
            if (currentNum > 0) {
                multiplyOperations++;
            }
        }
        
        maxMultiplyOperations = Math.max(maxMultiplyOperations, multiplyOperations);
    }
    
    return insertOperations + maxMultiplyOperations;
};

// Example usage
console.log(minOperations([1, 5])); // Should output 5
console.log(minOperations([2, 2])); // Should output 3
console.log(minOperations([4, 2, 40])); // Should output 9
```

### Time Complexity

- **Insert operations count** loop runs once per bit of each number in `target`, essentially O(log(max(target))).
- **Multiply operations becomes the maximum exponent of 2 for any number**.

Thus, the overall **time complexity is O(n * log(max(target)))**, where `n` is the number of elements in `target` and `max(target)` is the largest number in the `target` array.
