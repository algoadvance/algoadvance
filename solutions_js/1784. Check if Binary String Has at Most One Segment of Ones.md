[Leetcode 1784. Check if Binary String Has at Most One Segment of Ones](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1784)
### Problem Statement

Given a binary string `s`, you need to check if it contains at most one contiguous segment of ones. If the string does have at most one segment of ones, return `true`, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Is the input string non-empty?
   - What is the maximum length of the input string?
   
2. **Output:**
   - The output should be a boolean value: `true` if there is at most one contiguous segment of ones, and `false` otherwise.

Assuming binary string `s` is non-empty and can be of arbitrary length.

### Strategy

1. One simple and effective way to solve this problem is to traverse the string and check for transitions. Specifically, we're interested in counting the number of times we encounter the pattern `"10"`.
2. If we encounter `"10"` more than once, it signifies that there are multiple segments of ones.
3. Traverse the string until we find the first `1`, then check if we hit a `0` followed by another `1`. If yes, then return `false`.
4. Otherwise, return `true`.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var checkOnesSegment = function(s) {
    // We start by looking for our first "10" transition
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length - 1; i++) {
        if (s[i] === '1' && s[i + 1] === '0') {
            // We've found "10", now let's check if there's a "1" afterwards
            for (let j = i + 1; j < s.length; j++) {
                if (s[j] === '1') {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return true;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- The solution has a time complexity of **O(n)**, where **n** is the length of the binary string `s`. This is because:
  - We potentially traverse the string twice:
    1. First to find the initial segment of ones and the first `0`.
    2. Second to check for any '1's after encountering a '0'.

This strategy ensures that we can determine the answer efficiently by making a single linear pass with a potential continuation in a worst-case scenario.
