[Leetcode 525. Contiguous Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l525)
## Problem Statement
Given a binary array `nums`, return the maximum length of a contiguous subarray with an equal number of 0 and 1.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be returned exactly?**
   - The length of the longest contiguous subarray where the number of 0s is equal to the number of 1s.

2. **Is the input always valid and non-empty?**
   - Yes, you can assume the input is always a valid binary array.

3. **What is the range of the input array size?**
   - The size of the input array can range from 1 to 50,000.

4. **Are there any constraints on the values in the array?**
   - Yes, the values in the array are restricted to 0 and 1 only.

## Strategy
The problem can be approached using a single-pass algorithm with the help of a hash map to store the first occurrence of each cumulative sum. We'll convert 0s to -1s to make the sum approach easier:

1. Initialize a cumulative sum `sum` to 0.
2. Use a hash map `sumToIndex` to keep track of the first index where each cumulative sum occurs. Initialize it with `{0: -1}` to handle the case where the subarray starts from index 0.
3. Traverse the array:
   - Increment the sum by 1 if the element is 1 and decrement it by 1 if the element is 0.
   - If the current cumulative sum has been seen before (exists in `sumToIndex`), compute the length of the subarray from the previous index to the current index and update the maximum length.
   - If the current cumulative sum has not been seen before, add it to `sumToIndex` with the current index.

This approach works in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the array, and O(n) space complexity due to the hash map.

## Code
```javascript
function findMaxLength(nums) {
    let sumToIndex = {0: -1};  // Initialize with cumulative sum 0 occurring before the array starts
    let sum = 0;
    let maxLength = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        // Convert 0 to -1, keep 1 as it is
        sum += (nums[i] === 0 ? -1 : 1);

        if (sumToIndex.hasOwnProperty(sum)) {
            // If the cumulative sum has been seen before, calculate the length of the subarray
            let length = i - sumToIndex[sum];
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, length);
        } else {
            // Store the index of the first occurrence of this cumulative sum
            sumToIndex[sum] = i;
        }
    }
    
    return maxLength;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input array. We traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), in the worst case, we might store all unique cumulative sums in our hash map.
