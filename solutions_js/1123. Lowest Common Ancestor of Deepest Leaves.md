[Leetcode 1123. Lowest Common Ancestor of Deepest Leaves](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1123)
## Problem Statement

Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the lowest common ancestor of its deepest leaves.

For example, in the below binary tree:

```
        1
       / \
      2   3
     /   / \
    4   5   6
   /
  7
```

The deepest leaves are 7, 5, and 6. The lowest common ancestor of these leaves is the node with value 1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is considered a "deepest" leaf?**
   - A deepest leaf is a node that has the maximum depth in the tree.

2. **What is the definition of the Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)?**
   - The LCA of two nodes `p` and `q` in a binary tree is the lowest node that has both `p` and `q` as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).

3. **Can the tree be empty?**
   - Yes, if the provided tree is empty, we should return `null`.

4. **Do all leaves have to be at the same depth for them to be considered?**
   - Yes, we are only concerned with the deepest leaves.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we will perform the following steps:

1. **Find the Maximum Depth**:
   - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree to determine the maximum depth of any leaf node.

2. **Find the LCA of Deepest Leaves**:
   - Utilize another DFS traversal to find the LCA of all nodes that are at the maximum depth determined in the first step.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Determine the maximum depth**:
   - A helper function will traverse the tree and return the maximum depth encountered.

2. **Find LCA of deepest leaves**:
   - A recursive helper function will return the LCA of nodes if they are at the deepest level identified.

## Code

Here's the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var lcaDeepestLeaves = function(root) {
    if (!root) return null;

    // Helper function to determine the depth of a given node
    const getDepth = (node) => {
        if (!node) return 0;
        const leftDepth = getDepth(node.left);
        const rightDepth = getDepth(node.right);
        return Math.max(leftDepth, rightDepth) + 1;
    };

    // Helper function to find the LCA of deepest leaves
    const findLca = (node) => {
        if (!node) return [null, 0];

        const [leftLca, leftDepth] = findLca(node.left);
        const [rightLca, rightDepth] = findLca(node.right);
        
        if (leftDepth === rightDepth) {
            return [node, leftDepth + 1];
        }
        
        if (leftDepth > rightDepth) {
            return [leftLca, leftDepth + 1];
        } else {
            return [rightLca, rightDepth + 1];
        }
    };

    const [lca, _] = findLca(root);
    return lca;
};
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Determining the Maximum Depth**:
   - The depth calculation traverses each node once, resulting in `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree.

2. **Finding the LCA**:
   - The LCA calculation also traverses each node once, resulting in an additional `O(N)` complexity.

Hence, the total time complexity of the solution is `O(N)`. The space complexity is determined by the recursion stack, which in the worst case is `O(H)`, where `H` is the height of the tree.
