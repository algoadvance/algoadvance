[Leetcode 1901. Find a Peak Element II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1901)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `mat` where:

- `mat[i][j] < mat[i+1][j]` for all valid `i` (moving upwards in columns),
- `mat[i][j] < mat[i][j+1]` for all valid `j` (moving left to right in rows).

You need to find a peak element in this matrix. A peak element in a 2D matrix is an element that is greater than or equal to all of its 4 possible neighbors (the elements on the left, right, top, and bottom).

Find any peak element in the matrix and return its index as a list: `[row_index, col_index]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Is there a guarantee that the matrix will have at least one peak element?
   **A:** Yes, per the problem, such a matrix is guaranteed to have at least one peak element.
   
2. **Q:** Can the matrix have multiple peak elements?
   **A:** Yes, but any valid peak element can be returned.
   
3. **Q:** Are the borders of the matrix treated any differently when checking for peak elements?
   **A:** No, the borders should be treated the same, and the value comparisons should work for any element within matrix bounds.

4. **Q:** Can the peak element be on the boundary of the matrix?
   **A:** Yes, a peak element can be on the boundary.

### Code

```javascript
function findPeakGrid(mat) {
    let start = 0, end = mat[0].length - 1;

    while (start <= end) {
        let mid = Math.floor((start + end) / 2);

        // Find the maximum element in the middle column 'mid'
        let maxRow = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < mat.length; i++) {
            if (mat[i][mid] > mat[maxRow][mid]) {
                maxRow = i;
            }
        }

        // Compare with the element on the left and right of the maximum element (if it exists)
        let leftIsBigger = (mid - 1 >= 0) && (mat[maxRow][mid - 1] > mat[maxRow][mid]);
        let rightIsBigger = (mid + 1 < mat[0].length) && (mat[maxRow][mid + 1] > mat[maxRow][mid]);

        // If the middle element is greater than its neighbors, we found a peak
        if (!leftIsBigger && !rightIsBigger) {
            return [maxRow, mid];
        }

        // If the left neighbor is bigger, we need to search in the left half
        if (leftIsBigger) {
            end = mid - 1;
        } else { // Otherwise, the right neighbor must be larger, so search the right half
            start = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return []; // Just a fallback, should never reach here due to problem constraints
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Binary Search Approach on Columns:** 
    - Perform a binary search on the columns of the matrix.
    - For each middle column selected, find the row that has the maximum element.
    - Compare the maximum element in the middle column to its left and right neighbors to determine if it is a peak.
2. **Edge Conditions:** 
    - If the maximum element in the middle column is greater than or equal to its neighbors, it is a peak.
    - Otherwise, if the left neighbor is larger, search in the left half.
    - If the right neighbor is larger, search in the right half.
 
### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(m \log n)\), where \(m\) is the number of rows and \(n\) is the number of columns.
  - Finding the maximum element in a column takes \(O(m)\) time.
  - The binary search on columns takes \(O(\log n)\) iterations.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), as we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
