[Leetcode 2284. Sender With Largest Word Count](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2284)
### Problem Statement

You are given two string arrays `messages` and `senders`. The `messages[i]` is a message sent by the sender `senders[i]`.

A message is list of words that are separated by a single space with no leading or trailing spaces. The word count of a sender is the total number of words sent by the sender. Note that a sender may send more than one message.

Return the sender with the largest word count. If there is more than one sender with the largest word count, return the one with the lexicographically largest name.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Validity**: Can we assume that the length of `messages` and `senders` is the same?
   - Yes, you can assume that the length of `messages` and `senders` will always be the same.

2. **Empty input**: What should be the output if the `messages` and `senders` arrays are empty?
   - You can assume that the input will contain at least one message and sender.

3. **Word Definition**: How are words defined in the messages?
   - Words are separated by a single space, with no leading or trailing spaces.

4. **Character case**: Do we consider case sensitivity when comparing sender names lexicographically?
   - Yes, comparison should be case-sensitive.

### Strategy

1. Create a dictionary to count the number of words each sender has sent.
2. Iterate through each message, split it into words, and update the senderâ€™s word count in the dictionary.
3. After tallying all word counts, determine the sender with the highest word count. In case of a tie, choose the lexicographically larger sender name.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[]} messages
 * @param {string[]} senders
 * @return {string}
 */
function largestWordCount(messages, senders) {
    const wordCountMap = new Map();

    for (let i = 0; i < messages.length; i++) {
        const message = messages[i];
        const sender = senders[i];
        const wordCount = message.split(' ').length;

        if (wordCountMap.has(sender)) {
            wordCountMap.set(sender, wordCountMap.get(sender) + wordCount);
        } else {
            wordCountMap.set(sender, wordCount);
        }
    }

    let maxCount = 0;
    let maxSender = '';

    for (const [sender, count] of wordCountMap.entries()) {
        if (count > maxCount || (count === maxCount && sender > maxSender)) {
            maxCount = count;
            maxSender = sender;
        }
    }

    return maxSender;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N + M), where N is the number of messages and M is the total number of words in all messages. This comes from:
  - O(N) for iterating through all the messages.
  - O(M) for splitting all the messages into words.

- **Space Complexity**: O(K), where K is the number of unique senders. This comes from storing the word counts in the map.
