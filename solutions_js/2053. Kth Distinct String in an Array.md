[Leetcode 2053. Kth Distinct String in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2053)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `arr` and an integer `k`. A string `s` is called distinct if it appears exactly once in `arr`. Return the `k`-th distinct string in the array. If there are fewer than `k` distinct strings, return an empty string `""`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `arr` contain empty strings?**
   - Yes, `arr` can contain empty strings, but they are treated just like any other string.
   
2. **What will be the range of values for `k`?**
   - `k` is a positive integer and will be within the size of the array `arr`.

3. **What is the expected size of the array `arr`?**
   - There is no explicit size constraint, but typically it should be manageable within typical memory limits for an interview problem.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:

1. **Count the Occurrences:**
   - Use a hashmap to keep track of the frequency of each string in `arr`.
   
2. **Identify Distinct Strings:**
   - Iterate through the array again to collect strings that have a frequency of exactly one.

3. **Retrieve the k-th Distinct String:**
   - Return the k-th string from the list of distinct strings. If the list has fewer than `k` distinct strings, return an empty string.

### Time Complexity

- **Counting Occurrences:** O(n), where n is the length of `arr`.
- **Extracting Distinct Strings:** O(n), because we iterate through `arr` again.
- Overall time complexity is O(n).

### Code

Here's a solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function kthDistinct(arr, k) {
    // Step 1: Count the occurrences of each string
    const freqMap = new Map();
    for (const str of arr) {
        freqMap.set(str, (freqMap.get(str) || 0) + 1);
    }

    // Step 2: Collect the distinct strings
    const distinctStrings = [];
    for (const str of arr) {
        if (freqMap.get(str) === 1) {
            distinctStrings.push(str);
        }
    }

    // Step 3: Return the k-th distinct string or an empty string if not enough distinct strings
    return distinctStrings.length >= k ? distinctStrings[k - 1] : "";
}

// Example usage:
console.log(kthDistinct(["a", "b", "a", "c", "b", "d"], 2)); // Output: "d"
console.log(kthDistinct(["a", "abcd", "abc", "abcd"], 3)); // Output: ""
```

- **Step 1:** A hashmap (`Map`) is created to count the occurrences of each string in the array.
- **Step 2:** We populate a list of distinct strings that appear exactly once.
- **Step 3:** If there are at least `k` distinct strings, we return the k-th one. Otherwise, we return an empty string.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count and retrieve the k-th distinct string with a time complexity of O(n).
