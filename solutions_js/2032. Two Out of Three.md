[Leetcode 2032. Two Out of Three](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2032)
### Problem Statement

Given three arrays `nums1`, `nums2`, and `nums3`, return a list of values that are present in at least two out of the three arrays.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input:** What are the constraints on the sizes of the arrays? Are there any constraints on the elements of the arrays (e.g., positive integers only)?
   - **Constraints:**
     - `nums1.length, nums2.length, nums3.length` are in the range `[1, 100]`.
     - `1 <= nums1[i], nums2[i], nums3[i] <= 100`.
     - The elements in the arrays are integers between 1 and 100.
2. **Output:** Should the output be sorted, or can it be in any order?
   - The output can be in any order.

### Strategy

1. **Convert Arrays to Sets:** Use sets for each array to eliminate duplicates and facilitate quick lookup.
2. **Track Duplication:** Use a dictionary (or object) to count the occurrences of each element across the sets.
3. **Filter Results:** Collect elements that appear in at least two of the three sets.

### Pseudocode

1. Create sets for `nums1`, `nums2`, and `nums3`.
2. Initialize an empty object to keep count of the presence of each element in the sets.
3. Iterate through each set, and for each element in the set, increase its count in the dictionary.
4. Filter and return the elements that have a count of 2 or more.

### Code

```javascript
function twoOutOfThree(nums1, nums2, nums3) {
    // Convert arrays to sets to remove duplicates and for O(1) membership checks
    let set1 = new Set(nums1);
    let set2 = new Set(nums2);
    let set3 = new Set(nums3);

    // Dictionary to keep count of the presence of each number in the sets
    let count = {};

    // Helper function to increment count
    const incrementCount = (number) => {
        if (!(number in count)) {
            count[number] = 0;
        }
        count[number]++;
    };

    // Increment counts based on presence in the sets
    for (let num of set1) incrementCount(num);
    for (let num of set2) incrementCount(num);
    for (let num of set3) incrementCount(num);

    // Filter and collect the elements that appear in at least two sets
    let result = [];
    for (let num in count) {
        if (count[num] >= 2) {
            result.push(Number(num));
        }
    }

    return result;
}

// Example usage:
// nums1 = [1,1,3,2], nums2 = [2,3], nums3 = [3]
console.log(twoOutOfThree([1, 1, 3, 2], [2, 3], [3])); // Output: [2, 3]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Conversion to Sets:** O(n), where n is the length of the longest array (since inserting into a set is O(1)).
- **Counting Elements:** O(n) for each set, resulting in O(3n) which simplifies to O(n).
- **Filtering Results:** O(k), where k is the number of unique elements across all sets.

Overall, the solution runs in O(n) time complexity, where n is the length of the longest input array.
