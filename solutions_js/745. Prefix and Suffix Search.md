[Leetcode 745. Prefix and Suffix Search](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l745)
### Problem Statement

Design a special data structure that supports two operations: `f(prefix, suffix)`. Given the `prefix` and `suffix` of a word, return the index of the word in the list which has the given prefix and suffix. If there is more than one such word, return the index of the last one. If there is no such word, return -1.

Implement the `WordFilter` class:

- `WordFilter(string[] words)` Initializes the object with the words in the list.
- `int f(string prefix, string suffix)` Returns the index of the word in the list which has the given prefix and suffix. If there is more than one such word, return the index of the last one. If there is no such word, return -1.

### Example
```plaintext
Input
["WordFilter", "f"]
[[["apple", "banana", "cherry"]], ["a", "e"]]
Output
[null, 0]
Explanation
WordFilter wordFilter = new WordFilter(["apple", "banana", "cherry"]);
wordFilter.f("a", "e"); // returns 0 since the word at index 0 is "apple" which starts with "a" and ends with "e".
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the words in the list unique?
2. Can words contain special characters or will they strictly be alphabetic?
3. What is the maximum length of the `words` array?

### Strategy
1. **Initialization**:
    - During the initialization, we can generate a mapping of combined prefix and suffix to the word's index.
    - Iterate through each word, and for each combination of prefix and suffix of that word, map it to the index of that word.

2. **Query**:
    - When querying with a given prefix and suffix, directly retrieve the index from the precomputed dictionary.

### Code
```javascript
class WordFilter {
    constructor(words) {
        this.map = new Map();

        for (let w = 0; w < words.length; w++) {
            const word = words[w];
            const m = word.length;

            // Generate all prefix/suffix combinations
            for (let i = 0; i <= m; i++) {
                const prefix = word.substring(0, i);
                for (let j = 0; j <= m; j++) {
                    const suffix = word.substring(j);
                    this.map.set(`${prefix}#${suffix}`, w);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    f(prefix, suffix) {
        const key = `${prefix}#${suffix}`;
        return this.map.has(key) ? this.map.get(key) : -1;
    }
}

// Example usage
let wordFilter = new WordFilter(["apple", "banana", "cherry"]);
console.log(wordFilter.f("a", "e")); // returns 0
console.log(wordFilter.f("b", "a")); // returns 1
console.log(wordFilter.f("c", "y")); // returns 2
console.log(wordFilter.f("d", "y")); // returns -1 
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization**: O(N * L^3), where N is the number of words and L is the average length of the words. This is because for each word, we are generating combinations of all prefixes and suffixes and storing them in a map.
- **Query**: O(1). Each query just looks up a key in a map, which is a constant time operation.

This strategy ensures that while initialization may take some time, the queries are extremely fast, making it efficient if you have multiple queries to perform after setup.
