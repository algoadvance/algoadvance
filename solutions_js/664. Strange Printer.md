[Leetcode 664. Strange Printer](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l664)
### Problem Statement:

There is a strange printer with the following two special properties:

1. The printer can only print a sequence of the same character each time.
2. At each turn, the printer can print new characters starting from and ending at any place and will overwrite the existing characters.

Given a string `s`, return the minimum number of turns the printer needed to print it.

Example 1:
```
Input: s = "aaabbb"
Output: 2
Explanation: Print "aaa" first and then print "bbb".
```

Example 2:
```
Input: s = "aba"
Output: 2
Explanation: Print "aaa" first and then print "b" from the second place of "aaa".
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can the input string `s` contain any characters other than lowercase English letters?
  - No, the input string `s` will always consist of lowercase English letters only.
2. What is the maximum possible length of the string `s`?
  - The maximum length of the string `s` can be up to `100`.

### Strategy:
The problem can be reduced to finding the minimum number of segments we need to print distinctly. This suggests a dynamic programming solution where we build up the solution based on computing minimum prints for substrings of varying lengths:

1. Define a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum number of turns the printer needs to print the substring `s[i:j+1]`.
2. Initialize `dp[i][i]` to 1 because a single character always needs 1 turn to print.
3. For substrings of length greater than 1, iterate over all possible substrings of `s`, and for each substring `s[i:j]`, determine the minimum number of total prints required by dividing the substring into smaller parts.
4. Specifically, for each `dp[i][j]`, if `s[k]` equals `s[j]`, then `dp[i][j]` can be obtained by combining the results of `dp[i][k]` and `dp[k+1][j-1]`.

### Code:

```javascript
var strangePrinter = function(s) {
    const n = s.length;
    const dp = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(Infinity));
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        dp[i][i] = 1;  // A single character needs 1 turn to print
    }
    
    for (let length = 2; length <= n; length++) {
        for (let i = 0; i <= n - length; i++) {
            let j = i + length - 1;
            dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j] + 1;
            for (let k = i + 1; k <= j; k++) {
                if (s[k] === s[i]) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k - 1] + dp[k + 1][j]);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[0][n - 1];
};

// Example usage:
console.log(strangePrinter("aaabbb")); // Output: 2
console.log(strangePrinter("aba"));    // Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity:
1. **Initialization of the dp array:** This takes `O(n^2)` time.
2. **Main DP logic:** There are two nested loops which iterate through all substrings, plus an inner loop that for each `(i, j)` range scans from `i+1` to `j`. This also contributes `O(n^3)` time complexity.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n^3)`. This is acceptable given the constraint on the length of `s` being up to 100.
