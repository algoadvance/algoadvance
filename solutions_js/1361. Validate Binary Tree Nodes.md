[Leetcode 1361. Validate Binary Tree Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1361)
## Problem Statement

You are given `n` nodes, where each node is uniquely numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are also given two arrays `leftChild` and `rightChild` of length `n`, where `leftChild[i]` and `rightChild[i]` indicate that the `i-th` node has a left child and right child respectively. If `leftChild[i]` or `rightChild[i]` is `-1`, it means that there is no left or right child for the `i-th` node.

Write a function `validateBinaryTreeNodes` that returns `true` if the given arrays can represent the nodes of a binary tree, and returns `false` otherwise.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of `n`?** 
   - Typically in these problems, `n` will be within the constraints of standard integer arrays, so let's assume `1 <= n <= 10^4`.

2. **Are there any constraints on the values within `leftChild` and `rightChild`?**
   - Yes, values should be in the range of `[-1, n-1]`.

## Strategy
1. **Check for Unique Parent Nodes**:
   - Each node in a valid binary tree, except the root, must have exactly one parent. We can keep track of the number of parents for each node using an array `parentCount`.

2. **Find the Root**:
   - In a valid binary tree, there should be exactly one root node (a node with a parent count of 0). If there are zero or more than one root nodes, this should return false.

3. **Ensure Connectivity**:
   - Starting from the root, we should traverse all nodes to ensure that all `n` nodes are included, and there's no cycle.
   - We will use a DFS (Depth First Search) or BFS (Breadth First Search) to traverse and count reachable nodes from the root.


## Code
```javascript
function validateBinaryTreeNodes(n, leftChild, rightChild) {
    let parentCount = Array(n).fill(0);
    
    // Track the parent count for each node
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (leftChild[i] !== -1) {
            parentCount[leftChild[i]]++;
            if (parentCount[leftChild[i]] > 1) return false;
        }
        if (rightChild[i] !== -1) {
            parentCount[rightChild[i]]++;
            if (parentCount[rightChild[i]] > 1) return false;
        }
    }
    
    // Find the root (node with parent count 0)
    let rootCount = 0;
    let root = -1;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (parentCount[i] === 0) {
            rootCount++;
            root = i;
        }
    }
    
    if (rootCount !== 1) return false;
    
    // Ensure all nodes are reachable from the root using BFS or DFS
    let visitedCount = 0;
    let queue = [root];
    let visited = Array(n).fill(false);
    visited[root] = true;
    
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        let node = queue.shift();
        visitedCount++;
        
        if (leftChild[node] !== -1 && !visited[leftChild[node]]) {
            visited[leftChild[node]] = true;
            queue.push(leftChild[node]);
        }
        
        if (rightChild[node] !== -1 && !visited[rightChild[node]]) {
            visited[rightChild[node]] = true;
            queue.push(rightChild[node]);
        }
    }
    
    return visitedCount === n;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
    - Iterating through `leftChild` and `rightChild` arrays takes O(n).
    - BFS/DFS traversal takes O(n) in the worst case to visit each node once.
    
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
    - We use arrays for `parentCount` and `visited`, and a queue for BFS traversal, all of which take O(n) space.

This solution ensures that we check for a unique root, valid parenting, and full connectivity and acyclicity of the graph, thereby validating the binary tree structure.
