[Leetcode 3187. Peaks in Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3187)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D array `grid` with `m` rows and `n` columns which represents a height map where `grid[i][j]` represents the elevation at position `(i, j)`. A cell is considered a "peak" if it is greater than or equal to all of its 8 neighboring cells. Cells on the edge or corner of the grid are compared to their available neighbors.

Return a list of coordinates of all the peaks in `(row, column)` format.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be the format of the output set of coordinates?**
   - The format should be a list of tuples, e.g., `[(r1, c1), (r2, c2), ...]`.

2. **Can the grid contain negative numbers or non-integer values?**
   - For the purpose of this problem, assume all heights are integers. 

3. **What constitutes a peak if some of the neighboring cells are missing (e.g., at the edges)?**
   - Only the valid neighboring cells are considered. 

4. **Should the result list be sorted in any specific order?**
   - No specific order is required.

### Code

Here’s a possible solution in JavaScript to find and return the list of peaks coordinates in the given grid:

```javascript
function findPeaks(grid) {
    // Get the dimensions of the grid
    const rows = grid.length;
    const cols = grid[0].length;
    const peaks = [];

    // Directions representing 8 neighboring cells (top-left, top, top-right, right, bottom-right, bottom, bottom-left, left)
    const directions = [
        [-1, -1], [-1, 0], [-1, 1], 
        [0, 1], [1, 1], [1, 0], 
        [1, -1], [0, -1]
    ];
    
    // Function to check if a given position is within the grid bounds
    const isWithinBounds = (row, col) => row >= 0 && row < rows && col >= 0 && col < cols;
    
    // Iterate through each cell in the grid
    for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
        for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
            let isPeak = true;
            const currentHeight = grid[r][c];
            
            // Check all 8 directions
            for (let [dr, dc] of directions) {
                const newRow = r + dr;
                const newCol = c + dc;
                if (isWithinBounds(newRow, newCol) && grid[newRow][newCol] > currentHeight) {
                    isPeak = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (isPeak) {
                peaks.push([r, c]);
            }
        }
    }
    return peaks;
}

// Example usage
const grid = [
    [1, 2, 1],
    [3, 4, 5],
    [3, 3, 3]
];
console.log(findPeaks(grid));
// Output: [[1, 2], [2, 0], [2, 1], [2, 2]]
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Retrieve the number of rows and columns from the grid.
   - Define the possible directions to check the 8 neighboring cells.
   
2. **Boundary Check Function**:
   - Create a helper function to check if the given cell coordinate is within grid bounds.
   
3. **Iteration**:
   - Loop over each cell `(r, c)` in the grid.
   - Assume the current cell is a peak initially.
   
4. **Neighborhood Check**:
   - For each neighboring direction, calculate the neighboring cell’s coordinates.
   - Verify if the neighboring cell’s height is greater than the current cell’s height.
   - If any neighboring cell’s height is greater, mark the current cell as not a peak and break out of the loop.
   
5. **Collecting Peaks**:
   - If the cell remains marked as a peak after checking all valid neighbors, add its coordinates to the result list.
   
6. **Return the Result**:
   - Return the list of identified peak coordinates.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(m * n * 8)` where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid since each cell is checked against its 8 neighbors. Simplifies to `O(m * n)`.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` excluding the space needed for the output list of peaks.

This results in an efficient solution that systematically checks each cell and its neighbors for the peak condition.
