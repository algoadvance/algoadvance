[Leetcode 856. Score of Parentheses](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l856)
### Problem Statement
Given a balanced parentheses string `S`, compute the score of the string based on the following rules:
1. `()` has score 1.
2. `AB` has score `A + B`, where `A` and `B` are balanced parentheses strings.
3. `(A)` has score `2 * A`, where `A` is a balanced parentheses string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format:** Can I assume the input string only contains characters `(` and `)` and is always balanced?
   - Yes, the input string will be a balanced parentheses string of at most length 50.

2. **Output Format:** Should the result be an integer score?
   - Yes, the function should return an integer score.

### Strategy
We can solve this problem using a stack data structure. Here's the breakdown of the approach:

1. **Initialization:** Use a stack to keep track of scores at different levels of nested parentheses.
2. **Traversal:** Traverse the string character by character:
   - If the character is '(', push a zero onto the stack (representing the start of a new score level).
   - If the character is ')', process the stack to calculate the score for the most recent balanced parentheses:
     - Pop the top value from the stack. If it's zero, it represents an empty pair `()`, so push 1 back onto the stack.
     - If it's not zero, sum all values until a zero is encountered, multiply this sum by 2 (representing the score of `(A)`), and push back onto the stack.
3. **Result Extraction:** Sum all values remaining in the stack to get the final score.

### Code
Here's how you can implement this in JavaScript:

```javascript
function scoreOfParentheses(S) {
    let stack = [];
    
    for (let char of S) {
        if (char === '(') {
            stack.push(0);
        } else {
            let currentScore = 0;
            while (stack[stack.length - 1] !== 0) {
                currentScore += stack.pop();
            }
            stack.pop(); // Remove the zero
            stack.push(Math.max(2 * currentScore, 1));
        }
    }
    
    let totalScore = 0;
    while (stack.length > 0) {
        totalScore += stack.pop();
    }
    
    return totalScore;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(scoreOfParentheses("()"));      // Output: 1
console.log(scoreOfParentheses("(())"));    // Output: 2
console.log(scoreOfParentheses("()()"));    // Output: 2
console.log(scoreOfParentheses("(()(()))")); // Output: 6
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input string `S`, because we traverse the string once and perform constant-time operations for each character.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\) in the worst case due to the stack potentially holding up to \(n / 2\) elements for deeply nested parentheses.

This approach is efficient and leverages the stack data structure to handle the nested parentheses scores effectively.
