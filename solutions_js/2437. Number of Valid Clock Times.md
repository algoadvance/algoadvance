[Leetcode 2437. Number of Valid Clock Times](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2437)
### Problem Statement:

Given a string of length 5 representing a time in the format "HH:MM", where `HH` is a two-digit hour (00 to 23) and `MM` is a two-digit minute (00 to 59). Some digits of the string can be replaced with '?', which can be any digit from 0 to 9. The goal is to determine how many unique valid times can be generated by replacing the '?' characters.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Can the input string be completely filled with '?' characters?**
   - Yes, any of the characters could be '?'.

2. **Are there constraints on the characters aside from '?' or valid digits?**
   - No, the characters will either be digits or '?'. The string is always valid in length and format (e.g., "05:?0" or "1?:??").

3. **Is the ':' character always fixed in the third position of the string?**
   - Yes, the format will always be "HH:MM".

### Strategy:

1. **Identify the Possible Range for Each '?'**:
    - Determine the valid range for each character based on its position:
      - `H1` (first character of the hour) can be [0-2].
      - `H2` (second character of the hour) depends on `H1`:
        - If `H1` is 2, `H2` can be [0-3].
        - If `H1` is not 2 (i.e., 0 or 1), `H2` can be [0-9].
      - `M1` (first character of the minute) can be [0-5].
      - `M2` (second character of the minute) can be [0-9].

2. **Count Valid Permutations**:
    - For each character position, calculate how many valid digits can replace '?'.
    - Multiply the possible values for each '?' to get the total number of valid times.

### Code:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} time
 * @return {number}
 */
var countTime = function(time) {
    let possibleHours = 0, possibleMinutes = 0;
    
    // Calculate possible hour combinations
    let H1 = time[0], H2 = time[1];
    if (H1 === '?' && H2 === '?') {
        possibleHours = 24; // "00" to "23"
    } else if (H1 === '?') {
        possibleHours = (H2 <= '3') ? 3 : 2; // Depending on H2 (can be 0-3 if <=3) or (0-1 if >3)
    } else if (H2 === '?') {
        possibleHours = (H1 === '2') ? 4 : 10; // If H1 is 2, H2 can be 0-3, otherwise 0-9
    } else {
        possibleHours = 1; // Fixed time
    }
    
    // Calculate possible minute combinations
    let M1 = time[3], M2 = time[4];
    if (M1 === '?' && M2 === '?') {
        possibleMinutes = 60; // "00" to "59"
    } else if (M1 === '?') {
        possibleMinutes = 6; // "0" to "5"
    } else if (M2 === '?') {
        possibleMinutes = 10; // "0" to "9"
    } else {
        possibleMinutes = 1; // Fixed time
    }

    return possibleHours * possibleMinutes;
};
```

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this solution is O(1) since the operations involve fixed-time conditions and multiplications independent of input size. The result is computed by determining the valid hours and minutes configurations, which are constant-time operations.
