[Leetcode 1472. Design Browser History](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1472)
## Problem Statement

You have a browser history feature that needs to be implemented. You need to design a `BrowserHistory` class that supports the following functionalities:

1. `BrowserHistory(string homepage)`: Initializes the object with the homepage of the browser.
2. `void visit(string url)`: Increments the current page index forward by one, then removes all pages forward if they exist, and adds the new URL to the history.
3. `string back(int steps)`: Move steps back in history. Return the current URL after moving back in history at most steps.
4. `string forward(int steps)`: Move steps forward in history. Return the current URL after moving forward in history at most steps.

### Example:
```text
Input:
["BrowserHistory","visit","visit","visit","back","back","forward","visit","forward","back","back"]
[["leetcode.com"],["google.com"],["facebook.com"],["youtube.com"],[1],[1],[1],["linkedin.com"],[2],[2],[7]]
Output:
[null,null,null,null,"facebook.com","google.com","facebook.com",null,"linkedin.com","google.com","leetcode.com"]

Explanation:
BrowserHistory browserHistory = new BrowserHistory("leetcode.com");
browserHistory.visit("google.com");       // You are in "leetcode.com". Visit "google.com"
browserHistory.visit("facebook.com");     // You are in "google.com". Visit "facebook.com"
browserHistory.visit("youtube.com");      // You are in "facebook.com". Visit "youtube.com"
browserHistory.back(1);                   // You are in "youtube.com", move back to "facebook.com" return "facebook.com"
browserHistory.back(1);                   // You are in "facebook.com", move back to "google.com" return "google.com"
browserHistory.forward(1);                // You are in "google.com", move forward to "facebook.com" return "facebook.com"
browserHistory.visit("linkedin.com");     // You are in "facebook.com". Visit "linkedin.com"
browserHistory.forward(2);                // You are in "linkedin.com", you cannot move forward any steps return "linkedin.com"
browserHistory.back(2);                   // You are in "linkedin.com", move back two steps to "google.com" return "google.com"
browserHistory.back(7);                   // You are in "google.com", you can move back only one step to "leetcode.com" return "leetcode.com"
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the URLs unique in the history? 
2. Can the browser history have any specific upper limit on the number of URLs stored?
3. Do special characters in URLs need special handling, or can we assume URLs are valid strings?
4. Should we consider thread safety for concurrent access?

Answers:
1. Yes, URLs are unique in the given context.
2. No explicit upper limit on history size is provided.
3. We can assume URLs are valid strings.
4. No need to handle thread safety in this problem.

## Strategy

1. Use a list to keep track of the browser history.
2. Maintain an index pointer to the current position in the history list.
3. When a new URL is visited, truncate any forward history from the current index and append the new URL.
4. For back operations, move the index pointer back by the specified steps, ensuring it does not go out of bounds.
5. For forward operations, move the index pointer forward by the specified steps, ensuring it does not exceed the bounds of the history.

## Code

```javascript
class BrowserHistory {
    constructor(homepage) {
        this.history = [homepage];
        this.currentIndex = 0;
    }
    
    visit(url) {
        // Discard all forward history from the current index
        this.history = this.history.slice(0, this.currentIndex + 1);
        // Add the new URL
        this.history.push(url);
        // Move the pointer to the new end of the list
        this.currentIndex++;
    }
    
    back(steps) {
        // Move back, but ensure not to go out of bounds
        this.currentIndex = Math.max(this.currentIndex - steps, 0);
        return this.history[this.currentIndex];
    }
    
    forward(steps) {
        // Move forward, but ensure not to go out of bounds
        this.currentIndex = Math.min(this.currentIndex + steps, this.history.length - 1);
        return this.history[this.currentIndex];
    }
}

// Example usage:
// const browserHistory = new BrowserHistory("leetcode.com");
// browserHistory.visit("google.com");
// browserHistory.visit("facebook.com");
// console.log(browserHistory.back(1)); // "facebook.com"
// console.log(browserHistory.forward(1)); // "facebook.com"
// browserHistory.visit("linkedin.com");
// console.log(browserHistory.forward(2)); // "linkedin.com"
// console.log(browserHistory.back(2)); // "google.com"
// console.log(browserHistory.back(7)); // "leetcode.com"
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Initialization**: O(1) - setting up initial values.
2. **Visit**: O(n) - the slice operation can take up to O(n) in the worst case where n is the length of the current history.
3. **Back**: O(1) - just updating an index and checking boundaries.
4. **Forward**: O(1) - similarly, this only updates an index and checks boundaries.
