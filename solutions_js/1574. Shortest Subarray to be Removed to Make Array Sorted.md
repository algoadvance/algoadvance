[Leetcode 1574. Shortest Subarray to be Removed to Make Array Sorted](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1574)
## Problem Statement

- **Name**: 1574. Shortest Subarray to be Removed to Make Array Sorted-out
- **Description**: 
   Given an array of integers `arr`, you need to remove a subarray (can be empty) so that the remaining elements are sorted in non-decreasing order. 
   You should return the length of the shortest subarray to remove.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input constraints**:
   - What is the size range for `arr`?
   - What are the possible values for the integers in `arr`?

2. **Edge cases**:
   - How should we handle already sorted arrays?
   - What if the array has all identical elements?

3. **Output**:
   - Should we always return an integer?
   - What should we return if `arr` is already non-decreasing?

## Strategy

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - If the array is already sorted in non-decreasing order, the shortest subarray to remove is 0.
   - We need to identify boundaries where the array is already sorted and find sections that are not.

2. **Approach**:
   - Use two pointers technique to find the longest prefix and suffix which are sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - Try to remove any middle subarray between this prefix and suffix and calculate the minimum length to remove.
   
3. **Steps**:
   - Identify the longest non-decreasing prefix.
   - Identify the longest non-decreasing suffix.
   - For any valid breaking points between these sorted prefix and suffix, compute the possible lengths of the subarray to be removed.
   - Return the minimum length of all possible removal lengths.

## Code

```javascript
function findLengthOfShortestSubarray(arr) {
    let n = arr.length;
    let left = 0, right = n - 1;

    // Find longest non-decreasing prefix
    while (left < n - 1 && arr[left] <= arr[left + 1]) {
        left++;
    }

    // If the entire array is non-decreasing sorted
    if (left === n - 1) {
        return 0;
    }

    // Find longest non-decreasing suffix
    while (right > 0 && arr[right] >= arr[right - 1]) {
        right--;
    }

    // Minimum subarray to remove if removing either left or right section completely
    let minRemoveLength = Math.min(n - left - 1, right);

    // Try to find a valid middle section removal
    for (let i = 0; i <= left; i++) {
        // arr[left] is sorted, so we need to find the boundary in the suffix section
        while (right < n && arr[i] > arr[right]) {
            right++;
        }
        if (right < n) {
            minRemoveLength = Math.min(minRemoveLength, right - i - 1);
        }
    }

    return minRemoveLength;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - Finding the longest non-decreasing prefix and suffix takes O(n).
  - The iteration over possible splits and updating the minimum also takes O(n).

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Since weâ€™re using a constant amount of extra space for our pointers, the space complexity is O(1).
