[Leetcode 1371. Find the Longest Substring Containing Vowels in Even Counts](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1371)
## Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, return the length of the longest substring that contains each vowel (`'a'`, `'e'`, `'i'`, `'o'`, `'u'`) an even number of times.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "eleetminicoworoep"
Output: 13
Explanation: The longest substring is "leetminicowor" which contains vowels 'e', 'i', 'o' each an even number of times.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "leetcodeisgreat"
Output: 5
Explanation: The longest substring is "leetc" which contains vowels 'e' an even number of times.
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 5 * 10^5`
- `s` contains only lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What should be considered a vowel for this problem?
   - The vowels are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'.

2. Is the string guaranteed to consist of only lowercase letters?
   - Yes, `s` only contains lowercase English letters.

3. Are there any special characters or empty strings we need to handle?
   - There are no special characters and the string is guaranteed to have at least 1 character.

## Strategy
1. We will use a bitmask to track the parity (even or odd count) of each vowel.
2. We will maintain a `stateMask` where each bit represents whether the count of a vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u') is odd (1) or even (0).
3. We will use a hashmap to store the first occurrence of each `stateMask`.
4. As we iterate through the string, we will update the `stateMask` for each character. If the current `stateMask` has already been seen, it means the substring between the first occurrence of this mask and the current position has an even count for all vowels.
5. We will keep track of the maximum length of such substrings.

## Code
```javascript
var findTheLongestSubstring = function(s) {
    // Mapping vowels to specific bits
    const vowelMap = {'a': 1, 'e': 2, 'i': 4, 'o': 8, 'u': 16};
    let maxLength = 0;
    let stateMask = 0; // Bitmask to record parity of vowels
    const stateMap = new Map();
    stateMap.set(0, -1); // Base case: state 0 at position -1

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (vowelMap.hasOwnProperty(s[i])) {
            stateMask ^= vowelMap[s[i]]; // Toggle the corresponding bit
        }
        if (stateMap.has(stateMask)) {
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, i - stateMap.get(stateMask));
        } else {
            stateMap.set(stateMask, i);
        }
    }
    
    return maxLength;
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the string. We traverse the string once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since the possible number of different states for the bitmask is constant (2^5 = 32 states). The hashmap at most will store 32 entries.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the longest substring with vowels in even counts in linear time.
