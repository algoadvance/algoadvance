[Leetcode 2570. Merge Two 2D Arrays by Summing Values](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2570)
## Problem Statement
You are given two 2D integer arrays `arr1` and `arr2`.

- `arr1[i]` = [id_i, val_i] indicates that the number with id `id_i` has a value equal to `val_i`.
- `arr2[i]` = [id_i, val_i] indicates that the number with id `id_i` has a value equal to `val_i`.

Each array contains unique ids and is sorted in ascending order by id.

Merge `arr1` and `arr2` into a new 2D array `result` such that:

- `result[i]` = [id_i, sum_i], where `sum_i` is the sum of the values for the id `id_i` in `arr1` and `arr2`. If an id is found in only one of the two arrays, then that id's value in the `result` array will be the same as in the corresponding array.

Return the resulting array `result` sorted in ascending order by id.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Will there always be at least one element in arr1 or arr2?**
   - Yes, one or both arrays will always have elements.
  
2. **Can ids be negative or non-integer values?**
   - No, ids are always positive integers.

3. **Is there an upper limit on the number of elements in arr1 or arr2?**
   - Constraints on the size of arr1 and arr2 will be within the limits of a typical problem stated in LeetCode.

4. **Can the values (val_i) be negative?**
   - Yes, the values associated with ids can be negative.

## Strategy
1. Initialize an empty Map to store each id and its summed values.
2. Iterate through each array (`arr1` and `arr2`), adding their ids and values to the Map. If an id already exists in the Map, sum the values.
3. Convert the Map back into a 2D array, and sort it by id in ascending order.
4. Return the sorted 2D array.

## Code
```javascript
function mergeArrays(arr1, arr2) {
    const map = new Map();

    for (const [id, value] of arr1) {
        if (map.has(id)) {
            map.set(id, map.get(id) + value);
        } else {
            map.set(id, value);
        }
    }

    for (const [id, value] of arr2) {
        if (map.has(id)) {
            map.set(id, map.get(id) + value);
        } else {
            map.set(id, value);
        }
    }

    const result = [];
    for (const [id, value] of map) {
        result.push([id, value]);
    }

    result.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(m + n), where `m` is the length of `arr1` and `n` is the length of `arr2`. We iterate through both arrays once to populate the map.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m + n), as we're using a map to store each id and its corresponding summed values.

This approach efficiently merges and sums the values of the two arrays by leveraging the properties of maps for fast look-up and insertion, ensuring that our solution is both time and space optimal for the given constraints.
