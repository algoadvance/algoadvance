[Leetcode 2183. Count Array Pairs Divisible by K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2183)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Return the number of pairs `(i, j)` such that:
- `0 <= i < j <= nums.length - 1`
- `nums[i] * nums[j]` is divisible by `k`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size range of the array `nums`?**
   - This will help us understand the possible optimization strategies we may need.

2. **Can `nums` contain negative numbers?**
   - Knowing this will affect how we handle divisions and modular arithmetic.

3. **Is the array guaranteed to have at least 2 elements?**
   - This will help us avoid edge case errors.

### Assumptions Based on Problem Statement

- The array `nums` can be of any length, assumed from typical constraints.
- The values in `nums` are non-negative integers (though the problem does not specify this directly, we can assume it for practical coding purposes).
- The array has at least 2 elements because the problem asks for pairs.

### Strategy

To count pairs `(i, j)` such that the product `nums[i] * nums[j]` is divisible by `k`:
1. **Use a frequency map to store counts of numbers modulo `k`**:
   - For each number in `nums`, calculate its remainder when divided by `k`.
   - Use this remainder to increment count in a dictionary that keeps track of these remainders.
   
2. **Iterate through the array to count the valid pairs**:
   - For each element in `nums`, calculate its remainder when divided by `k`.
   - Check if there are elements in the remainder map that form a product with the current number that is divisible by `k`. 
   - Use mathematical properties of modular arithmetic to check divisibility conditions.

### Implementation

```javascript
function countPairs(nums, k) {
    let count = 0;
    const remainderMap = new Map();

    // Populate the remainder map
    for (const num of nums) {
        const remainder = num % k;
        if (remainderMap.has(remainder)) {
            remainderMap.set(remainder, remainderMap.get(remainder) + 1);
        } else {
            remainderMap.set(remainder, 1);
        }
    }

    // Count valid pairs
    for (const num of nums) {
        const remainder = num % k;
        remainderMap.set(remainder, remainderMap.get(remainder) - 1); // Decrease the count for current num

        // Check for pairs using remainder
        for (const [key, value] of remainderMap.entries()) {
            if (value > 0 && (remainder * key) % k === 0) {
                count += value;
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
}

// Example Usage:
let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let k = 2;
console.log(countPairs(nums, k)); // Output will depend on the example; this is just an example call.
```

### Time Complexity

- **Building the remainder map:** O(n), where `n` is the length of `nums`.
- **Iterating to count pairs:** O(n * m), where `m` is the number of distinct remainders (which can be at most `k`).

In the worst case, the time complexity could be O(n * k), which is acceptable for reasonable values of `n` and `k`.

### Space Complexity

- Additional space for storing the remainder map: O(k), where `k` is a constant relative to the remainder values.

This strategy effectively leverages modular arithmetic and a frequency map to keep the solution efficient and clear.
