[Leetcode 117. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l117)
## Problem Statement

You are given a binary tree where each node contains an extra pointer, `next`, which initially points to `null`. 

- You need to populate each `next` pointer to point to its next right node.
- If there is no next right node, the `next` pointer should be set to `null`.
- You must use only constant extra space.

Given the tree's definition:

```python
class Node {
    int val;
    Node left;
    Node right;
    Node next;
}
```

Modify the `next` pointers of each node in such a way that for each node in the tree, `node.next` points to its next right node.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can the tree be empty?
   - **A**: Yes, the tree can be empty.

2. **Q**: Do the nodes have unique values?
   - **A**: The uniqueness of node values doesn't impact the solution; hence, you can assume values may or may not be unique.

3. **Q**: Are all nodes having the `next` attribute initially set to `null`?
   - **A**: Yes, all `next` pointers are initially `null`.

4. **Q**: Do we have access to the root of this tree?
   - **A**: Yes, the root of the tree is provided.

## Strategy

We can use a level order traversal (traversal by each level from left to right) but since we must use constant extra space, we cannot use additional data structures like queues directly. Instead, we'll use the `next` pointers themselves to traverse the tree level-by-level, utilizing them as a sort of "linked list" to connect to the next level.

The general steps are:
1. Start from the root.
2. For each level, use a dummy node to handle the formation of the next level's linked list.
3. For each node at the current level, connect its children to the next level.
4. Move to the next level using the links we've created.

## Code

Here's the code to achieve this:

```javascript
class Node {
    constructor(val, left = null, right = null, next = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
        this.next = next;
    }
}

var connect = function(root) {
    if (root === null) return root;

    // Start with the first level
    let currLevel = root;

    while (currLevel !== null) {
        // Dummy node to build the list of the next level
        let dummy = new Node(0);
        let prev = dummy;

        // Iterate over the current level
        let curr = currLevel;
        while (curr !== null) {
            if (curr.left !== null) {
                prev.next = curr.left;
                prev = prev.next;
            }
            if (curr.right !== null) {
                prev.next = curr.right;
                prev = prev.next;
            }
            curr = curr.next;
        }

        // Move to the next level
        currLevel = dummy.next;
    }

    return root;
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is **O(n)** where **n** is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.

The space complexity is **O(1)** extra space, aside from the recursion stack. This meets the requirement for constant extra space usage.
