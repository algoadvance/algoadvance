[Leetcode 995. Minimum Number of K Consecutive Bit Flips](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l995)
### Problem Statement

The problem is outlined as follows:

Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, you need to return the minimum number of `k`-bit flips required to make all the elements in the array equal to `1`. A `k`-bit flip flips `k` consecutive bits starting from any position in the array. If it is impossible to make all the elements `1`, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum size of the input array `nums`?**
   - The typical constraint for such problems is up to `10^5`.

2. **Can `k` be larger than the length of `nums`?**
   - No, `k` will be less than or equal to the length of `nums`.

3. **Is the input array `nums` guaranteed to contain only binary elements (0s and 1s)?**
   - Yes, `nums` contains only 0s and 1s.

### Strategy

1. **Greedy Approach with Range flips**:
   - Maintain an array `isFlipped` to track the positions where flips start.
   - Use a variable `flipCount` to track the current state of flips as we iterate through `nums`.
   - Iterate through the array:
     - Flip if the current bit is mismatched based on `flipCount`.
     - Adjust `flipCount` using `isFlipped` when moving out of a `k`-range flip.
   - If at any point we need to flip starting from a position where it is impossible to complete a `k`-bit flip due to reaching the end of `nums`, return `-1`.

2. **Efficient Tracking**:
   - Use a variable to keep the state of flips instead of keeping a flipped array throughout.
   - Simulate flipping with a sliding window technique.

### Code

```javascript
function minKBitFlips(nums, k) {
    const n = nums.length;
    let flipCount = 0;
    let isFlipped = Array(n).fill(0);
    let answer = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        flipCount ^= isFlipped[i];
        
        if (nums[i] == flipCount) {
            if (i + k > n) return -1;
            answer++;
            flipCount ^= 1;
            if (i + k < n) {
                isFlipped[i + k] ^= 1;
            }
        }
    }

    return answer;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. Each element in the array is processed a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` due to the additional array `isFlipped` used.

This approach ensures that we efficiently compute the minimum number of flips required by maintaining an additional array to help track the state of flips in a sliding window manner.
