[Leetcode 993. Cousins in Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l993)
### Problem Statement

In a binary tree, the root node is at depth 0, and children of each depth k node are at depth k+1.

Two nodes are _cousins_ if they have the same depth but different parents.

Given the root of a binary tree with unique values, and the values x and y of two different nodes in the tree, return `true` if and only if the nodes corresponding to the values x and y are cousins.

#### Example

```plaintext
Input: root = [1,2,3,4], x = 4, y = 3
Output: false

Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4,null,5], x = 5, y = 4
Output: true

Input: root = [1,2,3,null,4], x = 2, y = 3
Output: false
```

#### Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[2, 100]`.
- Node values are between `1` and `100`.
- Each of the values `x` and `y` are unique.
- `x != y`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are there any special edge cases we should consider, such as one or both of the nodes not existing in the tree?
    - It is guaranteed that both x and y exist in the tree since they are mentioned in the input constraints.

2. Is it necessary to consider the direct children of the root as cousins (since the `x` and `y` are unique, and given tree depth >= 2)?
    - No, we don't need to worry specifically because our logic will naturally handle such cases.

### Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: This is a suitable strategy for level-order traversal, which will be useful in checking the depth and parent nodes. 
2. **Tracking Depth and Parent**: As we perform BFS, we will track the depth and parent for each node. At the end of the traversal:
   - Check if `x` and `y` have the same depth and different parents.

### Code

```javascript
function isCousins(root, x, y) {
    if (root === null) return false;

    let queue = [[root, null, 0]];
    let xParent = null, yParent = null;
    let xDepth = -1, yDepth = -1;

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        let [node, parent, depth] = queue.shift();

        if (node.val === x) {
            xParent = parent;
            xDepth = depth;
        } else if (node.val === y) {
            yParent = parent;
            yDepth = depth;
        }

        if (xParent !== null && yParent !== null) {
            break;
        }

        if (node.left !== null) {
            queue.push([node.left, node, depth + 1]);
        }
        if (node.right !== null) {
            queue.push([node.right, node, depth + 1]);
        }
    }

    return (xDepth === yDepth) && (xParent !== yParent);
}
```

### Strategy Explanation

1. **Queue Initialization**: We start by initializing the queue with the root node, its parent (null), and its depth (0).
2. **BFS Traversal**: We apply BFS to visit each level, keep track of the parent and depth for nodes x and y.
3. **Parent and Depth Check**: If we identify both nodes, we stop the traversal early and check if they qualify as cousins:
   - Both should have the same depth.
   - Both should have different parent nodes.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because, in the worst case, we need to visit every node.
- Space complexity is also O(N) due to the queue which can potentially hold all nodes in the tree in the worst case (when the tree is level-wise balanced).
