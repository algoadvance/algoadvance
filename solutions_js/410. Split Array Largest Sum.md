[Leetcode 410. Split Array Largest Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l410)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `m`. Split the array into `m` non-empty continuous subarrays minimizing the largest sum among these `m` subarrays.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: nums = [7,2,5,10,8], m = 2
Output: 18
Explanation: There are four ways to split nums into two subarrays.
    The best way is to split it into [7,2,5] and [10,8], where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 18.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5], m = 2
Output: 9
Explanation: There are several ways to split nums into two subarrays.
    The best way is to split it into [1,2,3,4] and [5], where the largest sum among the two subarrays is only 9.
```

**Constraints:**

* `1 <= nums.length <= 1000`
* `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^6`
* `1 <= m <= min(50, nums.length)`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the subarrays be empty?
   - No, each subarray must be non-empty.
   
2. What should we return if there's a single subarray (i.e., `m = 1`)?
   - Return the sum of all elements in `nums`.

3. Are the subarrays contiguous?
   - Yes, the subarrays must be contiguous.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can utilize binary search combined with a greedy algorithm to find the minimum possible largest sum when splitting the array into `m` subarrays.

1. **Define the search space:**
   - The lower boundary (`left`) is the maximum element in the array (since the largest subarray's sum must be at least the largest number in `nums`).
   - The upper boundary (`right`) is the sum of all elements in the array (if `m` is 1, the largest sum is the total sum of the array).

2. **Binary Search:**
   - Use binary search to find the minimum possible largest sum.
   - For each midpoint (`mid`) in our search space, check if it's possible to split the array into `m` or fewer subarrays such that the maximum sum of any subarray is less than or equal to `mid`.
   
3. **Greedy Check:**
   - Iterate through the array and use a greedy approach to determine the number of subarrays needed for the current midpoint. If at any point adding the next element causes the sum to exceed `mid`, start a new subarray.

## Code

```javascript
function splitArray(nums, m) {
    let left = Math.max(...nums);
    let right = nums.reduce((sum, num) => sum + num, 0);
  
    while (left < right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        if (canSplit(nums, m, mid)) {
            right = mid;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }
  
    return left;
}

function canSplit(nums, m, maxSum) {
    let currentSum = 0;
    let subarrays = 1;
  
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (currentSum + num > maxSum) {
            subarrays++;
            currentSum = num;
            if (subarrays > m) {
                return false;
            }
        } else {
            currentSum += num;
        }
    }
  
    return true;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(splitArray([7, 2, 5, 10, 8], 2)); // Output: 18
console.log(splitArray([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2));  // Output: 9
```

## Time Complexity

- **Binary search component:** The number of iterations is `O(log(Sum(nums) - Max(nums)))`, where `Sum(nums)` is the sum of all elements in `nums` and `Max(nums)` is the maximum element in `nums`.
- **Greedy check component:** For each midpoint in the binary search, we iterate through the array once, which is `O(n)` where `n` is the length of `nums`.

Combining these, the overall time complexity is:
- **`O(n * log(sum(nums) - max(nums)))`**

This approach should be efficient given the constraints.
