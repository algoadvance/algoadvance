[Leetcode 2231. Largest Number After Digit Swaps by Parity](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2231)
## Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer `num`. You may swap any two digits of `num` that have the same parity (i.e., both are odd digits or both are even digits). Return the largest possible value of `num` after any number of swaps.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Validity**: Are there any restrictions on the size of `num`?
   - Usually, `num` will be in the range that a typical integer can hold in JavaScript.
   
2. **Parity Definition**: To clarify, parity here means if the digits are both odd or both even?
   - Yes, only digits with the same parity can be swapped.

3. **Edge Cases**: What should be the behavior if all digits are the same or if there's only one digit?
   - If all digits are the same or if there's only one digit, the number would remain the same after any swaps.

## Strategy

1. **Extract Digits by Parity**: Separate digits of `num` into odd and even categories.
2. **Sort Digits**: Sort odd and even digits in descending order.
3. **Reconstruct Number**: Reconstruct the number by replacing original positions with the sorted digits according to their parity.
4. **Form Largest Possible Number**: Concatenate the reconstructed digits back into the largest possible number.

## Code

Here's a JavaScript implementation for the solution:

```javascript
function largestInteger(num) {
    // Extract digits from num and classify them by parity
    const digits = String(num).split('');
    const odds = [];
    const evens = [];
    
    for (let digit of digits) {
        if (digit % 2 === 0) {
            evens.push(digit);
        } else {
            odds.push(digit);
        }
    }
    
    // Sort the digits in descending order
    odds.sort((a, b) => b - a);
    evens.sort((a, b) => b - a);
    
    // Reconstruct the largest number possible by parity constraints
    let result = '';
    let oddIndex = 0;
    let evenIndex = 0;
    
    for (let digit of digits) {
        if (digit % 2 === 0) {
            result += evens[evenIndex++];
        } else {
            result += odds[oddIndex++];
        }
    }
    
    return parseInt(result, 10);
}
```

## Time Complexity

Let's analyze the time complexity for this solution.

- **Digit Extraction**: O(n), where `n` is the number of digits in `num`.
- **Sorting**: The sorting of both odd and even arrays is O(m log m) where `m` is the number of digits in either the odd or even array. Since each digit is either odd or even, the sorting operation's complexity is dominated by the largest of these two arrays. Let's say the maximum size is approximately `n/2`.
- **Reconstruction**: O(n) for constructing the resulting number.

Overall, the time complexity of the solution is O(n log n) due to the sorting step since sorting is the most expensive operation.
