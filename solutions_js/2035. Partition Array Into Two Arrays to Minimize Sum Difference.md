[Leetcode 2035. Partition Array Into Two Arrays to Minimize Sum Difference](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2035)
### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 2035:
Partition an array into two arrays to minimize the sum difference.

Given an array `nums` of `n` integers, partition the array into two arrays `num1` and `num2` such that the absolute difference between the sum of `num1` and the sum of `num2` is minimized. You should return the minimum absolute difference.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range and size of the input array `nums`?
   - The array length can be between 1 to 30 (1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 30).
   - The array values can be between -10^7 to 10^7.

2. Is the array guaranteed to have an even length?
   - Yes, the problem constraints ensure that `n` is even.

3. Is the input sorted?
   - No, the input array is not sorted.

4. Can the sum of elements be negative?
   - Yes, since the elements can be negative.

### Strategy

1. **Iterative approach for array partitioning**:
   - We need to find all subsets of `nums` and compute two equal-sized partitions.
   - Using Dynamic Programming or combinatorial approaches (like bitmasks) will help list out possible subsets.

2. **Optimize with meet in the middle**:
   - Given that `n` is up to 30, it's feasible to use the "meet in the middle" method.
   - We divide the array into two halves and explore all subset sums of each half.
   - By then matching valid combinations of subsets from each half, we can minimize the difference.

3. **Key steps**:
   - Generate all subset sums for each half.
   - Use binary search to find the closest sums to balance the two sides.

### Code

```javascript
const minimumDifference = function(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    const sum = nums.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
    const half = n / 2;
    const left = nums.slice(0, half);
    const right = nums.slice(half);

    // Helper function to get all subset sums
    const getAllSubsetSums = (arr) => {
        const result = new Map();
        const len = arr.length;

        for (let i = 0; i < (1 << len); i++) {
            let count = 0;
            let sum = 0;

            for (let j = 0; j < len; j++) {
                if (i & (1 << j)) {
                    count++;
                    sum += arr[j];
                }
            }
            if (!result.has(count)) {
                result.set(count, []);
            }
            result.get(count).push(sum);
        }
        return result;
    };

    const leftSubsets = getAllSubsetSums(left);
    const rightSubsets = getAllSubsetSums(right);

    for(let key of rightSubsets.keys()){
        rightSubsets.get(key).sort((a, b) => a - b);
    }

    let minDiff = Infinity;

    for (let leftCount of leftSubsets.keys()) {
        for(let leftSum of leftSubsets.get(leftCount)) {
            const rightList = rightSubsets.get(half - leftCount);
            if (rightList !== undefined) {
                let lo = 0, hi = rightList.length - 1;
                while (lo <= hi) {
                    let mid = Math.floor((lo + hi) / 2);
                    const current = leftSum + rightList[mid];
                    const diff = Math.abs((sum - current) - current);
                    minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, diff);

                    if(current < sum/2){
                        lo = mid + 1;
                    }else{
                        hi = mid - 1;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return minDiff;
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is:
- **Generating Subsets**: O(2^(n/2)) per half, hence overall O(2^n) in practice.
- **Sorting** subsets: O(2^(n/2) * log(2^(n/2))) is part of the preprocessing.
- **Binary Search Matching**: O(2^(n/2) * log(2^(n/2))).

Overall, the approach runs in **O(2^n)**, which is feasible for `n = 30`.
