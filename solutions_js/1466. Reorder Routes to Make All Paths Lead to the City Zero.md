[Leetcode 1466. Reorder Routes to Make All Paths Lead to the City Zero](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1466)
### Problem Statement

You are given `n` cities numbered from `0` to `n-1` and `n-1` roads such that there is only one way to travel between two different cities (this network forms a tree). 

Last year, the roads were changed to one-way roads such that each road is uni-directional.

Each `road[i] = [a, b]` indicates that there is a one-way road from city `a` to city `b`.

Your task is to reorient the minimum number of roads such that all roads lead to city `0`.

Return the minimum number of edges changed to direct all paths to city `0`.

**Example:**
```
Input: n = 6, roads = [[0,1],[1,3],[2,3],[4,0],[4,5]]
Output: 3
Explanation: Change the direction of roads [1,3], [2,3], and [4,5] to make them all lead to city 0.
```

### Clarifying Questions

- **Q: Can `n` be a small number like 1?**
  - A: Yes, `n` can range from 1 to a large number within constraints.
- **Q: Can there be multiple valid solutions?**
  - A: Yes, but you only need to return the minimum number of changes required.

### Strategy

1. **Understanding Tree Properties**: Notice that with `n - 1` roads and `n` cities, we have a tree structure.
2. **Graph Representation**: Use an adjacency list to represent the graph, where each node points to its children.
3. **DFS Traversal**: Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) to explore the graph:
    - Track which roads need reorientation by checking the direction of travel.
4. **Counting Changes**: While performing DFS, count the number of reorientations required to ensure all paths lead to city `0`.

### Code

```javascript
var minReorder = function(n, roads) {
    const adjList = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
    for (const [from, to] of roads) {
        adjList[from].push([to, 1]);
        adjList[to].push([from, 0]);
    }

    const visited = new Set();
    let changes = 0;

    const dfs = (node) => {
        visited.add(node);
        for (const [neighbor, direction] of adjList[node]) {
            if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
                changes += direction;
                dfs(neighbor);
            }
        }
    };

    dfs(0);
    return changes;
};

console.log(minReorder(6, [[0,1],[1,3],[2,3],[4,0],[4,5]])); // Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **Graph Construction**: The graph (adjacency list) construction takes `O(n)`.
- **DFS Traversal**: The DFS traversal takes `O(n)` as it visits each node and edge once.
- **Total Time Complexity**: `O(n)` which is efficient for the given constraints.
