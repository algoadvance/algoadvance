[Leetcode 2947. Count Beautiful Substrings I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2947)
### Problem Statement

Given a string, you need to count the number of beautiful substrings. A substring is considered beautiful if all the characters in the substring are distinct.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input include characters other than lowercase English letters?**
   - Typically, interview problems specify constraints. Clarify if the input is guaranteed to be lowercase English letters only.

2. **Is there a maximum length for the input string?**
   - Knowing this helps in determining if time-efficient algorithms are required.

3. **Do we need to consider empty strings or null values as inputs?**
   - Handling edge cases gracefully.

No specific constraints mentioned, assuming the input consists of lowercase English letters.

### Strategy

To find and count all beautiful substrings in a string efficiently, we can use the sliding window technique combined with a set to track unique characters within the window:

1. Use two pointers (`left` and `right`). Both start at the beginning of the string.
2. Expand the `right` pointer to include more characters into the current substring.
3. If a duplicate character is encountered, move the `left` pointer to the right until all characters are unique again.
4. For each position of `right`, the number of beautiful substrings ending at `right` is `(right - left + 1)`.
5. Sum up all these counts to get the total number of beautiful substrings.

### Code

```javascript
function countBeautifulSubstrings(s) {
    let n = s.length;
    let left = 0;
    let seen = new Set();
    let totalBeautifulSubstrings = 0;

    for (let right = 0; right < n; right++) {
        while (seen.has(s[right])) {
            seen.delete(s[left]);
            left++;
        }
        seen.add(s[right]);
        totalBeautifulSubstrings += (right - left + 1);
    }

    return totalBeautifulSubstrings;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(countBeautifulSubstrings("abcd")); // Output: 10
console.log(countBeautifulSubstrings("abca")); // Output: 10
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string. Each character is processed by the `right` pointer exactly once, and each character is added and removed from the set at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(min(n, m)), where n is the length of the string and m is the number of unique characters the alphabet can have (26 for lowercase English letters). The set can grow up to the size of the unique alphabet or the substring being considered.

This solution efficiently counts all beautiful substrings within the given constraints.
