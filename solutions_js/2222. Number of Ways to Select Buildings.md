[Leetcode 2222. Number of Ways to Select Buildings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2222)
Sure, let's go through it step-by-step.

### Problem Statement
You are given a binary string `s` where:
- `s[i]` is either '0' (representing a vacant land) or '1' (representing a factory).

You want to select exactly three positions `i < j < k` such that:
- `s[i] == '0'`
- `s[j] == '1'`
- `s[k] == '0'`

Return the number of ways that you can select such three positions.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the length of the string `s` be very long?**
   - Yes, it can be up to 100,000.
   
2. **Are the characters in the string exclusively '0' and '1'?**
   - Yes, the string contains only '0's and '1's.

3. **Do we only want unique positions?**
   - Yes, the positions must be unique and follow the constraints `i < j < k`.

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently:

1. **Count Sub-approach**:
   - Traverse the string and keep track of the number of '0's seen so far at each position.
   - This helps in determining how many valid '0's are there before any '1' we encounter.
   - Likewise, traverse backward to keep track of the number of '0's seen so far after each position for a valid '1'.
   - Use this information to count valid `(i, j, k)` combinations.

### Code

```javascript
function numberOfWays(s) {
    const n = s.length;
    if (n < 3) return 0;
    
    let count0Before = Array(n).fill(0);
    let count0After = Array(n).fill(0);
    
    // Traversal to fill count0Before
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        count0Before[i] = count0Before[i-1] + (s[i-1] === '0' ? 1 : 0);
    }
    
    // Traversal to fill count0After
    for (let i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        count0After[i] = count0After[i+1] + (s[i+1] === '0' ? 1 : 0);
    }
    
    let ways = 0;
    
    // Count combinations of '0' ? '1' ? '0'
    for (let j = 1; j < n - 1; j++) {
        if (s[j] === '1') {
            ways += count0Before[j] * count0After[j];
        }
    }
    
    return ways;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(numberOfWays("01001")); // Output: 3
console.log(numberOfWays("001101")); // Output: 6
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the string.
  - We traverse the string a few times, but each traversal is linear.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for the auxiliary arrays (`count0Before` and `count0After`).

This ensures efficient processing even for longer strings.
