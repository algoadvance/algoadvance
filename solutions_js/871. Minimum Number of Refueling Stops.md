[Leetcode 871. Minimum Number of Refueling Stops](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l871)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `target` denoting the distance to a destination, an integer `startFuel` denoting the initial amount of fuel in the car, and an array `stations` where `stations[i] = [position_i, fuel_i]` represents that there is a gas station at position `position_i` with `fuel_i` liters of fuel.

Your task is to return the minimum number of refueling stops required to reach the destination. If it is not possible to reach the destination, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the order in which we encounter the stations within the array provided guaranteed to be in increasing order of their positions?**
   - Yes, the stations are given in increasing order of their positions.
   
2. **Can the positions of the stations exceed the target?**
   - No, the positions of the stations will be within the range `[0, target]`.

3. **Is the `startFuel` and `fuel_i` guaranteed to be non-negative?**
   - Yes, all fuel values (including `startFuel` and each `fuel_i`) are guaranteed to be non-negative integers.

### Strategy

1. **Approach:**
   - Use a Max-Heap (priority queue) to always refuel from the station that provides the maximum fuel encountered so far.
   - As we move towards the destination, add fuel values of the stations we pass to the Max-Heap.
   - When we run out of fuel before reaching the next station or the destination, refuel from the station offering the maximum fuel value encountered (by popping from the Max-Heap).
   - Continue this until we can reach the destination or we determine it's not possible.

2. **Steps:**
   - Initialize a max-heap (priority queue).
   - Track the current position and current fuel.
   - Iterate through the given stations:
     - For each station, move through the distance and add encountered fuel to heap.
     - If current fuel is insufficient to proceed, use fuel from the max-heap.
   - If after processing all stations we still haven't reached the target, check once more if we need one last refuel from the heap.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - Directly reaching the target with the initial fuel without needing any stops.
   - Stations are provided at the distance equal to the target exactly.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity for this solution will be `O(N log N)` where `N` is the number of stations, primarily due to the heap operations (insertion and extraction).
  
### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} target
 * @param {number} startFuel
 * @param {number[][]} stations
 * @return {number}
 */
var minRefuelStops = function(target, startFuel, stations) {
    const maxHeap = new MaxPriorityQueue({ priority: x => x });
    let currentFuel = startFuel;
    let i = 0;
    let stops = 0;
    
    while (currentFuel < target) {
        // Add all reachable stations to the max heap
        while (i < stations.length && currentFuel >= stations[i][0]) {
            maxHeap.enqueue(stations[i][1]);
            i++;
        }
        
        // If no more stations are reachable and we haven't reached the target
        if (maxHeap.size() === 0) return -1;
        
        // Refuel with the most fuel available from the max-heap
        currentFuel += maxHeap.dequeue().element;
        stops++;
    }
    
    return stops;
};
```

### Example for Testing

```javascript
console.log(minRefuelStops(100, 10, [[10,60],[20,30],[30,30],[60,40]])); // Output: 2
console.log(minRefuelStops(100, 1, [[10,100]])); // Output: -1
console.log(minRefuelStops(1, 1, [])); // Output: 0
```

***Explanation for Examples:***

1. **First Example:**
   - Initial fuel is `10`, so we can't move beyond first station at position `10`.
   - Refuel at station (`10, 60`), now fuel is `70`.
   - Move to station at position `60`, refuel again (`60, 40`), now fuel is `110` and destination is reachable. Answer is `2 stops`.

2. **Second Example:**
   - Initial fuel is `1` which is not enough to reach the first station or target. Answer is `-1`.

3. **Third Example:**
   - Distance is `1` and initial fuel is `1`, no need for refuel. Answer is `0 stops`.
