[Leetcode 2960. Count Tested Devices After Test Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2960)
### Problem Statement

You have a number of tested and untested devices in two different lists: `tested` and `untested`. There are also three types of operations you can perform:

1. "TEST x": Move device `x` from `untested` to `tested`.
2. "UNTEST x": Move device `x` from `tested` to `untested`.
3. "COUNT": Output the number of devices in `tested`.

You need to process a list of operations and output the results of each "COUNT" operation.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all device IDs unique?**
   - Yes, each device ID is unique and present only in one of the lists.
   
2. **What is the format of the operations and lists?**
   - The lists `tested` and `untested` are arrays of strings where each string is a unique device ID.
   - The `operations` list contains strings where each string is an operation ("TEST x", "UNTEST x", or "COUNT").

3. **What if a "TEST" or "UNTEST" operation tries to move a device that isn't in the current list?**
   - Ignore such operations.

### Strategy

To solve this problem:

1. **Use Sets**: Convert the `tested` and `untested` arrays into sets for O(1) average-time complexity for insertions, deletions, and checks.
  
2. **Process Operations**: Iterate through the operations list and perform the required operations using the sets.
   
3. **Counting**: For each "COUNT" operation, append the length of the `tested` set to the result list.

### Code

Here is the JavaScript code to solve the problem:

```javascript
function processOperations(tested, untested, operations) {
    // Convert arrays to sets for O(1) average time complexity operations
    let testedSet = new Set(tested);
    let untestedSet = new Set(untested);
    let result = [];

    for (let operation of operations) {
        let [op, device] = operation.split(' ');
        
        switch(op) {
            case 'TEST':
                if (untestedSet.has(device)) {
                    untestedSet.delete(device);
                    testedSet.add(device);
                }
                break;

            case 'UNTEST':
                if (testedSet.has(device)) {
                    testedSet.delete(device);
                    untestedSet.add(device);
                }
                break;

            case 'COUNT':
                result.push(testedSet.size);
                break;

            default:
                console.log(`Unknown operation: ${operation}`);
        }
    }

    return result;
}

// Test case
const tested = ["device1", "device2"];
const untested = ["device3", "device4"];
const operations = ["COUNT", "TEST device3", "COUNT", "UNTEST device1", "COUNT", "TEST device5", "COUNT"];

console.log(processOperations(tested, untested, operations)); // [2, 3, 2, 2]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: Converting arrays to sets takes O(n + m), where `n` is the length of `tested` and `m` is the length of `untested`.
- **Operations**: Each operation ("TEST x", "UNTEST x", "COUNT") is performed in O(1) average time.
  
Thus, if there are `k` operations, the overall time complexity is O(n + m + k).

This strategy ensures that even with a large number of devices and operations, the solution remains efficient.
