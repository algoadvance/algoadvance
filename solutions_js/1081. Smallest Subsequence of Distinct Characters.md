[Leetcode 1081. Smallest Subsequence of Distinct Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1081)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return the lexicographically smallest subsequence of `s` that contains all the distinct characters of `s` exactly once.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can `s` contain both uppercase and lowercase letters?
   - **A:** For this problem, assume `s` contains only lowercase English letters.
   
2. **Q:** What should be the output for an empty string input?
   - **A:** An empty string should return an empty string since there are no characters to consider.

3. **Q:** Should the order of characters in the output retain the order of their first occurrence in `s`?
   - **A:** No, the task is to return the smallest lexicographical order sequence of distinct characters.

### Strategy

1. **Frequency Count:** First, count the frequency of each character in the string.
2. **Stack for Result:** Use a stack to build the resultant string in a way that maintains both the order and the lexicographical requirement.
3. **Visited Set:** Maintain a set to check which characters have been added to the stack.
4. **Iterate through the String:**
   - For each character, if it's already in the stack, decrement its frequency and continue.
   - If it's not in the stack, use a while-loop to ensure the stack top follows the smallest lexicographical order, considering future availability of characters.

### Algorithm

1. Use a frequency dictionary to count occurrences of each character in the string.
2. Initialize an empty stack to build the result and a set to keep track of characters in the stack.
3. Iterate over the characters in the string:
   - Decrease the frequency count of the current character.
   - If the character is already in the set, continue to the next character.
   - If not, while the stack is not empty and the top character is lexicographically greater than the current character and the top character appears later in the string (frequency > 0), pop from the stack and remove it from the set.
   - Push the current character onto the stack and add it to the set.
4. Join and return the stack as the final result string.

### Code

```javascript
function smallestSubsequence(s) {
    // Frequency dictionary to count occurrences of each character
    let freq = {};
    for (let char of s) {
        freq[char] = (freq[char] || 0) + 1;
    }

    // Stack to keep the characters of the result subsequence
    let stack = [];
    // Set to keep track of characters in the stack
    let inStack = new Set();

    for (let char of s) {
        // Decrement count for the current character
        freq[char]--;

        // If the character is already in the stack, skip it
        if (inStack.has(char)) continue;

        // Ensure the stack maintains smallest lexicographical order
        while (stack.length > 0 && stack[stack.length - 1] > char && freq[stack[stack.length - 1]] > 0) {
            inStack.delete(stack.pop());
        }

        // Push the current character to the stack and mark it as added
        stack.push(char);
        inStack.add(char);
    }

    return stack.join('');
}

// Example usage:
console.log(smallestSubsequence("bcabc"));  // Output: "abc"
console.log(smallestSubsequence("cbacdcbc"));  // Output: "acdb"
```

### Time Complexity

- **Frequency Count:** O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`.
- **Iteration through String:** O(n), each character is processed in constant time.
- **Stack Operations:** Each character is pushed and popped from the stack at most once, leading to O(n) operations.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.
