[Leetcode 829. Consecutive Numbers Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l829)
### Problem Statement

Given a positive integer `n`, return the number of ways `n` can be written as the sum of consecutive positive integers.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the integer `n`?**
   - `1 <= n <= 10^9`

2. **Can `n` be expressed as a sum in only one way, which is just `n` itself?**
   - Yes, `n` itself is considered a single way and should be included in the count if it qualifies.

3. **Are the sums required to have more than one term (i.e., must the expression have at least two terms)?**
   - No, a single term is allowed.

4. **What is an example input and output?**
   - Example: `n = 5` should return `2` since 5 can be written as `5` and `2 + 3`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to find how many ways `n` can be written as the sum of consecutive integers. 

We represent `n` as a sum of `k` consecutive integers starting from `x`. Therefore:
\[ n = x + (x + 1) + (x + 2) + ... + (x + k - 1) \]

This can be simplified into:
\[ n = kx + \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \]
where \( x \) is the starting integer and \( k \) is the number of terms.

Rearrange the formula to solve for `x`:
\[ kx = n - \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \]
\[ x = \frac{n - \frac{k(k-1)}{2}}{k} \]

For `x` to be a positive integer,
\[ n - \frac{k(k-1)}{2} \]
must be divisible by `k`.

We iterate over the possible values for `k`, starting from `1`. The maximum possible value for `k` happens when:
\[ \frac{k(k-1)}{2} < n \rightarrow k^2 < 2n + k \rightarrow k < \sqrt{2n} \]

### Code

```javascript
function consecutiveNumbersSum(n) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let k = 1; k * (k - 1) / 2 < n; k++) {
        if ((n - k * (k - 1) / 2) % k === 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(\sqrt{2n})\) because the loop runs while \(k < \sqrt{2n}\). Given the constraints, this approach efficiently handles large values of `n` up to \(10^9\).

### Example

```javascript
console.log(consecutiveNumbersSum(5)); // Output: 2
console.log(consecutiveNumbersSum(9)); // Output: 3
console.log(consecutiveNumbersSum(15)); // Output: 4
```

- **For `n = 5`**: The possible sequences are `[5]` and `[2, 3]`.
- **For `n = 9`**: The possible sequences are `[9]`, `[4, 5]`, and `[2, 3, 4]`.
- **For `n = 15`**: The possible sequences are `[15]`, `[7, 8]`, `[4, 5, 6]`, and `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.

This approach ensures we correctly identify all possible ways to express `n` as the sum of consecutive numbers.
