[Leetcode 55. Jump Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l55)
## Problem Statement:

**Jump Game**

You are given an integer array `nums`. You are initially positioned at the array's first index, and each element in the array represents your maximum jump length at that position.

Return `true` if you can reach the last index, or `false` otherwise.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [2,3,1,1,4]
Output: true
Explanation: Jump 1 step from index 0 to 1, then 3 steps to the last index.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [3,2,1,0,4]
Output: false
Explanation: You will always arrive at index 3 no matter what. Its maximum jump length is 0, which prevents you from reaching the last index.
```

## Clarifying Questions:

1. Can the input array `nums` be empty?
   - No, the array will have at least one element.
2. What is the range of the values in the array?
   - The values in the array will be non-negative integers.
3. Do we need to handle any special cases, like very large arrays?
   - Assume typical constraints for competitive programming, usually arrays can be rather large.

## Strategy:

In order to solve the problem, we will use a greedy algorithm approach:
1. Initialize a variable `maxReach` to keep track of the maximum index that can be reached.
2. Iterate through each index of the array.
   - For each index, update `maxReach` to be the maximum of the current `maxReach` and the sum of the current index and the value at that index (`i + nums[i]`).
   - If `maxReach` is >= the last index of the array, return `true`.
   - If the current index is greater than `maxReach`, then it's not possible to reach any further and we should return `false`.

## Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. This is because we only need to iterate through the array once.
- The space complexity is `O(1)` as we are using only a constant amount of extra space.

## Code:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var canJump = function(nums) {
    let maxReach = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (i > maxReach) {
            return false;
        }
        maxReach = Math.max(maxReach, i + nums[i]);
        if (maxReach >= nums.length - 1) {
            return true;
        }
    }

    return false;
};

// Test cases
console.log(canJump([2, 3, 1, 1, 4])); // true
console.log(canJump([3, 2, 1, 0, 4])); // false
console.log(canJump([0])); // true
console.log(canJump([2, 0, 0])); // true
console.log(canJump([1, 2, 3])); // true
console.log(canJump([2, 5, 0, 0])); // true
```

By methodically checking the farthest we can reach at each step, we can efficiently determine whether it's possible to reach the last index.
