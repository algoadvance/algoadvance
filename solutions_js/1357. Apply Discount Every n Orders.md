[Leetcode 1357. Apply Discount Every n Orders](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1357)
## Problem Statement

An online store offers a discount every `n` orders. The discount varies based on the total price of the products in the cart. The store keeps track of the number of orders and applies the discount automatically after every `n` orders.

Implement the `Cashier` class that includes the following methods:

1. `constructor(n: number, discount: number, products: number[], prices: number[])`: This method initializes the object with:
   - An integer `n`, representing the frequency of applying the discount.
   - An integer `discount`, representing the discount percentage.
   - Two lists, `products` and `prices`, where `products[i]` is the `i-th` product's ID and `prices[i]` is the price of the `i-th` product.

2. `getBill(product: number[], amount: number[]): number`: This method:
   - Takes two lists, `product` and `amount`, where `product[i]` indicates the ID of the `i-th` product and `amount[i]` indicates the quantity of the `i-th` product.
   - Determines the total bill for the given products and quantities.
   - Applies the discount if this is the `n-th` order since the object's initialization or the last discount was applied.
   - Returns the final bill as a float.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the discount applied only to orders that are exactly the `n-th` order, or from the `n-th` order onwards?**
   - The discount is applied exactly on the `n-th` order. Any orders between two `n-th` orders aren't discounted.

2. **Should the method `getBill` store or remember the number of orders processed?**
   - Yes, it should increment the count of orders and reset after applying the discount.

3. **What should be the response if the method `getBill` is called before `n` is reached?**
   - The method should return the total without applying any discount.

## Code

```javascript
class Cashier {
    constructor(n, discount, products, prices) {
        this.n = n;
        this.discount = discount;
        this.products = {};
        this.currentOrderCount = 0;

        for (let i = 0; i < products.length; i++) {
            this.products[products[i]] = prices[i];
        }
    }

    getBill(product, amount) {
        let totalBill = 0;

        for (let i = 0; i < product.length; i++) {
            const productId = product[i];
            const productAmount = amount[i];
            totalBill += this.products[productId] * productAmount;
        }

        this.currentOrderCount++;
        
        // Apply discount if currentOrderCount is n
        if (this.currentOrderCount === this.n) {
            totalBill = totalBill * (1 - this.discount / 100);
            this.currentOrderCount = 0; // Reset count after applying discount
        }

        return totalBill;
    }
}

// Example usage
const n = 3;
const discount = 50;
const products = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const prices = [100, 200, 300, 400, 500];

const cashier = new Cashier(n, discount, products, prices);
console.log(cashier.getBill([1, 2], [1, 2])); // Returns 500.0 since it's the 1st order
console.log(cashier.getBill([3, 4], [1, 1])); // Returns 700.0 since it's the 2nd order
console.log(cashier.getBill([1, 2, 3], [1, 2, 1])); // Returns 800.0 with a 50% discount applied since it's the 3rd order
console.log(cashier.getBill([4, 5], [1, 1])); // Returns 900 since it's the 1st order after reset
```

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Use the constructor to set up the necessary properties, such as the discount frequency (`n`), the discount percentage, and a dictionary to map product IDs to their prices.
2. **Bill Calculation**: The `getBill` method iterates through the list of products and sums up the total amount based on the provided quantities and prices.
3. **Order Counting**: Each call to `getBill` increments the order count. When the order count reaches `n`, the discount is applied, and the order count is reset.
4. **Discount Application**: Apply the discount by modifying the total bill when the order count reaches `n`.

## Time Complexity

1. **Initialization (`O(m)`)**: Creating the product-price mapping takes linear time, where `m` is the number of products.
2. **Billing (`O(k)`)**: Calculating the bill requires iterating through the list of products in the current order, where `k` is the length of the product list for that order.

Thus, the overall time complexity for each operation is efficient and manageable.
