[Leetcode 2617. Minimum Number of Visited Cells in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2617)
### Problem Statement
You are given an `m x n` grid consisting of non-negative integers. Your task is to find the minimum number of cells you need to visit to travel from the top-left cell `(0, 0)` to the bottom-right cell `(m-1, n-1)`. You can only move to adjacent cells, moving right, left, up, or down. 

The grid has the following properties:
1. Cells contain non-negative integers.
2. You start at the top-left cell `(0, 0)` (topmost cell in the leftmost column) and want to reach the bottom-right cell `(m-1, n-1)` (bottom-most cell in the rightmost column).
3. You can only move cell-to-cell in the mentioned directions if the cell you're moving into has a value strictly greater than that of the current cell. Specifically, if your current cell has a value `x`, you may only move into cells containing a value greater than `x`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are diagonal movements allowed? 
   - **No**, only horizontal and vertical movements.
2. Should we consider grids where the movement might not be possible?
   - **Yes**, we should return `-1` if itâ€™s impossible to reach the target.
3. Are there any constraints on the grid size?
   - The problem does not specify size constraints, but we can assume typical constraints found in competitive programming problems to optimize our solution.

### Strategy
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - Given that we need the minimum number of cells to reach the target, BFS is a suitable choice because it explores all possible paths level by level.
   - We will maintain a queue to store the coordinates of the current cell and the number of steps taken to reach it.
   - We'll use a 2D array `visited` to track which cells have been visited.

2. **Implementation Steps**:
   - Initialize the BFS queue and visited list.
   - Perform BFS to explore all the possible paths.
   - For each cell, check movements in all four directions (right, left, up, down).
   - If the destination cell `(m-1, n-1)` is reached, return the number of steps.
   - If the queue is exhausted without reaching the destination, return `-1`.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns, due to each cell being visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(m * n)` for the `visited` array and the queue.

### Code
```javascript
function minNumberOfVisitedCells(grid) {
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;

    const directions = [[1, 0], [0, 1], [-1, 0], [0, -1]];  // down, right, up, left
    const inBounds = (x, y) => x >= 0 && x < m && y >= 0 && y < n;

    const queue = [[0, 0, 1]];  // [x, y, steps]
    const visited = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(false));
    visited[0][0] = true;

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const [x, y, steps] = queue.shift();

        // If reached the bottom-right cell
        if (x === m - 1 && y === n - 1) {
            return steps;
        }

        for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
            const nx = x + dx;
            const ny = y + dy;

            if (inBounds(nx, ny) && !visited[nx][ny] && grid[nx][ny] > grid[x][y]) {
                queue.push([nx, ny, steps + 1]);
                visited[nx][ny] = true;
            }
        }
    }

    return -1;
}

// Example usage:
const grid = [
    [1, 3, 1],
    [3, 2, 4],
    [5, 1, 6]
];
console.log(minNumberOfVisitedCells(grid));  // Output should be 5 in this case if possible
```

This code defines a function to solve the problem using BFS while considering movement in only allowed directions and ensuring that we can only move to cells with values strictly greater than the current cell. It returns the minimum steps required to reach the destination or `-1` if it's not possible.
