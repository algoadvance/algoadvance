[Leetcode 1042. Flower Planting With No Adjacent](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1042)
## Problem Statement

There are n gardens in a garden, and each garden can be planted with one of 4 types of flowers. There are paths between some gardens in such a way that no garden has more than 3 paths coming out of it.

You need to choose a flower type for each garden, such that, for any two gardens connected by a path, they have different types of flowers.

Given n and an array `paths` where `paths[i] = [x_i, y_i]` describes a path between garden x_i and garden y_i, return any valid array `answer` of length n where `answer[i]` is the type of flower planted in the (i + 1)-th garden. The types of flowers are denoted 1, 2, 3, and 4.

### Example:
```
Input: n = 3, paths = [[1,2],[2,3],[3,1]]
Output: [1,2,3]
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 10^4`
- `0 <= paths.length <= 2 * 10^4`
- `paths[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= x_i, y_i <= n`
- All gardens have no more than 3 paths coming out of them.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can there be multiple paths between the same gardens?
2. Can the path array be empty meaning no garden is connected?
3. Is there a unique solution always possible for this problem?

## Strategy
Given the constraints and requirements, we can use a Greedy approach:

1. Represent the garden connections using a graph (adjacency list).
2. For each garden, assign a flower type that is different from its directly connected gardens.
3. Ensure that while assigning a flower to a garden, we check the flowers of already assigned neighboring gardens and avoid them.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} paths
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var gardenNoAdj = function(n, paths) {
    // Step 1: Create an adjacency list for the gardens
    const adj = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
    for (const [x, y] of paths) {
        adj[x - 1].push(y - 1);
        adj[y - 1].push(x - 1);
    }

    // Step 2: Create an array to store the flower types for each garden
    const flowers = Array(n).fill(0);

    // Step 3: Assign flowers using greedy approach
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Get the flowers of the neighboring gardens
        const neighborFlowers = new Set(adj[i].map(neighbor => flowers[neighbor]));
        
        // Assign the first valid flower type (1 to 4) that is not used by any neighbor
        for (let f = 1; f <= 4; f++) {
            if (!neighborFlowers.has(f)) {
                flowers[i] = f;
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    return flowers;
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Building the Adjacency List:** O(m) where m is the number of paths (edges).
- **Assigning Flowers:** O(n + m) because we iterate over each garden and its neighbors.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n + m), which is efficient given the constraints.
