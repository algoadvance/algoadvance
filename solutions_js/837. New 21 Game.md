[Leetcode 837. New 21 Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l837)
### Problem Statement

Alice plays the following game, loosely based on the card game "21".

Alice starts with `0` points and has a goal of `k` points. She draws numbers from the range `[1, maxPts]` to accumulate points. Each draw is independent and each number in the range is equally likely. Alice stops drawing numbers when she reaches or exceeds `k` points.

Alice wins if she ends up with a score of `k` points or less. Given `k`, `maxPts`, and an integer `n`, which represents the maximum points Alice is willing to risk, return the probability that Alice has `n` or fewer points.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What happens if `k` is 0 or `maxPts` is 0?**  
    If `k` is 0, Alice starts with 0 points and can't draw any cards, which means she automatically wins if `n >= 0`.  
    If `maxPts` is 0, Alice can't draw any cards, and it's not a valid scenario given the problem constraints.

2. **Can `maxPts` be larger than `k`?**  
    Yes, `maxPts` can be larger than `k`. This affects the strategy Alice uses to draw cards.

3. **What are the constraints on the values of `k`, `maxPts`, and `n`?**  
    Let's assume typical constraints for a computational problem, where `k`, `maxPts`, and `n` are positive integers and within reasonable limits for solving in a coding interview scenario.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
    - Use a dynamic programming table (`dp`) where `dp[i]` represents the probability of reaching exactly `i` points.
    - Base Case: `dp[0] = 1` because Alice starts with 0 points with a probability of 1.
    - Transition: For each point `i` from 1 to `k`, `dp[i]` can be calculated by summing up probabilities `dp[i - j]` for `1 <= j <= maxPts`.
    - Use a sliding window to efficiently calculate the sum of probabilities to avoid recalculating sums repeatedly.

2. **Cumulative Probability Maintenance**:
    - Maintain a cumulative probability sum to handle the transition efficiently using a sliding window.

3. **Calculate the Result**:
    - Sum the probabilities for scores from `k` to `n` to get the final result.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this approach is O(k + maxPts), where `k` is the target points and `maxPts` is the range to draw from.
- Efficient use of a sliding window ensures that each state is only processed once in amortized O(1) time.

### Code

```javascript
var new21Game = function(n, k, maxPts) {
    if (k === 0 || n >= k + maxPts) return 1.0;
    
    const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    dp[0] = 1.0;
    let windowSum = 1.0, result = 0.0;
    
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        dp[i] = windowSum / maxPts;
        if (i < k) {
            windowSum += dp[i];
        } else {
            result += dp[i];
        }
        if (i >= maxPts) {
            windowSum -= dp[i - maxPts];
        }
    }
    
    return result;
};
```

This solution initializes a dynamic programming table, uses a sliding window to maintain the sum of probabilities efficiently, and computes the result by summing the probabilities for valid endpoint scenarios.

### Explanation

1. **Initialization**: Start with a DP table filled with 0's except for `dp[0]`, which is 1 because Alice starts at 0 points.
2. **Sliding Window**: Use a cumulative sum (`windowSum`) to maintain the sum of probabilities within the window size `maxPts`.
3. **DP Transition**:
    - For each point `i`, calculate `dp[i]` as the average probability from the previous `maxPts` points.
    - Update the `windowSum` by adding the current `dp[i]` if `i < k` (as Alice hasn't stopped drawing yet).
    - If `i` is beyond `maxPts`, deduct the oldest point from `windowSum` to maintain the sliding window.
4. **Result Calculation**: Sum the probabilities `dp[i]` for all `i` in the range `[k, n]` to get the final win probability.
