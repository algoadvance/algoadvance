[Leetcode 2550. Count Collisions of Monkeys on a Polygon](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2550)
## Problem Statement
We have a regular polygon with \( n \) sides and \( n \ vertices, and there are \( n \) monkeys, each sitting at a distinct vertex of the polygon. Simultaneously, each monkey randomly picks one of the two adjacent edges and starts traveling along it to the next vertex. We need to return the number of ways the monkeys can start their journey such that no two monkeys collide on an edge.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Monkey Movement**: Do monkeys continue to move in their chosen direction indefinitely, or do we only consider their initial movement?
   - We only consider the initial movement to the adjacent vertices.
   
2. **Collision**: A collision is when two monkeys move towards each other on the same edge, correct?
   - Yes, a collision happens when two monkeys move towards each other on the same edge.

3. **Constraints**: Are there any limits on \( n \)?
   - The main constraint is that \( n \) (the number of sides/vertices) should be at least 3.

## Strategy
1. **Observations**:
   - Monkeys can either move clockwise (CW) or counterclockwise (CCW). Let's define CW as +1 and CCW as -1 (or vice versa).

2. **No Collision Requirement**:
   - No collision will happen if all monkeys either move CW or all move CCW. In both scenarios, no monkey will collide.

3. **Combinatorial Counting**:
   - There are two valid ways:
     1. All monkeys move CW.
     2. All monkeys move CCW.

4. **Total Possible Arrangements**:
   - Each monkey has 2 choices (CW or CCW), so there are a total of \(2^n\) possible ways for the monkeys to move.

5. **Non-Colliding Arrangements**:
   - As reasoned earlier, there are only 2 non-colliding arrangements (all CW or all CCW).

6. **General Formula**:
   - The number of ways the monkeys can start without collision is \(2\), and the number of total arrangements is \(2^n\). Therefore, the result is given by:
     \( \text{Total non-colliding ways} = 2 \)

## Time Complexity
For this solution, the number of operations is constant with respect to \( n \), so the time complexity is \( O(1) \).

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var countCollisions = function(n) {
    if (n < 3) throw new Error("Polygon must have at least 3 sides");
    return 2;
};
```

The above solution directly returns \(2\) for any \( n \geq 3\), reflecting that there are always 2 non-colliding ways for monkeys regardless of the number of vertices.
