[Leetcode 2516. Take K of Each Character From Left and Right](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2516)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting of the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c' and an integer `k`. You need to take exactly `k` of each character from the start and the end of the string `s`. The exact `k` characters you select should be such that their removal from `s` leaves a substring that still contains exactly `k` 'a's, `k` 'b's, and `k` 'c's.

Return the minimum length of that substring.

If it is impossible to do so, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What if `k` is greater than the number of any character in the string?**
   - If `k` is greater than the number of any character in the string, it's impossible to take `k` characters, and we should return -1.

2. **Is the input string guaranteed to contain only characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'?**
   - Yes, the problem statement guarantees that the string consists only of the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.

3. **Can the input string be empty?**
   - If the input string is empty or its length is less than `2k`, return -1 since it's impossible to take `k` characters from both start and end.

### Strategy

1. **Check feasibility:** Ensure that each character 'a', 'b', and 'c' exists at least `k` times in the string. If not, return -1.
  
2. **Two-pointer approach:** Use two pointers to find the minimum length substring that fulfills the requirement.
   
   - Use one pointer starting from the beginning and another starting from the end.
   - Count the occurrences of characters towards the center until you've taken `k` characters.
   - Finally, compute the minimum length of the substring left when these characters are removed.

### Code

Here's the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function takeCharacters(s, k) {
    const n = s.length;
    if (k === 0) return n;

    let countA = 0, countB = 0, countC = 0;
    for (let char of s) {
        if (char === 'a') countA++;
        else if (char === 'b') countB++;
        else if (char === 'c') countC++;
    }
    
    if (countA < k || countB < k || countC < k) return -1;

    let leftCounts = {'a': 0, 'b': 0, 'c': 0};
    let rightCounts = {'a': 0, 'b': 0, 'c': 0};

    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        leftCounts[s[i]]++;
        rightCounts[s[n - 1 - i]]++;
    }
    
    // Two pointers to find the minimum length
    let i = k - 1, j = n - k, minLength = n - k * 2;
    
    while (rightCounts[s[j]] > k) {
        j--;
        rightCounts[s[j]]--;
    }
    
    while (i >= 0) {
        while (j < n && rightCounts[s[j]] < k) {
            rightCounts[s[j]]++;
            j++;
        }
        minLength = Math.min(minLength, j - i - 1);
        leftCounts[s[i]]--;
        i--;
    }

    return minLength;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. We count characters in `O(n)` and use the two-pointer technique in `O(n)` as well.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)`, as we only use constant extra space for counting characters and maintaining state.
