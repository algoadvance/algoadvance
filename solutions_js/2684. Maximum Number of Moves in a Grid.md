[Leetcode 2684. Maximum Number of Moves in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2684)
### Problem Statement
In this problem, you are given a grid of integers. Your task is to determine the maximum number of moves you can make starting from any cell in the grid and traveling either horizontally or vertically. Each move you make must take you to a cell with an integer greater than the integer in the current cell. The maximum number of moves is the longest sequence of such cells that you can find in the grid.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the grid square (N x N) or rectangular (M x N)?**
   - The grid can be any M x N rectangular grid.
   
2. **Can we revisit cells?**
   - No, each cell can be visited only once in a specific path.

3. **Are negative values allowed in the grid?**
   - Yes, the grid may contain negative values.

4. **What should be the output if the grid is empty?**
   - If the grid is empty, the output should be zero.

### Strategy
To solve this task, we can use Depth-First Search (DFS) with memoization (Dynamic Programming) to avoid recalculating results for cells we've already processed:
1. **DFS Starting from Each Cell**: Perform DFS from each cell while adhering to the condition that we can only move to cells with greater values.
2. **Memoization**: Store the result of the maximum moves starting from each cell to avoid repeated calculations.
3. **Direction Vectors**: Use direction vectors to explore adjacent cells in four possible movements (up, down, left, right).

### Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} grid
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxMoves = function(grid) {
    if (!grid || grid.length === 0 || grid[0].length === 0) return 0;
    
    const rows = grid.length;
    const cols = grid[0].length;
    const memo = Array.from({ length: rows }, () => Array(cols).fill(-1));
    const directions = [
        [0, 1],  // right
        [0, -1], // left
        [1, 0],  // down
        [-1, 0]  // up
    ];

    const dfs = (r, c) => {
        if (memo[r][c] !== -1) return memo[r][c];
        
        let maxLength = 0;

        for (const [dr, dc] of directions) {
            const nr = r + dr;
            const nc = c + dc;
            if (nr >= 0 && nr < rows && nc >= 0 && nc < cols && grid[nr][nc] > grid[r][c]) {
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, 1 + dfs(nr, nc));
            }
        }

        memo[r][c] = maxLength;
        return maxLength;
    }

    let result = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            result = Math.max(result, dfs(i, j));
        }
    }

    return result;
};

// Example:
// Input: grid = [[3,4,5],[3,2,6],[2,2,1]]
// Output: 4 (one of the longest paths is: 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6)
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(M * N), where M is the number of rows and N is the number of columns.
  - Each cell is visited once and memoized, resulting in O(1) operations per cell during traversal.
- **Space Complexity**: O(M * N)
  - Due to the memoization array and function call stack in DFS.
