[Leetcode 2364. Count Number of Bad Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2364)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. A pair `(i, j)` is called a **bad pair** if:

- `i < j` and
- `j - i != nums[j] - nums[i]`

Return the total number of bad pairs in the array.

### Example:
1. Input: `nums = [4,1,3,3]`
   Output: `5`
   
   Explanation:
   There are 5 bad pairs:
   - (0, 1): 1 - 0 != 1 - 4
   - (0, 2): 2 - 0 != 3 - 4
   - (0, 3): 3 - 0 != 3 - 4
   - (1, 2): 2 - 1 != 3 - 1
   - (1, 3): 3 - 1 != 3 - 1

2. Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`
   Output: `0`
   
   Explanation:
   There are no bad pairs.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can `nums` contain negative integers?
2. What is the largest possible size for `nums`?
3. Can `nums` contain duplicate values?
4. Are there any constraints on the values in `nums`?

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we need to leverage a better approach rather than checking every possible pair `(i, j)` which would result in a time complexity of \(O(n^2)\).

1. **Transform the Problem:** Notice that the condition `j - i != nums[j] - nums[i]` can be rewritten as `j - nums[j] != i - nums[i]`. If we define a new array `diff` where `diff[i] = i - nums[i]`, then a bad pair corresponds to indices `(i, j)` where `diff[i]` does not equal `diff[j]`.
  
2. **Count Good Pairs:** By counting the number of good pairs `(i, j)` where `diff[i] == diff[j]`, we can subtract this number from the total possible pairs to get the number of bad pairs.

3. **Use a Hash Map:** Use a hash map to store the frequency of each value of `diff[i]`. For each index `i` while traversing the array, calculate `diff[i]` and check how many times `diff[i]` has appeared before to count good pairs up to that index.

4. **Calculate Bad Pairs:** The total number of pairs is `n * (n - 1) / 2`, where `n` is the length of the array. Subtract the count of good pairs from the total pairs to get the result.

## Code

```javascript
var countBadPairs = function(nums) {
    let n = nums.length;
    let diffMap = new Map();
    let goodPairs = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let diff = i - nums[i];
        if (diffMap.has(diff)) {
            goodPairs += diffMap.get(diff);
            diffMap.set(diff, diffMap.get(diff) + 1);
        } else {
            diffMap.set(diff, 1);
        }
    }

    let totalPairs = n * (n - 1) / 2;
    return totalPairs - goodPairs;
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the `nums` array, since we traverse the array a few times with constant time operations.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), for the hash map to store the frequency of `diff` values.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count and calculate the number of bad pairs without resorting to the inefficient \(O(n^2)\) approach.
