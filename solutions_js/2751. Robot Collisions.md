[Leetcode 2751. Robot Collisions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2751)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of initial positions and directions of robots moving along an infinite line. The robots are initially positioned at unique coordinates. When two robots collide, they both disappear. Your task is to determine the final positions of the robots after all collisions have occurred.

- Each robot can move either to the left ('L') or to the right ('R').
- A collision happens when two robots meet at the same position.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: positions = [6, 2, 4], directions = ['R', 'L', 'L']
Output: [4]
Explanation:
- Robots at positions 2 and 4, both moving to the left, don't collide with each other or any other robot.
- Robot at position 6 moving right encounters no other robot and continues infinitely.
Thus, the only robot remaining is the one at position 4.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Clarifications on Input:**
   - Are the directions continuously 'R' or 'L' without any pause?
     - Yes, robots move continuously without stopping.
   - Can the input arrays be empty?
     - No, you can assume that positions and directions will have at least one robot.

2. **Output Specification:**
   - Should the output positions be sorted in any specific order?
     - No specific order is required, just return the positions of the remaining robots.

3. **Collision Rules:**
   - When two robots collide, do both disappear or does one prevail?
     - Both robots disappear upon collision.

### Strategy

The strategy involves simulating the collision process:

1. **Sorting Robots by Initial Positions:**
   - Start by sorting robots based on their initial positions.

2. **Using a Stack to Track Movements:**
   - Use a stack to monitor the robots moving to the right.
   - Every time a robot moving to the left encounters a robot moving to the right from the stack, a collision occurs, and both robots are removed.

3. **Tracking Non-colliding Robots:**
   - Robots moving to the left with no collisions directly get added to the results.
   - "Survivors" in the stack are robots moving to the right that did not collide.

4. **Merge Remaining Robots:**
   - Add all the remaining robots that did not collide back to the final list.

### Code

```javascript
function robotCollisions(positions, directions) {
    const robots = positions.map((position, index) => ({
        position,
        direction: directions[index]
    }));

    // Sort robots by their starting positions
    robots.sort((a, b) => a.position - b.position);

    const stack = [];
    const result = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < robots.length; i++) {
        const current = robots[i];
        
        if (current.direction === 'R') {
            stack.push(current);
        } else {
            // Handle collisions
            while (stack.length && stack[stack.length - 1].direction === 'R') {
                const top = stack.pop();
                // Robots collide and disappear
                current.disappear = true;
                top.disappear = true;
            }
            if (!current.disappear) {
                result.push(current);
            }
        }
    }

    // Add remaining right-moving robots to the results
    while (stack.length) {
        result.push(stack.pop());
    }

    // Extract positions of remaining robots
    return result.map(robot => robot.position);
}

// Example usage:
let positions = [6, 2, 4];
let directions = ['R', 'L', 'L'];
console.log(robotCollisions(positions, directions));  // Output: [4]
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n \log n)\):
- Sorting the robots by position takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- The single scan through the robots to simulate collisions is \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of robots.
