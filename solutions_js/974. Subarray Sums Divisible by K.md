[Leetcode 974. Subarray Sums Divisible by K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l974)
## Problem Statement
Given an array `nums` of integers and an integer `k`, return the number of contiguous subarrays that sum to a multiple of `k`.

### Example:
```
Input: nums = [4,5,0,-2,-3,1], k = 5
Output: 7
Explanation: There are 7 subarrays whose sums are divisible by k = 5:
              [4, 5, 0, -2, -3, 1], [5], [5, 0], [0], [0, -2, -3], [-2, -3], [0, -2, -3, 1]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are all elements in the array integers?
2. Can the array contain negative numbers?
3. Is there any upper limit on the size of the array?

## Strategy
1. **Prefix Sum and Remainders**: Use prefix sums and a hashmap to record the frequency of each remainder when divided by `k`. The key insight is that if there are subarrays with the same remainder, their difference will be divisible by `k`.
2. **HashMap Approach**: 
    - Start with a hashmap initialized with `{0: 1}` to count the prefix sum starting at index 0.
    - Traverse through the array, maintaining a running sum and calculating the current remainder modulo `k`.
    - If the remainder is seen before, add its frequency to the result because it indicates that there are subarrays ending at the current index that have sums divisible by `k`.
    - Update the hashmap with the current remainderâ€™s frequency.

## Code
```javascript
var subarraysDivByK = function(nums, k) {
    let count = 0;
    let sum = 0;
    let remainderFreq = {0: 1};

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        sum += nums[i];
        let remainder = ((sum % k) + k) % k; // normalize remainder

        if (remainder in remainderFreq) {
            count += remainderFreq[remainder];
        }

        if (remainder in remainderFreq) {
            remainderFreq[remainder]++;
        } else {
            remainderFreq[remainder] = 1;
        }
    }

    return count;
};
```
## Time Complexity
1. **Time Complexity**: O(n). The algorithm traverses the array once, and accessing and updating a hash map are O(1) operations on average.
2. **Space Complexity**: O(min(n, k)). The hashmap stores at most k different remainders, or n in the very worst case if all remainders are unique.

This solution efficiently finds the number of subarrays with sums divisible by `k` using the prefix sum and hashmap-based approach.
