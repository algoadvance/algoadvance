[Leetcode 1513. Number of Substrings With Only 1s](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1513)
### Problem Statement
You are given a binary string `s` (a string containing only characters '0' and '1'). Return the number of substrings with all characters '1'.

Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input format**: Is the input strictly a binary string?
    - Yes, the input is a string containing only '0's and '1's.
  
2. **Length of string**: Is there a maximum length for the string?
    - Typical constraints for such problems assume the length could be up to 10^5.

3. **Output format**: Should anything be considered other than the number of substrings?
    - No, just return the number of substrings containing only '1's.

### Strategy
The core idea is to count contiguous segments of '1's in the string and then compute the number of substrings that can be formed from each contiguous segment.

For instance, if there is a segment of length `n` of consecutive '1's, the number of substrings that can be formed from this segment is the sum of the first `n` natural numbers, which is given by:
\[ \text{Number of substrings} = \frac{n \times (n + 1)}{2} \]

#### Steps:
1. Initialize a counter for the number of '1's and a result variable.
2. Traverse the string:
   - If the character is '1', increase the counter.
   - If the character is '0':
     - If the counter is non-zero (meaning the end of a segment of '1's):
       - Calculate the substrings for the segment.
       - Reset the counter.
3. If there is a remaining segment after the loop ends, calculate its substrings as well.
4. Return the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Code Implementation
Hereâ€™s a possible JavaScript implementation that follows the above strategy:

```javascript
var numSub = function(s) {
    const MODULO = 10**9 + 7;
    let count = 0, result = 0;
    
    for (let char of s) {
        if (char === '1') {
            count++;
        } else {
            if (count > 0) {
                result += (count * (count + 1)) / 2;
                result %= MODULO;
                count = 0;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Handle last segment of '1's if any
    if (count > 0) {
        result += (count * (count + 1)) / 2;
        result %= MODULO;
    }
    
    return result;
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string. We make one pass through the string.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a fixed amount of extra space irrespective of the input size.

This approach ensures we efficiently count and calculate the number of valid substrings in linear time.
