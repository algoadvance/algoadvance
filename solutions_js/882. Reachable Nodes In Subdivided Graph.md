[Leetcode 882. Reachable Nodes In Subdivided Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l882)
### Problem Statement

You are given an undirected graph (with positive weights) represented by a list of edges. Each edge is represented as a tuple of three integers `(u, v, cnt)` where:

- `u` and `v` are the nodes connected by this edge.
- `cnt` is the number of new nodes on the edge which are not part of the original graph (excluding `u` and `v`).

The graph can be visualized by subdividing each edge into `cnt + 1` segments (including the starting and ending node), which results in additional `cnt` new nodes for that edge.

Given `maxMoves`, which represents the maximum number of moves you can make, and `n`, which represents the number of nodes initially present in the graph, return the number of nodes you can reach.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can nodes be visited multiple times?** 
   - Yes, nodes can be visited multiple times, but each visit will consume moves.
   
2. **Do we need to consider the direction of travel on edges?**
   - No, it’s an undirected graph.

3. **What is the maximum size of `maxMoves` and `n`?**
   - The constraints are reasonable, and we will ensure our solution is efficient within these limits.

### Strategy

The key strategy here involves using a prioritized traversal approach (similar to Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest paths) to determine the maximum reachability within the allowed number of moves.

1. **Graph Representation:** Represent the graph using an adjacency list where each node points to its neighbors and the number of new nodes in between.

2. **Priority Queue:** Use a priority queue (min-heap) to explore nodes in order of increasing distance from the start, limiting the traversal to the given `maxMoves`.

3. **Tracking Reachability:** Maintain a count of reachable original nodes and the new nodes added by each subdivided edge.

4. **Detailed Traversal:** Update traverse distance and reachable count dynamically based on edge weights and available moves.

### Code

```javascript
var reachableNodes = function(edges, maxMoves, n) {
    let graph = new Map();
    
    for (let [u, v, cnt] of edges) {
        if (!graph.has(u)) graph.set(u, new Map());
        if (!graph.has(v)) graph.set(v, new Map());
        graph.get(u).set(v, cnt);
        graph.get(v).set(u, cnt);
    }
    
    let pq = new MinPriorityQueue({ priority: x => x[1] });
    pq.enqueue([0, 0]); // [node, moves used]
    
    let visited = new Map(); // Maps node to moves used to reach it
    let totalReachable = 0;
    
    while (pq.size() > 0) {
        let [node, moves] = pq.dequeue().element;
        
        if (visited.has(node)) continue;
        visited.set(node, moves);
        
        // Count this node as reachable
        totalReachable++;
        
        for (let [nei, cnt] of (graph.get(node) || [])) {
            let nextMoves = moves + cnt + 1;
            
            if (nextMoves <= maxMoves) {
                if (!visited.has(nei)) {
                    pq.enqueue([nei, nextMoves]);
                }
            }
            
            let remainingMoves = maxMoves - moves;
            if (remainingMoves > 0) {
                let usedEdges = Math.min(cnt, remainingMoves);
                edgesReachable.set([node, nei].sort().toString(), (edgesReachable.get([node, nei].sort().toString()) || 0) + usedEdges);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Calculate new node reaches on the edges based on `edgesReachable`
    for (let [u, v, cnt] of edges) {
        let u_v_reachable = edgesReachable.get([u, v].sort().toString()) || 0;
        totalReachable += u_v_reachable;
    }
    
    return totalReachable;
    
    // Helper to create edge reachability map
    function edgeHash(u, v) {
        return [u, v].sort().toString();
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The algorithm primarily involves Dijkstra’s approach with a priority queue, running in `O(E + n log n)` where `E` is the number of edges and `n` is the number of nodes.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is `O(n + E)` to store the graph and priority queue.
