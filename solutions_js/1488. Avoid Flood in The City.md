[Leetcode 1488. Avoid Flood in The City](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1488)
## Problem Statement

The problem "1488. Avoid Flood in The City" is as follows:

Your city is experiencing heavy rainfall, and there are several lakes in the area. Each day, rain falls over a lake, one lake per day. If the same lake receives rain twice without being emptied, it will flood. However, the city can use dry days to empty any lake. Given an array `rains` where:
- `rains[i] > 0` means that rain falls over the lake `rains[i]`.
- `rains[i] == 0` means that it is a dry day and no lake is being rained on.

Return an array `result`:
- `result.length == rains.length`
- If `rains[i] > 0`, then `result[i] == -1`.
- If `rains[i] == 0`, then `result[i]` should be the lake you decide to dry on day `i`, or 1 if it is not possible to prevent a flood.

If it is impossible to prevent all lakes from flooding, return an empty array.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can a lake be dried on a day if there was no rain on that lake recently?
   - Yes, if it is a dry day, you are free to choose which lake to dry.
2. Is there any priority on which lake to dry if multiple lakes are set to flood?
   - We should prioritize drying the lake that will be rained upon the soonest in the future.
3. Can there be more dry days (`0`s in the `rains` array) than necessary?
   - Yes, and in such scenarios, we can simply choose to do nothing or dry an arbitrary lake.

## Strategy

1. **Track Rainy Days:** Use a map to record the last occurrence of rain on each lake.
2. **Use a Min-Heap for Dry Days:** Use a min-heap (priority queue) to track the lakes that need to be dried next.
3. **Iterate Over Days:** Process each day in the `rains` array:
   - If it's a rainy day (`rains[i] > 0`):
     1. Check if the lake has rained before and not been dried yet.
     2. If it has, the city will floodâ€”return an empty array.
     3. Otherwise, record the lake and add the lake to the min-heap.
   - If it's a dry day (`rains[i] == 0`):
     1. Use the min-heap to determine which lake to dry next.
     2. Record this lake in the result array.
     3. If no drying operation is needed, record 1 or perform no operation accordingly.

## Code

```javascript
var avoidFlood = function(rains) {
    const n = rains.length;
    const result = Array(n).fill(1); // Default to 1 for dry days unless specified otherwise
    const lakeMap = new Map();
    const heap = []; // Min-heap for tracking priority of drying lakes

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (rains[i] > 0) {
            const lake = rains[i];
            if (lakeMap.has(lake)) {
                const prevRainDay = lakeMap.get(lake);
                const dryDayIndex = heap.findIndex(day => result[day] === lake);
                if (dryDayIndex === -1) {
                    return [];
                }
                heap.splice(dryDayIndex, 1); // Remove the used dry day
                result[dryDayIndex] = lake; // Specify which lake to dry
            }
            result[i] = -1; // Rainy day, lake gets rained on
            lakeMap.set(lake, i);
        } else {
            // Dry day
            heap.push(i);
        }
    }

    for (let dryDay of heap) {
        result[dryDay] = 1;
    }

    return result;
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is **O(n^2)** in the worst case, as using an array to manage the heap involves linear time search and removal operations. This could be optimized with a more efficient data structure like a balanced binary search tree or using a more sophisticated heap approach to achieve **O(n log n)** complexity.
