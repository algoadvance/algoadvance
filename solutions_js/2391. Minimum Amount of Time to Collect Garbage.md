[Leetcode 2391. Minimum Amount of Time to Collect Garbage](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2391)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `garbage` where `garbage[i]` represents the types of garbage at the `i`-th house. `garbage[i][j]` is a character representing the type of garbage. You are also given an array `travel` where `travel[i]` is the travel time to get from the `i`-th house to the `i+1`-th house.

The garbage truck has to pick up three types of garbage, 'M' (Metal), 'P' (Paper), and 'G' (Glass). It takes 1 minute to pick up each piece of garbage no matter its type. The trucks start at house 0 and travel in a straight line to house `n-1`, picking up garbage beginning at house 0 until house `n-1`.

Return the minimum amount of time needed to pick up all the garbage.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are we given any assumptions about the non-negative nature of the travel times?
   - Yes, travel times are non-negative.
2. Can there be multiple types of garbage at one house?
   - Yes, each house can have multiple types of garbage.
3. Are the arrays `garbage` and `travel` guaranteed to be non-empty?
   - Yes, they are non-empty and `garbage` length is `n`, and `travel` length is `n-1`.

### Strategy

1. **Collect Count of Garbage**: Traverse the `garbage` array to count the total number of pieces of each type of garbage ('M', 'P', 'G').
2. **Determine Last Index for Each Truck**: Find the indices of the last house where each type of garbage ('M', 'P', 'G') is located.
3. **Calculate Travel Times**: For each type of garbage truck, accumulate the travel times required to reach its respective last index.
4. **Total Time Calculation**: Sum the total garbage count (in minutes) and the accumulated travel times for each truck.

### Time Complexity

- The solution requires two pass traversal of the `garbage` array and one pass traversal of the `travel` array.
- Thus, the time complexity is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of houses.

### Code

```javascript
function minTimeToCollectGarbage(garbage, travel) {
    const garbageCount = { 'M': 0, 'P': 0, 'G': 0 };
    const lastOccurrence = { 'M': -1, 'P': -1, 'G': -1 };
    
    // Count garbage and find last occurrence of each type.
    for (let i = 0; i < garbage.length; i++) {
        for (const type of garbage[i]) {
            garbageCount[type]++;
            lastOccurrence[type] = i;
        }
    }
    
    // Calculate travel times to the last occurrence for each type of garbage truck.
    let totalTravelTime = { 'M': 0, 'P': 0, 'G': 0 };
    
    for (const type of ['M', 'P', 'G']) {
        let lastIdx = lastOccurrence[type];
        for (let i = 0; i < lastIdx; i++) {
            totalTravelTime[type] += travel[i];
        }
    }
    
    // Total time is the sum of travel times and garbage collection times.
    let totalTime = garbageCount['M'] + garbageCount['P'] + garbageCount['G'];
    totalTime += totalTravelTime['M'] + totalTravelTime['P'] + totalTravelTime['G'];
    
    return totalTime;
}

// Example
const garbage = ["G", "P", "GP", "GG"];
const travel = [2, 4, 3];
console.log(minTimeToCollectGarbage(garbage, travel)); // Output: 21
```

In this solution:
- We first count the amount of each type of garbage and note the last house where each type occurs.
- Then we calculate the travel time needed for each truck to travel up to its last required house.
- Finally, we combine the travel times and the time to pick up all pieces of garbage to get the total minimum time.
