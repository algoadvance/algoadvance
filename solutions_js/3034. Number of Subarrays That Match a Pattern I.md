[Leetcode 3034. Number of Subarrays That Match a Pattern I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3034)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays, `arr` and `pattern`, of the same length. You want to find the number of subarrays of `arr` that match the `pattern`. A subarray matches the pattern if the difference between each pair of consecutive elements in `arr` is the same as the difference between each pair of consecutive elements in `pattern`.

Formally, `subarray` of length `k` starting from index `i` matches the pattern if for every `j` in the range [0, k-2]:

`arr[i + j + 1] - arr[i + j] == pattern[j + 1] - pattern[j]`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array elements be negative?** 
   - Yes, arrays can contain negative numbers.
   
2. **What is the maximum length for `arr` and `pattern`?**
   - Usually, there might be a constraint, but for now, letâ€™s assume large lengths, focus on the logic and try to achieve the optimal solution. 

3. **Should we always assume the `arr` and `pattern` lengths are the same?**
   - Yes, the problem statement mentions they are of the same length.

### Strategy

1. **Calculate the difference array for both `arr` and `pattern`**:
   - Create two difference arrays: one for `arr` and one for `pattern`.
   - For example, if `arr = [1, 3, 5]`, the difference array would be `[2, 2]` since `3 - 1 = 2` and `5 - 3 = 2`.
   
2. **Match subarrays**:
   - Compare each subarray of the difference array of `arr` with the difference array of `pattern`.
   
3. **Sliding Window**:
   - Use a sliding window approach on the difference array of `arr` to improve efficiency.

### Code

```javascript
function numberOfMatchingSubarrays(arr, pattern) {
    if (arr.length !== pattern.length) return 0;
    const n = arr.length;
    
    // Calculate the difference arrays
    const arrDiff = [];
    const patternDiff = [];
    
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        arrDiff.push(arr[i] - arr[i-1]);
        patternDiff.push(pattern[i] - pattern[i-1]);
    }
    
    let count = 0, k = patternDiff.length;
    
    // Sliding window approach to match subarrays of arrDiff with patternDiff
    for (let i = 0; i <= arrDiff.length - k; i++) {
        let match = true;
        for (let j = 0; j < k; j++) {
            if (arrDiff[i + j] !== patternDiff[j]) {
                match = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (match) count++;
    }
    
    return count;
}

// Example Usage:
const arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9];
const pattern = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];
console.log(numberOfMatchingSubarrays(arr, pattern)); // Output will depend on the arrays.
```

### Time Complexity

- **Difference Array Calculation**: This loop runs in O(n) for both `arr` and `pattern`.
- **Sliding Window Subarray Match**: This nested loop also runs in O(n). The outer loop runs `n - k + 1` times and the inner loop runs `k` times. Since `k` is also related to `n`, the overall time complexity of this step is also O(n).

Hence, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.

This is efficient and should work well for reasonably large input sizes.
