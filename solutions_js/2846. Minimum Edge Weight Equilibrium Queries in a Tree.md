[Leetcode 2846. Minimum Edge Weight Equilibrium Queries in a Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2846)
## Problem Statement

You are given an tree represented by an integer `n` as the number of nodes from `0` to `n-1`, and an integer array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [ui, vi, w_i]` denotes that there's an edge between `ui` and `vi` with a weight `wi`. You are also given an integer array `queries` where `queries[i] = [a_j, b_j, limit_j]` where `a_j` and `b_j` are two nodes, and `limit_j` is the maximum limit allowed for the maximum edge weight along the path from `a_j` to `b_j`.

For each query, return true if there is a path from `a_j` to `b_j` such that the maximum edge weight on that path is less than `limit_j`, otherwise return false.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:** What are the constraints on the size of the input (number of nodes, number of edges, and number of queries)?
2. **Graph Properties:** Are the node values and edge weights guaranteed to be integers and non-negative?
3. **Unique Edges:** Are multiple edges between two nodes allowed, or is it guaranteed that there is at most one edge between any two nodes?
4. **Cycle Verification:** Since it's a tree, it means there are no cycles, is that right?

## Strategy

Given that this is a tree and we need to efficiently answer queries about path constraints, the optimal strategy would involve:
1. **Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and Binary Lifting:**
   - We can use the properties of a tree to preprocess the tree such that we can answer maximum edge weight queries efficiently.
   - Using Binary Lifting technique with Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) method might be helpful to preprocess the tree so that we can quickly find the maximum edge weight in the path between any two nodes.
   
2. **Preprocessing LCA and Max Edge Weights with Binary Lifting:**
   - Preprocess LCA for each node.
   - Maintain the maximum edge weight information for each node during the traversal to enable efficient querying.

3. **DFS for Distance Calculation:**
   - Use Depth First Search (DFS) to calculate path information and store parent and maximum edge weight values at each level.

## Code

Here's the implementation of the preprocessing and querying using a combination of DFS and Binary Lifting:

```javascript
class TreeQuery {
    constructor(n, edges) {
        this.n = n;
        this.edges = edges;
        this.graph = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
        this.LCA = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(18).fill(-1)); // Binary lifting for up to 2^17 nodes
        this.maxEdge = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(18).fill(0));
        this.depth = Array(n).fill(0);

        // Build the graph
        for (let [u, v, w] of edges) {
            this.graph[u].push([v, w]);
            this.graph[v].push([u, w]);
        }
        
        // Initial DFS to populate depth, LCA, and maxEdge tables
        this.dfs(0, -1, 0, 0);
        // Precompute LCA and maxEdge values
        this.precompute();
    }

    dfs(node, parent, d, maxW) {
        this.LCA[node][0] = parent;
        this.maxEdge[node][0] = maxW;
        this.depth[node] = d;

        for (let [neigh, weight] of this.graph[node]) {
            if (neigh !== parent) {
                this.dfs(neigh, node, d + 1, weight);
            }
        }
    }

    precompute() {
        for (let j = 1; j < 18; j++) {
            for (let i = 0; i < this.n; i++) {
                if (this.LCA[i][j - 1] !== -1) {
                    this.LCA[i][j] = this.LCA[i][j - 1];
                    this.LCA[i][j] = this.LCA[this.LCA[i][j - 1]][j - 1];
                    this.maxEdge[i][j] = Math.max(this.maxEdge[i][j - 1], this.maxEdge[this.LCA[i][j - 1]][j - 1]);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    query(a, b, limit) {
        if (this.depth[a] < this.depth[b]) [a, b] = [b, a];

        let maxW = 0;
        let diff = this.depth[a] - this.depth[b];

        for (let j = 17; j >= 0; j--) {
            if ((diff >> j) & 1) {
                maxW = Math.max(maxW, this.maxEdge[a][j]);
                a = this.LCA[a][j];
            }
        }

        if (a === b) return maxW < limit;

        for (let j = 17; j >= 0; j--) {
            if (this.LCA[a][j] !== this.LCA[b][j]) {
                maxW = Math.max(maxW, this.maxEdge[a][j], this.maxEdge[b][j]);
                a = this.LCA[a][j];
                b = this.LCA[b][j];
            }
        }

        maxW = Math.max(maxW, this.maxEdge[a][0], this.maxEdge[b][0]);
        return maxW < limit;
    }
}

// Example usage:
let n = 6;
let edges = [
    [0, 1, 1],
    [1, 2, 2],
    [1, 3, 3],
    [2, 4, 4],
    [3, 5, 5]
];
let queries = [
    [3, 4, 6],
    [4, 5, 5],
    [1, 2, 2]
];

let treeQuery = new TreeQuery(n, edges);
let results = queries.map(([a, b, limit]) => treeQuery.query(a, b, limit));
console.log(results); // [true, false, false]
```

## Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing Time:** `O(n log n)` to build the graph, run DFS, and precompute the LCA and maximum edge weights.
- **Query Time:** Each query would be `O(log n)` due to the binary lifting technique.

This approach ensures efficient preprocessing and querying suitable for large trees and numerous queries.
