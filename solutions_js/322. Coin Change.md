[Leetcode 322. Coin Change](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l322)
### Problem Statement

The problem asks you to determine the fewest number of coins needed to make up a given amount of money. Assume you have an array of different denominations of coins, and you would like to use as few coins as possible to make up the given amount. If it is impossible to make up the amount with the given coins, the function should return -1. 

#### Example:
- **Input:** `coins = [1, 2, 5]`, `amount = 11`
- **Output:** `3` 
  - Explanation: 11 can be made with 5 + 5 + 1 (3 coins).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the input `coins` array be empty or null?
   - **A:** No, the `coins` array will have at least one coin denomination.

2. **Q:** Can the `amount` be zero?
   - **A:** Yes, if `amount` is zero, the fewest number of coins needed is 0.

3. **Q:** Are the coin denominations always positive integers?
   - **A:** Yes, the coin denominations will always be positive integers.

4. **Q:** What should be the output if no combination can form the given `amount`?
   - **A:** The function should return `-1`.

### Strategy

We can approach this problem using Dynamic Programming (DP). The idea is to build a table `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of coins needed to make up the amount `i`.

#### Steps:
1. Initialize a `dp` array with a size of `amount + 1` and set all values to `Infinity`, except `dp[0]` which should be `0` because no coins are needed to make up an amount of `0`.
2. Iterate over each coin and update the `dp` array for each possible amount that can be achieved by adding the current coin to the sub-problems already solved.
3. After filling up the `dp` array, `dp[amount]` will hold the minimum number of coins needed for the `amount` if it can be achieved; otherwise, it will remain `Infinity`.
4. Return the value of `dp[amount]` if it is not `Infinity`; otherwise, return `-1`.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n * m), where `n` is the number of coins, and `m` is the `amount`.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m), where `m` is the `amount`.

### Code
```javascript
function coinChange(coins, amount) {
    // Initialize dp array with Infinity, and set dp[0] = 0
    let dp = new Array(amount + 1).fill(Infinity);
    dp[0] = 0;
    
    // Iterate over each coin
    for (let coin of coins) {
        // Update dp array for each possible amount that can be achieved
        for (let i = coin; i <= amount; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
        }
    }
    
    // Return the result
    return dp[amount] === Infinity ? -1 : dp[amount];
}
 
// Example usage
console.log(coinChange([1, 2, 5], 11)); // Output: 3
console.log(coinChange([2], 3)); // Output: -1
console.log(coinChange([1], 0)); // Output: 0
```

This solution effectively uses dynamic programming to solve the problem by building up the solution for each amount from `0` to `amount` inclusively. The use of the `dp` array allows us to efficiently compute the minimum number of coins required.
