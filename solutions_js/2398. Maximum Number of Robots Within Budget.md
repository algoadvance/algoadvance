[Leetcode 2398. Maximum Number of Robots Within Budget](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2398)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays `chargeTimes` and `runningCosts`, and an integer `budget`. The `i-th` robot consumes `runningCosts[i]` units of resources per minute while it is running. The robot also requires a one-time `chargeTimes[i]` to start.

Your task is to determine the maximum number of consecutive robots that can run simultaneously without exceeding the given `budget`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the lengths of `chargeTimes` and `runningCosts`?**
   - Usually, array lengths can range from 1 to 10^5, but confirm if there are specific constraints for this problem.

2. **What is the range of values for the elements in `chargeTimes`, `runningCosts`, and `budget`?**
   - Typical value ranges are from 1 to 10^9 for these types of problems.

3. **Can the `budget` be zero or negative?**
   - Confirm if handling such cases is necessary or if they are out of scope.

### Strategy

Given the constraints and problem type, a sliding window approach paired with a data structure to manage the maximum value in a certain range would be effective.

1. **Sliding Window with Deque:**
   - Utilize a deque to maintain the maximum `chargeTimes` in the current window.
   - Scan through the arrays using two pointers (`start` and `end`) to maintain a sliding window.

2. **Calculate the total cost for the current window:**
   - The cost consists of the maximum `chargeTime` in the window + length of window * sum of `runningCosts`.

3. **Adjust Window:**
   - If the total cost exceeds the budget, increment the `start` pointer to shrink the window.

### Code

Here's the code implementing the above strategy:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} chargeTimes
 * @param {number[]} runningCosts
 * @param {number} budget
 * @return {number}
 */
var maximumRobots = function(chargeTimes, runningCosts, budget) {
    let maximumRobots = 0;
    let start = 0;
    let currentRunningCostSum = 0;
    let deque = []; // Used to keep track of the maximum chargeTimes in the current window

    for (let end = 0; end < chargeTimes.length; end++) {
        currentRunningCostSum += runningCosts[end];

        // Maintain the deque to keep track of the maximum charge time in the window
        while (deque.length > 0 && chargeTimes[deque[deque.length - 1]] <= chargeTimes[end]) {
            deque.pop();
        }
        deque.push(end);
        
        // Check the total cost, if it exceeds the budget, shrink the window from the left
        while (deque.length > 0 && chargeTimes[deque[0]] + (end - start + 1) * currentRunningCostSum > budget) {
            // Move start up
            currentRunningCostSum -= runningCosts[start];
            if (deque[0] === start) {
                deque.shift();
            }
            start++;
        }

        // Update the maximum number of robots that can be active
        maximumRobots = Math.max(maximumRobots, end - start + 1);
    }

    return maximumRobots;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sliding Window Adjustment:** Each element in `chargeTimes` and `runningCosts` is processed at most twice, once when added and once when removed from the window, making it O(n).
- **Maintenance of Deque:** Each element is added and removed from the deque at most once, making it O(n).

**Overall Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input arrays.

This efficient approach ensures that the solution operates within acceptable limits for large input sizes.
