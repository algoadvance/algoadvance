[Leetcode 126. Word Ladder II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l126)
## Problem Statement

Given two words `beginWord` and `endWord`, and a dictionary `wordList`, return all the shortest transformation sequences from `beginWord` to `endWord`, or an empty list if no such sequence exists. Each transformation must change exactly one letter, and each transformed word must exist in the `wordList`.

**Note:** 

- Return the sequences in any order.
- All words have the same length.
- All words contain only lowercase alphabetic characters.
- You may assume no duplicates in the `wordList`.
- You may assume `beginWord` and `endWord` are non-empty and are not the same.

### Example
```js
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]

Output:
[
  ["hit","hot","dot","dog","cog"],
  ["hit","hot","lot","log","cog"]
]
```

```js
beginWord = "hit"
endWord = "cog"
wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]

Output: []
```


## Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume that the start and end words are non-empty strings as given in the problem?
2. Can we assume that all words in the `wordList` are of the same length as `beginWord` and `endWord`?

Let's proceed with the problem assuming all above points.

## Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):** Use BFS to find the shortest path. BFS is easier for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph.
2. **Transformations**: For each word, try to transform each letter to any of 'a' to 'z' and see if the transformed word is in the word list and not visited.
3. **Backtracking**: Once we find the shortest path, we'll use backtracking to record all the paths.

## Code

```js
var findLadders = function(beginWord, endWord, wordList) {
    const wordSet = new Set(wordList);
    if (!wordSet.has(endWord)) return [];
    
    let layer = {};
    layer[beginWord] = [[beginWord]]; // initial layer with beginWord

    while (layer) {
        const newLayer = {};
        for (let word of Object.keys(layer)) {
            if (word === endWord) {
                return layer[word]; // return all transformation paths ending with endWord
            }
            for (let i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
                for (let c = 97; c <= 122; c++) { // 97 to 122 are ASCII of 'a' to 'z'
                    const newWord = word.slice(0, i) + String.fromCharCode(c) + word.slice(i + 1);
                    if (wordSet.has(newWord)) {
                        if (!newLayer[newWord]) newLayer[newWord] = [];
                        newLayer[newWord].push(...layer[word].map(list => [...list, newWord]));
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        for (let word of Object.keys(newLayer)) {
            wordSet.delete(word); // delete from wordSet to avoid revisit
        }
        layer = newLayer;
    }
    
    return [];
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** In the worst case, we are converting every possible string of the same length as the `beginWord` and `endWord`, which is `26^L` where `L` is the length of the word. However, our BFS helps short-circuit many of these operations. The primary cost is examining each possible transformation which is `O(L*26)`, multiplied by the number of words in the wordList `N`. Therefore, the time complexity is typically about `O(N*L*26)`, but efficiencies within the BFS should reduce redundant work.
  
- **Space Complexity:** We need to store each path, as well as the transform layers, leading to a space complexity of `O(N)` for the data itself, but it scales with the number of possible paths stored in memory.
