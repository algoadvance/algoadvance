[Leetcode 2318. Number of Distinct Roll Sequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2318)
### Problem Statement

Consider a dice rolling game where you roll a 6-sided die. You're given `n` as the number of rolls. Each roll can result in any of the numbers from 1 to 6. You need to compute the number of distinct sequences of rolls of length `n` where no two consecutive dice rolls are the same.

Given an integer `n`, return the number of distinct sequences of dice rolls such that no two consecutive dice rolls are the same. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is `n` always a positive integer?** 
   * Yes, `n` is always a positive integer.
2. **Is there any limit or constraints on `n`?**
   * Yes, the constraint is usually within reasonable limits to avoid excessive computation. Typically `n` might be up to around 10^4 or 10^5.
3. **What is the modulo value to be used for the final answer?**
   * The modulo value should be 10^9 + 7.

### Strategy
The problem can be viewed as a dynamic programming problem where we track the number of valid sequences. Letâ€™s break down the approach:

1. **Understanding transitions**:
   - Let `dp[i][k]` represent the number of distinct sequences of length `i` that end with the k-th side of a die.
   - Initialize a 2D array `dp` of size `[n][6]` where `dp[i][k]` is the number of sequences of length `i+1` ending with the k-th number.

2. **Transitions**:
   - For each roll from 2 to `n`, we need to ensure that the current roll is not equal to the previous roll.
   - Transition formula: `dp[i][k] = sum(dp[i-1][j] for all j != k)`.

3. **Initial States**:
   - For the initial roll (i.e., `i = 0`), each face of the die contributes one sequence: `dp[0][k] = 1` for all `k` from 0 to 5.

4. **Modulo Operation**:
   - Since the answer could be very large, every addition/subtraction should be taken modulo `10^9 + 7`.

5. **Final Answer**:
   - Sum up all the counts in `dp[n-1]` to get the total number of valid sequences.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n \cdot 6^2)\). This considers each state transition involving 6 possible states for each of the `n` steps.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n \cdot 6)\), which can be optimized using space optimization techniques to just \(O(6)\).

### Code

Here's how you might implement this in JavaScript:

```javascript
const MOD = 10**9 + 7;

function numDistinctRollSequences(n) {
    if (n === 1) return 6;
    
    const dp = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(6).fill(0));

    // Initial state
    for (let i = 0; i < 6; i++) {
        dp[0][i] = 1;
    }

    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        for (let k = 0; k < 6; k++) {
            dp[i][k] = 0;
            for (let j = 0; j < 6; j++) {
                if (j !== k) {
                    dp[i][k] = (dp[i][k] + dp[i-1][j]) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Summing up the count of sequences of length n
    let result = 0;
    for (let k = 0; k < 6; k++) {
        result = (result + dp[n-1][k]) % MOD;
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(numDistinctRollSequences(2)); // Example output: 30
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**:
   - Each face of the die has 1 initial way to appear.
2. **Transition logic**:
   - For each length `i` and each possible dice face `k`, sum all valid previous states (ensuring no two consecutive faces are the same).
3. **Result Summation**:
   - Finally, sum up all the valid sequences of length `n` ending with any face and return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

This approach efficiently computes the number of valid sequences using dynamic programming.
