[Leetcode 391. Perfect Rectangle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l391)
## Problem Statement
Given an array of rectangles represented by `rectangles`, where `rectangles[i] = [x1, y1, x2, y2]` denotes a rectangle with its bottom-left corner `(x1, y1)` and top-right corner `(x2, y2)`, return `true` if they all form an exact cover of a rectangular region.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the coordinates always integers?**
   - Yes, they are always integers.

2. **Can the rectangles overlap?**
   - No, the rectangles cannot overlap. They should perfectly form a single large rectangle.

3. **Do the rectangles need to touch each other?**
   - The rectangles can touch each other, but they should not overlap and must exactly cover the given area.

4. **Is it guaranteed that the input list has at least one rectangle?**
   - Yes, there is at least one rectangle in the input list.

## Strategy
To determine if the rectangles form an exact cover of a rectangular region, we need to consider the following:
1. The area covered by the given rectangles should equal the area of the bounding rectangle which encompasses all the rectangles.
2. The corner points of the bounding rectangle must occur exactly once.
3. Any other points (other than corners of the bounding rectangle) should occur even number of times for the rectangles not to overlap.

### Steps:
1. Calculate the total area covered by all the rectangles.
2. Identify the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates to determine the bounding rectangle's corners.
3. Use a set to keep track of the appearance of each rectangle's corner.
4. Verify that the four corners of the bounding rectangle each appear exactly once.
5. Ensure that any other point appears an appropriate number of times.

Here's how you can implement it in JavaScript:

## Code
```javascript
function isRectangleCover(rectangles) {
    const pointSet = new Set();
    let totalArea = 0;
    let minX = Infinity, minY = Infinity, maxX = -Infinity, maxY = -Infinity;

    for (const [x1, y1, x2, y2] of rectangles) {
        const rectArea = (x2 - x1) * (y2 - y1);
        totalArea += rectArea;

        minX = Math.min(minX, x1);
        minY = Math.min(minY, y1);
        maxX = Math.max(maxX, x2);
        maxY = Math.max(maxY, y2);

        const points = [
            `${x1},${y1}`, `${x1},${y2}`, 
            `${x2},${y1}`, `${x2},${y2}`
        ];

        for (const point of points) {
            if (pointSet.has(point)) {
                pointSet.delete(point);
            } else {
                pointSet.add(point);
            }
        }
    }

    const boundingCorners = [
        `${minX},${minY}`, `${minX},${maxY}`, 
        `${maxX},${minY}`, `${maxX},${maxY}`
    ];

    for (const corner of boundingCorners) {
        if (!pointSet.has(corner)) {
            return false;
        }
        pointSet.delete(corner);
    }

    return pointSet.size === 0 && 
           totalArea === (maxX - minX) * (maxY - minY);
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of rectangles. This is because we iterate through each rectangle once to calculate areas and update point sets.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N) for storing points in the set.

This approach ensures that we both verify the area and check for exact coverage without overlaps or gaps.
