[Leetcode 3233. Find the Count of Numbers Which Are Not Special](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3233)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of non-negative integers `arr` and an integer `k`. A number is called "special-out" if it is a multiple of `k` or if its digit sum is a multiple of `k`. Write a function that returns the count of numbers in the array that are *not* "special-out".

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What constitutes a "digit sum"?**
   - The digit sum of a number is the sum of all its individual digits. For instance, the digit sum of 123 is 1+2+3=6.

2. **What should the function return if all elements in the array are "special-out"?**
   - In this case, the function should return 0.

3. **Can the input array be empty?**
   - If the input array is empty, the function should return 0, as there are no elements to consider.

4. **What are the constraints on `k` and the elements of the array?**
   - `k` is a non-negative integer, and all elements of the array are non-negative integers.

### Strategy

1. **Digit Sum Calculation**: Create a helper function to calculate the digit sum of a given number.
2. **Identify Special-out Numbers**: For each number in the array, check if it is divisible by `k` or if its digit sum is divisible by `k`.
3. **Count Non Special-out Numbers**: Maintain a count of numbers that do not satisfy either of the conditions mentioned above.

### Code

```javascript
function countNonSpecialOutNumbers(arr, k) {
    // Helper function to calculate digit sum
    function digitSum(num) {
        let sum = 0;
        while (num > 0) {
            sum += num % 10;
            num = Math.floor(num / 10);
        }
        return sum;
    }
    
    let count = 0;

    for (let num of arr) {
        // Check if the number is a "special-out" 
        if (num % k !== 0 && digitSum(num) % k !== 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    return count;
}

// Example usage:
const arr = [12, 45, 6, 7, 30];
const k = 3;
console.log(countNonSpecialOutNumbers(arr, k)); // Output: count of numbers which are NOT special-out
```

### Time Complexity

- **Digit Sum Calculation**: The time complexity for calculating the digit sum can be considered O(log10(N)), where N is the number whose digit sum is being calculated.
- **Total Time Complexity**: The total complexity would be O(n * log10(M)), where n is the number of elements in the array, and M is the maximum element in the array. This accounts for iterating through the array and calculating the digit sum for each element.

With this strategy and code, you should be able to determine the count of numbers in the array that are not "special-out".
