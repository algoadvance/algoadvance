[Leetcode 424. Longest Repeating Character Replacement](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l424)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You can choose any character of the string and change it to any other uppercase English character. You can perform this operation at most `k` times.

Return the length of the longest substring containing the same letter you can get after performing the above operations.

### Example

1. **Input:** `s = "ABAB", k = 2`
   **Output:** `4`
   **Explanation:** Replace the two 'A's with two 'B's or vice versa.

2. **Input:** `s = "AABABBA", k = 1`
   **Output:** `4`
   **Explanation:** Replace the one 'A' in the middle with 'B' to form "AABBBBA".

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What should be the format of the input?
   **A:** The input will be a string `s` consisting of uppercase English letters and an integer `k`.

2. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the string length?
   **A:** Yes, typically the constraints mention the length of the string `s` as being between 1 and 10^5, and `k` is a non-negative integer.

3. **Q:** What should be returned as the output?
   **A:** Return an integer representing the length of the longest substring that can be obtained.

## Strategy

1. **Use Sliding Window Technique:**
   - Use a sliding window with two pointers, `start` and `end`.
   - Maintain a count of the frequency of each character within the current window.
   - Calculate the max count of any single character in the current window.
   - If the length of the window minus the max count of the most frequent character is greater than `k`, move the `start` pointer to shrink the window.
   - Continue to update the maximum length of the window that can be converted to the same character.

2. **Steps in Detail:**
   - Initialize variables: `start` = 0, `maxCount` = 0, `maxLength` = 0, and an empty frequency map.
   - Iterate with an `end` pointer through the string.
   - Update the frequency map and the `maxCount`.
   - Check if the current window size minus `maxCount` exceeds `k`. If true, move the `start` pointer.
   - Update the `maxLength` with the maximum size of the valid window.

## Code 

```javascript
function characterReplacement(s, k) {
    let start = 0, maxCount = 0, maxLength = 0;
    let charFrequency = {};

    for (let end = 0; end < s.length; end++) {
        const endChar = s[end];
        charFrequency[endChar] = (charFrequency[endChar] || 0) + 1;
        maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, charFrequency[endChar]);

        while ((end - start + 1) - maxCount > k) {
            const startChar = s[start];
            charFrequency[startChar]--;
            start++;
        }

        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, end - start + 1);
    }

    return maxLength;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(characterReplacement("ABAB", 2)); // Output: 4
console.log(characterReplacement("AABABBA", 1)); // Output: 4
```

## Time Complexity

- **O(n)**: We are passing through the string with two pointers (start and end) at most once, thus the complexity is linear relative to the length of the string `n`.

This solution ensures that we efficiently find the longest substring by adjusting the window size dynamically based on the constraints given by `k`.
