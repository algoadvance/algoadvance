[Leetcode 2874. Maximum Value of an Ordered Triplet II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2874)
## Problem Statement
You are given an array of integers `nums`. You are asked to find the maximum value of the expression `nums[i] * nums[j] * nums[k]` where `0 <= i < j < k < nums.length`. Your task is to implement the function to find this maximum value.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the size range of the `nums` array?**
   - The array size can vary, ranging from very small to potentially very large, though there is no strict upper limit provided.

2. **Can there be negative numbers in the `nums` array?**
   - Yes, the array may contain negative numbers, which might affect the product's value.

3. **Are all values in the `nums` array distinct?**
   - There is no indication that the numbers are distinct, so duplicates may exist.

4. **Will the array always have at least 3 elements?**
   - Assuming it's a valid input for the problem, the array should have at least 3 elements.

## Strategy
To find the maximum value of the expression `nums[i] * nums[j] * nums[k]`:

1. **Sort the Array**: First, sort the `nums` array. This will allow easy access to the largest and smallest elements.
  
2. **Compare Candidate Products**: The maximum product of three numbers can be either:
    - The product of the three largest numbers in the array.
    - The product of the two smallest numbers (which might be negative) and the largest number (because negative * negative = positive).

3. **Select Maximum Value**: After calculating both candidate products, return the maximum of the two.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var maximumProduct = function(nums) {
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    const n = nums.length;
    const max1 = nums[n - 1] * nums[n - 2] * nums[n - 3];
    const max2 = nums[0] * nums[1] * nums[n - 1];
    return Math.max(max1, max2);
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting the Array**: The primary time complexity is determined by the sorting operation, which is `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the length of the `nums` array.
- **Calculating Products and Returning Maximum**: These operations are constant time, `O(1)`.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step.
