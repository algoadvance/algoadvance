[Leetcode 1227. Airplane Seat Assignment Probability](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1227)
### Problem Statement
1227. Airplane Seat Assignment Probability

There are `n` passengers ailing the airplane with exactly `n` seats. The first passenger has lost his ticket and picks a seat randomly, but all the rest of the passengers have their tickets and they will:

1. Take their own seat if it is available, and
2. Pick other seats randomly when they find their seat occupied.

Return the probability that the `n-th` person gets his own seat.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Does the first passenger always pick a seat randomly?
   - **A:** Yes.
  
2. **Q:** Do the remaining passengers always prefer their own seat if itâ€™s available?
   - **A:** Yes.

3. **Q:** Are the seats always indexed from 1 to `n`?
   - **A:** Yes.

4. **Q:** Do we need to consider multiple test cases?
   - **A:** The problem description seems to refer to a single instance with `n` seats.

### Strategy
The problem is a classic probability puzzle where the expected outcome is somewhat counterintuitive. We can prove via induction or simulation that the probability that the `n-th` person ends up in their own seat is always `0.5` for `n >= 2`.

#### Explanation:
1. **Base Case**:
    - For `n=1`, the seat taken will always be that of the `1st` person.
    - Probability = `1`.

2. **Inductive Proof**:
    - When `n >= 2`, if the first passenger randomly picks someone else's seat, the problem reduces to a smaller subproblem where the same argument holds.

3. **General Pattern**:
    - For `n >= 2`, through reasoning, you find that the chance always ends up being `0.5`.

Given this pattern, we can implement a straightforward function.

### Code
```javascript
function nthPersonGetsNthSeat(n) {
    // If there's only one passenger, they will sit in their seat, else it's always 0.5
    return n === 1 ? 1.0 : 0.5;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(1)` - The solution directly computes the result in constant time, independent of the input `n`.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` - The solution uses a constant amount of space.

This approach leverages the statistical insight of the problem, providing an optimal and efficient solution.
