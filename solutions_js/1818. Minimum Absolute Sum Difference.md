[Leetcode 1818. Minimum Absolute Sum Difference](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1818)
### Problem Statement

You are given two positive integer arrays nums1 and nums2, both of length n.

The absolute sum difference of arrays `nums1` and `nums2` is defined as the sum of `|nums1[i] - nums2[i]|` for each `0 <= i < n`.

You can replace at most one element of `nums1` with any other element in `nums1` to minimize the absolute sum difference.

Return the minimum absolute sum difference after replacing at most one element in `nums1`.

Since the answer may be large, return it modulo 10^9 + 7.

**Example:**

```
Input: nums1 = [1,7,5], nums2 = [2,3,5]
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three possible replacements, yielding the resulst:
(1,7,5) -> (1,7,5), abs sum diff = |1-2| + |7-3| + |5-5| = 1+4+0 = 5
(1,7,5) -> (2,7,5), abs sum diff = |2-2| + |7-3| + |5-5| = 0+4+0 = 4
(1,7,5) -> (1,3,5), abs sum diff = |1-2| + |3-3| + |5-5| = 1+0+0 = 1
The minimum is 1.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the arrays guaranteed to be of the same length?  
   Yes, both arrays are of length `n`.

2. What should be done if there are multiple replacements producing the same minimal result?  
   Any one of such replacements is acceptable.

3. How large can the elements of the arrays be?  
   The elements of arrays `nums1` and `nums2` are positive integers but their upper limit is not specified. You should assume the worst-case scenario when considering the complexity of your solution.

4. Should the difference always be in modulo 10^9 + 7?  
   Yes, return the result modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Calculation:** First, compute the current absolute sum difference without any replacements.

2. **Replacement Effect:** For each element in `nums1`, calculate the effect of replacing it with every other element in `nums1` and evaluate the absolute sum difference.

3. **Optimization Using Binary Search:** Since checking every potential replacement naively would be too slow (O(n^2)), sort `nums1` and use a binary search to find the best replacement for each element in `nums2` efficiently (O(n log n)).

### Code

```javascript
function minAbsoluteSumDiff(nums1, nums2) {
    const MOD = 10**9 + 7;
    const n = nums1.length;

    // Helper function for binary search
    function binarySearch(arr, target) {
        let left = 0;
        let right = arr.length - 1;
        while (left <= right) {
            const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
            if (arr[mid] === target) return mid;
            else if (arr[mid] < target) left = mid + 1;
            else right = mid - 1;
        }
        return left;
    }

    let totalDiff = 0;
    const diffs = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const diff = Math.abs(nums1[i] - nums2[i]);
        totalDiff += diff;
        totalDiff %= MOD;
        diffs.push(diff);
    }
    
    const sortedNums1 = [...nums1].sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let maxReduction = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const num2 = nums2[i];
        let replacementIndex = binarySearch(sortedNums1, num2);

        if (replacementIndex < sortedNums1.length) {
            const reduction = diffs[i] - Math.abs(sortedNums1[replacementIndex] - num2);
            maxReduction = Math.max(maxReduction, reduction);
        }
        if (replacementIndex > 0) {
            const reduction = diffs[i] - Math.abs(sortedNums1[replacementIndex - 1] - num2);
            maxReduction = Math.max(maxReduction, reduction);
        }
    }

    return (totalDiff - maxReduction + MOD) % MOD;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(minAbsoluteSumDiff([1, 7, 5], [2, 3, 5])); // Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

- Sorting `nums1` takes O(n log n).
- Calculating the initial absolute sum difference takes O(n).
- Performing binary search for each element in `nums2` takes O(log n), and since there are `n` elements, this step takes O(n log n).

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n log n).

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity is O(n) due to the storage of the sorted `nums1` array and the `diffs` array.
