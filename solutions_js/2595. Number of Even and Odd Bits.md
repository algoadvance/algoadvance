[Leetcode 2595. Number of Even and Odd Bits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2595)
### Problem Statement:
You are given a positive integer `n`. You need to determine how many bits at even positions (0-indexed) and how many bits at odd positions in the binary representation of `n` are set to `1`. Return an array `result` where:
- `result[0]` is the number of `1` bits at even positions.
- `result[1]` is the number of `1` bits at odd positions.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Binary Representation Direction**:
   - Are the positions counted from the least significant bit (rightmost) starting at position 0?
     - Yes, positions start from the least significant bit.
     
2. **Range of `n`**:
   - What is the allowed range for the integer `n`?
     - `n` is a positive integer generally assumed to be within the typical 32-bit integer range, i.e., `[1, 2^31 - 1]`.
     
3. **Output Format**:
   - Should the result always be an array of two elements?
     - Yes, the output is always an array of two elements: `[countEven, countOdd]`.

### Strategy:
1. Convert `n` to its binary representation.
2. Initialize counters for even and odd positions.
3. Iterate through each bit of the binary representation:
   - If the position is even and the bit is `1`, increment the even counter.
   - If the position is odd and the bit is `1`, increment the odd counter.
4. Return the result array with counts of `1` bits at even and odd positions.

### Code:
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number[]}
 */
function evenOddBitCount(n) {
    let evenCount = 0;
    let oddCount = 0;
    let position = 0;

    while (n > 0) {
        if ((n & 1) === 1) { // Check if the current bit is 1
            if (position % 2 === 0) {
                evenCount++;
            } else {
                oddCount++;
            }
        }
        position++;
        n = n >> 1; // Right shift the number to process the next bit
    }

    return [evenCount, oddCount];
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
  - The algorithm effectively iterates through each bit of the binary representation of `n`, which takes O(log n) time because the number of bits in `n` is proportional to log n.

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - The space usage is constant, as we are only using a fixed amount of extra space for variables like `evenCount`, `oddCount`, and `position`, regardless of the size of `n`.
