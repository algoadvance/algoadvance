[Leetcode 1694. Reformat Phone Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1694)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `number` representing a phone number, consisting of digits, spaces `' '`, and/or dashes `'-'`. You need to reformat the phone number to conform to the following rules:
1. Remove all spaces and dashes.
2. Group the digits from left to right into blocks of length 3 until there are 4 or fewer digits.
3. The final digits should be grouped as follows:
   - 2 blocks of 2 digits if there are 4 digits remaining.
   - 1 block of 2 digits if there are 2 digits remaining.
   - 1 block of 3 digits if there are 3 digits remaining.
   
Return the reformatted string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the input string?
   **A:** The string will only contain digits, spaces, and dashes.
2. **Q:** Can the input string be empty?
   **A:** No, the input string will contain at least one digit.
3. **Q:** Do we need to handle invalid characters?
   **A:** No, the input string is guaranteed to contain only valid characters.

### Strategy
1. Remove all non-digit characters (spaces and dashes) from the input string.
2. Use a loop to break the string into blocks of length 3 while we have more than 4 digits remaining.
3. Once we have 4 or fewer digits, apply the final grouping rule:
   - If there are 4 digits left, group them into two blocks of 2.
   - If there are 3 digits left, group them into one block of 3.
   - If there are 2 digits left, group them into one block of 2.
4. Join these blocks with dashes and return the result.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * Reformat the phone number according to specified rules.
 * @param {string} number - The input phone number string.
 * @return {string} - The reformatted phone number.
 */
function reformatNumber(number) {
    // Remove all non-digit characters (spaces and dashes)
    let digits = number.replace(/[ -]/g, '');

    // Array to hold the final blocks
    let result = [];
    let i = 0;

    // Process digits into blocks of 3 until we have 4 or fewer left
    while (digits.length - i > 4) {
        result.push(digits.substr(i, 3));
        i += 3;
    }

    // Handle the final group of 4 or fewer digits
    let remaining = digits.length - i;
    if (remaining === 4) {
        result.push(digits.substr(i, 2));
        result.push(digits.substr(i + 2, 2));
    } else if (remaining === 3) {
        result.push(digits.substr(i, 3));
    } else if (remaining === 2) {
        result.push(digits.substr(i, 2));
    }

    // Join the blocks with dashes
    return result.join('-');
}

// Example usage:
console.log(reformatNumber("1-23-45 6")); // Output: "123-456"
console.log(reformatNumber("123 4-567")); // Output: "123-45-67"
console.log(reformatNumber("123 4-5678")); // Output: "123-456-78"
console.log(reformatNumber("12")); // Output: "12"
console.log(reformatNumber("--17-5 229 35-39475 ")); // Output: "175-229-353-94-75"
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the input string. The bottleneck operations are traversing the entire string to remove non-digit characters and then processing the remaining digits, both of which are linear operations.
