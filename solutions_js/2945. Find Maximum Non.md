[Leetcode 2945. Find Maximum Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2945)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums`. You need to find the maximum length of a non-decreasing subarray. A non-decreasing subarray is defined as a contiguous portion of the array where every element is greater than or equal to the previous one.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the length of the `nums` array?
   - **A**: No specific constraints other than typical array size limits.

2. **Q**: Can the array contain negative numbers?
   - **A**: Yes, the array can contain any integers, including negative numbers.

3. **Q**: What should be returned if the input array is empty?
   - **A**: If the array is empty, the function should return 0.

4. **Q**: Is a single-element array considered a non-decreasing subarray?
   - **A**: Yes, a single-element array is considered a non-decreasing subarray.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a linear scan to find the maximum length of any non-decreasing subarray. We will iterate through the array while keeping track of the current length of the non-decreasing subarray and the maximum length found so far.

1. Initialize two variables:
   - `maxLength` to store the maximum length of non-decreasing subarray found.
   - `currentLength` to store the length of the current non-decreasing subarray.

2. Iterate through the array starting from the first element.
   - If the current element is greater than or equal to the previous element, increment `currentLength`.
   - If not, update `maxLength` if `currentLength` is greater than `maxLength` and reset `currentLength` to 1.

3. At the end of iteration, update `maxLength` one final time to account for the last processed subarray.

4. Return `maxLength`.

### Code

```javascript
function findLengthOfNonDecreasingSubarray(nums) {
    if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
    
    let maxLength = 1; // Every single element itself is a non-decreasing subarray
    let currentLength = 1;

    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] >= nums[i - 1]) {
            currentLength++;
        } else {
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength);
            currentLength = 1;
        }
    }

    // Final comparison in case the longest subarray ends at the last element
    maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength);

    return maxLength;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. This is because we only need to iterate through the array once to determine the maximum length of non-decreasing subarray.

### Example

```javascript
// Example 1
let nums1 = [1, 3, 5, 4, 7];
console.log(findLengthOfNonDecreasingSubarray(nums1)); // Output: 3

// Example 2
let nums2 = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2];
console.log(findLengthOfNonDecreasingSubarray(nums2)); // Output: 5
```

This code correctly identifies the longest non-decreasing subarray in various scenarios.
