[Leetcode 1392. Longest Happy Prefix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1392)
### Problem Statement
A string is called a "happy prefix" if it is both a prefix and a suffix (excluding the entire string itself). Given a string `s`, return the longest happy prefix of `s`. If no such prefix exists, return an empty string.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: Is the input string `s` guaranteed to be non-empty?
   - Yes, the problem states the input will be a string, but it is good to confirm if the string length can be zero.
   
2. **Character Set**: Does the string contain only lowercase English letters?
   - Typically yes, as the problem does not specify otherwise.

3. **Output**: Should the function return an empty string if there are no happy prefixes?
   - Yes.

### Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var longestPrefix = function(s) {
    let n = s.length;
    let lps = new Array(n).fill(0);
    
    let length = 0; // length of the previous longest prefix suffix
    let i = 1;
    
    while (i < n) {
        if (s[i] === s[length]) {
            length++;
            lps[i] = length;
            i++;
        } else {
            if (length !== 0) {
                length = lps[length - 1];
            } else {
                lps[i] = 0;
                i++;
            }
        }
    }

    let longestHappyPrefixLength = lps[n - 1];
    return s.substring(0, longestHappyPrefixLength);
};
```

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we will use the KMP (Knuth-Morris-Pratt) pattern matching algorithm's preprocessing step. The idea is as follows:

1. **LPS Array Construction**: We build the Longest Prefix which is also Suffix (LPS) array.
2. **Using LPS Array**: The value at the last index of the LPS array will give us the length of the longest happy prefix.
3. **Extract the Prefix**: Extract the prefix from the given string using the length we found.

#### Steps:
1. Create an array `lps` where `lps[i]` will hold the length of the longest proper prefix which is also a suffix for the substring `s[0...i]`.
2. Iterate from the first to the last character of the string and build the `lps` array accordingly.
3. Once the LPS array is built, the value at the last index of the array will give us the length of the longest prefix which is also a suffix.
4. Return the substring from the beginning of the string to the obtained length.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: The algorithm runs in O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because we are iterating over the string to build the LPS array.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) as we use an array of size n to store the LPS values.

This approach guarantees an efficient solution to the problem by leveraging the properties of the KMP algorithm.
