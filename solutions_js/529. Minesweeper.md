[Leetcode 529. Minesweeper](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l529)
### Problem Statement

Let's implement the Minesweeper game in JavaScript. The Minesweeper board is represented by a 2D character array. Here are the elements involved:
  - 'M': Represents an unrevealed mine.
  - 'E': Represents an unrevealed empty square.
  - 'B': Represents a revealed blank square that has no adjacent mines.
  - A digit (1 to 8): Represents the number of adjacent mines to a revealed square.

Given the `board` and a `click` position, return the updated board after applying the click.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What happens if a mine ('M') is clicked?**
   - The board should reveal that mine and the game is over.

2. **What if an empty square ('E') is clicked?**
   - If the clicked square has no adjacent mines, it should be revealed as 'B'. Additionally, all adjacent squares should be revealed recursively.
   - If there are adjacent mines, reveal the count of adjacent mines.

3. **What is the format of the board and click?**
   - Assume the board is an `m x n` 2D array of characters.
   - The `click` is an array [i, j] representing the indices of the board.

4. **What are the constraints on the input?**
   - `m == board.length`
   - `n == board[i].length`
   - 1 <= m, n <= 100
   - `click.length == 2`
   - `0 <= click[i] < m`
   - `0 <= click[j] < n`

### Code

```javascript
function updateBoard(board, click) {
    const directions = [
        [-1, -1], [-1, 0], [-1, 1],
        [0, -1],         [0, 1],
        [1, -1], [1, 0], [1, 1],
    ];
    
    const [clickX, clickY] = click;

    if (board[clickX][clickY] === 'M') {
        board[clickX][clickY] = 'X';
        return board;
    }

    const reveal = (x, y) => {
        if (x < 0 || x >= board.length || y < 0 || y >= board[0].length || board[x][y] !== 'E') return;

        let mineCount = 0;
        for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
            const nx = x + dx;
            const ny = y + dy;
            if (nx >= 0 && nx < board.length && ny >= 0 && ny < board[0].length && board[nx][ny] === 'M') {
                mineCount++;
            }
        }

        if (mineCount === 0) {
            board[x][y] = 'B';
            for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
                reveal(x + dx, y + dy);
            }
        } else {
            board[x][y] = mineCount.toString();
        }
    };

    reveal(clickX, clickY);
    return board;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Click Processing:**
   - If the clicked cell is a mine ('M'), change it to 'X' to indicate game over.

2. **Empty Cell Processing:**
   - If an 'E' cell is clicked, determine the number of adjacent mines.
   - Implement a recursive function to reveal all adjacent 'E' cells if no adjacent mines are found.

3. **Iterate in Directions:**
   - Use a list of direction vectors to simplify checking adjacent cells.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. This complexity arises because, in the worst case, every empty cell needs to be revealed.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m * n) due to recursive call stack in the worst case.
