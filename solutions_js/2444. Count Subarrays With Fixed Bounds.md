[Leetcode 2444. Count Subarrays With Fixed Bounds](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2444)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and two integers `minK` and `maxK`, return the number of subarrays where the minimum value in the subarray is equal to `minK` and the maximum value is equal to `maxK`.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**:
   - What are the bounds for the length of `nums`? (e.g., Can `nums` be very large, like up to 100,000 elements?)
   - What are the possible values for `minK` and `maxK`? (e.g., Can they include negative values?)

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - What should we return if `nums` is empty?
   - How should the function handle the case when no subarray meets the criteria?

3. **Subarray Validity**:
   - Are `minK` and `maxK` guaranteed to be present in the array? Or should we handle cases where one or both of them are missing?

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Counters and Pointers**:
   - We'll use pointers or indices to keep track of the current subarray bounds.
   - Use counters to track the number of valid subarrays.

2. **Traverse the Array**:
   - Iterate over each element in `nums`.
   - Track the most recent indices where `minK` and `maxK` were found.
   - If an element invalidates the subarray (i.e., itâ€™s smaller than `minK` or larger than `maxK`), reset pointers.

3. **Count Valid Subarrays**:
   - Calculate the number of valid subarrays ending at each position based on the positions of the last valid `minK` and `maxK`.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the strategy outlined above:

```javascript
function countSubarrays(nums, minK, maxK) {
    let count = 0;
    let n = nums.length;
    let minKPos = -1, maxKPos = -1;
    let leftBound = -1;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (nums[i] < minK || nums[i] > maxK) {
            leftBound = i;
        }
        if (nums[i] === minK) {
            minKPos = i;
        }
        if (nums[i] === maxK) {
            maxKPos = i;
        }

        if (minKPos !== -1 && maxKPos !== -1) {
            count += Math.max(0, Math.min(minKPos, maxKPos) - leftBound);
        }
    }

    return count;
}
```

### Explanation

- **leftBound**: Keeps track of the most recent position where an element pushed the subarray out of valid bounds (i.e., less than `minK` or greater than `maxK`).
- **minKPos & maxKPos**: Track the last positions where `minK` and `maxK` were found.
- As we iterate through `nums`, we update these indices.
- Whenever both `minK` and `maxK` have been found within a valid subarray (i.e., `minKPos` and `maxKPos` are not `-1`), we add the number of valid subarrays ending at the current index.
  
### Time Complexity

- **O(n)**: The algorithm runs in linear time, with `n` being the length of `nums`. Each element is processed once.

This approach ensures we efficiently count subarrays by leveraging pointers to keep track of boundaries and positions dynamically.
