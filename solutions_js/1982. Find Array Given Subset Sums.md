[Leetcode 1982. Find Array Given Subset Sums](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1982)
## Problem Statement:
You are given an integer array `nums` of size `n` containing all distinct numbers from `1` to `2n`, and an integer array `subset_sums` containing the sums of all 2^n possible subsets of `nums`. Return the integer array `nums`.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Q:** What constraints are given for the inputs?
   **A:** The problem states that `nums` contains all distinct numbers from `1` to `2n`. The length of `subset_sums` is `2^n`.
   
2. **Q:** Can `subset_sums` contain duplicates?
   **A:** No, because each subset of `nums` will have a unique sum as all elements in `nums` are distinct.
   
3. **Q:** How should the output be presented?
   **A:** The output should be an array `nums` with integers sorted in ascending order.

## Strategy:
1. **Understand Subset Properties**:
    - The `subset_sums` array includes the sum of every possible subset, starting from the empty subset (sum = 0).
    - By leveraging properties of subsets and known sums, we can reconstruct the original `nums`.

2. **Initial Thoughts**:
    - Given that there are `2^n` subset sums, we need to find a systematic way to peel back these sums to the original numbers.

3. **Approach**:
    - Identify the smallest and largest values initially present in the sorted `subset_sums` array. These values can often lead us back to individual elements in `nums`.
    - Iteratively remove the influence of identified numbers from remaining sums in `subset_sums` and continue until `nums` is fully reconstructed.

## Code:

Here's an efficient implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function findNumsFromSubsetSums(subset_sums) {
    subset_sums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    const n = Math.sqrt(subset_sums.length);
    const nums = [];
    
    while (nums.length < n) {
        const original = subset_sums[1] - subset_sums[0]; // the smallest non-zero element
        nums.push(original);
        
        const newSubsetSums = [];
        const subset_dict = {};
        
        for (let s of subset_sums) {
            if (subset_dict[s]) {
                subset_dict[s] -= 1;
            } else {
                newSubsetSums.push(s);
                if (!subset_dict[s + original]) {
                    subset_dict[s + original] = 0;
                }
                subset_dict[s + original] += 1;
            }
        }
        
        subset_sums = newSubsetSums;
    }
    
    return nums;
}
```

## Explanation:
1. **Sort the Array**: Begin by sorting the `subset_sums` array.
2. **Iterative Extraction**:
    - Iterate until we've extracted `n` numbers.
    - In each iteration, find the smallest non-zero element (difference between the first two elements in sorted `subset_sums`).
    - Append this difference to `nums`.
3. **Filtering**:
    - Maintain a tally of occurrences of sums and use it to filter out sums that include the newly identified number.
    - Update the `subset_sums` array to exclude these "influenced" sums.
    
4. **Return the Result**: Once `nums` is fully reconstructed, return it.

## Time Complexity:
- Sorting the `subset_sums` array takes `O(2^n log(2^n)) = O(n 2^n)`.
- The filtering process inside the loop runs `n` times over `2^n` sums, leading to `O(n 2^n)` time complexity.
- This makes the total time complexity `O(n 2^n)`.
