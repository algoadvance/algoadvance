[Leetcode 725. Split Linked List in Parts](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l725)
### Problem Statement

You are given the `head` of a singly linked list and an integer `k`. Split the linked list into `k` consecutive linked list parts.

The length of each part should be as equal as possible: no two parts should have a size differing by more than one. This may lead to some parts being null.

The parts should be in the order of their original nodes, and parts that are null should be represented as null in the output.

Return an array of the `k` parts.

**Example:**

```
Input:
head = [1, 2, 3], k = 5
Output: [[1], [2], [3], [], []]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What constitutes a linked list part?**
   - Each part should be a linked list comprising consecutive nodes from the original list.

2. **Will the input contain fewer nodes than `k`?**
   - Yes, and this will result in some parts being empty.

3. **Should we create new nodes or just manipulate pointers?**
   - We should manipulate pointers to create the parts.

4. **Can the values of the linked list be negative or zero?**
   - Yes, the values inside the nodes can be any integer.

### Strategy

1. **Count the Total Number of Nodes:**
   - Traverse the linked list to determine its total length.

2. **Determine the Size of Each Part:**
   - Compute the base size of each part as `length // k`.
   - Compute the remainder as `length % k`, which tells how many parts need to be one node larger.

3. **Create the Parts:**
   - Iterate through the list, creating each part by adjusting pointers.

### Code

```javascript
class ListNode {
    constructor(val = 0, next = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.next = next;
    }
}

function splitListToParts(head, k) {
    let current = head;
    let length = 0;
    
    // Calculate the total length of the linked list
    while (current !== null) {
        length++;
        current = current.next;
    }
    
    let partSize = Math.floor(length / k),
        extraNodes = length % k;
    
    let parts = new Array(k).fill(null);
    let node = head;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        if (node === null) break;
        
        parts[i] = node;
        let currentPartSize = partSize + (i < extraNodes ? 1 : 0);
        
        for (let j = 1; j < currentPartSize; j++) {
            node = node ? node.next : null;
        }
        
        let next = node ? node.next : null;
        if (node) node.next = null;
        node = next;
    }
    
    return parts;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Finding the length of the linked list:** O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list.
- **Splitting the list into parts:** O(k + n), because in the worst case scenario, we iterate over each node to split the parts and we perform additional operations up to `k` times.

Overall, the time complexity is O(n + k).
