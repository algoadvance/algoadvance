[Leetcode 1028. Recover a Tree From Preorder Traversal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1028)
## Problem Statement

Given a string representing the preorder traversal of a binary tree with node values and their levels indicated by dashes. The input consists of integer values and dashes, where the number of dashes indicates the depth of the node in the tree starting from 0. For example, the string "1-2--3--4-5--6--7" represents the preorder traversal of this binary tree:

```
        1
       / \
      2   5
     / \ / \
    3  4 6  7
```

The task is to recover the binary tree from this preorder traversal string and return its root.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input format:** Is there a guarantee that the input is a valid preorder traversal string as described?
   - Yes, we can assume the input is valid as per the problem description.
   
2. **Output format:** Should the output be the root of the tree?
   - Yes, the function should return the root node of the reconstructed binary tree.

3. **Tree properties:** Are all node values unique?
   - Yes, node values are given as integers and are unique.

## Strategy

1. We'll iterate through the string while parsing node values and their corresponding depths.
2. We can use a stack to maintain nodes at different levels.
3. For each new node:
   - If its depth is greater than the depth of the node on top of the stack, it is the left child of the top node.
   - If its depth is equal or less than the depth of the top node, we pop from the stack until we find the correct parent node, then it is considered as the right child of the current parent node at the stack top.
4. Add the newly created node to the stack.

## Code

```javascript
class TreeNode {
    constructor(val) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = null;
        this.right = null;
    }
}

function recoverFromPreorder(S) {
    let stack = [];
    let i = 0;

    while (i < S.length) {
        let level = 0;
        while (S[i] === '-') {
            level++;
            i++;
        }
        
        let start = i;
        while (i < S.length && isDigit(S[i])) {
            i++;
        }
        let val = parseInt(S.substring(start, i));
        let node = new TreeNode(val);

        while (stack.length > level) {
            stack.pop();
        }

        if (stack.length) {
            if (!stack[stack.length - 1].left) {
                stack[stack.length - 1].left = node;
            } else {
                stack[stack.length - 1].right = node;
            }
        }

        stack.push(node);
    }

    while (stack.length > 1) {
        stack.pop();
    }

    return stack[0];
}

function isDigit(ch) {
    return ch >= '0' && ch <= '9';
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Parsing the string:** O(N), where N is the length of the string, for determining levels and values.
- **Stack operations:** Each node is pushed and popped from the stack exactly once.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the string.

## Space Complexity
- **Stack usage:** In the worst case, the stack contains all the nodes in the path from the root to the deepest leaf, so the space complexity is O(D), where D is the depth of the tree.

This solution efficiently constructs the binary tree from the preorder traversal string while maintaining the required relationships between nodes.
