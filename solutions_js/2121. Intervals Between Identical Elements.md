[Leetcode 2121. Intervals Between Identical Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2121)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of integers `arr`. For each element in `arr`, determine intervals to all its duplicate elements. The interval between two elements at indices `i` and `j` is `abs(i - j)` (the absolute difference between indices `i` and `j`).

Return an array `result`, where `result[i]` is the sum of intervals between the element at index `i` and all its duplicates.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Should the intervals be summed up for each element even if that element is unique?
   - Yes, if the element is unique in the array, its intervals sum to 0 (as there are no duplicates).
2. Are negative indices or invalid input cases (like non-integer elements in the array) part of the problem scope?
   - No, assume the input will always be a valid array of integers.
3. What is the maximum length of the input array?
   - Typical constraints are up to 10^5 elements.

### Strategy
1. **Build a Dictionary:** First, collect all indices for each unique element in a dictionary.
2. **Compute Intervals:** For each element in the input `arr`, use the precomputed indices to calculate the sum of intervals.
3. **Sum of Intervals:** For each index where the element appears, compute the sum of differences between that index and every other index of the same element.

### Code
Hereâ€™s the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function getDistances(arr) {
    const indexMap = new Map();
    const result = new Array(arr.length).fill(0);

    // Step 1: Collect indices of all elements in a dictionary
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (!indexMap.has(arr[i])) {
            indexMap.set(arr[i], []);
        }
        indexMap.get(arr[i]).push(i);
    }

    // Step 2: Calculate sum of intervals for each element
    for (let indices of indexMap.values()) {
        if (indices.length > 1) {
            const prefixSum = new Array(indices.length + 1).fill(0);

            for (let i = 1; i <= indices.length; i++) {
                prefixSum[i] = prefixSum[i - 1] + indices[i - 1];
            }

            for (let i = 0; i < indices.length; i++) {
                const leftSum = i * indices[i] - prefixSum[i];
                const rightSum = prefixSum[indices.length] - prefixSum[i + 1] - (indices.length - i - 1) * indices[i];
                result[indices[i]] = leftSum + rightSum;
            }
        }
    }
    return result;
}
```

### Strategy Explanation
1. **Building the Dictionary:**
   - Iterate through `arr` and store each element's indices in a dictionary (`indexMap`), where the key is the element and the value is an array of indices.
2. **Compute Prefix Sum for Efficient Calculation:**
   - For elements with more than one occurrence, compute a prefix sum array to efficiently calculate the sum of intervals.
3. **Calculate Sum of Intervals Using Prefix Sum:**
   - For each index of the current element, use the prefix sum to calculate the distance to all other indices.

### Time Complexity
- **Step 1:** We iterate through the array once to build `indexMap`: `O(n)`.
- **Step 2:** We calculate the sum of intervals for each element. For each element, this involves calculating prefix sums and then computing interval sums for each index. This step is also `O(n)` since each index is visited only a constant number of times.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input array `arr`.
