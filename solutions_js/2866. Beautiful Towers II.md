[Leetcode 2866. Beautiful Towers II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2866)
Certainly! Let's go step by step.

### Problem Statement

You are given two arrays `positions` and `heights` both of size `n`. The `positions` array contains integer positions of towers on a 1-dimensional field, and `heights` array contains integer heights of those towers.

A tower located at position `positions[i]` with height `heights[i]` can provide a height of `h - |p - positions[i]|` at any position `p`, which means the height decreases linearly with the distance from the tower's position.

Your task is to determine the maximum height that can be achieved at any position after considering all towers.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the positions array contain duplicate values?
   - No, the positions array will have unique values.
   
2. What are the constraints for the values in `positions` and `heights`?
   - Both positions and heights will be within the range of integers.

### Code

Here is a JavaScript solution for the problem:

```javascript
var maxBuildingHeight = function(positions, heights) {
    let n = positions.length;
    
    // Initially, max height is the height of the first tower
    let maxHeight = heights[0];

    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        // Calculate maximum height that can be achieved at positions[i]
        let distance = positions[i] - positions[i - 1];
        let effectiveHeight = Math.min(heights[i], heights[i - 1] + distance);
        
        // Update the current height with effective height
        heights[i] = effectiveHeight;
        
        // Update the maximum height achieved
        maxHeight = Math.max(maxHeight, effectiveHeight);
    }
    return maxHeight;
};

// Example usage:
let positions = [1, 2, 4, 7];
let heights = [2, 1, 4, 6];
console.log(maxBuildingHeight(positions, heights)); // Output: 6
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Maximum Height**: Start with the height of the first tower as the initial maximum height.
2. **Traverse**: Iterate through the towers from the second tower to the last tower.
3. **Effective Height Calculation**:
    - Calculate the distance between the current tower and the previous tower.
    - The maximum height that can be achieved at the current position is determined by taking the minimum of the current tower height and the previous tower height plus the distance between them. This respects the linear decrease of height.
4. **Update Heights**: Update the current tower height to the effective height.
5. **Update Maximum Height**: Keep a running maximum of the heights seen so far.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The solution runs in `O(n)` time since we are traversing through the list of towers once.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(1)` since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the maximum achievable height by considering the constraints of the height decrease over the distance.
