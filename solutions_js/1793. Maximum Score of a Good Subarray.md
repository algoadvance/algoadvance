[Leetcode 1793. Maximum Score of a Good Subarray](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1793)
### Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers `nums` (0-indexed) and an integer `k`, return the maximum score of a good subarray. A subarray is considered good if it contains the element `nums[k]`.

The score of a subarray (i, j) is defined as `min(nums[i], nums[i+1], ..., nums[j]) * (j - i + 1)`. 

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can the subarray be of length 1?
   - Yes, any subarray including `nums[k]` is valid, including a single element subarray.
2. Is `k` guaranteed to be a valid index within `nums`?
   - Yes, `k` is a valid index in the array `nums`.
3. Can `nums` contain negative values?
   - Yes, `nums` can contain negative values.
4. What are the constraints on `nums`?
   - Usually, constraints like size and value ranges will be given in the problem description. Let's assume a typical constraint size for arrays like `0 <= k < nums.length` and `nums.length <= 10^5`.

### Strategy:
1. We start considering the subarray that includes the element `nums[k]` by initializing `left` and `right` pointers both at `k`.
2. The score of this subarray is initially `nums[k] * 1` (since it only contains one element).
3. Expand the subarray by moving the `left` pointer to the left or the `right` pointer to the right. Each time we expand, we include either `nums[left - 1]` or `nums[right + 1]` based on which one is larger to maximize the minimum value in the subarray.
4. Calculate the score for the new subarray on each expansion and update the maximum score if the calculated score is greater.
5. Continue this process until both pointers reach the boundaries of the array.

### Code:
```javascript
function maximumScore(nums, k) {
    let left = k;
    let right = k;
    let minVal = nums[k];
    let maxScore = nums[k];

    while (left > 0 || right < nums.length - 1) {
        if (left == 0) {
            right++;
        } else if (right == nums.length - 1) {
            left--;
        } else if (nums[left - 1] > nums[right + 1]) {
            left--;
        } else {
            right++;
        }
        
        minVal = Math.min(minVal, nums[left], nums[right]);
        maxScore = Math.max(maxScore, minVal * (right - left + 1));
    }
    
    return maxScore;
}
```

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this approach is O(n) where `n` is the length of the array `nums`. We are expanding the subarray by moving the pointers left and right at most `n` times in total, and each expansion step involves constant time operations.

### Explanation:
This solution starts by considering `nums[k]` as the beginning subarray and expands this subarray by moving either the left or the right boundary, choosing the direction that includes a larger value to maximize the minimum value in the subarray. The process continues until the subarray spans the entire array, ensuring we find the maximum possible score.
