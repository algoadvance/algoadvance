[Leetcode 879. Profitable Schemes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l879)
## Problem Statement

You are tasked with planning an organized crime. Suppose there are `G` gang members, a list of `group` where each element represents the number of members required for a particular crime, and a list of `profit` where each element represents the profit gained from a particular crime. Your task is to calculate the total number of schemes that can be chosen such that the profit is at least `P`, while the number of gang members involved does not exceed `G`. Since the answer can be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Example:

- Input: `G = 5`, `P = 3`, `group = [2, 2]`, `profit = [2, 3]`
- Output: `2`
- Explanation:
  - To make a profit of at least 3, there are two schemes.
  1. Take both crimes, using 4 gang members and 5 profit (2 + 3).
  2. Take the second crime, using 2 gang members and 3 profit.

### Constraints:

- `1 <= G <= 100`
- `0 <= P <= 100`
- `1 <= group[i] <= 100`
- `0 <= profit[i] <= 100`
- `group.length == profit.length`
- `1 <= group.length <= 100`

## Plan and Clarifying Questions

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can a scheme include multiple crimes?
   - Yes, a scheme can include zero or more crimes.
2. Can group[i] or profit[i] be zero?
   - No, as per the constraints each `group[i]` is at least 1.

### Strategy
We'll use a dynamic programming approach to solve this problem:
1. Define a 3D DP array `dp` such that `dp[i][j][k]` represents the number of ways to choose the first `i` crimes with exactly `j` gang members and at least `k` profit.
2. Initialize `dp[0][0][0]` to 1 because there is one way to commit zero crimes with zero profit using zero members.
3. Loop through each number of crimes, updating the dp array based on whether the current crime is committed or not.
4. Return the sum of all schemes where the profit is at least `P`.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is `O(N * G * P)` where `N` is the number of crimes, `G` is the number of gang members, and `P` is the required profit.

## Code

```javascript
function profitableSchemes(G, P, group, profit) {
    const MOD = 1e9 + 7;
    const n = group.length;
    
    // DP array
    let dp = Array.from({ length: G + 1 }, () => Array(P + 1).fill(0));
    dp[0][0] = 1;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let g = group[i];
        let p = profit[i];

        for (let j = G; j >= g; j--) {
            for (let k = P; k >= 0; k--) {
                dp[j][Math.min(P, k + p)] = (dp[j][Math.min(P, k + p)] + dp[j - g][k]) % MOD;
            }
        }
    }

    let result = 0;

    for (let j = 0; j <= G; j++) {
        result = (result + dp[j][P]) % MOD;
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is `O(N * G * P)` where:
- `N` is the number of crimes.
- `G` is the number of gang members.
- `P` is the required profit.

This ensures that we can handle the constraints efficiently within the given bounds.
