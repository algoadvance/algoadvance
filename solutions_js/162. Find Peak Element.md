[Leetcode 162. Find Peak Element](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l162)
### Problem Statement

A peak element is an element that is strictly greater than its neighbors. Given an integer array `nums`, find a peak element, and return its index. If the array contains multiple peaks, return the index of any of the peaks.

You may imagine that `nums[-1] = -∞` and `nums[n] = -∞`.

You must write an algorithm that runs in `O(log n)` time.

### Example
```python
Input: nums = [1,2,3,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 3 is a peak element and your function should return the index number 2.
```

```python
Input: nums = [1,2,1,3,5,6,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: Your function can return either index number 1 where the peak element is 2, or index number 5 where the peak element is 6.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain all identical elements?**
   - Yes, but since we are looking for a strict peak, identical elements would not have any strictly greater neighbors.

2. **What should we return if the array has a single element?**
   - The single element is trivially the peak, so return its index which is `0`.

3. **If the peak is at the first or last position, should we consider it a peak?**
   - Yes, as per the problem statement the boundaries are considered `-∞`.

### Strategy

To achieve the `O(log n)` time complexity, we can use a binary search approach. The idea is to:
1. Choose the middle element.
2. Compare the middle element with its neighbors.
3. If the middle element is greater than both its neighbors, it is a peak.
4. If the left neighbor is greater, then the peak must be in the left half.
5. If the right neighbor is greater, then the peak must be in the right half.

### Code

Here is the JavaScript implementation:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var findPeakElement = function(nums) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;
    
    while (left < right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        
        if (nums[mid] > nums[mid + 1]) {
            // We are in the descending part of the array.
            right = mid;
        } else {
            // We are in the ascending part of the array.
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    
    // At the end of the loop, left == right
    return left;
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization**: Set `left` to `0` and `right` to `nums.length - 1`.
2. **Binary Search**:
   - Compute the middle index `mid`.
   - Compare `nums[mid]` and `nums[mid + 1]`:
     - If `nums[mid]` is greater than `nums[mid + 1]`, then the peak is in the left half including `mid`.
     - If `nums[mid]` is less than `nums[mid + 1]`, then the peak is in the right half after `mid`.
3. **Return**: After the loop, `left` will be equal to `right`, which will be the peak element's index.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(log n)` because at each step, we reduce the search space by half. This makes it efficient for large arrays.
