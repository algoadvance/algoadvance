[Leetcode 3250. Find the Count of Monotonic Pairs I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3250)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers, you need to find the count of monotonic pairs `(i, j)` where `0 <= i < j < n` and either:
1. `arr[i] < arr[j]` (strictly increasing), or
2. `arr[i] > arr[j]` (strictly decreasing).

The result should include the count of both strictly increasing and strictly decreasing pairs.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Does the array contain only integers?
2. Can the array have duplicate elements?
3. Do the pairs need to be contiguous subarrays, or can they be any two elements in the array?
4. Is there any constraint on the size of the array (e.g., maximum length)?

Assuming the array contains only integers, can have duplicates, the pairs can be any two elements in the array, and there is no specific constraint on the size of the array.

### Strategy
1. We will use a double loop to iterate over all possible pairs `(i, j)` where `0 <= i < j < n`.
2. For each pair `(i, j)`, we will check if `arr[i] < arr[j]` or `arr[i] > arr[j]`.
3. If any of these conditions is satisfied, we will count the pair as a monotonic pair.
4. Finally, we will return the count of such monotonic pairs.

### Code

Here's the implementation of the strategy:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 * @return {number}
 */
function countMonotonicPairs(arr) {
    let count = 0;
    let n = arr.length;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (arr[i] < arr[j] || arr[i] > arr[j]) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}

// Example usage:
let arr = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(countMonotonicPairs(arr)); // Output: 6
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n^2)\) because we are using a nested loop to check all pairs.
- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since we are only using a constant amount of extra space.

If the given array can be very large, optimizations may need to be considered as \(O(n^2)\) could be too slow. However, for moderate sizes, this straightforward solution should be adequate.
