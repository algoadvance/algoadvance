[Leetcode 2333. Minimum Sum of Squared Difference](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2333)
### Problem Statement

You are given four integers `num1`, `num2`, `num3`, and `num4`. Your task is to calculate the minimum possible sum of squared differences between two sets that you can form. Specifically, you need to distribute these four numbers into two pairs such that the sum of squared differences between pairs is minimized. The squared difference for a pair `(a, b)` is defined as `(a - b)^2`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we assume all input numbers are integers?**
   - Yes, all input numbers are guaranteed to be integers.

2. **Is there any constraint on the range of values for the input integers?**
   - Typically, for LeetCode problems, the inputs can range from -10^9 to 10^9.

3. **How do we handle duplicate numbers in the input?**
   - The approach should still minimize the sum of squared differences, even if there are duplicates.

4. **Should we expect the input to always contain exactly four integers?**
   - Yes, the problem specifically states that there will be four integers.

### Strategy

To minimize the sum of squared differences, the basic strategy is to sort the array of the four integers, pair them optimally based on their absolute differences, and then calculate the sum of squared differences for the pairs. 

1. **Sort** the array of the four integers: `arr = [num1, num2, num3, num4]`.
2. **Form pairs** from the sorted array to minimize squared differences. A good heuristic is to pair the smallest elements with the smallest elements and the largest elements with the largest.
3. **Calculate the sum** of the squared differences for the pairs formed.
4. Return the computed sum.

### Code

```javascript
function minSumOfSquaredDifference(num1, num2, num3, num4) {
    // Step 1: Create an array of the numbers and sort it to make pairing easier
    let nums = [num1, num2, num3, num4];
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    // Step 2: Form pairs optimally and calculate the sum of their squared differences
    let sumSquaredDiff = 0;
    
    sumSquaredDiff += Math.pow(nums[0] - nums[1], 2);
    sumSquaredDiff += Math.pow(nums[2] - nums[3], 2);
    
    return sumSquaredDiff;
}

// Test the function with an example
console.log(minSumOfSquaredDifference(1, 3, 2, 4)); // Output should be 2
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the numbers**: `O(4 log 4)` which simplifies to `O(1)` since the number of elements is constant (4).
- **Computing the squared differences**: `O(1)` since it involves a fixed number of arithmetic operations.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(1)`.

### Explanation with Example

Given `num1 = 1`, `num2 = 3`, `num3 = 2`, `num4 = 4`:

1. **Sorted Array**: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
2. **Optimal Pairing**: (1, 2) and (3, 4)
3. **Squared Differences**: 
    - For pair (1, 2): `(1 - 2)^2 = 1`
    - For pair (3, 4): `(3 - 4)^2 = 1`
4. **Sum**: `1 + 1 = 2`

Thus, the function returns the minimum sum of squared differences as `2`.

This strategy ensures that we achieve the minimum possible sum of squared differences.
