[Leetcode 1358. Number of Substrings Containing All Three Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1358)
### Problem Statement:

LeetCode Problem 1358: "Number of Substrings Containing All Three Characters"

Given a string `s` consisting only of characters 'a', 'b', and 'c', return the number of substrings containing at least one occurrence of all these characters.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **What is the string length limit?**
   - The problem generally assumes that the string can be quite large, up to 100,000 characters.
   
2. **Is the string guaranteed to contain all characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'?**
   - No, the string may not contain all three characters. You are to count substrings that contain all three characters if they exist.

3. **Are all characters guaranteed to be lowercase 'a', 'b', and 'c'?**
   - Yes, the input string consists only of the characters 'a', 'b', and 'c'.

### Strategy:

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the sliding window (two pointers) technique. The idea is to expand and contract a window to find all valid substrings.

1. **Initialize two pointers**: `start` and `end` both at the beginning of the string.
2. **Expand the window by moving the `end` pointer**: Increase the count of the characters within the window until we have all three characters.
3. **Contract the window by moving the `start` pointer**: Decrease the size of the window while maintaining at least one of each character inside.
4. **Count valid substrings**: Every time a valid window is found, all substrings ending with the character at `end` and starting from any point between `start` to `end` are valid.

The number of valid substrings can be deduced by the formula: `len(s) - end`, where `end` is the right pointer marking the end of the current valid substring.

### Code:

```javascript
function numberOfSubstrings(s) {
    let count = 0;
    let freq = { 'a': 0, 'b': 0, 'c': 0 };
    let start = 0;
    let n = s.length;

    for (let end = 0; end < n; end++) {
        freq[s[end]]++;

        // Once we have at least one of each 'a', 'b', and 'c'
        while (freq['a'] > 0 && freq['b'] > 0 && freq['c'] > 0) {
            // All substrings starting from `start` to `end` will be valid
            count += n - end;
            freq[s[start]]--;
            start++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

// Example Usage
console.log(numberOfSubstrings("abcabc"));  // Output: 10
console.log(numberOfSubstrings("aaacb"));   // Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where `N` is the length of the string. Each character in the string is processed at most twice, once by the `end` pointer and once by the `start` pointer.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), only a fixed amount of extra space is used regardless of the input size.

This approach ensures that we find the result efficiently even for large strings.
