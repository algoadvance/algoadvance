[Leetcode 2386. Find the K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2386)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. The k-sum of the array is defined as the k<sup>th</sup> largest sum of any subsequence of the array. Return the k-sum of the array.

A subsequence is defined as an array derived from the original array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the elements in the `nums` array be negative?
   - Yes, the elements in `nums` can be negative, positive, or zero.

2. What is the expected range of values for `k` and the length of `nums`?
   - Typically, `k` would be a positive integer and not greater than the total number of subsequences for practical purposes.

3. Should a subsequence contain at least one element?
   - Every non-empty subsequence is considered valid, but the empty subsequence (sum = 0) should be included as a valid subsequence for the sake of calculating k-sums.

### Strategy

To approach this problem:
1. **Understanding Subsequences**: All subsequences of an array need to be considered, including the empty one.
2. **Use Priority Queue**: Using a max-heap (priority queue) will help efficiently find the k-th largest sum.
3. **Iterate and Add**: Iterate over the array, and for each element, generate new subsequences by adding the element to existing subsequences.

### Code

```javascript
function findKSum(nums, k) {
    const n = nums.length;
    let subsequences = [0];
    
    // Priority queue for storing the maximum subsequence sums
    let pq = new MinPriorityQueue({ compare: (a, b) => a - b });
    
    for (let num of nums) {
        let newSubsequences = [];
        for (let subseqSum of subsequences) {
            newSubsequences.push(subseqSum + num);
        }
        subsequences.push(...newSubsequences);
    }
    
    for (let sum of subsequences) {
        pq.enqueue(sum);
        if (pq.size() > k) {
            pq.dequeue();
        }
    }
    
    return pq.front();
}

// MinPriorityQueue class implementation or use suitable library
class MinPriorityQueue {
    constructor(options = {}) {
        this.data = [];
        this.compare = options.compare || ((a, b) => a - b);
    }

    size() {
        return this.data.length;
    }

    enqueue(value) {
        this.data.push(value);
        this.heapifyUp();
    }

    dequeue() {
        const root = this.data[0];
        const last = this.data.pop();
        if (this.data.length > 0) {
            this.data[0] = last;
            this.heapifyDown();
        }
        return root;
    }

    front() {
        return this.data[0] || null;
    }

    heapifyUp() {
        let index = this.data.length - 1;
        while (index > 0) {
            let parentIndex = Math.floor((index - 1) / 2);
            if (this.compare(this.data[index], this.data[parentIndex]) >= 0) break;
            [this.data[index], this.data[parentIndex]] = [this.data[parentIndex], this.data[index]];
            index = parentIndex;
        }
    }

    heapifyDown() {
        let index = 0;
        const length = this.data.length;
        const element = this.data[0];

        while (true) {
            let leftChildIdx = 2 * index + 1;
            let rightChildIdx = 2 * index + 2;
            let leftChild, rightChild;
            let swap = null;

            if (leftChildIdx < length) {
                leftChild = this.data[leftChildIdx];
                if (this.compare(leftChild, element) < 0) {
                    swap = leftChildIdx;
                }
            }
            if (rightChildIdx < length) {
                rightChild = this.data[rightChildIdx];
                if (this.compare(rightChild, (swap === null ? element : leftChild)) < 0) {
                    swap = rightChildIdx;
                }
            }

            if (swap === null) break;
            [this.data[index], this.data[swap]] = [this.data[swap], this.data[index]];
            index = swap;
        }
    }
}

// Example usage
console.log(findKSum([1, 2, 3], 2)); // Example output
```

### Time Complexity

- Generating all subsequences and calculating their sums takes \(O(2^n)\) time as there are \(2^n\) subsequences for an array of length \(n\).
- Maintaining the priority queue with up to \(k\) elements takes \(O(k \log k)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(2^n + k \log k)\).

This can become inefficient for large \(n\) due to \(O(2^n)\). Optimizations might include using combinations or targeted algorithms to avoid generating all subsequences directly.
