[Leetcode 1381. Design a Stack With Increment Operation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1381)
### Problem Statement

Design a stack that supports increment operations on its elements. Implement the `CustomStack` class:

- `CustomStack(int maxSize)` Initializes the object with `maxSize` which is the maximum number of elements in the stack or do nothing if the stack reached the `maxSize`.
- `void push(int x)` Adds `x` to the top of the stack if the stack hasn't reached the `maxSize`.
- `int pop()` Pops and returns the top of the stack or returns `-1` if the stack is empty.
- `void increment(int k, int val)` Increments the bottom `k` elements of the stack by `val`. If there are less than `k` elements in the stack, increment all elements in the stack.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Behavior of Full Stack:** When the stack reaches its `maxSize`, should we ignore further push requests? 
    - **Answer:** Yes, further push requests should be ignored.
2. **Return Value of `pop()` on Empty Stack:** When the stack is empty and we call `pop()`, should it return `-1`?
    - **Answer:** Yes, it should return `-1`.
3. **Increment Operation on Less Than `k` Elements:** If the stack has less than `k` elements, should all elements be incremented?
    - **Answer:** Yes, all elements should be incremented.

### Strategy

1. **Class Structure:** Create a `CustomStack` class that encapsulates the stack's functionality.
2. **Push Operation:** Add an element to the stack only if the stack's size is less than `maxSize`.
3. **Pop Operation:** Remove and return the last element from the stack, or return `-1` if the stack is empty.
4. **Increment Operation:** Use a loop to increment the first `k` elements (or all if fewer than `k` elements exist).

### Code

```javascript
class CustomStack {
    constructor(maxSize) {
        this.stack = [];  // initialize the stack with an empty array
        this.maxSize = maxSize;  // set the maximum size of the stack
    }

    push(x) {
        if (this.stack.length < this.maxSize) {  // only add if stack is not full
            this.stack.push(x);
        }
    }

    pop() {
        if (this.stack.length === 0) {  // check if stack is empty
            return -1;
        }
        return this.stack.pop();
    }

    increment(k, val) {
        let limit = Math.min(k, this.stack.length);  // determine how many elements to increment
        for (let i = 0; i < limit; i++) {
            this.stack[i] += val;  // increment each of the first `limit` elements
        }
    }
}

// Example usage:
// let customStack = new CustomStack(3); // Stack is Empty []
// customStack.push(1);    // stack becomes [1]
// customStack.push(2);    // stack becomes [1, 2]
// console.log(customStack.pop()); // return 2 --> Return top of the stack 2, stack becomes [1]
// customStack.push(2);    // stack becomes [1, 2]
// customStack.push(3);    // stack becomes [1, 2, 3]
// customStack.push(4);    // Stack still [1, 2, 3] as push does nothing
// customStack.increment(5, 100); // stack becomes [101, 102, 103]
// customStack.increment(2, 100); // stack becomes [201, 202, 103]
// console.log(customStack.pop()); // return 103 --> Return top of the stack 103, stack becomes [201, 202]
// console.log(customStack.pop()); // return 202 --> Return top of the stack 202, stack becomes [201]
// console.log(customStack.pop()); // return 201 --> Return top of the stack 201, stack becomes []
// console.log(customStack.pop()); // return -1 --> Stack is empty return -1.
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Push Operation:** O(1) - Constant time complexity for adding to the stack.
2. **Pop Operation:** O(1) - Constant time complexity for removing the top element.
3. **Increment Operation:** O(k) - Linear time complexity proportional to `k`, or the size of the stack, whichever is smaller.

By following this strategy, we've ensured that the stack operations are efficient and the stack operates within the constraints provided.
