[Leetcode 743. Network Delay Time](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l743)
## Problem Statement

You are given a network of `n` nodes, labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given `times`, a list of travel times as directed edges `times[i] = (ui, vi, wi)`, where `ui` is the source node, `vi` is the target node, and `wi` is the time it takes for a signal to travel from source to target. You are also given an integer `k`, representing the starting node.

Return the amount of time it takes for all the `n` nodes to receive the signal. If it is impossible for all the `n` nodes to receive the signal, return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can there be multiple edges between two nodes?
   - Typically, there may be multiple edges, but each edge (ui, vi) will have a distinct travel time `wi`.

2. Is it guaranteed that all `n` nodes are reachable from the starting node `k`?
   - No, if a node is not reachable from `k`, then we should return `-1`.

3. Can the travel times be negative?
   - No, all travel times are positive integers.

4. Should we consider the graph as directed or undirected?
   - The graph is directed as given in `times`.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path from the starting node `k` to all other nodes. We then determine the maximum time needed for the signal to reach any node.

### Steps:
1. Represent the times as an adjacency list.
2. Use a priority queue (min-heap) to repeatedly update the shortest time to each node.
3. If during processing, we reach all nodes, return the maximum of the shortest times.
4. If there is a node we can't reach, return `-1`.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} times
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var networkDelayTime = function(times, n, k) {
    const adjList = new Map();
    
    // Build the adjacency list
    for (const [u, v, w] of times) {
        if (!adjList.has(u)) adjList.set(u, []);
        adjList.get(u).push([v, w]);
    }
    
    const minHeap = new MinPriorityQueue({priority: x => x[1]});
    minHeap.enqueue([k, 0]);
    const dist = Array(n + 1).fill(Infinity);
    dist[k] = 0;
    
    while (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
        const [u, d] = minHeap.dequeue().element;
        
        if (d > dist[u]) continue;  // This is an outdated entry
        
        if (adjList.has(u)) {
            for (const [v, w] of adjList.get(u)) {
                if (dist[u] + w < dist[v]) {
                    dist[v] = dist[u] + w;
                    minHeap.enqueue([v, dist[v]]);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Extract the max distance
    let maxDist = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (dist[i] === Infinity) return -1;  // If we have any node that is not reachable
        maxDist = Math.max(maxDist, dist[i]);
    }
    
    return maxDist;
};
```

## Time Complexity

- Building the adjacency list takes `O(E)`, where `E` is the number of edges.
- The Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm using a min-heap takes `O((E + V) log V)`, where `V` is the number of vertices and `E` is the number of edges.

Overall, the time complexity is `O((E + V) log V)`.
