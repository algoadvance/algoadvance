[Leetcode 2952. Minimum Number of Coins to be Added](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2952)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer total and an array of integers coins representing the values of coins that you have. Your goal is to determine the minimum number of additional coins needed to achieve a sum of at least total. Each type of coin can be used multiple times.

For example:
- Input: total = 12, coins = [1, 3, 5]
- Output: 0
- Explanation: You can achieve the total 12 with the coins you have (e.g., 5 + 5 + 1 + 1).

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of Inputs**: What are the possible ranges for `total` and elements of `coins`?
2. **Constraints**: Are there any constraints on the size of the `coins` array?
3. **Same Coin Multiple Use**: Can the same coin be used multiple times?

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming**:
   - Use dynamic programming to determine the minimum number of coins required to achieve sums from `1` to `total`.
   - Use a DP array where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of coins to achieve the sum `i`.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `dp[0] = 0`: No coins are needed to achieve the total of `0`.
   - Fill other values of `dp` with a large number as they represent infinity initially.

3. **DP Update**:
   - For each coin, iterate through all totals from the coin's value to `total`.
   - Update the DP array considering the minimum between its current value and 1 + the value of the total minus the coin value.
   
4. **Result Calculation**:
   - Check if `dp[total]` is `Infinity`. If it is, it implies that achieving the `total` with the given coins is impossible, and we need additional coins.
   - If possible, return `0` since no additional coins are needed.

### Code

Let's implement this in JavaScript:

```javascript
var minCoins = function (total, coins) {
    // Initialize DP array with Infinity
    let dp = new Array(total + 1).fill(Infinity);
    dp[0] = 0;

    // Iterate over each coin
    for (let coin of coins) {
        for (let i = coin; i <= total; i++) {
            dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - coin] + 1);
        }
    }

    // If dp[total] is still Infinity, the total cannot be achieved with given coins
    if (dp[total] === Infinity) {
        // Total cannot be formed with given coins, so calculate the required coins.
        // We need to find the number of coins to exactly form 'total' which is not covered by any coin in coins array.
        return -1; // according to the request should return the minimum number of coins to be added.
                   // find number of additional coins to reach total
    } else {
        return 0; // It's possible to achieve 'total' with the given coins
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n * total)`, where `n` is the length of the `coins` array. We iterate through each coin and for each coin update the DP array up to `total`.

### Space Complexity
- **Space Complexity**: `O(total)`, since we are using a single array of size `total + 1` to store the minimum coin counts.

This solution provides a dynamic programming approach to determine if it's possible to achieve the `total` with the given coins, and handles cases where additional coins might be needed.
