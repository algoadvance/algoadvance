[Leetcode 3177. Find the Maximum Length of a Good Subsequence II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3177)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` of positive integers. A subsequence is considered "good" if it meets the following conditions:
1. The number of unique elements in the subsequence is at most `k`.

Find the maximum length of a "good" subsequence in `nums`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the input size?**
   - "k" is an integer representing the maximum number of unique elements allowed in the subsequence.
   - The length of `nums` (n) can be up to 10^5.
   
2. **What is the range of values for elements in `nums`?**
   - The elements are positive integers but there is no explicit upper bound mentioned in the problem.

3. **Can we assume that the input will always be valid?**
   - Yes, we can assume that the input provided will always be valid according to the problem description.

## Strategy

1. **Sort the Array**: Sort `nums` so that we can greedily take the longest subsequences while ensuring the unique count is <= `k`.

2. **Use a Frequency Dictionary**: Track the frequency of each number using a dictionary.

3. **Iterate Over Sorted Array**: Traverse the sorted array and keep adding elements to the subsequence until adding a new type would exceed `k` unique elements. Use a set to track the unique elements currently in the subsequence.

4. **Track Maximum Length**: Maintain a counter for the maximum length of the subsequence containing at most `k` unique elements.

## Code

```javascript
function findMaxLengthOfGoodSubsequence(nums, k) {
  // Sort the nums array
  nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  
  // To keep track of frequencies
  const freq = new Map();
  
  // Variables to keep track of the number of unique elements and the current length of the subsequence
  let uniqueCount = 0;
  let maxLength = 0;
  
  // Traverse the sorted array
  for (let num of nums) {
    // If num is not in freq map, it means it is a new unique element
    if (!freq.has(num)) {
      uniqueCount++;
    }
    
    // Add num to the freq map or update its frequency
    freq.set(num, (freq.get(num) || 0) + 1);
    
    if (uniqueCount > k) {
      // If uniqueCount exceeds `k`, remove elements from start until it is within limit
      for (let [key, value] of freq.entries()) {
        if (value === 1) {
          freq.delete(key);
          uniqueCount--;
          if (uniqueCount <= k) break;
        } else {
          freq.set(key, value - 1);
        }
      }
    }
    
    // Calculate the current length of the subsequence
    let currentLength = 0;
    for (let value of freq.values()) {
      currentLength += value;
    }
    maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength);
  }
  
  return maxLength;
}

// Example Usage:
const nums = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3, 4];
const k = 2;
console.log(findMaxLengthOfGoodSubsequence(nums, k)); // Output should showcase the max length of good subsequence
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: Sorting the array takes \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Iteration**: Iterating over the array takes \(O(n)\).

Hence, the overall time complexity of this approach is \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sorting step. The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the additional space required for the frequency map.
