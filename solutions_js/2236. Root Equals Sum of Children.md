[Leetcode 2236. Root Equals Sum of Children](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2236)
### Problem Statement

Given a binary tree where the root node has a value and two child nodes, determine if the value of the root node is the same as the sum of the values of its two child nodes.

Specifically, you need to implement the function `checkTree(root)` where `root` is a node of the binary tree, and you should return `true` if `root.val` is equal to the sum of the values of `root.left.val` and `root.right.val`. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

To fully understand the problem, consider the following clarifications:

1. **What is the structure of the tree nodes?**
   The tree nodes are typically structured like this:
   ```javascript
   function TreeNode(val, left = null, right = null) {
       this.val = val;
       this.left = left;
       this.right = right;
   }
   ```
   
2. **What are the possible edge cases?**
   - The root node might not have both left and right children; however, based on the problem statement, we assume the root will always have both left and right children.
   - Values of the nodes can be negative or zero.

### Strategy

1. Check if both child nodes exist.
2. Compute the sum of the values of the left and right child nodes.
3. Compare the sum to the value of the root node.
4. Return `true` if they are equal, otherwise return `false`.

### Code

Here is the JavaScript function to solve the problem:

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = val;
 *     this.left = left === undefined ? null : left;
 *     this.right = right === undefined ? null : right;
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var checkTree = function(root) {
    if (!root || !root.left || !root.right) {
        return false;
    }
    return root.val === root.left.val + root.right.val;
};
```

### Time Complexity

The function performs a constant time check:

- **Time Complexity:** O(1) - The function performs a constant number of operations regardless of the input size.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) - No additional space is used apart from a few variables for the sum and comparisons.

This solution effectively meets the problem's requirements and efficiently checks whether the root node's value equals the sum of its children's values.
