[Leetcode 2856. Minimum Array Length After Pair Removals](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2856)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` of positive integers. In each operation, you can remove any pair of equal integers from the array. Determine the minimum length of the array after `n / 2` such operations, where `n` is the length of the array.

It guarantees that it is possible to do `n / 2` operations.

Example:
```
Input: nums = [1,3,3,3,2,2,2,2]
Output: 0
Explanation: After taking 4 pairs of 2 and 4 pairs of 3, the array will be empty.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the array guaranteed to have an even length?**
   Yes, the length of the array is implied to be even since we're expected to perform `n / 2` operations.

2. **Can the input array contain numbers other than integers?**
   No, the array will contain only positive integers as stated.

3. **What should be returned?**
   We need to return the minimum length of the array after performing the operations.

### Strategy

1. **Count Frequencies:** Use a map or object to count the frequency of each number in the `nums` array.
2. **Sort Frequencies:** Identify the pairs we can remove by considering the most frequent items first.
3. **Perform Removals:** Simulate the removal of pairs and track the remaining elements.
4. **Result Calculation:** The result will be the number of elements left after performing the `n / 2` operations.

### Code

```javascript
function minLengthAfterPairRemovals(nums) {
    // Count the frequency of each number in the array
    let freqMap = {};
    for (let num of nums) {
        freqMap[num] = (freqMap[num] || 0) + 1;
    }

    // Convert the frequency map to an array of frequencies
    let frequencies = Object.values(freqMap);
    
    // Sort the frequencies in descending order
    frequencies.sort((a, b) => b - a);

    let operations = nums.length / 2; // Total operations to perform
    let removed = 0; // Count of removed elements

    // Remove pairs
    for (let freq of frequencies) {
        if (operations > 0) {
            let pairsToRemove = Math.min(freq / 2, operations);
            removed += pairsToRemove * 2;
            operations -= pairsToRemove;
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }

    return nums.length - removed;
}

// Example Usage:
console.log(minLengthAfterPairRemovals([1,3,3,3,2,2,2,2])); // Output: 0
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Counting Frequencies:** O(n), where n is the length of the array.
2. **Sorting Frequencies:** O(m log m), where m is the number of unique elements in the array.
3. **Removing Pairs:** O(m), iterating over the frequency array.

Overall, the algorithm primarily depends on the sorting step, so the time complexity is **O(n + m log m)**. Given that m can be at most n (in the case all elements are unique), this simplifies to **O(n log n)** in the worst case.
