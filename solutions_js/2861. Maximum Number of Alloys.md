[Leetcode 2861. Maximum Number of Alloys](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2861)
### Problem Statement:

In this problem, you are given a number of types of metals, a blueprint for a number of metal rods, and the number of alloys you are allowed to make. Each blueprint provides a list of metals required to create one rod, and the quantity needed for each type of metal. Your task is to determine the maximum number of alloys you can create.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. How many types of metals are available?
2. What is the number of blueprints provided?
3. How is the quantity of metals provided (e.g., as an array of integers)?
4. Are there any constraints or edge cases we should be aware of (e.g., no alloys possible, some metals are always plentiful)?

With these questions, let's assume a base case understanding and structure our solution.

### Strategy:

1. Parse the input values: number of metals, number of blueprints, and the quantity of metals provided.
2. Iterate over each blueprint to determine the maximum number of rods/alloys that can be produced for that blueprint.
3. For each blueprint:
   - Check how many times each metal requirement can be met based on the available quantity.
   - The maximum number of rods you can produce for a specific blueprint is determined by the metal with the least number of times it can meet the requirement (due to its limited quantity).
4. Return the maximum number of rods/alloys that can be produced among all blueprints.

### Code:

```javascript
function maxNumberOfAlloys(metals, blueprints, quantities, alloysAllowed) {
    let maxAlloys = 0;

    for (const blueprint of blueprints) {
        let minAlloysPerBlueprint = Infinity;
        
        for (let i = 0; i < blueprint.length; i++) {
            let ableToProduce = Math.floor(quantities[i] / blueprint[i]);
            minAlloysPerBlueprint = Math.min(minAlloysPerBlueprint, ableToProduce);
        }
        
        maxAlloys = Math.max(maxAlloys, minAlloysPerBlueprint);
    }

    return Math.min(maxAlloys, alloysAllowed);
}

// Example usage:
const metals = 3;
const blueprints = [
    [1, 2, 3],
    [2, 2, 2], 
    [3, 1, 1]
];
const quantities = [10, 15, 20];
const alloysAllowed = 10;

console.log(maxNumberOfAlloys(metals, blueprints, quantities, alloysAllowed));  // Expected output based on provided quantities
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Iterating over blueprints:** O(B)
- **Iterating over metals within each blueprint:** O(M)
- Therefore, the total complexity is **O(B * M)** where B is the number of blueprints and M is the number of metal types within each blueprint.

This approach ensures that we efficiently determine the maximum possible alloys that can be produced while considering the given constraints.
