[Leetcode 1441. Build an Array With Stack Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1441)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array target and an integer n. In each step, you may perform either of the two operations:
- "Push": pushes an integer to the array from 1 to n.
- "Pop": removes the last element from the array.

The goal is to build the `target` array using operations from the range `1` to `n` inclusive. Return the operations required to build the target array. If it is possible to build the `target` array, return any sequence of operations that builds the target array.

Example:
```
Input: target = [1,3], n = 3
Output: ["Push","Push","Pop","Push"]

Input: target = [1,2,3], n = 3
Output: ["Push","Push","Push"]

Input: target = [1,2], n = 4
Output: ["Push","Push"]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Should we consider `target` array elements to be always in sorted order?
   - Yes, elements in the `target` array are always in ascending order.
   
2. Can `n` be smaller than the largest element in the `target` array?
   - No, `n` will always be greater than or equal to the largest element in the `target` array.

### Strategy
1. Initialize an empty `operations` array to store the sequence of operations.
2. Use a pointer to iterate through the `target` array.
3. Iterate from `1` to `n`:
   - If the current number is in the `target` array, perform a "Push" operation and move the target pointer to the next element.
   - If the current number is not in the `target` array, perform a "Push" operation followed by a "Pop" operation.
4. Return the `operations` array.

### Code

```javascript
function buildArray(target, n) {
    let operations = [];
    let targetIndex = 0;
    
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (targetIndex >= target.length) break;
        
        operations.push("Push");
        
        if (target[targetIndex] === i) {
            targetIndex++;
        } else {
            operations.push("Pop");
        }
    }
    
    return operations;
}

// Testing the function
console.log(buildArray([1, 3], 3)); // ["Push", "Push", "Pop", "Push"]
console.log(buildArray([1, 2, 3], 3)); // ["Push", "Push", "Push"]
console.log(buildArray([1, 2], 4)); // ["Push", "Push"]
console.log(buildArray([2, 3, 4], 4)); // ["Push", "Pop", "Push", "Push", "Push"]
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the input parameter and the upper bound of numbers to process. We iterate through each number from `1` to `n` once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m), where `m` is the length of the `target` array. The space is used to store the operations which include the sequence of "Push" and "Pop".
