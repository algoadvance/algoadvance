[Leetcode 2760. Longest Even Odd Subarray With Threshold](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2760)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `arr` and an integer `threshold`. A subarray is called **even odd** if it contains only even numbers at even indices and odd numbers at odd indices. Another condition is that all elements of the subarray are less than or equal to `threshold`. Return the length of the longest **even odd** subarray that satisfies these requirements.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input array be empty?
2. What are the constraints on the values of `arr` and `threshold`?
3. Should individual elements of `arr` be considered valid subarrays?
4. Are negative numbers included in `arr`?

### Example
Given:
- `arr = [4, 5, 2, 7, 8]`
- `threshold = 8`

The longest even odd subarray with elements less than or equal to the threshold is `[4, 5, 2, 7]`, which has a length of 4.

### Strategy
1. **Initialize variables**: Create variables to keep track of the longest valid subarray length (`maxLength`) and the current subarray length (`currentLength`).
2. **Iterate through the array**:
    - Check each element to see if it is below the threshold.
    - Check if the current element follows the even-odd pattern (even index even or odd index odd).
    - If both conditions are met, increment the `currentLength`.
    - If the conditions are not met, compare `currentLength` with `maxLength` and update if necessary, then reset `currentLength`.
3. **Update with the final check** to ensure the longest subarray ending at the last element is considered.

### Code
```javascript
function longestEvenOddSubarray(arr, threshold) {
    let maxLength = 0;
    let currentLength = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (arr[i] <= threshold && ((i % 2 === 0 && arr[i] % 2 === 0) || (i % 2 !== 0 && arr[i] % 2 !== 0))) {
            currentLength++;
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength);
        } else {
            currentLength = 0;
        }
    }

    return maxLength;
}

// Example usage:
let arr = [4, 5, 2, 7, 8];
let threshold = 8;
console.log(longestEvenOddSubarray(arr, threshold)); // Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity
- **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the input array `arr`. We are iterating through each element of the array once.
