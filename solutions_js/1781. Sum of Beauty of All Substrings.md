[Leetcode 1781. Sum of Beauty of All Substrings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1781)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters. The "beauty" of a substring is defined as the difference between the frequency of the most frequent and least frequent characters.

- For example, the beauty of substring "aaabc" is `3 - 1 = 2` (most frequent character is 'a', which appears 3 times, and the least frequent character is 'b' and 'c', which appear 1 time each).

Return the sum of the beauty of all of its substrings.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the maximum length of string `s`?
   - Up to 500 characters.

2. Are all characters in the string lowercase English letters?
   - Yes, the problem guarantees this.

3. Should we consider non-contiguous subsequences?
   - No, we should only consider substrings (contiguous subsequences).

## Strategy

1. Iterate over all possible substrings of the input string `s`.
2. For each substring, calculate the beauty:
   - Track the frequency of each character.
   - Find the maximum and minimum frequency with at least one occurrence.
3. Sum up all the beauties and return the result.

To make this efficient:
- Use a nested loop for generating substrings in `O(n^2)` complexity.
- Use an array to count character frequencies efficiently for each substring.
- Update frequencies and calculate beauty in `O(1)` for each modification in substring, leading to manageable complexity despite high potential substring count.

## Code

```javascript
function beautySum(s) {
    const n = s.length;
    let totalBeauty = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const freq = new Array(26).fill(0);
        
        for (let j = i; j < n; j++) {
            const charIndex = s[j].charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0);
            freq[charIndex]++;
            
            const nonZeroFreq = freq.filter(f => f > 0);
            const maxFreq = Math.max(...nonZeroFreq);
            const minFreq = Math.min(...nonZeroFreq);
            
            totalBeauty += (maxFreq - minFreq);
        }
    }

    return totalBeauty;
}
```

## Time Complexity

### Analysis

- The outer loop runs `n` times.
- The inner loop runs `n` times in the worst case for each iteration of the outer loop.
- Counting frequencies and calculating max/min frequencies involves up to `26` operations per inner loop iteration.

Thus, the time complexity is:
- **Outer loop:** `O(n)`
- **Inner loop:** For each step from i to j, in the worst case `O(n * 26) = O(n)`
  
Combined: `O(n) * O(n) = O(n^2)`

Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(n^2)` and space complexity is `O(1)`. This is efficient enough for the constraint `n` up to `500`.

This approach ensures we compute the beauty of all possible substrings iteratively and effectively.
