[Leetcode 2203. Minimum Weighted Subgraph With the Required Paths](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2203)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n` denoting the number of nodes. You are also given a 2D array `edges` where `edges[i] = [u, v, w]` represents a directed weighted edge from node `u` to node `v` with weight `w`. Furthermore, you are given three integers `src1`, `src2`, and `dest`.

Return the minimum weight of a subgraph that contains two paths:
1. A path from node `src1` to node `dest`.
2. A path from node `src2` to node `dest`.

If no such subgraph exists, return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What nodes can the edges contain?**
   - Nodes are integers ranging from `0` to `n-1`.

2. **Is there a possibility of negative weights?**
   - The problem statement does not specify, but typically, shortest path problems like this assume non-negative weights unless explicitly stated.

3. **Do we have to consider all nodes in the graph?**
   - Yes, all nodes from 0 to `n-1` are considered unless they are disconnected.

4. **If there are multiple paths between the nodes, do we consider the one with the smallest weight?**
   - Yes, we need to consider the smallest weighted paths.

## Strategy

To find the minimum weight subgraph that meets the required conditions, we can approach the problem in these steps:

1. **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: For this shortest path problem, we can use Dijkstraâ€™s Algorithm from three different starting points: `src1`, `src2`, and `dest`. We'll run it thrice to get the cost of reaching all nodes from `src1`, `src2`, and `dest` respectively.

2. **Reverse Edges**: Since we need to ensure paths from `src1`/`src2` to `dest`, but also need to optimize the subgraph, we should run Dijkstra on the graph with reversed edges starting from `dest`. This will give the shortest path from every node to `dest`.

3. **Summing Up the Costs**: By leveraging the above three runs of Dijkstra:
    - From `src1` to all nodes.
    - From `src2` to all nodes.
    - From `dest` to all nodes via the reversed edges.
   
   By summarizing these distances, we can find the minimum cost for each node being used as an intermediate node in paths starting from `src1`, `src2` to `dest`.

## Code

```javascript
const { MinPriorityQueue } = require('@datastructures-js/priority-queue');

const dijkstra = (n, edges, start) => {
    const adjList = Array.from({length: n}, () => []);
    for (const [u, v, w] of edges) {
        adjList[u].push([v, w]);
    }

    const distances = Array(n).fill(Infinity);
    distances[start] = 0;
    const pq = new MinPriorityQueue({ priority: x => x[0] });
    pq.enqueue([0, start]);

    while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
        const [currDist, u] = pq.dequeue().element;
        if (currDist > distances[u]) continue;

        for (const [v, w] of adjList[u]) {
            const newDist = currDist + w;
            if (newDist < distances[v]) {
                distances[v] = newDist;
                pq.enqueue([newDist, v]);
            }
        }
    }

    return distances;
};

const minimumWeight = (n, edges, src1, src2, dest) => {
    const normalGraphDistancesFromSrc1 = dijkstra(n, edges, src1);
    const normalGraphDistancesFromSrc2 = dijkstra(n, edges, src2);

    // Reverse the graph for distances to dest
    const reversedEdges = edges.map(([u, v, w]) => [v, u, w]);
    const reversedGraphDistanceFromDest = dijkstra(n, reversedEdges, dest);

    let minWeight = Infinity;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const totalDist = normalGraphDistancesFromSrc1[i] + normalGraphDistancesFromSrc2[i] + reversedGraphDistanceFromDest[i];
        minWeight = Math.min(minWeight, totalDist);
    }

    return minWeight === Infinity ? -1 : minWeight;
};

// Example usage:
const n = 6;
const edges = [
  [0, 2, 2],
  [0, 4, 4],
  [2, 4, 1],
  [2, 3, 4],
  [3, 5, 1],
  [4, 5, 2]
];
const src1 = 0;
const src2 = 3;
const dest = 5;

console.log(minimumWeight(n, edges, src1, src2, dest));
```

## Time Complexity

- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: O(E + V log V) for each run.
- **Total Runs**: We run Dijkstra 3 times.
- **Total Time Complexity**: O(3 * (E + V log V)) = O(E + V log V), as we're multiplying a constant factor.

This solution should be efficient given the constraints typically seen in interview problems.
