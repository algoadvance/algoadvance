[Leetcode 892. Surface Area of 3D Shapes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l892)
## Problem Statement
You are given a 2D array `grid` of size `n x n` representing a 3D shape formed by placing `n x n` cubes of side length 1 on a flat grid. Each cell `(i, j)` of `grid` represents a pillar of cubes stacked upwards that reaches a height of `grid[i][j]`.

The surface area is the total area of all the exposed surfaces on these stacked cubes.

You need to return the surface area of the 3D shape represented by the `grid`.

### Example:
```
Input: grid = [[2]]
Output: 10

Input: grid = [[1,2],[3,4]]
Output: 34
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of values for n and heights in the grid?**
   - Typically, constraints will ensure that n is up to 50 and height values of grid cells can be reasonably assumed to be non-negative integers.

2. **Can there be zeroes in the grid?**
   - Yes, the grid can have zeroes which mean no cubes at that grid cell location.

3. **Do we need to handle invalid inputs such as non-integer values or negative heights?**
   - For this problem, we'll assume all inputs are valid according to the problem constraints.

## Strategy
1. **Base Surface Area:** Each cube contributes 6 units of surface area if isolated.
2. **Reduction due to Adjacency:** For each pair of adjacent cubes, two surfaces will not be exposed and thus should be subtracted from the total.
3. **Calculations:**
   - Calculate the surface area for each cube pile.
   - Deduct the hidden areas due to adjacent cube issues both horizontally (left & right) and vertically (up & down).

## Code
```javascript
function surfaceArea(grid) {
    let n = grid.length;
    let area = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] > 0) {
                // top & bottom surfaces
                area += 2;
                // left surface
                area += i == 0 ? grid[i][j] : Math.max(0, grid[i][j] - grid[i - 1][j]);
                // right surface
                area += i == n - 1 ? grid[i][j] : Math.max(0, grid[i][j] - grid[i + 1][j]);
                // front surface
                area += j == 0 ? grid[i][j] : Math.max(0, grid[i][j] - grid[i][j - 1]);
                // back surface
                area += j == n - 1 ? grid[i][j] : Math.max(0, grid[i][j] - grid[i][j + 1]);
            }
        }
    }
    return area;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(surfaceArea([[2]])); // Output: 10
console.log(surfaceArea([[1,2],[3,4]])); // Output: 34
```

## Time Complexity
- The solution involves a double loop over an `n x n` grid.
- Each iteration performs a constant amount of work.
- Thus, the time complexity is \(O(n^2)\).

This approach ensures we account for all surfaces, including those covered by adjacent piles, leading to an efficient and accurate calculation of the surface area.
