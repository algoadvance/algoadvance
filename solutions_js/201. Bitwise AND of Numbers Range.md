[Leetcode 201. Bitwise AND of Numbers Range](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l201)
## Problem Statement
Given two integers `left` and `right` that represent the range `[left, right]`, return the bitwise AND of all numbers in this range, inclusive.

### Example:
```
// Example 1:
Input: left = 5, right = 7
Output: 4

// Example 2:
Input: left = 0, right = 0
Output: 0

// Example 3:
Input: left = 1, right = 2147483647
Output: 0
```

### Constraints:
- `0 <= left <= right <= 2^31 - 1`

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are the numbers guaranteed to be non-negative?
   - **A:** Yes, both `left` and `right` are non-negative integers.
2. **Q:** What should be returned when `left` equals `right`?
   - **A:** When `left` equals `right`, the output should be `left` since the range contains only one number.

3. **Q:** Can I assume that the inputs will always satisfy `0 <= left <= right`?
   - **A:** Yes, the problem constraints guarantee this relationship.

## Strategy
1. **Bitwise AND Mechanics:**
   - The common property of the bitwise AND (`&`) operation is that if any bit position contains a `0` in any of the numbers, the resultant bit at that position will also be `0`.
   - To find the common prefix of `left` and `right`, shift both numbers to the right until they are equal. This will remove the differing bits.
   - Shift the common prefix back to its original position to get the result.

2. **Steps:**
   1. Initialize a variable `shift` to count the number of shifts.
   2. While `left` is not equal to `right`:
      - Right shift both `left` and `right`.
      - Increment the `shift` counter.
   3. Left shift `left` by the number of shifts to obtain the final result.

## Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} left
 * @param {number} right
 * @return {number}
 */
var rangeBitwiseAnd = function(left, right) {
    let shift = 0;
    // Find the common prefix
    while (left !== right) {
        left >>= 1;
        right >>= 1;
        shift++;
    }
    // Shift the common prefix back to its original position
    return left << shift;
};

// Test cases
console.log(rangeBitwiseAnd(5, 7));      // Output: 4
console.log(rangeBitwiseAnd(0, 0));      // Output: 0
console.log(rangeBitwiseAnd(1, 2147483647)); // Output: 0
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(log(max(left, right))): The number of iterations in the while-loop is determined by the number of bits required to represent the larger of `left` or `right`.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1): We only use a handful of additional variables; thus, the space complexity is constant.
