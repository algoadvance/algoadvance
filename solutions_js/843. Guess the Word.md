[Leetcode 843. Guess the Word](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l843)
## Problem Statement

This is the problem from LeetCode #843. `Guess the Word`.

This is a guessing game with the following rules:

You are given an array of strings `wordlist` with length `N`, all of the same length `K`.

Your goal is to guess one word from the list.

You can call a method `guess(word)` which returns an integer `match`, where `match` indicates how many characters in your guessed word match the target word exactly in both position and value.

You have a maximum of 10 guesses to find the target word.

Implement a function `findSecretWord(wordlist, master)`, where `master` is an object with a method `guess(word)`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can I assume all strings in `wordlist` are unique?**
   - Yes, you can assume all strings in `wordlist` are unique.
2. **What is the length range of the words and the list itself?**
   - Generally, the length of the words (K) ranges from 1 to 10, and the list length (N) ranges from 1 to 100.

## Code
We need to implement the guessing strategy. A possible and simple strategy might be to guess words and gradually narrow down the list based on the feedback from the `guess` method.

Hereâ€™s how we might go about coding this:

```javascript
function findSecretWord(wordlist, master) {
    const n = wordlist.length;
    const k = wordlist[0].length;

    // Function to calculate the similarity between two words
    const match = (word1, word2) => {
        let matches = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < k; ++i) {
            if (word1[i] === word2[i]) matches++;
        }
        return matches;
    };

    for (let i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
        // Randomly guess a word from the wordlist.
        let guessIndex = Math.floor(Math.random() * wordlist.length);
        let guessWord = wordlist[guessIndex];
        
        // Obtain the match count using master.guess
        let matchCount = master.guess(guessWord);
        
        // If we guessed the word, matchCount will be k. (Problem will be over)
        if (matchCount === k) return;

        // Filter the wordlist based on the number of matching characters with the guessed word.
        let newWordlist = [];
        for (let word of wordlist) {
            if (match(word, guessWord) === matchCount) {
                newWordlist.push(word);
            }
        }
        wordlist = newWordlist;
    }
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Random Selection for Guessing**: Initially, pick a random word from the wordlist.
2. **Matching Function**: Define a helper function `match` to find out how many characters in two words are exactly the same in both position and value.
3. **Feedback and Filter**: Use the feedback from the master.guess, and filter out the wordlist to consider only the words matching the feedback count.
4. **Repeat**: Continue this process for up to 10 guesses or until the correct word is found.

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity for the filtering operation is O(N * K) for each guess, so in the worst case for 10 guesses, it would be O(10 * N * K), where N is the number of words and K is the length of each word.
