[Leetcode 1668. Maximum Repeating Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1668)
Certainly! Let's break this down step by step.

## Problem Statement

Given a string `sequence` and a string `word`, return the maximum number of times `word` can repeat in `sequence` such that `word * k` is a substring of `sequence`.

### Example
```text
Input: sequence = "ababc", word = "ab"
Output: 2

Input: sequence = "ababc", word = "ba"
Output: 1

Input: sequence = "ababc", word = "ac"
Output: 0
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `sequence` or `word` be empty?**
   - No. The problem assumes that both strings will be non-empty.
   
2. **What are the constraints on the length of `sequence` and `word`?**
   - Typically, constraints are given, but let's assume practical lengths for interview purposesâ€”`sequence` length up to a few thousand, and `word` length up to a few hundred.

3. **Are there special characters involved?**
   - Assume only lowercase English letters unless specified otherwise.

## Strategy
1. We need to find the maximum `k` such that `word` repeated `k` times (`word * k`) is a substring of `sequence`.
2. Start by checking small values of `k` and incrementally check larger values until `word * k` is no longer a substring of `sequence`.

### Steps
1. Initialize `k` to 0.
2. Incrementally check if `word.repeat(k+1)` is a substring of `sequence`.
3. Stop when the repeated word is no longer found in the `sequence`.

This incremental check ensures that we identify the maximum possible `k`.

## Time Complexity
- Let `m` be the length of `sequence` and `n` be the length of `word`.
- Since we are checking each increment of `k` and the check involves substring matching which itself is linear in complexity relative to `m` and the length of the substring, the worst-case time complexity is `O(m * k * n)`.
- In practical terms, due to early termination, it can be more efficient.

## Code

```javascript
function maxRepeating(sequence, word) {
    let k = 0;
    let repeatedWord = word;
    
    while (sequence.includes(repeatedWord)) {
        k += 1;
        repeatedWord = word.repeat(k + 1);
    }
    
    return k;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Initialization**: `k` starts at 0, and `repeatedWord` is initialized to `word`.
2. **Loop to Check Repeats**:
   - While `repeatedWord` is found within `sequence`, increase `k`.
   - Update `repeatedWord` to `word.repeat(k + 1)` for the next iteration.
3. **Return Result**: Finally, return `k` when the repeated word is no longer a substring of `sequence`.

This approach is straightforward and leverages JavaScript's `String.prototype.includes` method to check for substrings efficiently.
