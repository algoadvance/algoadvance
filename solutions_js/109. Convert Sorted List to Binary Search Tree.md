[Leetcode 109. Convert Sorted List to Binary Search Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l109)
### Problem Statement
Convert a sorted singly linked list to a height-balanced binary search tree (BST).

A height-balanced binary tree is defined as a binary tree in which the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than 1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the expected input and output?**
   - **Input:** A singly linked list where the nodes are sorted in ascending order.
   - **Output:** A height-balanced binary search tree.

2. **Are there any constraints on the size of the linked list?**
   - Generally, there is no constraint on the size, but the problem should handle large lists efficiently.

3. **Should the BST be perfectly balanced?**
   - No, it should be height-balanced, not necessarily perfectly balanced.

### Strategy
1. **Understanding the Problem:**
   - A sorted linked list can easily be converted to a balanced BST using the middle element as the root. This splits the list into two halves, which recursively follow the same process for each half.

2. **Steps to Solve the Problem:**
   - Find the middle element of the linked list. This will become the root of the BST.
   - Recursively find the middle of the left half to construct the left subtree.
   - Recursively find the middle of the right half to construct the right subtree.

3. **Finding the Middle Element:**
   - Use the slow and fast pointer technique where the slow pointer advances one step while the fast pointer advances two steps. When the fast pointer reaches the end, the slow pointer will be at the middle.

4. **Recursive Approach:**
   - Define a helper function to handle the conversion recursively.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - An empty list should return `null`.
   - A list with one element should return a tree with that one element as the root.

### Code
```javascript
// Definition for singly-linked list.
function ListNode(val) {
    this.val = val;
    this.next = null;
}

// Definition for a binary tree node.
function TreeNode(val) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = this.right = null;
}

const sortedListToBST = function(head) {
    if (!head) return null;

    const findMiddle = (start) => {
        let slow = start;
        let fast = start;
        let prev = null;

        while (fast && fast.next) {
            prev = slow;
            slow = slow.next;
            fast = fast.next.next;
        }

        // Disconnect the left half from the mid node.
        if (prev) prev.next = null;

        return slow;
    };

    const convertListToBST = (start) => {
        if (!start) return null;

        const mid = findMiddle(start);
        const node = new TreeNode(mid.val);

        // If the middle node is the same as the start node, it means we have only one element.
        if (mid === start) return node;

        node.left = convertListToBST(start);
        node.right = convertListToBST(mid.next);

        return node;
    };

    return convertListToBST(head);
};
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Finding the middle:**
   - Each step to find the middle element runs in O(N) where N is the number of elements in the list segment.
2. **Recursive Splitting:**
   - Each split reduces the problem size approximately by half, leading to a balanced binary tree. The height of the tree is O(log N), resulting in recursion depth of O(log N).

Overall, the time complexity for this approach is O(N log N), dominated by the multiple splitting (each O(N)) across O(log N) levels.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity primarily results from the recursive stack depth which is O(log N). The space used for the tree nodes is O(N), but in terms of extra space, it's O(log N).
