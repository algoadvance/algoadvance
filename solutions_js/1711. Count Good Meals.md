[Leetcode 1711. Count Good Meals](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1711)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `deliciousness` where `deliciousness[i]` is the deliciousness of the i-th meal. You will choose two different meals to form a good meal. A good meal is defined as a pair of meals where the sum of their deliciousness values is a power of two.

Return the number of different good meals you can form. Since the answer can be large, return it modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values in the `deliciousness` array?**
   - Each element in the `deliciousness` array will have a value between 0 and \(2^{20}\).

2. **How long can the `deliciousness` array be at most?**
   - The length of the `deliciousness` array can be up to \(10^5\).

3. **Do we need to consider each pair of meals only once irrespective of their order?**
   - Yes, (i, j) and (j, i) are considered the same and should only be counted once.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Powers of Two:**
   - First, identify all possible powers of two up to the maximum possible sum of the most delicious meals, i.e., \(2 \times 2^{20}\).

2. **Use a Hash Map:**
   - Utilize a hash map (or object) to keep track of the occurrences of each deliciousness value we encounter as we iterate through the array.

3. **Count Pairs:**
   - For each meal, check if it can pair with any existing meal (that we have already accounted for in the hash map) to make a sum that is a power of two.
   - Update the count with the number of valid pairs.

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Since results can be large, take the result modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Code

```javascript
const countPairs = (deliciousness) => {
    const MOD = 1e9 + 7;
    const powerOfTwo = [];
    for (let i = 0; i <= 21; i++) {
        powerOfTwo.push(2 ** i);
    }

    let count = 0;
    const map = new Map();

    for (const value of deliciousness) {
        for (const power of powerOfTwo) {
            const complement = power - value;
            if (map.has(complement)) {
                count = (count + map.get(complement)) % MOD;
            }
        }
        map.set(value, (map.get(value) || 0) + 1);
    }

    return count;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n \* k), where `n` is the number of elements in the `deliciousness` array and `k` is the number of powers of two we are considering (which is constant at 22).

- **Space Complexity:** O(n), for storing the counts of each deliciousness value in the hash map.
