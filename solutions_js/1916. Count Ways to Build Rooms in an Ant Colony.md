[Leetcode 1916. Count Ways to Build Rooms in an Ant Colony](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1916)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer `n`, which represents the total number of rooms in an ant colony, and an array `prevRoom` of size `n` where `prevRoom[i]` indicates the room that needs to be built before building room `i`. Room `0` is the starting room and does not require any previous room to be constructed. You need to find out the number of ways to build all the rooms modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of values for `n`? 
   - The problem typically ensures `1 <= n <= 1000`.
   
2. What values can `prevRoom` contain?
   - The values in `prevRoom` will be between `-1` and `n-1`. Note that `prevRoom[0]` should be `-1`, indicating no previous room is needed for room 0.

## Strategy
1. **Topological Sort**:
    - We need to process the rooms in an order such that for each room `i`, the room `prevRoom[i]` is processed before `i`.
  
2. **Dynamic Programming**:
    - Use dynamic programming to keep track of the number of ways to build rooms.
    - Use a combination formula and factorials to handle computations efficiently.

3. **Image Room Construction as a Tree**:
    - Treat `prevRoom` relationships as a tree where each room points to its predecessor.
    - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to find the number of ways to complete subtrees rooted at each room.

4. **Combinatorics**:
    - Apply combinatorial mathematics to calculate the valid permutations of subtree constructions.

## Code Implementation

```javascript
const MOD = 10**9 + 7;

function countWays(n, prevRoom) {
    const fact = new Array(n + 1).fill(1);
    const invFact = new Array(n + 1);
    
    // Calculate factorial
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        fact[i] = (fact[i - 1] * i) % MOD;
    }
    
    // Calculate modular inverse of factorial using Fermat's Little Theorem
    invFact[n] = power(fact[n], MOD - 2, MOD);
    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        invFact[i] = (invFact[i + 1] * (i + 1)) % MOD;
    }
    
    // Tree representation
    const tree = new Array(n).fill(0).map(() => []);
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        tree[prevRoom[i]].push(i);
    }
    
    function power(base, expo, mod) {
        let result = 1;
        while (expo > 0) {
            if (expo % 2 === 1) {
                result = (result * base) % mod;
            }
            base = (base * base) % mod;
            expo = Math.floor(expo / 2);
        }
        return result;
    }

    function dfs(node) {
        let totalWays = 1;
        let totalSize = 0;
        for (const child of tree[node]) {
            const [childWays, childSize] = dfs(child);
            totalWays = totalWays * childWays % MOD * invFact[childSize] % MOD;  // Consider permutations
            totalSize += childSize;
        }
        totalWays = totalWays * fact[totalSize] % MOD;
        return [totalWays, totalSize + 1];
    }

    return dfs(0)[0];
}

// Example usage:
const n = 5;
const prevRoom = [-1,0,1,2,0];
console.log(countWays(n, prevRoom)); // Output should be 8 (as per the problem example)
```

## Time Complexity
- Constructing the tree from `prevRoom` relationships: `O(n)`.
- Performing DFS with combinatorial calculations for each node: `O(n)`.
- Overall time complexity is `O(n)` making the solution efficient for the given constraints.
