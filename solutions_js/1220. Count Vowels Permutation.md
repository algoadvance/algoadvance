[Leetcode 1220. Count Vowels Permutation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1220)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, your task is to count how many strings of length `n` can be formed under the following rules:

1. Each character is a lower case vowel ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u').
2. Each vowel 'a' may only be followed by 'e'.
3. Each vowel 'e' may only be followed by 'a' or 'i'.
4. Each vowel 'i' may not be followed by another 'i'.
5. Each vowel 'o' may only be followed by 'i' or 'u'.
6. Each vowel 'u' may only be followed by 'a'.

Return the count of strings of length `n` that can be formed under these rules. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the expected range for the value of `n`? (This might affect the choice of algorithm if `n` is very large.)
2. Is the result expected to be returned modulo `10^9 + 7` in all circumstances?

## Strategy

To avoid recalculating the number of strings that can be formed repeatedly, we can use Dynamic Programming (DP).

1. Define a 2D DP array `dp` where `dp[i][c]` represents the number of strings of length `i` that end with the vowel `c`.

2. Initialize `dp[1][c] = 1` for all vowels `c`, because there is only one string of length 1 for each vowel.

3. For each length `i` from 2 to `n`, update the DP table based on the given rules:
   - `dp[i]['a'] = dp[i-1]['e']`
   - `dp[i]['e'] = dp[i-1]['a'] + dp[i-1]['i']`
   - `dp[i]['i'] = dp[i-1]['a'] + dp[i-1]['e'] + dp[i-1]['o'] + dp[i-1]['u']`
   - `dp[i]['o'] = dp[i-1]['i'] + dp[i-1]['u']`
   - `dp[i]['u'] = dp[i-1]['a']`

4. Sum up the values in the DP table for length `n` to get the total number of valid strings.

5. Return the result modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Code

```javascript
const countVowelPermutation = (n) => {
    const MOD = 1000000007;
    
    // Initial dp arrays
    let dp_a = 1, dp_e = 1, dp_i = 1, dp_o = 1, dp_u = 1;

    for (let length = 2; length <= n; length++) {
        let new_dp_a = (dp_e) % MOD; 
        let new_dp_e = (dp_a + dp_i) % MOD;
        let new_dp_i = (dp_a + dp_e + dp_o + dp_u) % MOD;
        let new_dp_o = (dp_i + dp_u) % MOD;
        let new_dp_u = (dp_a) % MOD;

        // update current dp values to new dp values
        dp_a = new_dp_a;
        dp_e = new_dp_e;
        dp_i = new_dp_i;
        dp_o = new_dp_o;
        dp_u = new_dp_u;
    }

    return (dp_a + dp_e + dp_i + dp_o + dp_u) % MOD;
};

// Example Usage
console.log(countVowelPermutation(1)); // Expected output: 5
console.log(countVowelPermutation(2)); // Expected output: 10
console.log(countVowelPermutation(5)); // Output depends on n value
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string. This is because we are computing the possible strings iteratively for each length from 2 to \(n\).

The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since we are only maintaining a fixed number of variables (one for each vowel) and updating them iteratively.
