[Leetcode 3120. Count the Number of Special Characters I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3120)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, you are tasked with counting and returning the number of special characters in the string. Special characters are defined as any character that is not a letter (a-z, A-Z) or a digit (0-9).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Will the input string contain spaces?
   - Can the input string be empty?
   
2. **Output Specification:**
   - Should the output be an integer representing the count of special characters?

Assuming that:
- The input string can contain spaces.
- The input string can be empty.
- We need to return the count of special characters as an integer.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate Through the String:**
   - Use a loop to traverse each character in the string.
   
2. **Check for Special Character:**
   - Determine if a character is a special character using a regular expression or character checks.
   
3. **Count Special Characters:**
   - Maintain a counter that increments whenever a special character is encountered.

4. **Return the Count:**
   - Return the final count after traversing the entire string.

### Code

Here's the JavaScript code to solve the problem:

```javascript
function countSpecialCharacters(s) {
    let specialCharCount = 0;
    const len = s.length;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < len; i++) {
        const char = s[i];
        if (!(/[a-zA-Z0-9]/.test(char))) {
            specialCharCount++;
        }
    }
    
    return specialCharCount;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(countSpecialCharacters("Hello, World! @2022")); // Output: 4
console.log(countSpecialCharacters("123abcXYZ")); // Output: 0
console.log(countSpecialCharacters("")); // Output: 0
console.log(countSpecialCharacters("!@#$%^&*()_+")); // Output: 12
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the input string. Since we are iterating over each character of the string exactly once, this is the best possible time complexity for this problem.
