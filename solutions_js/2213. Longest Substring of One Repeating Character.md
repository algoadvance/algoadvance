[Leetcode 2213. Longest Substring of One Repeating Character](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2213)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` and an array of strings `queries`. For each query in `queries`, you need to determine the length of the longest substring of `s` that consists of exactly one repeating character after performing certain operations specified in the queries.

Each element in `queries` is in the format `[char, index]`:
- `char` is a character to be inserted at `s[index]`
- You need to insert the character into the string `s` at the specified index `index`.
- After the insertion operation, determine the length of the longest substring of `s` that consists of exactly one repeating character.

Return an array where each element is the result of the corresponding query.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Does the `queries` array ensure valid indices that are within the current length of the string `s` before each operation?
2. Do we need to treat the string as mutable (i.e., each query builds upon the result of the previous one)?
3. Can we assume the maximum possible length for `s` and `queries`?
4. Should we consider overlapping substrings as separate?

### Strategy
1. Parse the string `s` and the `queries` array.
2. For each query, perform the insertion operation on the string `s`.
3. After each insertion, calculate the length of the longest substring of `s` that consists of exactly one repeating character.
4. Store the result of each query in a results array.

#### Steps:
1. Initialize an empty array `results` to store the results of each query.
2. Iterate over each query and perform the insertion.
3. After each insertion:
   - Calculate the longest substring where only a single character repeats.
   - Store this length in the `results` array.
4. Return the `results` array.

### Code
```javascript
function longestRepeating(s, queries) {
    // Helper function to get the longest repeating length
    function getLongestRepeating(s) {
        let maxLen = 0;
        let currentChar = s[0];
        let currentLen = 1;
        for (let i = 1; i < s.length; i++) {
            if (s[i] === currentChar) {
                currentLen++;
            } else {
                maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, currentLen);
                currentChar = s[i];
                currentLen = 1;
            }
        }
        // Handle the last sequence
        maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, currentLen);
        return maxLen;
    }

    const results = [];
    
    for (const query of queries) {
        const [char, index] = query;
        s = s.slice(0, index) + char + s.slice(index);
        results.push(getLongestRepeating(s));
    }
    
    return results;
}

// Example usage:
const s = "bbaaa";
const queries = [['a', 1], ['b', 2]];
console.log(longestRepeating(s, queries)); // Output: [4, 4]
```

### Time Complexity
- The insertion operation takes O(n) time where n is the length of the string.
- Calculating the longest substring takes O(n) time for each query.
- With `m` queries each on a string of maximum length `n`, the overall time complexity is O(m * n).
