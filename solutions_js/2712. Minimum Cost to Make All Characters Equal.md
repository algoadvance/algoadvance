[Leetcode 2712. Minimum Cost to Make All Characters Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2712)
### Problem Statement
You are given a string `s` such that all characters of `s` are either `'0'` or `'1'`. You can change any `'0'` to `'1'` or vice versa, but each change costs 1 unit. Your goal is to make all the characters in the string `s` the same, either all `'0'` or all `'1'`. Write a function `minCostToMakeEqual(s)` that returns the minimum cost required to achieve this.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the length range of the input string `s`?**
   - The string `s` can have any length from 1 to $10^5$.

2. **What kind of characters are present in the input string `s`?**
   - The string only contains characters `'0'` and `'1'`.

3. **Do we increase cost as we change the characters consecutively or just the cumulative cost matters?**
   - We only need the cumulative cost after all the necessary changes.

### Strategy
To minimize the cost, we need to count the number of `'0'`s and `'1'`s in the string:
1. **Count the occurrences of `'0'` and `'1'`**
   - If we decide to change all characters to `'0'`, the cost will be the number of `'1'`s.
   - If we decide to change all characters to `'1'`, the cost will be the number of `'0'`s.
2. **Compare the two costs** and return the smaller one.

### Code
```javascript
var minCostToMakeEqual = function(s) {
    let count0 = 0; // To count the number of '0's
    let count1 = 0; // To count the number of '1's
    
    // Traverse through the string and count '0's and '1's
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        if (s[i] === '0') {
            count0++;
        } else {
            count1++;
        }
    }
    
    // Minimum cost will be the lesser of count0 and count1
    return Math.min(count0, count1);
};

// Example usage:
console.log(minCostToMakeEqual("1101001")); // Output: 3
console.log(minCostToMakeEqual("000111"));  // Output: 3
console.log(minCostToMakeEqual("1111"));    // Output: 0
console.log(minCostToMakeEqual("0000"));    // Output: 0
```

### Time Complexity
The solution involves:
- A single pass over the string to count `'0'`s and `'1'`s.

Thus, the time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is efficient and suitable for the input size constraint.
