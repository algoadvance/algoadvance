[Leetcode 257. Binary Tree Paths](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l257)
## Problem Statement

You are given the root of a binary tree. You need to return all root-to-leaf paths in any order.

### Constraints:

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 100]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

### Example:

Given the following binary tree:

```
   1
 /   \
2     3
 \
  5
```

The output should be:
```
["1->2->5", "1->3"]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is a leaf node?**
   A leaf node is a node with no children.
   
2. **Could the tree have duplicated values?**
   Yes, there might be duplicated values.

3. **What should be the format of the output paths?**
   The paths should be strings in the format "a->b->c", where 'a', 'b', and 'c' are node values from the root to a leaf.

## Strategy

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS):** We'll use DFS to traverse the tree.
2. **Path Tracking:** Track the path as we go deeper into the tree.
3. **Leaf Nodes:** When a leaf node is reached, add the recorded path to the result list.
4. **Backtracking:** As we explore different paths, backtrack to previous nodes after recording paths.

## Code

```javascript
function binaryTreePaths(root) {
    let paths = [];
    
    function dfs(node, currentPath) {
        if (!node) return;

        currentPath += node.val;
        
        if (!node.left && !node.right) {
            paths.push(currentPath);
        } else {
            currentPath += '->';
            if (node.left) dfs(node.left, currentPath);
            if (node.right) dfs(node.right, currentPath);
        }
    }
    
    dfs(root, '');
    return paths;
}
```

## Explanation

1. Define an array `paths` to store all root-to-leaf paths.
2. Create a helper function `dfs(node, currentPath)`:
   - If the current node is `null`, simply return.
   - Append the current node's value to the path string.
   - If the node is a leaf node (no left or right child), add the path to `paths`.
   - Otherwise, append '->' to the path and recursively call the DFS function for the left and right children.
3. Initiate the DFS from the root node with an empty path.
4. Return the collected paths from the function.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)`, where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree. We visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(H)`, where `H` is the height of the tree. This is the space required for the recursion stack. In the worst-case scenario (unbalanced tree), `H` can be `N`.

This approach efficiently collects all root-to-leaf paths using a DFS traversal.
