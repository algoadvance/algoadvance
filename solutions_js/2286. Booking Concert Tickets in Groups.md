[Leetcode 2286. Booking Concert Tickets in Groups](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2286)
## Problem Statement

You are managing a popular concert venue. The venue consists of a long row of seats, each row having `m` seats where `m` is fixed. You need to build a booking system such that people can book seats in groups. The concert must provide the following functionalities:

1. `BookSeats(int k, int maxRow)`: Book `k` consecutive available seats in the row from row 0 to `maxRow` (inclusive) such that:
   - The whole group sits together, without empty seats in between.
   - A booking is always made in the row with the smallest index that can fit all `k` seats together.
   - Return the [row, index of the first booked seat in the row]. If the requested seats can't be booked, return [-1, -1].

2. `CollectToys(int k, int maxRow)`: Check whether there are at least `k` empty seats available between row 0 and `maxRow` (inclusive).
   - If the seats are available, return the total number of empty seats.
   - If not, return -1.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the rows of seats represented as a grid or single-dimensional data structure?
2. How are the seat indices counted, starting from 0 or 1?
3. Should we maintain state across multiple function calls for book and check?

## Strategy

### Class Initialization
- Create a class `BookingSystem` that initializes with `n` rows and `m` seats per row.
- Use an array to keep track of the number of available seats per row.

### BookSeats Method
- Iterate from row 0 to `maxRow`.
- For each row, check if there is a block of `k` consecutive available seats.
- If found, book those seats by updating the array and return the row index and starting seat index.
- Return `[-1, -1]` if no suitable seats found.

### CollectToys Method
- Iterate from row 0 to `maxRow`.
- Count the total number of free seats.
- Return the count if it meets or exceeds `k`.
- Return -1 if not enough seats are available.

### Time Complexity
- Both methods will have a time complexity of `O(n * m)`, where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of seats per row. This is assuming we might need to traverse and check each seat in the given range.

## Code

```javascript
class BookingSystem {
    constructor(n, m) {
        this.n = n;
        this.m = m;
        this.rows = new Array(n).fill(0).map(() => new Array(m).fill(true));
    }

    bookSeats(k, maxRow) {
        for (let row = 0; row <= maxRow; row++) {
            let consecutiveEmpty = 0;
            for (let seat = 0; seat < this.m; seat++) {
                if (this.rows[row][seat]) {
                    consecutiveEmpty++;
                } else {
                    consecutiveEmpty = 0; 
                }

                if (consecutiveEmpty === k) {
                    for (let i = seat - k + 1; i <= seat; i++) {
                        this.rows[row][i] = false;
                    }
                    return [row, seat - k + 1];
                }
            }
        }
        return [-1, -1];
    }

    collectToys(k, maxRow) {
        let totalEmptySeats = 0;
        for (let row = 0; row <= maxRow; row++) {
            for (let seat = 0; seat < this.m; seat++) {
                if (this.rows[row][seat]) {
                    totalEmptySeats++;
                }

                if (totalEmptySeats >= k) {
                    return totalEmptySeats;
                }
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }
}

// Example usage
let bookingSystem = new BookingSystem(5, 10);
console.log(bookingSystem.bookSeats(5, 2)); // books 5 seats in a row up to row 2
console.log(bookingSystem.collectToys(7, 3)); // counts empty seats up to row 3
```

### Explanation:
1. The constructor initializes the rows and seats as a 2D array.
2. `bookSeats` method finds and books `k` consecutive seats in the earliest possible row up to `maxRow`.
3. `collectToys` method counts the number of empty seats up to `maxRow` and checks if it satisfies `k`.

This implementation ensures all conditions are met and provides the required functionalities in an efficient manner.
