[Leetcode 1814. Count Nice Pairs in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1814)
## Problem Statement

We are given an array of integers `nums`. A pair `(i, j)` is called nice if the conditions `(nums[i] + rev(nums[j])) == (nums[j] + rev(nums[i]))` are satisfied, where `rev(x)` is the reverse of integer `x`. We need to return the number of nice pairs in the array.

For example:
- Input: `nums = [42,11,1,97]`
- Output: `2`
  
Explanation: The two nice pairs are (0, 1) and (3, 3).
  
## Clarifying Questions

1. Is there any constraint on the size of the array `nums`?
   - Typical constraints: `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
   
2. Can the elements of `nums` be negative or very large?
   - Typically, `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`, no negatives but can be large integers.
   
3. What should be the approach if no nice pairs are found?
   - We should return `0`.

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can reframe the condition `(nums[i] + rev(nums[j])) == (nums[j] + rev(nums[i]))`. This simplifies to checking if `nums[i] - rev(nums[i]) == nums[j] - rev(nums[j])`.

Hereâ€™s how we can approach this:
1. Create a function to reverse the digits of a number.
2. Use a hash map to keep track of the frequency of the differences `nums[i] - rev(nums[i])`.
3. Iterate through the array`nums`, and for each number, calculate the difference and check how many times that difference was encountered previously. This will help us count the nice pairs.

## Code

Here is the JavaScript implementation:

```javascript
function reverseNumber(num) {
    return parseInt(num.toString().split('').reverse().join(''), 10);
}

var countNicePairs = function(nums) {
    const MOD = 1000000007;
    let count = 0;
    const map = new Map();
    
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        const rev = reverseNumber(nums[i]);
        const diff = nums[i] - rev;
        
        if (map.has(diff)) {
            count = (count + map.get(diff)) % MOD;
            map.set(diff, map.get(diff) + 1);
        } else {
            map.set(diff, 1);
        }
    }
    
    return count;
};

// Example input
const nums = [42, 11, 1, 97];
console.log(countNicePairs(nums)); // Output: 2
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the array `nums`. The main operations are iterating through the array and handling map operations (get and set), which are O(1) on average.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the array `nums`. In the worst case, all the differences calculated are unique, requiring space proportional to the number of elements in the array.

This approach ensures that we calculate the number of nice pairs efficiently without having to resort to a nested loop, thereby keeping the time complexity linear.
