[Leetcode 692. Top K Frequent Words](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l692)
## Problem Statement
Given an array of strings `words` and an integer `k`, return the `k` most frequent words. The answer should be sorted by frequency from highest to lowest. When words have the same frequency, sort them lexicographically (alphabetically).

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the input array contain empty strings? 
   **A:** Generally, the data structure problems assume valid input, so you may not need to handle empty strings unless specified.
   
2. **Q:** Should the comparison for lexicographical order be case-sensitive?
   **A:** Usually, in such problems, it is case-sensitive unless specified otherwise.
   
3. **Q:** Are there constraints on the value of `k`?
   **A:** Typically, `k` will be a valid integer such that `1 <= k <= number of unique words`.

4. **Q:** What if there are fewer unique words than `k`?
   **A:** In that case, we would return as many words as there are unique words.

## Strategy
1. **Count Word Frequencies:** Use a hash map (`frequencyMap`) to count the frequency of each word in the `words` array.
2. **Create a List of Words:** Convert the keys of the `frequencyMap` to an array (`uniqueWords`), as we will need to sort these words.
3. **Sort the Words:**
   - First by frequency in descending order
   - Then lexicographically in ascending order for words with the same frequency
4. **Return the Top K Words:** Slice the sorted array to return the top `k` frequent words.

## Code
```javascript
function topKFrequent(words, k) {
    const frequencyMap = new Map();

    // Count the frequency of each word
    for (const word of words) {
        frequencyMap.set(word, (frequencyMap.get(word) || 0) + 1);
    }

    // Convert map keys (words) to an array for sorting
    const uniqueWords = [...frequencyMap.keys()];

    // Sort words by frequency and then lexicographically
    uniqueWords.sort((a, b) =>
        frequencyMap.get(a) === frequencyMap.get(b)
            ? a.localeCompare(b)
            : frequencyMap.get(b) - frequencyMap.get(a)
    );

    // Slice the top k elements
    return uniqueWords.slice(0, k);
}

// Sample Usage
const words = ["i", "love", "leetcode", "i", "love", "coding"];
const k = 2;
console.log(topKFrequent(words, k)); // Output: ["i", "love"]
```

## Time Complexity
- **Counting Frequencies:** Linear time, `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the `words` array.
- **Sorting:** Depends on the number of unique words, `m`. The sorting operation will generally take `O(m log m)`.
- **Overall:** The total time complexity is `O(n + m log m)`. Since `m` (unique words) â‰¤ `n` (total words), this is efficient for large inputs.
