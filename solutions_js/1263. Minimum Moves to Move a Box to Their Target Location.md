[Leetcode 1263. Minimum Moves to Move a Box to Their Target Location](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1263)
### Problem Statement
Given a `grid` of size `m x n` where each cell represents a free space ('0') or a wall ('#'). You are given `S` representing the starting position of a player, `B` representing the starting position of a box, and `T` representing the target position of the box. The player can move to adjacent free spaces and can push the box in the four allowed directions if the adjacent cell in that direction is not a wall and the cell after the box in that direction is also free. Your goal is to find the minimum moves required to move the box to the target position. If it's impossible to accomplish this task, return `-1`.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: grid = [ 
                ["#","#","#","#","#","#"],
                ["#","T","#","#","#","#"],
                ["#",".",".","B",".","#"],
                ["#",".","#","#",".","#"],
                ["#",".",".",".","S","#"],
                ["#","#","#","#","#","#"]
             ]
Output: 3
Explanation: We push the box from (3,3) to (2,3), then to (1,3), and finally to (1,1).
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the player move diagonally, or only in four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right)?
    - The player can move only in the four cardinal directions.
2. What should be done if the box starts at the target position?
    - If the box starts at the target position, the answer is `0`.
3. Are there any constraints on the grid size?
    - The grid will be of a moderate size typically fitting within competitive programming limits (e.g., 50x50).
4. Will the grid always have a valid solution? 
    - Not necessarily. The function should return `-1` when it's not possible to move the box to the target position.
    
### Strategy
This problem can be approached with a combination of BFS and multi-state tracking:
1. BFS can be used to simulate the possible moves of the player and the box.
2. The state can be defined as a tuple of `(player_position, box_position)`.
3. Enqueue initial states, and explore neighbouring states by simulating the player pushing the box.
4. Use a visited set to keep track of visited states to prevent cycles and redundant checks.

### Code

```javascript
function minPushBox(grid) {
    const directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]];

    const rows = grid.length;
    const cols = grid[0].length;

    let player, box, target;
  
    for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === 'S') player = [i, j];
            if (grid[i][j] === 'B') box = [i, j];
            if (grid[i][j] === 'T') target = [i, j];
        }
    }

    const canMove = (sr, sc, er, ec, bx, by) => {
        const queue = [[sr, sc]];
        const visited = new Array(rows).fill(0).map(() => new Array(cols).fill(false));
        visited[sr][sc] = true;
      
        while (queue.length) {
            const [r, c] = queue.shift();
            if (r === er && c === ec) return true;
            for (let [dr, dc] of directions) {
                const [nr, nc] = [r + dr, c + dc];
                if (
                    nr >= 0 && nr < rows && 
                    nc >= 0 && nc < cols && 
                    grid[nr][nc] === '.' && !visited[nr][nc] &&
                    !(nr === bx && nc === by)
                ) {
                    visited[nr][nc] = true;
                    queue.push([nr, nc]);
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    const queue = [[...player, ...box, 0]];
    const visited = new Set();
    visited.add(player.toString() + ',' + box.toString());

    while (queue.length) {
        const [pr, pc, br, bc, dist] = queue.shift();
        if (br === target[0] && bc === target[1]) return dist;

        for (let [dr, dc] of directions) {
            const nbr = br + dr, nbc = bc + dc;
            const nppr = br - dr, nppc = bc - dc;

            if (
                nbr >= 0 && nbr < rows && 
                nbc >= 0 && nbc < cols && 
                grid[nbr][nbc] !== '#' &&
                canMove(pr, pc, nppr, nppc, br, bc)
            ) {
                const newState = [br, bc, nbr, nbc];
                const stateKey = newState.toString();
                if (!visited.has(stateKey)) {
                    visited.add(stateKey);
                    queue.push([br, bc, nbr, nbc, dist + 1]);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return -1;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **BFS Traversal**: In the worst case, we visit each cell multiple times with different states of players and boxes. Hence, the complexity can be analyzed as `O(rows * cols * (rows * cols))` considering different position combinations.
- **Movement Check**: For checking valid movement from S to B's possible new position, we use BFS traversal which takes `O(rows * cols)` each time it's invoked.

Thus, the overall complexity would be approximately `O((rows * cols)^2)`.
