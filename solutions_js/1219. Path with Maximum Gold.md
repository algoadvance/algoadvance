[Leetcode 1219. Path with Maximum Gold](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1219)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` grid grid where each cell has an integer representing the amount of gold in that cell, `0` if it contains no gold. 

Your task is to return the maximum amount of gold you can collect under the following conditions:

1. Every time you are located in a cell, you will collect all the gold in that cell.
2. From your position, you can walk one step to the left, right, up, or down.
3. You can't visit the same cell more than once.
4. Never visit a cell with `0` gold.
5. You can start and stop collecting gold from any position in the grid that has some gold.

Constraints:
- `1 <= grid.length, grid[0].length <= 15`
- `0 <= grid[i][j] <= 100`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can I revisit a cell that I have already visited before?**
   - No, you cannot revisit a cell during the path.

2. **Where can I start collecting gold from?**
   - You can start from any cell that contains gold.

3. **Should I account for cells with `0` gold?**
   - No, you should not visit cells with `0` gold.

4. **Can I move diagonally?**
   - No, you can only move left, right, up, or down.

### Strategy

1. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Implement DFS to explore all possible paths starting from each cell that has gold. 
2. **Tracking Visited Cells**: Use a visited array or modify the original grid temporarily to track visited cells.
3. **Backtracking**: After exploring each path, revert the changes to the grid to allow other paths to be explored.
4. **Collecting Maximum Gold**: Keep a global maximum that updates if a larger amount of gold is collected in a path.

### Code

```javascript
const getMaximumGold = (grid) => {
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;
    
    let maxGold = 0;

    // Directions: right, down, left, up
    const dirs = [[0, 1], [1, 0], [0, -1], [-1, 0]];
    
    const dfs = (x, y, currentGold) => {
        maxGold = Math.max(maxGold, currentGold);

        for (const [dx, dy] of dirs) {
            const nx = x + dx;
            const ny = y + dy;
            
            if (nx >= 0 && nx < m && ny >= 0 && ny < n && grid[nx][ny] > 0) {
                const tmp = grid[nx][ny];
                grid[nx][ny] = 0; // mark as visited
                dfs(nx, ny, currentGold + tmp);
                grid[nx][ny] = tmp; // backtrack
            }
        }
    };
    
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] > 0) {
                const tmp = grid[i][j];
                grid[i][j] = 0; // mark as visited
                dfs(i, j, tmp);
                grid[i][j] = tmp; // backtrack
            }
        }
    }

    return maxGold;
};

// Example Usage
const grid = [
    [1, 0, 7],
    [2, 0, 6],
    [3, 4, 5],
    [0, 3, 0],
    [9, 0, 20]
];
console.log(getMaximumGold(grid)); // Output should be the maximum gold that can be collected
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O((m * n)^2)` - In the worst case, we start DFS from every cell that contains gold, and for each cell, we explore up to `m * n` cells.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(m * n)` - The recursion stack space in the worst case plus the space needed to store the current state of the grid.
