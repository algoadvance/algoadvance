[Leetcode 1478. Allocate Mailboxes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1478)
## Problem Statement
Given a list of houses represented as integers on a number line, we want to place mailboxes in such a way that the total distance between each house and its closest mailbox is minimized. You are given an array `houses` where `houses[i]` is the position of the ith house along a street, and an integer `k` representing the number of mailboxes.

**Objective**: Place the k mailboxes to minimize the sum of distances between each house and its closest mailbox.

### Example:
**Input**:
- `houses = [1, 4, 8, 10, 20]`
- `k = 3`

**Output**: 5

### Explanation:
- One optimal way to place the three mailboxes is at positions 1, 8, and 20, which would result in distances `0` (1-1), `0` (8-8), `0` (20-20), `5` (4-8), and `2` (10-8). The sum is `0+0+0+5+2=7`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the houses have repeated positions?
2. Are the houses always sorted in non-decreasing order?
3. What are the constraints on the length of `houses` and the value of `k`?

## Strategy
1. **Sorting**: First, sort the `houses` array (if it is not already sorted).
2. **Dynamic Programming**: Use dynamic programming to solve subproblems by storing the minimum distances for placing a certain number of mailboxes over subsets of houses.
3. **Prefix Sum Array**: Use a prefix sum array to quickly calculate the sum of distances.

### Plan
1. Sort the `houses` array.
2. Define a 2D DP array where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum distance for placing `j` mailboxes in the first `i+1` houses.
3. Use a prefix sum array to compute sums efficiently.
4. Loop through possible placements and update the DP table.
5. Extract the result from the DP table.

## Code

```javascript
function minDistance(houses, k) {
    houses.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    const n = houses.length;
    const dp = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(k + 1).fill(Infinity));
    const dist = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(0));

    // Calculate distance costs for all intervals [i..j]
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = i; j < n; j++) {
            const median = houses[Math.floor((i + j) / 2)];
            for (let t = i; t <= j; t++) {
                dist[i][j] += Math.abs(houses[t] - median);
            }
        }
    }

    // Initialize base case for 1 mailbox
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        dp[i][1] = dist[0][i];
    }

    // Fill in the DP table
    for (let j = 2; j <= k; j++) {
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (let m = 0; m < i; m++) {
                dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], dp[m][j - 1] + dist[m + 1][i]);
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[n - 1][k];
}
```

## Time Complexity
- Sorting step: \(O(n \log n)\)
- Pre-computation of distances: \(O(n^2)\)
- Filling the DP table: \(O(n^3)\)
Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n^3)\). This can be optimized further using more advanced techniques, but for now, this approach serves as a clear and correct solution for reasonably-sized input arrays.

This approach ensures clarity and correctness while focusing on minimizing the sum of distances using dynamic programming.
