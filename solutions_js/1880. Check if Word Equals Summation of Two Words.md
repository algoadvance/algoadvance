[Leetcode 1880. Check if Word Equals Summation of Two Words](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1880)
### Problem Statement
You are given three strings `firstWord`, `secondWord`, and `targetWord`, each consisting of lowercase English letters. 

To decode the strings into integers, 'a' is interpreted as 0, 'b' as 1, 'c' as 2, and so on up to 'z' which is interpreted as 25. 

The problem is to determine whether the summation of the decoded values of `firstWord` and `secondWord` equals the decoded value of `targetWord`.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: firstWord = "acb", secondWord = "cba", targetWord = "cdb"
Output: true
Explanation: The decoded value of "acb" is 021 (i.e. 21), 
"cba" is 210 (i.e. 210), and "cdb" is 231 (i.e. 231).
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the lengths of the words always the same?
   - No, the lengths of `firstWord`, `secondWord`, and `targetWord` could be different.
   
2. Do we have to handle any non-lowercase English letters or invalid inputs?
   - No, the inputs are guaranteed to be valid lowercase English letters.

### Strategy
1. Create a helper function to decode a given word into its numeric value:
   - Each character should be converted by subtracting the ASCII value of 'a' from the ASCII value of the character.
   - Join these values together to form the resultant number.
   
2. Use this helper function to decode `firstWord`, `secondWord`, and `targetWord` into numeric values.

3. Sum the decoded values of `firstWord` and `secondWord`, and check if it equals the decoded value of `targetWord`.

### Code
Here is the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} firstWord
 * @param {string} secondWord
 * @param {string} targetWord
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isSumEqual = function(firstWord, secondWord, targetWord) {
    const decode = (word) => {
        return Number(word.split('').map(char => char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)).join(''));
    }
    
    const firstNum = decode(firstWord);
    const secondNum = decode(secondWord);
    const targetNum = decode(targetWord);
    
    return (firstNum + secondNum) === targetNum;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(isSumEqual("acb", "cba", "cdb")); // output: true
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this solution is O(N), where N is the total number of characters in `firstWord`, `secondWord`, and `targetWord` combined. This is because each character needs to be processed once.
