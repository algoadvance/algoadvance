[Leetcode 2735. Collecting Chocolates](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2735)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `chocolates` where `chocolates[i]` represents the number of chocolates you have on the `i-th` day. You can choose to eat `k` chocolates every day, but you can only start eating any `k` chocolates from any day `i` and can only keep eating them each day after. The task is to determine if it's possible to collect `k` chocolates consecutively for all days starting from day `i` without missing any day after that.

For example:
- if `chocolates = [3, 4, 5, 6]` and `k = 3`, starting from day 0, you can collect 3 chocolates each day consecutively as all days have at least 3 chocolates.

Return `true` if you can collect `k` chocolates consecutively each day starting from some day `i` to the end, and `false` otherwise.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints**: 
   - What is the size range of the `chocolates` array?
   - What is the range of values for `k`?
   
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - Should we handle if `k` is greater than any number in the array?
   - Are all elements in the array guaranteed to be positive integers?

3. **Input Verification**:
   - Should we handle cases where the array might be empty?

## Strategy

1. **Iterate through the Array**: Start from each element of the array and check if it's possible to collect `k` chocolates from that day onwards consecutively.
2. **Check Remaining Days**: For each starting position `i`, check every day from `i` to end of array to ensure they have at least `k` chocolates.
3. **Output Result**: Return true if any such start position allows collecting `k` chocolates consecutively to the end, otherwise return false.

## Code

```javascript
function canCollectChocolates(chocolates, k) {
    for (let i = 0; i < chocolates.length; i++) {
        let valid = true;
        for (let j = i; j < chocolates.length; j++) {
            if (chocolates[j] < k) {
                valid = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (valid) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    return false;
}

// Example usage:
let chocolates = [3, 4, 5, 6];
let k = 3;
console.log(canCollectChocolates(chocolates, k)); // Output: true

chocolates = [1, 2, 2, 2];
k = 2;
console.log(canCollectChocolates(chocolates, k)); // Output: false
```

## Time Complexity

- Each element of the array is checked once as a potential starting point: `O(n)`.
- For each starting point, we might check up to `n` elements to verify consecutive days: `O(n)`.
- Hence, the time complexity is `O(n^2)` in the worst case.
- Space complexity is `O(1)` as we're not using any additional data structures.

This solution should be efficient for reasonably sized arrays, but large input sizes may necessitate optimization.
