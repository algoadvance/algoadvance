[Leetcode 2741. Special Permutations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2741)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of distinct integers, we need to return the number of special permutations of `nums`. A special permutation of `nums` is defined as follows:

- The array should be ordered in such a way that for every `i` (1 <= i < nums.length), either `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[i-1]` or `nums[i-1]` is divisible by `nums[i]`.

Return the total number of special permutations of `nums`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Are all integers in the array `nums` distinct?
   - What is the range of possible integers in the array `nums`?

2. **Output Format:**
   - Should the result be returned as an integer value?

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - How should the function handle edge cases such as an array with only one element?
   - What happens if there are no special permutations possible, should the function return 0?

## Strategy

To solve this problem:
1. **Backtracking Approach:** We will use backtracking to generate permutations of the array and check the condition for each permutation.
2. **Helper Function:** A helper function to check whether a permutation meets the “special” condition.
3. **Optimization:** Use memoization or pruning techniques to avoid redundant computations.

### Steps:
1. Generate all permutations of the array.
2. For each permutation, check if it satisfies the special condition.
3. Count all the permutations that meet the condition.

## Code

Here's a possible implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function specialPermutations(nums) {
    let count = 0;

    function isSpecial(permutation) {
        for (let i = 1; i < permutation.length; i++) {
            if (permutation[i] % permutation[i - 1] !== 0 && permutation[i - 1] % permutation[i] !== 0) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    function permute(arr, start) {
        if (start === arr.length) {
            if (isSpecial(arr)) {
                count++;
            }
            return;
        }
        for (let i = start; i < arr.length; i++) {
            [arr[start], arr[i]] = [arr[i], arr[start]]; // Swap
            permute(arr, start + 1);
            [arr[start], arr[i]] = [arr[i], arr[start]]; // Backtrack
        }
    }

    permute(nums, 0);
    return count;
}

// Example Usage
const nums = [2, 3, 6];
console.log(specialPermutations(nums));  // Output depends on the provided example
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity of this algorithm is `O(n!)` where `n` is the number of elements in the array `nums`. This is because we generate all permutations of the array, which are `n!` in number.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is `O(n)` due to the recursion stack used in the backtracking algorithm. Additionally, storing permutations temporarily also requires extra space.

In conclusion, this approach works well for relatively small input sizes due to the factorial time complexity. For large input sizes, optimizations and more efficient algorithms might be necessary.
