[Leetcode 2953. Count Complete Substrings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2953)
### Problem Statement
Given a string, return the number of complete substrings. A complete substring is defined as one that contains all 26 letters of the English alphabet at least once.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input constraints:** Are there any constraints on the length of the input string? 
   - For instance, can it be empty, and up to how many characters can it contain?
2. **Character set:** Can we assume the string consists of only lowercase English letters?
3. **Output Details:** Should the count include overlapping complete substrings or must each counted substring be mutually exclusive?

### Strategy
To solve this problem:

1. **Sliding Window Technique:** We will use a sliding window to efficiently check each possible substring of the input string.
2. **Character Counting:** Utilize a frequency counter to keep track of the number of unique characters in the current window.
3. **Check Completeness:** For a substring to be "complete," our counter must show that each of the 26 letters appears at least once.

### Code
Below is the JavaScript code to achieve the solution:

```javascript
function countCompleteSubstrings(s) {
    const requiredCharCount = 26; // Total unique letters in English alphabet
    let count = 0;

    for (let start = 0; start < s.length; start++) {
        let charSet = new Set();
        for (let end = start; end < s.length; end++) {
            charSet.add(s[end]);
            if (charSet.size === requiredCharCount) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
}

// Example Usage
let testString = "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzabcdefgh"; // this string should contain some complete substrings
console.log(countCompleteSubstrings(testString)); // Outputs the number of complete substrings
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of the above algorithm is **O(N^2)**, where \(N\) is the length of the string `s`. This is because we have nested loops: the outer loop iterates over each character starting point, and the inner loop iterates over the possible end points.
- The space complexity is **O(1)** (excluding the input and output) since the set used to track unique characters is limited to a constant size of 26 at most.

Note: The given solution is basic and may not be efficient for very large inputs due to its quadratic time complexity. For handling larger strings efficiently, advanced techniques such as more sophisticated sliding window and hash map optimizations may be required.
