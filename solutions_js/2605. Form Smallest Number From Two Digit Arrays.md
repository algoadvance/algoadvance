[Leetcode 2605. Form Smallest Number From Two Digit Arrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2605)
## Problem Statement

Given two arrays of digits (each array contains digits from 0 to 9), the task is to form the smallest possible number using digits from these arrays. You can only use digits that appear in both arrays or just one digit from either array if no common digit exists. The resulting number must not have leading zeros unless the number is exactly zero.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums1 = [4, 1, 3], nums2 = [5, 7, 1]
Output: 1

Input: nums1 = [3, 5, 2, 6], nums2 = [3, 1, 7]
Output: 3

Input: nums1 = [0, 5], nums2 = [3, 4]
Output: 3

Input: nums1 = [9, 0, 8], nums2 = [3, 5, 4]
Output: 3
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Digit Length**: Do both arrays always have a non-zero length?
   - **Answer**: Yes, both arrays will always have at least one digit.
   
2. **Unique Digits**: Can the digits in the arrays repeat?
   - **Answer**: Yes, digits can repeat but we only need to consider unique occurrences of each digit.

3. **Leading Zero**: How should we handle leading zeros?
   - **Answer**: The result should not have leading zeros, except for the number 0 itself.

4. **Output Requirement**: Should the output be a single number?
   - **Answer**: Yes, the output should be the smallest possible number formed from the given arrays.

## Strategy

1. **Identify Common Digits**: Check for any common digits between the two arrays. If common digits exist, return the smallest one.
2. **No Common Digits**: If there are no common digits, form the smallest possible two-digit number using the smallest digit from each array.
3. **Sorting**: Sort both arrays to easily identify the smallest digits.
4. **Comparison**: Compare and select the minimum possible value according to the above rules.

## Code

```javascript
function minNumber(nums1, nums2) {
    // Convert both arrays to sets to remove duplicate digits
    const set1 = new Set(nums1);
    const set2 = new Set(nums2);

    // Find the common digits
    const commonDigits = [...set1].filter(digit => set2.has(digit));

    // If there are common digits, return the smallest one
    if (commonDigits.length > 0) {
        return Math.min(...commonDigits);
    }

    // Sort both arrays to find the smallest digits
    nums1.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    nums2.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    // Form the possible two-digit numbers and select the smallest one
    const smallestNum1 = nums1[0];
    const smallestNum2 = nums2[0];

    return Math.min(parseInt(`${smallestNum1}${smallestNum2}`, 10), parseInt(`${smallestNum2}${smallestNum1}`, 10));
}

// Example usage:
console.log(minNumber([4, 1, 3], [5, 7, 1]));  // Output: 1
console.log(minNumber([3, 5, 2, 6], [3, 1, 7]));  // Output: 3
console.log(minNumber([0, 5], [3, 4]));  // Output: 3
console.log(minNumber([9, 0, 8], [3, 5, 4]));  // Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Set Conversion**: O(n + m) where n is the length of `nums1` and m is the length of `nums2`.
2. **Finding Common Digits**: O(min(n, m)).
3. **Sorting**: O(n log n + m log m).

Thus, the overall time complexity is approximately O(n log n + m log m), which is dominated by the sorting step.

This approach ensures we can confidently find the smallest number that can be formed as per the given rules.
