[Leetcode 2713. Maximum Strictly Increasing Cells in a Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2713)
## Problem Statement
Given an m x n integer matrix, return the maximum number of strictly increasing cells in a path in the matrix. Here, a path is a sequence of cells in which:
   1. The cells are connected horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
   2. The values in the cells are strictly increasing.

You need to determine the longest path that adheres to these conditions.

### Clarifying Questions
To understand the problem better, let's outline some clarifying questions:
1. **Are negative numbers or only positive numbers allowed in the matrix?**
   - Both negative and positive numbers are allowed.
2. **Are we allowed to visit the same cell more than once in the path?**
   - No, revisiting cells is not allowed in a single path.
3. **Can the path start from any cell in the matrix?**
   - Yes, the path can start from any cell.
4. **Are diagonal connections (e.g., from top-left to bottom-right) allowed as well?**
   - Yes, diagonal connections are permitted.

### Strategy
To efficiently solve the problem, we can use Dynamic Programming with memoization (Top-Down DP) as our strategy. Here is a detailed plan:

1. **Helper Function**: Create a helper function `dfs(i, j)` which will return the longest path starting from cell `(i, j)`.
2. **Memoization**:
   - Use a memoization table to store the results of subproblems (i.e., the longest path starting from each cell).
3. **Recurrence Relation**:
   - From the current cell `(i, j)`, try moving to all 8 permissible directions (horizontally, vertically, diagonally).
   - If a move leads to a cell with a strictly greater value, recursively compute the length of the path from that new cell.
4. **Maximize**:
   - Track the maximum path length encountered among all possible cells as starting points.

### Code
Here's the implementation of the strategy discussed above:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} matrix
 * @return {number}
 */
function maxIncreasingCells(matrix) {
    const rows = matrix.length;
    const cols = matrix[0].length;
    
    const directions = [
        [-1, 0], [1, 0], [0, -1], [0, 1], // horizontal and vertical moves
        [-1, -1], [-1, 1], [1, -1], [1, 1] // diagonal moves
    ];

    // Memoization table
    const dp = Array.from({ length: rows }, () => Array(cols).fill(-1));

    const dfs = (i, j) => {
        if (dp[i][j] !== -1) return dp[i][j];
        
        let maxLength = 1; // The path length starting from this cell itself

        for (let [di, dj] of directions) {
            const newRow = i + di;
            const newCol = j + dj;

            if (
                newRow >= 0 && newRow < rows && 
                newCol >= 0 && newCol < cols &&
                matrix[newRow][newCol] > matrix[i][j]
            ) {
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, 1 + dfs(newRow, newCol));
            }
        }

        return dp[i][j] = maxLength;
    };

    let result = 0; 

    for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            result = Math.max(result, dfs(i, j));
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The memoization ensures that each cell is computed at most once, making the time complexity \(O(m \times n)\), where `m` and `n` are the dimensions of the matrix.
- Each cell computation involves checking up to 8 possible directions, which is constant.
  
Thus, the overall complexity is \(O(m \times n)\).
