[Leetcode 2492. Minimum Score of a Path Between Two Cities](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2492)
## Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer `n` representing `n` cities numbered from `1` to `n`. You are also given a 2D array `roads` where `roads[i] = [a_i, b_i, score_i]` indicates that there is a bidirectional road between cities `a_i` and `b_i` with a score `score_i`. 

The score of a path between two cities is defined as the minimum score of all the roads in this path. An active path can be started from any city and can end in any city. 

Return the minimum possible score of a path between any two cities.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Clarification on "active path":**
   - So, an active path can involve any number of roads starting from any city to any other city?
   
   - **Answer**: Yes, a path can take any number of roads between any two cities, and you need to find the minimum possible score of a path between any two cities.
   
2. **Multiple Roads Between Cities:**
   - Are there potentially multiple roads between two cities?
   
   - **Answer**: No, the problem implies that there is at most one road directly connecting any two cities.
   
3. **Input Constraints:**
   - Can there be isolated cities with no connecting roads?
   
   - **Answer**: No, you can assume there is always a way to travel between any two cities.

## Strategy

1. **Graph Representation:**
   - Represent the cities and roads as a graph using an adjacency list.
   
2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Depth-First Search (DFS):**
   - Use BFS or DFS to explore the graph from any starting point.
   - Track the minimum score encountered during the traversal.
   
3. **Real-Time Minimum Score Tracking:**
   - As you traverse, keep a tracking variable to record the minimum score.

## Code Implementation

```javascript
var minScore = function(n, roads) {
    const graph = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () => []);
    
    // Build the graph
    for (let [a, b, score] of roads) {
        graph[a].push([b, score]);
        graph[b].push([a, score]);
    }
    
    // Function to perform BFS
    const bfs = (start) => {
        const visited = new Array(n + 1).fill(false);
        const queue = [start];
        visited[start] = true;
        let minScore = Infinity;

        while (queue.length) {
            const current = queue.shift();

            for (const [neighbor, roadScore] of graph[current]) {
                if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                    visited[neighbor] = true;
                    queue.push(neighbor);
                }
                minScore = Math.min(minScore, roadScore);
            }
        }
        return minScore;
    };
    
    // Start BFS from any node. For this example, we can start from node 1.
    return bfs(1);
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Graph Construction:**
  - O(n + m), where `n` is the number of cities and `m` is the number of roads.

- **BFS Exploration:**
  - O(n + m), each edge and node are visited once.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n + m). The space complexity is also O(n + m) to store the graph and visitation states.

This solution efficiently finds the minimum score of any path in the given graph representation.
