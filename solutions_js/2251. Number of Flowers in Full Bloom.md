[Leetcode 2251. Number of Flowers in Full Bloom](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2251)
## Problem Statement

We are given a list of flowers where each flower has a bloom and a wilt time. Additionally, we are given an array of time points. For each time point, we need to determine how many flowers are in full bloom at that specific time.

A flower blooms at the start of its bloom time and remains in full bloom until its wilt time (inclusive).

### Inputs:
- `flowers`: an array of `m` flowers where each flower is represented as an array of two integers `[start, end]`, which correspond to the start (bloom) time and end (wilt) time of the flower.
- `persons`: an array of `n` integers representing time points.

### Output:
- An array of `n` integers where the `i-th` integer represents the number of flowers in full bloom at the `i-th` time point in `persons`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the bloom and wilt times inclusive?**
   - Yes, bloom time and wilt time are inclusive.
2. **Is there an upper or lower limit for the values of bloom/wilt times?**
   - Assume reasonable limits as per standard constraints of competitive programming (e.g., 1 ≤ bloom/wilt ≤ 10^9).
3. **Can there be overlapping bloom/wilt times?**
   - Yes, multiple flowers can overlap in their bloom periods.
4. **Can the `persons` array contain duplicate values?**
   - Yes, `persons` may contain duplicate values.

## Strategy

1. **Range Events**:
   - Use an event-based approach to reduce overall complexity.
   - Create events for each flower's bloom (`start time`) and wilt (`end time + 1`). The `end time + 1` ensures the interval includes the `end time`.

2. **Sweep Line Algorithm**:
   - Sort the events.
   - Use a sweep line approach to count the intervals overlapping each time point.
   - Track currently active flowers using a counter.

3. **Counting for Persons**:
   - After processing all events, iterate through the `persons` timepoints.
   - For each person, determine the number of active flowers using the preprocessed event data.

## Code

Here is the proposed solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function fullBloomFlowers(flowers, persons) {
    let events = [];

    // Create events for bloom and wilt times
    for (let [start, end] of flowers) {
        events.push([start, 1]);      // Flower starts blooming
        events.push([end + 1, -1]);   // Flower stops blooming (end + 1)
    }

    // Sort events based on time, and in case of tie, process end event before start
    events.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0] || a[1] - b[1]);

    // Process events to get a timeline of active blooms
    let activeFlowers = 0;
    let timeline = new Map();

    for (let [time, inc] of events) {
        activeFlowers += inc;
        timeline.set(time, activeFlowers);
    }

    // Function to get the number of active flowers at a given time using timeline map
    function getActiveFlowersAtTime(personTime) {
        let keys = Array.from(timeline.keys());
        let lo = 0, hi = keys.length;

        while (lo < hi) {
            let mid = Math.floor((lo + hi) / 2);
            if (keys[mid] <= personTime) {
                lo = mid + 1;
            } else {
                hi = mid;
            }
        }

        return lo > 0 ? timeline.get(keys[lo - 1]) : 0;
    }

    // Calculate the result for each person's time point
    let result = persons.map(getActiveFlowersAtTime);
    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Event creation**: \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the number of flowers (two events per flower).
- **Sorting**: \(O(m \log m)\) - sorting the 2m events.
- **Timeline creation and querying**: \(O(m + n \log m)\) - linear scan for timeline creation and binary search for each person’s query.

Overall, the time complexity is \(O((m + n) \log m)\), which is efficient for large inputs.
