[Leetcode 1985. Find the Kth Largest Integer in the Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1985)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `nums` and an integer `k`. Each string in the array `nums` represents an integer without any leading zeros. Your task is to find the kth largest integer in the array `nums`.

Return the string that represents this integer.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Does the array contain only valid integer strings (i.e., no empty strings or non-numeric strings)?
2. Can the integer values be larger than what JavaScript's `Number` type can handle?
3. What are the constraints on the length of the array `nums` and the length of each string within the array?

## Example

```javascript
Input: nums = ["3", "6", "7", "10"], k = 4
Output: "3"

Input: nums = ["2", "21", "12", "1"], k = 3
Output: "2"
```

## Strategy

### Plan
1. Convert the array of strings into an array of BigInt, to handle very large numbers.
2. Sort the array in descending order based on their numeric values.
3. Return the element at the `k-1` position in the sorted array, as the array is 0-indexed.

### Key Points
- JavaScript can handle very large integers using `BigInt`.
- Ensure that the sort operation handles numerical comparison rather than lexicographical comparison.

## Code

```javascript
function kthLargestNumber(nums, k) {
    // Convert each string to BigInt for accurate numerical comparison and sorting
    const sortedNums = nums.map(BigInt).sort((a, b) => (b > a ? 1 : -1));

    // Return the kth largest number as a string
    return sortedNums[k - 1].toString();
}

// Example Usage
console.log(kthLargestNumber(["3", "6", "7", "10"], 4)); // Output: "3"
console.log(kthLargestNumber(["2", "21", "12", "1"], 3)); // Output: "2"
```

## Time Complexity
- Converting strings to BigInt: O(n), where `n` is the number of strings in the array.
- Sorting the array: O(n log n).
- The overall time complexity is O(n log n) due to the sorting operation.
