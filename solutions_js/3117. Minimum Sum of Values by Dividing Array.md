[Leetcode 3117. Minimum Sum of Values by Dividing Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3117)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of integers `nums`. You can select any integer from `nums` and divide it by any of its divisors greater than 1 (not necessarily distinct). You can perform this operation on each integer at most once. The task is to find the minimum possible sum of the elements in the array after performing the operation optimally.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can elements in `nums` be negative?** 
   - No, all elements are positive integers.
 
2. **What should be done if an element is 1 since its only divisor is 1 itself?**
   - If an element is 1, it does not change and remains 1.

3. **Is the array ordered?**
   - The array is not required to be ordered; the solution needs to handle it regardless of input order.

4. **Are there any constraints on the size of `nums` or the value of elements within it?**
   - The typical constraints for coding problems apply; letâ€™s assume `nums.length` can go up to \(10^5\) and each element in `nums` can go up to \(10^9\).

### Strategy
1. **Iterate through the array `nums`.**

2. **For each element:**
   - Calculate all possible divisors greater than 1.
   - Find the smallest possible quotient (i.e., the element divided by its largest divisor greater than 1).
   - Choose the largest divisor to minimize the value after the division.

3. **Sum the modified values and return the result.**

### Code

Here is the JavaScript implementation:

```javascript
function getDivisors(num) {
    let divisors = new Set();
    for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) {
        if (num % i === 0) {
            divisors.add(i);
            divisors.add(num / i);
        }
    }
    return Array.from(divisors);
}

function minSumAfterDivision(nums) {
    let minSum = 0;

    for (let num of nums) {
        let divisors = getDivisors(num);
        if (divisors.length > 0) {
            let maxDivisor = Math.max(...divisors);
            minSum += Math.floor(num / maxDivisor);
        } else {
            // If no divisors found, add the original number
            minSum += num;
        }
    }

    return minSum;
}

// Example usage
let nums = [12, 15, 7, 1];
console.log(minSumAfterDivision(nums));  // Output will be the minimum sum after optimal division
```

### Strategy Explanation
- **Divisor Calculation**: We need to find the divisors of each number efficiently. We get all potential divisors up to the square root of the number and their complementary divisors.
- **Choosing the Best Divisor**: Among the divisors, we pick the maximum one to get the smallest quotient after division.
- **Edge Case Handling**: For numbers that do not have any divisors other than the number itself (like primes), they remain unchanged.

### Time Complexity
- **Finding Divisors**: For each number, computing divisors takes \(O(\sqrt{num})\).
- **Overall Complexity**: If `n` is the number of elements in `nums` and the maximum number is `N`, the total complexity is \(O(n \cdot \sqrt{N})\), which is efficient for the given constraints.
