[Leetcode 2191. Sort the Jumbled Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2191)
### Problem Statement

You are given a permutation of the digits 0 to 9 as an integer array permutation (of length 10) where `permutation[i]` is the new digit you should transform the digit `i` into. You are also given an array `nums` of digits. 

Return the same array with its elements sorted in non-decreasing order and transformed based on the `permutation` array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What should be the range of the input array `nums`?
   - Is there a possibility of having an empty `nums` array or an invalid `permutation` array?

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Should the output be the transformed numbers sorted or should the transformed numbers be reverted back to their original values after sorting?

3. **Example:**
   - Let's consider permutation `permutation = [2,1,4,8,6,3,0,9,7,5]` and `nums = [990,332,981]`.
   - What should be the expected output of this example?

Once these are clarified, we can proceed to implement the solution.

### Strategy

1. **Transformation Function:**
   - First, create a function to transform a given number based on the `permutation` array.
   - For example, if the `permutation` array is `[2,1,4,8,6,3,0,9,7,5]` and the given number is `981`, the function should transform `9` to `5`, `8` to `7`, and `1` to `1`, resulting in the number `571`.

2. **Apply Transformation:**
   - Transform each number in the `nums` array using the function created.

3. **Sorting:**
   - Sort the transformed numbers.

4. **Output Original Numbers:**
   - Sort the original numbers based on the order of transformed numbers.

### Code

```javascript
function sortJumbled(permutation, nums) {
    // Transform a given number based on the permutation array
    function transformNumber(num) {
        return parseInt(
            num.toString().split('').map(digit => permutation[digit]).join('')
        );
    }

    // Create an array of { original, transformed } objects
    let transformedNums = nums.map(num => ({
        original: num,
        transformed: transformNumber(num)
    }));

    // Sort based on transformed values
    transformedNums.sort((a, b) => a.transformed - b.transformed);

    // Extract and return the original values in sorted order
    return transformedNums.map(item => item.original);
}

// Example usage:
let permutation = [2, 1, 4, 8, 6, 3, 0, 9, 7, 5];
let nums = [990, 332, 981];

console.log(sortJumbled(permutation, nums)); // Output: [332, 981, 990]
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Transformation:**
   - For each number, transforming it based on the permutation requires converting it to a string, then to an array, and mapping through it. This is linear with respect to the number of digits, i.e., O(k) where k is the number of digits.

2. **Sorting:**
   - The sorting algorithm has a time complexity of O(n log n) where n is the number of elements in the `nums` array.

Overall, the time complexity of the solution is O(n log n + nk), where n is the number of numbers in `nums` and k is the average number of digits per number.

This approach ensures that the `nums` array is sorted based on the transformed values and returned in the required order.
