[Leetcode 719. Find K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l719)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`, return the k-th smallest distance among all the pairs `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` where `i < j`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the values of the integers in the array?**
   - Typically constraints might be given, but if none are specified, we can assume standard limits for array size and integer values as per typical problem constraints.

2. **What is the length of the array `nums`?**
   - Example constraints may include 1 <= nums.length <= 10^4 and 0 <= nums[i] <= 10^6.

3. **Is the array sorted or unsorted?**
   - We may assume it's initially unsorted, and we need to sort it if required for the solution.

4. **Are there any edge cases we need to consider (e.g. all elements the same, minimal array length)?**
   - Weâ€™ll need to handle cases where all elements are the same or the length of the array is 2.

## Strategy

1. **Sort the Array:** Start by sorting the array. This helps in utilizing binary search efficiently.

2. **Binary Search on Answer:** Use binary search on the possible range of distances. The smallest possible distance is 0 (if there are duplicate numbers), and the largest possible distance is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.

3. **Count Pairs with Distance <= Mid:** For a given middle value during binary search, count the number of pairs whose distance is less than or equal to this middle value. This can be done efficiently using two-pointer technique:
    - Initialize two pointers, `i` and `j`. Move `j` to ensure the condition `nums[j] - nums[i] <= mid` holds, and count pairs.

4. **Adjust Binary Search:** Depending on the count obtained:
    - If the count is less than `k`, it means we need to search the larger part of distances.
    - If the count is greater than or equal to `k`, we search the smaller part.

## Code

```javascript
function smallestDistancePair(nums, k) {
    // Sort the array
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    // Binary search for the smallest distance
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums[nums.length - 1] - nums[0];

    const countPairs = (maxDistance) => {
        let count = 0;
        let j = 0;

        for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            while (j < nums.length && nums[j] - nums[i] <= maxDistance) {
                j++;
            }
            count += (j - i - 1);
        }

        return count;
    };

    while (left < right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        let count = countPairs(mid);

        if (count < k) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid;
        }
    }

    return left;
}

// Examples for testing:
console.log(smallestDistancePair([1, 3, 1], 1)); // Output: 0
console.log(smallestDistancePair([1, 1, 1], 1)); // Output: 0
console.log(smallestDistancePair([1, 6, 1], 3)); // Output: 5
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Sorting the array:** `O(n log n)`
2. **Binary search:** The range of potential distances spans from `0` to the difference between the maximum and minimum element, so the binary search part itself takes `O(log(max_distance))`, where `max_distance` is `max(nums) - min(nums)`.
3. **Counting pairs:** For each iteration in binary search, counting pairs takes `O(n)` using two pointers.

Combining these, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n + n log(max_distance))`. Given that `max_distance` could be linearly related to `n` in the worst case, the complexity simplifies asymptotically to `O(n log n)`.
