[Leetcode 2910. Minimum Number of Groups to Create a Valid Assignment](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2910)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of positive integers `tasks` where `tasks[i]` represents the number of tasks assigned to the `i-th` person. Each person must be assigned at least one task, and no two people can have the same number of tasks. 

You need to determine the minimum number of people required such that every person can be assigned a unique number of tasks. In other words, you need to find the minimum number of groups possible in such a way that each person in the group performs a unique number of tasks.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are the tasks always positive integers?
    - Yes.
2. Can there be multiple entries in the `tasks` array for a single person?
    - No, each entry in the `tasks` array represents the number of tasks assigned to a unique person.
3. Is there an upper limit to the value of `tasks`?
    - The problem does not specify an upper limit. The array values are constrained by typical integer limits in programming.
4. Is sorting the array allowed?
    - Yes, you can use any approach to solve the problem.

### Strategy
1. **Sort the tasks**: Sorting makes it easier to compare and check for uniqueness.
2. **Count unique frequencies**: Use a frequency count to determine how many times each unique number of tasks appears.
3. **Form groups**: For each task frequency:
   - If the frequency of a given number of tasks is more than one, calculate the number of additional groups needed.
   - Continue until all task assignments are unique.

### Code
Here is the JavaScript code to solve the problem:

```javascript
function minGroups(tasks) {
    // Edge case: if tasks array is empty
    if (tasks.length === 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    // Step 1: Sort the tasks array
    tasks.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    // Step 2: Use a map to track the frequency of each task count
    const frequencyMap = new Map();
    for (let task of tasks) {
        if (frequencyMap.has(task)) {
            frequencyMap.set(task, frequencyMap.get(task) + 1);
        } else {
            frequencyMap.set(task, 1);
        }
    }

    // Step 3: Calculate the minimum number of groups
    let groups = 0;
    const uniqueTasksSet = new Set();

    for (let [task, freq] of frequencyMap) {
        while (freq > 0) {
            let uniqueTask = task;
            // Find the next unique task number
            while (uniqueTasksSet.has(uniqueTask)) {
                uniqueTask += 1;
            }
            // Assign this unique task number
            uniqueTasksSet.add(uniqueTask);
            // Reduce the frequency count and increase groups count
            freq -= 1;
            groups = Math.max(groups, uniqueTasksSet.size);
        }
    }

    return groups;
}

// Example Usage:
console.log(minGroups([1, 1, 2, 3]));  // Output: 3
console.log(minGroups([1, 2, 3]));     // Output: 3
console.log(minGroups([3, 3, 3]));     // Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: \(O(N \log N)\), where \(N\) is the number of elements in `tasks`.
- **Frequency Mapping**: \(O(N)\), iterating through the array to fill the map.
- **Adjusting for Uniqueness**: \(O(N)\), iterating over the frequency map and adjusting task counts.

Overall, the time complexity of the solution is \(O(N \log N)\) primarily due to the sorting step.
