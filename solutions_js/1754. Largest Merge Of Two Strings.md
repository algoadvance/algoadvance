[Leetcode 1754. Largest Merge Of Two Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1754)
## Problem Statement

You are given two strings `word1` and `word2`. You want to construct a string `merge` by repeatedly picking characters from either `word1` or `word2` to maximize the lexicographical order of the resulting string.

Formally, choose one of the following options until you pick all characters from both strings:
- If `word1` is non-empty, pick the leftmost character of `word1`.
- If `word2` is non-empty, pick the leftmost character of `word2`.

Return the lexicographically largest `merge` you can construct.

### Example

```plaintext
Input: word1 = "cabaa", word2 = "bcaaa"
Output: "cbcabaaaaa"
Explanation: Pick from word1 to get "c", then pick from word2 to get "b", then pick from word1 to get "c", then pick from word1 to get "a" (4x) and word2 to get "a" (2x).
```

### Constraints

1. `1 <= word1.length, word2.length <= 3000`
2. `word1` and `word2` consist only of lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can both words be empty at any point? No, both words have at least one character until they are processed.
2. Are the words composed exclusively of lowercase characters? Yes.
3. Is the order of selection deterministic based on the lexicographical comparison? Yes.

## Code

```javascript
function largestMerge(word1, word2) {
    let merge = "";
    let i = 0, j = 0;

    while (i < word1.length || j < word2.length) {
        if (i < word1.length && (j >= word2.length || word1.substring(i) > word2.substring(j))) {
            merge += word1[i];
            i++;
        } else {
            merge += word2[j];
            j++;
        }
    }

    return merge;
}

// Example usage
console.log(largestMerge("cabaa", "bcaaa")); // Output: "cbcabaaaaa"
```

## Strategy

1. Initialize pointers `i` and `j` to 0 for iterating over `word1` and `word2`.
2. Use a loop to construct the `merge` string character-by-character:
   - Compare the current suffixes of `word1` starting from `i` and `word2` starting from `j`.
   - Append the larger lexicographic character to `merge` and move the corresponding pointer.
3. Once characters from one word are exhausted, append the remaining characters of the other word.

## Time Complexity

- Comparing substrings within the loop makes the algorithm computationally expensive in worst-case scenarios.
- In the worst case, it could approach `O(n^2)` complexity:
  - Each comparison of substrings potentially involves comparing nearly the entire remaining strings, especially when suffixes keep decreasing the number of comparisons linearly.
- However, whether we could optimize by other means or need such exact comparison depends largely on input constraints and practical performance during execution. Efficient implementation in the given length range should manage well.
