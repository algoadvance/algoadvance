[Leetcode 2414. Length of the Longest Alphabetical Continuous Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2414)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` consisting of lowercase letters, your task is to determine the length of the longest alphabetical continuous substring. An alphabetical continuous substring is a substring of `s` where the characters are arranged in a strictly increasing order (i.e., `a` followed by `b`, `b` followed by `c`, etc.).

### Example:
1. Input: `s = "abacaba"`
   Output: 2
   Explanation: The longest alphabetical continuous substrings are `"ab"` and `"bc"`, each of length 2.

2. Input: `s = "abcde"`
   Output: 5
   Explanation: The entire string "abcde" is the longest alphabetical continuous substring.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- `s` consists of lowercase English letters.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the string contain non-alphabetical characters?
   - No, the string will only consist of lowercase English letters.

2. Is the substring necessarily in strictly increasing order without any repetition?
   - Yes, the substring should contain characters in strictly increasing consecutive order.

## Strategy
1. Initialize variables to keep track of the current length of the increasing substring and the maximum length found so far.
2. Iterate through the string `s` starting from the second character.
3. For each character, check if it is the next character in alphabetical order from the previous character.
   - If it is, increase the current length counter.
   - If it isn't, compare the current length with the maximum length and update the maximum length if necessary. Then reset the current length counter.
4. After the loop, compare the current length with the maximum length one last time to account for the longest substring ending at the end of the string.
5. Return the maximum length found.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
var longestContinuousSubstring = function(s) {
    if (s.length === 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    let maxLength = 1;
    let currentLength = 1;

    for (let i = 1; i < s.length; i++) {
        // Check if the current character continues the strictly increasing sequence
        if (s.charCodeAt(i) === s.charCodeAt(i - 1) + 1) {
            currentLength++;
        } else {
            // Update maxLength and reset currentLength
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength);
            currentLength = 1;
        }
    }

    // Final check to ensure the last sequence is accounted for
    maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength);

    return maxLength;
};
```

### Time Complexity
The proposed solution involves a single pass through the string `s`, leading to a time complexity of O(n), where `n` is the length of the string.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) as we only use a constant amount of additional space for variables.
