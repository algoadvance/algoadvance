[Leetcode 540. Single Element in a Sorted Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l540)
### Problem Statement

Leetcode 540: Single Element in a Sorted Array

You are given a sorted array consisting of only integers where every element appears exactly twice, except for one element which appears exactly once. Find this single element that appears only once.

Your solution should run in O(log n) time and O(1) space.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,2,3,3,4,4,8,8]
Output: 2
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [3,3,7,7,10,11,11]
Output: 10
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length range of the input array?**
   - The array length will be in the range `[1, 10^5]`.

2. **Are there any constraints on the values of the integers in the array?**
   - The integers in the array are within the range `[-10^5, 10^5]`.

3. **Is the input always valid (i.e., always contains exactly one single element)?**
   - Yes, the input is always valid and always contains exactly one single element.

### Strategy

Given the constraints, an O(log n) solution indicates the use of binary search. The strategy includes:

1. Using binary search to continually split the array into halves.
2. Use the properties of indices to determine which half contains the single element.
3. Specifically, compare the mid index with its neighbors to determine if it is the single element.
4. Based on whether the halves on both sides of the mid element comply with expected pairing properties, adjust the search range.

### Code

```javascript
function singleNonDuplicate(nums) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = nums.length - 1;

    while (left < right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);

        // To ensure mid is even
        if (mid % 2 === 1) mid--;

        // Check the pair
        if (nums[mid] === nums[mid + 1]) {
            // Move the left pointer to mid + 2 because pair is valid
            left = mid + 2;
        } else {
            // Search in the left half
            right = mid;
        }
    }

    // When left meets right, that's the single element
    return nums[left];
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(log n)
  - The binary search logarithmically reduces the search range from n to 1.

- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Only a few extra variables are used, regardless of the input size.

This approach ensures we effectively utilize the sorted property and binary search to arrive at the solution within the desired time complexity.
