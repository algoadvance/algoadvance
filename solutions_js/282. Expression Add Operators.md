[Leetcode 282. Expression Add Operators](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l282)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `num` that contains only digits and an integer `target`, you need to return all the possible ways to add the binary operators `'+'`, `'-'`, or `'*'` between the digits of `num` so that the resultant expression evaluates to the target value.

### Constraints:
- 1 <= num.length <= 10
- `num` consists of only digits.
- No leading zeros are allowed.
- 1 <= target <= 2^31 - 1

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the numbers formed in the expressions have leading zeros?**
   - No, numbers in the expressions should not have leading zeros except for the number "0" itself.

2. **Is the given string num guaranteed to have valid digits only (0-9)?**
   - Yes, the string num will only contain digits from 0-9.

3. **Do we need to handle negative numbers as part of the num string?**
   - No, the input string `num` will not have any negative numbers, only digits.

## Strategy

We'll use backtracking to solve this problem:

1. **Backtracking Function**: Define a recursive function that keeps track of:
   - Current position in the string.
   - Current expression being formed.
   - Current calculated value of the expression.
   - Previous operand which is useful for handling multiplication.
   
2. **Base Case**: When we reach the end of the string:
   - Check if the calculated value matches the target.
   - If it matches, add the current expression to the result list.
   
3. **Recursive Case**:
   - Explore adding each possible operator (`+`, `-`, `*`) between the digits.
   - Handle leading zeros to ensure numbers like `05`, `012` are not considered.
   - For each recursive call, adjust the calculated value and previous operand accordingly.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Input num has only one digit.
   - Handling of large inputs up to 10 digits.

## Code

```javascript
var addOperators = function(num, target) {
    const result = [];
    
    const backtrack = (index, path, calc, tail) => {
        // Base case: if we have processed the entire string
        if (index === num.length) {
            // If current calculated value matches the target, add the expression to result
            if (calc === target) {
                result.push(path);
            }
            return;
        }
        
        for (let i = index; i < num.length; i++) {
            // Substring from current index to i (inclusive)
            const currStr = num.substring(index, i + 1);
            // Convert to number
            const currNum = Number(currStr);
            
            // Avoid number with leading zeros
            if (num[index] === '0' && i !== index) break;
            
            if (index === 0) {
                // First number, set it as the initial path
                backtrack(i + 1, currStr, currNum, currNum);
            } else {
                backtrack(i + 1, path + '+' + currStr, calc + currNum, currNum);
                backtrack(i + 1, path + '-' + currStr, calc - currNum, -currNum);
                backtrack(i + 1, path + '*' + currStr, calc - tail + tail * currNum, tail * currNum);
            }
        }
    };

    backtrack(0, "", 0, 0);
    return result;
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity is `O(4^n)`, considering there are `4` choices (no operator, `+`, `-`, `*`) at each position of the digits in the worst-case. This complexity accounts for the exponential nature due to the decisions made at each step.
   
However, practically it's faster since not all combinations are evaluated, but `O(4^n)` gives an upper bound.
