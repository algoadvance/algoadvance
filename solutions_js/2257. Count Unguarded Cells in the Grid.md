[Leetcode 2257. Count Unguarded Cells in the Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2257)
## Problem Statement

You are given a `m x n` grid, an array `guards` and an array `walls`. Each guard and each wall is a cell in the grid.

A cell is **guarded** if there is at least one guard that can reach it without any walls in the way. The guards can reach cells to the left, right, up, and down from their position.

Return the number of unguarded cells in the grid.

### Inputs:
- `m` (Integer): Number of rows in the grid.
- `n` (Integer): Number of columns in the grid.
- `guards` (Array of Arrays): Each sub-array contains two integers `[r, c]` representing the position of a guard.
- `walls` (Array of Arrays): Each sub-array contains two integers `[r, c]` representing the position of a wall.

### Outputs:
- Integer: Number of unguarded cells in the grid.

## Strategy

1. **Initialize the Grid**: Create a grid of size `m x n` and mark guards and walls.
2. **Mark Guarded Cells**: Using the positions of guards, mark the cells that are guarded by traversing in all four possible directions (left, right, up, down) until a wall or the edge of the grid is encountered.
3. **Count Unguarded Cells**: Traverse the grid and count the cells that are neither guarded nor walls nor guards.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can guards and walls share the same cell in the input?
   - No, the problem states that each guard and each wall is a cell, so they must be distinct.

2. How should we handle edge cases where `m` or `n` is zero?
   - If `m` or `n` is zero, there are no cells in the grid. Therefore, the number of unguarded cells is zero.

## Code

```javascript
function countUnguarded(m, n, guards, walls) {
    const grid = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(0));
    
    // Mark walls as -1 and guards as 1
    for (const [r, c] of guards) {
        grid[r][c] = 1;
    }
    
    for (const [r, c] of walls) {
        grid[r][c] = -1;
    }
    
    // Mark cells guarded by the guards
    function markGuarded(row, col, rowInc, colInc) {
        row += rowInc;
        col += colInc;
        while (row >= 0 && row < m && col >= 0 && col < n) {
            if (grid[row][col] === -1 || grid[row][col] === 1) {
                break; // Stop if a wall or a guard is encountered
            }
            grid[row][col] = 2; // Mark as guarded
            row += rowInc;
            col += colInc;
        }
    }
    
    // Iterate over all guards to mark guarded cells
    for (const [r, c] of guards) {
        markGuarded(r, c, -1, 0); // Up
        markGuarded(r, c, 1, 0); // Down
        markGuarded(r, c, 0, -1); // Left
        markGuarded(r, c, 0, 1); // Right
    }
    
    // Count unguarded cells
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === 0) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

// Example usage:
// m = 4, n = 6, guards = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,3]], walls = [[0,1],[2,2],[1,4]]
// Expected output: 7
console.log(countUnguarded(4, 6, [[0,0],[1,1],[2,3]], [[0,1],[2,2],[1,4]]));
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: O(m * n) to create and initialize the grid.
- **Mark Guards and Walls**: O(g + w), where g is the number of guards and w is the number of walls.
- **Mark Guarded Cells**: Each guard can potentially mark up to O(m + n) cells if there are no walls or other guards in the way. This results in O(g * (m + n)) complexity.
- **Count Unguarded Cells**: O(m * n) to iterate over the grid and count the unguarded cells.

Overall, the time complexity is O(m * n + g * (m + n)).
