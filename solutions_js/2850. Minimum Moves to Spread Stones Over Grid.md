[Leetcode 2850. Minimum Moves to Spread Stones Over Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2850)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D grid consisting of cells, where each cell contains either 0, 1, 2, ..., or 9 stones. Your objective is to redistribute the stones in such a way that each cell contains exactly one stone. Each move consists of transferring one stone from one cell to an adjacent cell (up, down, left, or right).

Write an algorithm to determine the minimum number of such moves required.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the dimensions of the grid specified?
   - Typically, the grid dimensions (m x n) would be provided. Assume m and n are given explicitly.
2. Can there be a case where achieving the goal is impossible?
   - Since all cells must eventually contain one stone, the total number of stones must equal the number of cells (m * n). This assumption is crucial for this problem to be solvable.
3. What are the constraints on the grid dimensions and stone counts?
4. How large can m and n be?
   - This typically impacts the choice of algorithm due to time complexity concerns.

### Strategy

The strategy involves identifying cells with surplus stones and cells lacking stones and then computing the minimal cost to transfer the stones appropriately. This problem can be approached with these steps:

1. **Identify Surplus and Deficit Cells**:
   - Traverse the grid to identify cells that have a surplus (stones > 1) and cells that have a deficit (stones < 1). 
   
2. **Compute Moves**:
   - Use a traversal algorithm (like BFS or DFS) to simulate the process of moving stones from surplus cells to deficit cells. Each move costs a unit distance between the cells (Manhattan distance).

3. **Optimization**:
   - Since brute-forcing each possible path may be infeasible for larger grids due to time constraints, using graph traversal techniques with priority queues can help optimize the moves based on Manhattan distance.

### Implementation in JavaScript

```javascript
function minMoves(grid) {
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;

    const surplus = [];
    const deficit = [];
    
    // Step 1: Identify surplus and deficit cells
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] > 1) {
                surplus.push([i, j, grid[i][j] - 1]); // surplus holds positions and excess stones
            } else if (grid[i][j] < 1) {
                deficit.push([i, j, 1 - grid[i][j]]); // deficit holds positions and needed stones
            }
        }
    }

    // Step 2: Calculate minimum moves
    let moves = 0;
    while (surplus.length > 0 && deficit.length > 0) {
        let [si, sj, sCount] = surplus.shift();
        let [di, dj, dCount] = deficit.shift();
        
        let transfer = Math.min(sCount, dCount);
        moves += (Math.abs(si - di) + Math.abs(sj - dj)) * transfer;

        if (sCount > transfer) {
            surplus.unshift([si, sj, sCount - transfer]);
        }
        
        if (dCount > transfer) {
            deficit.unshift([di, dj, dCount - transfer]);
        }
    }
    
    return moves;
}

// Example usage
const grid = [
    [0, 2, 0],
    [0, 0, 3],
    [2, 0, 0]
];
console.log(minMoves(grid)); // Expected output depends on the grid configuration
```

### Time Complexity

- **Grid Parsing**: O(m*n)
- **Balancing Surplus and Deficit**: O(S * D), where S is the number of surplus cells and D is the number of deficit cells. In a worst-case scenario, S and D can both be O(m*n).

The solution employs a greedy approach by optimizing the transfer based on immediate requirements, aiming for a direct and efficient move computation.

This strategy ensures the algorithm is feasible for reasonably sized grids as typically expected in an interview problem.
