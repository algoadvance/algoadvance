[Leetcode 888. Fair Candy Swap](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l888)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays `A` and `B` where `A[i]` represents the size of the `i-th` candy that Alice has and `B[j]` represents the size of the `j-th` candy that Bob has. Since they want to be fair, they would like to exchange values of candies by satisfying the following condition:

After the exchange, both Alice and Bob have the same total amount of candy.

You need to find the two integers `a` from `A` and `b` from `B` such that the total amount of candy that Alice would have after the exchange is equal to the total amount of candy that Bob would have after the exchange.

Return an array `answer` where `answer[0]` is the size of the candy in `A` that Alice must exchange, and `answer[1]` is the size of the candy in `B` that Bob must exchange. If there are multiple answers, you may return any one of them. It is guaranteed that at least one valid answer exists.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - 1 <= `A.length`, `B.length` <= 10000
   - 1 <= `A[i]`, `B[j]` <= 100000

2. **Output:**
   - An array of two integers `[a, b]`, where `a` belongs to `A` and `b` belongs to `B`.

3. **Can we assume that the input arrays are non-empty and that a valid solution always exists?**
   - Yes, there is always a valid solution.

### Strategy

We need to find two numbers `a` from `A` and `b` from `B` such that:
\[ \text{SumA} - a + b = \text{SumB} - b + a \]

Rearranging the terms, we get:
\[ 2(b - a) = \text{SumB} - \text{SumA} \]

Let:
\[ \text{Delta} = \text{SumB} - \text{SumA} \]

So:
\[ b - a = \frac{\Delta}{2} \]

Thus, we need to find pairs `(a, b)` such that:
\[ b = a + \frac{\Delta}{2} \]

To implement this, we can use a set to store the elements of `B` for quick lookup.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} A
 * @param {number[]} B
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var fairCandySwap = function(A, B) {
    const sumA = A.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);
    const sumB = B.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);
    const delta = (sumB - sumA) / 2;

    // Create a set for elements in B
    const setB = new Set(B);

    // Find and return the valid pair
    for (let a of A) {
        const b = a + delta;
        if (setB.has(b)) {
            return [a, b];
        }
    }
};

// Example Usage
let A = [1, 1];
let B = [2, 2];
console.log(fairCandySwap(A, B)); // [1, 2]

A = [1, 2, 5];
B = [2, 4];
console.log(fairCandySwap(A, B)); // [5, 4]
```

### Time Complexity

- Calculating the sums of `A` and `B`: \(O(n + m)\), where \(n\) is the length of `A` and \(m\) is the length of `B`.
- Creating the set for `B`: \(O(m)\).
- Iterating through `A` and checking for existence in the set: \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity of this approach is \(O(n + m)\).
