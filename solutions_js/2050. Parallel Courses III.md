[Leetcode 2050. Parallel Courses III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2050)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer `n`, which indicates that there are `n` courses labeled from `1` to `n`. You are also given a 2D integer array `relations` where `relations[j] = [prevCoursej, nextCoursej]`, denoting that course `prevCoursej` has to be taken before course `nextCoursej` can be taken (prerequisite relationship). Additionally, you are given an integer array `time` where `time[i]` denotes the number of months it takes to complete the `(i+1)`th course.

You need to find the minimum number of months required to complete all the courses if you can take multiple courses at the same time, but you must follow the given prerequisite relationships.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can there be prerequisite cycles in the input?
   - No, it is guaranteed that the graph represented by the prerequisites will be a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG).
2. What is the range of values for `n` and the length of `time` array?
   - `n` can go up to 5000.
   - The length of the `time` array will also be `n`.

### Strategy
1. **Topological Sorting:** Use Kahn's Algorithm (BFS) to perform a topological sort on the graph. This helps in processing each course after its prerequisites.
2. **Dynamic Programming:** Use an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum time required to complete course `i`, considering all its prerequisite courses.
3. **Adjacency list:** Build an adjacency list and an in-degree list to facilitate topological sorting.

### Procedure
1. Initialize an array `indegree` which tracks the number of prerequisites for each course.
2. Create an adjacency list to store the prerequisite relationships.
3. Initialize a queue with all courses that have `0` prerequisites.
4. Use a `dp` array where `dp[i]` is initialized to `time[i-1]` (since courses are 1-indexed in `relations`).
5. Process each course in topological order:
   - When processing course `u`, for each neighboring course `v` of `u`:
     - Update `dp[v]` as the maximum of its current value and `dp[u] + time[v-1]`.
     - Decrement the indegree of `v`.
     - If indegree of `v` becomes zero, add it to the queue.
6. The answer is the maximum value in `dp` array because we need to wait until the longest path in the DAG is completed.

### Code
```javascript
function minimumTime(n, relations, time) {
    let indegree = new Array(n).fill(0);
    let adj = new Array(n).fill(0).map(() => []);
    let dp = new Array(n).fill(0);

    // Build graph and indegree array
    for (let [prev, next] of relations) {
        adj[prev - 1].push(next - 1);
        indegree[next - 1]++;
    }

    // Initialize queue with nodes having 0 indegree
    let queue = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (indegree[i] === 0) {
            queue.push(i);
            dp[i] = time[i];
        }
    }

    // Topological sort using BFS
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        let u = queue.shift();

        for (let v of adj[u]) {
            dp[v] = Math.max(dp[v], dp[u] + time[v]);
            indegree[v]--;

            if (indegree[v] === 0) {
                queue.push(v);
            }
        }
    }

    // Return the maximum time to complete all courses
    return Math.max(...dp);
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Building the graph:** O(E), where E is the number of relations.
- **Topological sort and DP update:** O(V + E), where V is the number of courses.
- **Extracting the maximum from dp:** O(V).

So, the overall time complexity of the algorithm is **O(V + E)**, which is efficient given the constraints.
