[Leetcode 1800. Maximum Ascending Subarray Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1800)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of positive integers `nums`. Return the maximum possible sum of an ascending subarray in `nums`.

A subarray is defined as a contiguous sequence of numbers within an array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the length of `nums` be zero?**
   - No, the array will have at least one element.

2. **Can the array have negative numbers?**
   - No, the array contains only positive integers.

3. **What should be returned if the array contains just one element?**
   - The element itself, since it's the only subarray.

### Strategy

1. Initialize two variables: `current_sum` to store the sum of the current ascending subarray and `max_sum` to store the maximum sum encountered so far.
2. Iterate through the array, and for each element:
   - If the current element is greater than the previous element, add it to `current_sum`.
   - Otherwise, update `max_sum` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, and reset `current_sum` to the current element.
3. After the loop, make a final comparison between `max_sum` and `current_sum` to cover the scenario where the highest sum might be the last ascending subarray.
4. Return `max_sum`.

### Code

```javascript
function maxAscendingSum(nums) {
    let current_sum = nums[0];
    let max_sum = nums[0];
    
    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
            current_sum += nums[i];
        } else {
            max_sum = Math.max(max_sum, current_sum);
            current_sum = nums[i];
        }
    }
    
    max_sum = Math.max(max_sum, current_sum);
    
    return max_sum;
}

// Example Usage:
// console.log(maxAscendingSum([10, 20, 30, 5, 10, 50]));  // Output: 65
// console.log(maxAscendingSum([10, 20, 30, 40, 50]));     // Output: 150
// console.log(maxAscendingSum([12, 17, 15, 13, 10, 11, 12])); // Output: 33
// console.log(maxAscendingSum([100, 10, 1]));             // Output: 100
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the array. The algorithm makes a single pass through the array, performing constant-time operations at each iteration.
