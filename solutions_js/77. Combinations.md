[Leetcode 77. Combinations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l77)
## Problem Statement

Given two integers n and k, return all possible combinations of k numbers out of the range [1, n].

You may return the answer in any order.

### Example:
```javascript
Input: n = 4, k = 2
Output: [
 [2,4],
 [3,4],
 [2,3],
 [1,2],
 [1,3],
 [1,4]
]
```

### Constraints:
- 1 <= n <= 20
- 1 <= k <= n

## Clarifying Questions
1. Should the output be sorted in lexicographical order or any order is fine?
   - Any order is fine as per the problem statement.
2. Are there any specific edge cases to consider such as `k=0` or `n=0`?
   - Since the constraints ensure \( 1 \leq n \leq 20 \) and \( 1 \leq k \leq n \), no need to handle `k=0` or `n=0`.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a backtracking approach that systematically explores all possible combinations:
1. Start with the first number and try to build combinations by adding further numbers recursively.
2. Whenever a combination of length `k` is achieved, add it to the output list.
3. Use pruning to avoid generating invalid combinations (i.e., combinations with more than `k` items).
4. Ensure each number is only used once by progressively working through the list of numbers.

## Code
```javascript
function combine(n, k) {
    let result = [];
    backtrack(1, []);
    
    function backtrack(start, currentCombination) {
        if (currentCombination.length === k) {
            result.push([...currentCombination]);
            return;
        }
        
        for (let i = start; i <= n; i++) {
            currentCombination.push(i);
            backtrack(i + 1, currentCombination);
            currentCombination.pop();
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- Combinations require choosing `k` elements out of `n` which can be expressed as `C(n, k)`. The time complexity for generating combinations is `O(C(n, k) * k)` because each combination takes `O(k)` time to generate.
- The actual number of combinations `C(n, k)` is given by the binomial coefficient \( \binom{n}{k} \).
- In the worst case, this is `O((n choose k) * k)`. Given the constraints \( 1 \leq n \leq 20 \), this is manageable within typical interview environments.

This solution systematically generates all valid combinations and should be efficient given the small constraint.
