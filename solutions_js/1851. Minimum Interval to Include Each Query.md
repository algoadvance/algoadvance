[Leetcode 1851. Minimum Interval to Include Each Query](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1851)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D array of intervals where intervals[i] = [lᵢ, rᵢ] describes the iᵗʰ interval starting at lᵢ and ending at rᵢ (inclusive). The size of an interval is defined as the number of integers it contains, or more formally rᵢ - lᵢ + 1.

You are also given an array of queries, where queries[j] is the jᵗʰ query.

The answer to the jᵗʰ query is the size of the smallest interval i such that lᵢ ≤ queries[j] ≤ rᵢ. If no such interval exists, the answer is -1.

Return an array containing the answer to the jᵗʰ query for each j: an array of the same length as queries.

**Example:**
```
Input: intervals = [[1,4],[2,4],[3,6]], queries = [2,3,4,5]
Output: [3,3,3,4]
```

**Constraints:**
- 1 ≤ intervals.length ≤ 10⁵
- 1 ≤ queries.length ≤ 10⁵
- 1 ≤ lᵢ ≤ rᵢ ≤ 10⁷
- 1 ≤ queries[j] ≤ 10⁷

## Clarifying Questions
- What should be returned if no interval includes the query value? 
  - Return `-1` for such cases.
- Are the intervals always sorted? 
  - No, intervals are not necessarily sorted.
- Can there be duplicate queries in the input?
  - Yes, there could be duplicate queries.
  
## Strategy
1. **Sorting:** 
   - First, sort the intervals by their start point, and if two intervals have the same start point, sort them by the end point.
   - Also, sort the queries and while processing, keep track of their original index to restore the original order later.
2. **Processing Queries:**
   - Use a min-heap to keep track of the smallest interval that contains the current query.
   - For each query:
     - Add intervals to the heap if their start is ≤ current query.
     - Remove intervals from the heap if their end is < current query.
     - The smallest element in the heap that contains the query will give the result for that query.
3. **Result Construction:** 
   - Use the stored original indices to construct the final result array.

## Code
```javascript
var minInterval = function(intervals, queries) {
    // Sort intervals by start point, and if equal by end point
    intervals.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0] || a[1] - b[1]);

    // Queries with original indexes
    const queryWithIndex = queries.map((q, i) => [q, i]);
    queryWithIndex.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

    const result = new Array(queries.length).fill(-1);
    const minHeap = new MinPriorityQueue({ priority: x => x[1] - x[0] + 1 });

    let index = 0;
    for (const [query, originalIndex] of queryWithIndex) {
        // Add all intervals that start ≤ current query
        while (index < intervals.length && intervals[index][0] <= query) {
            minHeap.enqueue(intervals[index]);
            index++;
        }

        // Remove intervals from the heap that do not cover the query
        while (!minHeap.isEmpty() && minHeap.front().element[1] < query) {
            minHeap.dequeue();
        }

        if (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
            const interval = minHeap.front().element;
            result[originalIndex] = interval[1] - interval[0] + 1;
        }
    }

    return result;
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting Intervals:** \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Sorting Queries:** \(O(m \log m)\)
- **Processing Queries:** Each interval is added and removed from the min-heap at most once, leading to a time complexity of \(O((n + m) \log n)\)
  
**Overall Time Complexity:** \(O((n + m) \log n)\) where \(n\) is the number of intervals and \(m\) is the number of queries.

## Space Complexity
- **Min-Heap:** Maximum size could be \(n\) intervals, hence \(O(n)\).
- **Auxiliary Space:** \(O(n + m)\) for storing query indices and results.
