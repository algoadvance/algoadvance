[Leetcode 1444. Number of Ways of Cutting a Pizza](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1444)
### Problem Statement

You are given a rectangular pizza that consists of `a` and `b` (representing apples and blanks respectively) in each cell. You need to cut the pizza into several parts such that each part contains at least one 'a'. You need to determine the number of ways to cut the pizza into exactly `k` pieces. 

A cut refers to a horizontal or vertical cut that divides the current piece into two smaller ones. Your task is to return the total number of ways modulo `10^9 + 7`.

#### Example:
```plaintext
Input: ["A..","AAA","..."], k = 3
Output: 3
```

#### Constraints:
- The dimensions of the pizza are `1 <= rows, cols <= 50`.
- `1 <= k <= 10`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the pizza consist entirely of blanks?
   - **A:** While not stated explicitly, each part must contain at least one 'A', so a completely blank pizza should logically yield 0 ways.
  
2. **Q:** Are diagonally connected apples considered as part of the same piece?
   - **A:** No. Cuts are strictly horizontal or vertical.

### Strategy
The task is to figure out the number of ways to achieve exactly `k` cuts such that each resulting piece has at least one apple. A dynamic programming approach will be effective here due to the overlapping subproblems and optimal substructure properties.

#### Steps:
1. **Prefix Sum Array**: Construct a prefix sum array to quickly calculate the number of apples in any subrectangle.
2. **Dynamic Programming**: Define a DP table `dp[r][c][remain_cuts]` to denote the number of ways to cut the pizza starting from cell `(r, c)` with `remain_cuts` cuts left.
3. **Transitions**: Use the prefix sum array to determine valid horizontal and vertical cuts.

### Code

```javascript
const numOfWays = function(pizza, k) {
    const MOD = 10**9 + 7;
    const rows = pizza.length;
    const cols = pizza[0].length;
    
    // Create a prefix sum array to count the number of apples in any sub-rectangle
    const prefixSum = Array.from({ length: rows + 1 }, () => Array(cols + 1).fill(0));

    // Fill the prefix sum array
    for (let r = rows - 1; r >= 0; r--) {
        for (let c = cols - 1; c >= 0; c--) {
            prefixSum[r][c] = (pizza[r][c] === 'A' ? 1 : 0) 
                            + prefixSum[r][c + 1]
                            + prefixSum[r + 1][c]
                            - prefixSum[r + 1][c + 1];
        }
    }

    // Memoization to store intermediate results
    const memo = new Array(rows).fill(0).map(() => new Array(cols).fill(0).map(() => new Array(k).fill(-1)));

    const dp = (r, c, remainCuts) => {
        if (prefixSum[r][c] === 0) return 0; // No apples in this subrectangle
        if (remainCuts === 0) return 1; // No cuts left but there's at least one apple

        if (memo[r][c][remainCuts] !== -1) return memo[r][c][remainCuts];

        let ways = 0;

        // Horizontal cuts
        for (let nr = r + 1; nr < rows; nr++) {
            if (prefixSum[r][c] - prefixSum[nr][c] > 0) {
                ways = (ways + dp(nr, c, remainCuts - 1)) % MOD;
            }
        }

        // Vertical cuts
        for (let nc = c + 1; nc < cols; nc++) {
            if (prefixSum[r][c] - prefixSum[r][nc] > 0) {
                ways = (ways + dp(r, nc, remainCuts - 1)) % MOD;
            }
        }

        return memo[r][c][remainCuts] = ways;
    };

    return dp(0, 0, k - 1);
};
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Prefix Sum Calculation**: O(rows * cols): Each cell of the prefix sum array is computed in constant time based on already computed values.
2. **Dynamic Programming**: Each state `dp(r, c, remainCuts)` may need to look at up to `rows` or `cols` states. There are `O(rows * cols * k)` states with up to `O(rows + cols)` transitions.

Thus, the overall complexity is roughly O(rows * cols * k * (rows + cols)), which is feasible given the constraints.
