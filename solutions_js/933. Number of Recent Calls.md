[Leetcode 933. Number of Recent Calls](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l933)
## Problem Statement:

You have a `RecentCounter` class which counts the number of recent requests within a certain time frame.

Implement the `RecentCounter` class:

- `RecentCounter()` Initializes the `counter` with an empty requests list.
- `int ping(int t)` Adds a new request at time `t`, where `t` represents some time in milliseconds, and returns the number of requests that have happened in the past `3000` milliseconds (including the new request). Specifically, return the number of requests that have happened in the inclusive range `[t-3000, t]`.

It is guaranteed that every call to `ping` uses `t` in a strictly increasing order.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. What is the range of the input value `t`? 
   - Typically, t is a positive integer, and is given in milliseconds.
2. Is there an upper bound on the number of calls to `ping`?
   - There is no explicit upper bound mentioned, but it is expected to handle a reasonable number of calls efficiently.
3. Are there any constraints or limitations related to system performance?
   - The solution should be efficient enough to handle a large number of calls in a timely manner.

## Strategy:

1. Use a queue (FIFO) to keep track of the timestamps of the requests.
2. Each time we receive a new `ping(t)`, we'll add `t` to the queue.
3. We'll remove any timestamps from the front of the queue that are less than `t-3000` to ensure the queue only contains timestamps within the last 3000 milliseconds.
4. Finally, return the size of the queue, which represents the count of requests in the last 3000 milliseconds.

## Code:

```javascript
class RecentCounter {
    constructor() {
        this.queue = [];
    }

    ping(t) {
        // Add the new request
        this.queue.push(t);
        
        // Remove the requests that are beyond 3000 milliseconds from the current time
        while (this.queue[0] < t - 3000) {
            this.queue.shift();
        }
        
        // The length of the queue represents the number of recent requests
        return this.queue.length;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity:

- **Adding a request (ping) time complexity**: 
  - Pushing an element to the queue is \(O(1)\).
  - Removing elements from the queue (while loop) can be \(O(n)\) in the worst case, where \(n\) is the number of elements in the queue.
  - On average, the while loop should not remove too many elements in a single call, maintaining efficient performance (effectively amortized \(O(1)\) operations over multiple pings).

- **Overall time complexity**: 
  - Each `ping` operation is \(O(n)\) in the worst-case scenario when multiple old elements need to be purged, but generally it is efficient for ongoing usage.

This approach ensures that the class maintains efficient counting even with a potentially large number of pings, as the old requests are effectively managed.
