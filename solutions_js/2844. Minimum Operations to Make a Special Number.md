[Leetcode 2844. Minimum Operations to Make a Special Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2844)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `num` representing a large integer. The special number is any integer that ends with the digit '25', '50', '75', or '00'. You can perform the following operation on the string: 
- Choose one digit of the string and delete it.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make `num` a special number.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the length of the string `num`?**
   - No specific constraints given, but the string `num` can be very large.
   
2. **Can the string `num` contain leading zeros?**
   - No, the string represents a large integer, so there should be no leading zeros unless the number is "0".

3. **Is the string guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Typically, yes, since it represents a large integer.

4. **Are we allowed to rearrange the digits of the number, or can we only delete them?**
   - You can only delete digits; you cannot rearrange them.

Given these clarifications, let's move on to coding the solution.

### Strategy

1. **Edge Cases:** If the string length is less than 2, return -1 as we cannot form a special number.
2. **Search for Pairs:** Look for the endings '25', '50', '75', or '00' within the string by iterating from the end towards the beginning.
3. **Minimum Operations:** Calculate the minimum number of deletions required to form any of these endings.

### Code

```javascript
function minOperationsToMakeSpecialNumber(num) {
    const endings = ["25", "50", "75", "00"];
    let min_operations = Infinity;
    
    // Check each ending condition
    for (const ending of endings) {
        let j = ending.length - 1;
        let operations = 0;
        
        for (let i = num.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (num[i] === ending[j]) {
                j--;
                if (j < 0) {
                    break;
                }
            } else {
                operations++;
            }
        }
        
        if (j < 0) {
            min_operations = Math.min(min_operations, operations);
        }
    }
    
    return min_operations === Infinity ? -1 : min_operations;
}

// Example test cases
console.log(minOperationsToMakeSpecialNumber("2245047")); // Output: 2
console.log(minOperationsToMakeSpecialNumber("2908305")); // Output: 3
console.log(minOperationsToMakeSpecialNumber("10")); // Output: -1
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n \times m) \), where \( n \) is the length of the string `num` and \( m \) is the number of possible endings (which is 4 in this case). This results in a complexity of \( O(4n) \), simplifying to \( O(n) \), since 4 is a constant.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(1) \) because we are only using a fixed amount of extra space for variables and not using any additional data structures dependent on the input size.

### Summary

This approach effectively finds the minimum number of deletions needed by checking each digit pair at the end of the string and counting the steps required to form any of the valid special number endings.
