[Leetcode 2789. Largest Element in an Array after Merge Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2789)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers.

You can perform the following operation on the array any number of times:

- Choose two adjacent elements and replace them with their sum.

Return the maximum possible element that you can get in the array after any number of merge operations.

### Example
- Example 1:
  - Input: nums = [2,3,7,9,3]
  - Output: 24
  - Explanation: You can merge the first two elements to get nums = [5,7,9,3], 
  then merge the next two to get nums = [5,16,3], then merge the last two to get nums = [5,19], 
  finally you can merge the two elements to get a sum of 24.

- Example 2:
  - Input: nums = [1,1,1,1]
  - Output: 4
  - Explanation: After merging all elements, the array becomes [4] and the largest element is 4.

### Constraints
- 1 <= nums.length <= 1000
- 1 <= nums[i] <= 10^6

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can we assume that the input array will always contain at least one element?
2. Are there any limits to the number of merge operations we can perform?

## Strategy

To solve this problem, the key observation is that the largest possible element we can get in the array after any number of merge operations is the total sum of the array. This is because, no matter how we merge adjacent elements, the final element in the array will be the sum of all the initial elements.

Steps:
1. Calculate the sum of all elements in the array.
2. Return this sum as the result.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the input array, since we are just calculating the sum of the elements.

## Code

```javascript
function getMaxElement(nums) {
  // Calculate the sum of the elements in the array
  let totalSum = nums.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);
  
  // Return the total sum
  return totalSum;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(getMaxElement([2, 3, 7, 9, 3])); // Output: 24
console.log(getMaxElement([1, 1, 1, 1]));     // Output: 4
```

This function takes an array of integers as its input, calculates the total sum of its elements, and returns this sum as the output.
