[Leetcode 148. Sort List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l148)
### Problem Statement

Given the head of a linked list, sort the list in ascending order and return its head.

*Example:*

```
Input: head = [4,2,1,3]
Output: [1,2,3,4]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input list contain duplicate values?**
   - Yes, the list can contain duplicates.

2. **Is there a constraint on the space complexity?**
   - Ideally, the solution should have O(1) auxiliary space (i.e., sort the list in-place), but O(log n) recursive stack space is allowed due to the recursive nature of some sorting algorithms.

3. **What is the length range of the linked list?**
   - The length of the linked list can range from 0 to 10^5.

### Strategy

We'll use the Merge Sort algorithm for sorting the linked list, as it is well-suited for linked lists due to its O(n log n) time complexity and can be implemented in an efficient manner.

**Step-by-Step Strategy with Merge Sort:**

1. **Base Case:** If the list is null or has only one element, it is already sorted. Return the head.
2. **Splitting the List:** Use the slow and fast pointer technique to find the middle of the list, then split the list into two halves.
3. **Recursive Sorting:** Recursively sort the two halves.
4. **Merging:** Merge the two sorted halves into one sorted list.

### Code

```javascript
class ListNode {
    constructor(val = 0, next = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.next = next;
    }
}

var sortList = function(head) {
    if (!head || !head.next) return head;

    // Find the middle of the list
    let slow = head;
    let fast = head;
    let prev = null;

    while (fast && fast.next) {
        prev = slow;
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
    }

    // Split the list into two halves
    prev.next = null;

    // Sort each half recursively
    let l1 = sortList(head);
    let l2 = sortList(slow);

    // Merge the sorted halves
    return merge(l1, l2);
};

// Function to merge two sorted linked lists
function merge(l1, l2) {
    let dummy = new ListNode();
    let current = dummy;

    while (l1 && l2) {
        if (l1.val < l2.val) {
            current.next = l1;
            l1 = l1.next;
        } else {
            current.next = l2;
            l2 = l2.next;
        }
        current = current.next;
    }

    current.next = l1 || l2;

    return dummy.next;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n log n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because the list is split into halves recursively (log n levels), and each level involves O(n) operations to merge two halves together.
- **Space Complexity:** O(log n) for the recursive stack space used during the merge sort process. The linked list nodes themselves are being rearranged in place, so no additional space is required beyond the recursion stack.
