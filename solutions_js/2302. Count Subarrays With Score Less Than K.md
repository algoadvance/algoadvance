[Leetcode 2302. Count Subarrays With Score Less Than K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2302)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of integers and an integer `k`, return the number of non-empty subarrays of `nums` whose sum is less than `k`.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size range for the array `nums`?**
   - The size of the array can vary; thus, the solution should be efficient even for larger sizes.

2. **Are there any constraints on the values within the array `nums`?**
   - The values in the array can be negative, zero, or positive integers.

3. **What about the value of `k`?**
   - `k` is a positive integer.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the **sliding window** (two-pointer) technique:

1. **Initialize two pointers**: `left` and `right` both starting at the beginning of the array.
2. **Expand the window by moving the `right` pointer**: Calculate the sum of the current window between `left` and `right`.
3. **Check the condition**: If the sum of the current window is less than `k`, then all subarrays ending at `right` and starting from `left` to `right` have a sum less than `k`. Count all these subarrays.
4. **Shrink the window**: If the sum is not less than `k`, move the `left` pointer to the right to try and reduce the sum.
5. **Continue the process** for all possible subarrays by iterating `right` from start to end.

### Code

```javascript
var countSubarrays = function(nums, k) {
    let n = nums.length;
    let count = 0;
    let sum = 0;
    let left = 0;
    
    for (let right = 0; right < n; right++) {
        sum += nums[right];
        
        while (sum >= k && left <= right) {
            sum -= nums[left];
            left++;
        }
        
        // All subarrays ending at 'right' with sums less than 'k'
        // start anywhere from 'left' to 'right'
        count += (right - left + 1);
    }
    
    return count;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(countSubarrays([2, 1, 4, 3, 2], 6)); // Output: 8
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialize** `sum` to be 0 and `left` pointer to be 0.
2. Iterate `right` from 0 to `n-1` (the length of the array).
3. Add `nums[right]` to `sum`.
4. If `sum` is greater than or equal to `k`, move the `left` pointer to the right while subtracting the elements from `sum` until `sum` becomes less than `k`.
5. Once the sum is less than `k`, calculate the number of subarrays that end at `right` and have a sum less than `k` and add this count to the result.
6. Return the final count of such subarrays.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. Each element is processed at most twice (once by `right` and once by `left`).
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), only a few extra variables are used for indices and sums.
