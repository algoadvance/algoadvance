[Leetcode 2509. Cycle Length Queries in a Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2509)
### Problem Statement

You are given a tree (an undirected graph with no cycles) with `n` nodes numbered from `1` to `n`. The tree is rooted at node `1`.

You are also given an array `queries` where each query is a pair `(a, b)`, representing the nodes `a` and `b`.

For each query, calculate the length of the cycle that would be created if we add an edge between nodes `a` and `b`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is it guaranteed that the nodes in each query exist in the tree?**
   - Yes, each node in the query will be between `1` and `n`.

2. **Can we assume the tree structure is connected and acyclic?**
   - Yes, the tree by definition is connected and acyclic.

3. **What are the constraints on the number of nodes and number of queries?**
   - There are no constraints provided in the problem statement, but typical constraints would need to be considered, such as `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^4` for tree nodes and `m` queries.

4. **What is the format of the input?**
   - The input consists of a number of nodes `n`, the tree edges defining its structure, and the array of queries.

### Strategy

1. **Tree Representation and Depth Calculation**:
   - We'll use an adjacency list to represent the tree.
   - Perform a Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to calculate the depth of each node from the root.
   
2. **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA)**:
   - Implement a method to find the LCA of two nodes. This can be done efficiently using Binary Lifting or DFS.

3. **Cycle Length Calculation**:
   - For each query `(a, b)`, find the LCA of `a` and `b`.
   - The cycle length can be calculated by `depth[a] + depth[b] - 2 * depth[LCA(a, b)] + 1`.

### Code

```javascript
class Tree {
    constructor(n) {
        this.adjList = new Array(n + 1).fill(0).map(() => []);
        this.depth = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
        this.parent = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    }
    
    addEdge(u, v) {
        this.adjList[u].push(v);
        this.adjList[v].push(u);
    }
    
    dfs(node, par) {
        for (let neighbor of this.adjList[node]) {
            if (neighbor !== par) {
                this.depth[neighbor] = this.depth[node] + 1;
                this.parent[neighbor] = node;
                this.dfs(neighbor, node);
            }
        }
    }
    
    findLCA(u, v) {
        if (this.depth[u] < this.depth[v]) [u, v] = [v, u];
        
        while (this.depth[u] > this.depth[v]) {
            u = this.parent[u];
        }
        
        while (u !== v) {
            u = this.parent[u];
            v = this.parent[v];
        }
        
        return u;
    }
    
    queryCycleLength(u, v) {
        const lca = this.findLCA(u, v);
        return this.depth[u] + this.depth[v] - 2 * this.depth[lca] + 1;
    }
}

const findCycleLengths = (n, edges, queries) => {
    const tree = new Tree(n);
    
    for (let [u, v] of edges) {
        tree.addEdge(u, v);
    }
    
    // Start DFS from the root node (1)
    tree.dfs(1, -1);
    
    const results = [];
    for (let [a, b] of queries) {
        results.push(tree.queryCycleLength(a, b));
    }
    
    return results;
};

// Example usage:
const n = 5;
const edges = [[1, 2], [1, 3], [3, 4], [3, 5]];
const queries = [[2, 4], [4, 5]];
console.log(findCycleLengths(n, edges, queries)); // Output: [4, 3]
```

### Analysis of Time Complexity

- **Tree Construction**: Storing edges in the adjacency list has a time complexity of O(n).
  
- **Depth Calculation via DFS**: This operation also runs in O(n).

- **Lowest Common Ancestor (LCA) Calculation**: Each LCA query and depth calculation can be handled in O(log n) using binary lifting methods, but in this simpler approach, it is O(n) in the worst case.

- **Cycle Length Calculation for Each Query**: Each query runs in O(n), and for `m` queries this results in O(m * n).

Given typical constraints of `n` and `m`, optimizations such as binary lifting for efficient LCA calculation can be considered for improvement.
