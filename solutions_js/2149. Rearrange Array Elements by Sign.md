[Leetcode 2149. Rearrange Array Elements by Sign](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2149)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums` of **even** length, rearrange the values such that:

- Every `nums[i]` is positive.
- Every `nums[i + 1]` is negative.

In other words, an element at index 0 is positive, at index 1 is negative, at index 2 is positive, and so on. This applies to the whole array.

Return the modified array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Will the input array always contain an equal number of positive and negative numbers?
    - **Yes, the problem guarantees that the input array will contain an equal number of positive and negative numbers.**
2. Is it necessary to maintain the relative order of the positive and negative integers?
    - **Maintaining the relative order is not specified, so we do not need to maintain the original order.**
3. Can the array contain zero?
    - **No, according to the problem statement, only positive and negative integers are present.**

### Strategy

1. We will use two pointers method:
   - One to iterate through positive integers.
   - One to iterate through negative integers.
2. We initialize two empty arrays: one for positive elements and one for negative elements.
3. Traverse the array once to separate positive and negative integers into their respective arrays.
4. Create a new array and alternate between positive and negative elements using the two arrays.

### Code

```javascript
function rearrangeArray(nums) {
    let positives = [];
    let negatives = [];
    
    // Separate positives and negatives
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (num > 0) {
            positives.push(num);
        } else {
            negatives.push(num);
        }
    }
    
    // Rearrange the array
    let result = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < positives.length; i++) {
        result.push(positives[i]);
        result.push(negatives[i]);
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Example usage:
const nums = [3, 1, -2, -5, 2, -4];
console.log(rearrangeArray(nums)); // Output: [3, -2, 1, -5, 2, -4]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - Separating positives and negatives: O(n)
  - Constructing the result array: O(n)

- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
  - Space for `positives` and `negatives` arrays which combined make up the same number of elements as the input array. Therefore, additional space is linear in relation to the input size.
