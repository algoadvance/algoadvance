[Leetcode 735. Asteroid Collision](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l735)
### Problem Statement
We are given an array `asteroids` of integers representing asteroids in a row. For each asteroid, the absolute value represents its size, and the sign represents its direction (positive means moving right, negative means moving left). Each asteroid moves at the same speed.

Find out the state of the asteroids after all collisions. If two asteroids meet, the smaller one will explode. If they are the same size, both will explode. Two asteroids moving in the same direction will never meet.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: asteroids = [5, 10, -5]
Output: [5, 10]
Explanation: The 10 and -5 collide resulting in 10. The 5 and 10 never collide.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can there be an empty input array?
   **A:** Yes, if the input array is empty, the output should also be an empty array.

2. **Q:** Is there a specific range for the asteroid sizes?
   **A:** There is no specified range in the problem, so we assume the sizes are reasonable integers.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we'll use a stack to simulate the collision process:

1. Traverse each asteroid in the input list.
2. If the stack is empty or the current asteroid is moving right (`> 0`), push it onto the stack.
3. If the current asteroid is moving left (`< 0`), check the top of the stack:
   - If the top of the stack is a moving right asteroid (`> 0`), compare their sizes:
     - If the top of the stack asteroid is smaller, pop the stack and continue the comparison.
     - If they are of the same size, pop the stack and stop the comparison.
     - If the top of the stack asteroid is larger, do nothing and move to the next asteroid.
   - If the top of the stack is a moving left asteroid or the stack is empty, push the current asteroid onto the stack because no collision occurs.

Finally, the stack will contain the state of asteroids after all collisions.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} asteroids
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var asteroidCollision = function(asteroids) {
    let stack = [];
    
    for (let asteroid of asteroids) {
        let exploded = false;
        
        while (stack.length > 0 && asteroid < 0 && stack[stack.length - 1] > 0) {
            let top = stack[stack.length - 1];
            
            if (Math.abs(top) > Math.abs(asteroid)) {
                exploded = true;
                break;
            } else if (Math.abs(top) === Math.abs(asteroid)) {
                stack.pop();
                exploded = true;
                break;
            } else {
                stack.pop();
            }
        }
        
        if (!exploded) {
            stack.push(asteroid);
        }
    }
    
    return stack;
};

// Example usage:
let asteroids = [5, 10, -5];
console.log(asteroidCollision(asteroids)); // Output: [5, 10]
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of asteroids. Each asteroid is pushed and popped from the stack at most once. Hence, the algorithm processes each asteroid in constant time.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is `O(n)` in the worst case where no collisions occur and all asteroids are stored in the stack.
