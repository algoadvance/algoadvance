### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 283: Move Zeroes

Given an integer array `nums`, move all `0`s to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,12]
Output: [1,3,12,0,0]
```

**Note:**
1. You must do this in-place without making a copy of the array.
2. Minimize the total number of operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Can we use additional arrays/data structures?**
   A: No, the operation needs to be in-place.

2. **Q: Are negative numbers or other non-zero values allowed in the array?**
   A: Yes, the array can contain any integer values.

3. **Q: Should the non-zero elements retain their original order?**
   A: Yes, the relative order of non-zero elements must be preserved.

### Code

```javascript
function moveZeroes(nums) {
    let lastNonZeroFoundAt = 0;

    // First pass: move all non-zero elements to the front
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] !== 0) {
            nums[lastNonZeroFoundAt] = nums[i];
            lastNonZeroFoundAt++;
        }
    }
    
    // Second pass: fill the rest with zeroes
    for (let i = lastNonZeroFoundAt; i < nums.length; i++) {
        nums[i] = 0;
    }
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Pointer:** Start by initializing a pointer `lastNonZeroFoundAt` to keep track of the position to place the next non-zero element.

2. **First Pass - Move Non-Zero Elements:**
   - Iterate through the array.
   - Whenever a non-zero element is encountered, place it at the `lastNonZeroFoundAt` index.
   - Increment `lastNonZeroFoundAt` to point to the next available position.

3. **Second Pass - Fill with Zeroes:**
   - All indices from `lastNonZeroFoundAt` to the end of the array should be set to 0.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because:

1. We traverse the array twice (each pass being O(n)).
2. We perform simple assignments in both passes which take constant time.

The space complexity is O(1) since the process is done in-place and no additional data structures are used.

This solution is efficient for large arrays as it minimizes both the number of operations and the additional memory usage.
