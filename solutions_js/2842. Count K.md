[Leetcode 2842. Count K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2842)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string, and you need to count the number of k-subsequences with maximum beauty. The beauty of a string is defined by the number of distinct characters it contains. A k-subsequence is a subsequence that contains exactly `k` characters.

Here's a breakdown:
- You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`.
- A subsequence is a sequence derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.
- You need to determine the number of distinct k-length subsequences with maximum beauty from the provided string.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What are the maximum lengths for the string `s`?
   - What is the maximum value of `k`?

2. **Output Details**:
   - Should the output be the number of such subsequences or the subsequences themselves?

3. **Character Details**:
   - Does the string `s` contain only lowercase English letters?
   - Are there any special characters to consider?

## Strategy

1. **Count Character Frequencies**:
   - Determine the number of distinct characters and their frequencies in the string `s`.

2. **Evaluate Subsequence Constraints**:
   - If `k` is greater than the number of distinct characters in `s`, it is impossible to form such subsequences.
   - If `k` is less than or equal to the number of distinct characters, focus on selecting `k` distinct characters forming the subsequence with the highest frequency.

3. **Mathematical Computation**:
   - Utilize combinatorial mathematics to find the number of ways to form k-length subsequences from the selected characters.

## Code

Here's a JavaScript implementation to solve the problem:

```javascript
function countKSubsequencesWithMaxBeauty(s, k) {
    if (k > s.length) return 0;

    const charCount = {};
    for (let char of s) {
        charCount[char] = (charCount[char] || 0) + 1;
    }

    const distinctChars = Object.keys(charCount);
    if (k > distinctChars.length) return 0;

    const sortedChars = [...distinctChars].sort((a, b) => charCount[b] - charCount[a]);
    let maxBeautyChars = sortedChars.slice(0, k);
    let subsequenceCount = 1;

    for (let char of maxBeautyChars) {
        subsequenceCount *= charCount[char];
    }

    return subsequenceCount;
}

// Example Usage:
let s = "aabbcc";
let k = 2;
console.log(countKSubsequencesWithMaxBeauty(s, k)); // Example output could be 12
```

## Explanation and Time Complexity

### Explanation:
1. **Character Count Calculation**:
   - We count the frequency of each character in the string.
2. **Sorting by Frequency**:
   - Sort the characters by their frequency in descending order to prioritize the most frequent characters.
3. **Combinatorial Calculation**:
   - From the sorted list, we pick the top `k` characters and calculate the number of possible k-subsequences formed by them using their frequencies.

### Time Complexity:
- **Character Counting**: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- **Sorting**: `O(m log m)` where `m` is the number of distinct characters.
- **Subsequence Calculation**: `O(k)` for multiplying the frequencies.

Overall, the time complexity is `O(n + m log m + k)`, making it efficient for reasonably large inputs within typical constraints.
