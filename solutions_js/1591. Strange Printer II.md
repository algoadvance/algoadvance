[Leetcode 1591. Strange Printer II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1591)
## Problem Statement
You are given a 2D matrix `targetGrid` of size `m x n`. The grid contains integers from 1 to 60, representing different colors. A strange printer prints the grid one color at a time. Each time the printer can print any rectangle that has the same color on it. 

You want to know if it's possible to print the matrix `targetGrid`.

**Input:**
- `targetGrid`: a 2D matrix of size `m x n` containing integers from 1 to 60

**Output:**
- Return `true` if it is possible to print the matrix `targetGrid`, otherwise return `false`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the colors be printed in any order?
2. Is there any restriction on overlapping colors?
3. Can we assume that the input grid is always valid?

## Strategy
To solve this problem, the core idea is to check if it's possible to print the grid in layers, from the base layer to the top layer. The algorithm involves:
1. Identifying distinct rectangles in the `targetGrid` for each color.
2. Verifying if these rectangles conform to the order of their layers (i.e., every rectangle of a certain color should not contain a different color inside it except via its border).

### Steps:
1. Iterate through the grid to collect all coordinates for each color.
2. For each color, determine the boundary coordinates (minimum and maximum row and column indices).
3. Check if the rectangles corresponding to each color can be printed without violating the rules.
4. A color can be printed if its rectangle does not contain a pixel of another color within its boundary.

## Code
Below is an implementation in JavaScript that adheres to the described strategy:

```javascript
var isPrintable = function(targetGrid) {
    const m = targetGrid.length;
    const n = targetGrid[0].length;

    // Collect all unique colors
    let colors = new Set();
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            colors.add(targetGrid[i][j]);
        }
    }

    // Initialize color boundaries (minRow, minCol, maxRow, maxCol)
    const colorBoundaries = {};
    colors.forEach(color => {
        colorBoundaries[color] = [m, n, 0, 0]; // initially set to (infinity, infinity, -infinity, -infinity)
    });

    // Fill in the boundaries for each color
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            const color = targetGrid[i][j];
            const [minRow, minCol, maxRow, maxCol] = colorBoundaries[color];
            colorBoundaries[color] = [
                Math.min(minRow, i),
                Math.min(minCol, j),
                Math.max(maxRow, i),
                Math.max(maxCol, j)
            ];
        }
    }

    // Check if it's possible to print the rectangles for each color
    const canPrint = (color) => {
        const [minRow, minCol, maxRow, maxCol] = colorBoundaries[color];
        for (let i = minRow; i <= maxRow; i++) {
            for (let j = minCol; j <= maxCol; j++) {
                if (targetGrid[i][j] !== color && colorBoundaries[targetGrid[i][j]][0] !== -1) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
        return true;
    };

    // Remove printables colors
    while (colors.size > 0) {
        let found = false;
        for (const color of colors) {
            if (canPrint(color)) {
                found = true;
                colors.delete(color);
                const [minRow, minCol, maxRow, maxCol] = colorBoundaries[color];
                for (let i = minRow; i <= maxRow; i++) {
                    for (let j = minCol; j <= maxCol; j++) {
                        targetGrid[i][j] = 0; // mark as printed
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        if (!found) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Initialization and color boundary setup:** O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns.
- **Can Print Check:** Each rectangle is checked once. So, in total, it will be O(c * (m*n)), where c is the number of unique colors and the maximum number of cells checked is m*n.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(m * n * c), where m and n are the number of rows and columns, respectively, and c is the number of distinct colors.
