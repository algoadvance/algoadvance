[Leetcode 2276. Count Integers in Intervals](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2276)
### Problem Statement

You are given an empty data structure that will be used to execute a sequence of operations:

1. `add(left, right)`: Adds the closed interval [left, right] to the data structure.
2. `count() -> int`: Returns the number of integers currently stored in the data structure, considering that intervals might overlap.

Implement the data structure such that these operations are done efficiently.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Do the intervals provided in the `add` operation include both `left` and `right`?**
   - Yes, they are inclusive intervals.
  
2. **Can intervals overlap or be contiguous?**
   - Yes, intervals can overlap or be contiguous.
  
3. **What is the maximum range for `left` and `right`?**
   - They are assumed to be within reasonable integer ranges, considering JavaScript's handling of numbers.

4. **How frequently are the `add` and `count` operations called?**
   - Let's assume both operations might be called many times, hence efficiency is crucial.
  
### Strategy

To efficiently manage intervals and calculate the count of unique integers, we can leverage a data structure that merges overlapping intervals and maintains the sum dynamically.

1. **Intervals Storage**: We'll store intervals in a list and maintain a merged list of intervals to handle overlapping cases.
2. **Merge Intervals**: Each time a new interval is added, we merge it with any overlapping previous intervals.
3. **Count Calculation**: The sum of lengths of merged intervals will give the current count of integers.

### Code

```javascript
class Intervals {
    constructor() {
        this.intervals = [];
    }

    add(left, right) {
        let newInterval = [left, right];
        let result = [];
        let added = false;

        for (let interval of this.intervals) {
            if (interval[1] < newInterval[0]) {
                // Current interval is completely before newInterval
                result.push(interval);
            } else if (newInterval[1] < interval[0]) {
                // Current interval is completely after newInterval
                if (!added) {
                    result.push(newInterval);
                    added = true;
                }
                result.push(interval);
            } else {
                // Overlapping intervals
                newInterval = [Math.min(newInterval[0], interval[0]), Math.max(newInterval[1], interval[1])];
            }
        }

        if (!added) {
            result.push(newInterval);
        }

        this.intervals = result;
    }

    count() {
        let total = 0;
        for (let interval of this.intervals) {
            total += interval[1] - interval[0] + 1;
        }
        return total;
    }
}

// Usage:
const intervals = new Intervals();
intervals.add(1, 5);
intervals.add(10, 15);
intervals.add(20, 25);
intervals.add(12, 27);
console.log(intervals.count()); // Should print 18
```

### Time Complexity

1. **`add(left, right)`**:
   - The worst-case time complexity to add an interval is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of non-overlapping intervals stored. This is because we need to potentially merge with all current intervals.
   
2. **`count()`**:
   - The time complexity for calculating the count is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of non-overlapping intervals, as we sum up interval lengths.

This approach maintains efficiency by ensuring that intervals are always merged and stored in a minimal form.
