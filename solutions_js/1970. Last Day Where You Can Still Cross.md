[Leetcode 1970. Last Day Where You Can Still Cross](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1970)
### Problem Statement
Given an m x n binary matrix `cells` where each `cells[i] = [ri, ci]` represents the cell (`ri`, `ci`) being filled with water on the ith day, we want to find the latest day (1-indexed) you can still walk from the top to the bottom by only walking on land cells (i.e., cells with value 0). You can only move up, down, left, or right.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: What are the constraints on m and n?**
   - A: They are both integers with bounds generally around `1 <= m, n <= 200`.

2. **Q: Can we assume that on the initial day, the grid is completely dry (all cells are land)?**
   - A: Yes, initially all cells are land.

3. **Q: Can we walk diagonally?**
   - A: No, you can only move up, down, left, or right.

### Strategy
1. **Initial Observations:**
   - We need to find the last day where a path exists from the top row to the bottom row.
   - As more days pass, more cells fill with water, making it harder to find such a path.

2. **Approach:**
   - Binary Search on the day: Since the problem is to find the last day we can still traverse, we can do a binary search on days.
   - Use BFS/DFS to check for path: For a given day, we check if there's a valid path from any cell in the top row to any cell in the bottom row using BFS or DFS.

3. **Algorithm:**
   - Binary search on the day interval `[0, m*n-1]`.
   - For each midpoint day, construct the grid up to that day and check if there is a path using BFS or DFS.
   - Adjust the binary search interval based on whether a path is found.

4. **Time Complexity:**
   - The complexity of the binary search is `O(log (m*n))`.
   - Checking if a path exists using BFS/DFS is `O(m * n)` because we might need to visit every cell.

### Code
```javascript
function latestDayToCross(row, col, cells) {
    let left = 1, right = cells.length;

    const directions = [[0, 1], [1, 0], [0, -1], [-1, 0]];

    const canCross = (day) => {
        const grid = Array.from({ length: row }, () => Array(col).fill(0));

        for (let i = 0; i < day; i++) {
            let [r, c] = cells[i];
            grid[r - 1][c - 1] = 1;
        }

        const queue = [];
        for (let c = 0; c < col; c++) {
            if (grid[0][c] === 0) {
                queue.push([0, c]);
                grid[0][c] = -1; // Mark as visited;
            }
        }

        while (queue.length > 0) {
            let [x, y] = queue.shift();
            if (x === row - 1) return true; // Reached the last row

            for (let [dx, dy] of directions) {
                let nx = x + dx, ny = y + dy;
                if (nx >= 0 && nx < row && ny >= 0 && ny < col && grid[nx][ny] === 0) {
                    queue.push([nx, ny]);
                    grid[nx][ny] = -1; // Mark as visited;
                }
            }
        }
        return false;
    };

    while (left < right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right + 1) / 2);
        if (canCross(mid)) {
            left = mid; // Try for a later day
        } else {
            right = mid - 1; // Try for an earlier day
        }
    }

    return left;
}

// Example usage:
// latestDayToCross(3, 3, [[1,2],[2,1],[3,3],[2,2],[1,1],[1,3],[2,3],[3,2],[3,1]]);
```

### Analysis
- **Binary Search**: `O(log (m*n))`
- **BFS/DFS**: `O(m * n)` within each binary search step
- **Total Complexity**: `O((m * n) * log (m * n))`

This ensures we efficiently find the latest day to cross the grid safely.
