[Leetcode 1320. Minimum Distance to Type a Word Using Two Fingers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1320)
### Problem Statement

**1320. Minimum Distance to Type a Word Using Two Fingers**

You have a keyboard layout of a standard English QWERTY format where each character is placed at a unique position in a 5x6 grid (i.e., 5 rows and 6 columns). The position of each character is represented by its row and column index in the grid.

Given a string `word`, you need to type the string with two fingers. The cost of moving a finger from one character to another is the Manhattan distance between their positions. The Manhattan distance between positions `(r1, c1)` and `(r2, c2)` is `|r1 - r2| + |c1 - c2|`.

Find the minimum total distance to type out the word using two fingers.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are the initial positions of both fingers fixed or can they start at any arbitrary position?**
   - Both fingers can start at any arbitrary position which gives flexibility in choosing optimal starting positions.

2. **Is there any restriction on which finger types which letter?**
   - No, there isn't. Either finger can type any letter, meaning we need to look for an optimal way to distribute the typing task between two fingers to minimize total movement.

3. **Should we consider only uppercase English letters?**
   - Yes, the input will only contain uppercase English letters.

### Strategy
1. **Build the Keyboard Grid:**
   - Represent the positions of each letter on the keyboard in a dictionary for quick lookup.

2. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - We'll use dynamic programming to minimize total distance.
   - Define a DP state `dp[i][j][k]` where 
     - `i` is the current letter in the word we need to type,
     - `j` is the index in the word where one finger currently is,
     - `k` is the index in the word where the other finger currently is.

3. **Recurrence Relation:**
   - The transition will involve calculating the cost of moving one of the fingers to the next letter in the word while keeping track of the cost incurred so far.
   - This can be recursively defined and memoized to avoid repeated computation.

4. **Initialization and Result Extraction:**
   - Start with the base case when no letters have been typed, and iterate to find the minimum cost by comparing all possible transitions.

### Code

```javascript
var minimumDistance = function(word) {
    // Keyboard layout-map
    const keyboard = {};
    for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
        keyboard[String.fromCharCode(65 + i)] = [Math.floor(i / 6), i % 6];
    }

    const n = word.length;
    const memo = new Map();

    const getCost = (ch1, ch2) => {
        if (!ch1 || !ch2) return 0;
        const [r1, c1] = keyboard[ch1];
        const [r2, c2] = keyboard[ch2];
        return Math.abs(r1 - r2) + Math.abs(c1 - c2);
    };

    const dp = (index, f1, f2) => {
        if (index === n) return 0;
        const key = `${index}-${f1}-${f2}`;
        if (memo.has(key)) return memo.get(key);

        const next = word[index];
        
        // Move first finger to the next character
        const cost1 = getCost(f1, next) + dp(index + 1, next, f2);
        
        // Move second finger to the next character
        const cost2 = getCost(f2, next) + dp(index + 1, f1, next);

        const result = Math.min(cost1, cost2);
        memo.set(key, result);
        return result;
    };

    return dp(0, '', '');
};

```
### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n^3)` in the worst case scenario where `n` is the length of the word due to state expansion in dynamic programming. However, due to memoization, most overlapping subproblems are computed only once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n^2)` due to the memoization storage for each pair of indices and position states.

This will efficiently compute the minimum total distance required to type the given word using two fingers.
