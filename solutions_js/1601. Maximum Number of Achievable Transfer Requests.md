[Leetcode 1601. Maximum Number of Achievable Transfer Requests](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1601)
## Problem Statement:
We are given `n` buildings and an array of transfer requests `requests` where each `requests[i]` = [from_i, to_i] represents a request to transfer a person from building `from_i` to building `to_i`. We need to find out the maximum number of requests that can be achieved while ensuring no buildings end up with a negative number of people.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can the number of requests be higher than the number of buildings?
   - Yes, the number of requests can be higher than the number of buildings.
2. Are self-transfers (i.e., from the same building to itself) allowed and do they count towards the total?
   - Yes, self-transfers are allowed and they count towards the total.
3. Is there any particular format for the input constraints?
   - The number of buildings `n` will be between `1` and `20`, and the number of requests will be between `1` and `16`.

## Strategy:
1. **Brute Force (Backtracking)**: Given the constraint is small (`n <= 20` and `requests.length <= 16`), we can afford a brute force approach.
2. **State Representation**: Using a balance array to represent the net change of people in each building. This helps ensure no building ends up with a negative number of people.
3. **Recursion**: Try including or excluding each request and check which combination gives the maximum number of achievable requests.

## Code:
```javascript
function maximumRequests(n, requests) {
    let maxAchievable = 0;

    function backtrack(index, balance, count) {
        // If all requests have been processed
        if (index === requests.length) {
            if (balance.every(b => b === 0)) {
                maxAchievable = Math.max(maxAchievable, count);
            }
            return;
        }

        // Trying to include the current request
        const [from, to] = requests[index];
        balance[from]--;
        balance[to]++;
        backtrack(index + 1, balance, count + 1);

        // Backtrack: Revert the changes
        balance[from]++;
        balance[to]--;

        // Trying not to include the current request
        backtrack(index + 1, balance, count);
    }

    const initialBalance = new Array(n).fill(0);
    backtrack(0, initialBalance, 0);

    return maxAchievable;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(maximumRequests(3, [[0,0], [1,2], [2,1]])); // Output: 3
console.log(maximumRequests(3, [[0,1], [1,2], [2,0], [1,0], [2,1], [0,2]])); // Output: 6
console.log(maximumRequests(3, [[0,1], [1,2], [2,0]])); // Output: 3
console.log(maximumRequests(3, [[0,3], [3,1], [2,1]])); // Output: 0
```

## Time Complexity:
- Total number of subsets of requests is `2^m` where `m` is the number of requests.
- For each subset, we spend `O(n)` time to update the balance array and check.
- Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(m * 2^m)`, where `m` is the length of the requests.
