[Leetcode 1277. Count Square Submatrices with All Ones](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1277)
### Problem Statement

Given a `m x n` binary matrix (filled with 0's and 1's), count the number of square submatrices that have all ones.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the definition of a submatrix?
   - A submatrix is a contiguous block of the original matrix.

2. Does the size of the square submatrices matter?
   - Yes, we're specifically looking for square submatrices of all sizes that contain only ones.

3. Should we return the count of submatrices or the submatrices themselves?
   - We should return the count of such submatrices.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use Dynamic Programming (DP). Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. **Create a DP Table**: Define a 2D DP array `dp` of the same size as the input matrix.
2. **Base Case Initialization**: Initialize the first row and the first column of the `dp` table with the same values as the original matrix, because a single cell can form a 1x1 matrix only if it is 1.
3. **DP Transition**:
    - For each cell `(i, j)`, if `matrix[i][j]` is 1, then the size of the square submatrix ending at that cell, will be the minimum of the sizes of possible squares from the left `(i, j-1)`, top `(i-1, j)`, and top-left diagonal `(i-1, j-1)` cells plus 1.
    - Update the `dp` table accordingly.
4. **Sum the Counts**: Sum all the values in the `dp` table to get the total count of square submatrices with all ones.

### Code

```javascript
var countSquares = function(matrix) {
    let rows = matrix.length;
    let cols = matrix[0].length;
    let dp = Array.from(Array(rows), () => Array(cols).fill(0));
    let totalCount = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            if (matrix[i][j] === 1) {
                if (i === 0 || j === 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = 1;
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1;
                }
                totalCount += dp[i][j];
            }
        }
    }

    return totalCount;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows, and `n` is the number of columns in the matrix. This is because we are iterating through each cell once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(m * n) for the DP table. However, we could reduce this to O(n) if we optimize and use a single row array for DP.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count all possible square submatrices consisting entirely of ones.
