[Leetcode 1299. Replace Elements with Greatest Element on Right Side](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1299)
### Problem Statement
Given an array `arr`, replace every element in that array with the greatest element among the elements to its right, and replace the last element with `-1`. After doing so, return the array.

**Example 1:**
```plaintext
Input: arr = [17,18,5,4,6,1]
Output: [18,6,6,6,1,-1]
```

**Example 2:**
```plaintext
Input: arr = [400]
Output: [-1]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Should the function modify the array in place or can it return a new array?
   - The function can return the modified array.
2. Are there any constraints on the size of the array or the range of element values?
   - Let's assume standard constraints for an array length, such as `1 <= arr.length <= 10^4` and element values being typical integers.
3. Should the function handle empty arrays?
    - Given the problem constraints, we'll assume the array is never empty.

### Strategy
1. Initialize `max_from_right` with `-1` because the last element must always be replaced by `-1`.
2. Traverse the array from the rightmost end to the left.
3. For each element, store the current value, and replace the current element with `max_from_right`.
4. Update `max_from_right` to be the maximum of the stored current value and `max_from_right`.
5. Return the modified array.

### Code

```javascript
function replaceElements(arr) {
    let max_from_right = -1;
    // Traverse the array from the right
    for (let i = arr.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        let current = arr[i];
        arr[i] = max_from_right;
        max_from_right = Math.max(max_from_right, current);
    }
    return arr;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(replaceElements([17, 18, 5, 4, 6, 1])); // Output: [18, 6, 6, 6, 1, -1]
console.log(replaceElements([400])); // Output: [-1]
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where n is the length of the array. This is because the algorithm traverses the array exactly once.
- The space complexity is O(1) as we are using only a few extra variables and modifying the array in place.
