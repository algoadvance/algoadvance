[Leetcode 19. Remove Nth Node From End of List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l19)
### Problem Statement

Given the head of a linked list, remove the n-th node from the end of the list and return its head.

**Example:**

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5], n = 2
Output: [1,2,3,5]
Explanation: The linked list has been modified to remove the 4th node.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we do if `n` is greater than the length of the linked list?**
   - Typically guaranteed by constraints, but we assume it will never be out of range based on problem statement.
   
2. **What if `n` is equal to the length of the list?**
   - The head should be removed in this case.

3. **Can `n` be zero?**
   - Based on standard problem constraints, `n` is always at least 1.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use the two-pointer approach to identify and remove the `n`-th node from the end in one pass:

1. **Initialize two pointers** (`first` and `second`) both pointing to the start of the list.
2. **Advance the `first` pointer** by `n + 1` steps from the start to create a gap of `n` nodes between `first` and `second`.
3. Move both pointers forward until the `first` pointer reaches the end of the list.
4. At this point, the `second` pointer will be pointing just before the node we need to remove.
5. Adjust the `next` pointer of the `second` pointer to skip the target node.

### Code

```javascript
class ListNode {
    constructor(val = 0, next = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.next = next;
    }
}

function removeNthFromEnd(head, n) {
    // Create a dummy node that points to the head
    let dummy = new ListNode(0);
    dummy.next = head;
    
    // Initialize two pointers, both start from dummy node
    let first = dummy;
    let second = dummy;
    
    // Move first `n + 1` steps ahead
    for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        first = first.next;
    }
    
    // Move both pointers until first reaches the end
    while (first !== null) {
        first = first.next;
        second = second.next;
    }
    
    // Adjust the next pointer to remove the n-th node from the end
    second.next = second.next.next;
    
    // Return the new head, which dummy.next points to
    return dummy.next;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(L) where L is the length of the linked list. This is because we make a single pass through the list.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we use only a few extra pointers regardless of the input size.
