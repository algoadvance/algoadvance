[Leetcode 3242. Design Neighbor Sum Service](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3242)
## Problem Statement

Design a service that repeatedly takes new numbers and returns the sum of the two nearest (by absolute difference) numbers in the list. If there is a tie for nearest, take the smaller number. 

Implement the `NeighborSumService` class:
- `NeighborSumService()` Initializes the service.
- `int add(int num)` Adds a new number to the service and returns the sum of the two nearest numbers in the list.

Example:
```
NeighborSumService service = new NeighborSumService();
service.add(5); // returns 5 (no neighbors)
service.add(2); // returns 7 (nearest neighbors are 2 and 5)
service.add(8); // returns 10 (nearest neighbors are 5 and 8)
service.add(3); // returns 5 (nearest neighbors are 2 and 3)
service.add(4); // returns 7 (nearest neighbors are 3 and 4)
```

## Clarifying Questions

Before proceeding, let's clarify a few points:
1. Should the service handle negative numbers?
2. How should the service handle duplicate numbers?
3. What is the expected performance for the `add` method?

## Strategy

1. **Insert the number in sorted order** into an array or list to keep track of the numbers. This will ensure neighbors can be found efficiently.
2. Implement a binary search to find the correct insertion index for the new number. This ensures that we can maintain the sorted order in O(log n) time.
3. After inserting the number, find the nearest neighbors by checking adjacent elements around the new number.

### Steps:
1. Use an array to store the numbers in sorted order.
2. Use binary search to find the appropriate location to insert the new number.
3. Determine the nearest neighbors by checking the numbers at the positions before and after the insertion point.

## Code

```javascript
class NeighborSumService {
    constructor() {
        this.nums = [];
    }

    add(num) {
        // Using binary search to find the correct insertion point
        let left = 0, right = this.nums.length;
        while (left < right) {
            let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
            if (this.nums[mid] < num) left = mid + 1;
            else right = mid;
        }
        // Insert the number at the found position
        this.nums.splice(left, 0, num);

        // Edge cases: if there is only one number, return that number
        if (this.nums.length === 1) {
            return num;
        }

        // Determine the nearest neighbors
        let sum = Infinity;
        if (left > 0) sum = this.nums[left] + this.nums[left - 1];
        if (left < this.nums.length - 1) sum = Math.min(sum, this.nums[left] + this.nums[left + 1]);

        return sum;
    }
}

// Example usage:
// let service = new NeighborSumService();
// console.log(service.add(5)); // returns 5
// console.log(service.add(2)); // returns 7
// console.log(service.add(8)); // returns 10
// console.log(service.add(3)); // returns 5
// console.log(service.add(4)); // returns 7
```


## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the `add` method includes:
1. **Binary Search**: O(log n) to find the correct position.
2. **Array Insertion**: O(n) to insert at the right position in an array.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n) for the `add` method because insertion in an array in the worst case takes linear time.

For space complexity, the solution uses O(n) space due to storing the numbers in an array.
