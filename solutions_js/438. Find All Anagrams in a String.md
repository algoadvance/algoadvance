[Leetcode 438. Find All Anagrams in a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l438)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and a non-empty string `p`, find all the start indices of `p`'s anagrams in `s`. The output should be a list of integers representing the starting indices.

- Strings consist of lowercase English letters only.
- The length of both strings `s` and `p` will not be larger than 20,100.

Example:
```
Input:
s: "cbaebabacd" p: "abc"

Output:
[0, 6]

Explanation:
The substring with start index = 0 is "cba", which is an anagram of "abc".
The substring with start index = 6 is "bac", which is an anagram of "abc".
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the strings contain any characters other than lowercase English letters?**
   - No, the problem specifies lowercase English letters only.

2. **Do we need to consider the order of the characters in the output?**
   - Yes, the output should list indices in ascending order.

3. **Can `p` be longer than `s`?**
   - No, the length of `p` will always be less than or equal to the length of `s`.

### Strategy

1. **Sliding Window Technique**:
   - We need a window of the size of `p` that will slide over `s`.
   - Use two character count arrays: one for `p` and one for the current window in `s`.
   - Compare these two arrays: if they are identical, add the start index to the result list.
   
2. **Steps**:
   - Initialize two count arrays for characters, each of size 26 (for 'a' to 'z').
   - Populate the count array for `p` and the initial window in `s`.
   - Slide the window one character at a time, updating the count array for `s` and comparing it with `p`'s count array.
   - If they match, record the start index of the current window.

### Code

```javascript
function findAnagrams(s, p) {
    const result = [];
    const pLen = p.length;
    const sLen = s.length;

    if (sLen < pLen) return result;

    const pCount = new Array(26).fill(0);
    const sCount = new Array(26).fill(0);

    // Helper function to map character to index
    const charIndex = (char) => char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0);

    // Populate the pCount array
    for (let char of p) {
        pCount[charIndex(char)]++;
    }

    // Populate the sCount array for the first window
    for (let i = 0; i < pLen; i++) {
        sCount[charIndex(s[i])]++;
    }

    // Compare arrays and slide the window over `s`
    for (let i = 0; i <= sLen - pLen; i++) {
        if (i > 0) {
            // Slide the window: remove the char going out of the window, add the new char
            sCount[charIndex(s[i - 1])]--;
            sCount[charIndex(s[i + pLen - 1])]++;
        }
        // Compare count arrays
        if (sCount.join('') === pCount.join('')) {
            result.push(i);
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**:
  - Building the arrays for `p` (O(pLen)) and the first window in `s` (O(pLen)).
- **Sliding Window**:
  - Each step involves O(1) operations: updating the count arrays and comparing (O(1) for 26 comparisons).

- **Overall**:
  - The loop runs `sLen - pLen + 1` times, and each comparison is O(1) due to fixed-sized arrays.
  - **Total Time Complexity**: O(sLen + pLen).

This ensures an efficient solution to the problem, using a sliding window approach with fixed-size counting arrays for optimal performance.
