[Leetcode 1659. Maximize Grid Happiness](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1659)
## Problem Statement

You are given four integers: `m`, `n`, `introvertsCount`, and `extrovertsCount`. You have an `m x n` grid, and there are two types of people, introverts and extroverts. 

Introverts like being alone, while extroverts like company. You need to place `introvertsCount` introverts and `extrovertsCount` extroverts on the grid publicly, such that you maximize the overall happiness of the grid.

The happiness of each person is computed as follows:
- Placing an introvert in an empty spot decreases their happiness by 30.
- Placing an extrovert in an empty spot increases their happiness by 20.

Once placed, the happiness of a person can change based on the four neighboring cells (up, down, left, right). The changes are:
- For an introvert:
  - `+20` happiness if the neighboring cell is empty.
  - `-30` happiness if the neighboring cell has another introvert.
  - `-10` happiness if the neighboring cell has an extrovert.
- For an extrovert:
  - `+20` happiness if the neighboring cell is empty.
  - `+40` happiness if the neighboring cell has another extrovert.
  - `+20` happiness if the neighboring cell has an introvert.

Return the maximum possible happiness that can be achieved by placing the given number of introverts and extroverts on the grid.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned?**
   - The maximum possible grid happiness as an integer value.

2. **Are we ensured that there is always enough space on the grid for introverts and extroverts?**
   - Yes, since mÃ—n will be large enough to place `introvertsCount` and `extrovertsCount`.

3. **Can all four neighboring cells exist for any cell?**
   - No. Edge and corner cells will have fewer neighbouring cells.

4. **Is it possible for `introvertsCount` or `extrovertsCount` to be zero?**
   - Yes, either count can be zero, meaning we may only need to place just one type of person.

## Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we will use Dynamic Programming combined with bitmasking:
1. Use a bitmask to represent the state of the grid and the kinds of people in the cells.
2. Use DP to calculate the maximum possible happiness for that state.
3. Iterate through all possible states and apply transitions based on adding either an introvert or an extrovert.

## Code

Here is the implementation of this approach:

```javascript
const maxGridHappiness = (m, n, introvertsCount, extrovertsCount) => {
    const memo = {};

    const score = (ni, ne, state) => {
        let score = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if (((state >> (2 * i)) & 3) === 1) score -= 30; // Introvert
            if (((state >> (2 * i)) & 3) === 2) score += 20; // Extrovert
            if (i > 0) { // Adjacent effect to the left
                if (((state >> (2 * (i - 1))) & 3) === 1 && ((state >> (2 * i)) & 3) === 1) score -= 60;
                if (((state >> (2 * (i - 1))) & 3) === 1 && ((state >> (2 * i)) & 3) === 2) score -= 10;
                if (((state >> (2 * (i - 1))) & 3) === 2 && ((state >> (2 * i)) & 3) === 1) score -= 10;
                if (((state >> (2 * (i - 1))) & 3) === 2 && ((state >> (2 * i)) & 3) === 2) score += 40;
            }
        }
        return score;
    };

    const dp = (pos, ni, ne, state) => {
        if (ni < 0 || ne < 0) return -Infinity;
        if (pos === m * n) return 0;
        const key = [pos, ni, ne, state];
        if (key in memo) return memo[key];
        let res = dp(pos + 1, ni, ne, state >> 2); // Skip this cell
        if (ni > 0) res = Math.max(res, score(ni - 1, ne, state) + dp(pos + 1, ni - 1, ne, (state >> 2) | (1 << (2 * (n - 1)))));
        if (ne > 0) res = Math.max(res, score(ni, ne - 1, state) + dp(pos + 1, ni, ne - 1, (state >> 2) | (2 << (2 * (n - 1)))));
        return memo[key] = res;
    };

    return dp(0, introvertsCount, extrovertsCount, 0);
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is quite complex due to the nature of the DP and bitmasking approach:
- Essentially, we have \(O(m \times n \times i \times e \times 3^n)\) where `m` is the rows, `n` is the columns, `i` and `e` are the counts of introverts and extroverts, and `3^n` for the possible states of one row considering introverts, extroverts, and empty cells. This makes it quite suitable for typical constraints seen in such competitive programming problems.
