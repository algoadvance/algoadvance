[Leetcode 1879. Minimum XOR Sum of Two Arrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1879)
## Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2 of length n.

The **XOR sum** of the two integer arrays is defined as `(nums1[0] XOR nums2[0]) + (nums1[1] XOR nums2[1]) + ... + (nums1[n-1] XOR nums2[n-1])` where `XOR` is the bitwise XOR operation.

- **Return the minimum XOR sum** of `nums1` and `nums2`.

### Example

```plaintext
Input: nums1 = [1,2], nums2 = [2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: The minimum XOR sum is obtained by:
- (1 XOR 2) + (2 XOR 3) = 3
  or
- (1 XOR 3) + (2 XOR 2) = 2
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on array length and elements:** Can we assume that `1 <= n <= 14` and `0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 4095` as per the description in the LeetCode problem?
2. **Order:** Is the order of the elements in nums1 and nums2 allowed to be rearranged for permutations?
3. **Output:** Should the output be an integer representing the minimum XOR sum?

Once these points are clear, we can devise a strategy to solve the problem efficiently.

## Strategy

### Dynamic Programming with Bitmask

Given the constraints (i.e., maximum length of arrays is 14), a combination of bitmasking and dynamic programming (DP) can be used since there are at most `2^14 = 16384` states per person.

1. **State Representation**:
    - Use a bitmask to represent the states where each bit tells us whether an element in `nums2` has been used or not.
    - The DP array `dp[mask]` represents the minimum XOR sum possible for a given mask of assignments.

2. **Transition**:
    - For each bit in the bitmask (total active bits representing the elements used), find the minimum XOR sum by trying every unused element from `nums2` with `nums1[i]`.

3. **Initialization and Base Case**:
    - `dp[0]` (no elements used) should be 0.

4. **Recursion**:
    - For each DP state, compute the value for new states by adding an unused number from `nums2` to the current combination and keeping track of the minimum sum.

5. **Final Answer**:
    - The final answer will be stored in `dp[(1 << n) - 1]`, which means all elements are used.

## Code

```javascript
function minimumXORSum(nums1, nums2) {
    const n = nums1.length;
    const dp = new Array(1 << n).fill(Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER);
    dp[0] = 0;

    for (let mask = 0; mask < (1 << n); mask++) {
        const used = mask.toString(2).split('0').join('').length;
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << j)) === 0) {
                dp[mask | (1 << j)] = Math.min(dp[mask | (1 << j)], dp[mask] + (nums1[used] ^ nums2[j]));
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[(1 << n) - 1];
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **State Transition**: For each state (bitmask), iterate through all elements in nums2.
- **Total States**: \(2^n\) states, and for each state, we have an \(O(n)\) operation.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \times 2^n)\), which is manageable given \(n \leq 14\).

This approach effectively uses the manageable problem size by integrating bitmasking and dynamic programming to find the minimum XOR sum with an optimal and concise solution.
