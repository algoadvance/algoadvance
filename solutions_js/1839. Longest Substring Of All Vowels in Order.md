[Leetcode 1839. Longest Substring Of All Vowels in Order](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1839)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `word` consisting of lowercase English letters. Determine the length of the longest substring of `word` that is composed of only the vowels 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' and in that order (in other words, it contains any combination of 'a', followed by any combination of 'e', followed by any combination of 'i', followed by any combination of 'o', followed by any combination of 'u').

Return the length of the longest substring that meets this condition. If no such substring exists, return 0.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are we only concerned with non-overlapping substrings or can overlapping substrings also be considered?**
   - We are interested in the longest contiguous substring that satisfies the conditions.

2. **What should we return if there's no valid substring?**
   - Return 0 if there is no valid substring.

3. **Can the input contain other characters besides the vowels?**
   - Yes, and any non-vowel character or vowel not in order interrupts the current substring sequence.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Variables**: Use `max_len` to store the maximum length found and `current_len` to store the current length of the valid substring. Use a variable `current_vowel_index` to track the expected order index of the vowels.
   
2. **Iterate through the string**: Use a for-loop to iterate through each character of the string.
   
3. **Check Vowel Conditions**:
   - If the current character is the same as the expected vowel (`current_vowel_index`), increase the `current_len`.
   - If it's the next vowel in the sequence, update the `current_vowel_index` and reset the `current_len`.
   - For any other character or out-of-order vowel:
     - Compare and update `max_len` with `current_len`.
     - Reset `current_len` to 0 and start checking from the beginning.
   
4. **Update max_len**: Ensure the longest valid substring length is correctly updated by also checking at the end of the iteration.

5. **Return the result**.

### Code

```javascript
function longestBeautifulSubstring(word) {
    let max_len = 0;
    let current_len = 0;
    let current_vowel_index = 0;
    const vowels = "aeiou";

    for (let i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
        let char = word[i];
        if (char === vowels[current_vowel_index]) {
            current_len++;
        } else if (
            current_vowel_index < 4 && char === vowels[current_vowel_index + 1]
        ) {
            current_vowel_index++;
            current_len++;
        } else if (char === 'a') {
            current_vowel_index = 0;
            current_len = 1;
        } else {
            if (current_vowel_index === 4) {
                max_len = Math.max(max_len, current_len);
            }
            current_vowel_index = (char === 'a') ? 0 : -1;
            current_len = (char === 'a') ? 1 : 0;
        }
    }

    if (current_vowel_index === 4) {
        max_len = Math.max(max_len, current_len);
    }

    return max_len;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because we only make a single pass through the string.

- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since we are using a fixed amount of extra space irrespective of the input size.

This solution ensures that we find the longest contiguous substring that meets the criteria efficiently.
