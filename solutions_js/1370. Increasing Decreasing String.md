[Leetcode 1370. Increasing Decreasing String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1370)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s`. Reorder the string using the following algorithm:

1. Pick the smallest character from `s` and append it to the result.
2. Pick the smallest character from `s` which is greater than the last appended character to the result and append it.
3. Repeat step 2 until you cannot pick more characters.
4. Pick the largest character from `s` and append it to the result.
5. Pick the largest character from `s` which is smaller than the last appended character to the result and append it.
6. Repeat step 5 until you cannot pick more characters.
7. Repeat the steps from 1 to 6 until you pick all characters from `s`.

Return the result string after the algorithm.

Example:
- Input: `s = "aaaabbbbcccc"`
- Output: `"abccbaabccba"`

**Note**: The characters of `s` are lower case English letters.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are the characters in the input string guaranteed to be lowercase English letters only?
   - Yes.
2. Is there any limit on the length of the input string?
   - No explicit length limit, but we will assume it fits within typical constraints for a competitive programming problem.

## Strategy

1. We'll use a frequency counter to keep track of the number of each character in `s`.
2. We will repeatedly iterate over the character set from 'a' to 'z' (smallest to largest), appending each character to the result string until no more characters can be added.
3. Similarly, iterate over the character set from 'z' to 'a' (largest to smallest) appending characters.
4. We will continue this process, alternating between the two passes, until all characters are exhausted.

This approach ensures each character is used in accordance with the given rules and efficiently constructs the desired result string.

## Code

```javascript
var sortString = function(s) {
    // Create a frequency map for characters
    let charCount = new Array(26).fill(0);
    for (let char of s) {
        charCount[char.charCodeAt(0) - 97]++;
    }

    let result = [];
    let length = s.length;

    while (result.length < length) {
        // Append characters in increasing order
        for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
            if (charCount[i] > 0) {
                result.push(String.fromCharCode(i + 97));
                charCount[i]--;
            }
        }
        // Append characters in decreasing order
        for (let i = 25; i >= 0; i--) {
            if (charCount[i] > 0) {
                result.push(String.fromCharCode(i + 97));
                charCount[i]--;
            }
        }
    }

    return result.join('');
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. Here's the breakdown:
- Counting the frequency of characters takes `O(n)`.
- Constructing the result string involves potentially iterating over the character set repeatedly, but the inner operations are bounded by the number of characters, so it efficiently completes in linear time relative to the input size.

Thus, the overall complexity is linear, ensuring the algorithm is performant even for longer strings.
