[Leetcode 790. Domino and Tromino Tiling](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l790)
### Problem Statement
We are given two types of tiles: a 2x1 domino and a tromino. A tromino is a shape that's formed by joining three 1x1 squares in an "L" shape. The goal is to determine in how many ways we can tile a 2xN board using these tiles. Return your answer modulo \(10^9 + 7\).

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
    - What is the maximum value for \( N \)?
    - Can \( N \) be zero or negative?

2. **Output**:
    - Should the result be provided modulo \(10^9 + 7\)?

### Plan & Strategy
To solve this problem, dynamic programming (DP) can be effectively used. Define `dp[i]` as the number of ways to completely cover a 2xi board. Considering that we can use both dominos and trominos, the transition between states can be detailed as follows:

1. Using a vertical domino on the leftmost column reduces the problem to a 2x(i-1) board.
2. Using two horizontal dominos stacked reduces the problem to a 2x(i-2) board.
3. Using trominoes involves looking at the board configurations logically. There's a pattern that requires auxiliary states to keep track of configurations.

### State Initialization:
- `dp[0] = 1` (1 way to fill an empty board)
- `dp[1] = 1` (1 way to fill a 2x1 board using one vertical domino)

### State Transition:
```
dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] + 2 * sum(dp[j] for j from 0 to i-3)
```

### Code Implementation
```javascript
var numTilings = function(N) {
    const MOD = 1000000007;

    if (N === 0) return 1;
    if (N === 1) return 1;
    if (N === 2) return 2;

    let dp = new Array(N + 1).fill(0);
    dp[0] = 1;
    dp[1] = 1;
    dp[2] = 2;

    let sum = dp[1]; // sum(dp[j] for j from 0 to i-3)

    for (let i = 3; i <= N; ++i) {
        dp[i] = (dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] + 2 * sum) % MOD;
        sum = (sum + dp[i-2]) % MOD;
    }

    return dp[N];
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
    - O(N): The algorithm uses a single loop that iterates from 3 to N, and each step involves constant-time operations. 
- **Space Complexity**:
    - O(N): The space complexity arises from the array `dp` which stores results for each sub-problem up to N.

This code implements the approach with dynamic programming, ensuring that results are computed efficiently and stored to avoid redundant calculations, making it optimal for larger values of N.
