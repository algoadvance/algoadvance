[Leetcode 3203. Find Minimum Diameter After Merging Two Trees](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3203)
### Problem Statement

You are given two trees as adjacency lists. Each tree has `n1` and `n2` nodes respectively. Your task is to merge these two trees by connecting any node from the first tree with any node from the second tree, and return the minimum possible diameter of the resulting tree. 

A diameter of a tree is the length of the longest path between two nodes in the tree.

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes `n1` and `n2` will not exceed `1000`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input and Output:**
   - **Input:** Two trees given as adjacency lists.
   - **Output:** Minimum possible diameter of the resulting merged tree.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What if one tree is empty? Should we assume thereâ€™s always at least one node in each tree? (Assume yes for simplicity)
   - What if the trees are already single nodes? (The diameter is 0 for single nodes)

3. **Input Format:**
   - How are the trees' adjacency lists provided? (Assume they are provided as arrays of arrays.)

### Strategy

1. **Understanding Diameter Calculation:**
   - The diameter of a tree can be found using two passes of BFS (or DFS). Firstly, find the furthest node from any node `A` and label it `B`. Then from `B`, perform another BFS/DFS to find the furthest node `C`. The distance between `B` and `C` is the diameter.

2. **Finding the Maximum Diameter of a Single Tree:**
   - Use the two-pass BFS strategy to compute the diameter of each tree.

3. **Merging Two Trees:**
   - Connect every possible pair of nodes from the two trees and calculate the resulting diameters.
      - Note that this might be too computationally expensive, so explore the possibility of optimizing by carefully choosing merge connections that minimize the overall diameter.

4. **Optimization Insight:**
   - The minimum diameter after merging two trees will often be driven by the diameters of the individual trees plus one edge to connect them. 
   - Connecting the respective "ends" of the diameters of the two trees should suffice to minimize the overall diameter.

### Code

Let's implement this in JavaScript:

```javascript
function findTreeDiameter(adjList) {
    const bfs = (startNode) => {
        const n = adjList.length;
        const dist = Array(n).fill(-1);
        const queue = [startNode];
        dist[startNode] = 0;
        
        let farthestNode = startNode;
        while (queue.length > 0) {
            const node = queue.shift();
            for (const neighbor of adjList[node]) {
                if (dist[neighbor] === -1) {
                    dist[neighbor] = dist[node] + 1;
                    queue.push(neighbor);
                    if (dist[neighbor] > dist[farthestNode]) {
                        farthestNode = neighbor;
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return [farthestNode, dist[farthestNode]];
    };
    
    const startNode = 0;
    const [farthest1,] = bfs(startNode);
    const [, diameter] = bfs(farthest1);
    return diameter;
}

function findMinimumDiameterAfterMergingTrees(tree1, tree2) {
    const diameter1 = findTreeDiameter(tree1);
    const diameter2 = findTreeDiameter(tree2);
    
    // Minimum diameter merging two trees including one edge
    return Math.max(diameter1, diameter2) + 1;
}

// Example Usage (to be adapted for actual input structure):
// Adjacency list representation of trees

const tree1 = [
  [1],     // Node 0 connected to Node 1
  [0, 2],  // Node 1 connected to Nodes 0 and 2
  [1]      // Node 2 connected to Node 1
];

const tree2 = [
  [1, 2],  // Node 0 connected to Nodes 1 and 2
  [0],     // Node 1 connected to Node 0
  [0]      // Node 2 connected to Node 0
];

const result = findMinimumDiameterAfterMergingTrees(tree1, tree2);
console.log(result);  // It should print the minimum possible diameter.
```

### Time Complexity

- **BFS**: O(V + E) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges.
- The above solution runs a BFS twice for each tree to get the diameter which is O(V + E) for each tree.
- Then we take the maximum and add 1 which is O(1).
- Given tree sizes of up to 1000 nodes, this approach is efficient and should run within limits.

The overall time complexity is:
- **O(V1 + E1) + O(V2 + E2)**, where V1, E1 are nodes and edges in tree1 and V2, E2 for tree2. This should be efficient given the constraints.
