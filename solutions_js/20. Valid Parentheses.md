[Leetcode 20. Valid Parentheses](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l20)
# Problem Statement
The task is to determine if a given string of parentheses is valid. A string is considered valid if:
1. Open brackets must be closed by the same type of brackets.
2. Open brackets must be closed in the correct order.

The types of brackets considered are `()`, `{}`, and `[]`.

# Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input string contain any characters other than `()`, `{}`, and `[]`?
2. Is an empty string considered valid?

Assuming the input string will only contain the characters mentioned and that an empty string is considered valid.

# Strategy
1. Use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets.
2. Traverse the string character by character:
   - If an opening bracket is encountered (`(`, `{`, `[`), push it onto the stack.
   - If a closing bracket is encountered (`)`, `}`, `]`), check whether the type of the closing bracket matches the top element of the stack:
     - If the stack is empty or the top element of the stack does not match, return false.
     - Otherwise, pop the top element from the stack.
3. Finally, if the stack is empty, it means all the opening brackets were matched correctly, so return true. If the stack is not empty, return false.

# Code
```javascript
function isValid(s) {
    // Stack to keep track of the opening brackets
    const stack = [];
    // Mapping of closing to opening brackets
    const bracketMap = {
        ')': '(',
        '}': '{',
        ']': '[',
    };

    for (let char of s) {
        // Check if the character is a closing bracket
        if (bracketMap[char]) {
            // Pop the top element from the stack if not empty, otherwise use a dummy character
            const topElement = stack.length > 0 ? stack.pop() : '#';
            // If the mapping for the closing bracket doesn't match the stack's top element, return false
            if (bracketMap[char] !== topElement) {
                return false;
            }
        } else {
            // It's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack
            stack.push(char);
        }
    }
    // If the stack is empty, all the brackets are matched correctly
    return stack.length === 0;
}
```

# Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input string. Each character in the string is processed exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), in the worst case, the stack will contain all opening brackets if no closing brackets are encountered or if they are all opened before any closing brackets.

This solution efficiently checks the validity of the parentheses string using a stack, ensuring that the brackets are properly nested and closed in the correct order.
