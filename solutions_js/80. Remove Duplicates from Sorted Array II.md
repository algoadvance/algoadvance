[Leetcode 80. Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l80)
### Problem Statement

Given a sorted array `nums`, remove the duplicates in-place such that duplicates appeared at most twice and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array; you must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory.

### Example:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3]
Output: 5, nums = [1,1,2,2,3,_]
```
Here, the length of the updated array is 5, and the first five elements of the array are `1, 1, 2, 2, 3`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Does the array always contain at least one element?
   - For this problem, you can assume the array contains at least one element.
2. What should be returned? The array or the length of the array?
   - Return the new length of the array after removing extra duplicates.

### Strategy
1. **Two Pointers Technique:**
   - Use two pointers â€“ one (`i`) for traversing the array and another (`write_pointer`) for writing the valid elements within the same array.
   - Initialize `write_pointer` at 0, as this will track the position for the next unique or allowed duplicate element.
   - Traverse the array with the pointer `i`. For each element, check if it's valid to write by checking the number of times a similar element can appear (at most twice).
   - Copy the valid elements to positions tracked by the `write_pointer` and then increment the `write_pointer`.

2. **Condition to Allow Element:**
   - To determine if an element at index `i` should be included in the array. Check if `write_pointer` is less than 2 or if `nums[i]` is greater than `nums[write_pointer - 2]`. This ensures no more than two occurrences of any element.

### Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var removeDuplicates = function(nums) {
    if (nums.length <= 2) {
        return nums.length;
    }
    
    let write_pointer = 2; // As the first two elements can always stay
    
    for (let i = 2; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] !== nums[write_pointer - 2]) {
            nums[write_pointer] = nums[i];
            write_pointer++;
        }
    }
    
    return write_pointer;
};

// Example Usage
let nums = [1,1,1,2,2,3];
let length = removeDuplicates(nums);
console.log(length); // Output: 5
console.log(nums.slice(0, length)); // Output: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3]
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the array, as we are iterating through the array only once.
- The space complexity is `O(1)` as we are modifying the array in-place and using only a constant amount of extra space.

This solution effectively removes the duplicates while ensuring each element appears no more than twice, modifying the array directly.
