[Leetcode 301. Remove Invalid Parentheses](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l301)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` that contains parentheses and lowercase letters, you need to remove the minimum number of invalid parentheses to make the input string valid. Return all possible results. The input string may contain letters other than the parentheses (`(` and `)`).

### Example:
1. **Input:** `(a)())()`
   **Output:** [`(a)()()`, `(a())()`]
2. **Input:** `()())()`
   **Output:** [`()()()`, `(())()`]
3. **Input:** `)(`
   **Output:** [`()`]

### Constraints:
- The length of the input string will be in the range `[1, 25]`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the string contain characters other than parentheses and letters?
   - **A:** No, the string will only contain lowercase letters and parentheses.

2. **Q:** Are spaces considered valid characters that need to be preserved?
   - **A:** No mention of spaces in the constraints, so we assume there are no spaces.

3. **Q:** Can the same valid configuration be returned twice in the result list?
   - **A:** No, duplicate configurations should not be present in the result list.

4. **Q:** Are there any performance constraints we should be mindful of given the problem size?
   - **A:** Given the length constraint (up to 25 characters), performance within this bound should be acceptable.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** approach:

1. **Initial Setup:** We start by enqueuing the original string into a queue and initialize a set to keep track of visited strings.
2. **BFS Loop:** We dequeue a string from the queue each time, and check whether it is valid. If valid, add it to the result list. If not valid and we haven't found any valid string at this level, generate all possible strings by removing one parenthesis at a time and enqueue them for the next level of search.
3. **Early Termination:** If at any level we find at least one valid string, it means the smallest number of removals needed has been achieved, and we only process that level.
4. **Validity Check:** A helper function to determine if a given string has balanced parentheses.

## Code

```javascript
function removeInvalidParentheses(s) {
    const result = [];
    let visited = new Set([s]);
    let queue = [s];
    let found = false;

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        let levelSize = queue.length;
        let currentLevel = new Set();

        // Process all nodes at current level
        for (let i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
            let currentString = queue.shift();
            
            if (isValid(currentString)) {
                result.push(currentString);
                found = true;
            }

            if (!found) {
                for (let j = 0; j < currentString.length; j++) {
                    if (currentString[j] !== '(' && currentString[j] !== ')') continue;

                    let newString = currentString.slice(0, j) + currentString.slice(j + 1);
                    if (!visited.has(newString)) {
                        currentLevel.add(newString);
                        visited.add(newString);
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        if (found) break;

        queue = Array.from(currentLevel);
    }

    return result;
}

function isValid(str) {
    let balance = 0;
    for (let char of str) {
        if (char === '(') balance++;
        if (char === ')') balance--;
        if (balance < 0) return false; // More ')' than '('
    }
    return balance === 0; // All '(' should be balanced by ')'
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm can be analyzed as follows:

- Each level of the BFS can generate all possible strings with one fewer parentheses.
- In the worst-case scenario, we could be generating `O(2^n)` strings where `n` is the length of the string.
- Therefore, for each string in `O(2^n)`, the `isValid` function runs in `O(n)` time. 

So, the overall time complexity is **O(n * 2^n)**, which is exponential but acceptable due to the constraints (maximum length of the input string being 25).
