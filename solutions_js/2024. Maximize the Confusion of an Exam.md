[Leetcode 2024. Maximize the Confusion of an Exam](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2024)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `answerKey`, where `answerKey[i]` is 'T' meaning true and 'F' meaning false. In an exam, a student can replace up to `k` answers (change 'T' to 'F' or vice versa) to maximize the number of consecutive same answers ("T" or "F"). Return the maximum number of consecutive 'T's or 'F's that can be achieved.

**Example:**

```
Input: answerKey = "TTFF", k = 2
Output: 4
Explanation: We can replace both the 'F's with 'T's to make the answer key "TTTT".
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the expected output if `k` is greater than the length of the answer key?**
   - In cases where `k` is greater than the length of the answer key, we can just change all characters to the same value, so the result should be the length of the string.

2. **What characters can `answerKey` contain?**
   - The `answerKey` will only contain 'T' and 'F'.

3. **Are there constraints on the length of the `answerKey`?**
   - The length of the `answerKey` and the value of `k` are parameters typically defined in the problem constraints on LeetCode.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a sliding window approach, where we maintain a window that contains at most `k` changes from 'T' to 'F' or vice versa. The goal is to maximize the length of the window. 

We'll perform this sliding window operation twice:
1. To find the maximum length of consecutive 'T's by potentially changing up to `k` 'F's to 'T's.
2. To find the maximum length of consecutive 'F's by potentially changing up to `k` 'T's to 'F's.

The final result will be the maximum length found in these two operations.

## Code

Here's the JavaScript code to solve the problem:

```javascript
function maxConsecutiveAnswers(answerKey, k) {
    // Helper function to find max length of subsequence with at most k changes
    const maxConsecutiveChars = (char) => {
        let maxLen = 0;
        let left = 0;
        let count = 0;

        for (let right = 0; right < answerKey.length; right++) {
            if (answerKey[right] !== char) {
                count++;
            }

            while (count > k) {
                if (answerKey[left] !== char) {
                    count--;
                }
                left++;
            }

            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, right - left + 1);
        }

        return maxLen;
    };

    return Math.max(maxConsecutiveChars('T'), maxConsecutiveChars('F'));
}

// Example usage:
let answerKey = "TTFF";
let k = 2;
console.log(maxConsecutiveAnswers(answerKey, k)); // Output: 4
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `answerKey`. The sliding window approach ensures that each element is processed a limited number of times, making the algorithm efficient for large strings.
