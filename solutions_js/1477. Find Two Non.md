[Leetcode 1477. Find Two Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1477)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, your task is to find the minimum sum of the lengths of two non-overlapping sub-arrays such that the sum of the elements in each sub-array is equal to `target`. If such sub-arrays do not exist, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the array `arr` and the integer `target`?**
   - Constraints: `1 <= arr.length <= 10^5`, `1 <= arr[i] <= 1000`, `1 <= target <= 10^7`.

2. **Can the same element be part of both sub-arrays?**
   - No, the sub-arrays must be non-overlapping.

3. **What should we return if no valid sub-arrays are found?**
   - Return `-1`.

### Strategy

1. **Sliding Window and Hash Map Approach:**
   - Use a sliding window to find sub-arrays with sum equal to `target`.
   - Maintain a hash map to store the smallest lengths of sub-arrays ending before the current position to ensure non-overlap.
   - Traverse the array twice, once from the start and once from the end, to utilize the sub-arrays found both ways.

2. **Steps Involved:**
   - First pass through the array to compute the smallest sub-array ending at each position with a sum of `target`.
   - Second pass in the reverse direction to compute valid pairs of sub-arrays, one ending before the current position found in the first pass and the other starting at/after the current position.

### Code

```javascript
var minSumOfLengths = function(arr, target) {
    const n = arr.length;
    let prefixSum = new Map();
    prefixSum.set(0, -1); // To handle the case when sub-array starts from index 0
    let currentSum = 0;
    let minLength = new Array(n).fill(Infinity);
    let leftMinLength = Infinity;
    let result = Infinity;
    
    // First pass to calculate the minimum length sub-array ending at or before each index
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        currentSum += arr[i];
        
        if (prefixSum.has(currentSum - target)) {
            let startIdx = prefixSum.get(currentSum - target);
            let currLength = i - startIdx;
            minLength[i] = currLength;
            if (startIdx >= 0) {
                leftMinLength = Math.min(leftMinLength, currLength);
            }
        }
        
        prefixSum.set(currentSum, i);
        minLength[i] = Math.min(minLength[i], i > 0 ? minLength[i - 1] : Infinity);
    }
    
    // Second pass to find the minimal sum of lengths of two valid sub-arrays
    currentSum = 0;
    prefixSum.clear();
    prefixSum.set(0, n);
    let rightMinLength = Infinity;
    
    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        currentSum += arr[i];
        
        if (prefixSum.has(currentSum - target)) {
            let endIdx = prefixSum.get(currentSum - target);
            let currLength = endIdx - i;
            rightMinLength = Math.min(rightMinLength, currLength);
            
            if (minLength[i - 1] < Infinity) {
                result = Math.min(result, minLength[i - 1] + rightMinLength);
            }
        }
        
        prefixSum.set(currentSum, i);
    }
    
    return result === Infinity ? -1 : result;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`
  - We iterate through the array twice, which results in a linear time complexity.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)`
  - We use hash maps and additional arrays for storing intermediate results, ensuring linear space complexity as well.
