[Leetcode 997. Find the Town Judge](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l997)
## Problem Statement

In a town, there are `n` people labeled from `1` to `n`. There is a rumor that one of these people is secretly the town judge.

If the town judge exists, then:

1. The town judge trusts nobody.
2. Everybody (except for the town judge) trusts the town judge.
3. There is exactly one person that satisfies properties 1 and 2.

You are given an array `trust` where `trust[i] = [a, b]` representing that person labeled `a` trusts person labeled `b`.

Return the label of the town judge if the town judge exists and can be identified, or return `-1` otherwise.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if `n` is 1?**
   - If `n` is 1, there is no one else to trust the judge. By default, the single person can be considered the judge.
   
2. **Can there be more than one pair `[a, b]` with the same `a` and `b`:**
   - No, each pair `[a, b]` is unique.

3. **Are there any constraints on the value of `n` and the length of `trust`?**
   - Yes, constraints generally are \(1 \leq n \leq 1000\) and \(0 \leq \text{trust.length} \leq 10^4\).


## Strategy

The strategy involves the following steps:
1. If `n` is 1, return 1 because that single person is by default the town judge.
2. Create two arrays `trustCounts` and `trustedByCounts` to keep count of trusts of each person and how many people trust each person respectively.
3. Iterate through the `trust` array and populate the `trustCounts` and `trustedByCounts`.
4. Check if there is any person who trusts nobody (`trustCounts[i] == 0`) and is trusted by exactly `n - 1` people (`trustedByCounts[i] == n - 1`). If found, return that person's label.
5. If no such person is found, return `-1`.

## Code

```javascript
function findJudge(n, trust) {
    if (n === 1) return 1;

    let trustCounts = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    let trustedByCounts = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);

    for (let [a, b] of trust) {
        trustCounts[a]++;
        trustedByCounts[b]++;
    }

    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (trustCounts[i] === 0 && trustedByCounts[i] === n - 1) {
            return i;
        }
    }

    return -1;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(T + N), where `T` is the length of the `trust` array and `N` is the number of people.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), for storing the `trustCounts` and `trustedByCounts` arrays.

This ensures that we efficiently find the town judge by counting the trusts and the number of times each person is trusted.
