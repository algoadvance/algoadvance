[Leetcode 1993. Operations on Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1993)
## Problem Statement

You are given a tree with `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n-1` in the form of a parent array `parents`, where `parents[i]` is the parent of node `i`. The root of the tree is always node `0`, and `parents[0] = -1` since there is no parent for the root node.

Implement a class `LockingTree` that supports the following operations:

1. `lock(num: number, user: number)`: Locks the node `num` for the user `user`. If the node is already locked, the operation should return false. Otherwise, the node will be locked and return true.
2. `unlock(num: number, user: number)`: Unlocks the node `num` for the user `user`. If the node is already unlocked, the operation should return false. Otherwise, it will unlock the node and return true.
3. `upgrade(num: number, user: number)`: Locks the node `num` for the user `user` if the following conditions are met:
   - The node is not locked.
   - It has at least one locked descendant.
   - It does not have any locked ancestor.
   If the upgrade operation is successful, all the descendants of the node `num` should be unlocked.

## Clarifying Questions

1. What values can `num` and `user` have?
2. Can the parent array have nodes other than values from `0` to `n-1`?
3. Will the operations (lock, unlock, upgrade) always be called with valid node numbers in the range `[0, n-1]`?
4. Are multiple operations executed consecutively guaranteed to have consistent states (i.e., no concurrent modifications)?

## Strategy

1. **Data Structures**:
   - Use an array `lockStatus` of size `n` where `lockStatus[i]` keeps the user who has locked node `i` (or `-1` if it is not locked).
   - Use a hashmap to keep track of parent-child relationships for easy descendant access.

2. **Implementation**:
   - The constructor will initialize the `lockStatus` array and generate the ancestors and children relationship maps.
   - `lock` method: Check if the node is already locked, if not, lock it.
   - `unlock` method: Check if the node is locked by the current user, if yes, unlock it.
   - `upgrade` method: Check the conditions (not locked, has locked descendants, no locked ancestors) and perform the upgrade if they are satisfied.

3. **Time Complexity**:
   - `lock` and `unlock` operations are `O(1)` since they involve simple checks and assignments.
   - `upgrade` operation could be up to `O(n)` in the worst case because it needs to check and unlock multiple descendants.

```javascript
class LockingTree {
    constructor(parents) {
        this.n = parents.length;
        this.parents = parents;
        this.lockStatus = new Array(this.n).fill(-1);
        this.children = Array.from({ length: this.n }, () => []);

        // Build the children array
        for (let i = 0; i < this.n; i++) {
            if (parents[i] !== -1) {
                this.children[parents[i]].push(i);
            }
        }
    }

    lock(num, user) {
        if (this.lockStatus[num] !== -1) {
            return false;
        }
        this.lockStatus[num] = user;
        return true;
    }

    unlock(num, user) {
        if (this.lockStatus[num] !== user) {
            return false;
        }
        this.lockStatus[num] = -1;
        return true;
    }

    hasLockedDescendants(num) {
        if (this.lockStatus[num] !== -1) {
            return true;
        }
        for (let child of this.children[num]) {
            if (this.hasLockedDescendants(child)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    unlockAllDescendants(num) {
        this.lockStatus[num] = -1;
        for (let child of this.children[num]) {
            this.unlockAllDescendants(child);
        }
    }

    hasLockedAncestors(num) {
        while (this.parents[num] !== -1) {
            num = this.parents[num];
            if (this.lockStatus[num] !== -1) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }

    upgrade(num, user) {
        if (this.lockStatus[num] !== -1 || !this.hasLockedDescendants(num) || this.hasLockedAncestors(num)) {
            return false;
        }
        this.unlockAllDescendants(num);
        this.lockStatus[num] = user;
        return true;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **`lock` & `unlock`**: O(1)
- **`upgrade`**:
  - Checking if descendants are locked: O(n) in the worst case as it might need to traverse all descendants.
  - Unlocking all descendants: O(n) in the worst case for the same reason.
  - Checking if any ancestors are locked: O(log n) on average, O(n) in the worst case (skewed tree).

Most operations are efficient because they rely on direct index access and recursive traversals that are typical for tree-based structures.
