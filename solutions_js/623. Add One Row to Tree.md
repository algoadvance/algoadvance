[Leetcode 623. Add One Row to Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l623)
### Problem Statement
You are given the `root` of a binary tree and two integers `val` and `depth`, add a row of nodes with value `val` at the given depth `depth`.

- The root node is at depth 1.
- The adding row should be added at the `depth`th level of the binary tree.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: root = [4,2,6,3,1,5], val = 1, depth = 2
Output: [4,1,1,2,null,null,6,3,1,5]
```
```plaintext
Input: root = [4,2,null,3,1], val = 1, depth = 3
Output: [4,2,null,1,1,3,null,null,1]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. What should be done if the depth is 1?
   - If the depth is 1, we should create a new root with the given value and make the original tree its left subtree.

2. Will the values of the nodes always be integers?
   - Yes, you can assume the values are always integers.

3. Can the tree be empty?
   - Yes, the tree can be empty (i.e., root can be `null`).

### Strategy
1. **Base Case:**
   - If `depth` equals `1`, we create a new root with `val` and set its left child to the original root.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - If the depth is greater than `1`, we will use BFS to traverse the tree level by level.
   - When we reach the level just before the desired depth, we will add new nodes with the value `val` as children of the current nodes.

### Code
```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @param {number} val
 * @param {number} depth
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var addOneRow = function(root, val, depth) {
    // Base case when depth is 1
    if (depth === 1) {
        return new TreeNode(val, root, null);
    }

    let queue = [root];
    let currentDepth = 1;

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        let levelSize = queue.length;
        let nextQueue = [];

        if (currentDepth === depth - 1) {
            for (let node of queue) {
                // Add new nodes
                node.left = new TreeNode(val, node.left, null);
                node.right = new TreeNode(val, null, node.right);
            }
            return root;
        }

        for (let i = 0; i < levelSize; i++) {
            let node = queue[i];
            if (node.left) nextQueue.push(node.left);
            if (node.right) nextQueue.push(node.right);
        }

        queue = nextQueue;
        currentDepth++;
    }

    return root;
};
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we might need to traverse all the nodes in the worst case.
- The space complexity is also **O(n)**, due to the queue used for BFS traversal.

This algorithm efficiently adds a new row at the given depth in the binary tree by utilizing BFS traversal to locate the appropriate level before inserting the new nodes.
