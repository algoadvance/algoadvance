[Leetcode 1913. Maximum Product Difference Between Two Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1913)
## Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums`, choose four distinct indices `w`, `x`, `y`, and `z` such that the product difference between the pairs `(nums[w], nums[x])` and `(nums[y], nums[z])` is maximized.

Return the maximum such product difference.

### Example 1:
- **Input:** `nums = [5,6,2,7,4]`
- **Output:** `34`
- **Explanation:** We can choose indices 1 and 3 for the first pair (6, 7) and indices 2 and 4 for the second pair (2, 4) to get the product difference (6 * 7) - (2 * 4) = 42 - 8 = 34.

### Example 2:
- **Input:** `nums = [4,2,5,9,7,4,8]`
- **Output:** `64`
- **Explanation:** We can choose indices 3 and 6 for the first pair (9, 8) and indices 1 and 2 for the second pair (2, 4) to get the product difference (9 * 8) - (2 * 4) = 72 - 8 = 64.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the size of the array or the values within?
   **A:** Yes, the constraints are typically defined as: `4 <= nums.length <= 10^4` and `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`.

2. **Q:** Will the array always contain at least four elements?
   **A:** Yes, according to the problem constraints, `nums` will always contain at least four elements.

3. **Q:** Are negative numbers allowed in the array?
   **A:** No, based on the constraints `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`, all numbers will be positive.

## Strategy
1. **Sorting:**
   - If we sort the array, the two potentially maximum product pairs are:
     - The largest two numbers in `nums`.
     - The smallest two numbers in `nums`.
  
2. **Calculation:**
   - Calculate the product of the two largest numbers.
   - Calculate the product of the two smallest numbers.
   - The maximum product difference will be the difference between these two products.

## Code
```javascript
function maxProductDifference(nums) {
    // Sort the array in ascending order
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    // Calculate the product of the largest two numbers
    const maxProduct = nums[nums.length - 1] * nums[nums.length - 2];
    
    // Calculate the product of the smallest two numbers
    const minProduct = nums[0] * nums[1];
    
    // Return the difference
    return maxProduct - minProduct;
}

// Example usages:
console.log(maxProductDifference([5,6,2,7,4])); // Output: 34
console.log(maxProductDifference([4,2,5,9,7,4,8])); // Output: 64
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting:** The primary operation's time complexity is dominated by sorting the array, which is `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the length of the array.
- **Product Calculation:** After sorting, we perform constant-time operations to calculate the required products and their difference, which is `O(1)`.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`.
