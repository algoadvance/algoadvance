[Leetcode 2078. Two Furthest Houses With Different Colors](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2078)
## Problem Statement

Given an array `colors` where `colors[i]` is the color of the `i`-th house in a row of houses, return the maximum distance between two houses with different colors.

**Example:**

- Input: `colors = [1,1,2,1,1,3,1]`
- Output: `6`

**Constraints:**

- `n == colors.length`
- `2 <= n <= 100`
- `0 <= colors[i] <= 100`
- There are at least two houses with different colors.

---

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the colors represented by numbers only?
   - Yes, the colors are represented by integers.

2. Can we assume the `colors` array will always have at least two houses with different colors?
   - Yes, according to the problem statement, there will always be at least two houses with different colors.

---

## Strategy

1. **Brute Force Method:**
   - We can iterate through each pair `(i, j)` where `i < j` and check if `colors[i]` is different from `colors[j]`.
   - Keep track of the maximum distance `j - i` where `colors[i]` is not equal to `colors[j]`.

2. **Optimized Method:**
   - We can improve this by leveraging the following observations:
     - Check from the start and the end of the array.
     - We start by checking the distance from the first house to any house with a different color.
     - Check from the last house to any house with a different color.
     - The maximum of these distances will be the answer.

---

## Code

I will implement the optimized method as it is more efficient.

```javascript
function maxDistance(colors) {
    let n = colors.length;
    let maxDist = 0;

    // Check from the beginning of the array
    for (let j = n - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
        if (colors[0] != colors[j]) {
            maxDist = Math.max(maxDist, j);
            break;
        }
    }

    // Check from the end of the array
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (colors[n - 1] != colors[i]) {
            maxDist = Math.max(maxDist, n - 1 - i);
            break;
        }
    }

    return maxDist;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of the above approach is \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the length of the `colors` array.
  - This is because in the worst case, we might need to iterate through the array twice.
- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as we only use a few extra variables.

---

This optimized solution ensures that we efficiently find the maximum distance between two houses with different colors with a linear scan, making it suitable even as the input size increases.
