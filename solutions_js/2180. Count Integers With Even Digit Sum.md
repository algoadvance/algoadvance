[Leetcode 2180. Count Integers With Even Digit Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2180)
### Problem Statement

Given a positive integer `num`, return the number of positive integers less than or equal to `num` whose digit sums are even.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of `num`:** What is the range of the input `num`? 
   - **Assumption:** `num` is a positive integer and we can assume it fits within standard integer range constraints for typical coding problems (e.g., 32-bit integer).

2. **Definition of "digit sum":** Can we assume "digit sum" refers to the sum of all individual digits in a number?
   - Yes, the digit sum is the sum of all individual digits in a given integer.

3. **Output:** Do we need to count only the integers up to `num` inclusive or exclusive?
   - The output is the count of integers with even digit sums that are less than or equal to `num`.

With the problem understood, let's move to the code strategy.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate through each integer from 1 to `num`.**
2. **For each integer, calculate the sum of its digits.**
3. **Check if the digit sum is even.**
4. **If the digit sum is even, increment the count.**
5. **Return the count.**

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity will be O(n * d), where `n` is the value of `num` and `d` represents the number of digits in each integer.
  - In the worst case, we would be iterating from 1 to `num` and for each integer, summing its digits.
  
### Code

```javascript
function countEven(num) {
    let count = 0;

    // Helper function to compute digit sum
    function digitSum(n) {
        let sum = 0;
        while (n > 0) {
            sum += n % 10;
            n = Math.floor(n / 10);
        }
        return sum;
    }

    for (let i = 1; i <= num; i++) {
        if (digitSum(i) % 2 === 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Helper Function (digitSum):** 
   - Takes an integer `n` and computes the sum of its digits by extracting each digit using `%` operator and integer division (`/`).

2. **Main Function (countEven):** 
   - Initializes the `count` to 0.
   - Iterates over each integer from 1 to `num`.
   - For each integer, calls the `digitSum` function to get the sum of digits.
   - Checks if the digit sum is even and increments the count if true.
   - Returns the final count.

This approach ensures that every number up to `num` is checked efficiently, and the count is accurately returned.
