[Leetcode 2933. High](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2933)
### Problem Statement

Given a list of employee IDs and access logs showing the number of times each employee has accessed a secure system, return a list of IDs of the top `k` employees who have accessed the system the most.

Each entry in the access logs consists of an employee ID and a count representing the number of times the employee accessed the system. You need to identify the `k` employees with the highest access counts and return their IDs.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be done in case of ties in the number of accesses?**
   - Typically, you can return any `k` employees among the ones tied in the number of accesses. The problem does not seem to specify a specific order.

2. **Are the access logs guaranteed to have unique employee IDs, or can an employee appear multiple times?**
   - Usually, you would sum up the accesses for each employee ID if they can appear multiple times.

3. **What data type should be used for input and output?**
   - Input:
     - `logs`: Array of Objects where each object contains `{id: integer, accesses: integer}`
     - `k`: An integer
   - Output:
     - An array of integers, which are the top `k` employee IDs.

### Strategy

1. **Aggregate the Access Counts:**
   - Use a dictionary/hashmap to sum the accesses for each unique employee ID.

2. **Sort and Select the Top `k`:**
   - Convert the dictionary to an array of key-value pairs.
   - Sort the array based on access counts in descending order.
   - Select the top `k` employee IDs from the sorted array.

### Code

```javascript
function topKHighAccessEmployees(logs, k) {
    const accessCounts = {};

    // Aggregate access counts for each employee
    for (let log of logs) {
        if (accessCounts[log.id] == undefined) {
            accessCounts[log.id] = 0;
        }
        accessCounts[log.id] += log.accesses;
    }

    // Convert dictionary to an array of [id, totalAccesses] pairs
    const accessArray = Object.entries(accessCounts).map(([id, accesses]) => ({
        id: parseInt(id),
        accesses: accesses
    }));

    // Sort the array based on access counts in descending order
    accessArray.sort((a, b) => b.accesses - a.accesses);

    // Select the top 'k' employee IDs
    return accessArray.slice(0, k).map(entry => entry.id);
}

// Example usage
const logs = [
    {id: 1, accesses: 5},
    {id: 2, accesses: 3},
    {id: 1, accesses: 2},
    {id: 3, accesses: 4},
    {id: 3, accesses: 1}
];
const k = 2;
const result = topKHighAccessEmployees(logs, k);
console.log(result); // Should print top k employee IDs
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Aggregating Access Counts:** 
   - This step involves iterating over the `logs` array, resulting in a time complexity of `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of entries in `logs`.

2. **Sorting the Array:**
   - Sorting the array of employee access counts takes `O(m log m)`, where `m` is the number of unique employee IDs.

3. **Selecting the Top `k`:**
   - Slicing the sorted array and mapping it to get the top `k` IDs is done in `O(k)` time.

Overall, the time complexity of the solution is `O(n + m log m)`.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space used for the dictionary is `O(m)`.
  - The space used for the array of employee counts is `O(m)`.

Thus, the overall space complexity is `O(m)`.
