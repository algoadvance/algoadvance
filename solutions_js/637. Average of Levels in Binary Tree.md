[Leetcode 637. Average of Levels in Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l637)
## Problem Statement

Given a binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array.

For example:
```
Input:
    3
   / \
  9  20
     / \
    15  7
Output: [3, 14.5, 11]
Explanation:
The average value of nodes on level 0 is 3, on level 1 is 14.5, and on level 2 is 11. Hence, we return [3, 14.5, 11].
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Node Values**: Are the node values constrained to certain ranges (e.g., integer or floating-point ranges)?
2. **Tree Depth**: Is there any constraint on the depth of the tree?
3. **Output Format**: Should the averages be rounded, and if so, to what precision?
4. **Edge Cases**: Are there considerations for edge cases like an empty tree?

## Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: Use BFS to traverse the tree level by level. This traversal method is well-suited for calculating the average of levels.
2. **Queue Data Structure**: Utilize a queue to facilitate level-order traversal.
3. **Accumulator for Each Level**: Maintain a list of sums and counts for each level to compute the respective averages.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. **Initialization**: Check if the tree is empty. If it is, return an empty array.
2. **Queue Setup**: Initialize a queue with the root node and its level (0).
3. **BFS Traversal**: While the queue is not empty:
   - Dequeue the current node and its level.
   - Add the node value to the sum corresponding to its level.
   - Count the nodes at each level.
   - Enqueue the children of the current node with the incremented level.
4. **Calculate Averages**: Once the BFS traversal is complete, compute the average for each level using the accumulated sums and counts.
5. **Return Result**: Return the list of averages.

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {number[]}
 */
const averageOfLevels = function(root) {
    if (!root) return [];

    let averages = [];
    let queue = [[root, 0]];
    let sums = [];
    let counts = [];
    
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        let [node, level] = queue.shift();
        
        if (sums[level] == null) {
            sums[level] = 0;
            counts[level] = 0;
        }
        
        sums[level] += node.val;
        counts[level] += 1;
        
        if (node.left) queue.push([node.left, level + 1]);
        if (node.right) queue.push([node.right, level + 1]);
    }
    
    for (let i = 0; i < sums.length; i++) {
        averages.push(sums[i] / counts[i]);
    }
    
    return averages;
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes. This is due to the additional space required for the queue in the worst case (when the tree is completely unbalanced).

This solution effectively computes the level averages with an optimal traversal approach.
