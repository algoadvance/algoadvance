[Leetcode 553. Optimal Division](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l553)
## Problem Statement:
You are given an integer array `nums`. The operation `nums[i] / nums[i+1] / ... / nums[j]` with `i <= j` groups the elements of the array from index `i` to index `j` and calculates the result of their division in left-to-right order. For example, if you have `nums = [1000, 100, 10, 2]`, the result of `nums[1] / nums[2] / nums[3]` is `100 / 10 / 2`.

You need to find the maximum possible result of the division by grouping the elements of the array optimally, and return the string representation of the expression that achieves this maximum result. 

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Is the array `nums` guaranteed to have at least one integer in it?
2. Are the integers in `nums` always positive?
3. Is there any upper limit on the size of `nums`?

Assuming that the answers to the questions are:
1. Yes
2. Yes
3. No specific upper limit given but should be reasonable for algorithm's efficiency.

## Strategy:
To maximize the result of the given operation (grouping and division), we need to understand how division works. In a division sequence, placing an extra pair of parentheses can dramatically affect the result. Therefore, to achieve the maximum result:
- The first element should be divided by the second divided by all subsequent elements.
- This is equivalent to minimizing the denominator in one big division operation.

For instance, the optimal division for `[1000, 100, 10, 2]` is `1000 / (100 / 10 / 2)` which simplifies to `1000 / ( 100 / (10 / 2)) == 1000 / (100 / 5) = 1000 / 20 = 50`.

**Generalizing this:
1. If `nums` has only one element, then it is directly the result.
2. If `nums` has two elements, then just divide the first by the second.
3. If `nums` has more than two elements, place the parentheses after the first number, i.e., `nums[0] / (nums[1] / nums[2] / ... / nums[n-1])`.

With this approach, we can easily find the optimal string representation.

## Code:
```javascript
function optimalDivision(nums) {
    if (nums.length === 1) {
        return nums[0].toString();
    }
    if (nums.length === 2) {
        return nums[0] + "/" + nums[1];
    }
    let result = nums[0] + "/(" + nums[1];
    for (let i = 2; i < nums.length; i++) {
        result += "/" + nums[i];
    }
    result += ")";
    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity:
- The time complexity of this approach is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the array `nums`, because we traverse the array once to construct the resulting string.
- The space complexity is also `O(n)` due to the storage used for the resulting string.
