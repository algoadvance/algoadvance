[Leetcode 1658. Minimum Operations to Reduce X to Zero](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1658)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `x`. In one operation, you can either remove the leftmost or the rightmost element from the array `nums`. Your goal is to reduce `x` to exactly `0` and choose the minimum number of operations required. If it's not possible, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the size of the array or the values within the array?**
    - The length of the array is between 1 and 100,000.
    - The values within the array and `x` are between 0 and 10^9.

2. **Can `nums` contain negative numbers?**
    - According to the problem constraints, `nums` contains only non-negative numbers.

3. **Is there always a solution?**
    - No, if it's not possible to achieve `x`, we should return `-1`.

### Strategy

Instead of directly thinking in terms of removing elements from both ends, we can reformulate this problem into finding the longest subarray whose sum equals `sum(nums) - x`. 

Here's the strategy step-by-step:
1. Calculate the total sum of the array.
2. Compute the target as `total_sum - x`.
3. Use a sliding window or two-pointer approach to find the longest subarray whose sum is equal to the target.
4. If we find such subarray, the minimum operations required are `n - length_of_that_subarray`.

#### Pseudocode:
1. Calculate the total sum of `nums`.
2. Initialize `target` as `total_sum - x`.
3. If `target` is negative, return `-1` because it's impossible to achieve.
4. Initialize variables for the sliding window (`current_sum`, `left`, `max_length`).
5. Traverse through the array with a loop to adjust the window.
6. If a valid subarray is found (`current_sum == target`), update the `max_length`.
7. If no valid subarray is found, return `-1`; else, return `n - max_length`.

### Code

```javascript
function minOperations(nums, x) {
    const totalSum = nums.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
    const target = totalSum - x;
    const n = nums.length;
    
    if (target < 0) return -1;  // If target is less than zero, it's impossible.
    
    let left = 0;
    let currentSum = 0;
    let maxLength = -1;
    
    for (let right = 0; right < n; right++) {
        currentSum += nums[right];
        
        while (currentSum > target && left <= right) {
            currentSum -= nums[left];
            left++;
        }
        
        if (currentSum === target) {
            maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
        }
    }
    
    return maxLength === -1 ? -1 : n - maxLength;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`. This is because each element is added and removed from the `currentSum` exactly once using the sliding window method.

In summary, the sliding window approach ensures that we traverse the array in linear time, making this solution efficient even for the largest constraints.
