[Leetcode 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l222)
## Problem Statement
You are given the root of a complete binary tree. You need to write a function to count the number of nodes in the tree. 

In a complete binary tree, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and `2^h` nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.

Example 1:
```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 6
```

Example 2:
```
Input: root = []
Output: 0
```

Constraints:
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5 * 10^4]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 10^4`
- The tree is guaranteed to be complete.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Format**: How is the tree input typically structured (e.g., list, TreeNode class)?
   - The tree input is typically structured using a TreeNode class.

2. **Edge Cases**: Do we need to consider edge cases like a single-node tree or completely empty tree?
   - Yes, consider edge cases such as an empty tree and a single-node tree.

Here's the TreeNode class definition for clarity:
```javascript
function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
    this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
    this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
    this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
}
```

## Strategy
The solution leverages the properties of a complete binary tree. The basic approach is:
1. **Height Calculation**: Calculate the height of the leftmost and rightmost path. If both heights are the same, then the subtree is a perfect binary tree.
2. **Counting Nodes Efficiently**: 
   - If the heights are the same, calculate the number of nodes using the formula, `2^height - 1`.
   - If the heights are different, recursively count the nodes in the left and right subtrees.

This approach ensures that we efficiently reduce the problem size using properties of the tree, achieving a time complexity better than O(N).

## Time Complexity
The time complexity is O(log^2 N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This results from the fact that the height computation for each subtree is O(log N) and we perform such computations log N times.

## Code
Here's the code implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function countNodes(root) {
    if (!root) return 0;
    
    // Helper function to calculate height of the tree
    function getHeight(node) {
        let height = 0;
        while (node !== null) {
            height++;
            node = node.left;
        }
        return height;
    }
    
    let leftHeight = getHeight(root.left);
    let rightHeight = getHeight(root.right);
    
    if (leftHeight === rightHeight) {
        return (1 << leftHeight) + countNodes(root.right);
    } else {
        return (1 << rightHeight) + countNodes(root.left);
    }
}
```

## Explanation
1. **Base Case**: If the tree is empty (`root` is `null`), return `0`.
2. **Height Calculation**: 
   - `getHeight(node)` calculates the height by traversing the leftmost path.
3. **Perfect Binary Tree Check**:
   - Compare heights of the left and right subtrees:
     - If equal, then the left subtree is a perfect binary tree.
     - Use bitwise shift `1 << leftHeight` to calculate `2^leftHeight`, add the node count from the right subtree.
     - If not equal, apply the same logic recursively with adjusted subtrees.
   
This approach ensures an efficient counting mechanism specifically utilizing the properties of complete binary trees.
