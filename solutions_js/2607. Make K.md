[Leetcode 2607. Make K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2607)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You can perform the following operation any number of times:

1. Choose any k-length subarray of `nums` and increment each element by 1.

Your goal is to make the sums of all k-length subarrays equal. Return the minimum number of operations required to achieve this goal.

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= k <= nums.length`
- `0 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

## Clarifying Questions

1. Is it guaranteed that it's always possible to make all k-length subarray sums equal?
2. If `k` is equal to `nums.length`, do we consider the entire array as a k-length subarray?
3. What should be returned if all k-length subarray sums are already equal?

## Strategy

To approach this problem, we need to ensure all k-length subarrays have the same sum. Hereâ€™s a clear strategy to solve the problem:

1. **Identify Groups**:
   - Notice that each position `i` in `nums` affects several k-length subarrays differently. But these are cyclic in nature due to pattern repetitions. Positions `(i + k) % nums.length` form groups that need to be handled together.

2. **Group Elements by Modulus**:
   - We group the elements based on their indices modulo `k`. Each group will have indices that are congruent modulo `k`.

3. **Balance Groups**:
   - For each group, to minimize operations, we need the elements to be balanced. For this, we can use the median of the group which would yield the minimum movement cost.

4. **Calculate the Operations**:
   - Calculate the number of operations needed to make all elements in a group equal to their median.
   - Sum up these operations across all groups to get the total minimum operations required.

## Code

Based on the strategy described, let's implement the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function minOperations(nums, k) {
    const groups = Array.from({ length: k }, () => []);

    // Group elements based on index % k
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
        groups[i % k].push(nums[i]);
    }
    
    let totalOps = 0;

    // Process each group
    for (const group of groups) {
        group.sort((a, b) => a - b);
        const median = group[Math.floor(group.length / 2)];
        
        // Calculate operations needed to make all elements in this group equal to the median
        for (const num of group) {
            totalOps += Math.abs(num - median);
        }
    }
    
    return totalOps;
}

// Example usage:
const nums = [1, 2, 2, 1, 2, 1];
const k = 3;
console.log(minOperations(nums, k)); // Expected output will vary based on the array structure
```

## Time Complexity

- **Grouping**: O(n), where n is the length of `nums`, to distribute elements into groups based on their indices.
- **Sorting**: O(k * (n/k) log (n/k))  -> which is O(n log (n/k)), as each group has approximately `n/k` elements.
- **Operations Calculation**: O(n), as we need to sum up the differences for all grouped elements.

So, the overall time complexity approximately simplifies to **O(n log n)**.
