[Leetcode 385. Mini Parser](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l385)
### Problem Statement

Given a nested list of integers represented as a string, implement a parser to deserialize it into a nested list of integers.

Each element is either an integer, or a list â€“ whose elements may also be integers or other lists.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are there any constraints on the size of the input string?
   - It is generally within reasonable limits for a standard coding problem (e.g., fit within available memory).
2. Can the input string be malformed?
   - For the scope of this problem, assume the input string is always well-formed.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can utilize a stack to help manage the nested list structure. We'll iterate through each character of the input string and use the following approach:

1. When we encounter `[`, we start a new nested list and push it onto the stack.
2. When we encounter `]`, we pop the top list from the stack and add it to the list below it.
3. When we encounter digits or a negative sign, we read the full number until we encounter a non-digit character and then add the number to the nested list on the stack.
4. Handle commas by simply ignoring them as they are delimiters.

### Code

Here is the JavaScript code that implements this strategy:

```javascript
function deserialize(s) {
    if (!s) return null;

    let stack = [];
    let numStr = '';
    let negative = false;
    let result = null; // The final result

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        let char = s[i];
        
        if (char === '[') {
            // Start reading a new list
            let newList = [];
            if (stack.length > 0) {
                stack[stack.length - 1].push(newList);
            }
            stack.push(newList);
        } else if (char === ']') {
            // End of list, pop from stack
            if (numStr) {
                stack[stack.length - 1].push(negative ? -parseInt(numStr) : parseInt(numStr));
                numStr = '';
                negative = false;
            }
            result = stack.pop();
        } else if (char === ',') {
            // Ignore comma but check if there's a number to add to list
            if (numStr) {
                stack[stack.length - 1].push(negative ? -parseInt(numStr) : parseInt(numStr));
                numStr = '';
                negative = false;
            }
        } else if (char === '-') {
            // Read negative sign
            negative = true;
        } else {
            // Read number
            numStr += char;
        }
    }
    
    // Handles case of single number string input
    if (numStr) {
        return negative ? -parseInt(numStr) : parseInt(numStr);
    }

    return result;
}

// Example
console.log(deserialize("[123,[456,[789]]]")); // Output: [123, [456, [789]]]
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(n) where `n` is the number of characters in the input string. This is because each character is processed exactly once during the iteration over the string.

### Explanation

1. **Stack Initialization**: We initialize a stack to keep track of the current nested list we are building.
2. **Character By Character Processing**:
   - '[': Push a new list onto the stack.
   - ']': Pop the completed list and attach it to the list below it in the stack.
   - ',': If there's a number accumulated, convert and push it to the current list.
   - '-': Set flag to indicate the number is negative.
   - Digits: Accumulate the digits to form the complete number.
3. **Final Checks**: After processing all characters, if there's a number at the end of the string, handle the single number case.

This method ensures the input string is efficiently parsed into the desired nested list structure.
