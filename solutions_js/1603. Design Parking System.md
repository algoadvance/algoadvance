[Leetcode 1603. Design Parking System](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1603)
### Problem Statement:
Design a parking system for a parking lot. There are three types of parking spaces: big, medium, and small. The number of each type of parking space is given when the parking lot is created. Implement the `ParkingSystem` class:

- `ParkingSystem(int big, int medium, int small)` Initializes object of the `ParkingSystem` class. The number of slots for each parking space are given as part of the constructor.
- `bool addCar(int carType)` Checks whether there is a parking space of the corresponding `carType` for the car that wants to get into the parking lot. `carType` can be 1 (big), 2 (medium), or 3 (small). A car can only park in a specific space if it is available. If a car parks successfully, `addCar` returns true; otherwise, it returns false.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Should the code handle invalid `carType` values? (e.g., `carType` other than 1, 2, or 3)
2. Can the input values for the number of parking spaces be negative?
3. Will the system be expected to handle concurrent access in a multi-threaded environment?

### Strategy:
1. **Initialization:** Use three counters to keep track of the available parking spaces for big, medium, and small cars.
2. **addCar Method:** Check the car type and decrease the corresponding counter if there is available parking. Return true if successful, otherwise return false.

### Code:
```javascript
class ParkingSystem {
    constructor(big, medium, small) {
        this.big = big;
        this.medium = medium;
        this.small = small;
    }

    addCar(carType) {
        if (carType === 1) { // Big car
            if (this.big > 0) {
                this.big--;
                return true;
            }
        } else if (carType === 2) { // Medium car
            if (this.medium > 0) {
                this.medium--;
                return true;
            }
        } else if (carType === 3) { // Small car
            if (this.small > 0) {
                this.small--;
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false; // No parking space available for this car type
    }
}

// Example usage:
let parkingSystem = new ParkingSystem(1, 1, 0);
console.log(parkingSystem.addCar(1)); // return true because there is 1 available slot for a big car
console.log(parkingSystem.addCar(2)); // return true because there is 1 available slot for a medium car
console.log(parkingSystem.addCar(3)); // return false because there is no available slot for a small car
console.log(parkingSystem.addCar(1)); // return false because there is no available slot for a big car, it is already occupied.
```

### Time Complexity:
- The `addCar` method runs in O(1) time since we are performing a constant-time check and update operation. 
- The space complexity is O(1) for storing the counts of the available parking spaces.

This approach ensures efficient and straightforward management of parking operations, adhering to the problem constraints.
