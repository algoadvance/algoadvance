## Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 1192: `Critical Connections in a Network`

You are given an undirected connected network graph with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n-1`, and an array `connections` where `connections[i] = [ai, bi]` represents a connection between nodes `ai` and `bi`. Any two nodes are either directly connected by a single connection or through multiple connections. 

A critical connection is an edge that, if removed, will make some nodes unable to reach some other nodes.

Return all critical connections in the network in any order.

### Example
```
Input: n = 4, connections = [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]]
Output: [[1,3]]
```

### Constraints
- `1 <= n <= 10^5`
- `n-1 <= connections.length <= 10^5`
- `connections[i][0] != connections[i][1]`
- There are no repeated connections.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any cycles in the graph?**
   - Yes, there can be cycles.
   
2. **Can the graph be disconnected?**
   - No, the problem states the graph is connected.

3. **Is there a specific order required for the output?**
   - No, the output can be in any order.

4. **Can there be parallel edges between the same pair of nodes?**
   - No, there are no repeated connections.

## Strategy

We can solve this problem using **Tarjan's algorithm for finding bridges in a graph**. The algorithm utilizes Depth First Search (DFS). Here’s a step-by-step breakdown:

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the graph.

2. **DFS Traversal**:
   - Maintain a discovery time array (`disc`) to keep track of the visit time of nodes.
   - Maintain a low link value array (`low`) to store the earliest visited vertex (the vertex with the minimum discovery time) that is reachable from the subtree rooted with the node.

3. **Identify Bridges**:
   - During DFS, for each node, update its low-link value. If for an edge (u, v), the low value of v is greater than the discovery time of u, then (u, v) is a bridge (critical connection).

4. **Edge Case**:
   - Handle the edge case where the graph has only one connection. Return that as the critical connection.

## Code

```javascript
function criticalConnections(n, connections) {
    let adjList = new Array(n).fill(0).map(() => []);
    
    // Build the graph
    for (let [u, v] of connections) {
        adjList[u].push(v);
        adjList[v].push(u);
    }
    
    let disc = new Array(n).fill(-1);
    let low = new Array(n).fill(-1);
    let visited = new Array(n).fill(false);
    let time = 0;
    let bridges = [];
    
    function dfs(u, parent) {
        visited[u] = true;
        disc[u] = low[u] = time++;
        
        for (let v of adjList[u]) {
            if (v === parent) continue; // Skip the edge that leads back to the parent
            if (!visited[v]) {
                dfs(v, u);
                low[u] = Math.min(low[u], low[v]);
                
                if (low[v] > disc[u]) {
                    bridges.push([u, v]);
                }
            } else {
                low[u] = Math.min(low[u], disc[v]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Call DFS for every unvisited node (handle the case for multiple components as well)
    for (let i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (!visited[i]) dfs(i, -1);
    }
    
    return bridges;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(criticalConnections(4, [[0,1],[1,2],[2,0],[1,3]]));  // Output: [[1, 3]]
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. Each vertex and edge is processed once in the DFS.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V + E) for the adjacency list and recursion stack.

This approach efficiently finds all critical connections in the network using DFS and Tarjan’s algorithm.
