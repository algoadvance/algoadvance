[Leetcode 329. Longest Increasing Path in a Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l329)
## Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` matrix `matrix`, return the length of the longest increasing path in `matrix`.

From each cell, you can either move in four directions: left, right, up, and down. You may not move diagonally or move outside the boundary (i.e., wrap-around is not allowed).

### Example 1:
```
Input: matrix = [[9,9,4],[6,6,8],[2,1,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing path is [1, 2, 6, 9].
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: matrix = [[3,4,5],[3,2,6],[2,2,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing path is [3, 4, 5, 6]. Moving diagonally is not allowed.
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: matrix = [[1]]
Output: 1
```

### Constraints:
- `m == matrix.length`
- `n == matrix[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 200`
- `0 <= matrix[i][j] <= 2^31 - 1`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can each cell in the matrix have negative values?
   - No, based on the constraints, the matrix has only non-negative values.
2. Do we need to track the actual path, or just the length of the path?
   - We only need to return the length of the longest increasing path.

## Strategy
1. **Depth-First Search (DFS) with Memoization**:
   - Traverse each cell in the matrix and use DFS to explore all possible paths.
   - Use a memoization table to store the length of the longest path starting from each cell to avoid re-computation.
   
2. **Base Cases**:
   - If a cell is out of the matrix boundary.
   - If the next cell value is less than or equal to the current cell value.
   
3. **Recursively Compute**:
   - Traverse neighbors (up, down, left, right).
   - If the neighbor has not been visited, compute its longest path and update the memoization table.
   
4. **Result**:
   - The result will be the maximum value in the memoization table.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} matrix
 * @return {number}
 */
var longestIncreasingPath = function(matrix) {
    if (!matrix || matrix.length === 0) return 0;
    
    let m = matrix.length;
    let n = matrix[0].length;
    
    // Memoization table
    let memo = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(null));
    
    function dfs(x, y) {
        if (memo[x][y] !== null) return memo[x][y];
        
        let directions = [[0, 1], [1, 0], [0, -1], [-1, 0]];
        let maxLength = 1;
        
        for (let [dx, dy] of directions) {
            let newX = x + dx;
            let newY = y + dy;
            
            if (newX >= 0 && newX < m && newY >= 0 && newY < n && matrix[newX][newY] > matrix[x][y]) {
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, 1 + dfs(newX, newY));
            }
        }
        
        memo[x][y] = maxLength;
        return maxLength;
    }
    
    let result = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            result = Math.max(result, dfs(i, j));
        }
    }
    
    return result;
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the matrix. Each cell is visited once and its neighbors are checked.
  
- **Space Complexity**: `O(m * n)`, for the memoization table holding the results of subproblems. Additionally, recursion stack space may go up to `O(m * n)` in the worst case.
