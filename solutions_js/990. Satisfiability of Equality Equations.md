[Leetcode 990. Satisfiability of Equality Equations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l990)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `equations` where each string `equations[i]` is of length 4 and takes one of two different forms: `"a==b"` or `"a!=b"`. Here, `a` and `b` are lowercase letters (not necessarily distinct) that represent variables.

Return `true` if it is possible to assign integers to variable names so as to satisfy all the given equations, or `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we have multiple independent sets of equations?**
   - Yes, the problem can have multiple independent sets of variables. 

2. **Will the input always be valid, i.e., always have the correct form and length?**
   - Yes, the input will always be valid and in the form of either `a==b` or `a!=b`.

3. **How large can the input array be?**
   - The length of the `equations` array will be between 1 and 500.

### Strategy

We can use the Union-Find (Disjoint Set Union, DSU) data structure to solve this problem. Here's the step-by-step strategy:

1. **Union Process:** First, process all equations of the form `"a==b"`. For these equations, we need to union the sets containing `a` and `b`.

2. **Check Process:** Next, process all equations of the form `"a!=b"`. For these equations, if `a` and `b` are in the same set, then the equations are contradictory, and we should return `false`.

3. **Final Result:** If all checks pass, return `true`.

### Code

Let's implement this solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
class UnionFind {
    constructor(size) {
        this.parent = new Array(size).fill(0).map((_, index) => index);
        this.rank = new Array(size).fill(1);
    }

    find(x) {
        if (this.parent[x] !== x) {
            this.parent[x] = this.find(this.parent[x]);  // path compression
        }
        return this.parent[x];
    }

    union(x, y) {
        let rootX = this.find(x);
        let rootY = this.find(y);

        if (rootX !== rootY) {
            if (this.rank[rootX] > this.rank[rootY]) {
                this.parent[rootY] = rootX;
            } else if (this.rank[rootX] < this.rank[rootY]) {
                this.parent[rootX] = rootY;
            } else {
                this.parent[rootY] = rootX;
                this.rank[rootX] += 1;
            }
        }
    }
}

var equationsPossible = function(equations) {
    const uf = new UnionFind(26);  // one entry for each lowercase letter, which is 26 letters
    const aCharCode = 'a'.charCodeAt(0);

    // First pass: process all '==' equations
    for (let equation of equations) {
        if (equation[1] === '=') {
            let x = equation[0].charCodeAt(0) - aCharCode;
            let y = equation[3].charCodeAt(0) - aCharCode;
            uf.union(x, y);
        }
    }

    // Second pass: process all '!=' equations
    for (let equation of equations) {
        if (equation[1] === '!') {
            let x = equation[0].charCodeAt(0) - aCharCode;
            let y = equation[3].charCodeAt(0) - aCharCode;
            if (uf.find(x) === uf.find(y)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
    }

    return true;
};

// Example usage
let equations = ["a==b", "b!=a"];
console.log(equationsPossible(equations)); // Output: false
```

### Time Complexity

- **Union-Find Operations:** The Union-Find operations (find and union) are nearly O(1) with path compression and union by rank.
- **First Pass:** We iterate over the equations, each operation is nearly O(1), hence O(N).
- **Second Pass:** Again, iterating over the equations with nearly O(1) operations, hence O(N).

Overall, the time complexity is O(N), where N is the number of equations. 

This solution efficiently checks whether the given equations are satisfiable with the help of the Union-Find data structure.
