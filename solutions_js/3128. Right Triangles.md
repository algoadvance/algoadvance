[Leetcode 3128. Right Triangles](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3128)
## Problem Statement

Given a list of integer coordinates representing points on a 2D grid, return the count of unique right angle triangles that can be formed by these points such that:

1. The right-angle vertex of the triangle is at the origin (0, 0).
2. The other two vertices of the triangle are from the provided list of points.
3. The triangle sides should be perpendicular to the x or y axes.

Assume the input is a list of points, and each point can be represented as an array of two integers `[x, y]`.

**Example:**

Input:
```javascript
[[1,0], [0,1], [1,1], [2,0], [0,2], [2,2]]
```

Output:
```javascript
8
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Will the points always be positive integers?** 
   - Points can be positive or negative integers as they are coordinates on a 2D grid.

2. **Can points coincide with each other (i.e., multiple identical points)?**
   - Yes, but each point is considered independently. Coinciding points are treated as multiple points.

3. **Can we assume that the input is always a non-empty array of points?**
   - Yes, the input will always have points in it.

4. **Does the order of the points matter in the output?**
   - No, the order does not matter. We are simply counting the number of valid triangles.

## Strategy

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create two dictionaries: `xCount` to count occurrences of x-coordinates and `yCount` to count occurrences of y-coordinates.

2. **Count Coordinates:**
   - Iterate through the points and populate the `xCount` and `yCount` dictionaries.

3. **Calculate Right Triangles:**
   - For each point `[x, y]` in the points array:
     - If `x` and `y` are both non-zero, count the potential triangles formed by using the counts from `xCount` and `yCount`.
     - Compute contributions as `(xCount[x] - 1) * (yCount[y] - 1)`.
     - Sum these values to get the total number of valid right-angled triangles.

4. **Return the Total Count:**
   - Return the total count of right-angled triangles.

## Code

```javascript
function countRightTriangles(points) {
    const xCount = {};
    const yCount = {};

    // Populate xCount and yCount dictionaries
    for (let [x, y] of points) {
        if (x !== 0 && y !== 0) {
            xCount[x] = (xCount[x] || 0) + 1;
            yCount[y] = (yCount[y] || 0) + 1;
        }
    }

    // Count right-angled triangles
    let count = 0;
    for (let [x, y] of points) {
        if (x !== 0 && y !== 0) {
            count += (xCount[x] - 1) * (yCount[y] - 1);
        }
    }

    return count;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(countRightTriangles([[1, 0], [0, 1], [1, 1], [2, 0], [0, 2], [2, 2]])); // Output: 8
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Building dictionaries:** `O(n)`
2. **Calculating triangles:** `O(n)`

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of points provided. This should be efficient for reasonably large inputs.
