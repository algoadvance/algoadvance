[Leetcode 1605. Find Valid Matrix Given Row and Column Sums](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1605)
## Problem Statement

You are given two arrays, `rowSum` and `colSum`, of the same length. The task is to find any matrix `mat` of non-negative integers such that:

1. The sum of the elements in the `i-th` row is equal to `rowSum[i]`.
2. The sum of the elements in the `j-th` column is equal to `colSum[j]`.

You need to return any matrix that satisfies these properties. If there are multiple solutions, you can return any of them.

### Example
**Input:**
```
rowSum = [3, 8]
colSum = [4, 7]
```

**Output:**
```
[[3, 0],
 [1, 7]]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the elements in the `rowSum` or `colSum` be zero?**
   - Yes, they can be zero.

2. **Is there a guaranteed solution for each valid input?**
   - Yes, the problem guarantees a solution exists for the given inputs.

3. **Are there any constraints on the length of `rowSum` and `colSum`?**
   - The lengths of `rowSum` and `colSum` are the same, as both represent dimensions of the matrix.

## Strategy

A greedy approach can be used to construct the matrix:

1. Initialize a zero matrix of the appropriate size based on the lengths of `rowSum` and `colSum`.
2. Traverse through each cell `(i, j)` of the matrix, and fill in the value by taking the minimum of `rowSum[i]` and `colSum[j]`.
3. Subtract the chosen value from both `rowSum[i]` and `colSum[j]`.
4. Continue this process until all rows and columns sums are satisfied.

## Code

```javascript
function restoreMatrix(rowSum, colSum) {
    const rows = rowSum.length;
    const cols = colSum.length;
    const matrix = Array.from({ length: rows }, () => Array(cols).fill(0));
    
    let i = 0, j = 0;
    
    while (i < rows && j < cols) {
        // Assign the value at matrix[i][j] as the minimum of rowSum[i] and colSum[j]
        const value = Math.min(rowSum[i], colSum[j]);
        matrix[i][j] = value;
        
        // Subtract the value from both rowSum[i] and colSum[j]
        rowSum[i] -= value;
        colSum[j] -= value;
        
        // Move to the next row or column (whichever sum is zero)
        if (rowSum[i] === 0) {
            i++;
        }
        if (colSum[j] === 0) {
            j++;
        }
    }
    
    return matrix;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \(O(m + n)\), where \(m\) is the number of rows and \(n\) is the number of columns. This is because we are iterating through each element of the row and column sums once to fill in the matrix.

This solution efficiently constructs the required matrix while maintaining the constraints given by `rowSum` and `colSum`.
