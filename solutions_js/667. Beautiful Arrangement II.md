[Leetcode 667. Beautiful Arrangement II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l667)
## Problem Statement
Given two integers n and k, you need to construct a list which contains numbers from 1 to n and ensures that exactly `k` different integers appear as the absolute difference between consecutive integers in the list. If there are multiple answers, return any of them.

### Example:
1. Input: n = 3, k = 1
   Output: [1, 2, 3]
   
2. Input: n = 3, k = 2
   Output: [1, 3, 2]

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `n` or `k` be zero?**
   No. As per the problem, `n` and `k` are both positive integers, and `1 <= k < n <= 10^4`.

2. **Are consecutive differences treated as distinct if they have different signs?**
   No, we're considering absolute differences only.

3. **When n = k, should the output list comprise of alternating high and low values?**
   Yes, when `n = k`, the output should ideally switch between high and low to maximize the absolute differences.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we'll leverage the pattern of interleaving high and low values for the required number of k differences. Here's how we'll approach it:

1. **Construct the Differences from 1 to k:**
   - Create an initial pattern by alternating between the smallest and largest remaining numbers. This will ensure that the differences between the consecutive integers cover all values from 1 to k uniquely.

2. **Fill the Remaining Values:**
   - After establishing the first `k + 1` numbers with the required differences, the remaining numbers will be filled sequentially.

### Pattern Generation
For the first `k + 1` numbers:
- Start with `1` and alternate between `n` and `2`, then `n-1`, `3`, etc., to ensure distinct differences.

Example for `n = 7, k = 4`:
- Start with: 1, 7, 2, 6, 3
- Fill remaining: 4, 5, (the rest will be in sequential order as differences have been covered.

## Code
```javascript
function constructArray(n, k) {
    let result = [];
    let left = 1;
    let right = n;
    
    // Create the first part with k unique differences
    for (let i = 0; i < k + 1; i++) {
        if (i % 2 === 0) {
            result.push(left++);
        } else {
            result.push(right--);
        }
    }
    
    // Fill the remaining part in sequential order
    if ((k + 1) % 2 !== 0) {
        for (let i = left; i <= right; i++) {
            result.push(i);
        }
    } else {
        for (let i = right; i >= left; i--) {
            result.push(i);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(constructArray(3, 1)); // Output: [1, 2, 3]
console.log(constructArray(3, 2)); // Output: [1, 3, 2]
console.log(constructArray(7, 4)); // Output: [1, 7, 2, 6, 3, 4, 5]
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)` because we populate the result array with `n` elements in a single pass.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is `O(n)` as we are storing the result in an array of size `n`.

This solution efficiently constructs a list that meets the specified conditions using a direct approach.
