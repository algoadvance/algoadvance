[Leetcode 3229. Minimum Operations to Make Array Equal to Target](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3229)
### Problem Statement
You are given two integer arrays `arr1` and `arr2` of the same length. In one operation, you can increase or decrease any element of `arr1` by `1`. Return the minimum number of operations required to make `arr1` equal to `arr2`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints**:
   - What are the lengths of the arrays?
   - Can the arrays contain negative numbers?
   - Is the size of the arrays fixed or can it vary?
   
   Let's assume there are no strict constraints on the values of the integers, but both arrays will always be of the same length.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - What happens if both arrays are already equal?
   - What if one or both arrays are empty?

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:
1. Initialize a counter `operations` to zero.
2. Loop through both arrays simultaneously.
3. For each element, calculate the absolute difference between the corresponding elements of `arr1` and `arr2`.
4. Accumulate these differences in the `operations` counter.
5. Return the value of `operations`.

The number of operations needed to make an element in `arr1` equal to the corresponding element in `arr2` is simply the absolute difference between those two values.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the arrays. This is because we are iterating through both arrays exactly once.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr1
 * @param {number[]} arr2
 * @return {number}
 */
function minOperations(arr1, arr2) {
    let operations = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < arr1.length; i++) {
        operations += Math.abs(arr1[i] - arr2[i]);
    }

    return operations;
}

// Example Usage:
let arr1 = [1, 2, 3];
let arr2 = [2, 3, 4];
console.log(minOperations(arr1, arr2));  // Output: 3
```

### Explanation of Code
1. **Loop Initialization**: Start with a variable `operations` set to 0.
2. **Main Loop**:
   - Iterate through each pair of elements in `arr1` and `arr2`.
   - Compute the absolute difference between the elements and add it to `operations`.
3. **Return Result**: Finally, return the accumulated value of `operations`.

This solution efficiently calculates the minimum operations required to make `arr1` equal to `arr2` in linear time.
