[Leetcode 1510. Stone Game IV](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1510)
## Problem Statement

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

Initially, there are `n` stones in a pile. On each player's turn, that player makes a move consisting of removing any non-zero square number of stones from the pile.

Also, if a player cannot make a move, he/she loses the game.

Given a positive integer `n`, return `True` if and only if Alice wins the game assuming both players play optimally.

**Example:** 

- Example 1:
    - Input: n = 1
    - Output: true
    - Explanation: Alice can remove 1 stone to win the game.
- Example 2:
    - Input: n = 2
    - Output: false
    - Explanation: Alice cannot make any move and loses the game.
- Example 3:
    - Input: n = 4
    - Output: true
    - Explanation: Alice can remove 1 stone and Bob cannot make a move to win the game.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: What is the range of the integer `n`? 
   - **A**: The problem doesn't specify a range, but typically for such problems, `n` ranges from 1 to \(10^4\) or \(10^5\).

2. **Q**: Is there any upper limit on the number of stones that can be removed in one turn?
   - **A**: Yes, you can only remove a non-zero perfect square number of stones, such as 1, 4, 9, 16, etc.

3. **Q**: Do Alice and Bob always play optimally?
   - **A**: Yes, the problem statement mentions that both players play optimally.

## Strategy

The problem can be approached using dynamic programming. 

1. **Define a DP Array:** Let's define a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents whether Alice can win with `i` stones given both play optimally.
   
2. **Base Cases:**
    - `dp[0] = False`: With 0 stones, Alice cannot make a move and loses.

3. **Transition/Recursive Relation:**
    - For each `i` (from 1 to `n`), Alice can remove any perfect square number `j^2` (where `j^2` <= `i`). If there exists any `j^2` such that `dp[i - j^2]` is `False` (i.e., leaving Bob in a losing position), then `dp[i]` should be `True`.

4. **Final Answer:**
    - The answer will be `dp[n]`.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var winnerSquareGame = function(n) {
    const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(false);

    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j * j <= i; j++) {
            if (!dp[i - j * j]) {
                dp[i] = true;
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[n];
};

// Test cases
console.log(winnerSquareGame(1)); // Output: true
console.log(winnerSquareGame(2)); // Output: false
console.log(winnerSquareGame(4)); // Output: true
console.log(winnerSquareGame(7)); // Output: false
console.log(winnerSquareGame(17)); // Output: false
console.log(winnerSquareGame(18)); // Output: true
```

## Time Complexity

- **Filling the DP Array**: We iterate over `n` elements. For each element `i`, we iterate over all perfect squares less than or equal to `i`. The number of perfect squares <= `i` is `sqrt(i)`. Therefore, the time complexity is:

  \[
  \sum_{i=1}^{n} \sqrt{i} \approx \int_{1}^{n} \sqrt{x} \, dx = \frac{2}{3} \cdot n^{3/2}
  \]

  Hence, the overall time complexity will be `O(n^(3/2))`.

- **Space Complexity**: We use an array of size `n + 1` to store the DP values. Therefore, the space complexity is `O(n)`.
