[Leetcode 1652. Defuse the Bomb](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1652)
### Problem Statement
Given a circular array `code` of length `n` and an integer `k`, return a new array `ans` of length `n` where `ans[i]` is the sum of the next `k` elements (if `k > 0`), previous `k` elements (if `k < 0`), or the same element if `k == 0` from the `code` array. Since the array is circular, elements beyond the last element wrap around to the beginning of the array.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints**:
   - What is the range of the length of the array `n`?
   - What is the range of integer `k`?

   Typical constraints for these problems are between 1 to 100 for `n` and similar small ranges for `k`, but please provide specifics if available.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - How should the problem handle zeros? Array elements or `k` being zero?
   - What if the array contains negative numbers?

3. **Output**:
   - Should the new array `ans` maintain the circular property, or should it be a regular array with linear indexing?

Based on the general problem assumption, let's proceed.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Initialize the `ans` array with zeros of the same length as `code`.

2. **Calculate for each index**:
   - For each index `i`, calculate the sum of the next `k` elements if `k > 0`.
   - Calculate the sum of the previous `k` elements if `k < 0`.
   - If `k == 0`, the element in `ans` should be `0`.

3. **Circular Indexing**:
   - Use modulo operation to ensure circular indexing.

### Code

Here is the JavaScript implementation:

```javascript
const defuseTheBomb = (code, k) => {
    const n = code.length;
    const ans = new Array(n).fill(0);

    if (k === 0) {
        return ans;  // All elements are zero as required.
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let sum = 0;
        if (k > 0) {
            for (let j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
                sum += code[(i + j) % n];
            }
        } else { // k < 0
            for (let j = 1; j <= Math.abs(k); j++) {
                sum += code[(i - j + n) % n];
            }
        }
        ans[i] = sum;
    }

    return ans;
};

// Example Usage:
let code = [5, 7, 1, 4];
let k = 3;
console.log(defuseTheBomb(code, k)); // Expected output: [12, 10, 16, 13]

code = [1, 2, 3, 4];
k = 0;
console.log(defuseTheBomb(code, k)); // Expected output: [0, 0, 0, 0]

code = [2, 4, 9, 3];
k = -2;
console.log(defuseTheBomb(code, k)); // Expected output: [12, 5, 6, 13]
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is \(O(n \times |k|)\) where \(n\) is the length of the array and \(|k|\) is the absolute value of `k` because for each of the `n` elements, you sum `|k|` elements. This can be optimized further using prefix sums if required for larger datasets.
