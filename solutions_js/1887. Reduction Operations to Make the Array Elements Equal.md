[Leetcode 1887. Reduction Operations to Make the Array Elements Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1887)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` which you can assume is not empty. In one operation, you can reduce any element of the array to any of its preceding elements. You need to make all the elements in the array equal. Find the minimum number of operations required to do this.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Can the array already have elements that are equal?
   **A:** Yes, and in that case, fewer operations will be needed.
2. **Q:** What is the maximum possible size of the array?
   **A:** The size constraint should be within the typical limitations of LeetCode constraints, i.e., numbers can typically go up to `10^5`.
3. **Q:** What is the range of the numbers in the array?
   **A:** The range can also be assumed to be within typical constraints, usually within the bounds of integer values.

### Code

Let's proceed to write the code for this problem:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var reductionOperations = function(nums) {
    // Step 1: Sort the nums array
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    let operations = 0;
    let count = 0;
    
    // Step 2: Iterate the sorted array from the second last element to the first
    for (let i = nums.length - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        // If the current element is different from the next one
        if (nums[i] != nums[i + 1]) {
            count++; // Increment count for distinct elements encounter
        }
        // Add count to the operations
        operations += count;
    }
    
    return operations;
};
```

### Strategy
1. **Sorting the Array:** First, sort the array, so all the operations to reduce elements can be done from right to left.
2. **Counting Operations:** Iterate from the second last element to the first element of the sorted array.
    - If the element is different from the next one, increment a `count` to keep a track of distinct elements encountered.
    - Add this `count` to the total `operations`, which accumulates how many operations have been done.

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting:** The sorting step will take \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Iteration:** The iteration through the sorted array will take \(O(n)\).
Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\), which is efficient for the given problem constraints. 

By following the described approach, the problem can be efficiently solved while ensuring a clear understanding of the required logic to minimize the number of operations.
