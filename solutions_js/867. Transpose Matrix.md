[Leetcode 867. Transpose Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l867)
### Problem Statement
Given a 2D integer array `matrix`, return the transpose of `matrix`.

The transpose of a matrix is the matrix flipped over its main diagonal, switching the matrix's row and column indices.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]]
Output: [[1,4,7],[2,5,8],[3,6,9]]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: matrix = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6]]
Output: [[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What are the dimensions of the matrix?
   **A:** The matrix dimensions can vary but will always have at least one row and one column.

2. **Q:** Can the input matrix have non-integer elements?
   **A:** Based on the problem statement, the matrix will only contain integers.

3. **Q:** Should the solution handle empty matrices?
   **A:** While not explicitly mentioned, if an empty matrix is provided, it should return an empty matrix as well.

### Strategy
1. Create a new matrix to hold the transpose. The new matrix should have dimensions that are the reverse of the original matrix.
2. Iterate through the original matrix and assign the transposed values to the new matrix.
3. Return the new matrix.

### Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} matrix
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
var transpose = function(matrix) {
    let rows = matrix.length;
    let cols = matrix[0].length;
    let transposedMatrix = Array.from({ length: cols }, () => Array(rows).fill(0));
    
    for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
        for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
            transposedMatrix[c][r] = matrix[r][c];
        }
    }
    
    return transposedMatrix;
};

// Example usage:
let matrix1 = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6], [7,8,9]];
console.log(transpose(matrix1)); // Output: [[1,4,7], [2,5,8], [3,6,9]]

let matrix2 = [[1,2,3], [4,5,6]];
console.log(transpose(matrix2)); // Output: [[1,4],[2,5],[3,6]]
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is **O(m * n)** where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the original matrix. This is because we need to iterate through each element of the matrix exactly once to place it in the correct position in the transposed matrix.

The space complexity is also **O(m * n)** due to the additional storage needed for the transposed matrix.
