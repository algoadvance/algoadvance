[Leetcode 1551. Minimum Operations to Make Array Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1551)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n`. An array `arr` of length `n` is defined as follows:
- `arr[i] = 2 * i + 1` for `i` in the interval `[0, n-1]`.

In one operation, you can choose two indices `x` and `y` where `x != y` and decrease `arr[x]` by 1 and increase `arr[y]` by 1. Your goal is to make all the elements of the array equal. Return the minimum number of operations needed to make all elements of the array equal.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be the value of each element in the final array?**
   - The elements should all be the same, and for the minimum number of operations, they should all be the median value of the original array.
2. **Is there a specific range for `n`?**
   - No specific range is mentioned, but we can assume it to be any positive integer.

### Strategy

1. **Determine the Target Value:**
   - Given `arr[i] = 2 * i + 1`, which forms an arithmetic sequence: 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., it is evident that the median value minimizes the number of moves. For an odd `n`, the median value is `n` itself. For an even `n`, either `n` or `n-1` can be chosen because of symmetry.

2. **Calculate the Number of Operations:**
   - For simplicity, consider the case when `n` is odd (as the median calculation directly applies). For even `n`, a similar minimal calculation can be applied symmetrically.
   - Define `target = n`. The number of operations to convert each element to the target can be accumulated symmetrically from the median.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var minOperations = function(n) {
    let operations = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < Math.floor(n / 2); i++) {
        operations += (n - (2 * i + 1));
    }
    return operations;
};

// Example
console.log(minOperations(3)); // Output: 2
console.log(minOperations(6)); // Output: 9
```

### Explanation

1. **Loop Through Half the Array:**
   - The loop runs from `0` to `Math.floor(n / 2) - 1`, adding `(n - arr[i])` for each `i`. Here, `arr[i] = 2 * i + 1`, thus simplified to `n - (2 * i + 1)`.

2. **Sum of Differences:**
   - By summing up the differences from each element to the median, the total number of operations required is found.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n/2)**, which simplifies to **O(n)**, as we are iterating through half of the array linearly. 

This is efficient and handles the given constraints effectively.
