[Leetcode 606. Construct String from Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l606)
### Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, construct a string consisting of parenthesis and integers from a binary tree with the preorder traversal way, and return it.

Omit all the empty parenthesis pairs that don't affect the one-to-one mapping relationship between the string and the original binary tree.

#### Example:
```
Input: Binary tree: [1,2,3,4]
          1
        /   \
       2     3
      / 
     4

Output: "1(2(4))(3)"
Explanation: 
Originallay it needs to be "1(2(4)())(3()())", 
but you need to omit all the unnecessary empty parenthesis pairs. 
And it will be "1(2(4))(3)"
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the input always a valid binary tree?**
   - Yes.
2. **Can the tree have negative values?**
   - Yes.
3. **Do we need to handle only tree structures with integer values?**
   - Yes.
4. **Can the tree be empty?**
   - Yes, in that case, the output should be an empty string.

### Strategy
1. **Pre-order Traversal**:
   - Visit the root node.
   - Visit the left subtree.
   - Visit the right subtree.

2. **String Management**:
   - For each node, append the node's value.
   - If there is a left subtree, recursively generate the string for it and surround it with parentheses.
   - If there is no left subtree but there is a right subtree, add `()`.
   - If there is a right subtree, recursively generate the string for it and surround it with parentheses.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the tree is empty, return an empty string.

### Code

```javascript
// Definition for a binary tree node.
function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
    this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
    this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
    this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
}

function tree2str(t) {
    if (t == null) {
        return '';
    }
    
    // Pre-order traversal
    let result = '' + t.val;
    
    if (t.left || t.right) {
        // Process left subtree
        result += '(' + tree2str(t.left) + ')';
    }
    
    if (t.right) {
        // Process right subtree
        result += '(' + tree2str(t.right) + ')';
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), in the worst case for the recursion stack when the tree is skewed.

With this approach, we ensure that we construct the string correctly while avoiding unnecessary parentheses as described in the problem statement.
