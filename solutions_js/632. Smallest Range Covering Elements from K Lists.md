[Leetcode 632. Smallest Range Covering Elements from K Lists](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l632)
### Problem Statement

You have `k` lists of sorted integers `nums`. Find the smallest range `[start, end]` that includes at least one number from each of the `k` lists.

Example:
```
Input: nums = [[4,10,15,24,26], [0,9,12,20], [5,18,22,30]]
Output: [20,24]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the lists always non-empty?**
   - Yes, all lists are non-empty and contain at least one integer.

2. **Can the integers in the lists have negative values?**
   - Yes, integers can be negative.

3. **What should be returned if there are multiple smallest ranges?**
   - Return any one of the smallest ranges.

4. **How large can `k` be?**
   - Assume `k` is reasonably small such that an efficient algorithm can be designed within time constraints.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a min-heap to keep track of the smallest unprocessed element in each list.
   - Keep an array of pointers to track the current position in each list.
   - Maintain variables to store the result of the smallest range `[start, end]`.

2. **Heap Strategy**:
   - Initialize pointers to the first element of each list and build the initial heap.
   - Track the maximum value among the current elements in the heap.

3. **Expand and Contract**:
   - Extract the minimum element from the heap (this is the start of your current range).
   - Calculate the range with the current maximum tracked value.
   - If this range is smaller than the previously recorded range, update the result.
   - Move the pointer in the list from which the minimum element was extracted and push the new element onto the heap.
   - Stop if any list is exhausted.

### Code

```javascript
var smallestRange = function(nums) {
    const pq = new MinPriorityQueue({ priority: x => x.value });
    const k = nums.length;
    let maxValue = -Infinity;
    let rangeStart = 0, rangeEnd = Infinity;

    // Initialize the min-heap with the first element of each list
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        pq.enqueue({ value: nums[i][0], listIdx: i, idx: 0 });
        maxValue = Math.max(maxValue, nums[i][0]);
    }

    while (pq.size() === k) {
        // Get the minimum element from the heap
        const minElement = pq.dequeue().element;

        // Update the smallest range if needed
        if (maxValue - minElement.value < rangeEnd - rangeStart) {
            rangeStart = minElement.value;
            rangeEnd = maxValue;
        }

        const listIdx = minElement.listIdx;
        const idx = minElement.idx;

        // Move to the next element in the current list
        if (idx + 1 < nums[listIdx].length) {
            const nextValue = nums[listIdx][idx + 1];
            pq.enqueue({ value: nextValue, listIdx: listIdx, idx: idx + 1 });
            maxValue = Math.max(maxValue, nextValue);
        }
    }

    return [rangeStart, rangeEnd];
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: Building the initial heap takes `O(k log k)`.
- **Processing**: For each element, we push and pop from the heap at most `n` times, where `n` is the total number of elements. Each push and pop operation takes `O(log k)` time.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log k)`, where `n` is the total number of elements across all lists and `k` is the number of lists.
