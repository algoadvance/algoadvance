[Leetcode 1944. Number of Visible People in a Queue](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1944)
### Problem Statement

In a queue of people, every person has a number representing their height. Compute the number of people a person at index `i` in the queue can see to their right. A person `i` can see another person `j` to their right if:
1. `i < j`,
2. every person between `i` and `j` has a height smaller than person `i`'s height,
3. and person `j` has a height greater than or equal to person `i`'s height.

Return an array `answer`, where `answer[i]` is the number of people the `i`-th person can see to their right.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the queue of heights always non-empty?**
   - Yes, the queue has at least one person.
   
2. **Can two people have the same height?**
   - Yes, multiple people can have the same height.

3. **What should be returned if nobody can see anyone?**
   - If a person cannot see anyone to their right, the answer for that person should be `0`.

### Strategy

To solve this, we can use a monotonic stack which helps efficiently find the next greater element to the right for each person. The algorithm operates as follows:

1. Traverse the heights array from right to left.
2. Use a stack to keep track of indices of the people in the queue.
3. For each person at index `i`, pop elements from the stack until the top of the stack has a height greater than or equal to the current personâ€™s height. The count of popped elements will be the number of people the current person can see.
4. Push the current person's index onto the stack.
5. Record the count of visible people for the current person in the result array.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} heights
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var canSeePersonsCount = function(heights) {
    const n = heights.length;
    const result = new Array(n).fill(0);
    const stack = [];

    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        let count = 0;

        while (stack.length > 0 && heights[i] > heights[stack[stack.length - 1]]) {
            stack.pop();
            count++;
        }

        if (stack.length > 0) count++;

        result[i] = count;
        stack.push(i);
    }

    return result;
};

// Example usage
console.log(canSeePersonsCount([10, 6, 8, 5, 11, 9])); // Output: [3, 1, 2, 1, 1, 0]
console.log(canSeePersonsCount([5, 1, 2, 3, 10])); // Output: [4, 1, 1, 1, 0]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
  - Each index is pushed and popped from the stack at most once, leading to a linear time complexity relative to the input size.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\)
  - The stack and result array both use linear space.

This approach ensures we handle the problem efficiently, even for large input sizes.
