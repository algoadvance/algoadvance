[Leetcode 2848. Points That Intersect With Cars](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2848)
## Problem Statement
You are given a 2D integer array `cars` where `cars[i] = [start_i, end_i]` represents the start and end points of the i-th car on an axis. Returns the number of integer points on the axis that are covered by one or more cars.

Here, a point is considered covered by a car if it lies between the start and end points of the car, including the endpoints.

**Example:**
```javascript
Input: cars = [[1, 3], [2, 5], [7, 10]]
Output: 8
Explanation: The points covered by the cars are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are the points inclusive in the range of the car?
   - Yes, points are inclusive between `start_i` and `end_i`.
2. Can ranges overlap?
   - Yes, multiple `cars` ranges can overlap.
3. Will the numbers always be positive?
   - No specific constraint regarding positive numbers, but typically we can assume they are non-negative integers as they represent points on the axis.
4. Will `cars` contain at least one car?
   - Yes, `cars` will have at least one car.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we'll use a set to keep track of all unique integer points that are covered by any car. Steps are as follows:
1. Initialize an empty set to track covered points.
2. Iterate over each car's range given by `cars`.
3. For each car, add all integer points between the start and end of the range to the set.
4. The size of the set at the end will be the number of unique integer points covered.

This method ensures we capture all points, including overlaps without double counting them.

## Code
```javascript
function countIntersectingPoints(cars) {
    const coveredPoints = new Set();
    
    for (const [start, end] of cars) {
        for (let point = start; point <= end; point++) {
            coveredPoints.add(point);
        }
    }
    
    return coveredPoints.size;
}

// Example usage:
const cars = [[1, 3], [2, 5], [7, 10]];
console.log(countIntersectingPoints(cars)); // Output: 8
```

## Time Complexity
- **Iterating over each car**: O(n), where `n` is the number of cars.
- **Adding points to the set**: For each car, in the worst case, we add `end_i - start_i + 1` points. 
  Hence, if `L` is the average length of intervals: O(n * L).

Overall time complexity: O(n * L), where `n` is the number of cars and `L` is the average length of the car ranges. This should be efficient for most reasonable constraints.
