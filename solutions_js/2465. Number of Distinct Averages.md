[Leetcode 2465. Number of Distinct Averages](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2465)
### Problem Statement

Given a list of integers `nums`, you need to determine the number of distinct "averages" that can be formed. An "average" is defined as the arithmetic mean of a non-empty subsequence of the list. The result should be the count of distinct average values.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the integers in the list guaranteed to be positive, negative, or can they be both?**
   - Both positive and negative integers can be present.
   
2. **Is the list guaranteed to have at least one element?**
   - Yes, the list contains at least one element.
   
3. **Do the averages need to be integers or can they be floating-point numbers?**
   - Averages can be floating-point numbers, and we need to count distinct values.

4. **Are there any constraints on the size of the `nums` list?**
   - Typically, LeetCode problems tend to have constraints like `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5` and `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`.

### Strategy

To find the number of distinct averages, we can employ the following strategy:

1. **Sorting:** First, sort the `nums` list.
2. **Two-pointer technique:** Use two pointers to explore pairs. One pointer starts from the beginning (`i`), and the other starts from the end (`j`) of the sorted list. 
3. **Calculate averages:** For each pair, calculate the average and store it in a set to ensure uniqueness.
4. **Shift pointers:** Move the start pointer right and the end pointer left, continuing this until the two pointers meet or cross each other.

### Code

Here's the code implementing our strategy:

```javascript
function distinctAverages(nums) {
    if (nums.length === 0) return 0;

    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let distinctAveragesSet = new Set();
    let i = 0;
    let j = nums.length - 1;

    while (i <= j) {
        let average = (nums[i] + nums[j]) / 2;
        distinctAveragesSet.add(average);
        i++;
        j--;
    }

    return distinctAveragesSet.size;
}

// Example usage:
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(distinctAverages(nums));  // Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting:** Sorting `nums` takes `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`.
2. **Two-pointer traversal:** This involves a single traversal of the list with two pointers, which is `O(n)`.

Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)` due to the sorting step being the most time-consuming operation. The space complexity is `O(n)` in the worst case due to the storage of averages in the set.
