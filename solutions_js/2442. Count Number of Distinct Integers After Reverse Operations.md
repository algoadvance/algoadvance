[Leetcode 2442. Count Number of Distinct Integers After Reverse Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2442)
### Problem Statement
Let's take an array of positive integers and perform the following operations:

1. Reverse the digits of every integer in the array.
2. Count the total number of distinct integers in the array after including both the original and reversed integers.

You are given an array `nums` representing the array of positive integers. Your task is to determine the number of distinct integers in the array after performing the above operations.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of the values in the input array `nums`?
   - What is the maximum length of the array?

2. **Output:**
   - Are we only interested in counting distinct integers, or do we need to return the distinct integers themselves?

3. **Specific Cases:**
   - How should we handle integers that are the same after reversing (e.g., 101)?
   - Should the reverse operations consider leading zeroes (e.g., how should `120` be treated after reversing `021`)?

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var countDistinctIntegers = function(nums) {
    const set = new Set();

    for (let num of nums) {
        set.add(num);
        const reversedNum = parseInt(num.toString().split('').reverse().join(''));
        set.add(reversedNum);
    }

    return set.size;
};

// Example usage:
let nums = [123, 321, 98];
console.log(countDistinctIntegers(nums));  // Output should be 4
```

### Strategy
1. **Data Structures:**
   - Use a `Set` to keep track of the distinct integers because sets automatically handle duplicate elements.
   
2. **Steps:**
   - Iterate through each element of the input array `nums`.
   - For each element:
     - Add the original integer to the set.
     - Reverse the integer by converting it to a string, reversing the string, and parsing it back to an integer.
     - Add the reversed integer to the set.
   - Finally, return the size of the set, which represents the number of distinct integers.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - An integer that is symmetric will be treated the same way as any other integer.
   - Leading zeroes are automatically handled by converting the reversed string back to an integer.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n * k)`, where `n` is the number of integers in the array and `k` is the average length of the integer when converted to a string. This is because for each integer:
  - Converting the integer to a string takes `O(k)`.
  - Reversing the string takes `O(k)`.
  - Parsing the reversed string back to an integer takes `O(k)`.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for the set that stores at most `2n` elements in the worst case (one original and one reversed for each element).

By following this strategy, we efficiently calculate the number of distinct integers including the original and their reverse counterparts.
