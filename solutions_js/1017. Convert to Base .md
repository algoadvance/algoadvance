[Leetcode 1017. Convert to Base ](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1017)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, return a binary string representing its representation in base `-2`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on `n`?**
   - `n` is a non-negative integer, from 0 to 10^9.

2. **What should be the output format?**
   - The output should be a binary string representing the number in base `-2`.

3. **Are there any specific rules for constructing the binary string?**
   - Yes, the most significant bit should not be prefixed with zeros. The output should be the shortest binary representation of the integer in base `-2`.

## Strategy

The key difference between base `-2` and regular bases is the alternating sign of each positional value. In a base `-2` system:
- The 1st position (rightmost) represents `(-2)^0 = 1`
- The 2nd position represents `(-2)^1 = -2`
- The 3rd position represents `(-2)^2 = 4`
- The 4th position represents `(-2)^3 = -8`
- and so on...

For converting an integer `n` to base `-2`, the algorithm will work similarly to conversion to any base, but with the following additional steps for handling the alternating signs:

### Steps:
1. Initialize an empty string `result`.
2. While `n` is not zero:
   - Compute the remainder `r` when `n` is divided by `-2`.
   - Adjust the remainder if it is negative.
   - Append the adjusted remainder to the `result` string. 
   - Update `n` to the quotient of the division, adjusting for cases where the remainder was negative.
3. Return the reversed string of `result`.

## Time Complexity:

- The time complexity of this approach is O(log(|n|)/log(2)) since we are dividing `n` by `-2` iteratively until it becomes zero.

## Code

Here's the JavaScript code to perform the conversion:

```javascript
function baseNeg2(n) {
    if (n === 0) return "0";
    let result = "";
    
    while (n !== 0) {
        let remainder = n % -2;
        n = Math.floor(n / -2);
        
        // Handle the case of negative remainder
        if (remainder < 0) {
            remainder += 2;
            n += 1;
        }
        
        result = remainder.toString() + result;
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Example usages:
console.log(baseNeg2(2)); // "110"
console.log(baseNeg2(3)); // "111"
console.log(baseNeg2(4)); // "100"
console.log(baseNeg2(0)); // "0"
```

This code continuously divides the number by `-2` and adjusts the result to ensure the binary representation reflects those divisions accurately. It makes use of string concatenation to build the result and reverses the order by creating the string from last digit computed to the first.
