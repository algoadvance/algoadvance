[Leetcode 1838. Frequency of the Most Frequent Element](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1838)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. In one operation, you can choose an index of `nums` and increment the element at that index by 1.

Return the maximum possible frequency of an element after performing at most `k` operations.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: nums = [1,2,4], k = 5
Output: 3
Explanation: Increment the first element three times and the second element two times to make nums = [4,4,4]. The frequency of 4 is 3.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: nums = [1,4,8,13], k = 5
Output: 2
Explanation: There is no way to increment to get more than two 8s.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: nums = [3,9,6], k = 2
Output: 1
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the integers in `nums` be negative?
   - The prompt doesn't specify, so let's assume `nums` can contain any integers.

2. Is `k` always a non-negative integer?
   - Yes, typically constraints state that `k` is a non-negative integer.

3. Is the array sorted? 
   - No, you'll need to handle unsorted arrays.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Array**: Sorting helps because if we want to make multiple elements equal to a higher value within the smallest number of operations, it makes sense to sort and then consider each element as a target.

2. **Sliding Window Approach**: Use a sliding window to calculate the minimum number of increments required to make all elements in the current window equal to the maximum element of the window. 

   - For each window, track the total number of increments required.
   - Expand the window by moving the right pointer.
   - Contract the window by moving the left pointer if the number of increments exceeds `k`.

3. **Adjust Window Size Based on `k`**: Adjust the window size dynamically based on the number of allowed operations `k`.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxFrequency = function(nums, k) {
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let left = 0, maxFreq = 0, totalIncrements = 0;

    for (let right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
        // Calculate the total increments needed to make nums[left:right+1] all equal to nums[right]
        totalIncrements += nums[right];
       
        // Check if we are exceeding k operations
        while (nums[right] * (right - left + 1) > totalIncrements + k) {
            totalIncrements -= nums[left];
            left++;
        }

        // Calculate the frequency in the current window
        maxFreq = Math.max(maxFreq, right - left + 1);
    }

    return maxFreq;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(maxFrequency([1,2,4], 5)); // Output: 3
console.log(maxFrequency([1,4,8,13], 5)); // Output: 2
console.log(maxFrequency([3,9,6], 2)); // Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: \( O(n \log n) \)
- **Sliding Window**: \( O(n) \)

Hence, the overall time complexity is \( O(n \log n) \), where \( n \) is the number of elements in the array. The space complexity is \( O(1) \) other than the space required for the input array.
