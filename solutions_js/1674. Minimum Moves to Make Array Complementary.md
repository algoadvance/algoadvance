[Leetcode 1674. Minimum Moves to Make Array Complementary](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1674)
### Problem Statement

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of even length `n` where `nums[i] + nums[n-1-i]` is called a **complementary pair** of the array, calculate the **minimum number of moves** required to make every pair `(nums[i], nums[n-1-i])` complementary for some integer `target`.

A move can be:

- Increment or decrement `nums[i]` or `nums[n-1-i]` by 1 unit.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the exact definition of a "complementary pair" in the context of the problem?**
   - A complementary pair means that for every pair `(nums[i], nums[n-1-i])`, `nums[i] + nums[n-1-i]` should equal the `target`.

2. **Can we assume that the input array will always have an even length?**
   - Yes, the problem specifies that `n` is even.

3. **Is there any constraint on the values within the input array?**
   - The problem does not specify such constraints, but typical constraints might be `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^5` and array length `n` such that `1 <= n <= 10^5`.

4. **Is it allowed to modify the input array or should it remain intact?**
   - You can modify the array to achieve the target but the minimum moves should be counted.

### Strategy

1. **Understand Complementary Pair Requirements**:
   - For each pair `(nums[i], nums[n-1-i])`, determine the current sum and how far it is from the target.

2. **Calculate Minimum Moves**:
   - To make `nums[i] + nums[n-1-i]` equal to the target, determine the absolute difference between the current sum of the pair and the target. This difference is the number of moves required.
   
3. **Optimization:**
   - Instead of iterating over all pairs and adjusting each individual number, utilize bucket-sorting like techniques to keep track of how many moves are required to achieve the target. Essentially, calculate all possible sums and maintain counts to infer the minimum number of moves.

### Code

```javascript
var minMoves = function(nums, limit) {
    let n = nums.length;
    let change = Array(2 * limit + 2).fill(0);
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
        let a = nums[i], b = nums[n - 1 - i];
        
        change[2] += 2;
        change[Math.min(a, b) + 1] -= 1;
        change[a + b] -= 1;
        change[a + b + 1] += 1;
        change[Math.max(a, b) + limit + 1] += 1;
    }
    
    let res = 2 * n, curr = 0;
    for (let i = 2; i <= 2 * limit; i++) {
        curr += change[i];
        res = Math.min(res, curr);
    }
    
    return res;
};

```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n + limit)`, where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. This includes:
  - **O(n)** for iterating through pairs in the array.
  - **O(limit)** for processing the auxiliary array to calculate the minimum moves required.
  
- **Space Complexity**: `O(limit)`, for the auxiliary `change` array to keep track of changes.
