[Leetcode 685. Redundant Connection II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l685)
## Problem Statement

In this problem, a rooted tree is a directed graph such that, there is exactly one node (`root`) for which all other nodes are descendants of this node, plus every node has exactly one parent except the root node which has no parent.

The given input is a directed graph that started as a rooted tree with `N` nodes (with distinct values from `1` to `N`), with one additional directed edge added. The added edge has two different or the same vertices represented by a 2D-array edges (where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` represents a directed edge from node `ui` to node `vi`).

Find the edge that, if removed, will result in the graph becoming a rooted tree of `N` nodes. If there are multiple answers, return the answer that occurs last in the given 2D-array.

### Example:

```plaintext
Input: [[1,2], [1,3], [2,3]]
Output: [2,3]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can there be multiple edges between two nodes?
   **A**: No, this problem assumes simple directed edges.
   
2. **Q**: What should be returned if removing multiple edges makes the graph a rooted tree?
   **A**: Return the last edge from the 2D-array that was added last.

3. **Q**: Are the nodes guaranteed to be labeled from `1` to `N`?
   **A**: Yes.

## Strategy

There are two main cases to handle:

1. **Case 1:** A node has two parents. This can be detected during the array traversal by keeping track of parents of each node. In such a scenario, we have a candidate edge that can be removed to form a valid tree.
2. **Case 2:** There is a cycle in the graph. This can be detected using Union-Find (Disjoint Set) data structure. In this case, we need to remove an edge that when removed, will break the cycle.

We start by checking if there is any node with more than one parent:

- If such a node is found, check if removing any of these edges results in a valid tree using Union-Find.
- If no such node is found, then detect cycles using Union-Find and return the edge that causes the cycle.

## Code
```javascript
class UnionFind {
    constructor(size) {
        this.parent = Array.from({ length: size }, (_, i) => i);
        this.rank = Array(size).fill(1);
    }

    find(x) {
        if (this.parent[x] !== x) {
            this.parent[x] = this.find(this.parent[x]);
        }
        return this.parent[x];
    }

    union(x, y) {
        const rootX = this.find(x);
        const rootY = this.find(y);

        if (rootX === rootY) return false;

        if (this.rank[rootX] > this.rank[rootY]) {
            this.parent[rootY] = rootX;
        } else if (this.rank[rootX] < this.rank[rootY]) {
            this.parent[rootX] = rootY;
        } else {
            this.parent[rootY] = rootX;
            this.rank[rootX] += 1;
        }
        return true;
    }
}

var findRedundantDirectedConnection = function(edges) {
    const n = edges.length;
    const parent = Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    let candidate1 = null;
    let candidate2 = null;

    // Step 1: Check for nodes with two parents.
    for (let [u, v] of edges) {
        if (parent[v] === 0) {
            parent[v] = u;
        } else {
            candidate1 = [parent[v], v];
            candidate2 = [u, v];
            break;
        }
    }

    // Apply Union-Find
    const uf = new UnionFind(n + 1);

    for (let [u, v] of edges) {
        if ((candidate1 && candidate1[0] === u && candidate1[1] === v) || (candidate2 && candidate2[0] === u && candidate2[1] === v)) {
            continue;
        }
        
        if (!uf.union(u, v)) {
            if (candidate1) {
                return candidate1;
            }
            return [u, v];
        }
    }

    return candidate2;
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the number of edges. We iterate through the edges a constant number of times (3 times being the most).
- **Space Complexity:** O(N), primarily for the Union-Find data structures and other auxiliary space used.
