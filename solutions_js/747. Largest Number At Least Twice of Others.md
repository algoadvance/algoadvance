[Leetcode 747. Largest Number At Least Twice of Others](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l747)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` where the largest integer is at least twice as much as every other number in the array. If the largest integer is at least twice as much as every other number in the array, return the index of the largest number, or return `-1` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum and minimum number of elements in the array?
     - The array will have at least 1 element and at most 50 elements.
   - What is the range of element values?
     - Each element will be an integer in the range of [-10^6, 10^6].

2. **Output Clarifications:**
   - What should be returned if the array has only one element?
     - Return the index `0` as the only element is trivially at least twice as large as every other element (since there are no other elements).

### Strategy

1. **Initial Check:** If the array has only one element, return `0` because there are no other elements to compare.
2. **Finding Largest and Second Largest:**
   - Traverse the array once to find the largest element and its index.
   - Traverse the array again to ensure no other element is more than half the largest element.
3. **Final Decision:**
   - If the largest element is at least twice the second largest, return the index of the largest element.
   - Otherwise, return `-1`.

### Code

```javascript
var dominantIndex = function(nums) {
    if (nums.length === 1) return 0;

    let max = -Infinity;
    let secondMax = -Infinity;
    let maxIndex = -1;

    // First pass to find the maximum number and its index
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] > max) {
            secondMax = max;
            max = nums[i];
            maxIndex = i;
        } else if (nums[i] > secondMax) {
            secondMax = nums[i];
        }
    }

    // Check if the maximum number is at least twice as large as the second maximum
    if (max >= 2 * secondMax) {
        return maxIndex;
    } else {
        return -1;
    }
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **First pass:** To find the largest and second largest elements. This takes `O(n)`.
- **Second pass:** Checking that the largest element is at least twice of every other element. Combined with the first pass, the total time complexity remains `O(n)` where `n` is the number of elements in the array.

The space complexity is `O(1)` since we only use a few extra variables regardless of the input size.
