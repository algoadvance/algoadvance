[Leetcode 3194. Minimum Average of Smallest and Largest Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3194)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, find the minimum average of the smallest and largest elements from any subarray of length at least `2`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the expected input and output?**
   - **Input:** An array of integers `nums`.
   - **Output:** A float representing the minimum average of the smallest and largest elements from any subarray of length at least `2`.

2. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the array can have negative numbers.

3. **What is the length range of the input array?**
   - Typical constraints on arrays in competitive programming can go up to 10^5 elements.

4. **Do we need to account for any specific range of values within the array?**
   - No, there are no particular constraints specified for values.

5. **Should the answer be precise to any fixed decimal point?**
   - Typically, answers are expected to be precise to several decimal points as per the problem requirements. We can assume standard floating-point precision unless specified otherwise.

Given this, let us walk through the strategy.

## Strategy

1. **Initialize variables for the smallest average.**
   - Set it initially to infinity to ensure any found average will be smaller.

2. **Check all possible subarrays of at least length 2:**
   - For each subarray, calculate the minimum and maximum of the elements in that subarray.
   - Compute the average of these two values.
   - Track the minimum average found over all subarrays.

3. **Brute-force solution can be infeasible for large arrays:**
   - Since calculating all subarrays leads to O(n^3) complexity, optimize by maintaining a sliding window for subarray of dynamic size and use efficient data structures like heaps or deques.

## Code

Here is a streamlined solution using a sliding window to maintain the minimum and maximum efficiently:

```javascript
function findMinAverage(nums) {
    let minAvg = Infinity;

    for (let start = 0; start < nums.length; start++) {
        let minInSubarray = nums[start];
        let maxInSubarray = nums[start];

        for (let end = start + 1; end < nums.length; end++) {
            minInSubarray = Math.min(minInSubarray, nums[end]);
            maxInSubarray = Math.max(maxInSubarray, nums[end]);
            let avg = (minInSubarray + maxInSubarray) / 2;
            minAvg = Math.min(minAvg, avg);
        }
    }

    return minAvg;
}

// Example usage:
let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4];
console.log(findMinAverage(nums)); // Output example
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization:** O(1)
- **Outer loop:** Runs `n` times.
- **Inner loop:** For each `start` index, the inner loop runs (n-1) times in worst case.
- **Calculations inside loops:** Each operation inside the loop is O(1).

Given this, the overall time complexity is O(n^2).

This approach should be efficient enough for typical constraints in interview problems. Nonetheless, if further optimization is required (e.g., for extremely large arrays), advanced data structures like balanced BSTs or deques can provide minimizing operations from O(n*log(n)) complexity.
