[Leetcode 833. Find And Replace in String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l833)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `S` and an array of `indexes`. Each `indexes[i]` is a starting index for the substring `sources[i]` in the string `S` that should be replaced by `targets[i]`. You need to perform all the replacements in a single pass and return the modified string.

- You can only replace if the substring `sources[i]` exactly matches the substring starting from `indexes[i]` in `S`.
- All replacements should have no overlap, which means once a replacement is made, it shouldn't interfere with another replacement.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Will the `indexes`, `sources`, and `targets` arrays always have the same length?
   **A**: Yes, all arrays will have the same length.

2. **Q**: Are there any constraints on the length of `S` or the values within `sources` or `targets`?
   **A**: The constraints are usually reasonable to fit within the memory limits of typical coding challenges.

3. **Q**: If there are multiple replacements that could be performed at the same index, which one should I perform?
   **A**: This scenario wonâ€™t happen as per the problem statement since no two replacements will start at the same index.

### Strategy

1. **Collect Replacement Info**:
   - Create an array of tuples where each tuple contains `(index, source, target)`.
   - Sort this array by the `index` in descending order. Sorting in descending order ensures that earlier replacements do not affect the positions of where subsequent replacements need to occur.

2. **Perform Replacements**:
   - Iterate over sorted replacement rules.
   - For each replacement rule, check whether the substring starting from `indexes[i]` coincides with `sources[i]`.
   - If it coincides, perform the replacement.

3. **Reconstruct String**:
   - Instead of directly modifying the original string which might be cumbersome due to multiple shifts, use a list to keep track of the characters.
   - Reconstruct the final string after applying all the valid replacements.

### Code

```javascript
function findReplaceString(S, indexes, sources, targets) {
    let replacements = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < indexes.length; i++) {
        replacements.push([indexes[i], sources[i], targets[i]]);
    }

    // Sort by index in descending order
    replacements.sort((a, b) => b[0] - a[0]);

    let result = S.split(''); // Work with an array of characters
    
    // Apply replacements
    for (let [index, source, target] of replacements) {
        if (S.substring(index, index + source.length) === source) {
            result.splice(index, source.length, ...target);
        }
    }

    return result.join('');
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting replacements**: `O(n log n)` where `n` is the length of the `indexes` array.
- **Traversal and replacement**: `O(m)` where `m` is the length of the string `S`.

So, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n + m)`. 

- **Space Complexity**:
  - The space used for the result and intermediate replacement array will be `O(m + n)`. Here `m` is for the character array of `S` and `n` for the replacement tuples.
