[Leetcode 991. Broken Calculator](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l991)
## Problem Statement

You start with a number `X` that is positive. You have two possible operations:

1. Multiply `X` by 2.
2. Subtract 1 from `X`.

Given a target number `Y`, you need to determine the minimum number of operations to transform the number `X` to `Y`.

**Example 1:**
- Input: `X = 2`, `Y = 3`
- Output: `2`
- Explanation: We can:
  - Double `2` to get `4`, then subtract `1` to get `3`.
  - Or we can:
  - Subtract `1` from `2` to get `1`, then double `1` to get `2`.

**Example 2:**
- Input: `X = 5`, `Y = 8`
- Output: `2`
- Explanation: 
  - Double `5` to get `10`.
  - Subtract `1` to get `9`.

**Example 3:**
- Input: `X = 3`, `Y = 10`
- Output: `3`
- Explanation: 
  - Double `3` to `6`.
  - Double `6` to `12`.
  - Subtract `1` to get `11`.
  - Subtract `1` to get `10`.

## Clarifying Questions
To better understand the problem, let's clarify some points:

1. Is there a constraint on how large `X` and `Y` can be?
2. Is `X` always less than or equal to `Y`? If not, do we only subtract in such cases?
3. Should the solution optimize for both performance and memory?

## Strategy

1. **Reverse the Problem**: Instead of transforming `X` to `Y`, transform `Y` to `X`. This simplifies the operations since the inverse of multiplying by 2 is dividing by 2 and the inverse of subtracting 1 is adding 1.
2. **Greedy Approach**: Starting from `Y`, if `Y` is even, divide by 2, else add 1 (to make it even). Repeat until `Y` becomes less than or equal to `X`.
3. **Account for Distance**: If `Y` becomes less than `X`, simply add the difference between `X` and `Y` since only increment operations are needed.

This approach leverages the fact that itâ€™s easier to process `Y` backward rather than `X` forward since one operation (multiplication) grows quickly and the subtraction might become inefficient.

## Code
Here's a JavaScript implementation of the solution:

```javascript
function brokenCalc(X, Y) {
    let operations = 0;
    
    // Work backwards from Y to X
    while (Y > X) {
        // If Y is even, the inverse operation of multiplying by 2 is dividing by 2
        if (Y % 2 === 0) {
            Y /= 2;
        } else {
            // If Y is odd, increment it to make it even
            Y++;
        }
        operations++;
    }
    
    // The remaining difference can be covered by direct subtraction (X - Y times)
    return operations + (X - Y);
}

// Test cases
console.log(brokenCalc(2, 3)); // Output: 2
console.log(brokenCalc(5, 8)); // Output: 2
console.log(brokenCalc(3, 10)); // Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the algorithm is `O(log Y)`. This is because in each step, `Y` is either divided by 2 (which significantly reduces its size) or incremented to make it divisible by 2. This reduction process logarithmically decreases `Y`.

The space complexity is `O(1)` since we are using a constant amount of additional space.

This approach ensures efficiency both in terms of time and space, making it optimal for large values of `Y`.
