[Leetcode 1041. Robot Bounded In Circle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1041)
### Problem Statement

Given an initial position (0, 0) and a direction 'North', write a function `isRobotBounded(instructions)` that returns `true` if the robot is bounded in a circle after following the given instructions indefinitely, otherwise return `false`.

The robot can receive the following instructions:
- 'G': go 1 unit straight in the current direction,
- 'L': turn 90 degrees to the left,
- 'R': turn 90 degrees to the right.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: What is the format of the input?
   - **A**: The input is a single string `instructions` consisting only of characters 'G', 'L', and 'R'.

2. **Q**: Is there a limit to the length of `instructions`?
   - **A**: The problem does not specify constraints, so we assume it can be fairly long.

3. **Q**: Do we repeatedly execute the instructions to check if it's bounded?
   - **A**: Yes, we need to consider the robot's trajectory over multiple cycles if necessary to determine if it is bounded.

### Strategy

To determine if the robot is bounded in a circle:
1. Simulate the robot's movements for one cycle of the given instructions.
2. After one cycle, check the robot's final position and direction.
3. If the robot returns to the initial position `(0,0)`, or is facing a different direction than the initial 'North' after one cycle, it is bounded.

### Code

```javascript
function isRobotBounded(instructions) {
    // Directions are in the order of North, East, South, West
    const directions = [
        [0, 1],  // North
        [1, 0],  // East
        [0, -1], // South
        [-1, 0]  // West
    ];
    
    let x = 0, y = 0; // Starting position
    let directionIndex = 0; // Start facing North

    for (let instr of instructions) {
        if (instr === 'G') {
            x += directions[directionIndex][0];
            y += directions[directionIndex][1];
        } else if (instr === 'L') {
            directionIndex = (directionIndex + 3) % 4; // Turning left
        } else if (instr === 'R') {
            directionIndex = (directionIndex + 1) % 4; // Turning right
        }
    }

    // Robot returns to the initial position or direction is changed.
    return (x === 0 && y === 0) || directionIndex !== 0;
}

// Example test case
console.log(isRobotBounded("GGLLGG")); // Output: true
console.log(isRobotBounded("GG")); // Output: false
console.log(isRobotBounded("GL")); // Output: true
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the number of instructions. We iterate through each instruction once in a single cycle.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\) as we use a constant amount of extra space for variables.
