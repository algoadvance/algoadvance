[Leetcode 2959. Number of Possible Sets of Closing Branches](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2959)
## Problem Statement

You are given a tree rooted at node `0` as an undirected graph with `n` nodes indexed from `0` to `n - 1`, and an array `edges` of `n - 1` edges, where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that there is an edge between nodes `ai` and `bi` in the tree.

Here, a tree is defined as a connected undirected graph with no cycles.

A set of closing branches-out in this tree is a subset of nodes that includes the root `0` and does not include the leaf nodes.

Return the number of possible sets of closing branches-out modulo `10^9 + 7`.

Example 1:
```
Input: n = 4, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,3]]
Output: 4
Explanation: 
There are 4 valid sets of closing branches-out: 
- {0} 
- {0, 1}
- {0, 2}
- {0, 1, 2}
Note that {0, 1, 3} is invalid because it includes a leaf node 3.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Tree Structure**: How is the tree structure given? 
   - Answer: The tree structure is given as an array of edges where each edge represents a connection between two nodes.

2. **Tree Properties**: Are we guaranteed that the input edges form a valid tree?
   - Answer: Yes, we are given that the input forms a valid tree.

3. **Leaf Nodes**: How are leaf nodes defined?
   - Answer: Leaf nodes are nodes that have only one connection (edge) in the tree.

4. **Output**: In what form should the output be?
   - Answer: The number of valid sets modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Strategy

1. **Graph Representation**: First, we need to represent the tree as an adjacency list.
2. **Leaf Identification**: Traverse the adjacency list to identify all leaf nodes.
3. **Valid Node Set**: Construct all valid sets excluding leaf nodes and include the root.
4. **DFS or BFS**: Use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to generate all valid sets and count them.
5. **Modulo Operation**: All operations should be done modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Code

```javascript
const MOD = 10**9 + 7;

function countClosingBranchesOut(n, edges) {
    const graph = new Map();
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        graph.set(i, []);
    }
    for (const [u, v] of edges) {
        graph.get(u).push(v);
        graph.get(v).push(u);
    }

    const leafNodes = new Set();
    const isLeaf = Array(n).fill(false);
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (graph.get(i).length === 1 && i !== 0) {
            leafNodes.add(i);
            isLeaf[i] = true;
        }
    }

    let validSets = 0;

    function dfs(node, parent) {
        let childSet = 1; // Starting with root alone as a valid set
        for (const neighbor of graph.get(node)) {
            if (neighbor === parent) continue;
            const subTreeSet = dfs(neighbor, node);
            if (!isLeaf[neighbor]) {
                childSet = (childSet * (subTreeSet + 1)) % MOD;
            }
        }
        validSets = (validSets + childSet) % MOD;
        return childSet;
    }

    dfs(0, -1);

    return validSets;
}

// Example Usage
const n = 4, edges = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 3]];
console.log(countClosingBranchesOut(n, edges)); // Output: 4
```

This code constructs the tree using an adjacency list, identifies the leaf nodes, and uses DFS to count the number of possible sets of closing branches-out, ensuring that operations are performed under modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Time Complexity

- **Tree Construction:** O(n)
- **DFS Traversal:** O(n)

Overall, the time complexity is O(n).

This approach ensures that we efficiently construct and traverse the tree in linear time, counting valid sets of non-leaf nodes that include the root node.
