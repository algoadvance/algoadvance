[Leetcode 344. Reverse String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l344)
## Problem Statement

The problem is from LeetCode (#344). It states:

"Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with O(1) extra memory."

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Can we assume that the input array of characters is always non-empty?
   - Is the input array always composed of valid single-character strings?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What should be the output if the input array contains only one character?

For this problem, I'll assume the input array is always non-empty and contains valid single-character strings.

## Strategy

We can solve this problem using the two-pointer technique:

1. Initialize two pointers: one at the beginning (`left`) and one at the end (`right`) of the array.
2. Swap the characters at the `left` and `right` pointers.
3. Move the `left` pointer one step to the right and the `right` pointer one step to the left.
4. Repeat steps 2-3 until the two pointers meet or cross each other.

This approach ensures that the string is reversed in-place with O(1) extra memory.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {character[]} s
 * @return {void} Do not return anything, modify s in-place instead.
 */
function reverseString(s) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = s.length - 1;
    
    while (left < right) {
        // Swap elements at left and right indices
        let temp = s[left];
        s[left] = s[right];
        s[right] = temp;
        
        // Move pointers towards the center
        left++;
        right--;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the input array `s`. Each character is processed in a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), because the reversal is done in-place with no extra memory usage apart from a few temporary variables.

This method efficiently reverses the string using minimal space and performs well for any length of the input array.
