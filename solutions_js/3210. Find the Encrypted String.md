[Leetcode 3210. Find the Encrypted String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3210)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` and an integer array `indices` of the same length. The string `s` is encrypted by the following algorithm:

1. For each valid `i`, the character `s[i]` is replaced with the character at the `indices[i]` position in the original string `s`.
2. The goal is to return the decrypted (original) string.

**Example:**

- Input: `s = "aiohn", indices = [3, 1, 4, 2, 0]`
- Output: `"nihao"`

**Explanation:** When `s` is decrypted, the characters at the corresponding positions according to `indices` would be reordered to form the original string `"nihao"`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Are all the characters in the string `s` unique?
   **A**: The problem does not specify, so we should assume they can be any characters.

2. **Q**: Is there any possibility of invalid inputs, such as mismatched lengths for `s` and `indices`?
   **A**: We will assume that `s` and `indices` will always be of the same length and valid as per constraints.

3. **Q**: Can `indices` contain duplicate values?
   **A**: By the problem statement, each value in `indices` should map to a unique character in `s`.

## Code

```javascript
function findEncryptedStringOut(s, indices) {
    const n = s.length;
    let decryptedString = new Array(n);

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        decryptedString[indices[i]] = s[i];
    }

    return decryptedString.join('');
}

// Example usage:
console.log(findEncryptedStringOut("aiohn", [3, 1, 4, 2, 0])); // Output: "nihao"
```

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Create an array `decryptedString` with the same length as `s`, which will hold the characters of the original string.
2. **Populate the Original String**: Iterate over each character of `s` and place it in the correct position in `decryptedString` as specified by `indices`.
3. **Join the Array**: Convert the array back into a string and return it.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The solution runs in O(n) time, where n is the length of the string `s`. This is because we have a single pass through the string and indices to populate the result.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) as we are using an additional array `decryptedString` to store the characters.

This approach ensures we efficiently reconstruct the original string with straightforward iteration and array manipulation.
