[Leetcode 1575. Count All Possible Routes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1575)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of `locations` where `locations[i]` represents the position of a city on a 1-dimensional number line. You are also given integers `start`, `finish`, and `fuel`.

- You start at the city `locations[start]`.
- You want to reach the city `locations[finish]`.
- If you have 0 fuel, you cannot travel to another city.
- You can only move from a city `i` to a city `j` if you have enough fuel `fuel` to travel from city `i` to city `j`.

Return the count of all possible routes from the start city to the finish city, modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we revisit cities?**
   - Yes, you can revisit cities as long as you have sufficient fuel.
   
2. **Is the number of cities `n` small enough for dynamic programming?**
   - Yes, since the constraints are usually within the limits for a DP approach.

3. **Do cities need to be visited in any specific order?**
   - No, cities can be visited in any order as long as you have enough fuel.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach (Top-Down Memoization):**
   - Use DFS with memoization to explore all possible routes from the current city to the destination.
   - Define a memoization table `dp` where `dp[i][fuel]` represents the number of ways to get from city `i` to the `finish` city with `fuel` remaining.

2. **Base Case:**
   - If `i` equals `finish`, initialize the result with 1 (this will be added into the result of every route found).

3. **Recursive Case:**
   - For a given city and remaining fuel, explore all other cities where the fuel allows travel and accumulate the count.

4. **Modulo Operation:**
   - Since the result should be returned modulo `10^9 + 7`, ensure to apply modulo operation at every addition to avoid overflow.

5. **Optimization:**
   - Use memoization to store already computed states to avoid redundant calculations.

### Code

```javascript
var countRoutes = function(locations, start, finish, fuel) {
    const MOD = 10**9 + 7;
    const n = locations.length;
    const memo = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(fuel + 1).fill(-1));

    const dfs = (currCity, remainingFuel) => {
        if (remainingFuel < 0) return 0;
        if (memo[currCity][remainingFuel] !== -1) return memo[currCity][remainingFuel];
        
        let routes = currCity === finish ? 1 : 0;
        
        for (let nextCity = 0; nextCity < n; nextCity++) {
            if (nextCity !== currCity) {
                const fuelCost = Math.abs(locations[currCity] - locations[nextCity]);
                routes = (routes + dfs(nextCity, remainingFuel - fuelCost)) % MOD;
            }
        }
        
        memo[currCity][remainingFuel] = routes;
        return routes;
    };

    return dfs(start, fuel);
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**
  - The time complexity in the worst case is `O(n * fuel * n)` because:
    - For each state `(currCity, remainingFuel)` we iterate over `n` cities.
    - There are `n * fuel` possible states to explore.

Thus, overall complexity with memoization is approximately `O(n^2 * fuel)`.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is `O(n * fuel)` due to the memoization table.
