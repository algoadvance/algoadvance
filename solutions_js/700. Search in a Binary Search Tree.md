[Leetcode 700. Search in a Binary Search Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l700)
## Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer value, you need to write a function to search the BST for this value. If the integer exists in the BST, return the subtree rooted with that node. If the integer does not exist, return `null`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are there any constraints on the values within the binary search tree, such as being non-negative?
   - A: The problem does not specify constraints on values, so assume general integers.
  
2. What should we return if the BST is empty?
   - A: If the BST is empty, the function should return `null`.

3. Can the BST contain duplicate values?
   - A: No, by definition, a binary search tree does not contain duplicate values.

## Strategy
1. The nature of a BST allows us to efficiently search for an element using its properties:
   - For each node:
     - If the target value is equal to the node's value, return the node.
     - If the target value is less than the node's value, recursively search the left subtree.
     - If the target value is greater than the node's value, recursively search the right subtree.
2. This approach ensures an average and worst-case time complexity of O(h), where h is the height of the tree. In the worst case, the height of the tree is O(n) for a completely unbalanced tree.

## Code
Below is the JavaScript implementation of the solution:

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @param {number} val
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var searchBST = function(root, val) {
    // Base case: If the root is null or root's value is the target value
    if (root === null || root.val === val) {
        return root;
    }
    
    // If the target value is less than the root's value, search the left subtree
    if (val < root.val) {
        return searchBST(root.left, val);
    }
    
    // If the target value is greater than the root's value, search the right subtree
    return searchBST(root.right, val);
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Average Case:** O(h), where h is the height of the tree. For a balanced BST, h is O(log n).
- **Worst Case:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. This occurs when the BST is essentially a linked list (completely unbalanced).
