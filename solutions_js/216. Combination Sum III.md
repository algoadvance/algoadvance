[Leetcode 216. Combination Sum III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l216)
## Problem Statement:

Find all possible combinations of `k` numbers that add up to a number `n`, given that only numbers from 1 to 9 can be used and each combination should be a unique set of numbers.

Note:
- All numbers will be positive integers.
- The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

Example:
- Input: `k = 3`, `n = 7`
- Output: `[[1,2,4]]`

- Input: `k = 3`, `n = 9`
- Output: `[[1,2,6], [1,3,5], [2,3,4]]`

## Clarifying Questions:

1. Can the same number be used more than once in one combination?
   - No, each number must be used at most once in each combination.
2. Should the combinations be returned in any specific order?
   - No, the combinations can be returned in any order.
3. What should be returned if no combination meets the criteria?
   - An empty list should be returned if no valid combination is found.

## Strategy:

1. Use a backtracking approach to explore all possible combinations of numbers from 1 to 9.
2. Track the current combination of numbers and their sum.
3. If the current combination length reaches `k` and the sum equals `n`, store the combination.
4. If the combination length exceeds `k` or the sum exceeds `n`, backtrack.
5. Use pruning to skip unnecessary combinations early.

## Code:

```javascript
var combinationSum3 = function(k, n) {
    let result = [];

    const backtrack = (start, combo, sum) => {
        if (combo.length === k) {
            if (sum === n) {
                result.push([...combo]);
            }
            return;
        }

        for (let i = start; i <= 9; i++) {
            if (sum + i > n) break; // Prune the branch if current sum exceeds n
            combo.push(i);
            backtrack(i + 1, combo, sum + i);
            combo.pop(); // backtrack
        }
    };

    backtrack(1, [], 0);
    return result;
};

// Examples
console.log(combinationSum3(3, 7)); // [[1, 2, 4]]
console.log(combinationSum3(3, 9)); // [[1, 2, 6], [1, 3, 5], [2, 3, 4]]
```

## Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this approach is O(9 choose k), which can be expressed as O(9! / (k! * (9 - k)!)). This is because we try all possible combinations of choosing `k` numbers from the set [1, 2, ..., 9].

- For `k = 3`, this choice is C(9, 3) = 84 possible combinations.
- The backtracking ensures that we avoid unnecessary computations by pruning (if the sum exceeds `n`).

Thus, this solution is efficient for the given problem constraints.
