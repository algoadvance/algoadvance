[Leetcode 2155. All Divisions With the Highest Score of a Binary Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2155)
### Problem Statement

You are given a binary array `nums` (consisting of only `0s` and `1s`). We can split it into two (possibly empty) parts: left (before the index `i`) and right (after the index `i`). Imagine that we had a score where we count how many `0s` are there on the left and how many `1s` are there on the right. 

Write a function that returns all the indices which yield the highest score when `nums` is split at that index.

### Example
```javascript
Input: nums = [0,0,1,0]
Output: [2,4]
Explanation: 
Index 0 -> Left: [0,0,1,0] (all zeros = 0), Right: [] (Train zeros = 1)
Index 1 -> Left: [0], Right: [0,1,0] (zeros = 3)
Index 2 -> Left: [0,0], Right: [1,0] => (zeros_right = 1 , 0_zeros = 3)
Index 3 -> Left: [0,0,1], Right: [0]= Same  as above but after 1 ( can loop and verify)
index  4:-> scores = 0_zeros_overall
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Is the length of `nums` restricted?
2. Should we handle cases when `nums` is empty?

### Strategy
1. Calculate the total number of `1`s in the array (let's call this `totalOnes`).
2. Traverse the list and calculate score (sum of zeros on left + sum of ones on right) for each index split.
3. Keep track of the highest score.
4. Return all indices that match the highest score found.

### Time Complexity
- We will traverse the list twice, so the time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of `nums`.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[]}
 */
function maxScoreIndices(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    const totalOnes = nums.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0); // Total count of 1s in the array
    
    let leftZeros = 0;
    let rightOnes = totalOnes;
    let maxScore = 0;
    let scores = [];

    for (let i = 0; i <= n; i++) {
        let currentScore = leftZeros + rightOnes;
        
        if (currentScore > maxScore) {
            maxScore = currentScore;
            scores = [i];
        } else if (currentScore === maxScore) {
            scores.push(i);
        }
        
        if (i < n) {
            // Update leftZeros and rightOnes as we move to the next index
            if (nums[i] === 0) {
                leftZeros++;
            } else {
                rightOnes--;
            }
        }
    }

    return scores;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(maxScoreIndices([0,0,1,0])); // Output: [2,4]
```

### Explanation
1. Initially, count the total number of `1s` in the array.
2. Iterate through each index, computing the score for each split.
3. Track the maximum score and the indices where this maximum score occurs.
4. Return the indices with the highest score.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the indices by making a single pass to count `1s` and another pass to compute scores. This results in an O(n) time complexity solution.
