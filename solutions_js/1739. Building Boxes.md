[Leetcode 1739. Building Boxes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1739)
### Problem Statement

You are tasked with distributing a given number of boxes into stacks in such a way that each stack must be one box taller than the previous stack. Given a number `n`, return the minimum number of height necessary to store all the boxes in this manner.

More formally, you need to find the smallest height `h` such that the sum of the first `h` triangular numbers is at least `n`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input range**: What is the range of `n`?
   - Assume 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
  
2. **Triangular Numbers**: Are we working with the standard triangular number formula? 
   - Yes, triangular_number(k) = k * (k + 1) / 2

3. **Output**: Should the height be an integer?
   - Yes, the height should be an integer.

### Strategy

1. **Triangular Numbers**: Recall that the `k-th` triangular number is given by the formula \( T_k = \frac{k \times (k + 1)}{2} \).

2. **Cumulative Sum of Triangular Numbers**: We sum triangular numbers until the sum is greater than or equal to `n`.

3. **Simulation and Summation**: Start with stack height 1 and keep adding subsequent triangular numbers until the total is at least `n`.

4. **Binary Search for Efficiency**: Use binary search to find the smallest `h` because a brute force solution might be too slow given the constraints.

### Code

```javascript
function minimumBoxes(n) {
    // Function to compute the k-th triangular number
    const triangularNumber = k => (k * (k + 1)) / 2;

    // Find the maximum height such that the number of required boxes is <= n
    let h = 0;
    while (triangularNumber(h + 1) * (h + 2) / 2 <= n) {
        h++;
    }
    
    // Now find the exact number of boxes for the found height
    let totalBoxes = triangularNumber(h) * (h + 1) / 2;
    let lastLayer = 0;
    while (totalBoxes < n) {
        lastLayer++;
        totalBoxes += lastLayer;
    }
    
    return h * (h + 1) / 2 + lastLayer;
}

// Example usage:
// console.log(minimumBoxes(10)); // Expected output should reflect minimum height for 10 boxes
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The initial while loop to determine the height `h` runs in `O(sqrt(n))` since each iteration ensures we are checking a gradually increasing sequence of sums of triangular numbers. The subsequent while loop for adjusting the total box count runs linearly within the remaining deficit, potentially adding a logarithmic factor making it `O(sqrt(n))`.

- **Space Complexity**: The solution uses constant extra space, so the space complexity is `O(1)`.

This code efficiently calculates the minimal stack height required to store all box units given the constraints.
