[Leetcode 2192. All Ancestors of a Node in a Directed Acyclic Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2192)
## Problem Statement

Given a directed acyclic graph (DAG) with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, find all the ancestors for each node in the graph. The graph is represented by a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [from, to]` indicates that there is a directed edge from node `from` to node `to`.

Return a list of lists `ancestors` where `ancestors[i]` is a sorted list of all the ancestors of the `i-th` node.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: n = 5, edges = [[0, 3], [0, 4], [1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 4]]
Output: [[], [], [], [0, 1, 2], [0, 3]]
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= n <= 1000`
- `0 <= edges.length <= min(2000, n * (n - 1) / 2)`
- `edges[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= from, to < n`
- `from != to`
- There are no duplicate edges.
- The graph is directed and acyclic.


## Clarifying Questions

1. **Data Structure for Output**: Should the ancestors for each node be represented as a list of unique integers?
2. **Edge Cases**: Do nodes without any incoming edges need to be included in the final output with an empty list?

## Strategy
1. **Graph Representation**: Use an adjacency list to represent the DAG.
2. **Ancestor Calculation**: Using Depth-First Search (DFS), traverse the graph to find ancestors for each node.
3. **Sorting Ancestors**: After gathering all ancestors for each node, sort the lists before returning the result.

### Steps:
1. Initialize an adjacency list `graph` to represent the given edges.
2. Create an array `ancestors` of sets, where each set at index `i` stores the ancestors of node `i`.
3. Iterate over all nodes and perform a DFS for each node to find its ancestors:
    - For each node, recursively visit all its children and add the node to the child's ancestor set.
4. Convert ancestor sets to sorted lists for the final output.

## Code

```javascript
function getAncestors(n, edges) {
    // Initialize graph as adjacency list and ancestor sets for each node
    const graph = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
    const ancestors = Array.from({ length: n }, () => new Set());
    
    // Build the graph from the edges
    for (const [from, to] of edges) {
        graph[to].push(from);
    }
    
    // DFS function to find all ancestors of a given node
    function dfs(node, curr) {
        for (const parent of graph[curr]) {
            if (!ancestors[node].has(parent)) {
                ancestors[node].add(parent);
                dfs(node, parent);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Find ancestors for each node
    for (let node = 0; node < n; node++) {
        dfs(node, node);
    }
    
    // Convert ancestor sets to sorted lists
    return ancestors.map(set => Array.from(set).sort((a, b) => a - b));
}

// Example usage:
const n = 5;
const edges = [[0, 3], [0, 4], [1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 4]];
console.log(getAncestors(n, edges)); // Expected output: [[], [], [], [0, 1, 2], [0, 3]]
```

## Time Complexity
- **Graph Construction**: O(E), where E is the number of edges.
- **DFS Traversal**: Each node and edge is processed, so in the worst case, O(V + E), where V is the number of vertices.
- **Sorting Ancestors**: Sorting all ancestor sets takes O(V * A log A) where A is the average number of ancestors per node.
Thus, overall time complexity is O(V + E + V * A log A).
