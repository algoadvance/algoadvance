[Leetcode 1764. Form Array by Concatenating Subarrays of Another Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1764)
## Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays `groups` and `nums`. You would like to concatenate the arrays in `groups` in order to form a single array. However, you need to verify if it is possible to form the array `nums` by concatenating the subarrays in `groups` in the given order, without reordering or mixing elements of the subarrays.

Specifically, you need to check if there exists some `i` such that:
- The subarray of `nums` starting from index `i` has the elements of `groups[0]` in the same order.
- Followed by the subarray of `nums` starting from index `i + len(groups[0])` has the elements of `groups[1]` in the same order.
- And so on, until all the elements of `groups` have been concatenated into `nums`.

If it is possible to form the `nums` array as described, return `true`. Otherwise, return `false`.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: groups = [[1, -1, -1], [3, -2, 0]], nums = [1, -1, -1, 3, -2, 0]
Output: true
Explanation: Concatenate [1, -1, -1] then [3, -2, 0] to get [1, -1, -1, 3, -2, 0].
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can `groups` be empty?
2. Can `nums` be empty?
3. Are there constraints on the size of `groups` arrays and `nums`?

Assuming:
1. Both `groups` and `nums` provided are non-empty arrays.
2. There are no specific constraints beyond typical array size limitations (e.g., not excessively large).

## Strategy

1. Initialize an index `i` to keep track of the current position in `nums`.
2. Iterate through each subarray in `groups`.
3. For each subarray, check if it can be found starting from the current index `i` in `nums`.
4. If it is found, move the index `i` forward by the length of the current subarray.
5. If at any point a subarray from `groups` cannot be matched, return `false`.
6. If all subarrays are matched in order, return `true`.

## Code

```javascript
var canChoose = function(groups, nums) {
    let i = 0; // Index in nums

    for (let group of groups) {
        let found = false;
        
        while (i + group.length <= nums.length) {
            let match = true;
            
            for (let j = 0; j < group.length; j++) {
                if (nums[i + j] !== group[j]) {
                    match = false;
                    break;
                }
            }
            
            if (match) {
                found = true;
                i += group.length;
                break;
            }
            
            i++;
        }
        
        if (!found) return false;
    }
    
    return true;
};

// Test the function with example inputs
console.log(canChoose([[1, -1, -1], [3, -2, 0]], [1, -1, -1, 3, -2, 0])); // Output: true
```

## Time Complexity

- The overall time complexity of checking subarrays is `O(n * m)`, where:
  - `n` is the length of `nums`.
  - `m` is the average length of the subarrays in `groups`.
- In the worst case, this involves checking each position in `nums` for potential matches of the subarrays in `groups`.
