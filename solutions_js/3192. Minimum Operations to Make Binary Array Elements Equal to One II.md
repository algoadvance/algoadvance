[Leetcode 3192. Minimum Operations to Make Binary Array Elements Equal to One II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3192)
## Problem Statement
You are given a binary array `nums` which consists of only 0's and 1's. You can perform the following operation on the array any number of times:

- Choose a subarray and flip all the elements in that subarray (i.e., change 0 to 1 and 1 to 0).

Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to make all the elements of the array equal to 1.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the array be empty?
2. What is the maximum length of the array `nums`?
3. Is it guaranteed that the input will only consist of 0's and 1's?

## Strategy
The key insight here is to focus on the "flipping" operation, which means changing a subarray from all 0's to all 1's or vice versa. When we need the entire array to be full of 1â€™s, the optimal strategy tends to be related to counting groups of 0's.

Here is a concise plan:
1. Traverse the array to count the number of groups of consecutive 0's.
2. The number of such groups will give us the minimum number of flip operations required.

For example, if the array is `[0, 0, 1, 0, 1]`, we observe two groups of 0's: `[0, 0]` and `[0]`.

## Code

```javascript
function minOperationsToMakeAllOnes(nums) {
    let count = 0;
    let i = 0;

    while (i < nums.length) {
        if (nums[i] === 0) {
            count++;
            // go over all consecutive 0's
            while (i < nums.length && nums[i] === 0) {
                i++;
            }
        }
        i++;
    }
    
    return count;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the array `nums`. This is because we are traversing the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), since we are using a constant amount of extra space.

This approach efficiently counts the number of groups of 0's in linear time, providing the minimum number of operations required to make all elements in the binary array equal to 1.
