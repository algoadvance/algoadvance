[Leetcode 1009. Complement of Base 10 Integer](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1009)
### Problem Statement

The problem is to find the complement of a given non-negative integer. The complement of a number is defined as flipping all its bits in its binary representation. 

For example:
- Input: 5 (binary representation: 101)
  - Complement: 010
  - Output: 2
- Input: 7 (binary representation: 111)
  - Complement: 000
  - Output: 0

You need to write a function called `bitwiseComplement(n)` that takes a non-negative integer `n` and returns its complement as an integer.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range of Input**: What is the maximum value `n` can take?
   - Since this is based on typical integer constraints, `n` will usually be in the range of a 32-bit integer.
   
2. **Edge Cases**: How should the function handle `n = 0`?
   - The complement of 0 should be 1 because the binary representation of 0 is `0` and its complement is `1`.

### Strategy

1. **Convert the Integer to Binary Representation**:
   - Use JavaScript's `toString(2)` method to convert the number to its binary string form.

2. **Flip the Bits**:
   - Traverse through the binary string and flip each bit. '0' turns into '1' and '1' turns into '0'.

3. **Convert the Flipped Binary String Back to Integer**:
   - Convert the new binary string back to an integer using `parseInt(flipped, 2)`.

4. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the input is `0`, directly return `1`.

### Code

```javascript
function bitwiseComplement(n) {
    // Edge case for n = 0
    if (n === 0) return 1;
    
    // Step 1: Convert to binary
    let binaryStr = n.toString(2);
    
    // Step 2: Flip bits
    let complementStr = '';
    for (let char of binaryStr) {
        complementStr += (char === '0') ? '1' : '0';
    }
    
    // Step 3: Convert back to integer
    return parseInt(complementStr, 2);
}

// Example runs
console.log(bitwiseComplement(5));   // Output: 2
console.log(bitwiseComplement(7));   // Output: 0
console.log(bitwiseComplement(10));  // Output: 5
console.log(bitwiseComplement(0));   // Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity

- **Step 1**: Converting an integer to a binary string takes `O(log n)`, where `n` is the given integer.
- **Step 2**: Flipping the bits involves iterating through the binary string, which also takes `O(log n)`.
- **Step 3**: Converting the flipped binary string back to an integer takes `O(log n)` again.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(log n)`.

This solution efficiently addresses the problem within the constraints, ensuring that the operations scale logarithmically with the size of the input integer.
