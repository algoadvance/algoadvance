[Leetcode 781. Rabbits in Forest](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l781)
### Problem Statement

In a forest, each rabbit has some color. Some rabbits tell you how many other rabbits have the same color as them. Those answers are stored in an array.

Given an array `answers`, where `answers[i]` is the answer of the i<sup>th</sup> rabbit, return the minimum number of rabbits that could be in the forest.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the array size (`answers.length`)?**
   - The array size is between 0 and 1000.

2. **What are the bounds on the values within the array?**
   - Each value in `answers` is between 0 and 1000.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to account for the groups of rabbits that each rabbit claims to see of the same color. Here is a step-by-step plan:

1. **Count Frequency**: Count the frequency of each unique number in `answers` using a hash map.
2. **Calculate Groups**: For each unique answer and its frequency, calculate the minimum number of groups of rabbits using:
   - If a rabbit says there are `k` other rabbits of the same color, there are `k + 1` rabbits in that group.
   - If the number of such answers is more than `k + 1`, we need multiple groups of `k + 1`.
3. **Sum Up Groups**: Sum up all the groups computed to get the minimum number of rabbits.

### Code

Here's how you might implement this:

```javascript
function numRabbits(answers) {
    const count = {};
    for (let answer of answers) {
        if (count[answer] === undefined) {
            count[answer] = 0;
        }
        count[answer]++;
    }

    let totalRabbits = 0;

    for (let key in count) {
        let k = parseInt(key);
        let v = count[key];
        let groupSize = k + 1;
        totalRabbits += Math.ceil(v / groupSize) * groupSize;
    }

    return totalRabbits;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the `answers` array. This is because:
   - Counting frequencies takes O(n).
   - Calculating the number of groups and summing up is O(number of unique answers) which in the worst case is O(n).

- **Space Complexity**: O(n), for storing the frequency count of each unique answer in the hash map.
