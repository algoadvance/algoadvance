[Leetcode 1964. Find the Longest Valid Obstacle Course at Each Position](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1964)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of integers `obstacles`, where `obstacles[i]` represents the height of the i-th obstacle.

For every index `i`, you must find the length of the longest obstacle course in the subarray `obstacles[0]` to `obstacles[i]` (inclusive) such that each obstacle's height is at least as great as the obstacle before it. In other words, you must find the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence for each index `i`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints on the input array:**
   - How large can the array `obstacles` be?
     - **Response:** The array length can be up to 10^5.
   
2. **Range of obstacle heights:**
   - What range of values can the heights of obstacles take?
     - **Response:** Each obstacle height will be between 1 and 10^9.

3. **Output:**
   - What should the function return?
     - **Response:** An array where each element denotes the length of the longest valid obstacle course at that position.

### Code
Let's solve this using a combination of a dynamic array and binary search for efficiency. 

```javascript
function longestObstacleCourseAtEachPosition(obstacles) {
    const n = obstacles.length;
    
    // This will store the answers
    const result = Array(n).fill(0);
    
    // This list will store the ends of the longest subsequence
    let subsequence = [];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Binary search for the largest index `j` such that subsequence[j] <= obstacles[i]
        let left = 0;
        let right = subsequence.length;
        
        while (left < right) {
            let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
            if (subsequence[mid] <= obstacles[i]) {
                left = mid + 1;
            } else {
                right = mid;
            }
        }
        
        // The position in the subsequence array
        let pos = left;
        
        // If pos is equal to the length of subsequence, it means that we have to append the current element
        if (pos === subsequence.length) {
            subsequence.push(obstacles[i]);
        } else {
            // Otherwise, update the subsequence at that position
            subsequence[pos] = obstacles[i];
        }

        // Length of the valid course at this position is pos + 1
        result[i] = pos + 1;
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Strategy
1. **Initialization:**
   - Create an array `result` to store the length of the longest valid obstacle course for each position.
   - Create an array `subsequence` to manage the ends of the longest non-decreasing subsequences found so far.

2. **Iterate through the obstacles:**
   - For each obstacle, determine the position where it fits in the `subsequence` array. This is done using a binary search for efficiency.
     - This search helps to determine the length of the longest subsequence up to this point without violating the order.
     
3. **Update the subsequence array:**
   - Depending on the search results, either append the obstacle to `subsequence` or update an existing position, ensuring that the array remains non-decreasing.

4. **Store result:**
   - The length of the course at each obstacle is the position found plus one (because array indices are 0-based).

### Time Complexity
- The overall time complexity is `O(n log n)` where `n` is the length of the `obstacles` array.
  - This is because binary search is `O(log n)` and we perform it for each element in the `obstacles` array.
  
The provided approach ensures that the problem can be solved efficiently even for large input sizes.
