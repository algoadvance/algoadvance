[Leetcode 1823. Find the Winner of the Circular Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1823)
### Problem Statement
You are given the number `n` people in a circular game and an integer `k`. Each person is standing in a circle, and they are numbered from `1` to `n` in order. The following process is repeated until only one person remains:
1. Start at the current person.
2. Count the next `k` people (including the starting person in counts).
3. The k-th person is removed from the circle.
4. The process starts again from the next person immediately after the removed person.

The task is to return the safe position (1-indexed) of the winner.

#### Example
**Input:** `n = 5`, `k = 2`  
**Output:** `3`  
**Explanation:**
The people are in a circle: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5`. Start counting from `1`:
1. Remove person `2`, circle becomes `1, 3, 4, 5`.
2. Start from `3`, remove `4`, circle becomes `1, 3, 5`.
3. Start from `5`, remove `1`, circle becomes `3, 5`.
4. Start from `3`, remove `5`, circle becomes `3`.

The winner is the person at position `3`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** Is `k` always less than or equal to `n`?
   - **A:** Yes, `k` will always be a valid integer for the given number of people.
2. **Q:** Can `n` be zero?
   - **A:** No, `n` will always be at least `1` according to the problem constraints.
3. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the values of `n` and `k`?
   - **A:** According to typical constraints, `1 <= k, n <= 500`.

### Strategy
The problem is a variation of the famous Josephus Problem which can be solved using a recurrence relation or iteratively. Here's how the problem can be approached:

1. **Base Case:** If there is only one person, the winner is at position `1`.
2. **Recursive Relation:** For position `f(n, k)`:
   - `f(n, k) = (f(n-1, k) + k) % n` where `n` is the total number of people and `k` is the step count.

We can implement this iteratively to avoid deep recursion issues. Adjust final result to 1-based index.

### Code

```javascript
function findTheWinner(n, k) {
    let winner = 0; // winner of 1 person is at position 0 (0-indexed)
    
    // Iterate from 2 persons to n persons
    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        winner = (winner + k) % i;
    }
    
    // Since we're returning 1-indexed result, add 1
    return winner + 1;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(findTheWinner(5, 2)); // Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is **O(n)** because we iterate from `2` to `n`. The space complexity is **O(1)** since we only use a few extra variables irrespective of the input size. This is efficient and suitable for the given problem constraints.
