[Leetcode 3076. Shortest Uncommon Substring in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3076)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of strings `words`, find the shortest string `S` which is not a substring of any string in `words`. If there is more than one possible such string, any of them will be accepted.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the expected output if all characters of the array are same? Will `S` be a single character string which is different from universal set of characters?**
   - Yes, we can take any character that is not within those present in the words.

2. **Are there any constraints on the characters in the strings?**
   - The strings may consist of lowercase English letters only.

3. **How large is the array and the length of each string in the array?**
   - Let's assume the length of the array can be up to 50 and each string length can be up to 100.

4. **Should the solution be optimized for time or space?**
   - Time complexity is more critical here, but ideally, we should aim for a solution that is efficient in both aspects.

## Strategy

The general idea to solve this problem is to start by trying to find the shortest possible substring (not found in any of the provided strings) and then continue progressively to longer substrings if shorter ones are not satisfactory. We will start with all possible one-character substrings, then two-character substrings, and so forth.

We can utilize a breadth-first search (BFS) strategy:
1. Start with all one-character possibilities and check if any are missing from the `words` array.
2. If no one-character substrings are missing, move to two-character substrings, and so forth.
3. If at any step we find a substring that is not present in all of the strings in `words`, we return it immediately.

## Code

```javascript
function findShortestUncommonSubstring(words) {
    const allChars = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz';

    // Helper function to check if a given substring is present in any of the words
    const isSubstringInWords = (substring) => {
        for (const word of words) {
            if (word.includes(substring)) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    };

    // BFS to find the shortest uncommon substring
    let queue = [];
    
    // Enqueue all single character strings
    for (const char of allChars) {
        queue.push(char);
    }

    // Perform BFS
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const current = queue.shift();
        
        // Check if current string is not a substring in any of the words
        if (!isSubstringInWords(current)) {
            return current;
        }

        // Generate all possible next level strings by appending a character
        for (const char of allChars) {
            queue.push(current + char);
        }
    }
}

// Example usage:
const words = ["apple", "banana", "grape"];
console.log(findShortestUncommonSubstring(words)); // Output could be "f" (or any other character not in the words)
```

## Time Complexity

While the BFS approach results in generating and checking many potential substrings, the complexity is based on:
- The size of the alphabet (26 letters for lowercase English letters).
- An increasing length of substrings until we find the shortest one.

This approach explores all combinations systematically, making it efficient for reasonably constrained inputs.

**Time Complexity:** O(n * k + L * 26^L)
- `n` is the number of words in the array.
- `k` is the average length of each word.
- `L` is the length of the currently considered substring.

In the worst-case, this means multiple levels of BFS up to the point where the unique substring is found. Generally, the algorithm will terminate early once it finds the shortest uncommon substring.
