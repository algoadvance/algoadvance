[Leetcode 297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l297)
## Problem Statement
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What should be the format of the serialized string?
   - You can choose any format as long as you can deserialize it back to the original tree structure.

2. What do we do with null nodes/children?
   - You can represent null nodes with a special character (e.g., '#') in your serialized string.

3. Are there any constraints on the size of the tree?
   - Assume the number of nodes in the tree is in the range [0, 10^4].

4. Can the values of the tree nodes be negative or non-integer values?
   - The tree node values will be integer values.

## Strategy
### Serialize
1. Use a pre-order traversal to traverse the tree.
2. Convert the visited nodes' values to a string.
3. For `null` (non-existent) children, append a special character (e.g., '#').

### Deserialize
1. Use a queue structure to recreate the tree.
2. Construct the tree using a pre-order approach based on the serialized values.

### Code
```javascript
function TreeNode(val, left = null, right = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
}

var serialize = function(root) {
    if (!root) return '#';

    const result = [];
    function helper(node) {
        if (!node) {
            result.push('#');
            return;
        }
        result.push(node.val);
        helper(node.left);
        helper(node.right);
    }
    helper(root);
    return result.join(',');
};

var deserialize = function(data) {
    if (data === '#') return null;

    const values = data.split(',');
    let index = 0;

    function helper() {
        if (values[index] === '#') {
            index++;
            return null;
        }

        let node = new TreeNode(parseInt(values[index]));
        index++;
        node.left = helper();
        node.right = helper();
        return node;
    }

    return helper();
};

// Usage example:
const root = new TreeNode(1, new TreeNode(2), new TreeNode(3, new TreeNode(4), new TreeNode(5)));
const serializedData = serialize(root);
console.log(serializedData);
const deserializedTree = deserialize(serializedData);
console.log(deserializedTree);
```

## Time Complexity
- **Serialization**: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.
- **Deserialization**: `O(n)` as well because each value in the serialized string is utilized exactly once during the tree reconstruction.

These complexities are the result of straightforward traversal processes in both serialization and deserialization phases.
