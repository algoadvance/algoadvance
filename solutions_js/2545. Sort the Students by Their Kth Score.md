[Leetcode 2545. Sort the Students by Their Kth Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2545)
### Problem Statement
You are given a 2D integer array `score`, where `score[i]` is the list of scores of the `i-th` student in their exams. Implement a function to sort the students based on their scores in the `k-th` exam. 

Each list contains the same number of elements, and you are guaranteed that `0 <= k < number of exams per student`.

Given:
- `score`: An array of arrays, where each inner array represents scores of a student.
- `k`: An integer representing the exam index by which to sort the students.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What should be the output of the function?
   - The function should return the `score` array sorted based on the `k-th` exam scores (in descending order).

2. Can there be duplicate scores for the `k-th` exam?
   - Yes, there can be duplicate scores. In such cases, any relative order in the sorted array is acceptable.

3. What should be done in case of invalid inputs, such as non-integer values or invalid k?
   - For the scope of this problem, we can assume that inputs are always valid as per the constraints provided.

### Code
```javascript
function sortTheStudents(score, k) {
    return score.sort((a, b) => b[k] - a[k]);
}

// Example usage:
const score = [
    [90, 80, 85],
    [75, 95, 92],
    [88, 79, 84]
];
const k = 1;
console.log(sortTheStudents(score, k));
// Output: [
//    [75, 95, 92],
//    [90, 80, 85],
//    [88, 79, 84]
// ]
```

### Strategy
1. **Sorting Logic**: Use JavaScriptâ€™s `Array.prototype.sort` method to sort the array in-place.
2. **Comparator Function**: The comparator function should compare the `k-th` score of each student. We will sort the array in descending order using `b[k] - a[k]`.

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: The time complexity of the sort function is \(O(n \log n)\), where \(n\) is the number of students.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is \(O(1)\) for the in-place sort operation, but the overall complexity can be \(O(n)\) due to the recursion stack depth in some implementations of sort algorithms.

This ensures an efficient and straightforward solution that leverages built-in array handling capabilities in JavaScript.
