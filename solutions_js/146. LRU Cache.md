[Leetcode 146. LRU Cache](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l146)
### Problem Statement
Design a data structure that follows the constraints of a Least Recently Used (LRU) cache.

Implement the `LRUCache` class:
- `LRUCache(int capacity)` Initializes the LRU cache with **positive size capacity**.
- `int get(int key)` Returns the value of the `key` if the `key` exists, otherwise return -1.
- `void put(int key, int value)` Update the value of the `key` if the `key` exists. Otherwise, add the `key-value` pair to the cache. If the number of keys exceeds the `capacity` from this operation, evict the least recently used key.

The functions `get` and `put` must each run in `O(1)` average time complexity.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Will the `put` and `get` methods always be called with valid integers?**
   - Yes, they will be called with valid integers.
2. **Can the `key` or `value` be negative?**
   - Yes, the `key` and `value` can be negative.
3. **What is the range for the `capacity`?**
   - The capacity will be a positive integer.

### Strategy
To achieve `O(1)` time complexity for both `get` and `put`, we can use a combination of a **HashMap** and a **Doubly Linked List**:
- **HashMap** will provide `O(1)` access to cache items.
- **Doubly Linked List** will maintain the order of usage, allowing `O(1)` updates for recently used items and evictions of the least recently used items.

The doubly linked list will have two sentinel nodes: **head** and **tail**, facilitating easy additions and deletions.

Operations:
1. **Get Operation**: Check if the key exists in the HashMap:
   - If it exists, move the corresponding node to the head of the linked list (indicating it is recently used).
   - Return the value.
   - If it does not exist, return -1.
2. **Put Operation**: 
   - If the key exists, update its value and move it to the head.
   - If the key does not exist, add a new node to the head:
     - If the cache size exceeds the capacity, remove the tail node (the least recently used).

### Code
```javascript
class Node {
  constructor(key, value) {
    this.key = key;
    this.value = value;
    this.prev = null;
    this.next = null;
  }
}

class LRUCache {
  constructor(capacity) {
    this.capacity = capacity;
    this.cache = new Map();
    this.head = new Node(0, 0);  // Sentinel head
    this.tail = new Node(0, 0);  // Sentinel tail
    this.head.next = this.tail;
    this.tail.prev = this.head;
  }

  get(key) {
    if (this.cache.has(key)) {
      let node = this.cache.get(key);
      this._remove(node);
      this._add(node);
      return node.value;
    }
    return -1;
  }

  put(key, value) {
    if (this.cache.has(key)) {
      this._remove(this.cache.get(key));
    }
    let node = new Node(key, value);
    this._add(node);
    this.cache.set(key, node);

    if (this.cache.size > this.capacity) {
      let lru = this.tail.prev;
      this._remove(lru);
      this.cache.delete(lru.key);
    }
  }

  _remove(node) {
    let prevNode = node.prev;
    let nextNode = node.next;
    prevNode.next = nextNode;
    nextNode.prev = prevNode;
  }

  _add(node) {
    let nextNode = this.head.next;
    this.head.next = node;
    node.prev = this.head;
    node.next = nextNode;
    nextNode.prev = node;
  }
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Node Class**: Represents each element in the doubly linked list with `key`, `value`, `prev`, and `next` pointers.
2. **LRUCache Class**:
   - **Constructor**: Initializes with given capacity, HashMap, and sentinel nodes.
   - **get(key)**: Returns value if key exists, otherwise -1, updating usage order.
   - **put(key, value)**: Adds or updates a node and ensures capacity limit is respected by removing the least recently used item if needed.
   - **_remove(node)**: Helper to remove a node from the doubly linked list.
   - **_add(node)**: Helper to add a node right after the head, marking it as most recently used.

### Time Complexity
- **get(key)**: O(1)
- **put(key, value)**: O(1)
Both operations leverage HashMap for constant time access and doubly linked list for constant time updates.
