[Leetcode 813. Largest Sum of Averages](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l813)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `A` and an integer `K`. You need to partition the array into at most `K` non-empty contiguous subarrays, and then calculate the sum of the averages of each subarray. Your task is to return the largest sum of these averages. 

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: A = [9,1,2,3,9], K = 3
Output: 20.0
Explanation: 
The best choice is to partition A into [9], [1, 2, 3], [9]. 
This gives us 9 + (1+2+3)/3 + 9 = 20.
```

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum length of array `A`?
   - What are the possible values of elements in array `A`?
   - What is the range of `K`?

2. **Output Precision:**
   - Should the result be returned as a float with a specific precision?

## Strategy:
To solve this problem, we can use dynamic programming. 

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a 2D DP array `dp` where `dp[i][k]` represents the largest sum of averages we can get by partitioning the first `i` elements of the array into `k` partitions.
   - Create an array `prefix_sum` to store the sum of elements up to index `i` for quick range-sum computation.

2. **State Transition:**
   - Traverse the array and compute possible partitions.
   - For each partition ending at `i` with `k` partitions, try placing the last partition at every possible earlier position `j`, and update `dp[i][k]` as needed.

3. **Optimization:**
   - Use the prefix sum array to compute averages quickly.

## Code:
Here is the JavaScript implementation of the approach described:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} A
 * @param {number} K
 * @return {number}
 */
var largestSumOfAverages = function(A, K) {
    const N = A.length;
    
    // Step 1: Compute prefix sums
    const prefixSum = new Array(N + 1).fill(0);
    for (let i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        prefixSum[i + 1] = prefixSum[i] + A[i];
    }

    // Step 2: Initialize dp array
    const dp = Array.from({length: N + 1}, () => Array(K + 1).fill(0));
    
    // Step 3: Fill dp array for 1 partition
    for (let i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
        dp[i][1] = prefixSum[i] / i;
    }
    
    // Step 4: Compute dp values for more partitions
    for (let k = 2; k <= K; k++) {
        for (let i = 1; i <= N; i++) {
            for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
                dp[i][k] = Math.max(dp[i][k], dp[j][k - 1] + (prefixSum[i] - prefixSum[j]) / (i - j));
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[N][K];
};
```

## Time Complexity:
- Computing the prefix sums is `O(N)`.
- Filling the DP array involves nested loops: The outer loop runs `K` times, the middle loop runs `N` times, and the innermost loop can run up to `N` times. Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(K * N^2)`, which is feasible for moderate-sized arrays and values of `K`.
