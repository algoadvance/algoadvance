[Leetcode 1922. Count Good Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1922)
### Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer `n`. We call a number good if it can be written as the product of a single-digit integer and `10^k` where `0 <= k <= n-1`. Given that we want to find how many approximately good numbers are there in the range `1` to `n`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the input `n`?**
   - The input `n` will be a positive integer.
   
2. **What is meant by "approximately good"?**
   - This refers to a rough count of numbers which can be represented as described above.
   
3. **Do we need any special handling for extremely large or small inputs?**
   - The input size mentioned is not extremely large or small. We can handle large inputs if the constraints are clear.

### Strategy

To solve this, we can observe:

1. We have a number of single-digit integers (from 1 to 9).
2. Each single-digit integer can be multiplied by `10^0, 10^1, 10^2, ..., 10^(k-1)` where the number must lie in the range `1` to `n`.

For example, if `n` is 10:
  - we have: `1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9`

### Code

Here's the Javascript code to solve the problem:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var countGoodNumbers = function(n) {
    const MOD = 10**9 + 7;

    /**
     * Helper function to perform modular exponentiation.
     */
    function power(base, exp, mod) {
        let result = 1;
        base = base % mod;
        while (exp > 0) {
            if (exp % 2 == 1) {
                result = (result * base) % mod;
            }
            exp = Math.floor(exp / 2);
            base = (base * base) % mod;
        }
        return result;
    }
    
    // Half of the positions.
    const half = Math.floor(n / 2);
    const evenCount = n % 2 === 0 ? half : half + 1; 
    const oddCount = half;
    
    // Rear side calculate good numbers
    const result = (power(4, evenCount, MOD) * power(5, oddCount, MOD)) % MOD;
    return result;
};
```

### Strategy Explanation

1. **Initial Observations**:
   - Even indexed positions have 4 possible digits (`2, 4, 6, 8`).
   - Odd indexed positions have 5 possible digits (`0, 1, 2, 3, 4`).

2. **Modulo Arithmetic**: To avoid overflow issues, we are using modulo `10^9 + 7`.
  
3. **Exponentiation**:
   - Calculating power using effective mod exponentiation to compute large power values within limit.

### Time Complexity and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(log n)` for each call to `power` function due to effective power computation (`log-base exponentiation`).
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` since no extra space is necessary that scales with input size.

If any more details should be clarified or additional examples are required, feel free to ask!
