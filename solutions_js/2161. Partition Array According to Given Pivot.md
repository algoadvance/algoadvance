[Leetcode 2161. Partition Array According to Given Pivot](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2161)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and an integer `pivot`, partition the array into three parts:
1. The left part contains all elements less than the pivot.
2. The middle part contains all elements equal to the pivot.
3. The right part contains all elements greater than the pivot.

After partitioning, the relative order of the elements in each part should be the same as in the original array.

Return the array after partitioning it.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the array can contain negative numbers.
2. **Are there any constraints on the length of the array?**
   - The typical constraints should be considered as in most competitive coding problems (e.g., 1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10^5).
3. **Can the pivot be a number not present in the array?**
   - Yes, the pivot can be a number not present in the array.

### Strategy
1. We will iterate through the array three times:
    - First iteration to collect elements less than the pivot.
    - Second iteration to collect elements equal to the pivot.
    - Third iteration to collect elements greater than the pivot.
2. Concatenate these three lists and return the resulting array.

### Code

```javascript
var pivotArray = function(nums, pivot) {
    let lessThanPivot = [];
    let equalToPivot = [];
    let greaterThanPivot = [];
    
    // First pass for elements less than pivot
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (num < pivot) {
            lessThanPivot.push(num);
        }
    }
    
    // Second pass for elements equal to pivot
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (num === pivot) {
            equalToPivot.push(num);
        }
    }
    
    // Third pass for elements greater than pivot
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (num > pivot) {
            greaterThanPivot.push(num);
        }
    }
    
    // Concatenate the three lists
    return [...lessThanPivot, ...equalToPivot, ...greaterThanPivot];
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
   - Each element is processed three times, resulting in a linear complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n)
   - Extra space is used for the three lists `lessThanPivot`, `equalToPivot`, and `greaterThanPivot`.

This solution should be efficient given typical input constraints.
