[Leetcode 2788. Split Strings by Separator](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2788)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string and a separator. Write a function to split the string by the given separator and return an array of strings.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we do with consecutive separators?**: We should treat consecutive separators as separate delimiters, meaning they will produce empty strings in the resulting array.
2. **Should we trim the resulting strings?**: No, we should preserve the original substrings including leading/trailing spaces.
3. **What if the string is empty or consists only of separators?**: The function should still return an array of substrings according to the rules above.

### Code

```javascript
function splitString(input, separator) {
    return input.split(separator);
}

// Example Usage
console.log(splitString("a,b,c", ",")); // Output: ["a", "b", "c"]
console.log(splitString("a,,c", ","));  // Output: ["a", "", "c"]
console.log(splitString(",,", ","));    // Output: ["", "", ""]
console.log(splitString("", ","));      // Output: [""]
```

### Strategy

1. **Use the `split` method**: JavaScript provides a built-in method called `split` which is specifically designed to divide a string into an ordered list of substrings, putting the substrings into an array, and returning the array.
  
2. **Operate on edge cases**: When the input string is empty or consists only of the separator(s), the `split` method should handle it gracefully by providing an array consistent with the rules of splitting.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the input string. This is because the `split` method needs to traverse the entire string to identify all instances of the separator and segment the string accordingly. 

- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also **O(n)** in the worst case. This accounts for storing the resulting array of substrings.
