[Leetcode 1582. Special Positions in a Binary Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1582)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `mat` (containing only 0's and 1's). A position `(i, j)` in the matrix is called special if `mat[i][j] == 1` and all other elements in row `i` and column `j` are 0 (except for the cell `(i, j)` itself).

Return the number of special positions in `mat`.

### Example

**Example 1**

```
Input: mat = [[1,0,0],[0,0,1],[1,0,0]]
Output: 1
```
**Example 2**

```
Input: mat = [[1,0,0],[0,1,0],[0,0,1]]
Output: 3
```

### Constraints

- `m == mat.length`
- `n == mat[i].length`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `mat[i][j]` is either `0` or `1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume that the matrix is always valid and contains only 0's and 1's?
2. What should be the output if there are no special positions in the matrix? (Assume 0)
3. Is there any constraint on the time complexity for the solution?

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. Iterate through the whole matrix to locate positions of all the 1â€™s.
2. For each position `(i, j)` that contains a `1`, check if all the other elements in row `i` and column `j` are `0`.
3. Count and return the number of special positions.

Steps to implement:

1. Iterate through the matrix to get the positions of all `1`s.
2. For each `1` at position `(i, j)`, verify if the rest of the row `i` and column `j` contain only `0`s.
3. Maintain a counter to count the number of special positions.

## Code

```javascript
function numSpecial(mat) {
    let specialCount = 0;
    let rows = mat.length;
    let cols = mat[0].length;
    
    function isSpecial(i, j) {
        for (let k = 0; k < cols; k++) {
            if (k !== j && mat[i][k] === 1) return false;
        }
        for (let k = 0; k < rows; k++) {
            if (k !== i && mat[k][j] === 1) return false;
        }
        return true;
    }
    
    for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            if (mat[i][j] === 1 && isSpecial(i, j)) {
                specialCount++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return specialCount;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(m * n * (m + n))`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. This is because for each `1` found, we may potentially check all the elements of its row and column, resulting in `(m + n)` checks for each `1`.
