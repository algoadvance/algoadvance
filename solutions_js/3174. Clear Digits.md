[Leetcode 3174. Clear Digits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3174)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `num` representing a large number. You need to remove `k` digits from the number such that the new number is the smallest possible. You are required to return this new number as a string. 

Note that the resulting number should not contain any leading zeros unless it is a single zero.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the maximum length of the string `num` and the value of `k`?
   - **Answer**: Generally, the length of `num` and the value of `k` can be very large, reaching up to tens of thousands.

2. **Leading Zeros**: Should we handle leading zeros in the final output?
   - **Answer**: Yes, the final number should not contain leading zeros unless it is the single digit zero.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - What should be returned if `k` equals the length of `num`?
     - If `k` equals the length of `num`, return "0" since all digits will be removed.

### Strategy

The strategy involves using a stack to iteratively build the smallest possible number by ensuring that each digit added keeps the number minimal:

1. **Using a Stack**: 
   - Traverse through each digit in `num`.
   - Use a stack to keep track of the current smallest sequence of digits:
     - Pop the stack while the current digit is smaller than the stack's top element and `k` is greater than 0 (since we still have removals left).
     - Push the current digit onto the stack.
   - If there are still digits to remove after processing all characters, remove them from the end.

2. **Post Processing**:
   - Convert the stack back into a number string.
   - Remove any leading zeros.

3. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - If the resultant string is empty, return "0".

### Code

```javascript
function removeKdigits(num, k) {
    const stack = [];
    for (let digit of num) {
        while (stack.length > 0 && k > 0 && stack[stack.length - 1] > digit) {
            stack.pop();
            k--;
        }
        stack.push(digit);
    }
    
    // Edge case for remaining digits to remove
    while (k > 0) {
        stack.pop();
        k--;
    }
    
    // Concatenate stack to get the final number
    let result = stack.join('');
    
    // Remove leading zeros
    result = result.replace(/^0+/, '');
    
    return result === '' ? '0' : result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string `num`. This is because each digit is processed at most twice (once pushed onto the stack and once popped).

### Explanation

1. **Stack Usage**: 
   - Using a stack to maintain a sequence where for every digit (`digit` from `num`), we keep removing the top of the stack while it's greater than `digit` and `k` is positive.
   - This ensures that the smaller digits are more to the left, creating a smaller number.

2. **Leading Zeros**:
   - After constructing the number from the stack, leading zeros are removed using a regular expression.

3. **Final Check**:
   - If the resultant string is empty, it implies all digits were removed, thus return "0".

This method ensures the smallest possible resultant number by prioritizing smaller digits first and maintaining linear complexity.
