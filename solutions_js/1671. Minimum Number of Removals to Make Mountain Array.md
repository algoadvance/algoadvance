[Leetcode 1671. Minimum Number of Removals to Make Mountain Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1671)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums`. A mountain array is defined as an array that:

1. Has at least three elements.
2. There exists some element `i` (0-based) with `0 < i < nums.length - 1` such that:
   - `nums[0] < nums[1] < ... < nums[i - 1] < nums[i]`
   - `nums[i] > nums[i + 1] > ... > nums[nums.length - 1]`

Your task is to return the minimum number of elements to remove from the array to make it a mountain array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the input array contain duplicate elements?
   - No, according to the problem statement all elements in the array `nums` are unique.
2. What is the size range of the input array `nums`?
   - The length of `nums` can be from 1 to 10^5.
3. What should be returned if the array cannot be converted into a mountain array?
   - You should return the number of elements needed to remove, which, in the worst case, is `nums.length - 3`.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can adopt a dynamic programming approach along with some pre-computation:

1. **Step 1: Compute Increasing Subsequences.**
   - Create DP arrays (`incr`) to store the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each index.
   
2. **Step 2: Compute Decreasing Subsequences.**
   - Create DP arrays (`decr`) to store the length of the longest decreasing subsequence starting at each index.
   
3. **Step 3: Identify Mountain Peaks.**
   - For each index `i`, check if it can act as the peak of a mountain (i.e., `incr[i] > 1` and `decr[i] > 1`).
   - For valid peaks, compute the length of the mountain and track the maximum length found.
   
4. **Step 4: Compute the Minimum Removals.**
   - The minimum number of elements to remove is the size of the array minus the length of the longest identified mountain.

### Code

```javascript
function minimumMountainRemovals(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    
    // DP arrays for increasing subsequences and decreasing subsequences
    const incr = new Array(n).fill(1);
    const decr = new Array(n).fill(1);
    
    // Compute lengths of the longest increasing subsequences ending at each index
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (nums[j] < nums[i]) {
                incr[i] = Math.max(incr[i], incr[j] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Compute lengths of the longest decreasing subsequences starting at each index
    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        for (let j = n - 1; j > i; j--) {
            if (nums[j] < nums[i]) {
                decr[i] = Math.max(decr[i], decr[j] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    
    let maxMountainSize = 0;
    
    // Find the maximum length of the mountain array
    for (let i = 1; i < n - 1; i++) {
        if (incr[i] > 1 && decr[i] > 1) {
            maxMountainSize = Math.max(maxMountainSize, incr[i] + decr[i] - 1);
        }
    }
    
    // The minimum number of removals
    return n - maxMountainSize;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **O(n^2)** due to the nested loops needed for the DP computation.

In this solution, we iterate over the input array with nested loops to fill up the `incr` and `decr` arrays, resulting in a time complexity of O(n^2). Given the constraints, this solution is efficient and should perform adequately within the input range limits.
