[Leetcode 2966. Divide Array Into Arrays With Max Difference](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2966)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Divide the array into the maximum number of non-empty subarrays such that each subarray has `k` as the maximum difference between its maximum and minimum elements. Return the maximum number of subarrays you can obtain.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of the input values?**
   - The length of `nums` can be up to `10^5`.
   - The values of the integers in `nums` can range from `-10^4` to `10^4`.

2. **Can the subarrays overlap?**
   - No, subarrays must be non-overlapping.

3. **What should be returned if it's not possible to form any subarray with the given restriction?**
   - Return 0 if no subarray can be formed.

4. **Can we assume the input will always have at least one element?**
   - Yes, the length of `nums` is at least 1.

5. **Should we consider the order of elements in `nums` while forming subarrays?**
   - Yes, the order must be maintained as per the array's sequence.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Use a `count` variable to keep track of the number of valid subarrays.
   - Use two pointers to traverse through the array, `start` and `end`.

2. **Two-Pointer Technique**:
   - For each starting position (`start`), extend the ending position (`end`) while the difference between max and min elements in the current subarray from `start` to `end` is within `k`.
   - If extending the `end` pointer violates the condition, we have found a valid subarray, and we move `start` to the next position to search for another valid subarray.

3. **Update max and min Values**:
   - Maintain the current maximum and minimum values within the window defined by `start` and `end` pointers.

4. **Edge Case**:
   - If the array has only one element, it forms a valid subarray by itself.

### Code

```javascript
function divideArray(nums, k) {
    let count = 0;
    let start = 0;

    while (start < nums.length) {
        let end = start;
        let currentMax = nums[start];
        let currentMin = nums[start];

        while (end < nums.length && currentMax - currentMin <= k) {
            currentMax = Math.max(currentMax, nums[end]);
            currentMin = Math.min(currentMin, nums[end]);

            if (currentMax - currentMin <= k) {
                end++;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }

        count++;
        start = end;  // Move to the next starting point to search for another subarray
    }

    return count;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the input array `nums`.
  - We are using a two-pointer technique where each element in the array will be processed at most twice (once considered as a starting point and at most once extended as an ending point).
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - We are using only a few extra variables to maintain the current state, independent of the input size.

This approach ensures that we are efficiently finding the maximum number of subarrays while maintaining the required condition.
