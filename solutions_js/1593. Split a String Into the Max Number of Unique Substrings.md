[Leetcode 1593. Split a String Into the Max Number of Unique Substrings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1593)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, split it into the maximum number of unique substrings. Return the maximum number of unique substrings that the given string can be split into.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Can the string be empty?
   - What is the maximum length of the string?
   - Are there any specific characters allowed or disallowed in the string?

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Should the substrings be contiguous?
   - Is there any specific return format or just the count of unique substrings is sufficient?

Let's assume the following based on common problem constraints:
- The string can be non-empty.
- The length of the string is reasonably small such that brute force or backtracking solutions are feasible.
- Only standard alphanumeric characters are in the string.
- Substrings must be contiguous.
- Return the count of unique substrings.

### Strategy
To maximize the number of unique substrings, we can use a backtracking approach:
1. **Backtracking**: We'll try breaking the string at different points and recursively attempt to maximize the number of unique substrings.
2. **Set for Uniqueness**: Use a set to keep track of the unique substrings encountered so far during the backtracking process.
3. **Recursive Function**: Define a recursive function that will:
   - Try every possible split.
   - Add the split substring to the set if it's not already there.
   - Recur for the remainder of the string.
   - Backtrack by removing the substring from the set after the recursive call to explore other possibilities.
   
### Code
```javascript
function maxUniqueSplit(s) {
    let maxUniqueCount = 0;
    
    function backtrack(start, uniqueSubstrings) {
        if (start == s.length) {
            maxUniqueCount = Math.max(maxUniqueCount, uniqueSubstrings.size);
            return;
        }

        for (let end = start + 1; end <= s.length; end++) {
            let substring = s.slice(start, end);
            if (!uniqueSubstrings.has(substring)) {
                uniqueSubstrings.add(substring);
                backtrack(end, uniqueSubstrings);
                uniqueSubstrings.delete(substring);
            }
        }
    }

    backtrack(0, new Set());
    return maxUniqueCount;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The function explores all possible ways to split the string:
- In the worst case, this would be effectively generating and storing a subset of all possible substrings.
- The number of substrings can be estimated by \( O(2^n) \) where \( n \) is the length of the string because we could treat every character as a potential split point.

Given the potentially exponential nature of the problem with backtracking, this is efficient enough for reasonably small strings (length up to 20-25).

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is dominated by the recursive call stack and the set used to keep track of unique substrings:
- The depth of the recursion can be up to \( O(n) \) (number of splits and call stack depth).
- The set can hold up to \( O(n) \) substrings in the worst case. So, total space complexity is \( O(n) \).
