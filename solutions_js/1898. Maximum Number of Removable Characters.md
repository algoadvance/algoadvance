[Leetcode 1898. Maximum Number of Removable Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1898)
### Problem Statement

The problem is defined as follows:

You are given two strings, `s` and `p`, where `p` is a subsequence of `s`. You are also given an integer array, `removable`, which contains indices of characters in `s` to be removed.

In one step, you can remove the character at the given index in the `removable` array. You will need to return the maximum number of characters you can remove from `s` such that `p` is still a subsequence of `s`.

### Clarifying Questions

Before we proceed, letâ€™s clarify a few things:

1. **Is string `p` always a valid subsequence of `s` when no characters are removed?**
   - Yes.
2. **Can the `removable` array contain duplicate indices?**
   - No, it will contain unique indices.
3. **What is the length range for strings `s` and `p`, and the array `removable`?**
   - Typical constraints are:
     - \( 1 \leq |s| \leq 10^5 \)
     - \( 1 \leq |p| \leq 10^5 \)
     - \( 1 \leq |\text{removable}| \leq \min(10^5, |s|) \)

### Strategy

1. **Binary Search Approach:** The main objective is to find the maximum number of removable characters while ensuring `p` is still a subsequence of `s`. Using binary search can help us optimize the search process.

2. **Subsequence Check:** After removing characters up to a midpoint defined in the binary search, we need to verify if `p` is still a subsequence of the remaining string `s`. We can use a two-pointer technique to check if `p` is a subsequence of the modified `s`.

Here's the broader strategy:

- Use binary search to determine the maximum `k` such that `p` is still a subsequence of `s` after removing the first `k` indices from the `removable` array.
- For each midpoint in the binary search, simulate the removal of characters and check if `p` remains a subsequence.

### Code

```javascript
function isSubsequence(s, p, removed) {
    let pIndex = 0;
    let sIndex = 0;
    
    while (sIndex < s.length && pIndex < p.length) {
        if (!removed[sIndex] && s[sIndex] === p[pIndex]) {
            pIndex++;
        }
        sIndex++;
    }
    
    return pIndex === p.length;
}

function maximumRemovals(s, p, removable) {
    let left = 0;
    let right = removable.length;
    let maxRemovals = 0;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        let removed = Array(s.length).fill(false);
        
        for (let i = 0; i < mid; i++) {
            removed[removable[i]] = true;
        }
        
        if (isSubsequence(s, p, removed)) {
            maxRemovals = mid;
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    
    return maxRemovals;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search:** \(O(\log n)\)
- **Subsequence Check:** For each midpoint, check if `p` is a subsequence of `s`. This step needs to run a two-pointer technique which is \(O(|s| + |p|)\).
  
Combining these, the overall time complexity is \(O((|s| + |p|) \log(n))\), where \(n\) is the length of the `removable` array. 

This should be efficient enough given the constraints.
