[Leetcode 950. Reveal Cards In Increasing Order](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l950)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `deck` representing a deck of cards where `deck[i]` represents the `i-th` card in the deck. The cards in the deck are unique.

You can order the deck in any order you want. Initially, all the cards start face down (unrevealed) in one deck.

You will do the following steps repeatedly until all cards are revealed:

1. Take the top card of the deck, reveal it, and take it out of the deck.
2. If there are still cards in the deck, put the next top card of the deck at the bottom of the deck.
3. Repeat this process until all the cards are revealed.

Return an ordering of the deck that would reveal the cards in increasing order.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: deck = [17,13,11,2,3,5,7]
Output: [2,13,3,11,5,17,7]
Explanation: 
We get the deck in the order [2,13,3,11,5,17,7] by the following sequence:
Reveal [2], put it at the bottom of the deck: [13,3,11,5,17,7]
Reveal [13], put it at the bottom of the deck: [3,11,5,17,7,13]
Reveal [3], put it at the bottom of the deck: [11,5,17,7,13]
Reveal [11], put it at the bottom of the deck: [5,17,7,13,11]
Reveal [5], put it at the bottom of the deck: [17,7,13,11,5]
Reveal [17], put it at the bottom of the deck: [7,13,11,5]
Reveal [7]
Since all the cards are revealed in increasing order, the answer is correct.
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= deck.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= deck[i] <= 10^6`
- All the values of `deck` are unique.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume that the `deck` array always contains unique elements?
   - Yes, per the problem constraints, all values are unique.
   
2. Is the final output supposed to represent the index order of the original array or the rearranged values of the deck?
   - The final output should be the rearranged values of the deck such that when the cards are revealed in the specified manner, they appear in increasing order.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Deck**: Start by sorting the `deck` array in ascending order to ensure smallest elements come first.
2. **Simulate the Process**:
    - Use a deque (a double-ended queue) to simulate the revealing process.
    - For each element in the sorted array:
      - Append it to the result array after rotating the deque structure such that the order mimics the revealing process as described.
      - If there are any cards already in the deque, move the card on the top to the bottom.
    
By doing this, we can backfill the required order to achieve the desired revealing sequence.

### Code

```javascript
function deckRevealedIncreasing(deck) {
    deck.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let indexQueue = Array.from({ length: deck.length }, (_, i) => i);
    let result = Array(deck.length).fill(0);
    
    for (let card of deck) {
        result[indexQueue.shift()] = card;
        if (indexQueue.length) {
            indexQueue.push(indexQueue.shift());
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Example usage:
let deck = [17, 13, 11, 2, 3, 5, 7];
console.log(deckRevealedIncreasing(deck));  // Output: [2, 13, 3, 11, 5, 17, 7]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: Sorting the `deck` array takes `O(N log N)` time, where `N` is the number of cards.
- **Queue Operations**:
  - The `shift` operation takes `O(1)` time.
  - The `push` operation also takes `O(1)` time.
  - Each of the `N` insertions and rotations (queue manipulations) also take `O(N)` time in total after sorting.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, making it **O(N log N)**.
