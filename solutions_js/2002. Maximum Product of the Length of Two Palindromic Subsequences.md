[Leetcode 2002. Maximum Product of the Length of Two Palindromic Subsequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2002)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s`. You need to find the maximum product of the lengths of two non-overlapping palindromic subsequences of the string.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. A palindromic subsequence is a subsequence that reads the same backward as forward.

#### Example
**Input:**
```javascript
s = "abacaba"
```
**Output:**
```javascript
9
```
**Explanation:**
The two non-overlapping palindromic subsequences are "aba" and "aca". Their lengths, when multiplied, yield the maximum product: `3 * 3 = 9`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum length of the string `s`?**
   - The maximum length of the string can be up to 12.

2. **Can the same character in the string be used in both subsequences?**
   - Yes, as long as they are in different positions and the subsequences do not overlap.

3. **Should the solution focus on efficiency given the constraints?**
   - Given the length constraint (maximum 12), we can use a combinatorial approach, which might be less efficient for larger strings but feasible for this problem.

### Strategy

1. **Generate Subsequences:**
   - Create all possible subsequences of the string `s`. 

2. **Check for Palindromes:**
   - Verify which of these subsequences are palindromic.

3. **Non-overlapping Check:**
   - Ensure that the two subsequences do not overlap.

4. **Calculate Product:**
   - For every pair of non-overlapping palindromic subsequences, calculate the product of their lengths.

5. **Keep Track of Maximum Product:**
   - Return the maximum product found.

### Code

```javascript
function maxProduct(s) {
    const isPalindrome = (seq) => {
        let left = 0, right = seq.length - 1;
        while (left < right) {
            if (seq[left] !== seq[right]) return false;
            left++;
            right--;
        }
        return true;
    };

    const generateSubsequences = (s) => {
        let subsequences = [];
        let n = s.length;
        for (let i = 0; i < (1 << n); i++) {
            let subseq = "";
            for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i & (1 << j)) {
                    subseq += s[j];
                }
            }
            subsequences.push(subseq);
        }
        return subsequences;
    };

    const subsequences = generateSubsequences(s);
    const palindromes = subsequences.filter(isPalindrome);

    let maxProduct = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < palindromes.length; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < palindromes.length; j++) {
            const seq1 = palindromes[i];
            const seq2 = palindromes[j];
            const used = new Array(s.length).fill(false);

            let k = 0;
            for (let l = 0; l < s.length; l++) {
                if (k < seq1.length && s[l] === seq1[k]) {
                    used[l] = true;
                    k++;
                }
            }

            k = 0;
            let overlap = false;
            for (let l = 0; l < s.length; l++) {
                if (k < seq2.length && s[l] === seq2[k]) {
                    if (used[l]) {
                        overlap = true;
                        break;
                    }
                    k++;
                }
            }

            if (!overlap) {
                maxProduct = Math.max(maxProduct, seq1.length * seq2.length);
            }
        }
    }
    return maxProduct;
}

// Example usage
const s = "abacaba";
console.log(maxProduct(s)); // Output: 9
```

### Time Complexity

- **Generate Subsequences:** There are `2^n` subsequences for a string of length `n`.
- **Check Palindromes:** Each check is O(n) and we have `2^n` subsequences.
- **Combining Subsequences:** Pairing palindromic subsequences is O((2^n)^2).

Given n = 12:

- **Subsequence Generation and Filtering:** O(2^n * n)
- **Pair Checking:** O((2^n)^2) = O(4^n)

Our approach is very combinatorial with a time complexity of O(4^n). However, for n <= 12, this is feasible.
