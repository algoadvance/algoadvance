[Leetcode 1462. Course Schedule IV](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1462)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n` which indicates the number of courses, labeled from `0` to `n-1`. You are also given a 2D array `prerequisites` where `prerequisites[i] = [ai, bi]` indicates that you must take course `ai` before taking course `bi`. Additionally, you are given a 2D array `queries` where `queries[j] = [uj, vj]`. For each query `queries[j]`, return `true` if `uj` is a prerequisite of `vj`, and `false` otherwise.

Return a boolean array of the answers to each query.

#### Example:
```plaintext
Input: n = 2, prerequisites = [[0,1]], queries = [[0,1],[1,0]]
Output: [true, false]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can there be duplicate entries in `prerequisites` or `queries`?**
   - No, the inputs should be unique as per the problem constraints.
  
2. **Are there any constraints on the size of `n`, `prerequisites`, or `queries`?**
   - Yes, typical constraints for such problems are:
     - `1 <= n <= 100`
     - `0 <= prerequisites.length <= (n * (n - 1) / 2)`
     - `0 <= ai, bi < n`
     - `0 <= queries.length <= 10^4`
     - `0 <= uj, vj < n`

3. **How should we handle the case where `uj` and `vj` are the same in a query?**
   - Since a course is not a prerequisite for itself, the answer should be `false` in such cases.

### Strategy

To determine whether a course is a prerequisite for another, we essentially need to check for reachability in a directed graph:
1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the courses and prerequisites as a directed graph.
2. **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: Use the Floyd-Warshall algorithm to determine the transitive closure of the graph, allowing us to determine reachability between any two nodes (courses).

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} prerequisites
 * @param {number[][]} queries
 * @return {boolean[]}
 */
const checkIfPrerequisite = (n, prerequisites, queries) => {
    // Initialize the adjacency matrix with `Infinity` to indicate no direct path initially
    const reach = Array.from({length: n}, () => Array(n).fill(false));

    // Set the prerequisites in the adjacency matrix
    for (const [u, v] of prerequisites) {
        reach[u][v] = true;
    }

    // Floyd-Warshall Algorithm to find all reachable pairs
    for (let k = 0; k < n; k++) {
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (reach[i][k] && reach[k][j]) {
                    reach[i][j] = true;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Answer the queries based on the transitive closure
    return queries.map(([u, v]) => reach[u][v]);
};

// Example usage:
const n = 2;
const prerequisites = [[0, 1]];
const queries = [[0, 1], [1, 0]];
console.log(checkIfPrerequisite(n, prerequisites, queries)); // Output: [true, false]
```

### Time Complexity

- **Graph Initialization**: O(n^2) to initialize the reachability matrix.
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: O(n^3) due to three nested loops each running `n` times.
- **Query Processing**: O(q) where `q` is the number of queries, as each query takes O(1) time to check the precomputed reachability.

Considering the constraints, `n` is at most 100, making the cubic complexity feasible in practice. Each query can be processed in constant time after precomputing the reachability.
