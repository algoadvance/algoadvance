[Leetcode 400. Nth Digit](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l400)
### Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem [400. Nth Digit](https://leetcode.com/problems/nth-digit/)

Find the `n`th digit of the infinite integer sequence [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...]. Note that `n` can be very large.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**: What is the maximum possible value of `n`?
   - Given the problem constraint from Leetcode, `n` can be as large as \(2^{31} - 1\).

2. **Output Type**: Should the output be a string or an integer?
   - The output should be an integer.

3. **Understanding Sequence**: We need to find the `n`th digit in the infinite sequence formed by all positive integers concatenated together.

### Strategy

The main concept is to figure out in which range (1-9, 10-99, 100-999, etc.) the `n`th digit falls, and then identify the specific number and digit within that number.

1. **Identify the digit length range**:
   - Start from single digits (1-9), which have lengths of 1.
   - Move to double digits (10-99), which have lengths of 2.
   - Continue to higher ranges (100-999), which have lengths of 3.
   - Until the range where the `n`th digit falls.

2. **Find the precise number**:
   - Once the range is identified, calculate which number within that range contains the `n`th digit.

3. **Extract the digit**:
   - Convert the number into a string to easily extract the desired digit.

### Code

```javascript
function findNthDigit(n) {
    let digitLength = 1;
    let count = 9;
    let start = 1;

    // Step 1: Identify the range
    while (n > digitLength * count) {
        n -= digitLength * count;
        digitLength++;
        count *= 10;
        start *= 10;
    }

    // Step 2: Find the number within the identified range
    start += Math.floor((n - 1) / digitLength);

    // Step 3: Find the exact digit in the number
    let s = start.toString();
    let digitIndex = (n - 1) % digitLength;
    return parseInt(s[digitIndex]);
}

// Example usage:
// The 11th digit in the sequence is '0' from '10'
console.log(findNthDigit(11)); // Output: 0
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initial Range Identification**: This part iteratively reduces `n` and effectively scales with the number of digits (logarithmic in respect to `n`). This typically doesn't exceed more than a few iterations.
  
- **Finding the Number**: Simple arithmetic and string conversion which is negligible in terms of complexity.

- **Extracting the Digit**: Direct access operation on the string.

Overall, the time complexity is **O(log n)** where \(n\) is the input value.

With these steps, the solution efficiently narrows down the exact digit needed from the infinite sequence of integers concatenated together.
