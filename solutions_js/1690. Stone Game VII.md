[Leetcode 1690. Stone Game VII](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1690)
### Problem Statement
Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

There are `n` stones arranged in a row. On each player's turn, they can remove either the leftmost stone or the rightmost stone from the row and receive points equal to the sum of the remaining stones' values in the row. The game ends when there are no more stones left to remove.

The objective of the game is to maximize the difference in Alice's and Bob's scores. Alice wants to maximize `Alice_score - Bob_score`, while Bob wants to minimize it.

Given an integer array `stones` of length `n` where `stones[i]` is the value of the `i-th` stone, return the maximum difference in Alice's and Bob's scores that Alice can achieve if both play optimally.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the array size, `n`, and the values within the array?**
   - This helps evaluate whether a brute force solution is feasible or if dynamic programming/memoization should be used.

2. **Are there constraints on the solutions' performance or time complexity?**
   - Knowing this helps decide if our approach is optimal or needs improvements.

### Strategy
To solve this problem optimally, we can use dynamic programming to keep track of the maximum score difference Alice can achieve over Bob.

- We'll use an array `dp` to store intermediate results. 
- `dp[i][j]` will represent the maximum score difference that Alice can achieve over Bob for the subarray `stones[i...j]`.

The recurrence relation can be broken down:
1. If Alice removes the leftmost stone, the remaining stones are from `i+1` to `j`. The score difference for Alice is the sum of the remaining stones minus whatever maximum score difference Bob can achieve from this subarray. 
2. If Alice removes the rightmost stone, the remaining stones are from `i` to `j-1`. Similarly, Alice's score difference here is the sum of the remaining stones minus whatever maximum score difference Bob can achieve from this subarray. 

### Code

```javascript
var stoneGameVII = function(stones) {
    let n = stones.length;
    let prefixSum = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    
    // Compute prefix sums
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        prefixSum[i + 1] = prefixSum[i] + stones[i];
    }

    // Create a dp array initialized to 0
    let dp = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(0));

    // Fill dp table
    for (let length = 2; length <= n; length++) {
        for (let i = 0; i <= n - length; i++) {
            let j = i + length - 1;
            let sumRemaining = prefixSum[j + 1] - prefixSum[i];
            
            // If Alice picks the leftmost stone
            let pickLeft = sumRemaining - stones[i] - dp[i + 1][j];
            // If Alice picks the rightmost stone
            let pickRight = sumRemaining - stones[j] - dp[i][j - 1];

            dp[i][j] = Math.max(pickLeft, pickRight);
        }
    }

    return dp[0][n - 1];
};

```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n^2)` because we fill an `n*n` DP array and each cell computation involves constant time operations.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n^2)` for the DP table and `O(n)` for the prefix sums.

This solution efficiently handles the problem within the dynamic programming constraints.
