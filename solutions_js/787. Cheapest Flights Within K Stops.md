[Leetcode 787. Cheapest Flights Within K Stops](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l787)
## Problem Statement

You are given a set of cities connected by various flights. Each flight has a cost associated with it, and you need to find the cheapest flight from a starting city to a destination city, given that you can make at most `k` stops in between.

**Input:**
- `n`: The number of cities.
- `flights`: A list of flights. Each flight is represented as a tuple `(u, v, w)` where `u` is the starting city, `v` is the destination city, and `w` is the cost of the flight.
- `src`: The starting city.
- `dst`: The destination city.
- `k`: The maximum number of stops you are allowed to make.

**Output:**
- The cost of the cheapest flight from `src` to `dst` with at most `k` stops. If no such route exists, return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the cities have cycles?
2. Is it possible for multiple flights between two cities to exist?
3. Should we consider the price even if the number of stops exceeds `k`? (i.e., do we need exactly `k` stops or up to `k` stops?)
4. Can there be a flight from a city to itself?

Given that this is a typical graph problem and we need to find the shortest (cheapest) path with constraints on the number of edges (stops), the Bellman-Ford algorithm is quite suitable.

## Strategy

We will use a modified version of the Bellman-Ford algorithm:

1. **Initialization**: Create a cost array to store the minimum cost to reach each city.
2. **Relaxation**: Iterate up to `k+1` times (0 stops counts as one level of iteration). 

For each iteration, traverse all flights and update the costs of reaching destination cities from the starting cities if a cheaper route is found while ensuring that the stop constraint is not violated.

## Code

```javascript
function findCheapestPrice(n, flights, src, dst, k) {
    const MAX_COST = Infinity;
    let costs = Array(n).fill(MAX_COST);
    costs[src] = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i <= k; i++) {
        let tempCosts = [...costs];
        
        for (let [u, v, w] of flights) {
            if (costs[u] != MAX_COST) {
                tempCosts[v] = Math.min(tempCosts[v], costs[u] + w);
            }
        }
        
        costs = tempCosts;
    }
    
    return costs[dst] === MAX_COST ? -1 : costs[dst];
}

// Example Usage:
let n = 4
let flights = [[0, 1, 100], [1, 2, 100], [2, 3, 100], [0, 2, 500]]
let src = 0
let dst = 2
let k = 1
console.log(findCheapestPrice(n, flights, src, dst, k));  // Output: 200
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of the above approach is O((V + E) * k), where V is the number of vertices (cities) and E is the number of edges (flights). This is due to iterating `k + 1` times and traversing all flights in each iteration.
- **Space Complexity**: O(V), required for the `costs` array to store the minimum costs to reach each city.

This approach ensures that we find the cheapest flight path within the allowed number of stops.
