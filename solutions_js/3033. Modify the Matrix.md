[Leetcode 3033. Modify the Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3033)
**Problem Statement:**

You are given a matrix of integers and you need to write a function `modifyMatrix(matrix)` that transforms the matrix such that every element in the matrix becomes the sum of its adjacent elements in the original matrix. The adjacent elements are the ones directly above, below, to the left, and to the right of the current element. If an adjacent element is out of matrix range, it should be considered as `0`.

**Clarifying Questions:**

1. How should we handle the edges and corners of the matrix since they have fewer than 4 neighbors?
   - Elements out of matrix range should be considered as `0`.

2. How large can the matrix be? Is there a constraint on time or space complexity?
   - Assume the matrix size is reasonable to fit into memory and the emphasis is on getting the correct result efficiently.

3. Should we modify the matrix in place or return a new modified matrix?
   - Return a new modified matrix to avoid altering the input matrix during processing.

**Strategy:**

1. Create a new matrix `result` of the same dimensions as the input matrix.
2. Iterate through each element in the matrix.
3. For each element, calculate the sum of its adjacent elements considering out-of-bound fields as zeros.
4. Assign the calculated sum to the corresponding element in the `result` matrix.
5. Return the `result` matrix.

**Code:**

```javascript
function modifyMatrix(matrix) {
    const rows = matrix.length;
    const cols = matrix[0].length;
    const result = Array.from({ length: rows }, () => Array(cols).fill(0));

    for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            let sum = 0;
            
            // Sum the above element if it exists
            if (i - 1 >= 0) sum += matrix[i - 1][j];
            
            // Sum the below element if it exists
            if (i + 1 < rows) sum += matrix[i + 1][j];
            
            // Sum the left element if it exists
            if (j - 1 >= 0) sum += matrix[i][j - 1];
            
            // Sum the right element if it exists
            if (j + 1 < cols) sum += matrix[i][j + 1];
            
            result[i][j] = sum;
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

**Time Complexity:**
- The time complexity of this function is `O(n * m)`, where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns in the matrix. This is because we iterate over each element of the matrix once and calculate the sum of its adjacent elements in constant time.

**Space Complexity:**
- The space complexity is `O(n * m)` for the `result` matrix, where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns. We are allocating space for the new matrix which is the same size as the input matrix.
