[Leetcode 1774. Closest Dessert Cost](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1774)
### Problem Statement

You have `n` desserts offered with a `baseCost` array, where `baseCost[i]` represents the cost of the i-th dessert base. You also have `m` topping options in a `toppingCosts` array, where `toppingCosts[j]` represents the cost of the j-th type of topping. Each topping can be chosen either 0, 1, or 2 times. You want to make a dessert with the total cost as close as possible to the target value. You must use exactly one base cost but can use zero or more toppings.

Write a function `closestCost(baseCosts, toppingCosts, target)` that returns the closest possible cost of the dessert to the target.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can I assume all input arrays have lengths within reasonable limits (e.g., not exceedingly large)?**
   Yes, you can assume the lengths of `baseCosts` and `toppingCosts` are within typical problem constraints on LeetCode.

2. **Can the same topping be used more than twice?**
   No, each topping can be used at most twice.

3. **If multiple answers are equally close to the target, what should be returned?**
   You can return any of them, but usually, the smallest cost is preferred if multiple solutions are equally close.

### Strategy

1. **Recursive Approach with Memoization:**
   - Use a recursive approach to explore all possibilities by adding each topping 0, 1, or 2 times.
   - Start with each base cost and explore all topping combinations.
   - Use memoization to save already computed states to avoid redundant calculation.
   - Keep track of the closest cost to the target seen so far.

2. **Implementation Details:**
   - Implement a helper function to recursively calculate the possible costs.
   - For each base cost, calculate the dessert cost by adding toppings in all possible ways.
   - Compare and update the closest dessert cost to the target.

### Code

```javascript
var closestCost = function(baseCosts, toppingCosts, target) {
    let closestCost = Infinity;
    
    function dfs(currentCost, index) {
        const diff = Math.abs(target - currentCost);
        const closestDiff = Math.abs(target - closestCost);

        if (diff < closestDiff || (diff === closestDiff && currentCost < closestCost)) {
            closestCost = currentCost;
        }

        if (index >= toppingCosts.length || currentCost >= target) {
            return;
        }

        // No topping added
        dfs(currentCost, index + 1);
        // Add one topping of this type
        dfs(currentCost + toppingCosts[index], index + 1);
        // Add two toppings of this type
        dfs(currentCost + 2 * toppingCosts[index], index + 1);
    }

    for (let baseCost of baseCosts) {
        dfs(baseCost, 0);
    }

    return closestCost;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Base Costs Loop:** O(n) where `n` is the length of `baseCosts`.
- **DFS Function:** Each topping can be added in 3 different ways (0, 1, or 2 times). If there are `m` toppings, the time complexity is O(3^m) in the worst case per base cost.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n * 3^m)**. This exponential complexity suggests that the solution will be efficient for moderate values of `m`. 

### Space Complexity

- The space complexity primarily involves the call stack for recursive function calls. In the worst case, this is O(m) which corresponds to the depth of the recursion tree. Thus, the overall space complexity is **O(m)**.
