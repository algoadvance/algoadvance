[Leetcode 1700. Number of Students Unable to Eat Lunch](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1700)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays `students` and `sandwiches` where `students[i]` is the type of student i's favorite sandwich, and `sandwiches[j]` is the type of sandwich at the j-th position in the stack (i.e., the j-th sandwich is prepared first).

* `students` and `sandwiches` have the same length.
* Each student prefers one type of sandwich and there are only two types of sandwiches: 0 (circular) and 1 (square).
* If the student at the front of the line prefers the sandwich on the top of the stack, they will take it and leave the queue.
* Otherwise, they will move to the end of the line and the next student in the queue will look at the stack.
* This continues until none of the students want to take the sandwich that's on the top of the stack.

You need to return the number of students that are unable to eat.

#### Example:
```plaintext
Input: students = [1,1,0,0], sandwiches = [0,1,0,1]
Output: 0

Input: students = [1,1,1,0,0,1], sandwiches = [1,0,0,0,1,1]
Output: 3
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Do we need to account for invalid inputs (e.g., students and sandwiches of different lengths)? 
   - Assume inputs are valid and of the same length as per the problem statement.
2. Are there any restrictions on the length of the arrays?
   - No explicit length restrictions, but they can be assumed to fit typical memory constraints for such problems.
3. Can we use additional data structures (e.g., queues, stacks)?
   - Yes, you can use additional data structures as needed.

### Strategy

1. We will use two counters to track the number of each type of sandwich and the number of students who prefer each type of sandwich.
2. We'll iterate through the sandwiches. For each sandwich on top, we check if there are students who prefer that type:
   - If there are, we decrement the count for that type of student.
   - If there are none left for that type, we stop and return the total number of remaining students.
3. The algorithm iterates over the sandwiches while checking and updating the students' preferences efficiently.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution will be O(n) where `n` is the number of students (or sandwiches) because we iterate through the lists in a linear fashion.

### Code

Here is a straightforward implementation of the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function countStudents(students, sandwiches) {
    let countZero = students.filter(s => s === 0).length;
    let countOne = students.length - countZero;
  
    for (let i = 0; i < sandwiches.length; i++) {
        if (sandwiches[i] === 0) {
            if (countZero > 0) {
                countZero--;
            } else {
                return sandwiches.length - i;
            }
        } else {
            if (countOne > 0) {
                countOne--;
            } else {
                return sandwiches.length - i;
            }
        }
    }
  
    return 0;
}

// Examples
console.log(countStudents([1, 1, 0, 0], [0, 1, 0, 1])); // Output: 0
console.log(countStudents([1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], [1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1])); // Output: 3
```

This solution calculates the remaining number of students who cannot get their preferred sandwich in a linear pass through the sandwich stack.
