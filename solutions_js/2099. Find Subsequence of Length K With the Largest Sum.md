[Leetcode 2099. Find Subsequence of Length K With the Largest Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2099)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You want to find a subsequence of `nums` of length `k` that has the largest sum.

Return **any** such subsequence as an integer array of length `k`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What are the constraints on the input values?**
    - The size of the array `nums` will be at least `k`.
    - The elements of the array can be negative, zero, or positive.

2. **Is there a single unique subsequence that satisfies the conditions?**
    - No, there can be multiple valid subsequences. Any valid output will be acceptable.

3. **Should the relative order of the elements in the subsequence be the same as in the original array?**
    - Yes, the relative order should be maintained.

## Strategy
1. **Identify the Top K Elements by Value**
    - First, we find the `k` largest elements in `nums`.

2. **Maintain Their Relative Order**
    - To maintain the relative order, we can use the positions of these elements in the original array when forming the subsequence.

3. **Detailed Steps**
    - Create a list of tuples where each tuple consists of an element in `nums` and its index.
    - Sort this list by the element values in descending order.
    - Select the first `k` tuples from the sorted list.
    - Sort these selected tuples by their original indices.
    - Extract the elements from these tuples to form the final subsequence.

## Code

```javascript
function maxSubsequence(nums, k) {
    // Step 1: Combine the elements with their original indices
    let indexedNums = nums.map((num, index) => [num, index]);
    
    // Step 2: Sort the list based on the values in descending order
    indexedNums.sort((a, b) => b[0] - a[0]);
    
    // Step 3: Select the top k elements
    let topK = indexedNums.slice(0, k);
    
    // Step 4: Sort the top k elements based on their original indices
    topK.sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1]);
    
    // Step 5: Extract the elements of the subsequence
    let result = topK.map(item => item[0]);
    
    return result;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(maxSubsequence([2,1,3,3], 2)); // Output could be [3, 3]
console.log(maxSubsequence([-1,-2,3,4], 3)); // Output could be [-1, 3, 4]
```

## Time Complexity
- **Mapping and Initial Tuple Creation**: O(n)
- **Sorting by Value**: O(n log n)
- **Slicing to Get Top `k` Elements**: O(k)
- **Sorting by Original Indices**: O(k log k)
- **Final Mapping to Form Result**: O(k)

Overall, the most significant steps are the sorting operations, making the total complexity **O(n log n)**.

This strategy ensures we get a valid subsequence of length `k` with the largest possible sum while maintaining the order of elements as they appear in the original array.
