[Leetcode 3200. Maximum Height of a Triangle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3200)
### Problem Statement

You are given three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c`. Your task is to determine the maximum height of a triangle that can be formed with a base `b` and two sides `a` and `c`.

### Clarifying Questions

Before jumping into the solution, I will clarify a few things:

1. **Is `a` guaranteed to be one of the sides or can it be the base?**  
   - If not explicitly stated, assume the sides `a` and `c` are such that they are not the base.

2. **Can the sides and base take any positive integer values, or are there any constraints?**  
   - Assume the sides and base can be any positive integer.

3. **Should the triangle follow the normal properties of a triangle (i.e., sum of any two sides greater than the third side)?**  
   - Yes, a valid triangle must satisfy the triangle inequality condition.

### Strategy

To determine the maximum height of the triangle:
1. **Triangle Properties**: Ensure the sides fulfill the triangle inequality condition:
    - `a + b > c`
    - `a + c > b`
    - `b + c > a`
    
2. **Height Calculation**: Using the formula for the area of a triangle and the Pythagorean theorem:
    - The area can be computed using Heron's formula:
      - \( s = \frac{a + b + c}{2} \) (semiperimeter)
      - \( \text{Area} = \sqrt{s \times (s - a) \times (s - b) \times (s - c)} \)
    - The height `h` relative to the base `b` is:
      - \( h = \frac{2 \times \text{Area}}{b} \)

### Code

Here's how you might implement this in JavaScript:

```javascript
function maximumHeight(a, b, c) {
    function isValidTriangle(a, b, c) {
        return (a + b > c) && (a + c > b) && (b + c > a);
    }

    if (!isValidTriangle(a, b, c)) {
        return 0; // Not a valid triangle
    }

    // Calculate semiperimeter
    let s = (a + b + c) / 2;

    // Calculate area using Heron's formula
    let area = Math.sqrt(s * (s - a) * (s - b) * (s - c));

    // Calculate the height relative to the base `b`
    let height = (2 * area) / b;

    return height;
}

// Example usage:
let a = 5, b = 6, c = 7;
console.log(maximumHeight(a, b, c)); // Should print the possible maximum height
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because:
- The calculations—addition, subtraction, and square root—do not depend on the size of the input.
- Even though we are performing multiple arithmetic operations, the count of these operations remains constant regardless of the input values.

This solution leverages straightforward arithmetic and basic geometric principles to achieve constant time complexity.
