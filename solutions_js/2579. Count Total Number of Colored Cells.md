[Leetcode 2579. Count Total Number of Colored Cells](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2579)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n`, representing the number of stages in a process where cells are being colored. Every stage adds colored cells such that the entire structure grows in a specific pattern. Initially, at stage 1, there is just 1 colored cell. The task is to find out the total number of colored cells at the `n-th` stage.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Pattern Clarification**: Could you clarify how the cells are added at each stage? 
   - Do the cells form a specific geometric shape (like a square, triangle, etc.)?
   
2. **Output Type**: Should the function return the total number of colored cells as an integer?
   
3. **Constraints**: What are the possible values for `n`? Minimum and maximum values would be helpful.

### Strategy

Upon clarification, assuming that the pattern for adding cells is not immediately obvious and focusing on general recursive or mathematical series, a reasonable next step is to derive a pattern from given examples of stages.

We can deduce:
- **Stage 1**: 1 cell
- **Stage 2**: Add cells such that it becomes a specific shape (say cross shaped)
- **Stage 3**: Add cells again. 

A common pattern for growth involves arithmetic series or geometric series. In many grid problems, growth can also be quadratic.

Let's assume a pattern where each stage's growth can be derived mathematically in a simple way using quadratic relation. We can start deriving a formula and use it in our function.

### Code

Hereâ€™s a general idea of how you might implement such a function if it's quadratic:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var coloredCells = function(n) {
    // Presuming the number of cells follows a specific pattern like n^2 or similar.
    // Example formula: If it grows like an expanded 'X' or '+' each new stage adds (4 * n - 4) cells
    if (n === 1) return 1;
    
    return (2 * n - 1) * (2 * n - 1); // Assuming quadratic growth centered around the initial cell
};

// Example usage:
console.log(coloredCells(1)); // Output: 1
console.log(coloredCells(2)); // Output depends on pattern, e.g., 5 if it follows cross shape
console.log(coloredCells(3)); // Output depends on pattern, e.g., 13 if follows same pattern
```

### Explanation:

1. **Base Case**: If `n` is 1, return 1 because there is only one colored cell at stage 1.
2. **Formula Calculation**:
   - Assuming a quadratic relation where each stage forms a grid growing continually around the initial center cell.
   - For example, at `n`, assuming a grid-like structure, the formula `(2n - 1)^2` calculates the total number of colored cells.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(1)\), because we are calculating the result using a direct formula.
  
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\), because no extra space is being used apart from the input and output.

Note: This solution assumes a specific pattern derived hypothetically. The exact pattern might vary based on additional details provided in the problem statement.
