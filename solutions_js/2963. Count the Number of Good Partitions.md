[Leetcode 2963. Count the Number of Good Partitions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2963)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. A partition of `nums` is considered "good" if it can be split into exactly `k` non-overlapping subarrays, such that the sum of each subarray is equal. 

You need to return the number of "good" partitions of `nums`.

**Example:**
```
Input: nums = [2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2], k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: The arrays can be partitioned into subsets as (2, 1, 3), (2, 3, 4), (1, 2) and (2), (1, 3, 2, 3, 4), (1, 2).
Both of the given partitions are valid as each subset has equal sum in both the partitions.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. Does the order of elements in the `nums` need to remain the same in the subarrays?
2. What is the range of input values for `nums` and `k`?
3. Are negative numbers allowed in the `nums` array?
4. Do we need to handle the case where `nums` cannot be divided into k parts at all, or should we assume all inputs given are valid?

### Strategy
1. **Total Sum Calculation**: First, compute the total sum of the array.
2. **Feasibility Check**: Check if the total sum is divisible by `k`. If not, return 0 immediately.
3. **Partition Sum**: Calculate the required sum for each partition by dividing the total sum by `k`.
4. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
    - Use a recursive dynamic programming approach to explore different partitions.
    - Track the current index, remaining partitions and current partition sum.
    - Use memoization to store results of sub-problems to avoid recomputation.

### Code
Here's the JavaScript code to solve the problem using dynamic programming and memoization.

```javascript
var countPartitions = function(nums, k) {
    let totalSum = nums.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
    if (totalSum % k !== 0) return 0;
    
    let partitionSum = totalSum / k;
    let memo = new Map();
    
    function dfs(index, currentSum, partitionsCount) {
        if (partitionsCount === k) return 1;
        if (currentSum > partitionSum) return 0;
        if (index >= nums.length) return 0;
        
        let key = `${index}-${currentSum}-${partitionsCount}`;
        if (memo.has(key)) return memo.get(key);
      
        // Include current number in the current partition
        let include = dfs(index + 1, currentSum + nums[index], partitionsCount);
        
        // Start a new partition with the current number if currentSum == partitionSum
        let newPartition = 0;
        if (currentSum === partitionSum) {
            newPartition = dfs(index + 1, nums[index], partitionsCount + 1);
        }
        
        memo.set(key, include + newPartition);
        return include + newPartition;
    }
    
    return dfs(0, 0, 0);
}

// Example usage:
let nums = [2, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2];
let k = 3;
console.log(countPartitions(nums, k)); // Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this approach is O(n * partitionSum * k), where `n` is the length of `nums`, as we explore each index with different possible current sums and partition counts, while using memoization to speed up the process.
- The space complexity is O(n * partitionSum * k) due to the recursive stack and memoization storage.
