[Leetcode 2217. Find Palindrome With Fixed Length](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2217)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `queries` and a positive integer `intLength`. You have to return an array `answer` where `answer[i]` is the `queries[i]`th palindrome of the length `intLength` in the range of positive integers.

For instance, if `queries[i]` is 1 and `intLength` is 3, the answer should return the first 3-digit palindrome number (i.e., 101).

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are `queries` guaranteed to be within the range that ensures there exists a `queries[i]`th palindrome of the length `intLength`?
   - Assume `queries` contain only valid values that correspond to existing palindromes of the given length.

2. Will the palindrome be only numeric?
   - Yes, palindromes here are strictly numeric.

3. Are there any constraints on the length of `queries` or the size of `intLength`?
   - The constraints generally will be reasonable within the scope of typical integer handling in JavaScript.

### Strategy

1. **Palindrome Construction**: A numeric palindrome can be constructed by mirroring its half. For example, a 5-digit palindrome can be formed by mirroring the first 3 digits.
2. **Index Calculation**: Convert the index from the `queries` into the first half of the palindrome. Specifically, the first few digits of the palindrome can be adjusted with the index.
3. **Edge Cases**:
   - 1-digit palindromes are straightforward.
   - For even and odd lengths, handles need to be different due to how mirroring occurs.

### Code

```javascript
function findPalindrome(queries, intLength) {
    function createPalindrome(base, isOdd) {
        const baseStr = base.toString();
        const reversed = baseStr.split('').reverse().join('');
        // Exclude the last digit of baseStr in case of odd length
        return parseInt(baseStr + reversed.slice(isOdd ? 1 : 0));
    }
    
    const halfLength = Math.floor((intLength + 1) / 2);
    const start = 10 ** (halfLength - 1);
    const end = 10 ** halfLength - 1;
    const results = [];
    
    for (const query of queries) {
        const number = start + query - 1;
        if (number > end) {
            results.push(-1);
        } else {
            const palindrome = createPalindrome(number, intLength % 2 !== 0);
            results.push(palindrome);
        }
    }
    
    return results;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Palindrome Construction**: O(d), where d is the number of digits in `intLength` (O(log k) for k being the range of numbers that fit in `intLength` digits).
- **Overall Complexity**: O(n * d) where n is the number of queries. This is efficient and should be reasonable for most inputs.

### Explanation

1. **createPalindrome**: This function creates a full palindrome by mirroring the portion of the number determined by half its length.
2. The processing loop calculates the base number by adjusting with the `query`.
3. If the base number exceeds the allowed range, return -1.
4. Convert the number to a palindrome and store it in the results.

This approach effectively constructs palindromes by leveraging positional properties of numbers and ensures efficient computation within specified constraints.
