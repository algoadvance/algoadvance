[Leetcode 1695. Maximum Erasure Value](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1695)
### Problem Statement:
You are given an array of positive integers `nums` and want to erase a subarray containing **unique elements**. The **score** you get by erasing the subarray is equal to the **sum** of its elements.

Return the **maximum score** you can get by erasing exactly one subarray.

A subarray is a contiguous part of the array.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can the array contain duplicate elements? 
   - Yes, the problem explicitly mentions finding a subarray with unique elements.
2. How large can the array be?
   - The constraints indicate that `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5` and `1 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`, so we need an efficient solution.

### Strategy:
We'll use the sliding window technique along with a set to keep track of unique elements within the current window:

1. **Initialize a set** to store unique elements in the current window.
2. **Initialize pointers** for the window's start (`left`) and end (`right`).
3. **Initialize variables** to keep track of the current sum (`currentSum`) of the window and the maximum sum (`maxSum`) found.
4. Move the `right` pointer to expand the window:
    - If the element at `nums[right]` is not in the set, add it to the set and update the `currentSum`.
    - If the element at `nums[right]` is already in the set, move the `left` pointer to the right until the element can be removed from the set and re-added.
5. After adjusting, update the `maxSum` if the current window's sum is greater.
6. Repeat until the `right` pointer reaches the end of the array.

### Code:
Here is the JavaScript implementation of the above strategy:

```javascript
function maximumUniqueSubarray(nums) {
    let left = 0;
    let currentSum = 0;
    let maxSum = 0;
    const uniqueElements = new Set();

    for (let right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
        // Adjust the window to maintain unique elements
        while (uniqueElements.has(nums[right])) {
            uniqueElements.delete(nums[left]);
            currentSum -= nums[left];
            left++;
        }
        
        uniqueElements.add(nums[right]);
        currentSum += nums[right];
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);
    }

    return maxSum;
}
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the input array. Each element is added and removed from the set at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(min(n, m)), where `m` is the range of input numbers (`10^4`). The set space depends on the number of unique elements within the current sliding window.

This solution ensures we process the array efficiently while maintaining and updating unique elements and their corresponding sums dynamically.
