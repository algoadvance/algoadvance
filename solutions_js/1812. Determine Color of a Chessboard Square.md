[Leetcode 1812. Determine Color of a Chessboard Square](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1812)
## Problem Statement

You are given a coordinate `coordinates` that represents the coordinates of a square on a chessboard. For example, `a1` represents the square at column 'a' and row '1'. 

Return `true` if the square is white, and `false` if the square is black.

The chessboard is arranged in such a way that:

- Column 'a', 'c', 'e', 'g' should start with a black square
- Column 'b', 'd', 'f', 'h' should start with a white square

## Clarifying Questions

1. What are the possible values of the inputs?
   - The input will always be valid and will contain a string of length 2 where the first character is in the range 'a' to 'h' and the second character is in the range '1' to '8'.

2. Is the chessboard 1-indexed or 0-indexed?
   - The chessboard uses 1-indexing.

## Strategy

1. Decode the column and row numbers from given coordinates.
   - Convert the column letter to its respective number where 'a' = 1, 'b' = 2, ..., 'h' = 8.
   - Convert the row character directly to an integer.

2. Determine the color of the square:
   - Calculate the sum of the column number and row number.
   - If the sum is even, the square is black; if the sum is odd, the square is white.

## Code

```javascript
function squareIsWhite(coordinates) {
  const column = coordinates.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0) + 1;
  const row = parseInt(coordinates[1]);
  
  // Calculate the sum of the column and row
  const sum = column + row;
  
  // Determine the color based on the sum
  return sum % 2 === 1;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(squareIsWhite("a1")); // false (black)
console.log(squareIsWhite("h3")); // true (white)
console.log(squareIsWhite("c7")); // false (black)
console.log(squareIsWhite("d2")); // true (white)
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because we are performing a constant number of operations regardless of the input size.
- Space complexity is also O(1) since we are using only a fixed amount of extra space.

This approach ensures that we can efficiently determine the color of any given square on the chessboard.
