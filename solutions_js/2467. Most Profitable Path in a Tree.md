[Leetcode 2467. Most Profitable Path in a Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2467)
### Problem Statement

You are given a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph with no cycles) consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and exactly `n - 1` edges. The root of the tree is node `0`, and each node of the tree has a demand value given in the integer array `demand`, where `demand[i]` is the demand value for node `i`.

You need to find the most profitable path in the tree starting from the root node `0`. A profitable path is a path in the tree that collects the maximum demand values.

Return the nodes in the most profitable path in the order they appear in the path.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the demand values guaranteed to be non-negative?
2. Can there be multiple paths with the same maximum profit? If yes, do we return any one of them?
3. What are the constraints on the number of nodes `n`?

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number[][]} edges
 * @param {number[]} demand
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var mostProfitablePath = function(n, edges, demand) {
    // Build the adjacency list for the tree
    const graph = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
    
    for (const [u, v] of edges) {
        graph[u].push(v);
        graph[v].push(u);
    }

    // Initialize variables to keep track of the maximum profit and the most profitable path
    let maxProfit = -Infinity;
    let mostProfitablePath = [];

    // Helper function to perform DFS and find the most profitable path
    const dfs = (node, parent, path, currentProfit) => {
        currentProfit += demand[node];
        path.push(node);

        // If it's a leaf node, check if the current path is the most profitable
        if (graph[node].length === 1 && node !== 0) {
            if (currentProfit > maxProfit) {
                maxProfit = currentProfit;
                mostProfitablePath = [...path];
            }
        } else { // Otherwise, continue to traverse the tree
            for (const neighbor of graph[node]) {
                if (neighbor !== parent) {
                    dfs(neighbor, node, path, currentProfit);
                }
            }
        }

        // Backtrack
        path.pop();
    };

    // Start DFS from the root node
    dfs(0, -1, [], 0);

    return mostProfitablePath;
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Graph Construction**: Use an adjacency list to represent the tree.
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Perform DFS starting from the root node:
   - Track the current path and its profit.
   - Upon reaching a leaf node, compare the current path's profit with the maximum profit recorded so far.
   - If the current profit is higher, update the maximum profit and record the current path.
3. **Backtracking**: Ensure the path is properly tracked using the DFS algorithm and backtracked to explore all possible paths.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - Each node and edge is visited exactly once in the DFS traversal.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - For the adjacency list representation of the graph.
  - For the recursive call stack in DFS and the path storage.
