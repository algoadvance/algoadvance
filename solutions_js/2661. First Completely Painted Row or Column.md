[Leetcode 2661. First Completely Painted Row or Column](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2661)
## Problem Statement
You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `mat` and an integer array `arr` of size `m*n` which consists of distinct integers from `1` to `m*n`.

You need to reorder the matrix such that the array `arr` contains the order of elements from the matrix after reordering.

Find the first completely painted row or column after reordering the elements in `arr`.

A row or column is said to be completely painted if all the elements in that row or column become `0`.

Return the index of the first painted row or column. Return `-1` if no row or column becomes completely painted.

### Example

```plaintext
Input: mat = [[1,2,3],
              [4,5,6],
              [7,8,9]], 
        arr = [3,5,7,2,6,8,1,4,9]
  
Output: 2

Explanation: 
We start by reordering the matrix `mat`.

In first iteration, arr[0] = 3, so 3 becomes 0.
In second iteration, arr[1] = 5, so 5 becomes 0.
In third iteration, arr[2] = 7, so 7 becomes 0.
After third iteration, first column becomes zero i.e [1,4,7] => [1,4,0] => [1,0,0] => [0,0,0] so the answer is 2.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can the size of `mat` and `arr` be guaranteed to be such that `arr` has precisely `m*n` unique elements?
2. Are we guaranteed that each element of `arr` exactly matches an element in `mat` (1 to `m*n`)?
3. Would the input array `arr` always contain the valid elements within range `1` to `m*n`?

## Strategy
1. Create a map to store the positions of each number in the matrix `mat`.
2. Track the number of elements painted in each row and each column.
3. Iterate through `arr`, find the position of the current element in the matrix, mark it as painted, and increment the painted count for the corresponding row and column.
4. Check if any row or column is completely painted after each iteration and return its index (0-based) when it happens for the first time.
5. If no row or column is completely painted, return `-1`.

## Code

```javascript
function firstCompletelyPainted(mat, arr) {
    const m = mat.length;
    const n = mat[0].length;
    
    const positionMap = {};
    // Create a position map for quick lookup
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            positionMap[mat[i][j]] = [i, j];
        }
    }

    const rowPaintCount = Array(m).fill(0);
    const colPaintCount = Array(n).fill(0);
    
    for (let k = 0; k < arr.length; k++) {
        const [row, col] = positionMap[arr[k]];
        rowPaintCount[row]++;
        colPaintCount[col]++;
        
        if (rowPaintCount[row] === n) return row;  // All columns in this row are painted
        if (colPaintCount[col] === m) return col;  // All rows in this column are painted
    }

    return -1;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(m * n), since we are iterating through all elements of `mat` to create the `positionMap`, and iterating through `arr` which contains `m * n` elements.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m * n) for storing the `positionMap`, `rowPaintCount`, and `colPaintCount`.

This approach ensures efficient lookup and count checks leading to an accurate determination of the first completely painted row or column.
