[Leetcode 1377. Frog Position After T Seconds](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1377)
### Problem Statement

Given an undirected tree consisting of `n` vertices numbered from `1` to `n`, a frog starts jumping from vertex `1`. Each second, the frog jumps to an adjacent vertex. If the frog has multiple choices, it chooses one uniformly at random.

The tree is represented by a list of edges `edges`, where `edges[i] = [u, v]` means there is an edge between vertices `u` and `v`. 

Given the tree, the number of seconds `t`, and the target vertex `target`, return the probability that the frog is on the target vertex after `t` seconds. If the frog cannot reach the target vertex, return 0.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the tree connected?**
   - Yes, the nature of a tree ensures that all vertices are connected.

2. **Can `t` be 0?**
   - Yes, if `t` is 0, the frog has not yet jumped and is at the starting vertex.

3. **Are parallel edges or loops considered?**
   - No, since it is given as a tree, there are no parallel edges or loops.

### Strategy

1. **Build the Tree:**
   - Use an adjacency list to represent the tree.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - Utilize BFS to simulate the frog's movements.
   - Keep track of the probabilities as you explore the tree.

3. **Probability Updates:**
   - At each vertex during BFS, evenly distribute the current probability to all adjacent vertices.
   - Stop exploring further if `t` is 0 or if the frog has no place to move (meaning it would stay at a leaf node).

4. **Check End Conditions:**
   - If after `t` seconds the BFS reaches the `target`, return the probability.
   - If not reachable within `t` seconds, return 0.

### Code

```javascript
function frogPosition(n, edges, t, target) {
    // Create adjacency list
    const graph = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () => []);
    for (let [u, v] of edges) {
        graph[u].push(v);
        graph[v].push(u);
    }
    
    // BFS with each node keeping probability
    const queue = [[1, 1]]; // [vertex, probability]
    const visited = new Array(n + 1).fill(false);
    visited[1] = true;
    
    while (queue.length && t >= 0) {
        const size = queue.length;
        for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            const [node, prob] = queue.shift();
            
            // If we have reached the target and no more seconds left, return probability
            if (t === 0) {
                if (node === target) return prob;
            } else {
                const neighbors = graph[node].filter(neighbor => !visited[neighbor]);
                const numOfUnvisited = neighbors.length;

                for (let neighbor of neighbors) {
                    visited[neighbor] = true;
                    queue.push([neighbor, prob / numOfUnvisited]);
                }

                if (numOfUnvisited === 0 && node === target) {
                    return prob;
                } else if (numOfUnvisited === 0) {
                    // Means frog stayed at a leaf node
                    continue;
                }
            }
        }
        t--;
    }
    
    return 0;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Building the Tree:**
   - O(n) to create the adjacency list from given edges.

2. **BFS Traversal:**
   - O(n) to traverse the tree using BFS.

**Total: O(n)**

The provided solution builds the tree and performs BFS traversal efficiently within O(n) complexity considering the constraints of the problem. This ensures a prompt result even for the upper limit of vertex count.
