[Leetcode 662. Maximum Width of Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l662)
## Problem Statement
Given the `root` of a binary tree, return the **maximum width** of the given tree. The maximum width of a tree is the maximum width among all levels. The width of one level is defined as the length between the end-nodes (the leftmost and rightmost non-null nodes), where the null nodes between the end-nodes are also counted into the length calculation.

It is guaranteed that the answer will in the range of a 32-bit signed integer.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: root = [1,3,2,5,3,null,9]
Output: 4
Explanation: The maximum width exists in the third level with length 4 (5,3,null,9).
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: root = [1,3,2,5,null,null,9,6,null,7]
Output: 7
Explanation: The maximum width exists in the fourth level with length 7 (6,null,null,null,null,null,7).
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: root = [1,3,2,5]
Output: 2
Explanation: The maximum width exists in the second level with length 2 (3,2).
```

## Clarifying Questions
- Should the solution handle large trees efficiently? (Yes, usage of breadth-first search might be useful to ensure performance).

## Strategy
We need to perform a level-order traversal (BFS). While traversing, we track the position of each node. The width of each level is the difference between the maximum and minimum positions plus one.

### Steps:
1. Initialize a queue with the root node and its position (use a starting position of 1).
2. Traverse the tree level by level.
3. For each level, determine the width by comparing the leftmost and rightmost positions.
4. Update the maximum width if the current level's width is larger.
5. Return the maximum width after traversing all levels.

## Code
```javascript
function widthOfBinaryTree(root) {
    if (!root) return 0;

    let maxWidth = 0;
    const queue = [{ node: root, pos: 1 }];

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const levelLength = queue.length;
        let minPos = Infinity, maxPos = -Infinity;

        for (let i = 0; i < levelLength; i++) {
            const { node, pos } = queue.shift();

            minPos = Math.min(minPos, pos);
            maxPos = Math.max(maxPos, pos);

            if (node.left) {
                queue.push({ node: node.left, pos: pos * 2 });
            }
            if (node.right) {
                queue.push({ node: node.right, pos: pos * 2 + 1 });
            }
        }

        maxWidth = Math.max(maxWidth, maxPos - minPos + 1);
    }

    return maxWidth;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree, as we visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), since in the worst case, we might store all nodes at the deepest level in the queue.

This solution ensures we efficiently traverse the tree and calculate the maximum width.
