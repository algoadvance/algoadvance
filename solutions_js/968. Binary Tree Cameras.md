[Leetcode 968. Binary Tree Cameras](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l968)
### Problem Statement

You are given the `root` of a binary tree. We install cameras on the tree nodes where each camera at a node can monitor its parent, itself, and its immediate children. 

Return the minimum number of cameras needed to monitor all nodes of the tree.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the values of nodes important?**
   - No, the values of nodes are not important for positioning the cameras, only the structure of the tree matters.
   
2. **Can the input tree be NULL or empty?**
   - Yes, if the input tree is `null`, the minimum number of cameras needed would be `0`.

3. **Is the binary tree guaranteed to be a full binary tree or could it be any shape?**
   - It can be any shape, not necessarily a full binary tree.

### Strategy

We will use a Depth-First Search (DFS) strategy to systematically place our cameras. There are three states we need to consider for each node:
1. **Covered without a camera**: Node is monitored by a child or parent.
2. **Covered with a camera**: Node has a camera.
3. **Needs coverage**: Node needs monitoring.

By solving this recursively for each child, we balance the placement of cameras to ensure every node is monitored with the minimum number of cameras. Here is a step-by-step plan:

1. Use a helper function with DFS to traverse the tree.
2. For each node, determine if it is in one of the three states mentioned.
3. Keep count of the cameras placed.
4. Post-order process each node, i.e., solve for the left and right children before the parent.

### Code

```javascript
class TreeNode {
  constructor(val = 0, left = null, right = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
  }
}

var minCameraCover = function (root) {
  let cameras = 0;

  // States: -1 -> Needs Coverage, 0 -> Covered, 1 -> Camera is placed here
  const dfs = (node) => {
    if (node === null) return 0;
    
    const left = dfs(node.left);
    const right = dfs(node.right);

    // If either child needs coverage, place camera here
    if (left === -1 || right === -1) {
      cameras++;
      return 1;
    }

    // If either child has a camera, this node is covered
    if (left === 1 || right === 1) return 0;

    // Otherwise, this node needs coverage
    return -1;
  };

  // If after checking the root still needs coverage, place a camera at the root
  if (dfs(root) === -1) cameras++;

  return cameras;
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(N)**, where **N** is the number of nodes in the binary tree. This is because each node is visited once during the DFS traversal.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is **O(H)**, where **H** is the height of the tree, due to the recursive call stack. In the worst case, this could be **O(N)** if the tree is skewed, but on average for a balanced tree, it would be **O(log N)**.
