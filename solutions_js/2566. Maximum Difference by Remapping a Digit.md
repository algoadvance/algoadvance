[Leetcode 2566. Maximum Difference by Remapping a Digit](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2566)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer `num`, you need to find the maximum difference you can get by changing the digits of `num`. You are allowed to remap exactly one digit to any other digit (0-9 inclusive) and apply the remapping on all occurrences of that digit in `num`. Note that the new number cannot have leading zeros. Return the maximum difference of the new numbers you can get.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: What is the range of the input number?**
   - A: The problem does not specify, but we can assume typical constraints for integer inputs in competitive programming, such as `0 <= num <= 10^9`.

2. **Q: Can `num` have leading zeros?**
   - A: No, `num` itself cannot have leading zeros (except for the number 0).

3. **Q: Is it mandatory to change at least one digit?**
   - A: No, it is not mandatory, but the goal is to find the maximum difference, so a change might be necessary to achieve that.

### Strategy
1. **Identify Possible Changes:**
    - We can remap each digit from `0-9` to any other digit.
    - We need to calculate two extreme numbers: the maximum possible number after remapping and the minimum possible number after remapping.

2. **Calculate the Maximum Number:**
    - To get the maximum number, we should try to remap lower digits in `num` to the highest digit `9`.

3. **Calculate the Minimum Number:**
    - To get the minimum number, we should try to remap higher digits in `num` to the lowest digit `0`.

4. **Avoid Leading Zeros:**
    - Ensure that any changes do not result in leading zeros.

5. **Determine the Maximum Difference:**
    - The difference between the maximum and minimum numbers derived from the remapping.

### Code

```javascript
function maxDiff(num) {
    const numStr = num.toString();
    
    // Helper function to replace digits
    const replaceDigits = (str, fromDigit, toDigit) => {
        if (fromDigit === toDigit) return str;
        return str.split('').map(char => (char === fromDigit ? toDigit : char)).join('');
    }
    
    // Calculate the maximum number
    let maxNum = num;
    for (let digit of numStr) {
        if (digit !== '9') {
            const changedNum = parseInt(replaceDigits(numStr, digit, '9'));
            maxNum = Math.max(maxNum, changedNum);
        }
    }

    // Calculate the minimum number
    // For the first digit, it shouldn't be replaced by '0'
    let minNum = num;
    for (let digit of numStr) {
        if (digit !== '0' && digit !== numStr[0]) {
            const changedNum = parseInt(replaceDigits(numStr, digit, '0'));
            minNum = Math.min(minNum, changedNum);
        } else if (digit === numStr[0] && numStr[0] !== '1') {
            const changedNum = parseInt(replaceDigits(numStr, numStr[0], '1'));
            minNum = Math.min(minNum, changedNum);
        }
    }
    
    return maxNum - minNum;
}

// Example test case
console.log(maxDiff(555)); // Output would be 888 (999 - 111)
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of digits in `num`.
  - This is because, for each digit, we make transformations and check the result.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) for the storage of the transformed number in string format.

This solution iterates through the digits of the number a few times, ensuring we maximize and minimize the number by appropriate replacements, and hence provides the desired maximum difference efficiently.
