[Leetcode 1004. Max Consecutive Ones III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1004)
## Problem Statement
Given a binary array `nums` and an integer `k`, you can flip at most `k` `0`s to `1`s. Return the length of the longest (contiguous) subarray that contains only `1`s after flipping at most `k` `0`s.

**Example**:
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: 
[1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1]
        |---------|
        
Input: nums = [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], k = 3
Output: 9
Explanation: 
[0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
```

**Constraints**:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- nums[i] is `0` or `1`
- 0 <= k <= nums.length

## Clarifying Questions
1. Is the array predominantly filled with `1`s or `0`s or does it vary?
2. Will there always be at least one `1` in the array?
3. Can `k` be equal to the entire length of the array?

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var longestOnes = function(nums, k) {
    // Initialize pointers and the count of zeros in the window
    let left = 0, right = 0, zeroCount = 0;
    let maxLength = 0;

    // Iterate over the array with the right pointer
    for (right = 0; right < nums.length; right++) {
        // If we see a zero, increase the zeroCount
        if (nums[right] === 0) {
            zeroCount++;
        }
        
        // While the zeroCount is more than k, move the left pointer to reduce the zeroCount
        while (zeroCount > k) {
            if (nums[left] === 0) {
                zeroCount--;
            }
            left++;
        }
        
        // Update the maxLength
        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, right - left + 1);
    }
    
    return maxLength;
};

// Test cases
console.log(longestOnes([1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1], 2)); // Output: 6
console.log(longestOnes([0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1], 3)); // Output: 9
console.log(longestOnes([1, 0, 1, 0, 1, 0, 1], 2));             // Output: 5
console.log(longestOnes([1, 1, 1, 1], 0));                      // Output: 4
```

## Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the sliding window technique:
1. Initialize two pointers `left` and `right` to represent the window.
2. Use a counter to keep track of the number of zeros in the current window.
3. Expand the window by increasing the `right` pointer.
4. If the zero count exceeds `k`, shrink the window from the left until the zero count is within the limit.
5. The maximum window length encountered during this process will be our desired result.

This approach ensures that we scan through the array once, making it efficient.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity is `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the array. This is because both the `left` and `right` pointers traverse the array at most once.

Space complexity would be `O(1)` since we're using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
