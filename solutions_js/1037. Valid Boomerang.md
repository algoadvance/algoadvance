[Leetcode 1037. Valid Boomerang](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1037)
### Problem Statement

A boomerang is a set of three points that are all distinct and not in a straight line. Given a list of three points in the plane, return whether these points are a boomerang.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: points = [[1,1],[2,3],[3,2]]
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: points = [[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]]
Output: false
```

**Constraints:**
- `points.length == 3`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `0 <= points[i][j] <= 100`

### Clarifying Questions

1. What defines points as being in a straight line?
   - Points are in a straight line if the slope between any two pairs of points is the same.
   
2. Are the points guaranteed not to have negative coordinates?
   - Yes, according to constraints.

3. Can we assume that the points are given in integer coordinates?
   - Yes, coordinates are integers as per the problem constraints.

### Strategy

To determine if three points (let's call them A, B, and C) form a boomerang, we need to check if they are not collinear. Points are collinear if the area of the triangle they form is zero, which can be determined using the slope or the area formula of the triangle formed by the points. We'll use the area formula:

For points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), and (x3, y3), they are collinear if:
```
(x2 - x1) * (y3 - y1) == (x3 - x1) * (y2 - y1)
```

This formula essentially checks if the slopes of the lines formed by (A, B) and (A, C) are equal.

### Code

```javascript
function isBoomerang(points) {
    const [p1, p2, p3] = points;
    const [x1, y1] = p1;
    const [x2, y2] = p2;
    const [x3, y3] = p3;

    // Check for collinear points
    return (x2 - x1) * (y3 - y1) !== (x3 - x1) * (y2 - y1);
}

// Example usage:
console.log(isBoomerang([[1,1],[2,3],[3,2]])); // true
console.log(isBoomerang([[1,1],[2,2],[3,3]])); // false
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because the computations involve only a fixed number of operations, and all operations take constant time. Thus, it does not depend on the size of the input.
