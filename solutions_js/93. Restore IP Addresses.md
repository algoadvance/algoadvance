## Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 93: Restore IP Addresses

Given a string containing only digits, return all possible valid IP address combinations that can be formed by inserting dots into the string. You are not allowed to reorder or remove any digits in the string. You can return the answers in any order.

A valid IP address consists of exactly four integers (each integer is between 0 and 255) separated by single dots and cannot have leading zeros. For example, "255.255.11.135" and "192.168.1.1" are valid IP addresses, but "256.256.256.256", "123.123.123.1234", and "123.012.123.123" are invalid IP addresses.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: s = "25525511135"
Output: ["255.255.11.135", "255.255.111.35"]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the input string be empty?
   - No, it's guaranteed there is at least one digit in the input string.
2. What is the maximum length of the input string?
   - The input string length won't exceed 12 characters, as an IP address consists of exactly 4 segments of min 1 and max 3 digits each.
3. Should the output be returned in any specific order?
   - No, the output can be returned in any order.

## Strategy

We will use a backtracking approach to solve this problem. The key steps involved are:

1. Use a backtracking function to try placing dots in different positions in the string.
2. Make sure each segment formed by the dots is valid:
   - It is between 0 and 255.
   - It does not have leading zeros (except for '0').
3. If we have placed 3 dots and our segment is valid, collect this potential IP.
4. Continue the process until all possible valid IP addresses are found.

## Code

```javascript
var restoreIpAddresses = function(s) {
    const result = [];
    
    const backtrack = (path, start) => {
        if (path.length === 4) {
            if (start === s.length) {
                result.push(path.join('.'));
            }
            return;
        }
        
        for (let len = 1; len <= 3; len++) {
            if (start + len > s.length) {
                break;
            }
            
            const segment = s.slice(start, start + len);
            if ((segment.length > 1 && segment[0] === '0') || (parseInt(segment) > 255)) {
                continue;
            }
            
            path.push(segment);
            backtrack(path, start + len);
            path.pop();
        }
    };
    
    backtrack([], 0);
    return result;
};

// Example usage:
let s = "25525511135";
console.log(restoreIpAddresses(s));  // Output: ["255.255.11.135", "255.255.111.35"]
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(1) because:
1. The maximum length of the string s is 12 (as there are only 12 possible digits in a valid IP address).
2. We are trying every possible way to place 3 dots, which at most can be done in a finite number of ways, specifically bounded by the length of the string.

In practice, due to the fixed and small length, the complexity is constant and manageable.
