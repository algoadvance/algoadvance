[Leetcode 144. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l144)
### Problem Statement
144. Binary Tree Preorder Traversal

Given the root of a binary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

**Example:**
```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3]
Output: [1,2,3]
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 100]`.
- `-100 <= Node.val <= 100`

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What is the definition of preorder traversal?
   **A:** Preorder traversal is a type of depth-first traversal. The nodes are processed in this order:
   - Visit the root.
   - Traverse the left subtree.
   - Traverse the right subtree.

2. **Q:** Should I return the traversal as an array of values?
   **A:** Yes, return the preorder traversal as an array of the node values.

3. **Q:** What should we return for an empty tree (`root` is null)?
   **A:** Return an empty array `[]`.

### Strategy
We can solve this problem using both iterative and recursive approaches:

1. **Recursive Approach:**
   - Define a helper function that takes a node and performs the preorder traversal.
   - Initialize an empty result array.
   - If the node is `null`, return (base case).
   - Visit the root node and append its value to the result array.
   - Recursively traverse the left subtree.
   - Recursively traverse the right subtree.

2. **Iterative Approach:**
   - Use a stack to simulate the recursive call stack.
   - Start with the root node in the stack.
   - While the stack is not empty:
     - Pop a node from the stack and append its value to the result array.
     - Push the right child to the stack if it exists (so it is processed after the left child).
     - Push the left child to the stack if it exists.

We will provide both solutions.

### Code

#### Recursive Approach
```javascript
function preorderTraversal(root) {
    const result = [];
    
    function traverse(node) {
        if (!node) return;
        result.push(node.val);  // Visit the root
        traverse(node.left);    // Traverse the left subtree
        traverse(node.right);   // Traverse the right subtree
    }
    
    traverse(root);
    return result;
}
```

#### Iterative Approach
```javascript
function preorderTraversal(root) {
    if (!root) return [];
    
    const result = [];
    const stack = [root];
    
    while (stack.length > 0) {
        const node = stack.pop();
        result.push(node.val);  // Visit the root
        
        if (node.right) {
            stack.push(node.right);  // Traverse the right subtree
        }
        
        if (node.left) {
            stack.push(node.left);   // Traverse the left subtree
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity
For both recursive and iterative approaches:
- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of nodes in the binary tree. Each node is visited exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** 
  - **Recursive Approach:** \(O(n)\) due to the call stack in the worst case (skewed tree).
  - **Iterative Approach:** \(O(n)\) due to the stack that stores nodes.
