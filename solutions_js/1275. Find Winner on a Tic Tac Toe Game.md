[Leetcode 1275. Find Winner on a Tic Tac Toe Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1275)
## Problem Statement
You're given the sequence of moves in a Tic-Tac-Toe game as a list of lists. Each move is represented as a pair [row, col] indicating the cell on the board where the player placed their symbol. Players take turns in the order they appear in the sequence, starting with player A.

You need to determine the winner of the game, which can be:
- "A" if player A wins,
- "B" if player B wins,
- "Draw" if all the cells are filled and no player has won,
- "Pending" if the game has not concluded yet.

The board is a 3x3 grid, and moves are always valid.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Moves Order**: The moves alternate between player A and player B, starting with player A.
2. **Board Size**: The board is always a 3x3 grid.
3. **Move Validity**: We can assume that all moves are valid within the 3x3 grid and no cell is repeated.

## Code
Here's the solution to determine the winner of the Tic Tac Toe game:

```javascript
function tictactoe(moves) {
    // Initializing a 3x3 board with empty values
    const board = Array.from({ length: 3 }, () => Array(3).fill(null));
    
    // Fill the board with moves
    for (let i = 0; i < moves.length; ++i) {
        const player = i % 2 === 0 ? 'A' : 'B';
        const [row, col] = moves[i];
        board[row][col] = player;
    }

    // Function to check the winner
    const checkWinner = (player) => {
        // Check rows, columns and diagonals
        const winHorizontal = board.some(row => row.every(cell => cell === player));
        const winVertical = [0, 1, 2].some(col => board.every(row => row[col] === player));
        const winDiagonal1 = [0, 1, 2].every(i => board[i][i] === player);
        const winDiagonal2 = [0, 1, 2].every(i => board[i][2 - i] === player);
        
        return winHorizontal || winVertical || winDiagonal1 || winDiagonal2;
    }

    // Checking if there is a winner
    if (checkWinner('A')) return 'A';
    if (checkWinner('B')) return 'B';
    
    // If all cells are filled but no winner
    if (moves.length === 9) return 'Draw';
    
    // Otherwise, the game is still pending
    return 'Pending';
}

// Example usage
console.log(tictactoe([[0,0],[2,0],[1,1],[2,1],[2,2]])); // "A"
console.log(tictactoe([[0,0],[1,1],[0,1],[0,2],[1,0],[2,0]])); // "B"
console.log(tictactoe([[0,0],[1,1],[2,0],[1,0],[1,2],[1,1],[2,1],[0,1],[0,2]])); // "Draw"
console.log(tictactoe([[0,0],[1,1]])); // "Pending"
```

## Strategy
1. **Board Initialization**: Set up a 3x3 grid to represent the Tic Tac Toe board.
2. **Move Placement**: Iterate through the given moves and place 'A' or 'B' in the respective cells based on the turn.
3. **Winner Check**:
    - Check for a winner in rows, columns, and both diagonals for each player.
    - If a player wins according to any of these checks, return the winner.
4. **Draw Check**: If all moves are played and no winner, check if there are any empty cells.
5. **Game Status**:
    - If any winner is found, return the respective player.
    - If all cells are filled, return "Draw".
    - Otherwise, return "Pending".

## Time Complexity
The time complexity is O(1) because:
- Setting up the 3x3 board and filling it with moves takes constant time.
- Checking for a winner involves constant checks (since the board size is fixed at 3x3).

Thus, the operations are performed in constant time relative to the board size.
