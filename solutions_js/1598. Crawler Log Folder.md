[Leetcode 1598. Crawler Log Folder](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1598)
### Problem Statement

**1598. Crawler Log Folder**

The Leetcode problem requires you to determine the minimum number of operations needed to go back to the main folder (i.e., the root folder) when given an array of operations. Each operation could be:

- `"../"` - Move to the parent folder (only if currently not in the main folder).
- `"./"` - Stay in the current folder.
- `"x/"` - Move to a child folder named `x`.

You start at the main folder and want to return to the main folder with the minimum operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the input format?**
   - The input is an array of strings where each string is a command representing one of the three operations mentioned above.

2. **What should be returned?**
   - Return the minimum number of operations required to return to the main folder.

3. **Can the current folder go below the root folder?**
   - No, the folder traversal should not allow moving above the root folder.

4. **Is there any constraint on the length of the operations or the names of the folders?**
   - The length of the operations array and folder names are within typical constraints for such problems on Leetcode.

### Code

```javascript
function minOperations(logs) {
    let depth = 0; // Start from the root folder.

    for (let log of logs) {
        if (log === "../") {
            if (depth > 0) {
                depth--; // Go up one level.
            }
        } else if (log !== "./") {
            depth++; // Go into a child folder.
        }
        // If log is "./", we do nothing.
    }

    return depth; // The final depth is the minimum operations to return to the root folder.
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Start at depth `0`, which represents the root folder.
2. **Iterate over logs**: Traverse through each operation in the array:
    - If the operation is `"../"`, decrease the depth by `1` but ensure it doesn't go below `0`.
    - If the operation is `"./"`, do nothing as it indicates staying in the current folder.
    - For any other operation (which means moving into a child folder), increase the depth by `1`.
3. **Return the Depth**: The depth variable at the end of the iteration will represent the number of operations required to return to the root folder.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The time complexity is `O(n)` where `n` is the number of operations in the input array. This is because we are iterating through the array only once.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is `O(1)` as we are using a fixed amount of space regardless of the input size.

This solution effectively tracks the traversal depth and adheres to the problem constraints efficiently.
