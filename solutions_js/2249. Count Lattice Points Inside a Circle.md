[Leetcode 2249. Count Lattice Points Inside a Circle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2249)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of circles where `circles[i] = [xi, yi, ri]` represents the center `(xi, yi)` and radius `ri` of the ith circle in a 2D plane. Return the number of lattice points (points with integer coordinates) that are inside at least one of the circles.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of coordinates and radius**: What are the constraints for the coordinates `(xi, yi)` and radius `ri`?
2. **Expected output format**: Do we need to count lattice points inside all the circles combined or each circle individually and then sum them up?

Given these common details, letâ€™s proceed with a common solution strategy.

### Strategy
1. **Iterate Through Circles**:
   - For each circle, iterate through its bounding box, which ranges from `(xi - ri, yi - ri)` to `(xi + ri, yi + ri)`.
  
2. **Check Lattice Points**:
   - For each point within the bounding box, check if it satisfies the circle equation \((x - xi)^2 + (y - yi)^2 \leq ri^2\). If the condition is satisfied, it means the point is within the circle.

3. **Use a Set for Unique Points**:
   - Use a set to store unique lattice points. This helps in avoiding duplications since different circles may share lattice points.

4. **Count Unique Points**:
   - Finally, return the size of the set which gives the count of unique lattice points.

### Code Implementation
Here is the JavaScript code to implement the above strategy:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} circles
 * @return {number}
 */
var countLatticePoints = function(circles) {
    const points = new Set();
    
    for (const [xi, yi, ri] of circles) {
        for (let x = xi - ri; x <= xi + ri; x++) {
            for (let y = yi - ri; y <= yi + ri; y++) {
                if ((x - xi) ** 2 + (y - yi) ** 2 <= ri ** 2) {
                    points.add(`${x},${y}`);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return points.size;
};
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution depends on the number of circles and the bounding box size for each circle:
- For each circle, we iterate through a bounding box of size \((2r + 1)^2 = 4r^2 + 4r + 1\).
- Let \(n\) be the number of circles and assume \(r\_\max\) is the maximum radius among all circles. The overall time complexity is \(O(n \cdot (4r\_\max^2))\).

In summary, the solution is practical for moderate values of \(n\) and \(r\), providing an efficient way to count lattice points inside multiple circles on a 2D plane.
