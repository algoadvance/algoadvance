[Leetcode 2319. Check if Matrix Is X](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2319)
### Problem Statement

An `n x n` matrix is called an **X-Matrix** if all the elements in the diagonals of the matrix are non-zero and all other elements are zero. Given a 2D integer array `grid` of size `n x n` representing a matrix, return `true` if `grid` is an X-Matrix. Otherwise, return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: Is there any constraint on the size of the matrix `n x n`?
    - **Response**: You can assume that `1 <= n <= 1000`.

2. **Input Validity**: Can we assume that the input matrix will always be a valid n x n matrix?
    - **Response**: Yes, you can assume the input will always be a valid n x n matrix.

3. **Values in the Matrix**: What kind of values can the matrix contain?
    - **Response**: The matrix contains integer values.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Diagonal Elements**:
   - For a cell `(i, j)` in the matrix, it lies on a diagonal if `i == j` (main diagonal) or `i + j == n - 1` (anti-diagonal).
   
2. **Check Diagonal Elements**:
   - Iterate through all cells of the matrix.
   - If the cell is on a diagonal (either main or anti-diagonal), check that it is non-zero.
   - If the cell is not on a diagonal, ensure it is zero.

3. **Early Termination**:
   - If any of the conditions fail (diagonal element is zero or non-diagonal element is non-zero), return `false` immediately.

4. **Return True if All Conditions Hold**:
   - If the loop completes without finding any invalid value, return `true`.

### Code

```javascript
function checkXMatrix(grid) {
    const n = grid.length;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (i === j || i + j === n - 1) {
                // If element is on a diagonal, it must be non-zero
                if (grid[i][j] === 0) {
                    return false;
                }
            } else {
                // If element is not on a diagonal, it must be zero
                if (grid[i][j] !== 0) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return true;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(n^2)**, where `n` is the size of the matrix. This is because we need to iterate through each element of the `n x n` matrix once.

The space complexity is **O(1)** since we are only using a fixed amount of extra space for variables, regardless of the input matrix size.
