[Leetcode 3121. Count the Number of Special Characters II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3121)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, you need to count how many characters in the string are considered "special". A "special" character is defined as a character that is not a letter (a-zA-Z) or a digit (0-9).

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the format of the input string?**
   - The input is a single string `s`.

2. **Is there a constraint on the length of the input string?**
   - Typically, interview problems might have constraints like 1 ≤ `s.length` ≤ 10^5, but we should confirm the actual constraints if specified.

3. **Are there any special characters we need to exclude, such as whitespace?**
   - No exclusions beyond the problem description; all characters that are not letters or digits are considered special.

4. **Should we consider special characters case-sensitively?**
   - Yes, we differentiate characters based only on their classification as letters or digits.

## Strategy

1. **Initialization**: Initialize a counter to zero to keep track of the number of special characters.
2. **Iteration**: Loop through the string and for each character, check if it is a special character.
3. **Condition Check**: A character is a special character if it's neither a letter (a-zA-Z) nor a digit (0-9).
4. **Increment Counter**: For each special character encountered, increment the counter.
5. **Return Result**: Finally, return the counter value.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
function countSpecialCharacters(s) {
    let specialCharCount = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        const char = s[i];
        if (!(/[a-zA-Z0-9]/.test(char))) {
            specialCharCount++;
        }
    }

    return specialCharCount;
}

// Example usage:
const inputString = "Hello, World! 1234@#";
console.log(countSpecialCharacters(inputString)); // Output: 5
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because we iterate through the string once, performing a constant-time check for each character. 

**Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(1)** because we are only using a constant amount of extra space besides the input string.
