[Leetcode 482. License Key Formatting](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l482)
### Problem Statement:

You are given a string `s` that consists of alphanumeric characters and dashes. The string is separated into groups by dashes. You are also given an integer `k`.

We want to reformat the string `s` such that each group contains exactly `k` characters, except for the first group, which could be shorter than `k` but still must contain at least one character. Furthermore, there must be a dash inserted between two groups and all lowercase letters should be converted to uppercase.

Return the reformatted string.

### Example:
```javascript
Input: s = "5F3Z-2e-9-w", k = 4
Output: "5F3Z-2E9W"

Input: s = "2-5g-3-J", k = 2
Output: "2-5G-3J"
```

### Clarifying Questions:

1. Should the first group always be shorter than `k` if necessary to meet the criteria?
   - Yes, the first group can be shorter but must contain at least one character.

2. Should the alphabet characters be converted to uppercase?
   - Yes, all lowercase letters should be converted to uppercase.

### Strategy:

1. **Remove Dashes**: First, remove all the dashes from the input string.
2. **Convert to Uppercase**: Convert the entire string to uppercase.
3. **Determine the First Group Size**: The size of the first group can be less than `k`.
4. **Format Remaining String**: After the first group, ensure that every subsequent group has exactly `k` characters.
5. **Join the Groups**: Join the groups with dashes.

To achieve this, the following steps will be taken:

- Strip all the dashes from the string.
- Convert the string to uppercase.
- Calculate the size of the first group.
- Iterate through the string in chunks of size `k` and append them to the result.

### Code:

```javascript
function licenseKeyFormatting(s, k) {
    // Remove all dashes and convert to uppercase
    let cleanStr = s.replace(/-/g, '').toUpperCase();
    
    // Calculate the length of the first group
    let firstGroupLength = cleanStr.length % k;
    let result = [];
    
    // If first group has length, add it
    if (firstGroupLength > 0) {
        result.push(cleanStr.slice(0, firstGroupLength));
    }
    
    // Process subsequent groups
    for (let i = firstGroupLength; i < cleanStr.length; i += k) {
        result.push(cleanStr.slice(i, i + k));
    }
    
    // Join all groups with dashes
    return result.join('-');
}

// Test cases
console.log(licenseKeyFormatting("5F3Z-2e-9-w", 4)); // 5F3Z-2E9W
console.log(licenseKeyFormatting("2-5g-3-J", 2));    // 2-5G-3J
```

### Time Complexity:

- **String Cleaning and Conversion**: O(n), where `n` is the length of input string `s`.
- **Slice and Join Operations**: O(n), as each index is processed once.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n).

This ensures an efficient reformatting of the license key as per the given constraints.
