[Leetcode 2428. Maximum Sum of an Hourglass](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2428)
### Problem Statement

Given a `m x n` integer matrix `grid`, return the maximum sum of an hourglass.

An hourglass is a subset of values with indices of this form:
```
a b c
  d
e f g
```
The sum of an hourglass is the sum of its values.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What will be the range of values for `m` and `n`?
   - Can the elements in the grid be negative?
   - What should be done if `m` or `n` is less than 3?

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - How to handle grids smaller than 3x3?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use the following steps:
1. Iterate over the grid while considering each possible hourglass starting position.
2. Calculate the sum of the hourglass for the current starting position.
3. Maintain a variable to keep track of the maximum hourglass sum found.

### Code

```javascript
function maxSumOfHourglass(grid) {
    // Get dimensions of the grid
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;
    
    // Edge case: if the grid is smaller than 3x3, return 0 (or handle differently if specified)
    if (m < 3 || n < 3) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    let maxSum = -Infinity;
    
    // Traverse the grid considering each possible hourglass starting point
    for (let i = 0; i <= m - 3; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j <= n - 3; j++) {
            // Compute the sum of the hourglass starting at (i, j)
            let currentHourglassSum =
                grid[i][j] + grid[i][j+1] + grid[i][j+2] +
                             grid[i+1][j+1] +
                grid[i+2][j] + grid[i+2][j+1] + grid[i+2][j+2];
            
            // Update maxSum if the current hourglass sum is larger
            if (currentHourglassSum > maxSum) {
                maxSum = currentHourglassSum;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return maxSum;
}

// Example usage:
const grid = [
    [1, 2, 3, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [2, 1, 4, 0, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
    [1, 2, 3, 0, 0]
];
console.log(maxSumOfHourglass(grid)); // Output: 13
```

### Time Complexity

The overall time complexity for the above solution will be:
- **O(m * n)**, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the input grid.
- This is because we are essentially iterating through all possible hourglass starting points only once.

The space complexity is **O(1)** since we are only using a few extra variables to keep track of the maximum sum and the current hourglass sum.
