[Leetcode 855. Exam Room](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l855)
## Problem Statement

You are implementing an `ExamRoom` class that simulates a student seating arrangement in an examination room. The room has `N` seats in a single row, numbered from `0` to `N-1`.

When a student enters the room, they should sit in the seat that maximizes the distance to the closest person. If there are multiple such seats, the student should sit in the seat with the smallest number.

When a student leaves the room, their seat becomes empty.

Your task is to implement the `ExamRoom` class with the following methods:

1. **`constructor(N: number)`**: Initializes an `ExamRoom` object with `N` seats.
2. **`seat(): number`**: A student enters the room and sits in a seat which maximizes the distance to the closest person. If there are multiple such seats, they sit in the seat with the smallest number.
3. **`leave(p: number): void`**: Student leaves the seat `p`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Are the seats guaranteed to be unique?
   * **A**: Yes, the seats are numbered uniquely from `0` to `N-1`.

2. **Q**: Is `leave(p: number)` always called with a valid seat number (i.e., only for seats that are currently occupied)?
    * **A**: Yes, `leave(p: number)` will only be called for seats that are currently occupied.

3. **Q**: Should the `seat()` function always assume there will be an empty seat available when called?
    * **A**: Yes, `seat()` can presume there's always at least one empty seat when called.

## Strategy

1. **Data Structure**: We'll use a list to store the currently occupied seats in sorted order. This will make finding the optimal seat and handling student exits more efficient.

2. **Seating Strategy**:
   1. If no seats are occupied, the student sits at seat `0`.
   2. Otherwise, compute the maximum distance for each pair of adjacent occupied seats, as well as the distances from the first seat and to the last seat.
   3. Choose the seat that maximizes the minimum distance to the closest occupied seat.

3. **Leaving Strategy**:
   * Remove the seat from the list of occupied seats.

4. **Efficiency**:
   * Use binary search to efficiently insert and remove elements from the list of occupied seats.

## Code

```javascript
class ExamRoom {
    constructor(N) {
        this.N = N;
        this.occupied = [];
    }
    
    seat() {
        if (this.occupied.length === 0) {
            this.occupied.push(0);
            return 0;
        }
        
        let dist = this.occupied[0];
        let seat = 0;
        
        for (let i = 1; i < this.occupied.length; i++) {
            let prev = this.occupied[i - 1];
            let curr = this.occupied[i];
            let mid = Math.floor((prev + curr) / 2);
            
            if (mid - prev > dist) {
                dist = mid - prev;
                seat = mid;
            }
        }
        
        if (this.N - 1 - this.occupied[this.occupied.length - 1] > dist) {
            seat = this.N - 1;
        }
        
        let index = this.occupied.findIndex(s => s > seat);
        this.occupied.splice(index === -1 ? this.occupied.length : index, 0, seat);
        
        return seat;
    }
    
    leave(p) {
        let index = this.occupied.findIndex(s => s === p);
        this.occupied.splice(index, 1);
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **`seat()`**:
   - Finding the optimal seat: `O(K)`, where `K` is the number of occupied seats.
   - Inserting the new seat: `O(K)` as we perform an insertion in a sorted list.
   - Total: `O(K)`.

2. **`leave(p: number)`**:
   - Finding the seat to remove: `O(K)`.
   - Removing the seat: `O(K)`.
   - Total: `O(K)`.

This approach ensures that operations are efficient given that `K` (the number of occupied seats) dynamically changes but is typically much smaller than `N`.
