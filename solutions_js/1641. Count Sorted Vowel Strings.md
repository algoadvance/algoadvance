[Leetcode 1641. Count Sorted Vowel Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1641)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, return the number of strings of length `n` that consist only of vowels (a, e, i, o, u) and are lexicographically sorted.

A string `s` is lexicographically sorted if for all valid `i`, `s[i]` is the same as or comes before `s[i+1]` in the alphabet.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - The problem statement does not specify, but this usually means we should consider up to typical constraint ranges in such problems, which can go up to around \(10^3\) to \(10^6\).

2. **Is there a particular expected time complexity?**
   - An efficient solution is appreciated since `n` may be large.

3. **What should be returned?**
   - The count of lexicographically sorted vowel strings of length `n`.

### Strategy
The task can be approached using a dynamic programming technique or combinatorial mathematics. 

#### Dynamic Programming (DP) Approach:
1. Define `dp[i][j]` where `i` is the length of the string, and `j` indicates the number of starting vowels (from 0 to 5).
2. For each length and each vowel, calculate the number of valid strings by summing up the counts of strings formed with fewer than or equal index vowels.
3. Use the base case where `dp[1][j]` is 1 because there's only one way to create a length-1 string with each vowel.

#### Combinatorial Mathematics:
1. The problem can be reframed as counting the combinations with repetitions allowed.
2. We need to place `n` indistinguishable items (length of the string) into 5 distinguishable bins (the vowels).
3. The formula to determine the number of combinations is given by the binomial coefficient: `C(n + r - 1, r - 1)` where `r` is the number of bins (5 vowels).

We will implement the combinatorial solution for its efficiency.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var countVowelStrings = function(n) {
    // Combinatorial solution using binomial coefficients
    const combination = (n, k) => {
        if (k > n) return 0;
        if (k == 0 || k == n) return 1;
        k = Math.min(k, n - k);  // Take advantage of symmetry
        let c = 1;
        for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
            c = c * (n - i) / (i + 1);
        }
        return c;
    };

    return combination(n + 4, 4);
};

// Example usage:
console.log(countVowelStrings(1)); // Output: 5
console.log(countVowelStrings(2)); // Output: 15
console.log(countVowelStrings(3)); // Output: 35
```

### Time Complexity
The combinatorial solution has a time complexity of O(min(n, k)), where `k` is usually small (â‰¤ 5). Given that `k` is a constant in this problem, the complexity simplifies to O(n), which is efficient compared to other possible methods like DP which may involve nested loops.

This ensures that the solution is both optimal and scalable even for larger values of `n`.
