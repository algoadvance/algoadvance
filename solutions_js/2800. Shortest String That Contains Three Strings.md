[Leetcode 2800. Shortest String That Contains Three Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2800)
### Problem Statement

Given three strings `a`, `b`, and `c`, your goal is to find the shortest string that can contain all the input strings `a`, `b`, and `c` as substrings. If there are multiple shortest strings that meet the criteria, return the lexicographically smallest one. 

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the input strings guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes.

2. **What characters can the input strings contain?**
   - Each string can contain any characters from the lowercase English letters.

3. **Can the input strings be the same?**
   - Yes, input strings can be identical.

4. **What are the constraints on the length of the input strings?**
   - The length of each string is between `1` and `100`.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to find the shortest string that contains all three given strings `a`, `b`, and `c` as substrings. The main steps are as follows:

1. **Generate all possible combinations of merging two strings.**
   - For each pair of strings, find the merged string that can contain both as substrings with the shortest possible length by overlapping them as much as possible.

2. **Merge the third string with each merged result from step 1.**
   - Apply the merging logic again to include the third string into our combined result.

3. **Select the shortest and lexicographically smallest result.**

### Code

```javascript
function shortestStringContainingThree(a, b, c) {
    function mergeStrings(s1, s2) {
        // Merge s2 into s1 with maximum overlap
        for (let i = Math.min(s1.length, s2.length); i > 0; i--) {
            if (s1.endsWith(s2.slice(0, i))) {
                return s1 + s2.slice(i);
            }
        }
        return s1 + s2;
    }

    function possibleResults([s1, s2, s3]) {
        let merged1 = mergeStrings(s1, s2);
        let merged2 = mergeStrings(s2, s1);
        
        let result1 = mergeStrings(merged1, s3);
        let result2 = mergeStrings(merged2, s3);

        // Consider every permutation of merging two first
        return [
            result1,
            mergeStrings(merged1, s3),
            mergeStrings(merged2, s3),
            mergeStrings(s3, merged1),
            mergeStrings(s3, merged2)
        ];
    }

    // Get all possible results for each permutation of (a, b, c)
    let permutations = [
        [a, b, c],
        [a, c, b],
        [b, a, c],
        [b, c, a],
        [c, a, b],
        [c, b, a]
    ];

    let results = [];
    for (let perm of permutations) {
        results.push(...possibleResults(perm));
    }

    // Find the shortest and lexicographically smallest result
    results.sort((str1, str2) => str1.length - str2.length || str1.localeCompare(str2));
    
    return results[0];
}

// Example Usage
console.log(shortestStringContainingThree('abc', 'bca', 'aaa'));  // "aaabca"
console.log(shortestStringContainingThree('ab', 'bc', 'ca'));     // "abca"
```

### Time Complexity

- **Merging Two Strings:** Each merge operation can take `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the longer string.
- **Generating Permutations and Merges:** There are 6 permutations of the three strings, and for each one, we perform multiple merge operations.

Considering the steps involved:
- We perform `O(1)` fixed-step operations for each permutation, combining the strings using `O(n)` merge steps.

Thus, the overall time complexity is dominated by the merging operations and can be considered `O(n)` for practical input sizes where `n` is the length of the input strings (with some constant factor given the fixed permutations involved).
