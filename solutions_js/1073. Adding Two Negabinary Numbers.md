[Leetcode 1073. Adding Two Negabinary Numbers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1073)
### Problem Statement
The problem 1073 on LeetCode is titled "Adding Two Negabinary Numbers". The task is to add two numbers represented in negabinary (base -2) and return the sum in the same negabinary representation. The inputs are two arrays `arr1` and `arr2` where each element in the array represents a digit in the negabinary representation.

For example:
- `arr1 = [1,1,1,1,1]` (which represents `1* (-2)^4 + 1* (-2)^3 + 1* (-2)^2 + 1* (-2)^1 + 1* (-2)^0`).
- `arr2 = [1,0,1]` (which represents `1* (-2)^2 + 1* (-2)^0`).

The expected output is an array representing the sum in negabinary form.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we do if the arrays have different lengths?**
   - We should pad the shorter array with zeros on the left to match the lengths.
   
2. **How to handle possible carry due to the negative base?**
   - We'll need to handle carries differently since the base is negative.

### Solution Strategy

1. **Align the Lengths:**
   - Determine the maximum length between `arr1` and `arr2` and pad the shorter array with zeros.

2. **Initialize Variables:**
   - Create a result array to store the sum and a variable to handle the carry.

3. **Perform Addition:**
   - Traverse from the least significant digit to the most significant one.
   - For each position, add corresponding digits and the carry.
   - Compute the appropriate digit value and carry based on negabinary properties.

4. **Handle Overflow Carry:**
   - After traversing, ensure there are no leftover carries.

5. **Optimize the Result:**
   - Remove leading zeros from the resulting array.

### Code
```javascript
function addNegabinary(arr1, arr2) {
    let maxLength = Math.max(arr1.length, arr2.length);
    let carry = 0;
    let result = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < maxLength || carry != 0; i++) {
        let digit1 = i < arr1.length ? arr1[arr1.length - 1 - i] : 0;
        let digit2 = i < arr2.length ? arr2[arr2.length - 1 - i] : 0;

        let sum = digit1 + digit2 + carry;

        if (sum >= 2) {
            sum -= 2;
            carry = -1;
        } else if (sum < 0) {
            sum += 2;
            carry = 1;
        } else {
            carry = 0;
        }

        result.push(sum);
    }

    // Remove leading zeros from the right side
    while (result.length > 1 && result[result.length - 1] === 0) {
        result.pop();
    }

    return result.reverse();
}

// Example usage:
let arr1 = [1, 1, 1, 1, 1];
let arr2 = [1, 0, 1];
console.log(addNegabinary(arr1, arr2));  // Output: [1, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(N)** where `N` is the maximum length of the input arrays. This results from iterating through the digits of the arrays a single time.
