[Leetcode 2806. Account Balance After Rounded Purchase](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2806)
### Problem Statement

You are given a floating-point number representing the total price of items purchased, referred to as `totalPrice`. The price is to be rounded to the nearest whole number following these rules:
- If the `totalPrice` ends with `.50` and below, you round down.
- If the `totalPrice` ends with `.51` and above, you round up.

You need to calculate and return the account balance if you start with a balance of `100`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format:** Is it guaranteed that `totalPrice` is always a floating-point number?
2. **Rounding Rules:** Can we assume standard rounding rules where anything `.50` and below rounds down and anything `.51` and above rounds up?
3. **Edge Cases:** What about very small (less than `1`) or very large values of `totalPrice`? Are there any specific constraints for `totalPrice`?

### Strategy

1. **Initial Balance:** Start with an initial account balance of `100`.
2. **Rounding the `totalPrice`:**
   - Use JavaScript's `Math.floor` for rounding down.
   - Use JavaScript's `Math.ceil` for rounding up.
3. **Determine the Rounded Purchase:**
   - Extract the decimal part of `totalPrice` (using modulo operation or string manipulation).
   - Decide whether to round up or down based on the decimal part.
4. **Calculate Remaining Balance:** Subtract the rounded purchase amount from the initial balance.

### Time Complexity

- The rounding and subtraction operations are both O(1) operations since they involve simple arithmetic.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} totalPrice - The total price of items purchased.
 * @return {number} - The remaining account balance.
 */
function accountBalanceAfterRoundedPurchase(totalPrice) {
    const initialBalance = 100;
    let roundedPrice;

    // Use string manipulation to find the decimal part
    const parts = totalPrice.toString().split(".");
    
    if (parts.length === 1) {
        roundedPrice = totalPrice;  // No decimal part
    } else {
        const decimalPart = parseFloat("0." + parts[1]);
        if (decimalPart <= 0.5) {
            roundedPrice = Math.floor(totalPrice);
        } else {
            roundedPrice = Math.ceil(totalPrice);
        }
    }

    return initialBalance - roundedPrice;
}

// Example usage:
const totalPrice = 27.73;
console.log(accountBalanceAfterRoundedPurchase(totalPrice)); // Should print 72
```

### Explanation

- **Initial Balance:** Start with `100`.
- **Rounding:**
  - First, extract the decimal part of the `totalPrice`.
  - If there's no decimal part, simply use the integer part as is.
  - If the decimal part is `0.50` or less, round down using `Math.floor`.
  - If the decimal part is greater than `0.50`, round up using `Math.ceil`.
- **Calculate Remaining Balance:** Subtract the rounded value from `100`.

### Time Complexity

This solution performs string operations and simple mathematical calculations which operate in constant time. Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(1).
