[Leetcode 1721. Swapping Nodes in a Linked List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1721)
## Problem Statement
Given the head of a linked list and an integer `k`, swap the values of the `k-th` node from the beginning and the `k-th` node from the end (the list is 1-indexed).

Return the head of the linked list after the swap.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input**:
    - Is it guaranteed that the linked list has at least `k` nodes?
    - Can `k` be greater than the length of the linked list?
    
2. **Output**:
    - Should we return the head of the modified linked list, or just update it in place?
    
3. **Constraints**:
    - Are there any constraints on the list length or node values?
    
Assuming standard constraints similar to other problems without additional complexities.

## Code

```javascript
class ListNode {
    constructor(val = 0, next = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.next = next;
    }
}

function swapNodes(head, k) {
    if (!head) return null;
    
    let first = head;
    let second = head;
    let fast = head;
    
    // Move fast pointer k-1 steps ahead
    for (let i = 0; i < k - 1; i++) {
        if (fast) {
            fast = fast.next;
        }
    }
    
    // Set the first pointer to the k-th node
    first = fast;
    
    // Move fast to the end, maintaining the gap
    while (fast.next) {
        fast = fast.next;
        second = second.next;
    }
    
    // Set the second pointer to the k-th node from the end
    second = second;
    
    // Swap values of the k-th node from the beginning and end
    let temp = first.val;
    first.val = second.val;
    second.val = temp;
    
    return head;
}
```

## Strategy
1. **Two Pointers**:
    - Use three pointers: `first`, `second`, and `fast`.
    - Move `fast` k-1 steps ahead to fix the gap between `first` and the starting point.
    - Now `first` is the k-th node from the beginning.
    - Then move `fast` to the end, while maintaining the initial gap, thus `second` will reach the k-th node from the end.
    - Swap the values of `first` and `second`.
    - Return the modified head of the linked list.

## Time Complexity
- **O(N)**: We traverse the list at most twice (once to position the `fast` pointer k nodes ahead and once to move both `second` and `fast` to their respective positions).
- **Space Complexity**: **O(1)** since we are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.
