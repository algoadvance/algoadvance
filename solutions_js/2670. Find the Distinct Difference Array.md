[Leetcode 2670. Find the Distinct Difference Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2670)
### Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` of length `n`.

The distinct difference array of `nums` is an integer array `diff` of length `n` such that `diff[i]` is equal to the number of distinct elements in the suffix `nums[i+1:]` minus the number of distinct elements in the prefix `nums[0,...,i]`.

Return the distinct difference array of `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions

Q1. What is the range of the elements in the array `nums`?
- A1. The elements can be any integer, positive or negative.

Q2. What is the length of the array `nums`?
- A2. The length of the array `n` can be any size that fits within the constraints of typical LeetCode problems, typically 1 ≤ n ≤ 1000.

### Strategy

1. **Initialization**: 
   - Set up an array `diff` of the same length as `nums` to store the result.

2. **Prefix and Suffix Sets**:
   - Use two sets: one for tracking distinct elements in the prefix and another for the suffix.
   - Start by iterating through the array to fill the `suffixSet` initially with all elements.

3. **Iterative Calculation**:
   - For each index `i` in `nums`:
     - Remove the element from the `suffixSet` since it will become part of the prefix.
     - Add the element to the `prefixSet`.
     - Calculate the difference between the sizes of `suffixSet` and `prefixSet`, and store this value in `diff[i]`.

```javascript
function distinctDifferenceArray(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    const diff = new Array(n);
    const prefixSet = new Set();
    const suffixSet = new Set(nums);

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        suffixSet.delete(nums[i]);
        prefixSet.add(nums[i]);
        diff[i] = suffixSet.size - prefixSet.size;
    }

    return diff;
}
```

### Example

**Input**:
```javascript
let nums = [4, 3, 3, 1];
console.log(distinctDifferenceArray(nums));  // Output: [2, 1, -1, -2]
```

**Explanation**:
- For `i=0`, prefixSet = {4}, suffixSet = {3, 1} -> diff[0] = 2 - 1 = 1
- For `i=1`, prefixSet = {4, 3}, suffixSet = {1} -> diff[1] = 1 - 2 = -1
- For `i=2`, prefixSet = {4, 3}, suffixSet = {1} -> diff[2] = 1 - 2 = -1
- For `i=3`, prefixSet = {4, 3, 1}, suffixSet = {} -> diff[3] = 0 - 3 = -3

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this solution is **O(n)** because we iterate through the array of length `n` once, and each operation inside the loop runs in average O(1) time due to the properties of JavaScript's `Set`. Thus, the overall complexity is linear.
