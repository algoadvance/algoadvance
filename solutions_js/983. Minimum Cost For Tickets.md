[Leetcode 983. Minimum Cost For Tickets](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l983)
### Problem Statement

You have planned some train traveling one year in advance. The days of the year in which you will travel are given as an array called `days`. Each day is an integer from 1 to 365.

Train tickets are sold in three different ways:
1. a 1-day pass for `costs[0]`,
2. a 7-day pass for `costs[1]`, and
3. a 30-day pass for `costs[2]`.

The passes allow that many days of consecutive travel.

Return the minimum cost needed to travel on all the given days.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the values in `days` guaranteed to be within the range of 1 to 365?**
   - Yes, the values in `days` are guaranteed to be within that range.
   
2. **Is the array `days` sorted?**
   - Yes, the array `days` is sorted in ascending order.
   
3. **Can we assume all elements in `days` are unique?**
   - Yes, each element in `days` represents a unique travel day.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - We will use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum cost required to cover days up to `days[i]`.
   - We can initialize `dp` with a size equal to the last travel day + 1, filled with infinity. This essentially ensures that all invalid days are initially set to the highest possible cost.
   - We will iterate through each day in `days`, and for each day, we will calculate the cost of using a 1-day pass, a 7-day pass, and a 30-day pass. 
   - Our target is to find the minimum cost for each travel day and continue updating the `dp` array based on the decisions made for each travel pass type.

2. **Base Cases**:
   - If there are no travel days, the cost should be 0:
     ```js
     if(days.length === 0) return 0;
     ```

### Code

```javascript
function mincostTickets(days, costs) {
    const n = days.length;
    const maxDay = days[n-1];
    const dp = new Array(maxDay + 1).fill(0);
    const daySet = new Set(days);
    
    for (let i = 1; i <= maxDay; i++) {
        if (!daySet.has(i)) {
            dp[i] = dp[i - 1];  // no travel needed on this day
        } else {
            let cost1 = dp[i - 1] + costs[0];
            let cost7 = dp[Math.max(0, i - 7)] + costs[1];
            let cost30 = dp[Math.max(0, i - 30)] + costs[2];
            dp[i] = Math.min(cost1, cost7, cost30);
        }
    }
    
    return dp[maxDay];
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N), where N is the maximum calendar day specified in `days`. This is because we iterate up to the largest day in the travel schedule.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N), where N is the maximum day value in the `days` array, due to the dynamic programming array `dp`. This ensures that we use space proportional to the days under consideration.

The time and space complexity can be considered optimal given that we are dealing with a potential range of 1 to 365. A more specialized approach to further optimize space might be considered but typically isn't necessary for an array size of less than 400 elements.
