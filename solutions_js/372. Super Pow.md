[Leetcode 372. Super Pow](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l372)
### Problem Statement

Given two positive integers `a` and `b`, represented as `a` and `b = [b0, b1, ..., bn-1]`, where the exponent `b` is a list of digits, compute `a` raised to the power of `b` modulo `1337`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can `a` be zero?
   - **A**: No, the problem guarantees `a` is a positive integer.

2. **Q**: How large can the list `b` be?
   - **A**: The list `b` can potentially be very large, representing a very large number exponent.

3. **Q**: Should the solution handle exceedingly large results?
   - **A**: Yes, which is why the problem specifies calculating the result modulo `1337`.

4. **Q**: Can `b` have leading zeros?
   - **A**: Given that `b` is an exponent, leading zeros in `b` would not affect the result.

### Strategy

1. **Breaking down the power calculation**:
   - Given the nature of large exponents, directly computing `a^b` is impractical.
   - We can use properties of modular arithmetic and exponentiation by squaring to make the problem more manageable.

2. **Using Modular Arithmetic**:
   - Given `a^(b0 + b1*10 + ... + bn-1*10^(n-1))`, we can break this down using properties of mod:
   - `a^((...((b0 * 10 + b1) * 10 + b2) * 10 + ... + bn-1)) % 1337`.

3. **Exponentiation by Squaring**:
   - Use repeated squaring to efficiently compute large powers modulo some number.

### Code

```javascript
const MOD = 1337;

function superPow(a, b) {
    function powmod(x, n, mod) {
        x %= mod;
        let result = 1;
        while (n > 0) {
            if (n % 2 === 1) { // if n is odd
                result = (result * x) % mod;
            }
            x = (x * x) % mod; // x = x^2
            n = Math.floor(n / 2);
        }
        return result;
    }

    function superPowHelper(a, list) {
        if (list.length === 0) return 1;
        let lastDigit = list.pop();
        let part1 = powmod(a, lastDigit, MOD);
        let part2 = powmod(superPowHelper(a, list), 10, MOD);
        return (part1 * part2) % MOD;
    }

    return superPowHelper(a, b);
}

// Example usage
console.log(superPow(2, [1, 0])); // Output should be 1024 % 1337 = 1024
console.log(superPow(2, [3]));    // Output should be 8 % 1337 = 8
```

### Time Complexity

- **Exponentiation by Squaring**: Each call to `powmod` runs in `O(log n)` time where `n` is the exponent.
- **Recursive Depth**: The recursion depth equals the number of digits in `b`.

Thus, the time complexity for this solution is approximately `O(m log k)` where `m` is the number of digits in `b` and `k` is the largest value encountered in the exponentiation steps.
