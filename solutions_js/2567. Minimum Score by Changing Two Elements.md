[Leetcode 2567. Minimum Score by Changing Two Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2567)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums`. You need to perform the following operation:

- Choose two distinct indices `i` and `j` such that `i != j`.
- Change the values of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` to any other integers.

After performing this operation, you need to determine the minimum possible value of the "score" of the array. The score of the array is defined as `max(nums) - min(nums)`.

Write a function `minimizeScore` to determine the minimum possible score after changing two elements as described above.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the indices `i` and `j` be any indices within the bounds of the array?
    - Yes, as long as they are distinct, i.e., `i != j`.
  
2. Are negative numbers allowed in the array?
    - Yes, the array can contain negative numbers.
  
3. What are the constraints on the length of the array `nums`?
    - Typically for LeetCode problems, constraints like `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5` can be expected.

### Strategy

1. **Identify Boundary Conditions:** 
    - If the array's length is 2, then the difference will always be 0 as there are only two numbers to change.
  
2. **Determine Candidates for Change:**
    - The goal is to minimize the difference `max(nums) - min(nums)`. 
    - Changes should ideally target the current maximum and minimum values in the array or the nearest values to them if they cannot be directly changed.
  
3. **Sorting Approach:**
    - Sort the array to easily access the smallest and largest elements.
    - Change the two largest elements to be closer to or within the range of the smaller elements and vice versa.
  
4. **Evaluate Possible Changes and Calculate Scores:**
    - After sorting, evaluate scores after modifying edge values:
        - Decrease the highest values
        - Increase the lowest values
    - Compare and return the minimum score obtained.

### Code

Here's a JavaScript function to solve the problem:

```javascript
function minimizeScore(nums) {
    // Edge case: if the array has less than 4 elements
    if (nums.length < 4) {
        return 0; // Changing the only two elements to be equal results in a zero difference
    }

    // Sort the array to access min and max easily and their neighbours
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    // Candidates for minimizing score by changing two elements
    let n = nums.length;
    
    // Possible changes:
    // 1. Change two smallest elements
    // 2. Change one smallest and one second smallest
    // 3. Change one largest and one second largest
    // 4. Change two largest elements
    
    let score1 = nums[n-1] - nums[2]; // Changing the first two smallest elements
    let score2 = nums[n-2] - nums[1]; // Changing one smallest and one second smallest
    let score3 = nums[n-3] - nums[0]; // Changing one largest and one second largest
    let score4 = nums[n-4] - nums[0]; // Changing the first two largest elements

    // return the minimum score
    return Math.min(score1, score2, score3, score4);
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the array:** \(O(n \log n)\)
- **Calculating scores from sorted array:** \(O(1)\)

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\). This is efficient given typical constraints (e.g., up to \(10^5\) elements).
