[Leetcode 1537. Get the Maximum Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1537)
## Problem Statement
1537. **Get the Maximum Score**

You are given two **sorted** arrays of distinct integers `nums1` and `nums2`.

A valid **path** is defined as follows:
1. Choose array `nums1` or `nums2` to traverse (from index 0).
2. Traverse the current array.
3. If you are at index `i` on `nums1` and `nums1[i]` == `nums2[j]`, you can choose to jump to index `j` in `nums2` with the condition that you can only make the jump at most once.

Your goal is to maximize your sum while traversing through the arrays.

Return the maximum sum you can obtain. Since the answer may be too large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Example
```plaintext
Example 1:
Input: nums1 = [2,4,5,8,10], nums2 = [4,6,8,9]
Output: 30
Explanation: 
Valid paths are:
[2,4,5,8,10] = 2 + 4 + 5 + 8 + 10 = 29
[2,4,6,8,10] = 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10 = 30

Example 2:
Input: nums1 = [1,3,5,7,9], nums2 = [3,5,100]
Output: 109
Explanation: 
Valid path is: [1,3,5,100] = 1 + 3 + 5 + 100 = 109

Example 3:
Input: nums1 = [1,2,3,4,5], nums2 = [6,7,8,9,10]
Output: 40
Explanation: 
Valid path is: [1,2,3,4,5] = 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15
```

### Constraints
- `1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 10^5`
- `1 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 10^7`
- `nums1` and `nums2` are strictly increasing.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the solution use dynamic programming?**
   - Yes, dynamic programming is a feasible approach to solve this problem due to overlapping subproblems.
   
2. **Should I consider edge cases where one array is a subset of another?**
   - Yes, ensure that edge cases are covered.

## Strategy
1. Use two pointers to traverse both arrays while keeping track of two accumulative sums: one for `nums1` and one for `nums2`.
2. If elements are equal, take the maximum of the two paths at that point and add to the global sum. Reset accumulative sums accordingly.
3. Continue traversing until all elements in both arrays are covered.
4. Return the total sum modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Code
```javascript
const maxSum = (nums1, nums2) => {
    const MOD = 1e9 + 7;
    let i = 0, j = 0, sum1 = 0, sum2 = 0, result = 0;

    while (i < nums1.length && j < nums2.length) {
        if (nums1[i] < nums2[j]) {
            sum1 += nums1[i++];
        } else if (nums1[i] > nums2[j]) {
            sum2 += nums2[j++];
        } else {
            result += Math.max(sum1, sum2) + nums1[i];
            i++;
            j++;
            sum1 = 0;
            sum2 = 0;
        }
    }

    while (i < nums1.length) sum1 += nums1[i++];
    while (j < nums2.length) sum2 += nums2[j++];
    
    result += Math.max(sum1, sum2);
    return result % MOD;
};
```

## Time Complexity
- The time complexity of this solution is **O(n + m)** where `n` is the length of `nums1` and `m` is the length of `nums2`, as we make a single pass through both arrays.
- The space complexity is **O(1)** since we use only a fixed number of additional variables.
