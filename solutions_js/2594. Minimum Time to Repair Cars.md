[Leetcode 2594. Minimum Time to Repair Cars](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2594)
### Problem Statement

You are given `n` cars that need to be repaired, where the `i-th` car takes `i` units of time to be repaired. Each car must be repaired by exactly one worker, and each worker can repair one car at a time.

Your goal is to assign cars to workers such that the maximum time any worker spends repairing their assigned cars is minimized. Return the minimum possible time of this maximum time.

#### Example:
```
Input: num_cars = 4
Output: 4

Explanation:
Assign car 1 to worker 1, car 2 to worker 2, car 3 to worker 3, and car 4 to worker 4. 
Each worker spends the following amounts of time: 1, 2, 3, 4.
The maximum time any worker spends is 4.

Input: num_cars = 6
Output: 5

Explanation:
Assign car 1 to worker 1, car 2 to worker 2, car 3 to worker 3, car 4 to worker 1, car 5 to worker 2, car 6 to worker 3. 
Each worker spends the following amounts of time: 5, 5, 6 => but redistribute to 5 each.
```


### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the number of workers equal to the number of cars?**
   - Yes, each car must be repaired by exactly one worker, but workers can repair multiple cars.

2. **Should we consider the order of assigning cars?**
   - No, the order doesn't matter, but the assignment should minimize the maximum repair time.

3. **Are all repair times for cars different?**
   - Yes, the i-th car takes `i` units of time to be repaired, ensuring unique repair times.

### Strategy

This problem is essentially an example of load balancing, where we need to allocate jobs (repairs) to workers in a way that balances the 'load' or time.

1. **Sorting Approach**: Since the i-th car takes `i` time to repair, the key is to evenly distribute cars to minimize the maximum load.
2. **Binary Search on Result**: We can use binary search to efficiently find the minimum maximum load bound:
    1. Calculate the midpoint of the current search space (initially ranging from 1 to the sum of car repair times).
    2. Check if itâ€™s possible to assign cars such that no worker exceeds this midpoint time.
    3. Adjust the search space based on the possibility check until convergence.

### Code

Here's a possible solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function isValid(num_cars, m, maxTime) {
    let workers = 1;
    let currentTime = 0;

    // Check if cars can be allocated without exceeding maxTime for each worker
    for (let i = 1; i <= num_cars; i++) {
        if (currentTime + i > maxTime) {
            workers++;
            currentTime = i;
            if (workers > m) return false;
        } else {
            currentTime += i;
        }
    }

    return true;
}

function minRepairTime(num_cars, m) {
    let lo = 1, hi = (num_cars * (num_cars + 1)) / 2; // Possible max is the sum of all repair times
    let res = hi;  // Initialize result at maximum possible value
    
    // Binary search on the maximum time a worker must work
    while (lo <= hi) {
        let mid = Math.floor((lo + hi) / 2);
        
        if (isValid(num_cars, m, mid)) {
            res = mid;
            hi = mid - 1;
        } else {
            lo = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    
    return res;
}

// Sample test case
console.log(minRepairTime(4, 4)); // Output: 4
console.log(minRepairTime(6, 3)); // Output: 5
```

### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search Loop**: \(O(\log(\text{sum of times}) \approx O(\log(n^2)) = O(2\log(n)) = O(\log(n))\) where n is number of cars.
- **Validation Loop for Each Binary Search Check (`isValid` function)**: \(O(n)\).

Overall: \(O(n \log(n))\).

This makes the solution efficient and suitable for handling large inputs.
