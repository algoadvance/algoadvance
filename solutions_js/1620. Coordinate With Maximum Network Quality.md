[Leetcode 1620. Coordinate With Maximum Network Quality](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1620)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array `towers`, where `towers[i] = [xi, yi, qi]` denotes the coordinates `(xi, yi)` of the `i`-th cell tower and the quality of its signal `qi`. You are also given an integer `radius` denoting the effective range of the towers.

The signal quality of a tower at coordinates `(xi, yi)` and quality `qi` at a coordinate `(x, y)` within its radius is calculated by the formula:
\[ \text{signal} = \left\lfloor \frac{qi}{1 + \sqrt{(x - xi)^2 + (y - yi)^2}} \right\rfloor \]

If the distance between the tower and the coordinate is greater than `radius`, the tower does not contribute to the signal quality at that coordinate.

Return the coordinates `[x, y]` of the network quality with the maximal `x` first, and if there is a tie, return the coordinate with the maximal `y` second.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of the coordinates `(xi, yi)` and signal quality `qi`?
2. What should be done if there are multiple points with the same network quality?
3. Does the point need to be an integer coordinate?
4. Example input and output to understand the problem better?

### Strategy
1. **Identify Range**: Identify the range within which the solution can exist. The bounds can be set by finding the min and max coordinates possible from given towers plus/minus the radius.
2. **Brute Force Method**: Iterate through all possible integer coordinates within the identified bounds and calculate the network quality using the given formula.
3. **Comparison**: Keep track of the maximum network quality found and update the coordinates accordingly.
4. **Tie-breaking**: If there is a tie in the network quality, choose coordinates with a higher x value first, and if still tied, choose the higher y value.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity is roughly \(O((maxX - minX) * (maxY - minY) * N)\), where:
- \(maxX\) and \(minX\) are the extreme x-coordinates,
- \(maxY\) and \(minY\) are the extreme y-coordinates,
- \(N\) is the number of towers.
This arises because for each point inside the bounding box, we potentially check all towers.

### Code
Here's how you might implement this:

```javascript
var bestCoordinate = function(towers, radius) {
    let maxQuality = -1;
    let bestCoord = [0, 0];
    
    // Determine bounds
    let minX = Infinity, minY = Infinity, maxX = -Infinity, maxY = -Infinity;
    for (let [xi, yi, qi] of towers) {
        minX = Math.min(minX, xi);
        maxX = Math.max(maxX, xi);
        minY = Math.min(minY, yi);
        maxY = Math.max(maxY, yi);
    }
    
    // Iterate over all points in bounding box
    for (let x = minX - radius; x <= maxX + radius; x++) {
        for (let y = minY - radius; y <= maxY + radius; y++) {
            let currentQuality = 0;
            for (let [xi, yi, qi] of towers) {
                let dist = Math.sqrt((x - xi) ** 2 + (y - yi) ** 2);
                if (dist <= radius) {
                    currentQuality += Math.floor(qi / (1 + dist));
                }
            }
            if (currentQuality > maxQuality || 
               (currentQuality === maxQuality && (x > bestCoord[0] || (x === bestCoord[0] && y > bestCoord[1])))) {
                maxQuality = currentQuality;
                bestCoord = [x, y];
            }
        }
    }
    
    return bestCoord;
};
```

This approach considers every possible point within the bounds and evaluates the total network quality it can receive, updating the coordinates accordingly when a higher quality or more suitable point is found.
