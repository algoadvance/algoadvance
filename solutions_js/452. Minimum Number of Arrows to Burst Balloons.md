[Leetcode 452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l452)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `points` where `points[i] = [start, end]` represents the starting and ending coordinates of the ith balloon. Balloons are filled with helium and will burst if any point is shot with an arrow. An arrow can be shot at a single point and can burst any balloon whose range covers that point. 

Return the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: points = [[10,16],[2,8],[1,6],[7,12]]
Output: 2
Explanation: For example, if you shoot an arrow at x = 6, the balloons [2,8] and [1,6] will burst. And if you shoot an arrow at x = 11, the remaining two balloons [10,16] and [7,12] will burst.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - Are the balloons' `start` and `end` points inclusive?
     - **Yes, they are inclusive.**
   - What is the range of the input array length and the balloon coordinates?
     - **The length of `points` can be between 1 and 10^4, and the coordinates can be in the range from -10^4 to 10^4.**

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - What if there's only one balloon?
     - **Only one arrow is needed in this case.**

### Strategy

1. **Sorting:** 
   - First, we sort the balloons based on their ending coordinates. This helps in identifying the minimum points to shoot the arrows more effectively.

2. **Iterate and Burst:**
   - Initialize the first arrow to be shot at the end of the first balloon interval.
   - Iterate through the sorted list and whenever we find a balloon that starts after the position of the last shot arrow, we need another arrow. Move the shooting point to the end of this new balloon.

### Code

```javascript
function findMinArrowShots(points) {
    if (points.length === 0) return 0;

    // Sort the points by the ending coordinate
    points.sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1]);

    let arrows = 1;
    let firstEnd = points[0][1];

    for (let i = 1; i < points.length; i++) {
        if (points[i][0] > firstEnd) {
            arrows++;
            firstEnd = points[i][1];
        }
    }

    return arrows;
}

// Example usage:
const points = [[10, 16], [2, 8], [1, 6], [7, 12]];
console.log(findMinArrowShots(points)); // Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** The main time complexity comes from sorting the `points` array, which is \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Iteration:** After sorting, we iterate through the array once, which is \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

### Conclusion

The provided solution sorts the balloon intervals by their ending coordinates and then uses a greedy approach to find the minimum number of arrows needed to burst all balloons. The critical insight is that by sorting by the end of the intervals, we can efficiently determine the minimal points to shoot the arrows.
