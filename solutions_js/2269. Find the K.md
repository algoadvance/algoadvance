[Leetcode 2269. Find the K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2269)
## Problem Statement

The K-Beauty of a number is defined as the number of contiguous substrings of length `k` in the number that are divisible by the number itself. More formally, for a given number `num` and an integer `k`, a substring of `num` of length `k` is considered beautiful if:
1. The substring can be converted to an integer.
2. This integer is divisible by `num`.

Given a number and an integer `k`, the objective is to determine how many k-beautiful substrings are there in the given number.

### Example
- Input: `num = 240`, `k = 2`
- Output: 2
Explanation: 
- Substrings of length 2 are 24, 40. 
- 24 and 40 both are divisible by 240.
  
## Clarifying Questions
1. **Range and Limits:** What are the constraints on the size of `num` and the value of `k`?
2. **Edge Cases:** What if `k` is larger than the length of `num`?
3. **Numerical Type:** Since the input number can be very large, should we treat `num` as a string to avoid integer overflow?

## Strategy
1. Convert the number to a string to handle very large numbers efficiently.
2. Use a sliding window of size `k` to extract all possible substrings of length `k`.
3. For each substring, convert it to an integer and check if `num % integer == 0`.
4. Count all substrings that satisfy this condition.
5. Return the count.

## Time Complexity
The time complexity is O(n * k), where `n` is the number of digits in `num`, due to the substring extraction and divisibility check for each substring.

## Code

```javascript
var divisorSubstrings = function(num, k) {
    const strNum = num.toString();
    const length = strNum.length;
    let count = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i <= length - k; i++) {
        const subStr = strNum.substring(i, i + k);
        const subInt = parseInt(subStr, 10);
        
        if (subInt !== 0 && num % subInt === 0) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
};

// Example usage:
const num = 240;
const k = 2;
console.log(divisorSubstrings(num, k)); // Output: 2
```

## Explanation
- **Convert to String:** Convert `num` to a string to handle potentially large numbers without overflow.
- **Sliding Window:** Loop through the number using a sliding window to extract substrings of length `k`.
- **Divisibility Check:** For each substring, convert it to an integer and check if it divides `num` without a remainder.
- **Count Beautiful Substrings:** Maintain a count of substrings that meet the criteria.
- **Return Result:** Return the final count of such substrings.

This approach ensures we methodically evaluate each possible substring and efficiently determine the K-beauty of the number.
