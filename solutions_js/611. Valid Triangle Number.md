[Leetcode 611. Valid Triangle Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l611)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of triplets chosen from the array that can make triangles if we take them as side lengths of a triangle.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What are the constraints on the number of elements in the array?
   - **A:** The number of elements in the array `nums` can range from \(0\) to \(1000\).

2. **Q:** What are the constraints on the values of the elements in the array?
   - **A:** The value of each element in the array can range from \(0\) to \(1000\).

3. **Q:** Can the elements of the array be repeated?
   - **A:** Yes, the elements can be repeated.

4. **Q:** What should we return if no triplets can form a valid triangle?
   - **A:** Return `0`.

### Strategy

To form a valid triangle with sides \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), the following conditions must be met:
1. \(a + b > c\)
2. \(a + c > b\)
3. \(b + c > a\)

Given that we need a triplet \((i, j, k)\) with \(i < j < k\), which efficiently translates to sorted array checks:
- If the array is sorted such that \(a \leq b \leq c\), then we only need to check \(a + b > c\) (since the sorted property ensures \(a \leq b \leq c\)).

### Approach

1. **Sort the array.**
2. Use a three-pointer approach:
   - Fix the third pointer `k` at the last index and decrease it while moving.
   - Use two pointers `i` (starting from the beginning) and `j` (starting right before `k`).
   - Check for the triangle condition \(nums[i] + nums[j] > nums[k]\):
     - If true, count all valid pairs between `i` and `j` for the current `k`.
     - Else, move the `i` pointer to the right.

### Code

```javascript
function triangleNumber(nums) {
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let count = 0;
    
    for (let k = nums.length - 1; k > 1; k--) {
        let i = 0, j = k - 1;
        
        while (i < j) {
            if (nums[i] + nums[j] > nums[k]) {
                count += j - i;
                j--; // move `j` leftwards
            } else {
                i++; // move `i` rightwards
            }
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}
```

### Time Complexity

**Sorting:** \(O(n \log n)\)

**Three-Pointer Traversal:** The outer loop runs \(n - 2\) times and the inner loop traverses \(j + i\) which is linear in regards to \(n\). Therefore, the overall time complexity is:

- Sorting: \(O(n \log n)\)
- Pointer traversal: \(O(n^2)\)

**Total complexity:** \(O(n^2)\)

This solution is efficient and works well within the given constraints.
