[Leetcode 1455. Check If a Word Occurs As a Prefix of Any Word in a Sentence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1455)
## Problem Statement
You are given a string `sentence` that consists of words separated by spaces, and a string `searchWord`. Determine if `searchWord` is a prefix of any word in `sentence`. Return the index of the word in `sentence` where `searchWord` is a prefix. If `searchWord` is a prefix of more than one word, return the index of the first word (1-indexed). If `searchWord` is not a prefix of any word, return -1.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:** Are there any constraints on the length of the strings `sentence` and `searchWord`?
   - Typically constraints are given in the problem, but usually, `sentence` can be quite large.
2. **Case Sensitivity:** Should the search be case-sensitive? 
   - This can affect the implementation, but usually, a specified problem will denote whether case sensitivity is an issue.
3. **Characters:** Are we assured that inputs are valid? (i.e., they contain only letters and spaces)
4. **Output Convention:** The index should be 1-indexed as per the problem statement.

## Code
Below is the code to solve the problem:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} sentence
 * @param {string} searchWord
 * @return {number}
 */
var isPrefixOfWord = function(sentence, searchWord) {
    // Split the sentence into words
    const words = sentence.split(' ');
    
    // Loop through each word and check if 'searchWord' is a prefix of the word
    for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
        if (words[i].startsWith(searchWord)) {
            // Return 1-indexed position
            return i + 1;
        }
    }
    
    // If no prefix found, return -1
    return -1;
};
```

## Strategy
1. **Split the Sentence:** Use the `split` method on the `sentence` string to separate it into individual words based on spaces.
2. **Iterate Through the Words:** Loop through each word in the resultant array and use the `startsWith` method to check if `searchWord` is the prefix of the current word.
3. **Index Adjustment:** Since words are 1-indexed in the output, return `i + 1` if a match is found.
4. **Return -1 if No Match:** If the loop completes without finding a match, return -1.

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n * m), where `n` is the number of words in the sentence and `m` is the average length of the words. This results from needing to potentially check the beginning of each word in the worst case.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) due to the storage of the words array.

This solution efficiently handles the conditions provided by the problem and returns the correct 1-indexed position or -1 as required.
