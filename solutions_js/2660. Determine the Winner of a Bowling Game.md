[Leetcode 2660. Determine the Winner of a Bowling Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2660)
## Problem Statement

You are playing a simplified version of a bowling game with your friend. The game consists of a single round with `n` turns per player. You and your friend take turns alternatively. The scores of you and your friend are given in two integer arrays `you` and `friend`, respectively, where `you[i]` is your score in the `i-th` turn and `friend[i]` is your friend's score in the `i-th` turn.

The winner of the game is the player with the higher total score. If both players have the same total score, the game is a draw.

Write a function to determine the winner of the bowling game. If you win, return `"You"`, if your friend wins, return `"Friend"`, and if the game is a draw, return `"Draw"`.

### Function Signature
```javascript
function determineWinner(you, friend) {
    // implementation
}
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. What are the constraints on the length of the arrays `you` and `friend`?
   - The arrays `you` and `friend` will have the same length `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100).

2. Can the scores be negative?
   - Let's assume all the scores are non-negative integers.

3. What is the maximum possible value for each score in the arrays?
   - Assume the scores are within the range of standard bowling pin counts, i.e., 0 to 300.

## Strategy

1. Calculate the total score for both players by summing up the respective arrays.
2. Compare the total scores and determine the winner accordingly.
3. Return `"You"` if your score is higher, `"Friend"` if your friend's score is higher, and `"Draw"` if the scores are equal.

## Code

```javascript
function determineWinner(you, friend) {
    // Calculate the total score for you
    const yourTotal = you.reduce((sum, score) => sum + score, 0);

    // Calculate the total score for your friend
    const friendTotal = friend.reduce((sum, score) => sum + score, 0);

    // Determine the winner based on the total scores
    if (yourTotal > friendTotal) {
        return "You";
    } else if (friendTotal > yourTotal) {
        return "Friend";
    } else {
        return "Draw";
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of our solution is **O(n)** where `n` is the number of elements in the `you` and `friend` arrays. This is because we iterate through each array once to compute the total scores. The space complexity is **O(1)**, as we are using a constant amount of additional space regardless of the input size.

## Example

```javascript
console.log(determineWinner([100, 200], [150, 150])); // "Draw"
console.log(determineWinner([150, 150], [100, 200])); // "You"
console.log(determineWinner([100, 200], [200, 200])); // "Friend"
```
