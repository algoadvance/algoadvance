[Leetcode 1111. Maximum Nesting Depth of Two Valid Parentheses Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1111)
### Problem Statement

Given a balanced parentheses string `s`, you need to split it into two disjoint subsequences `A` and `B`, such that each subsequence is valid and has a balanced parentheses string. A balanced parentheses string is defined as:
- An empty string, or
- A single pair of parentheses `()`, or
- An open parentheses `(` followed by a balanced parentheses string followed by a close parentheses `)`.

The goal is to maximize the minimum nesting depth of the two transformed strings `A` and `B`.

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= s.length <= 10^5`
- s[i] is either `'('` or `')'`.
- The string is guaranteed to be balanced.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is meant by nesting depth?**
   - The nesting depth of a valid parentheses string is the maximum number of open parentheses seen before encountering a closing parenthesis.

2. **What do you mean by disjoint subsequences?**
   - Disjoint subsequences mean that every character from the original string `s` should appear in one and only one of the subsequences `A` or `B`.

3. **Can we assume that the input string `s` is always valid and balanced?**
   - Yes, based on the problem constraints, the string is guaranteed to be valid and balanced.

### Strategy

To distribute the parentheses in such a way that the minimum nesting depth of the two sequences is maximized, we can adopt the following strategy:
- Traverse the string and for each opening parenthesis `(`, alternate assigning it to sequences `A` and `B`.
- For each closing parenthesis `)`, assign it to the same sequence to balance the corresponding opening parenthesis.

This ensures that we evenly distribute the nested parentheses between the two sequences.

### Code

```javascript
var maxDepthAfterSplit = function(s) {
    const n = s.length;
    let depth = 0;
    const res = new Array(n);
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (s[i] === '(') {
            depth++;
            res[i] = depth % 2; // Alternating between 0 and 1
        } else {
            res[i] = depth % 2; // Close the corresponding parenthesis in the same sequence
            depth--;
        }
    }
    
    return res;
};

// Example usage:
const s = "(()())";
console.log(maxDepthAfterSplit(s)); // Output could be [0,1,1,1,1,0] or similar split
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because we are traversing the string once and performing constant-time operations for each character.

### Explanation
1. Initiate the depth to zero and create an array `res` to store the result.
2. Loop through each character in the string:
   - If it's an opening parenthesis `(`, increment the depth and assign it to either sequence `A` (0) or `B` (1) based on the depth parity (even or odd).
   - If it's a closing parenthesis `)`, assign it to the same sequence as its corresponding opening parenthesis and decrement the depth.
3. Return the array `res`, which contains the assignments of each character to either sequence 0 or 1. 

This ensures that the nesting depths are balanced between the two sequences, maximizing the minimum nesting depth.
