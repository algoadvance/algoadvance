[Leetcode 1452. People Whose List of Favorite Companies Is Not a Subset of Another List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1452)
### Problem Statement

Given the list of lists `favoriteCompanies` where `favoriteCompanies[i]` is the list of favorite companies for the `i-th` person (indexed from 0), return a list of indices of people whose list of favorite companies is **not** a subset of any other list of favorite companies. You must return the indices in increasing order.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: favoriteCompanies = [
                               ["leetcode","google","facebook"], 
                               ["google","microsoft"], 
                               ["google","facebook"], 
                               ["google"], 
                               ["amazon"]
                            ]
Output: [0,1,4]
Explanation: 
- Person with index 0 has list ["leetcode","google","facebook"] which is not a subset of any other list.
- Person with index 1 has list ["google","microsoft"] which is not a subset of any other list.
- Person with index 4 has list ["amazon"] which is not a subset of any other list.
- Person with index 2 has list ["google","facebook"] which is a subset of person with index 0.
- Person with index 3 has list ["google"] which is a subset of person with index 0, index 1, and index 2.
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. How large can the input `favoriteCompanies` be? (to consider time complexity)
2. Are the company names guaranteed to be unique within each person’s list?
3. How should we handle cases where multiple indices have lists with the exact same companies?

### Strategy
1. **Convert the Lists to Sets**: This will make checking if one list is a subset of another more efficient.
2. **Use a Nested Loop**: For each person, check if their list is a subset of another person’s list.
3. **Keep Track of Non-Subset Indices**: If a person’s list is not a subset of any other list, add their index to the result.

### Code
```javascript
var peopleIndexes = function(favoriteCompanies) {
    let n = favoriteCompanies.length;
    let result = [];

    // Convert each list to a set for efficient subset checks
    let companySets = favoriteCompanies.map(companies => new Set(companies));

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let isSubset = false;
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (i !== j && isSubsetOf(companySets[i], companySets[j])) {
                isSubset = true;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (!isSubset) {
            result.push(i);
        }
    }

    return result;

    // Helper function to check if set `a` is a subset of set `b`
    function isSubsetOf(a, b) {
        for (let elem of a) {
            if (!b.has(elem)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
};

// Example usage:
let favoriteCompanies = [
    ["leetcode", "google", "facebook"],
    ["google", "microsoft"],
    ["google", "facebook"],
    ["google"],
    ["amazon"]
];
console.log(peopleIndexes(favoriteCompanies)); // Output: [0, 1, 4]
```

### Time Complexity
- **Converting lists to sets**: O(m), where m is the total number of companies across all lists.
- **Checking subsets**: Checking if one set is a subset of another takes O(k) time for a set size `k`. The nested loop will thus take O(n^2 * k) time in the worst case.
  
Where `n` is the number of lists and `k` is the size of the largest set(list of companies per person).

Thus, the overall time complexity is approximately O(n^2 * k).
