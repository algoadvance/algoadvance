[Leetcode 2526. Find Consecutive Integers from a Data Stream](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2526)
### Problem Statement

LeetCode 2526: **Find Consecutive Integers from a Data Stream**

Given a data stream of integers, design a data structure that supports:

1. **Consecutive(x)**: Checks if the last `x` integers in the stream are consecutive and strictly increasing.

Implement the `DataStream` class:

- `DataStream(int[] arr)`: Constructor which initializes the data stream with the given array `arr`.

- `boolean isConsecutive(int x)`: Returns true if the last `x` numbers in the stream are consecutive and strictly increasing; otherwise returns false.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: What is the maximum length of the data stream?
   **A**: The exact maximum length is not specified, but it should be large enough to test performance efficiently in typical competitive programming constraints.

2. **Q**: If the data stream is shorter than `x`, what should be the output of `isConsecutive(x)`?
   **A**: It should return `false` because there aren't enough elements to make a judgment.

3. **Q**: Are elements in the data stream guaranteed to be integers?
   **A**: Yes, the elements are guaranteed to be integers.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we will:

1. Initialize the `DataStream` class with the given array of integers.
2. Implement the `isConsecutive` method to:
   - Check if the length of the stream is at least `x`.
   - Iterate over the last `x` elements and verify if each element is exactly one greater than the previous element.

### Time Complexity

- The initialization of the data stream takes O(n), where n is the length of the array.
- The `isConsecutive(x)` method takes O(x) time, as it needs to check the last `x` elements each time it is called.

### Code

```javascript
class DataStream {
    constructor(arr) {
        this.stream = arr;
    }

    isConsecutive(x) {
        let n = this.stream.length;
        if (x > n) return false; // not enough elements to check

        for (let i = n - x + 1; i < n; i++) {
            if (this.stream[i] !== this.stream[i - 1] + 1) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }
}

// Example Usage:
// Assume the stream is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
let ds = new DataStream([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]);

console.log(ds.isConsecutive(3));  // true, as last 3 are [3, 4, 5]
console.log(ds.isConsecutive(4));  // true, as last 4 are [2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(ds.isConsecutive(6));  // false, as the stream has only 5 elements
console.log(ds.isConsecutive(2));  // true, as last 2 are [4, 5]
console.log(ds.isConsecutive(1));  // true, single elements are trivially consecutive
``` 

This solution checks the consecutive pattern in the last `x` elements of the stream. It ensures the constraints are followed and provides the correct result based on the input conditions.
