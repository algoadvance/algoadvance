[Leetcode 821. Shortest Distance to a Character](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l821)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and a character `c`, you need to find the shortest distance from each character in the string to the character `c` in the string.

### Example

```
Input: s = "loveleetcode", c = 'e'
Output: [3,2,1,0,1,0,0,1,2,2,1,0]
```

### Note:
1. `s` is a string with length in the range `[1, 10000]`.
2. `c` is a single character that appears at least once in `s`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input string contain spaces or special characters?**
   - Yes, but the function should handle them correctly as part of the string.
2. **Is the input always valid? That is, can we assume that the string `s` is non-empty and the character `c` will always appear at least once in `s`?**
   - Yes, the input is always valid as per the problem statement.

## Strategy

1. **Initialize a Result Array**: Start by creating an array of the same length as `s` initialized with a large number (e.g., Infinity) to hold the distances.
2. **Forward Pass**: Traverse the string from left to right. Whenever the character `c` is encountered, update the distance for that position to `0`. For subsequent characters, calculate the distance from the nearest occurrence of `c` encountered so far.
3. **Backward Pass**: Traverse the string from right to left. Similarly, update the distances by comparing with the nearest occurrence of `c` encountered from the right side.
4. **Return the Result Array**: This array will now contain the shortest distance of each character in `s` to the character `c`.

## Code

```javascript
function shortestToChar(s, c) {
    let n = s.length;
    let result = new Array(n).fill(Infinity);

    // Forward pass
    let prev = -Infinity; // To handle the first character if it's not 'c'
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (s[i] === c) {
            prev = i;
        }
        result[i] = Math.min(result[i], Math.abs(i - prev));
    }

    // Backward pass
    prev = Infinity; // To handle the last character if it's not 'c'
    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (s[i] === c) {
            prev = i;
        }
        result[i] = Math.min(result[i], Math.abs(i - prev));
    }

    return result;
}

// Example usage:
const s = "loveleetcode";
const c = 'e';
console.log(shortestToChar(s, c)); // Output: [3,2,1,0,1,0,0,1,2,2,1,0]
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because we traverse the string twice (once forward and once backward), leading to linear time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This space is used to store the result array.

In terms of efficiency both in time and space, this approach is optimal for the given problem constraints.
