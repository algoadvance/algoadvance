[Leetcode 2013. Detect Squares](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2013)
### Problem Statement

You need to design a data structure that supports the following operations in a 2D plane:

1. `add(point)`: Adds a new point to the data structure.
2. `count(point)`: Counts the number of squares with the given point as one of their corners.

Implement the `DetectSquares` class:

- `DetectSquares()` Initializes the object with an empty data structure.
- `void add(int[] point)` Adds a point `[x, y]` to the data structure.
- `int count(int[] point)` Counts the number of squares with the `point` `[x, y]` as one of the corners.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can there be multiple points with the same coordinates?
   - Yes, multiple points with the same coordinates can exist in the data structure.
   
2. What is the range of the point coordinates?
   - Coordinates are non-negative integers less than 1000.

3. Can points be added multiple times?
   - Yes, points can be added multiple times, and each occurrence should be taken into account.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to keep a record of all points added to the data structure and their counts. For counting the number of squares, we'll:

1. Use a hashmap to store the counts of each point.
2. For `add(point)`, increment the count of the point in the hashmap.
3. For `count(point)`, check for possible opposite corners of squares and calculate the potential numbers of squares based on the stored counts.

### Code

```javascript
class DetectSquares {
    constructor() {
        this.pointsCount = new Map();
    }
    
    add(point) {
        const [x, y] = point;
        const key = `${x},${y}`;
        this.pointsCount.set(key, (this.pointsCount.get(key) || 0) + 1);
    }
    
    count(point) {
        const [x1, y1] = point;
        let totalCount = 0;

        for (const key of this.pointsCount.keys()) {
            const [x2, y2] = key.split(',').map(Number);
            
            if (x1 === x2 || Math.abs(x1 - x2) !== Math.abs(y1 - y2)) {
                continue;
            }
            
            const key1 = `${x1},${y2}`;
            const key2 = `${x2},${y1}`;
            
            totalCount += (this.pointsCount.get(key) || 0) *
                          (this.pointsCount.get(key1) || 0) *
                          (this.pointsCount.get(key2) || 0);
        }

        return totalCount;
    }
}

// Example usage:
const detectSquares = new DetectSquares();
detectSquares.add([3, 10]);
detectSquares.add([11, 2]);
detectSquares.add([3, 2]);
console.log(detectSquares.count([11, 10])); // Output: 1
detectSquares.add([11, 2]);
console.log(detectSquares.count([11, 10])); // Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

- `add(point)`: O(1), because adding a point involves a simple count increment operation.
- `count(point)`: O(N), where N is the number of unique points stored in the hashmap. This is because we potentially have to check all stored points to determine the number of squares.

This solution ensures efficiently handling point additions and reasonably efficient square counting by leveraging spatial relationships in the 2D plane.
