[Leetcode 2058. Find the Minimum and Maximum Number of Nodes Between Critical Points](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2058)
### Problem Statement

You are given the head of a linked list `head`. A node in a linked list is called a **critical point** if it meets either of the following conditions:
- The node is a local maxima: The node has a value strictly greater than the previous node and the next node.
- The node is a local minima: The node has a value strictly smaller than the previous node and the next node.

Return an array containing two integers. The first integer represents the minimum distance between any two critical points, and the second integer represents the maximum distance between any two critical points. If there are fewer than two critical points, return `[-1, -1]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the structure of the linked list node?**
   - The linked list node is defined as follows:
     ```javascript
     function ListNode(val, next) {
         this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
         this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
     }
     ```

2. **Are there any constraints on the values in the linked list?**
   - The values of the linked list nodes are integers and the length of the linked list can be arbitrary.

3. **Can the list have duplicate values?** 
   - Yes, nodes in the linked list can have duplicate values.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Setup**: We need to keep track of the index positions of each critical point we find in the linked list as we iterate through it.
2. **Traverse the List**: Iterate through the list while comparing each node with its previous and next nodes to determine if it is a critical point.
3. **Store Critical Points**: Store the positions of any critical points found.
4. **Compute Distances**: If there are fewer than two critical points, return `[-1, -1]`. Otherwise, compute the minimum and maximum distances between each pair of critical points.
5. **Return the Result**: Return an array containing the minimum and maximum distances.

### Code

```javascript
function ListNode(val, next) {
    this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
    this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next);
}

var nodesBetweenCriticalPoints = function(head) {
    if (!head || !head.next || !head.next.next) {
        return [-1, -1];
    }
    
    let criticalPoints = [];
    let index = 1;
    let prev = head;
    let curr = head.next;
    let next = head.next.next;
    
    while (next) {
        if ((curr.val > prev.val && curr.val > next.val) || (curr.val < prev.val && curr.val < next.val)) {
            criticalPoints.push(index);
        }
        index++;
        prev = curr;
        curr = next;
        next = next.next;
    }
    
    if (criticalPoints.length < 2) {
        return [-1, -1];
    }
    
    let minDistance = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
    let maxDistance = criticalPoints[criticalPoints.length - 1] - criticalPoints[0];
    
    for (let i = 1; i < criticalPoints.length; i++) {
        minDistance = Math.min(minDistance, criticalPoints[i] - criticalPoints[i - 1]);
    }
    
    return [minDistance, maxDistance];
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the linked list.
  - We traverse the linked list once to find the critical points and then iterate over the critical points to calculate distances.
- **Space Complexity**: O(k), where k is the number of critical points found in the list.
  - We store the indices of the critical points, which in the worst case would still be less than the total number of nodes.

This solution efficiently determines the minimum and maximum distances between critical points in a single pass through the linked list, making it both time and space efficient.
