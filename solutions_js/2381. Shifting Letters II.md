[Leetcode 2381. Shifting Letters II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2381)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and a 2D integer array `shifts`, where `shifts[i] = [start_i, end_i, direction_i]`, apply the shift operation to the substring `s[start_i...end_i]` in the following way:

- If `direction_i == 0`, shift all characters to the left (with wrap around) by one position within the substring.
- If `direction_i == 1`, shift all characters to the right (with wrap around) by one position within the substring.

Return the final string after all shift operations have been applied to `s`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the `shifts` array have overlapping ranges?
2. Can the same `shifts` operation be applied multiple times?
3. Are the values of `s` only lowercase alphabetic characters?
4. What is the maximum length for the string `s` and the number of shifts in the array?

### Basic Assumptions from Clarifications

1. Yes, `shifts` can have overlapping ranges.
2. Yes, multiple operations can be applied.
3. Yes, the array contains only lowercase alphabetic characters.
4. Let's assume a manageable size for real-time computations, e.g., `s.length <= 10^4` and `shifts.length <= 10^4`.

### Strategy

1. First, create an array `shiftImpact` of the same length as `s` initialized to 0. This will help us track the net effect of shifts at each position.
2. Process each `shift` and update the `shiftImpact` accordingly:
    - If the direction is left (`0`), increment the start position by `1` and decrement the position right after `end + 1` by `1`.
    - If the direction is right (`1`), decrement the start position by `1` and increment the position right after `end + 1` by `1`.
3. Convert the `shiftImpact` array to prefix sum to get the cumulative shifts at each position.
4. Apply the calculated shifts to the string `s` to get the final result.

### Code

```javascript
function shiftingLetters(s, shifts) {
    const n = s.length;
    const shiftImpact = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    
    shifts.forEach(([start, end, direction]) => {
        if (direction === 0) {
            shiftImpact[start] += 1;
            if (end + 1 < n) shiftImpact[end + 1] -= 1;
        } else {
            shiftImpact[start] -= 1;
            if (end + 1 < n) shiftImpact[end + 1] += 1;
        }
    });

    // Calculate the net shift at each position
    let netShift = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        netShift += Math.abs(shiftImpact[i]);
        shiftImpact[i] = netShift;
    }

    // Apply the shifts to the string
    const result = s.split('').map((char, i) => {
        const shift = shiftImpact[i] % 26;
        const charCode = s.charCodeAt(i);
        const newCharCode = ((charCode - 97 + shift) % 26 + 26) % 26 + 97;
        return String.fromCharCode(newCharCode);
    }).join('');

    return result;
}

// Example usage
const s = "abc";
const shifts = [[0, 1, 0], [1, 2, 1]];
console.log(shiftingLetters(s, shifts)); // Example result expected
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization:** O(n) for initializing `shiftImpact`.
- **Processing Shifts:** O(m) where `m` is the number of shifts.
- **Prefix Sum Calculation:** O(n).
- **Applying Shifts:** O(n).

Total time complexity is O(n + m), which is efficient given the constraints.

### Space Complexity

- Using `O(n)` space for `shiftImpact`.

Hence, overall space complexity is O(n).
