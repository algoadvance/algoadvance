[Leetcode 1526. Minimum Number of Increments on Subarrays to Form a Target Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1526)
### Problem Statement:

You are given an integer array `target`. You want to build an array `target` using the following operation: You start with a `0` array of the same length as `target`. You are allowed to do the following operation as many times as you want:

- Choose any subarray from `0` array and increment each value by 1.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to form `target` array.

**Example:**
```
Input: target = [3,1,5,4]
Output: 5
Explanation: 
Initial i = [0,0,0,0]
operation 1: choose subarray [0:3], increment to [1,1,1,0]
operation 2: choose subarray [0:3], increment to [2,2,2,0]
operation 3: choose subarray [1:2], increment to [2,3,2,0]
operation 4: choose subarray [2:2], increment to [2,3,3,0]
operation 5: choose subarray [0:1], increment to [3,3,3,0]
```

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Can the `target` array contain negative numbers?**
   - Typically, no. The problem usually specifies non-negative integers.

2. **Is there any length constraint for the `target` array?**
   - No specific length constraint is mentioned, but generally, the array length will be reasonable.

3. **Can the `target` array contain zeros?**
   - Yes, zeros are allowed in the `target` array.

### Strategy:

To find the minimum number of operations needed to form the `target` array, consider the following observations:

- Each element in `target` represents how many times it needs to be incremented from 0.
- The most efficient way to achieve the target is by performing increments in larger subarrays as long as all elements in the subarray need the same amount of increments.

Thus, the minimum number of operations required to form the `target` array is essentially determined by the "gaps" or "changes" in heights between successive elements.

### Step-by-Step Approach:

1. Initialize the count of operations to be equal to the first element of the `target` array, as it takes at least those many operations to form the first element.
   
2. Iterate through the `target` array from the second element onward.
   
3. For each element, if it is greater than the previous element, add the difference to the operations count.

### Code Implementation:

```javascript
function minNumberOperations(target) {
    if (target.length === 0) return 0;
    
    // Start with the number of operations equal to the first element
    let operations = target[0];
    
    // Iterate through the array and add the differences
    for (let i = 1; i < target.length; i++) {
        if (target[i] > target[i - 1]) {
            operations += target[i] - target[i - 1];
        }
    }
    
    return operations;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(minNumberOperations([3, 1, 5, 4])); // Output: 6
```

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the `target` array. This is because we only need to iterate through the array once to compute the result, making it efficient even for larger input sizes.
