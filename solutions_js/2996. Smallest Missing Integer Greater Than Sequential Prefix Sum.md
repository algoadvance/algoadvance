[Leetcode 2996. Smallest Missing Integer Greater Than Sequential Prefix Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2996)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers `nums`. You need to determine the smallest missing positive integer greater than the sequential prefix sum of `nums`. The prefix sum of an array is the running total of the elements up to a certain index.

For example, given `nums = [1, 2, 5]`, the prefix sums are `[1, 3, 8]`. You need to find the smallest positive integer greater than each of these prefix sums.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can `nums` contain negative integers?
   - Yes, `nums` can contain both positive and negative integers.
2. Can `nums` be empty?
   - Yes, if `nums` is empty, the expected result should be `1` since there are no prefix sums.
3. Should we consider only positive integers for the result?
   - Yes, we are only interested in positive integers greater than each prefix sum.

## Strategy

1. Calculate the prefix sums of the given `nums` array.
2. Maintain a variable `current` initialized to `1`, representing the smallest missing positive integer.
3. Iterate through the prefix sums:
    - If the `current` is less than the current prefix sum in the iteration, this means we need to increase `current` to be at least one more than the current prefix sum.
4. The value of `current` at the end of the iteration will be the answer.

## Code

```javascript
function smallestMissingInteger(nums) {
    let current = 1;
    let prefixSum = 0;

    for (let num of nums) {
        prefixSum += num;
        if (current <= prefixSum) {
            current = prefixSum + 1;
        }
    }

    return current;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(smallestMissingInteger([1, 2, 5])); // Output: 9
console.log(smallestMissingInteger([-1, -2, -3])); // Output: 1
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the `nums` array. This is because we are iterating through the array once to calculate the prefix sums and determine the smallest missing positive integer.
