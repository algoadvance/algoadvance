[Leetcode 2975. Maximum Square Area by Removing Fences From a Field](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2975)
### Problem Statement

You are given a square field represented by a 2D grid of 1s (fences) and 0s (empty space). Your task is to determine the maximum square area that can be achieved by removing some of the 1s (fences). Note that the field is guaranteed to be a square, and hence the number of rows is equal to the number of columns.

**Example:**
```
Input: grid = [
    [1, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 1]
]
Output: 9
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What is the maximum size of the grid? (For time complexity considerations)
  
2. **Output Expectations:**
    - Should the function return the area of the maximum square?

3. **Edge Cases:**
    - What should the function return if the entire grid is filled with `1`s?
    - What if the grid is completely empty filled with `0`s?

Assuming maximum size constraints and returning area is correct.

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
    - Use a DP table where `dp[i][j]` represents the side length of the maximum square whose bottom-right corner is at `(i, j)`.
    - Traverse through the grid. If the current cell is `0`, set `dp[i][j]` to 0.
    - Otherwise, set `dp[i][j]` equal to the minimum of `dp[i-1][j]`, `dp[i][j-1]`, and `dp[i-1][j-1]` plus one.
    - Maintain a variable to keep track of the maximum side length found during this traversal.
2. **Result Calculation:**
    - Compute the area of the maximum side length found.

### Code

```javascript
function maxSquareArea(grid) {
    let n = grid.length;
    if (n === 0) return 0;
    
    let maxSide = 0;
    let dp = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(0));
    
    // Initialize the dp table and maxSide for the first row and column
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        dp[i][0] = grid[i][0] === 0 ? 1 : 0;
        dp[0][i] = grid[0][i] === 0 ? 1 : 0;
        maxSide = Math.max(maxSide, dp[i][0], dp[0][i]);
    }
    
    // Fill in the rest of the dp table
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === 0) {
                dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1;
                maxSide = Math.max(maxSide, dp[i][j]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // The area of the maximum square found
    return maxSide * maxSide;
}

// Example usage:
let field = [
    [1, 1, 1, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 0, 0, 1],
    [1, 1, 1, 1]
];
console.log(maxSquareArea(field));  // Output: 9
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2), where `n` is the number of rows (or columns) in the grid. This is because we traverse each cell once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n^2) for the DP table used to store the side lengths of the maximum squares.

This solution ensures that we effectively use dynamic programming to solve the problem with optimal time and space complexity.
