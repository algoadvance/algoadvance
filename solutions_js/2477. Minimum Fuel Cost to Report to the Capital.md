[Leetcode 2477. Minimum Fuel Cost to Report to the Capital](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2477)
### Problem Statement

You are given a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph with no cycles) representing cities and roads. The tree has `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1` and is rooted at node `0` (the capital). The tree is given as an array `edges` where `edges[i] = [ai, bi]` represents a bidirectional road connecting nodes `ai` and `bi`. Each city has at most one direct road connecting it to another city.

There is a certain amount of fuel required to go from one node to another (road segment). Your task is to find the minimum fuel cost to bring all citizens to the capital. The requirement is that you have to carry citizens in cars, and each car can carry at most `3` citizens at a time. Each trip from one node to another uses 1 unit of fuel.

Write an efficient algorithm to calculate the minimum fuel cost to bring all citizens to the capital.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size and Constraints:**
   - What are the constraints on the number of nodes `n` and the size of the `edges` array?
   - Is there always a valid tree given as input?

2. **Fuel Cost:**
   - Is the fuel cost per road segment always uniform (i.e., always 1 unit of fuel per road segment)?

3. **Capacity Constraints:**
   - Can a car carry fewer than 3 citizens?

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Do we consider edge cases like an empty tree (which seems to be ruled out by the definition of `n` nodes being greater than or equal to 1)?
  
Based on these assumptions and clarifications, I will proceed to the strategy and code.

### Strategy

1. **Graph Construction:**
   - Construct the adjacency list for the graph given the list of edges.

2. **DFS Traversal:**
   - Use Depth-First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree from the capital (`node 0`).
   - While traversing, count the number of citizens that need to be transported from each subtree to the capital.

3. **Fuel Calculation:**
   - At each node, calculate the minimum number of trips required to transport all citizens from that node to its parent.
   - If a node has `c` citizens and each car can carry `3` citizens, the number of trips required is `ceil(c / 3)`.
   - Sum up the trips and the corresponding fuel cost for transporting citizens from each subtree up to the root.

4. **Handling Edge Cases:**
   - Special care if a node is a leaf node (directly connected to a single other node).

### Code

Here is the implementation:

```javascript
function minimumFuelCost(edges) {
    // Building adjacency list
    const adj = new Map();
    edges.forEach(([u, v]) => {
        if (!adj.has(u)) adj.set(u, []);
        if (!adj.has(v)) adj.set(v, []);
        adj.get(u).push(v);
        adj.get(v).push(u);
    });

    // Helper function for DFS
    function dfs(node, parent) {
        let citizens = 1;  // Starts with 1 (current node citizen)
        let fuelCost = 0;

        for (const neighbor of adj.get(node)) {
            if (neighbor === parent) continue;
            const [subCitizens, subFuelCost] = dfs(neighbor, node);
            citizens += subCitizens;
            fuelCost += subFuelCost + Math.ceil(subCitizens / 3);
        }

        return [citizens, fuelCost];
    }

    // Perform DFS from the root (capital node 0)
    const [, totalFuelCost] = dfs(0, -1);
    return totalFuelCost;
}

// Example usage:
const edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[0,3]];
console.log(minimumFuelCost(edges));  // Output: Depends on the structure
```

### Time Complexity

- **Graph Construction:** `O(n)` because we iterate through each edge once.
- **DFS Traversal:** `O(n)` as we visit each node once and process all adjacent nodes.
  
Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)** where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. This ensures efficient performance for large trees.
