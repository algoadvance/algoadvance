[Leetcode 115. Distinct Subsequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l115)
### Problem Statement

Given two strings `s` and `t`, return the number of distinct subsequences of `s` which equals `t`.

A string's subsequence is a new string formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., "ACE" is a subsequence of "ABCDE" while "AEC" is not).

**Example 1:**
```
Input: s = "rabbbit", t = "rabbit"
Output: 3
Explanation: As shown below, there are 3 ways you can generate "rabbit" from "rabbbit":
```

rabbbit  
rabbbit  
rabbbit  

**Example 2:**
```
Input: s = "babgbag", t = "bag"
Output: 5
Explanation: As shown below, there are 5 ways you can generate "bag" from "babgbag":
```

babgbag  
babgbag  
babgbag  
babgbag  
babgbag  

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum length of the strings `s` and `t`?**
   - The values for `s` and `t` will not exceed 1000 characters.

2. **Are there any constraints on the character set for `s` and `t`?**
   - The strings `s` and `t` will consist of lowercase English letters only.

3. **Do we need to consider case sensitivity?**
   - No, the problem specifies that the strings consist of lowercase English letters only, so case sensitivity is not a concern.

### Strategy

We'll use Dynamic Programming (DP) to solve this problem efficiently. 

**1. Definition of DP Table:**
   - Let `dp[i][j]` represent the number of distinct subsequences of the substring `s[0:i]` which equals the substring `t[0:j]`.

**2. Initialization:**
   - `dp[0][0] = 1`: An empty string `t` is a subsequence of an empty string `s` in exactly 1 way.
   - `dp[i][0] = 1` for any `i`: An empty string `t` is a subsequence of any prefix of `s` in exactly 1 way.

**3. State Transition:**
   - If `s[i-1] == t[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + dp[i-1][j]`. This means we can either:
     - Use the character `s[i-1]` to match `t[j-1]` (contributing `dp[i-1][j-1]` ways).
     - Or exclude the character `s[i-1]` (contributing `dp[i-1][j]` ways).
   - If `s[i-1] != t[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j]`. This means the character `s[i-1]` is not used.

### Code

```javascript
function numDistinct(s, t) {
    const m = s.length;
    const n = t.length;

    // Initialize a 2D DP array with (m+1) x (n+1) dimensions with 0s
    const dp = Array.from({ length: m + 1 }, () => Array(n + 1).fill(0));

    // An empty string t is a subsequence of any prefix of s
    for (let i = 0; i <= m; i++) {
        dp[i][0] = 1;
    }

    for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            // If characters match, sum of two cases
            if (s[i - 1] == t[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + dp[i - 1][j];
            } else {
                // If characters do not match, carry forward the previous value
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j];
            }
        }
    }

    // The number of distinct subsequences of s which equals t
    return dp[m][n];
}
```

### Time Complexity
- The time complexity is **O(m \* n)** where `m` is the length of string `s` and `n` is the length of string `t`.
  
### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is **O(m \* n)** for the DP table.
