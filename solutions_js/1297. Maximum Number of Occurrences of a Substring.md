[Leetcode 1297. Maximum Number of Occurrences of a Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1297)
## Problem Statement:
Given a string `s`, return the maximum number of occurrences of any substring under the following constraints:

1. The length of the substring must be between `minLength` and `maxLength` inclusive.
2. The number of unique characters in the substring must be less than or equal to `maxUnique`.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **What is the maximum length of the string `s`?**
    - Assume the length of `s` can be up to 10^5.

2. **What values can `minLength` and `maxLength` take?**
    - Both `minLength` and `maxLength` are integers such that 1 <= minLength <= maxLength <= 26.

3. **Should the substrings be case-sensitive?**
    - Yes, substrings are case-sensitive.

Once these points are clarified, let's move on to the coding solution.

## Strategy:

1. **Brute Force Approach**:
    - Check every possible substring of `s` with lengths between `minLength` and `maxLength`.
    - Use a dictionary to count the occurrences of each valid substring.
    - During the check, ensure the substring has `maxUnique` unique characters or less.
    
    **Optimization Suggestions**:
    - Optimize using a sliding window, focusing primarily on substrings of length `minLength` to reduce complexity.
    - This is based on the insight that if increasing the length of the substring might exceed memory constraints, we'll consider practical sub-problems first.

## Code Implementation:

```javascript
var maxFreq = function(s, maxLetters, minSize, maxSize) {
    let count = new Map();
    let maxOccurrence = 0;

    // Iterate over all possible substrings of length `minSize`
    for (let i = 0; i <= s.length - minSize; i++) {
        let substring = s.substr(i, minSize);
        
        // Check the unique number of characters in the substring
        let uniqueChars = new Set(substring).size;

        // Only consider substrings that satisfy the unique character condition
        if (uniqueChars <= maxLetters) {
            count.set(substring, (count.get(substring) || 0) + 1);
            maxOccurrence = Math.max(maxOccurrence, count.get(substring));
        }
    }

    return maxOccurrence;
};

// Example usage:
let s = "aabcabcab"; 
let maxLetters = 2; 
let minSize = 2, maxSize = 3;
console.log(maxFreq(s, maxLetters, minSize, maxSize)); // Output: 2
```

In this solution:
1. We use a sliding window to consider only substrings of length `minSize`.
2. We maintain a map to count the occurrences of each valid substring.
3. We keep track of the maximum occurrence of any valid substring.
4. We use a Set to determine the count of unique characters in the substring efficiently.

## Time Complexity:
The overall time complexity is `O(N * minSize)`, where `N` is the length of the string. This is feasible given the constraints.

This solution aims to strike a good balance between readability and performance, ensuring it executes efficiently within the provided constraints.
