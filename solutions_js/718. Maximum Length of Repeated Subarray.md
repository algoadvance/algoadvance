[Leetcode 718. Maximum Length of Repeated Subarray](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l718)
## Problem Statement

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return the maximum length of a subarray that appears in both arrays.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for elements in the input arrays?**
    - Both arrays consist of integers between 0 and 100, inclusive.
2. **What is the length of the input arrays?**
    - The length of each array will be between 1 and 1000.
3. **Are there any restrictions on time or space complexity?**
    - There are no explicit restrictions provided, but an efficient solution is expected since the length can go up to 1000.

## Strategy

This problem is similar to finding the longest common substring between two strings. We can employ dynamic programming to solve it efficiently.

### Dynamic Programming Approach

1. **Initialize a 2D DP Table:** 
   - Create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest common subarray ending with `nums1[i-1]` and `nums2[j-1]`.
   
2. **Fill the DP Table:**
   - If `nums1[i-1] == nums2[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1`
   - Otherwise, `dp[i][j] = 0`
   
3. **Track the Maximum Length:** 
   - As we fill the `dp` table, keep track of the maximum length found.

### Algorithm Implementation

1. **Initialize the DP table with zeros.**
2. **Iterate over both arrays to fill the DP table based on the conditions stated above.**
3. **Keep updating the maximum length encountered.**

### Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(m * n)` where `m` is the length of `nums1` and `n` is the length of `nums2`. We iterate through each possible pair of indices once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(m * n)` for the DP table.

Now let's write the JavaScript implementation:

## Code
```javascript
function findLength(nums1, nums2) {
    let m = nums1.length;
    let n = nums2.length;
    let dp = Array.from(Array(m + 1), () => Array(n + 1).fill(0));
    let maxLength = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i <= m; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= n; j++) {
            if (nums1[i - 1] === nums2[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1] + 1;
                maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, dp[i][j]);
            }
        }
    }

    return maxLength;
}

// Example usage:
let nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 2, 1];
let nums2 = [3, 2, 1, 4, 7];
console.log(findLength(nums1, nums2));  // Output: 3
```

The above implementation correctly uses dynamic programming to solve the problem, efficiently determining the maximum length of a subarray that appears in both input arrays.
