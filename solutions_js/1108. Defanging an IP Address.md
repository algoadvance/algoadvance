[Leetcode 1108. Defanging an IP Address](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1108)
## Problem Statement

Given a valid (IPv4) IP `address`, return a defanged version of that IP address.

A defanged IP address replaces every period `.` with `[.]`.

### Example 1:
```
Input: address = "1.1.1.1"
Output: "1[.]1[.]1[.]1"
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: address = "255.100.50.0"
Output: "255[.]100[.]50[.]0"
```

### Constraints:
- The given `address` is a valid IPv4 address.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Will the input always be in the form of a valid IPv4 address?**
   Yes, as specified in the problem constraints, the input will always be a valid IPv4 address.

2. **Is the operation simply replacing all `.` characters with `[.]`?**
   Yes, the task is to replace all periods `.` with `[.]`.

## Strategy

1. **String Replacement:**
   We will use JavaScript's `replace` method to replace all occurrences of `.` with `[.]`.

## Code

Here's the code to solve the problem:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} address
 * @return {string}
 */
var defangIPaddr = function(address) {
    return address.split('.').join('[.]');
};

// Test cases
console.log(defangIPaddr("1.1.1.1"));  // Output: "1[.]1[.]1[.]1"
console.log(defangIPaddr("255.100.50.0"));  // Output: "255[.]100[.]50[.]0"
```

## Strategy

- The `split` method splits the string into an array of substrings using the period `.` as the delimiter.
- The `join` method then combines these substrings using `[.]` as the separator.
- This approach effectively replaces each period with `[.]`.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the input string. This is because both the `split` and `join` methods process each character of the string once.

This approach ensures that we efficiently and correctly obtain the defanged version of the IP address.
