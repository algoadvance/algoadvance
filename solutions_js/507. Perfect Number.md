[Leetcode 507. Perfect Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l507)
### Problem Statement
A **perfect number** is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. For example, 28 is a perfect number because its divisors are 1, 2, 4, 7, 14, and 28. Excluding 28, the sum of these divisors is 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28.

Given an integer `num`, write a function that returns `true` if `num` is a perfect number, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What are the constraints on the input number (`num`)?
   - Generally, `1 <= num <= 10^8`.
2. Should the solution handle negative numbers or just positive numbers as the problem suggests dealing only with positive integers?
   - The problem specifies positive integers.

### Strategy
1. **Initial Check**:
   - If `num` is 1, immediately return `false` because 1 is not a perfect number.
   
2. **Finding Divisors**:
   - Iterate through potential divisors from 1 to the square root of `num`. For each divisor `i`:
     - If `i` is a divisor of `num`, add `i` and `num / i` to the sum of divisors.
     - Ensure not to add `num` itself and avoid adding the same divisor twice when `i` is the square root of `num`.

3. **Sum Calculation**:
   - Maintain a running total of divisors excluding `num` and compare with `num`.

4. **Return Result**:
   - Return `true` if the sum of divisors equals `num`, otherwise return `false`.

### Code

```javascript
function checkPerfectNumber(num) {
    if (num === 1) {
        return false;
    }

    let sum = 1;  // Start with 1, as 1 is a divisor of every number
    for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) {
        if (num % i === 0) {
            if (i * i !== num) {
                sum += i + num / i;
            } else {
                sum += i;
            }
        }
    }

    return sum === num;
}

// Test cases to verify the solution
console.log(checkPerfectNumber(28));  // Output: true
console.log(checkPerfectNumber(6));   // Output: true
console.log(checkPerfectNumber(496)); // Output: true
console.log(checkPerfectNumber(12));  // Output: false
console.log(checkPerfectNumber(1));   // Output: false
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(âˆšn)` because the loop runs from 2 to the square root of `num` to check for divisors. This is efficient for large values of `num` up to \(10^8\).
