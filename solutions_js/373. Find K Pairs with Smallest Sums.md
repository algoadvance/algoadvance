[Leetcode 373. Find K Pairs with Smallest Sums](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l373)
### Problem Statement

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` sorted in **ascending order**, and an integer `k`, return *the* `k` *pairs* `(u, v)` *which consist of one element from* `nums1` *and one element from* `nums2` *such that the sum* `u + v` *is the smallest possible*.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What happens if one of the input arrays is empty?**
   - If either `nums1` or `nums2` is empty, we should return an empty list since there are no pairs to form.
   
2. **What if k is larger than the total possible pairs of elements from `nums1` and `nums2`?**
   - If `k` is larger than the total number of possible pairs (`len(nums1) * len(nums2)`), we should return all possible pairs sorted by their sums.

3. **Can there be negative integers in the input arrays?**
   - Yes, there can be negative integers in the input arrays.

### Strategy

To efficiently find the pairs with the smallest sums, we can make use of a min-heap. The general steps of the algorithm are as follows:

1. **Initialize a Min-Heap**: Use a min-heap to always extract the next smallest sum pair.
2. **Push Initial Pairs**: Initially push pairs formed by the first element of `nums1` with every element of `nums2` into the heap.
3. **Extract k Pairs**: Iteratively extract the smallest sum pair from the heap and push the next possible pair from `nums1` into the heap.

We'll use a combination of the heap for efficiency and a set to keep track of pairs we have already considered to avoid duplicates.

### Code

```javascript
function kSmallestPairs(nums1, nums2, k) {
    // Edge case: if either array is empty, return an empty list
    if (!nums1.length || !nums2.length) return [];
    
    const minHeap = [];
    const result = [];
    const visited = new Set();

    // Helper function to push pairs into the heap
    function push(i, j) {
        if (i < nums1.length && j < nums2.length && !visited.has(`${i},${j}`)) {
            minHeap.push([nums1[i] + nums2[j], i, j]);
            // Use Min Heap property
            // We push negative sums into the heap so we can use a max heap behavior of JavaScript heap
            minHeap.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
            visited.add(`${i},${j}`);
        }
    }

    // Initialize heap with the first row of pairs
    for (let j = 0; j < Math.min(nums2.length, k); j++) {
        push(0, j);
    }

    while (result.length < k && minHeap.length) {
        const [sum, i, j] = minHeap.shift();
        result.push([nums1[i], nums2[j]]);
        push(i + 1, j);
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution primarily involves the push and pop operations on the heap:
- **Heap Operations**: Each `push` and `shift` (extract-min) operation on a heap takes `O(log N)` time where `N` is the current size of the heap.
- **Initialization**: Initializing the heap takes `O(M log M)` where `M` is the smaller value of `len(nums2)` and `k`.
- **Total Complexity**: Since we perform up to `k` operations of extracting and pushing new elements into the heap, the worst-case time complexity is `O(k log M)` where `M` is the maximum size of the heap at any point in time.

### Conclusion

The provided solution efficiently finds the `k` pairs with the smallest sums using a min-heap, and handles edge cases where input arrays could be empty or `k` is larger than the possible number of pairs. The algorithm is designed to handle cases efficiently within the constraints provided.
