[Leetcode 1096. Brace Expansion II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1096)
## Problem Statement:

Given a string expression representing a list of words separated by commas, and which may contain braces `{}`, return all possible words that can be formed from the string expression.

### Important Points:
- The input string can have portions of text enclosed within braces `{}`. 
- Commas `,` denote separate variations, while concatenation implies combining parts inside braces in all possible ways.

For example, the expression `{a,b}{c,d}` would generate the results `ac`, `ad`, `bc`, `bd`.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q:** Are there nested braces allowed in the expression?
   - **A:** Yes, braces can be nested.

2. **Q:** Should the resulting list be unique and sorted?
   - **A:** Yes, the result should contain unique words and be sorted lexicographically.

3. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the length of the expression?
   - **A:** Although unspecified, the problem typically assumes that the input can be reasonably handled within typical limits of competitive programming.

## Strategy:

To solve this problem, we need to handle nested braces and the operations they imply (union and concatenation). Here's a breakdown of the steps:

1. **Parsing the Expression**: We'll need to parse the string to identify groups and individual words.
2. **Recursive Processing**: Using a recursive approach, we can handle nested braces. Each recursive call should process the smallest valid portion of the string.
3. **Combining Results**: Utilize sets to ensure unique entries and combine results based on concatenation or union operations.

### Detailed Steps:

1. **Parsing**:
   - Use a stack to manage nested levels of braces.
   - Identify substrings to work with recursively.
   
2. **Recursive Expansion**:
   - Process each group (inside braces and outside) to find all combinations.
   
3. **Union and Concatenation**:
   - Combine sets produced from the recursive steps.

## Implementation:

```javascript
function braceExpansionII(expression) {
    // Helper function to perform the union of two sets
    const union = (set1, set2) => {
        const resultSet = new Set(set1);
        for (const item of set2) {
            resultSet.add(item);
        }
        return resultSet;
    };

    // Helper function to perform the cartesian product (concatenation) of two sets
    const cartesianProduct = (set1, set2) => {
        if (set1.size === 0) return set2;
        if (set2.size === 0) return set1;
        const resultSet = new Set();
        for (const item1 of set1) {
            for (const item2 of set2) {
                resultSet.add(item1 + item2);
            }
        }
        return resultSet;
    };

    const parseExpression = (exp) => {
        const stack = [];
        let currentSet = new Set();

        for (let i = 0; i < exp.length; i++) {
            if (exp[i] === '{') {
                stack.push(currentSet);
                stack.push(',');
                currentSet = new Set();
            } else if (exp[i] === '}') {
                let combinedSet = currentSet;
                while (stack.length && stack[stack.length - 1] !== ',') {
                    combinedSet = union(stack.pop(), combinedSet);
                }
                stack.pop(); // Remove the ',' marker
                if (stack.length) {
                    currentSet = cartesianProduct(stack.pop(), combinedSet);
                } else {
                    currentSet = combinedSet;
                }
            } else if (exp[i] === ',') {
                stack.push(currentSet);
                currentSet = new Set();
            } else {
                let j = i;
                while (j < exp.length && /[a-zA-Z]/.test(exp[j])) j++;
                const word = exp.slice(i, j);
                const tempSet = new Set([word]);
                currentSet = cartesianProduct(currentSet, tempSet);
                i = j - 1;
            }
        }

        while (stack.length) {
            currentSet = union(stack.pop(), currentSet);
        }

        return Array.from(currentSet).sort();
    };

    return parseExpression(expression);
}

// Example usage:
// console.log(braceExpansionII('{a,b}{c,d}'));
```

## Time Complexity:
- Parsing and handling nested expressions might require a traversal of the string, resulting in a time complexity of O(n * m), where `n` is the length of the expression, and `m` represents possible combinations generated at each level, due to the union and cartesian product operations. However, the code is optimized to handle the strings within reasonable constraints efficiently. 

Feel free to test different cases to ensure all edge cases (like nested braces and multiple segments) are covered properly.
