[Leetcode 649. Dota2 Senate](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l649)
## Problem Statement

The Dota2 game has two parties: the Radiant and the Dire. The Dota2 senate consists of senators who can ban each other. Each senator can exercise one of two rights:

- Ban one senator of the opposing party.
- Declare victory if all the opposing senators are banned.

Given a string `senate` representing all senators and their parties, where 'R' represents a Radiant senator and 'D' represents a Dire senator, determine which party will declare victory.

The banning rules are as follows:
1. Each round, each senator executes one ban in the order given in the input string.
2. Once all senators have executed their banning rights and some senators are still left, the process repeats with the remaining senators, maintaining their relative order.

**Example:**

```
Input: senate = "RDD"
Output: "Dire"
Explanation: 
The first senator R bans the first senator D, then the second senator D bans the senator R, and finally the last senator D declares the victory.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can we assume the input string will always be valid and non-empty?
   - Yes.
2. Is there a fixed upper limit on the length of the input string?
   - No fixed upper limit, but it will fit within standard constraints.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use two queues to keep track of the indices of Radiant senators and Dire senators. By using their indices, we can determine the order of bans effectively. The process involves these steps:

1. Traverse the input string and enqueue indices of 'R' in one queue and 'D' in another queue.
2. Process each round by comparing the front of both queues. The senator with the smaller index bans the other, and the winner's index is pushed back into the queue but updated with a new index equivalent to current index + length of the string (mimicking the cyclic behavior).
3. Continue this process until one of the queues is empty.
4. The non-empty queue will determine the winning party.

## Code

```javascript
function predictPartyVictory(senate) {
    const radiant = [];
    const dire = [];
    const n = senate.length;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (senate[i] === 'R') {
            radiant.push(i);
        } else {
            dire.push(i);
        }
    }

    while (radiant.length > 0 && dire.length > 0) {
        let r_index = radiant.shift();
        let d_index = dire.shift();
        if (r_index < d_index) {
            radiant.push(r_index + n);
        } else {
            dire.push(d_index + n);
        }
    }

    return radiant.length > 0 ? "Radiant" : "Dire";
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization:** O(n), where n is the length of the input string, for populating the two queues.
- **Processing:** Each senator is processed once for each round, and each subsequent round reduces the number of senators that need to be processed.
  - If k rounds are required, each round involves processing each senator once, so overall complexity is linear in terms of the number of senators processed through all rounds. Thus it can be approximated as O(n).
  
Overall, since each senator is processed once per round and the number of senators reduces each round, the total time complexity is O(n).

The space complexity is O(n) for storing the indices in the two queues.
