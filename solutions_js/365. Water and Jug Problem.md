[Leetcode 365. Water and Jug Problem](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l365)
### Problem Statement

You are given two jugs with capacities `jug1Capacity` and `jug2Capacity`. There is an infinite amount of water supply available. Design an algorithm to determine whether it is possible to measure exactly `targetCapacity` liters using these two jugs.

You can perform the following operations:
1. Fill any of the jugs to its full capacity.
2. Empty any of the jugs.
3. Pour water from one jug into another jug until one of the jugs is either empty or full.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: jug1Capacity = 3, jug2Capacity = 5, targetCapacity = 4
Output: true
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: jug1Capacity = 2, jug2Capacity = 6, targetCapacity = 5
Output: false
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: jug1Capacity = 1, jug2Capacity = 2, targetCapacity = 3
Output: true
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the jugs be filled or emptied fully or partially?**
   - You are allowed to fill or empty the jugs to their full capacities but not partially.
   
2. **Can `targetCapacity` be greater than the total capacity of both jugs combined?**
   - If `targetCapacity` is greater than the sum of both `jug1Capacity` and `jug2Capacity`, it is impossible to measure that amount.

3. **Do negative values and zero need to be handled in inputs?**
   - No negative values will be handled. The `targetCapacity` can be zero implying both jugs could be empty as a valid solution.

### Strategy

This problem can be solved using mathematical observations rather than just trying to simulate every possibility, which can be computationally prohibitive. The core insight is based on BÃ©zout's Identity. It states that for two integers `a` and `b`, the equation `ax + by = d` has a solution if and only if `d` is a multiple of the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `a` and `b`.

Using this idea, the problem can be reduced to checking if `targetCapacity` is a multiple of the `gcd(jug1Capacity, jug2Capacity)`, and it should also be less than or equal to `jug1Capacity + jug2Capacity`.

### Code

Here's the JavaScript implementation of the solution:

```javascript
function canMeasureWater(jug1Capacity, jug2Capacity, targetCapacity) {
    function gcd(a, b) {
        while (b !== 0) {
            let temp = b;
            b = a % b;
            a = temp;
        }
        return a;
    }

    if (targetCapacity > jug1Capacity + jug2Capacity) {
        return false;
    }

    if (targetCapacity === 0) {
        return true;
    }

    return targetCapacity % gcd(jug1Capacity, jug2Capacity) === 0;
}

// Example test cases
console.log(canMeasureWater(3, 5, 4)); // true
console.log(canMeasureWater(2, 6, 5)); // false
console.log(canMeasureWater(1, 2, 3)); // true
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is primarily due to the calculation of the gcd, which is O(log(min(jug1Capacity, jug2Capacity))). All other operations (like comparisons and modulus operations) are constant time, O(1).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is:
- **O(log(min(jug1Capacity, jug2Capacity)))**

This ensures the solution is efficient even for larger values of `jug1Capacity` and `jug2Capacity`.
