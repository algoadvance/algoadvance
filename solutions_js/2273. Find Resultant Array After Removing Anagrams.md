[Leetcode 2273. Find Resultant Array After Removing Anagrams](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2273)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed string array `words`, where `words[i]` consists of lowercase English letters. In one operation, select any index `i` such that `0 < i < words.length` and `words[i - 1]` and `words[i]` are anagrams, and delete `words[i]` from `words`. Keep performing this operation as long as you can select an index that satisfies the conditions.

Return `words` after performing all operations. It can be shown that selecting the indices for each operation in any arbitrary order will lead to the same result.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - How large can the array `words` be?
   - Can each word contain a large number of characters?

2. **Output Requirements:**
   - Should the output maintain the original relative order of the words, excluding the ones removed as anagrams?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, the main idea is to iterate through the list of words and remove consecutive anagrams.

1. **Check for Anagrams:** Two words are anagrams if sorting their characters results in the same string. So for each pair of consecutive words, we can check if they are anagrams by comparing their sorted versions.
2. **Iterate and Compare:**
   - Start with an empty result list.
   - Iterate through the `words` list.
   - For each word, compare it with the last word in the result list.
   - If they are anagrams, skip the current word.
   - If they are not anagrams, add the current word to the result list.

### Code

Here is the JavaScript code to solve the problem:

```javascript
function findResultantArray(words) {
    // Function to check if two words are anagrams
    function areAnagrams(word1, word2) {
        return word1.split('').sort().join('') === word2.split('').sort().join('');
    }
    
    const result = [];
    for (let word of words) {
        if (result.length === 0 || !areAnagrams(result[result.length - 1], word)) {
            result.push(word);
        }
    }
    return result;
}

// Example usage:
const words = ["abba", "baba", "bbaa", "cd", "cd"];
console.log(findResultantArray(words));  // Output: ["abba", "cd"]
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Anagram Check Complexity:**
   - Sorting each word takes `O(k log k)`, where `k` is the length of the word.
   - Checking if two words are anagrams, therefore, is `O(k log k)`.

2. **Overall Complexity:**
   - Suppose there are `n` words in the list.
   - In the worst case, we check `n-1` pairs of words.
   - Each check involves sorting, so the total time complexity is `O(n * k log k)`.

Here, `n` is the number of words, and `k` is the maximum length of a word in the array `words`.
