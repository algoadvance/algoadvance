[Leetcode 558. Logical OR of Two Binary Grids Represented as Quad](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l558)
### Problem Statement

We are given the root nodes of two Quad-Trees, `quadTree1` and `quadTree2`, each representing a `n x n` boolean grid. 

Each Node in the Quad-Tree has the following fields:
- `val`: a boolean, representing whether all the grid cells in the area represented by the node have a value of 1.
- `isLeaf`: a boolean, indicating whether the node is a leaf node.

If the node is not a leaf, it has four children:
- `topLeft`: the top-left quarter of the grid.
- `topRight`: the top-right quarter of the grid.
- `bottomLeft`: the bottom-left quarter of the grid.
- `bottomRight`: the bottom-right quarter of the grid.

Our task is to implement a function that returns the root of a Quad-Tree representing the logical OR of the two given Quad-Trees.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can the grids be non-square?
   - No, it is given that the boolean grid is always a square grid.
2. Can the size of the grids be different for the two trees?
   - No, it is implied that both Quad-Trees represent `n x n` boolean grids of the same size.
3. What is the expected size of the grid (maximum value for `n`)?
   - This isn't specified, but it will be bounded by practical limits.

### Strategy
The Quad-Tree representation suggests that if a node is a leaf, it represents a uniform area in the grid (all `0`s or all `1`s). If not a leaf, its children represent smaller subgrids.

1. If either of the current nodes (`quadTree1` or `quadTree2`) is a leaf and has a value of `1`, the result for this segment should be a leaf node with a value of `1`.
2. If both nodes are leaves and their values are `0`, the result is a leaf node with a value of `0`.
3. If neither node is a leaf, perform recurrence for each of the four sub-regions.
4. If the OR operation between the four children of the resulting quad tree results in a uniform value (`all 0s` or `all 1s`), return a leaf node accordingly.
5. Otherwise, return a non-leaf node with the computed children.

### Code
Here is the JavaScript implementation of the described strategy:

```javascript
function Node(val, isLeaf, topLeft, topRight, bottomLeft, bottomRight) {
  return { val, isLeaf, topLeft, topRight, bottomLeft, bottomRight };
}

function intersect(quadTree1, quadTree2) {
  if (quadTree1.isLeaf) {
    if (quadTree1.val) {
      return new Node(true, true, null, null, null, null);
    }
    return quadTree2;
  }
  if (quadTree2.isLeaf) {
    if (quadTree2.val) {
      return new Node(true, true, null, null, null, null);
    }
    return quadTree1;
  }

  let topLeft = intersect(quadTree1.topLeft, quadTree2.topLeft);
  let topRight = intersect(quadTree1.topRight, quadTree2.topRight);
  let bottomLeft = intersect(quadTree1.bottomLeft, quadTree2.bottomLeft);
  let bottomRight = intersect(quadTree1.bottomRight, quadTree2.bottomRight);

  if (topLeft.isLeaf && topRight.isLeaf && bottomLeft.isLeaf && bottomRight.isLeaf &&
      topLeft.val === topRight.val &&
      topRight.val === bottomLeft.val &&
      bottomLeft.val === bottomRight.val) {
    return new Node(topLeft.val, true, null, null, null, null);
  }
  
  return new Node(false, false, topLeft, topRight, bottomLeft, bottomRight);
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(N)` where `N` is the number of nodes in the quad-tree. The reason is that in the worst case, we traversal all nodes of both quad-trees to combine them using the logical OR operation. Each node is processed once.
