[Leetcode 58. Length of Last Word](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l58)
### Problem Statement
Given a string `s` consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string. A word is defined as a maximal substring consisting of non-space characters only.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input string have leading or trailing spaces?**
   - Yes, the string can have leading or trailing spaces.

2. **What should be returned if the string is empty or contains only spaces?**
   - For an empty string or a string with only spaces, the length of the last word should be 0.

3. **Are words separated by single or multiple spaces?**
   - Words can be separated by multiple spaces.

### Strategy

1. **Trim the Input:**
   - Use JavaScript's `trim()` method to remove any leading or trailing spaces from the input string.

2. **Split the String:**
   - Split the trimmed string by spaces to get all words into an array.

3. **Get the Last Word:**
   - The last element of the array is the last word in the string.

4. **Calculate Length:**
   - Return the length of the last word.

### Code

Here's the JavaScript implementation of the strategy outlined:

```javascript
function lengthOfLastWord(s) {
    // Trim the input string to remove leading and trailing spaces
    let trimmedStr = s.trim();
    
    // Split the string on spaces to get all the words
    let words = trimmedStr.split(' ');
    
    // Get the last word in the array
    let lastWord = words[words.length - 1];
    
    // Return the length of the last word
    return lastWord.length;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Trimming the String:** The `trim()` operation takes O(n) time where n is the length of the string.
- **Splitting the String:** The `split()` operation also takes O(n) time.
- **Accessing the Last Element:** Accessing the last element of an array is an O(1) operation.
- **Calculating Length:** Calculating the length of the last word is O(1).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n).

This approach is efficient and clear, ensuring that we handle all edge cases as well.
