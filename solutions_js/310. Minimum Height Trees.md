[Leetcode 310. Minimum Height Trees](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l310)
### Problem Statement

Given a connected, undirected graph with n nodes labeled from 0 to n - 1, and an array of edges where each `edges[i] = [a_i, b_i]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between `a_i` and `b_i`. Find all the nodes that can be considered as "Minimum Height Trees" (MHTs). An MHT is defined as a tree whose height is minimized among all possible trees.

You need to return a list of all such root nodes. If there are multiple answers, return them in any order. The height of a tree is the number of edges on the longest path between any two nodes in the tree.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of `n` and `edges` length?**
   - Typically, we can expect `n` to be in the range of 1 to 10,000.
   
2. **Can the graph have cycles?**
   - No, the graph is a tree itself hence acyclic and connected.
   
3. **What should be returned if `n == 1`?**
   - Return `[0]` as there's only one node which is obviously the root for the only MHT.

### Strategy

1. **Observation**:
   - Leaves are nodes with only one connection.
   - MHTs are centered at the middle of the longest path in the tree. For a given tree, this usually means we approach the problem by trimming leaves level by level until 1-2 nodes remain, which will be the centers of the tree.

2. **BFS/Topological Sort Approach**:
   - First, identify all leaf nodes (nodes with only one connection).
   - Iteratively remove leaves and update the degrees of remaining nodes.
   - Continue this process until 1 or 2 nodes remain. These nodes will be the roots of MHTs.

3. **Steps**:
   - Create an adjacency list for the graph.
   - Initialize leaves.
   - Use BFS to trim leaves iteratively.
   - Return the remaining 1 or 2 nodes.

### Code

```javascript
function findMinHeightTrees(n, edges) {
    if (n < 2) {
        // Base case: single node or empty node graph
        return [...Array(n).keys()];
    }
    
    // Create an adjacency list
    const adjList = Array.from({length: n}, () => []);
    for (const [start, end] of edges) {
        adjList[start].push(end);
        adjList[end].push(start);
    }
    
    // Initialize leaves
    let leaves = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (adjList[i].length === 1) {
            leaves.push(i);
        }
    }
    
    // Remove leaves level by level
    let remainingNodes = n;
    while (remainingNodes > 2) {
        remainingNodes -= leaves.length;
        const newLeaves = [];
        
        while (leaves.length > 0) {
            const leaf = leaves.pop();
            const neighbor = adjList[leaf].pop();  // Get the only neighbor
            adjList[neighbor] = adjList[neighbor].filter(node => node !== leaf);  // Remove leaf from neighbor
            if (adjList[neighbor].length === 1) {
                newLeaves.push(neighbor);
            }
        }
        
        leaves = newLeaves;
    }
    
    return leaves;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Building the adjacency list**: `O(n + e)` where `e` is the number of edges.
- **Removing leaves**: Each node is processed once; thus, itâ€™s also `O(n + e)`.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n)`, making the solution efficient for large values of `n` up to 10,000.
