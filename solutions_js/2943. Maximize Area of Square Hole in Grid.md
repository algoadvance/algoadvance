[Leetcode 2943. Maximize Area of Square Hole in Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2943)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D grid of integers. Each cell in the grid can either be empty (represented by 0) or contain an obstacle (represented by 1). Your task is to find the largest area of a square hole (formed by 0s) that can be placed anywhere in the grid without overlapping any 1s. Determine the area of the largest square in the grid that consists entirely of 0s.

**Example:**
- Input: `grid = [[1,0,1],[1,0,1],[1,0,0]]`
- Output: `1`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are we guaranteed that the input grid will not be empty?**
   - Yes, assume input will always be a non-empty 2D grid.
2. **Can the grid contain any values other than 0 and 1?**
   - No, the grid will only contain 0s and 1s.
3. **Are we only interested in the largest square area?**
   - Yes, we need to return the area of the largest possible square formed by 0s.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use Dynamic Programming (DP):

1. **Define a DP table** `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the side length of the largest square whose bottom-right corner is at cell `(i, j)` in the grid.
2. **Base conditions**:
   - If `grid[i][j] == 0`, we need to determine the largest square that can end at `(i, j)`.
   - If `grid[i][j] == 1`, `dp[i][j]` must be 0 because a square cannot end at an obstacle.
3. **State transition**:
   - If `grid[i][j] == 0`, the cell can be part of a square. The side length will be the minimum of the values from the left, top, and top-left diagonal cells plus 1:
     ```javascript
     dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1
     ```
4. **Result computation**:
   - Track the maximum side length found while filling up the `dp` table.
   - The area of the largest square will be this side length squared.

### Code

```javascript
function maximalSquare(grid) {
    if (!grid.length || !grid[0].length) return 0;

    const rows = grid.length;
    const cols = grid[0].length;
    let maxSide = 0;

    // Initialize the DP table with 0s
    const dp = new Array(rows).fill(0).map(() => new Array(cols).fill(0));

    for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] == 0) {
                if (i == 0 || j == 0) {
                    dp[i][j] = 1; // First row or column squares are valid if they are 0
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1], dp[i-1][j-1]) + 1;
                }
                maxSide = Math.max(maxSide, dp[i][j]);
            }
        }
    }

    // The area of the largest square is side length squared
    return maxSide * maxSide;
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(rows * cols)**, where `rows` is the number of rows in the grid and `cols` is the number of cells in each row. This is because we iterate over each cell once and perform constant-time operations for each cell.

The space complexity is also **O(rows * cols)** for storing the `dp` table.
