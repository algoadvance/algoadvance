[Leetcode 130. Surrounded Regions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l130)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D board containing `'X'` and `'O'`. Capture all regions surrounded by `'X'`. A region is captured by flipping all `'O'`s into `'X'`s in that surrounded region.

A region is considered to be surrounded if all the `'O'`s in that region are surrounded by `'X'`es either horizontally or vertically.

#### Example:

```plaintext
Input: board = [["X", "X", "X", "X"],
                ["X", "O", "O", "X"],
                ["X", "X", "O", "X"],
                ["X", "O", "X", "X"]]

Output: [["X", "X", "X", "X"],
        ["X", "X", "X", "X"],
        ["X", "X", "X", "X"],
        ["X", "O", "X", "X"]]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints on the board dimensions?**
   - The board will have at least one row and one column.
   
2. **Is it guaranteed that the board will only contain `'X'` and `'O'` characters?**
   - Yes, only `'X'` and `'O'` characters will be present.

3. **Can regions have irregular shapes, or are they always a rectangular section?**
   - Regions can have irregular shapes as they are defined by contiguous `'O'`s.

### Strategy

1. **Boundary Traversal:**
   - Traverse the boundary of the board and perform DFS/BFS to mark all `'O'`s that are connected to the boundary and hence cannot be flipped. We will use a temporary marker (e.g., `'#'`).

2. **Flip Sections:**
   - Traverse the board again and flip all remaining `'O'`s to `'X'` and revert `'#'` back to `'O'`.

### Code

```javascript
function solve(board) {
    if (board.length === 0) return;
    const rows = board.length;
    const cols = board[0].length;
    
    // Helper function to mark boundary-connected 'O's as '#'
    function dfs(r, c) {
        if (r < 0 || r >= rows || c < 0 || c >= cols || board[r][c] !== 'O') return;
        board[r][c] = '#';
        const directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]];
        for (let [dr, dc] of directions) {
            dfs(r + dr, c + dc);
        }
    }
    
    // Step 1: Mark all 'O's connected to the boundary with '#'
    for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
        dfs(r, 0);
        dfs(r, cols - 1);
    }
    for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
        dfs(0, c);
        dfs(rows - 1, c);
    }
    
    // Step 2: Flip all 'O' to 'X', then '#' back to 'O'
    for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
        for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
            if (board[r][c] === 'O') {
                board[r][c] = 'X';
            } else if (board[r][c] === '#') {
                board[r][c] = 'O';
            }
        }
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(m * n)
  - We traverse the entire board a constant number of times.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(m * n) in the worst case due to the recursion stack for DFS.

This approach ensures that we capture all surrounded regions accurately, taking care of edge-connected regions properly.
