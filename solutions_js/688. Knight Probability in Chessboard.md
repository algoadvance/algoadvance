[Leetcode 688. Knight Probability in Chessboard](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l688)
### Problem Statement:

The problem is to calculate the probability that a knight remains on an `n x n` chessboard after making `k` moves, starting from a given position `(row, column)`.

The knight moves in an "L" shape: it can move two squares in one direction and one square in a perpendicular direction. Given these movements, it has up to 8 possible moves from any position.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What is the range of `n`, `k`, `row`, and `column`?**
   - **Answer:** Typically, `1 <= n <= 25`, `0 <= k <= 100`, and the initial position `(row, column)` is within the dimensions of the board `[0, n-1]`.

2. **What should be returned if the knight is already off the board at the initial position?**
   - **Answer:** This scenario is not applicable since the initial position is always within bounds by definition.

3. **Are any special considerations needed for time or space complexity?**
   - **Answer:** The solution should efficiently handle the upper limits (like `n=25`, `k=100`), necessitating considerations for both time and space.

### Strategy:

The approach involves dynamic programming (DP) to keep track of the probabilities that the knight is on each square of the board after a given number of moves. We can use two DP tables, toggling between them to save space.

1. **Initialize the DP tables:**
   - `dp0` and `dp1` tables to represent the probability distributions for even and odd moves respectively.
   - Initially, `dp0` is set to 1 for the starting position (`row`, `column`) and 0 for all other positions.

2. **Populate the DP tables:**
   - Repeat for `k` moves:
     - For each cell, calculate the probability of moving to each of the 8 possible positions.
     - Update probabilities in the other DP table.

3. **Sum the probabilities:**
   - After `k` moves, sum the probabilities of all valid positions.

### Time Complexity:
- The DP solution should be `O(n^2 * k * 8)`, simplifying to `O(n^2 * k)`, due to the requirement to process each cell for each move and considering 8 possible moves per cell.

### Code:

```javascript
var knightProbability = function(n, k, row, column) {
    const directions = [
        [2, 1], [2, -1], [-2, 1], [-2, -1],
        [1, 2], [1, -2], [-1, 2], [-1, -2]
    ];
    
    let dp0 = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(0));
    let dp1 = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(0));
    
    dp0[row][column] = 1;
    
    for (let step = 0; step < k; step++) {
        for (let r = 0; r < n; r++) {
            for (let c = 0; c < n; c++) {
                if (dp0[r][c] !== 0) {
                    for (const [dr, dc] of directions) {
                        let newRow = r + dr;
                        let newCol = c + dc;
                        if (newRow >= 0 && newRow < n && newCol >= 0 && newCol < n) {
                            dp1[newRow][newCol] += dp0[r][c] / 8;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        // Swap dp0 and dp1
        [dp0, dp1] = [dp1, dp0];
        // Reset dp1 for the next iteration
        for (let r = 0; r < n; r++) {
            dp1[r].fill(0);
        }
    }
    
    let result = 0;
    for (let r = 0; r < n; r++) {
        for (let c = 0; c < n; c++) {
            result += dp0[r][c];
        }
    }
    
    return result;
};
```

This code dynamically computes the probability of staying on the board by simulating each of the knight's moves and updating the probability distributions accordingly. The result will be the cumulative probability of the knight being on any valid cell after `k` moves.
