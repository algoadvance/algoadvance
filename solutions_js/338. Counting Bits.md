[Leetcode 338. Counting Bits](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l338)
## Problem Statement
Given an integer `n`, return an array `ans` of length `n + 1` such that for each `i` (0 <= i <= n), `ans[i]` is the number of `1`s in the binary representation of `i`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the range of the input integer `n`?
     - **Answer:** The input integer `n` will be in the range `0 <= n <= 10^5`.
     
2. **Output:**
   - The output should be an array of integers where each element represents the count of `1`s in the binary representation of the corresponding index.

## Strategy
1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` will store the number of `1`s in the binary representation of the number `i`.
   - We know that the number of `1`s in the binary representation of `i` can be derived from `i >> 1` (i.e., `i` right-shifted by one bit) and the least significant bit of `i`.
   - Specifically, `dp[i] = dp[i >> 1] + (i & 1)`.
     - `i >> 1` right shifts `i` by one bit, essentially removing the least significant bit.
     - `(i & 1)` checks if the least significant bit is `1` (resulting in 1) or `0` (resulting in 0).
   - Initialize `dp[0]` to `0` as there are no `1`s in the binary representation of `0`.
   - Iterate from `1` to `n`, populate the `dp` array using the above relation, and return the `dp` array.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var countBits = function(n) {
    // Create an array to store the number of 1s for each number
    let dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    
    // Populate the dp array using the derived formula
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {
        dp[i] = dp[i >> 1] + (i & 1);
    }
    
    return dp;
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n)
  - The loop runs from `1` to `n`, performing O(1) operations for each iteration.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n)
  - We are using a list `dp` of size `n + 1` to store the results, which takes up O(n) space.
