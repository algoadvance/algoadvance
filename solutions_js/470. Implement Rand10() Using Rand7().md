## Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 470: **Implement rand10() Using rand7()**

Given a function `rand7()` that generates a uniform random integer in the range [1, 7], write a function `rand10()` that generates a uniform random integer in the range [1, 10]. You can only call the `rand7()` function, and cannot use any other library function.

**Function Signature:**
```javascript
function rand10() {
    // Implementation here
}
```


## Clarifying Questions

1. **rand7() guarantees uniform distribution?**
   - Yes, `rand7()` generates uniform random integers in the range [1, 7] with equal probability.

2. **Can I use any additional space or helper functions?**
   - Yes, but calls to `rand7()` must be the only source of randomness.

3. **Do I need to handle any specific edge cases?**
   - The primary goal is to ensure the uniform distribution in the range [1, 10]. Handling edge cases within that constraint is essential.

## Strategy

Given that `rand7()` produces numbers from 1 to 7 uniformly, we need a method to extend this to produce numbers from 1 to 10 uniformly.

### Steps:
1. **Generate a uniform distribution for a range larger than 7** using multiple calls to `rand7()`. A common approach is to generate `rand49()` because 49 is the largest perfect square smaller than 64 = 7 * 10.
2. **Scale the result from 1−49 to 1−10**. If a number falls out of the target range, reject it and retry.

Here’s a plan:
1. Generate numbers from 1 to 49 by converting 2 calls of `rand7()` into a single number.
2. If the generated number is within the range 1 to 40, map it straightforwardly to a number in the range 1-10. If not, discard and repeat.

### Formula to Combine rand7() Calls:
- `(rand7() - 1) * 7 + rand7()` gives values 1 to 49 uniformly distributed.

## Code

```javascript
function rand7() {
    // Assume this function is already defined and returns a random integer from 1 to 7
}

function rand10() {
    while (true) {
        const num1to49 = (rand7() - 1) * 7 + rand7(); // Uniformly distributed from 1 to 49
        if (num1to49 <= 40) {
            return ((num1to49 - 1) % 10) + 1; // Map to 1-10
        }
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Expected Time Complexity**: The expected number of calls to `rand7()` until a valid result is obtained is constant. Since the probability of getting a valid number in each iteration is 40/49, the expected number of iterations is `49/40 ≈ 1.225`. Thus, the expected number of calls to `rand7()` is constant, making the expected time complexity O(1).

This ensures that `rand10()` is both efficient and uniformly distributed over the range [1, 10].
