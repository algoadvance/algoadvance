[Leetcode 1382. Balance a Binary Search Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1382)
### Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary search tree, return a balanced binary search tree with the same node values. If there is more than one answer, return any of them. A binary search tree is balanced if the depth of the two subtrees of every node never differs by more than 1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What is the maximum number of nodes in the tree?
   **A:** The problem constraints typically fit within the bounds of common LeetCode problems, which could be up to \(10^4\) nodes.
   
2. **Q:** What should be returned as the result?
   **A:** Return the root of the balanced binary search tree.

3. **Q:** Can nodes have duplicate values?
   **A:** Given the nature of BSTs and this problem statement, we assume no duplicate values in the initial tree.

4. **Q:** Can the input binary search tree be empty?
   **A:** Yes, the input tree can be empty (`null` root), and in that case, we should return `null`.

### Strategy

To balance a binary search tree, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Inorder Traversal**: Perform an inorder traversal of the BST to get the nodes in ascending order.
2. **Build Balanced BST**: Use the sorted array from the inorder traversal to construct a balanced BST.

#### Algorithm

1. **Inorder Traversal**: Recursively traverse the tree in an inorder fashion and collect the nodes.
2. **Construct Balanced BST**: Use the sorted list from the inorder traversal to recursively build a balanced BST.

### Code

```javascript
class TreeNode {
    constructor(val, left = null, right = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var balanceBST = function(root) {
    if (!root) return null;
    
    // Step 1: Perform inorder traversal to get nodes in sorted order
    const nodes = [];
    
    const inorderTraversal = (node) => {
        if (!node) return;
        inorderTraversal(node.left);
        nodes.push(node.val);
        inorderTraversal(node.right);
    };
    
    inorderTraversal(root);
    
    // Step 2: Construct balanced BST from sorted nodes
    const buildBST = (start, end) => {
        if (start > end) return null;
        
        const mid = Math.floor((start + end) / 2);
        const root = new TreeNode(nodes[mid]);
        
        root.left = buildBST(start, mid - 1);
        root.right = buildBST(mid + 1, end);
        
        return root;
    };
    
    return buildBST(0, nodes.length - 1);
};
```

### Time Complexity

**Inorder Traversal**: \(O(N)\) where \(N\) is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because each node is visited exactly once.

**Constructing the Balanced BST**: The helper function to construct the balanced BST from the sorted array also runs in \(O(N)\) time since each element is used exactly once to create a node.

Overall, the combined time complexity is \(O(N)\).

### Space Complexity

**Inorder Traversal**: \(O(N)\) extra space is required for storing the nodes in a list.
**Constructing the Balanced BST**: The recursion stack depth is \(O(\log N)\) in the best case, but in the worst case, it can go up to \(O(N)\), considering the space complexity involved in recursion.

Overall, the space complexity is \(O(N)\).
