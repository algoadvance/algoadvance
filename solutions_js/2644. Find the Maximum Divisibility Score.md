[Leetcode 2644. Find the Maximum Divisibility Score](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2644)
### Problem Statement

You are given two 0-indexed integer arrays `nums` and `divisors`. The divisibility score of `divisors[i]` is the number of indices j such that `nums[j]` is divisible by `divisors[i]`. Return **the divisor with the maximum divisibility score**. If there is more than one such divisor, return the smallest one.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What if `nums` or `divisors` arrays are empty?**
   - Assumption: We can assume that these arrays are non-empty since the problem statement doesn't specify handling for empty arrays.
   
2. **What are the ranges and limits for the elements in `nums` and `divisors` arrays?**
   - Assumption: The elements in `nums` and `divisors` are within a reasonable integer range (e.g., within the limits of standard integer values in JavaScript).

3. **Can negative numbers be present in `nums` and `divisors`?**
   - Assumption: Yes, since the problem doesn't specify that numbers are only positive.

### Strategy

1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the maximum divisibility score and another variable to store the corresponding divisor.
2. Iterate through each divisor in `divisors`.
3. For each divisor, iterate through `nums` to count how many numbers are divisible by this divisor.
4. If the current divisor has a higher divisibility score than the previously stored maximum score, update the maximum score and set this divisor as the result.
5. If a tie occurs (i.e., two divisors have the same score), choose the smaller divisor.
6. Return the divisor with the highest divisibility score.

### Code

```javascript
function maxDivScore(nums, divisors) {
    let maxScore = -1;
    let bestDivisor = Infinity;
    
    for (let divisor of divisors) {
        let currentScore = 0;
        for (let num of nums) {
            if (num % divisor === 0) {
                currentScore++;
            }
        }
        if (currentScore > maxScore || (currentScore === maxScore && divisor < bestDivisor)) {
            maxScore = currentScore;
            bestDivisor = divisor;
        }
    }
    
    return bestDivisor;
}

// Example usage:
const nums = [8, 12, 15, 18];
const divisors = [2, 3, 4];
console.log(maxDivScore(nums, divisors));  // Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

- **Outer Loop**: Iterates over the `divisors` array, which has `m` elements. So, `O(m)`.
- **Inner Loop**: Iterates over the `nums` array, which has `n` elements. In the worst case, this takes `O(n)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the length of `divisors` and `n` is the length of `nums`. The space complexity is `O(1)` since we are using a constant amount of extra space.
