[Leetcode 2057. Smallest Index With Equal Value](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2057)
### Problem Statement

Given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums`, return the smallest index `i` of `nums` such that `i mod 10 == nums[i]`. Return `-1` if no such index exists.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of numbers in the array?**
   - The numbers will be non-negative integers.

2. **What is the range of the length of the array?**
   - The length of the array can vary but will be within practical limits for computation.

3. **Do I need to handle any specific edge cases?**
   - Consider arrays that are empty or have all elements not satisfying the condition.

### Strategy

1. Iterate through the array.
2. For each index `i`, check if `i % 10 == nums[i]`.
3. If you find such an index, return it.
4. If no such index is found by the end of the iteration, return `-1`.

### Code

```javascript
function smallestIndexWithEqualValue(nums) {
    // Iterating through the array
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; ++i) {
        // Check if i mod 10 is equal to nums[i]
        if (i % 10 === nums[i]) {
            return i; // Return the smallest index found
        }
    }
    return -1; // Return -1 if no such index exists
}
```

### Explanation:

- **Input:** `nums` (an array of integers)
- **Output:** The smallest index `i` such that `i % 10 == nums[i]`, or `-1` if no such index exists.
- **Step-by-Step Approach:**
  1. Iterate from the start (`i = 0`) to the end of the array.
  2. During each iteration, check if `i % 10 == nums[i]`.
  3. If true, return the index `i`.
  4. If the loop completes without finding such an index, return `-1`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \)
  - Where \( n \) is the length of the array since we check each element once.
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(1) \)
  - We are using a constant amount of extra space (no significant additional space beyond a few variables).

This simple linear scan ensures that we get the smallest index efficiently.
