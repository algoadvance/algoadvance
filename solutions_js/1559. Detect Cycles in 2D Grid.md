[Leetcode 1559. Detect Cycles in 2D Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1559)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D grid of `n` x `m` of characters. You need to detect cycles in the grid. A cycle is a path that starts and ends at the same cell and consists of at least 4 cells. The two consecutive cells in the path can only share a common edge. A cycle is not allowed to cross itself.

Write a function `containsCycle(grid: string[][]): boolean` to return `true` if the grid contains a cycle, or `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. What is the size range of the grid?
   - The grid can contain between `1x1` and `100x100` cells.
2. What characters does the grid contain?
   - The grid contains only lowercase alphabets (a-z).
3. Can we assume the input is always valid?
   - Yes, the input grid is always valid within the given constraints.
4. What should be the output for a 1x1 grid?
   - Since a cycle must consist of at least 4 cells, a 1x1 grid does not contain a cycle, so the function should return `false`.

### Strategy

To detect cycles in a 2D grid, we can use Depth First Search (DFS) with a few modifications. We will:

1. Traverse the grid and start a DFS whenever we encounter a new, unvisited cell.
2. During the DFS traversal, keep track of the previous cell to avoid trivial backtracking.
3. If we encounter a visited cell during the DFS traversal that is not the previous cell, this indicates the presence of a cycle.

### Code

```javascript
function containsCycle(grid) {
    const rows = grid.length;
    const cols = grid[0].length;

    // Matrix to keep track of visited cells
    const visited = Array.from({ length: rows }, () => Array(cols).fill(false));

    // Directions for moving in the grid (up, right, down, left)
    const directions = [
        [-1, 0],
        [0, 1],
        [1, 0],
        [0, -1]
    ];

    // Helper function for DFS
    function dfs(x, y, parentX, parentY, character) {
        visited[x][y] = true;

        for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
            const nx = x + dx, ny = y + dy;

            // Check boundaries
            if (nx >= 0 && ny >= 0 && nx < rows && ny < cols) {
                // If the next cell has the same character
                if (grid[nx][ny] === character) {
                    // If the next cell is visited and it's not the parent, cycle detected
                    if (visited[nx][ny] && (nx !== parentX || ny !== parentY)) {
                        return true;
                    }

                    // If the next cell is not visited, continue DFS
                    if (!visited[nx][ny]) {
                        if (dfs(nx, ny, x, y, character)) {
                            return true;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        return false;
    }

    // Iterate over all cells in the grid
    for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            // Start a DFS if the cell has not been visited before
            if (!visited[i][j]) {
                if (dfs(i, j, -1, -1, grid[i][j])) {
                    return true;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return false;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(N * M), where N is the number of rows and M is the number of columns. Each cell is processed at most once due to the visited matrix.
- **Space Complexity:** O(N * M) for the visited matrix and the call stack for DFS recursion.

This approach should efficiently determine if there is a cycle in the 2D grid, given the constraints.
