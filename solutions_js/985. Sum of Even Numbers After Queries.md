[Leetcode 985. Sum of Even Numbers After Queries](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l985)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` and an array `queries` where `queries[i] = [val, index]`. For each query `i`, add `val` to `nums[index]`. Then, calculate the sum of the even values of `nums` and store this result.

Return an array `answer` where `answer[i]` is the answer to the `i-th` query.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - `1 <= nums.length <= 10^4`
   - `-10^4 <= nums[i] <= 10^4`
   - `1 <= queries.length <= 10^4`
   - `-10^4 <= val <= 10^4`
   - `0 <= index < nums.length`
   
2. **Output:**
   - An array of integers representing the sum of even numbers after each query is applied.

3. **Example:**
   ```javascript
   Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], queries = [[1,0],[-3,1],[-4,0],[2,3]]
   Output: [8,6,2,4]
   ```

### Strategy
1. **Initial Even Sum:**
   - Calculate the initial sum of all even numbers in `nums`.
   
2. **Processing Each Query:**
   - For each query, update the element at the specified index.
   - Before updating, if the element at the index is even, subtract it from the sum of even numbers.
   - Update the element.
   - If the new value is even, add it to the sum of even numbers.
   - Store the current sum of even numbers in the result array.

### Time Complexity
- The initial sum calculation is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of `nums`.
- Processing each query is `O(1)`, and there are `q` queries.
- Overall, the complexity is `O(n + q)`.

### Solution Code

```javascript
var sumEvenAfterQueries = function(nums, queries) {
    let evenSum = 0;
    
    // Initial calculation of the sum of even numbers
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (num % 2 === 0) {
            evenSum += num;
        }
    }
    
    const result = [];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < queries.length; i++) {
        const [val, index] = queries[i];
        const originalValue = nums[index];
        
        if (originalValue % 2 === 0) {
            evenSum -= originalValue;
        }
        
        nums[index] += val;
        
        const newValue = nums[index];
        
        if (newValue % 2 === 0) {
            evenSum += newValue;
        }
        
        result.push(evenSum);
    }
    
    return result;
};

// Example usage
let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4];
let queries = [[1, 0], [-3, 1], [-4, 0], [2, 3]];
console.log(sumEvenAfterQueries(nums, queries)); // [8, 6, 2, 4]
```

### Explanation
1. **Initial Setup:**
   - Calculate the initial sum of even numbers.

2. **Processing Queries:**
   - For each query, adjust the even sum based on whether the affected element was even before and after the update.
   - Store the updated even sum in the result after each query.

By following this strategy, we ensure that the solution efficiently handles even large input sizes within the provided constraints.
