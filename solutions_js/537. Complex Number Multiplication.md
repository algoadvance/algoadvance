[Leetcode 537. Complex Number Multiplication](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l537)
### Problem Statement

Given two strings representing two complex numbers, you need to multiply these complex numbers and return the product in the same string representation.

A complex number is a number that can be expressed in the form `a + bi`, where `a` and `b` are real numbers, and `i` is the unit imaginary number. The given strings will represent complex numbers in this standard form: `"a+bi"` where `a` and `b` are integers.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input:**
    - Will the input strings always be valid complex number representations?
    - Will the integers in the complex number always be positive or can they be negative?

2. **Output:**
    - Should the output string strictly follow the same format `"a+bi"`, even if `b` is negative (e.g., `a+-bi`)?

3. **Special Cases:**
    - How should we handle cases where either `a` or `b` is zero?

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} num1
 * @param {string} num2
 * @return {string}
 */
var complexNumberMultiply = function(num1, num2) {
    // Helper function to parse the complex number string into real and imaginary parts
    function parseComplexNumber(str) {
        let [real, imaginary] = str.split('+');
        imaginary = imaginary.replace('i', '');
        return [parseInt(real), parseInt(imaginary)];
    }

    // Parse the complex numbers
    let [a1, b1] = parseComplexNumber(num1);
    let [a2, b2] = parseComplexNumber(num2);

    // Perform the multiplication
    let realPart = a1 * a2 - b1 * b2;
    let imaginaryPart = a1 * b2 + a2 * b1;

    // Return the result in the required format
    return `${realPart}+${imaginaryPart}i`;
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Parsing the Complex Numbers:**
    - The strings are in the format `"a+bi"`.
    - We need to extract `a` and `b` from each string. This can be achieved by splitting the string at `'+'`, and then removing the '`i`' from the second part.

2. **Complex Number Multiplication:**
    - Given two complex numbers `a1 + b1i` and `a2 + b2i`, their product is computed as:
      \[
      (a1 + b1i) \cdot (a2 + b2i) = a1a2 + a1b2i + b1a2i + (b1b2)i^2
      \]
      Since \(i^2 = -1\), we get:
      \[
      (a1a2 - b1b2) + (a1b2 + b1a2)i
      \]
    - Therefore the real part of the product is `(a1 * a2 - b1 * b2)` and the imaginary part is `(a1 * b2 + a2 * b1)`.

3. **Form the Result String:**
    - Construct the result string in the format `"realPart+imaginaryParti"` using template strings.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**
    - Parsing the two input strings is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the strings.
    - The arithmetic operations are \(O(1)\).
    - Forming the output string is \(O(1)\).
    - Therefore, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\).

- **Space Complexity:**
    - We use a constant amount of extra space for storing parsed integers and the final result string.
    - Therefore, the space complexity is \(O(1)\).

Is there anything else you'd like to clarify or need further assistance with?
