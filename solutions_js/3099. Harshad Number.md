[Leetcode 3099. Harshad Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3099)
## Problem Statement

A Harshad Number (or Niven number) is an integer that is divisible by the sum of its digits. Write a function in JavaScript to determine if a given number is a Harshad Number.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**: What is the range of numbers we should handle (e.g., only positive integers)?
2. **Output**: Should the function return a boolean value indicating whether the number is a Harshad Number or not?
3. **Edge Cases**: How should the function handle edge cases like `0`? 

Assuming this is a general problem and we're focusing on positive integers, we'll ignore non-positive integers and return `false` in such cases.

## Strategy

1. **Sum up the Digits**: Convert the given number to a string or directly manipulate it to sum its digits.
2. **Check Divisibility**: Determine if the original number is divisible by the sum of its digits.

## Code

```javascript
function isHarshadNumber(num) {
    // Handle non-positive integers
    if (num <= 0) return false;
    
    // Convert the number to a string, split it into digits, and compute the sum of the digits
    const sumOfDigits = num.toString().split('').reduce((sum, digit) => sum + parseInt(digit), 0);
    
    // Check if the number is divisible by the sum of its digits
    return num % sumOfDigits === 0;
}

// Test Cases
console.log(isHarshadNumber(18)); // true (1 + 8 = 9, and 18 % 9 == 0)
console.log(isHarshadNumber(19)); // false (1 + 9 = 10, and 19 % 10 != 0)
console.log(isHarshadNumber(21)); // true (2 + 1 = 3, and 21 % 3 == 0)
console.log(isHarshadNumber(0));  // false (0 is not considered)
console.log(isHarshadNumber(-5)); // false (negative numbers are not considered)
```

## Time Complexity

- **Computing Sum of Digits**: O(d) where `d` is the number of digits in the number.
- **Divisibility Check**: O(1).

**Overall Time Complexity**: O(d), where `d` is the number of digits in the input number.

This is efficient for typical use cases as the number of digits `d` will be quite small even for large integers.
