[Leetcode 1833. Maximum Ice Cream Bars](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1833)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `costs` where `costs[i]` is the price of the `i-th` ice cream bar. 
You have `coins` coins to spend, and you want to buy as many ice cream bars as possible. 

Return the **maximum number** of ice cream bars you can buy with `coins` coins.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: costs = [1,3,2,4,1], coins = 7
Output: 4
Explanation: The 4 ice creams can be purchased at [1, 3, 2, 1], that is 1 + 3 + 2 + 1 = 7.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: costs = [10,6,8,7,7,8], coins = 5
Output: 0
Explanation: You cannot buy any of the ice creams because you do not have enough coins.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: costs = [1,6,3,1,2,5], coins = 20
Output: 6
Explanation: You can buy all the ice creams.```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are all the values in costs positive integers?
2. Can we assume that the input array and the coins value will always be valid and within a reasonable size?

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Costs**: Since we want to maximize the number of ice creams we can buy, we should start by buying the cheaper ones. Sorting the `costs` array will help us do this.
2. **Iterate and Count**: Iterate through the sorted `costs` array and keep a running total of the coins spent. Each time we add the cost of an ice cream bar, we check if we still have coins left. If we do, we increment our count of ice creams. If not, we stop.
3. **Result**: The count at the end of the iteration will be the maximum number of ice creams we can buy.

### Code

```javascript
function maxIceCream(costs, coins) {
    // Step 1: Sort the costs array
    costs.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    let count = 0;
    
    // Step 2: Iterate through the sorted costs
    for (let cost of costs) {
        if (coins >= cost) {
            coins -= cost;
            count++;
        } else {
            // If we can't buy this ice cream, exit the loop
            break;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

// Example usage
console.log(maxIceCream([1,3,2,4,1], 7)); // Output: 4
console.log(maxIceCream([10,6,8,7,7,8], 5)); // Output: 0
console.log(maxIceCream([1,6,3,1,2,5], 20)); // Output: 6
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting**: The main time-consuming operation is sorting the `costs` array, which takes \(O(n \log n)\), where `n` is the length of the array.
2. **Iteration**: After sorting, we only iterate through the array once, which is \(O(n)\).

Therefore, the overall time complexity of the solution is \(O(n \log n)\).
