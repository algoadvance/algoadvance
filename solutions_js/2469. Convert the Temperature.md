[Leetcode 2469. Convert the Temperature](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2469)
### Problem Statement

You are given a floating-point number that represents a temperature in Celsius. Your task is to convert it to Kelvin and Fahrenheit and return it in an array, where the first element is the temperature in Kelvin and the second element is the temperature in Fahrenheit.

The relationships between Celsius (C), Kelvin (K), and Fahrenheit (F) are:
- \(K = C + 273.15\)
- \(F = C \times \frac{9}{5} + 32\)

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - Are there any constraints on the range of the input temperature in Celsius?
     - Typically, Celsius temperatures can range from very low (like \( -273.15 \) degrees, which is absolute zero) to extremely high values.
  
2. **Output Precision**:
   - Should the output temperatures be returned to a specific number of decimal places or can they be left as floating-point numbers?
     - If not specified, we can assume standard floating-point precision is acceptable.

3. **Input Types**:
   - Can we assume the input will always be a valid floating-point number?
     - Yes, for simplicity, we'll assume valid input.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} celsius
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var convertTemperature = function(celsius) {
    let kelvin = celsius + 273.15;
    let fahrenheit = celsius * 9 / 5 + 32;
    return [kelvin, fahrenheit];
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Understanding the Formulas**:
   - To convert Celsius to Kelvin, add 273.15 to the Celsius value.
   - To convert Celsius to Fahrenheit, use the formula \(F = C \times \frac{9}{5} + 32\).

2. **Implementation**:
   - Receive the Celsius input as a floating-point number.
   - Apply the conversion formulas to compute Kelvin and Fahrenheit.
   - Return the results as an array with the first element being Kelvin and the second being Fahrenheit.

3. **Example**:
   - If the input Celsius temperature is 25:
     - Kelvin: \(25 + 273.15 = 298.15\)
     - Fahrenheit: \(25 \times \frac{9}{5} + 32 = 77\)
   - The output array will be [298.15, 77].

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(1)\), meaning it is constant time. This is because the operations involved (addition and multiplication) are basic arithmetic operations that take a constant amount of time, regardless of the input size.
