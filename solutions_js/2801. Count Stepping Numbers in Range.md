[Leetcode 2801. Count Stepping Numbers in Range](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2801)
## Problem Statement

Problem 2801: Count Stepping Numbers in Range-out

You are given two integers `low` and `high`, representing a range. A stepping number is an integer such that all of its adjacent digits have an absolute difference of `1`.

For example, 123 is a stepping number because the absolute difference between adjacent digits (1 and 2, and 2 and 3) is 1, while 358 is not because the absolute difference between 5 and 8 is 3.

Your task is to return the count of all the stepping numbers in the range `[low, high]` inclusive.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the integers `low` and `high` always positive?**
   - This problem typically assumes positive integers, but clarifying with the interviewer would be useful.
   
2. **Can `low` be greater than `high`?**
   - It's safe to assume `low <= high` for a valid range, otherwise the result would be 0.

3. **Is there a specific maximum bound for `low` and `high`?**
   - In competitive programming, constraints are often provided. Here we assume a reasonable range for typical computational limits (e.g., `0 <= low, high <= 10^9`).

## Strategy

### Approach

The problem involves generating "stepping numbers" within a range. We will use a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to generate all stepping numbers up to the high value, starting from each digit 1 through 9. This is efficient because it constructs numbers in a level-based manner, where each level corresponds to the position of a digit in the stepping number.

### Steps

1. Start a BFS for each digit from 1 to 9 (since a number cannot start with 0).
2. Extend each number by appending digits that maintain the stepping property.
3. Check if the formed number falls within the range `[low, high]` and count it if it does.

### Detailed BFS Strategy

- Initialize a queue with numbers from 1 to 9.
- For each number, try to add the next digit such that the absolute difference with the last digit is 1.
- Use modulo and integer division to derive the new possible numbers.
- Continue this process until numbers exceed the upper bound of the range.

### Edge Cases

1. **Range includes 0:** Directly add 0 if `0` is within the range.
2. **Small ranges:** The method must efficiently handle small ranges without excessive computation.

## Code

```javascript
var countSteppingNumbers = function(low, high) {
    // BFS queue and initial count of stepping numbers
    let count = 0;
    let queue = [];
    
    // Add initial numbers 1 to 9 to the queue
    for (let i = 1; i <= 9; i++) {
        queue.push(i);
    }
    
    // Special case: if 0 is within the range, include it.
    if (low === 0) count++;
    
    // BFS to find all stepping numbers within the range
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        let num = queue.shift();
        
        // If num is within the range, count it
        if (num >= low && num <= high) {
            count++;
        }

        // If num is larger than high, no need to continue processing it
        if (num < high) {
            // Get the last digit of the current number
            let lastDigit = num % 10;

            // Generate next potential stepping numbers
            let numA = num * 10 + (lastDigit - 1);
            let numB = num * 10 + (lastDigit + 1);

            // Check lastDigit is not 0 to avoid placing -1 as a digit
            if (lastDigit > 0 && numA <= high) {
                queue.push(numA);
            }

            // Check lastDigit is not 9 to avoid placing 10 as a digit
            if (lastDigit < 9 && numB <= high) {
                queue.push(numB);
            }
        }
    }

    return count;
};

// Example Usage
console.log(countSteppingNumbers(0, 21)); // Expected Output: 13
```

## Time Complexity

The BFS ensures we explore every valid stepping number only once:

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the count of stepping numbers within the specified range.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(n)\), to maintain the BFS queue and other temporary storage.

By efficiently constructing stepping numbers and pruning branches that exceed the upper limit, this approach keeps operations manageable even for larger ranges.
