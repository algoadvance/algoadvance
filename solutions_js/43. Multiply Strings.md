[Leetcode 43. Multiply Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l43)
### Problem Statement

Given two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` represented as strings, return the product of `num1` and `num2`, also represented as a string.

**Note:**
- You must not use any built-in BigInteger library or convert the inputs to integer directly.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the strings be empty?**
   - No, the problem statement guarantees that `num1` and `num2` are non-empty strings.
  
2. **Should I handle leading zeros in the output?**
   - Leading zeros in the output should not be present except if the product is zero itself.

3. **What is the maximum length of the input strings?**
   - The problem statement does not specify a maximum length, but you can assume the lengths are reasonably large to fit typical constraints of competitive programming environments.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize the Result Array**: Create an array `result` to store the intermediate sums, with a size of `num1.length + num2.length` because the maximum length of the product will be at most `m + n` where `m` and `n` are lengths of `num1` and `num2`.

2. **Positioning Multiplication Results**: For each digit in `num1` (starting from the end), multiply it with each digit in `num2` (starting from the end). Accumulate the result in the corresponding position in the `result` array.

3. **Carry Handling**: After each multiplication, take care of carry by adding the integer division to the next position.

4. **Conversion to String**: After performing all multiplications, convert the non-zero leading results into a string. Ignore leading zeros except when the result is zero.

5. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where either `num1` or `num2` is "0".

### Code

```javascript
function multiply(num1, num2) {
    let m = num1.length, n = num2.length;
    let result = new Array(m + n).fill(0);

    for (let i = m - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        for (let j = n - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            let mul = (num1[i].charCodeAt(0) - '0'.charCodeAt(0)) *
                      (num2[j].charCodeAt(0) - '0'.charCodeAt(0));
            let sum = mul + result[i + j + 1];

            result[i + j + 1] = sum % 10;
            result[i + j] += Math.floor(sum / 10);
        }
    }

    // Convert result to string
    let resultStr = result.join('');
    while (resultStr[0] === '0' && resultStr.length > 1) {
        resultStr = resultStr.slice(1);
    }

    return resultStr;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(m * n)
  - Here, `m` is the length of `num1` and `n` is the length of `num2`.
  - Each digit in `num1` is multiplied with each digit in `num2` resulting in m * n operations.

- **Space Complexity**: O(m + n)
  - The space complexity is primarily due to the result array that stores intermediate sums.

This approach ensures that we handle the problem directly without using built-in libraries or converting strings directly to integers, thus satisfying the constraints comprehensively.
