[Leetcode 849. Maximize Distance to Closest Person](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l849)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array representing a row of seats where `seats[i] = 1` represents a person sitting in the `i-th` seat and `seats[i] = 0` represents that the `i-th` seat is empty (0-indexed). There is at least one empty seat and at least one person sitting.

Alex wants to sit in the seat such that the distance to the closest person is maximized. Return that maximum distance to the closest person.

### Example

```
Input: seats = [1,0,0,0,1,0,1]
Output: 2
Explanation: 
If Alex sits in the second open seat (i.e., seats[2]), then the closest person is 2 seats away.
If Alex sits in any other open seat, the closest person is 1 seat away.
Thus, the maximum distance to the closest person is 2.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can there be multiple solutions with the same maximum distance?
   **A:** Yes, Alex only cares about the maximum distance to the closest person.
   
2. **Q:** Is there any limitation on the length of `seats`?
   **A:** No, but for practical purposes, let's assume it fits within normal constraints (e.g., `1 <= seats.length <= 10^4`).

3. **Q:** How should the solution handle the edges of the seats array?
   **A:** It's important to consider open seats at the beginning and the end of the array, as they can influence the maximum distance calculation.

### Strategy

1. Traverse the array to identify the distances between consecutive people.
2. Capture three scenarios:
   - The distance before the first person (leading zeros).
   - The distances between people (middle zeros).
   - The distance after the last person (trailing zeros).
3. Calculate the possible maximum distances and return the largest one.

### Code

```javascript
var maxDistToClosest = function(seats) {
    let maxDist = 0;
    let lastPerson = -1;
    let n = seats.length;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (seats[i] === 1) {
            if (lastPerson === -1) {
                // Case: Distance from start to the first person
                maxDist = i;
            } else {
                // Case: Distance between two people, take half the distance
                maxDist = Math.max(maxDist, Math.floor((i - lastPerson) / 2));
            }
            lastPerson = i;
        }
    }

    // Case: Distance from the last person to the end
    if (seats[n - 1] === 0) {
        maxDist = Math.max(maxDist, n - lastPerson - 1);
    }

    return maxDist;
};

// Example Usage
let seats = [1,0,0,0,1,0,1];
console.log(maxDistToClosest(seats));  // Output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where `n` is the length of the seats array. We only need to traverse the array once to capture the necessary distances. 

By considering the edge cases and calculating distances appropriately, we ensure that the solution is both efficient and comprehensive.
