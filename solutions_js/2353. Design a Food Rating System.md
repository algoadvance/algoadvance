## Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 2353: Design a Food Rating System

You need to implement a `FoodRatings` class:

- `FoodRatings(String[] foods, String[] cuisines, int[] ratings)`: Initializes the system. The `foods`, `cuisines`, and `ratings` arrays will all have the same length, and each food will appear in the array only once.
- `void changeRating(String food, int newRating)`: Changes the rating of the specified `food` to `newRating`.
- `String highestRated(String cuisine)`: Returns the food item for the specified cuisine with the highest rating. If there is a tie, return the lexicographically smallest food item.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on the inputs?**
   - The lengths of `foods`, `cuisines`, and `ratings` will be in the range `[1, 2 * 10^4]`.
   - Ratings are between 1 and 10^5.

2. **Is there any constraints around the rating changing query?**
   - Any `food` passed to `changeRating` is guaranteed to be in the initialized system.

3. **How should ties be handled for highest-rated foods?**
   - Ties should be broken by returning the lexicographically smallest food item.

## Strategy

The main goal is to efficiently manage the cuisine-wise highest ratings and handle rating updates. 

Here is the approach:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Use a dictionary `food_to_cuisine` to map each food to its cuisine.
   - Use a dictionary `food_to_rating` to store the current rating of each food.
   - Use a dictionary `cuisine_to_foods` to store a max-heap for each cuisine, where each heap contains tuples of (negative rating, food name). Using a max-heap helps in efficiently retrieving and updating the highest-rated food.

2. **Change Rating**:
   - Update the rating in `food_to_rating`.
   - Update the max-heap for the corresponding cuisine.

3. **Find Highest Rated**:
   - For a given cuisine, the highest-rated food is at the top of its max-heap. Ensure the heap is correctly maintained by removing outdated entries.

## Code

```javascript
class FoodRatings {
    constructor(foods, cuisines, ratings) {
        this.food_to_cuisine = new Map();
        this.food_to_rating = new Map();
        this.cuisine_to_foods = new Map();

        for (let i = 0; i < foods.length; i++) {
            let food = foods[i];
            let cuisine = cuisines[i];
            let rating = ratings[i];

            this.food_to_cuisine.set(food, cuisine);
            this.food_to_rating.set(food, rating);

            if (!this.cuisine_to_foods.has(cuisine)) {
                this.cuisine_to_foods.set(cuisine, new MaxHeap());
            }
            this.cuisine_to_foods.get(cuisine).insert([-rating, food]);
        }
    }

    changeRating(food, newRating) {
        let cuisine = this.food_to_cuisine.get(food);
        let oldRating = this.food_to_rating.get(food);

        // Update food rating
        this.food_to_rating.set(food, newRating);

        // Insert the updated rating to the heap
        this.cuisine_to_foods.get(cuisine).insert([-newRating, food]);
    }

    highestRated(cuisine) {
        let heap = this.cuisine_to_foods.get(cuisine);
        while (true) {
            let [negRating, food] = heap.peek();
            // Ensure the returned food has the current rating
            if (-negRating === this.food_to_rating.get(food)) {
                return food;
            } else {
                heap.remove();
            }
        }
    }
}

class MaxHeap {
    constructor() {
        this.heap = [];
    }

    insert(element) {
        this.heap.push(element);
        this.heapifyUp();
    }

    remove() {
        if (this.heap.length > 1) {
            this.swap(0, this.heap.length - 1);
            const item = this.heap.pop();
            this.heapifyDown();
            return item;
        } else {
            return this.heap.pop();
        }
    }

    peek() {
        return this.heap[0];
    }

    heapifyUp() {
        let index = this.heap.length - 1;
        while (index > 0) {
            let parentIndex = Math.floor((index - 1) / 2);
            if (this.heap[index][0] < this.heap[parentIndex][0]) {
                this.swap(index, parentIndex);
                index = parentIndex;
            } else {
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    heapifyDown() {
        let index = 0;
        const length = this.heap.length;
        const element = this.heap[0];
        while (true) {
            let leftChildIndex = 2 * index + 1;
            let rightChildIndex = 2 * index + 2;
            let swapIndex = null;

            if (leftChildIndex < length) {
                if (this.heap[leftChildIndex][0] < element[0]) {
                    swapIndex = leftChildIndex;
                }
            }

            if (rightChildIndex < length) {
                if ((swapIndex === null && this.heap[rightChildIndex][0] < element[0]) || 
                    (swapIndex !== null && this.heap[rightChildIndex][0] < this.heap[swapIndex][0])) {
                    swapIndex = rightChildIndex;
                }
            }

            if (swapIndex === null) break;

            this.swap(index, swapIndex);
            index = swapIndex;
        }
    }

    swap(index1, index2) {
        [this.heap[index1], this.heap[index2]] = [this.heap[index2], this.heap[index1]];
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Initialization**: `O(N log N)` where `N` is the number of foods, because each food is inserted into the heap.
2. **Change Rating**: `O(log N)` for inserting and maintaining the max-heap.
3. **Highest Rated**: In the worst case `O(log N)` because it repeatedly peeks and removes elements from the heap.

This approach ensures efficient handling of operations to manage and query the food rating system.
