[Leetcode 2580. Count Ways to Group Overlapping Ranges](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2580)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of `ranges` where `ranges[i] = [start_i, end_i]` represents the start and end of the `i`-th range. You need to count the number of ways to group these ranges such that naive overlapping ranges are grouped together. Two ranges `[start_a, end_a]` and `[start_b, end_b]` overlap if there is some integer `x` such that `start_a <= x <= end_a` and `start_b <= x <= end_b`.

You need to count the number of distinct groups of overlapping ranges.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum size of the input list?**
   - This helps understand if a solution needs to be highly efficient or if brute-force solutions might suffice.

2. **Are the input ranges sorted in any way beforehand?**
   - This could influence how we approach the problem.

3. **Are there constraints on the values within the ranges (e.g., are they all positive, or can they be negative)?**
   - This helps to tailor our solution to handle specific cases if required.

### Strategy

To solve this, we will employ the following strategy:

1. **Sort the Ranges:**
   - First, sort the ranges based on their starting points to make it easier to find overlapping regions.

2. **Merge Overlapping Ranges:**
   - Iterate through the sorted ranges and merge them if they overlap. Use a list to track the merged intervals.

3. **Count the Groups:**
   - The number of merged intervals gives the number of groups of overlapping ranges.

### Code

Here's a possible implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} ranges
 * @return {number}
 */
function countGroups(ranges) {
    if (ranges.length === 0) return 0;
    
    // Sort ranges based on their starting point
    ranges.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);
    
    let merged = [];
    let current = ranges[0];
    
    for (let i = 1; i < ranges.length; i++) {
        // If current range overlaps with the next one
        if (ranges[i][0] <= current[1]) {
            // Extend the current range to include the next one
            current[1] = Math.max(current[1], ranges[i][1]);
        } else {
            // Otherwise, push the current range to merged and move to the next
            merged.push(current);
            current = ranges[i];
        }
    }
    
    // Push the final range
    merged.push(current);
    
    // Number of groups is the length of merged intervals
    return merged.length;
}

// Example Usage:
let ranges = [
  [1, 3],
  [2, 6],
  [8, 10],
  [15, 18]
];
console.log(countGroups(ranges)); // Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting: `O(n log n)`**, where `n` is the number of ranges.
- **Merging: `O(n)`**; we iterate through the list of ranges once to merge them.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **`O(n log n)`** due to the sorting step, which is the most time-consuming part of the algorithm.

This solution ensures that we efficiently count the number of groups by leveraging sorting and a single traversal for merging.
