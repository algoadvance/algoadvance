[Leetcode 2101. Detonate the Maximum Bombs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2101)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of bombs where each bomb is represented as `[x, y, r]` in a 2D plane, where `(x, y)` is the coordinate of the bomb and `r` is its blast radius.

A bomb `i` can detonate another bomb `j` if the bomb `j` is within the range of the bomb `i`. In other words, bomb `i` can detonate bomb `j` if the distance between bomb `i` and `j` is less than or equal to `r[i]`.

Given the list of bombs, return the maximum number of bombs that can be detonated if you are allowed to detonate only one initial bomb.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format**: Is it guaranteed that the input is well-formed without any missing values?
    - Yes, the input is guaranteed to be well-formed.

2. **Constraints**: What are the constraints on the values of `(x, y, r)` and the length of the bombs list?
    - `1 <= bombs.length <= 100`
    - `1 <= x_i, y_i, r_i <= 1000`

3. **Distance Calculation**: Should we consider Euclidean distance for checking if one bomb can detonate another?
    - Yes, the Euclidean distance should be used.

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation**: 
   - Represent the bombs as nodes in a graph.
   - There is a directed edge from bomb `i` to bomb `j` if bomb `j` can be detonated by bomb `i`.

2. **DFS/BFS for Maximum Detonation**:
   - For each bomb, use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to determine how many bombs can be detonated starting from that bomb.
   - Track the maximum number of bombs detonated from any starting bomb.

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - Calculate the Euclidean distance squared (to avoid floating-point precision issues) and compare it with the blast radius squared.

### Code

```javascript
const maxDetonatedBombs = function(bombs) {
    const n = bombs.length;
    
    const calculateDistanceSquare = (bomb1, bomb2) => {
        return (bomb1[0] - bomb2[0]) ** 2 + (bomb1[1] - bomb2[1]) ** 2;
    };
    
    const buildGraph = () => {
        const graph = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            const [x1, y1, r1] = bombs[i];
            for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
                if (i !== j) {
                    const [x2, y2, _] = bombs[j];
                    const distanceSquare = calculateDistanceSquare(bombs[i], bombs[j]);
                    if (distanceSquare <= r1 ** 2) {
                        graph[i].push(j);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        return graph;
    };
    
    const dfs = (graph, visited, node) => {
        let count = 1;
        visited[node] = true;
        for (const neighbor of graph[node]) {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                count += dfs(graph, visited, neighbor);
            }
        }
        return count;
    };
    
    const graph = buildGraph();
    let maxBombs = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        const visited = Array(n).fill(false);
        const detonatedBombs = dfs(graph, visited, i);
        maxBombs = Math.max(maxBombs, detonatedBombs);
    }
    
    return maxBombs;
};

// Example usage
console.log(maxDetonatedBombs([[2,1,3],[6,1,4]])); // Output: 2
console.log(maxDetonatedBombs([[1,1,5],[10,10,5]])); // Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity
- Building the adjacency list (graph) takes `O(n^2)` time as we need to check every pair of bombs.
- Running DFS from each bomb takes `O(n + edges)`, where edges can be up to `O(n^2)`. In the worst case, this results in `O(n^3)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n^3)` in the worst case. Given the constraints (with `n` up to 100), this complexity is manageable.
