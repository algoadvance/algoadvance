[Leetcode 2242. Maximum Score of a Node Sequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2242)
## Problem Statement

You are given a graph with `n` nodes labeled from `0` to `n - 1`, represented by a 2D integer array `edges`, where `edges[i] = [u, v, weight]` indicates that there is an undirected edge between nodes `u` and `v` with weight `weight`.

A node sequence is valid if it meets the following conditions:
1. There is an edge connecting every pair of consecutive nodes in the sequence.
2. No node is repeated in the sequence.

The score of a node sequence is defined as the sum of the weights of the edges in the sequence.

Return the **maximum** score of a valid node sequence with exactly four nodes. If no such sequence exists, return `-1`.

Constraints:
- `n == 4`
- The graph is complete.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **How many nodes and edges are in the graph?**
    - The problem states `n == 4`, indicating the graph has exactly four nodes.
2. **What are the constraints on the edge weights?**
    - Edge weights are given but not explicitly constrained in the problem statement.
3. **Is the graph guaranteed to be connected?**
    - Yes, given `n == 4` and it's a complete graph, every node is directly connected to every other node.

## Strategy

Since the graph is complete with only four nodes, we can use a brute-force approach to check all possible valid sequences of four nodes due to the small problem size:

1. **Generate All Permutations**: We generate all possible permutations of the 4 nodes.
2. **Check Validity and Calculate Scores**: For each permutation, check if there is an edge between every pair of consecutive nodes and calculate the score.
3. **Find the Maximum Score**: Keep track of the maximum score found.

## Code

```javascript
function maxScoreOfNodeSequence(edges) {
    // Create a map to store the weights with u and v as keys
    let edgeMap = new Map();
    edges.forEach(([u, v, weight]) => {
        edgeMap.set(u + '-' + v, weight);
        edgeMap.set(v + '-' + u, weight);
    });

    // Function to calculate the score of a permutation
    function calculateScore(permutation) {
        let score = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < permutation.length - 1; i++) {
            const edgeKey = permutation[i] + '-' + permutation[i + 1];
            if (!edgeMap.has(edgeKey)) return -1; // Invalid path
            score += edgeMap.get(edgeKey);
        }
        return score;
    }

    let maxScore = -1;
    const nodes = [0, 1, 2, 3];

    // Generate all permutations of the node array
    function permute(arr, l, r) {
        if (l === r) {
            const score = calculateScore(arr);
            if (score != -1) {
                maxScore = Math.max(maxScore, score);
            }
        } else {
            for (let i = l; i <= r; i++) {
                [arr[l], arr[i]] = [arr[i], arr[l]];  
                permute(arr, l + 1, r);
                [arr[l], arr[i]] = [arr[i], arr[l]]; 
            }
        }
    }

    permute(nodes, 0, nodes.length - 1);
    return maxScore;
}
```

## Time Complexity

Since we are generating all permutations of 4 nodes:
- There are `4!` (24) permutations.
- For each permutation, we calculate the score by looking up the edge weights in constant time.

Thus, the time complexity is O(1) since 24 is a constant and the graph is always of fixed size 4. This approach is feasible given the constraints.
