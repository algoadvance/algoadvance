[Leetcode 485. Max Consecutive Ones](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l485)
## Problem Statement

You are given a binary array `nums` (an array consisting only of 0s and 1s). You need to find the maximum number of consecutive 1s in the array.

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums = [1,1,0,1,1,1]
Output: 3
Explanation: The first two digits or the last three digits are consecutive 1s. The maximum number of consecutive 1s is 3.
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums = [1,0,1,1,0,1]
Output: 2
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= nums.length <= 10^5`
- `nums[i]` is either `0` or `1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on memory usage?**  
   Not explicitly mentioned, but we can assume we should use O(1) extra space.

2. **Do we need to consider edge cases like an empty array?**  
   The problem constraint guarantees at least one element, so no need to handle an empty array.

3. **Can the input contain a very large array?**  
   Yes, the array can be as large as 100,000 elements.

With these clarifications, let's move on to the strategy and coding.

## Strategy

1. **Initialize Counters:**
   - `maxCount` to store the maximum number of consecutive 1s found.
   - `currentCount` to count the current streak of 1s.

2. **Iterate Through the Array:**
   - If the element is `1`, increment `currentCount`.
   - If the element is `0`, compare `currentCount` with `maxCount` and update `maxCount` if needed. Then reset `currentCount` to 0.

3. **Final Comparison:**
   - After the loop, a final comparison of `maxCount` with `currentCount` is necessary to catch a sequence ending at the last element.

## Code

```javascript
function findMaxConsecutiveOnes(nums) {
    let maxCount = 0;
    let currentCount = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] === 1) {
            currentCount++;
        } else {
            maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, currentCount);
            currentCount = 0;
        }
    }

    // Final comparison in case the array ends with 1s
    maxCount = Math.max(maxCount, currentCount);

    return maxCount;
}

// Example Usage:
console.log(findMaxConsecutiveOnes([1,1,0,1,1,1])); // Output: 3
console.log(findMaxConsecutiveOnes([1,0,1,1,0,1])); // Output: 2
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of elements in the array. This is because the algorithm involves a single pass through the array.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are using a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size.


This approach is optimal in terms of both time and space complexities, making it efficient even for the upper limit of the input size constraints.
