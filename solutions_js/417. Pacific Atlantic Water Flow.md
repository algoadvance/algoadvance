[Leetcode 417. Pacific Atlantic Water Flow](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l417)
### Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` matrix of non-negative integers representing the height of each unit cell in a continent, the "Pacific Ocean" touches the left and top edges of the matrix and the "Atlantic Ocean" touches the right and bottom edges. 

Water can only flow in four directions (up, down, left, or right) from a cell to another one with height equal or lower.

Find the list of grid coordinates where water can flow to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the matrix contain cells with the same height?**
   - Yes, cells can have the same height.

2. **How should the result be formatted?**
   - The result should be a 2D list of grid coordinates.

3. **Is there any limit on the size of the matrix?**
   - Constraints are usually within reasonable limits, e.g., \(1 \leq m, n \leq 200\).

### Strategy

To determine the cells from which water can flow to both the Pacific and Atlantic oceans:
1. **DFS/BFS Traversal**: We start from the cells adjacent to both oceans and perform a depth-first search (DFS) from there.
2. **Marking Reachability**:
   - Use two matrices to keep track of cells from which water can reach the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans.
   - First, traverse from all cells adjacent to the Pacific Ocean and mark reachable cells.
   - Then, traverse from all cells adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean and mark reachable cells.
3. **Intersection**:
   - Cells that are reachable from both traversals are the ones from which water can flow to both oceans.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} heights
 * @return {number[][]}
 */
var pacificAtlantic = function(heights) {
    const m = heights.length;
    const n = heights[0].length;
    const pacificReachable = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(false));
    const atlanticReachable = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(false));
    const directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]];
    
    const dfs = (i, j, reachable) => {
        reachable[i][j] = true;
        for (const [di, dj] of directions) {
            const ni = i + di, nj = j + dj;
            if (ni >= 0 && ni < m && nj >= 0 && nj < n && !reachable[ni][nj] && heights[ni][nj] >= heights[i][j]) {
                dfs(ni, nj, reachable);
            }
        }
    }

    // Traverse from Pacific Ocean
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        dfs(i, 0, pacificReachable);
        dfs(i, n - 1, atlanticReachable);
    }
    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        dfs(0, j, pacificReachable);
        dfs(m - 1, j, atlanticReachable);
    }

    // Collect results: cells that can reach both oceans
    const result = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (pacificReachable[i][j] && atlanticReachable[i][j]) {
                result.push([i, j]);
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **DFS Traversal**: Each cell is processed once for both the Pacific and Atlantic Ocean traversals.
- **Overall Complexity**: `O(m * n)` where \(m\) is the number of rows and \(n\) is the number of columns in the matrix.

This ensures that the solution is efficient and can handle the problem constraints comfortably.
