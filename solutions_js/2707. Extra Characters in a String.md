[Leetcode 2707. Extra Characters in a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2707)
### Problem Statement:
You are given a string `s` and a dictionary of words `dictionary`. You need to determine the minimum number of extra characters left in the string `s` after you remove some number of non-overlapping substrings that are found in the dictionary.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What are the constraints on the length of the string `s` and the size of the `dictionary`?
    - Are there any constraints on the lengths of the words in `dictionary`?
    - What characters are allowed in the string `s` and the `dictionary` words?

2. **Output:**
    - Should the function return the minimum number of extra characters as a single integer?

3. **Multiple Occurrences:**
    - Can a word from the dictionary be used multiple times in different parts of the string `s`?

Let's assume the following constraints based on typical LeetCode problems:
- The length of string `s` is up to 1000.
- The number of words in the dictionary is up to 500.
- The length of each word in the dictionary is reasonably small (e.g., up to 20).
- Only lowercase English letters are used.

### Code:

Let's solve the problem using dynamic programming. The idea is to use a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` denotes the minimum number of extra characters in the substring `s[0..i-1]` (1-indexed).

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {string[]} dictionary
 * @return {number}
 */
var minExtraChar = function (s, dictionary) {
    const n = s.length;
    const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);

    // Create a set for quick lookup in the dictionary
    const dictSet = new Set(dictionary);

    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i - 1] + 1; // If no word ends at i, we add this character as extra

        for (let word of dictSet) {
            const len = word.length;
            if (i >= len && s.slice(i - len, i) === word) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[i - len]);
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[n];
};

// Example:
console.log(minExtraChar("leetscode", ["leet", "code", "leetcode"]));  // Output: 1
```

### Strategy:
1. Initialize a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of extra characters if we consider the substring `s[0..i-1]`.
2. Populate the DP array:
   - For each index `i` from 1 to `n`:
     - Start with the assumption that `s[i-1]` is an extra character.
     - Check every word in the dictionary:
       - If the word can end at position `i` in the string (by comparing it with `s.slice(i - len, i)` where `len` is the length of the word), update `dp[i]` by taking the minimum value of `dp[i]` and `dp[i - len]`.

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is `O(n * m * l)`, where `n` is the length of the string `s`, `m` is the number of words in the dictionary, and `l` is the average length of the words in the dictionary.
- Space complexity is `O(n)` for the dp array and `O(m * l)` for the dictionary set.
