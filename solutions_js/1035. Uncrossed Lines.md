[Leetcode 1035. Uncrossed Lines](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1035)
### Problem Statement

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return the maximum number of uncrossed lines you can draw between them. The lines drawn between the elements `nums1[i]` and `nums2[j]` are considered uncrossed if and only if:

- `nums1[i] == nums2[j]`, and
- the lines do not intersect (i.e., the lines drawn between the elements maintain the relative order of the elements).

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Clarify the Input Sizes**: 
    - What are the constraints on the lengths of `nums1` and `nums2`?
    - Answer: 
      ```
      - 1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 500
      - 1 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 2000
      ```

2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
    - What should be returned if either `nums1` or `nums2` is empty?
    - Answer: Return 0, as no lines can be drawn.

### Strategy

This problem is essentially a variation of the "Longest Common Subsequence" (LCS) problem. We'll use dynamic programming to build a 2D table `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the maximum number of uncrossed lines between the first `i` elements of `nums1` and the first `j` elements of `nums2`.

The recurrence relation will be as follows:
- If `nums1[i-1] == nums2[j-1]`, then `dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i-1][j-1]`
- Otherwise, `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`

The value at `dp[n][m]` (where `n` is the length of `nums1` and `m` is the length of `nums2`) will give the result.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(n * m)`, where `n` is the length of `nums1` and `m` is the length of `nums2`, due to the nested iteration through both arrays. The space complexity is also `O(n * m)` for storing the `dp` table.

### Code

```javascript
function maxUncrossedLines(nums1, nums2) {
    const n = nums1.length;
    const m = nums2.length;
    
    // Initialize a 2D dp array with (n+1) x (m+1) dimensions.
    const dp = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () => Array(m + 1).fill(0));
    
    // Fill the dp array.
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= m; j++) {
            if (nums1[i - 1] === nums2[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = 1 + dp[i - 1][j - 1];
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i - 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // The answer is at dp[n][m]
    return dp[n][m];
}

// Example usage:
const nums1 = [1, 4, 2];
const nums2 = [1, 2, 4];
console.log(maxUncrossedLines(nums1, nums2));  // Output: 2
```

In this example, the function successfully finds the maximum number of uncrossed lines that can be drawn between `nums1` and `nums2`.
