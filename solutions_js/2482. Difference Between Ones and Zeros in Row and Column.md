[Leetcode 2482. Difference Between Ones and Zeros in Row and Column](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2482)
### Problem Statement

You are given a `m x n` binary matrix `grid`, where each cell only contains `0` or `1`. A cell is called redundant if the difference between the number of `1`s and the number of `0`s in its row is not equal to the difference between the number of `1`s and the number of `0`s in its column. Your task is to create a matrix `diff` such that `diff[i][j]` is one of two values:

- 0 if the cell `grid[i][j]` is redundant.
- Otherwise the absolute difference between the number of `1`s and `0`s in its row.

Return the resulting matrix `diff`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should we do if the input matrix is empty?**
   - If the matrix is empty, the return value should be an empty matrix.

2. **Can you confirm the dimensions of the matrix?**
   - This will help in understanding the scale of the problem.

3. **What is the expected range of values for `m` and `n`?**
   - This will help in analyzing possible efficiency requirements.

### Strategy

1. **Calculate row and column statistics:**
   - For each row, calculate the number of `1`s and `0`s.
   - For each column, do the same.

2. **Construct the difference matrix:**
   - For each cell `(i, j)`, get the difference of the number of `1`s and `0`s in its row and column.
   - Populate the result matrix `diff` based on whether the difference in row equals the difference in column.

3. **Complexity Analysis:**
   - Calculating the number of `1`s and `0`s for all rows and columns takes `O(m * n)` time.
   - Constructing the matrix based on these statistics also takes `O(m * n)` time since we need to check each cell separately.

### Code

Here's the JavaScript implementation based on the above strategy:

```javascript
var onesMinusZeros = function(grid) {
    let m = grid.length;
    let n = grid[0].length;
    
    let onesRow = new Array(m).fill(0);
    let zerosRow = new Array(m).fill(0);
    let onesCol = new Array(n).fill(0);
    let zerosCol = new Array(n).fill(0);
    
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === 1) {
                onesRow[i]++;
                onesCol[j]++;
            } else {
                zerosRow[i]++;
                zerosCol[j]++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    let diff = new Array(m).fill(0).map(() => new Array(n).fill(0));
    
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            let rowDiff = onesRow[i] - zerosRow[i];
            let colDiff = onesCol[j] - zerosCol[j];
            if (rowDiff === colDiff) {
                diff[i][j] = Math.abs(rowDiff);
            } else {
                diff[i][j] = 0;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return diff;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Calculating statistics:** `O(m * n)`
- **Constructing the result matrix:** `O(m * n)`
- **Total Time Complexity:** `O(m * n)`

This ensures that we efficiently process the matrix and derive the required differences.
