[Leetcode 3149. Find the Minimum Cost Array Permutation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3149)
### Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 3149: Ensure to create a function that, given two arrays `A` and `B` each of size `n`, finds a permutation of `A` such that the sum of the absolute differences between the corresponding elements of `A` and `B` is minimized. 

The algorithm should return the minimum possible sum of absolute differences. 

The problem can be formally described as:

Given two arrays `A` and `B`:

- `A = [a1, a2, ..., an]`
- `B = [b1, b2, ..., bn]`

Find a permutation `P` of `A` such that the objective function `sum(|P[i] - B[i]|)` is minimized where `|x|` is the absolute value function.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are there any constraints on the values within arrays `A` and `B`?
2. Can the arrays `A` and `B` contain duplicate values?
3. What are the typical sizes of the arrays `A` and `B`?

Assuming that `A` and `B` can contain any integers, including duplicates, and have lengths in a typical range for algorithm problems (e.g., `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5`).

### Strategy

To minimize the sum of absolute differences, the optimal strategy is to sort both arrays and pair the corresponding elements in sorted order. This is because sorting ensures that each element in `A` is as close as possible to its counterpart in `B`, which helps reduce the sum of absolute differences.

#### Steps:

1. Sort array `A`.
2. Sort array `B`.
3. Compute the sum of absolute differences between corresponding elements of `A` and `B` after sorting.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} A
 * @param {number[]} B
 * @return {number}
 */

function minSumOfAbsoluteDifferences(A, B) {
    // Step 1: Sort both arrays
    A.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    B.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    // Step 2: Calculate the sum of absolute differences
    let minSum = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {
        minSum += Math.abs(A[i] - B[i]);
    }
    
    return minSum;
}

// Example usage:
const A = [4, 1, 8, 7];
const B = [2, 3, 6, 5];
console.log(minSumOfAbsoluteDifferences(A, B)); // Output: 6
```

### Time Complexity

1. Sorting both arrays `A` and `B`: This takes `O(n log n)`.
2. Computing the sum of absolute differences: This takes `O(n)`.

Therefore, the overall time complexity of this approach is `O(n log n)`, with `n` being the length of the arrays. This is efficient enough given typical constraints (e.g., `n` up to `10^5`).
