[Leetcode 1870. Minimum Speed to Arrive on Time](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1870)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `dist` of integers where `dist[i]` represents the distance between two consecutive stations. You are also given a floating-point number `hour` which indicates the time you have to reach the last station. Your task is to calculate the minimum speed `int` (in an integer form) you must travel to reach the last station exactly on or before the given `hour`.

If it is impossible to reach the last station in the given time, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `hour` be less than 1?**
   - Yes, `hour` can be less than or equal to the length of the `dist` array since we're dealing with floating-point numbers.
   
2. **Is the speed required to be an integer?**
   - Yes, the speed must be an integer.

3. **Is there any constraint on the length of the `dist` array or the values within the array?**
   - The length of `dist` and the values within are typically bounded by the problem's input constraints on LeetCode. Let's assume a reasonable limit based on competitive programming standards.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we'll use a binary search strategy. The idea is to find the minimum speed (an integer) that can get us to the destination on or before the given time.

1. **Binary Search Setup**:
   - The minimum possible speed is 1 (since speed has to be greater than 0).
   - The maximum possible speed can be initially set to a high value (e.g., `10^7`) to ensure the binary search covers all reasonable speeds.

2. **Travel Time Calculation**:
   - For each speed guess, calculate the total travel time.
   - For the first n-1 segments, the time taken should be rounded up to the next whole hour (since you can't depart before the next whole hour).
   - For the last segment, add the exact time needed (without rounding).

3. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - If the total computed travel time at the current speed guess is less than or equal to the allowed `hour`, then try a lower speed (move left in the binary search).
   - Otherwise, try a higher speed (move right in the binary search).

### Code
```javascript
var minSpeedOnTime = function(dist, hour) {
    // Helper function to compute the total travel time at a given speed
    const totalTime = (speed) => {
        let time = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < dist.length; ++i) {
            if (i == dist.length - 1) {
                time += dist[i] / speed; // Last segment exact time
            } else {
                time += Math.ceil(dist[i] / speed); // Other segments round up
            }
        }
        return time;
    };
    
    // Binary search for the minimum speed
    let left = 1, right = 10000000;
    let result = -1;
    
    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        const currentTotalTime = totalTime(mid);
        
        if (currentTotalTime <= hour) {
            result = mid; // Found a potential minimum speed
            right = mid - 1; // Try to find a lower valid speed
        } else {
            left = mid + 1; // Try higher speeds
        }
    }
    
    return result;
};
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity for this solution is:
- `O(n * log(maxSpeed))`, where `n` is the length of the `dist` array and `maxSpeed` is the upper bound for speed in our binary search (i.e., `10^7`).
  - `O(log(maxSpeed))` for the binary search.
  - `O(n)` for calculating the travel time for each speed guess.

Thus, the solution is efficient and should work within the limits of typical competitive programming constraints.
