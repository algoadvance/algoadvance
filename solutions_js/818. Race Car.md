[Leetcode 818. Race Car](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l818)
### Problem Statement

You are driving a vehicle that has a speed of `1` unit per second initially. The speed can be doubled using the `"A"` instruction, and it can be reversed with the `"R"` instruction, which sets the speed to `-1` unit per second. Given a target position `target`, you need to find the shortest sequence of instructions to reach that position.

- `"A"` (accelerate): Increases the speed of the car, and moves the car position by the current speed.
- `"R"` (reverse): Reverses the direction of the car. Set the speed in the opposite direction with the speed reset to `1` in the reversed direction.

Return the length of the smallest sequence of instructions needed to reach the target position.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can the car overshoot the target and then return to it by reversing?
   - Yes, the car can overshoot and return by reversing.

2. What should be the initial position and speed of the car?
   - The initial position is `0` and the initial speed is `1` unit per second.

3. Are there any constraints on the target value?
   - The target value will be a positive integer.

With this understanding, we can move on to the solution.

### Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search**: Given that this problem involves finding the shortest sequence of instructions, the Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach is suitable. We will explore all possible sequences of instructions systematically and find the shortest one.

2. **State Representation**: Each state will be represented by the current position, current speed, and instruction count. We will use a queue to manage BFS and a set to keep track of visited states to prevent redundant calculations.

3. **Transitions**:
   - Apply `"A"`: Move to the new position and update speed to double.
   - Apply `"R"`: Change the direction by setting speed to `Â±1` in the opposite direction.

### Code

```javascript
function racecar(target) {
    let queue = [[0, 1, 0]];  // [current position, current speed, steps taken]
    let visited = new Set();
    visited.add("0,1");
    
    while (queue.length) {
        const [pos, speed, steps] = queue.shift();
        
        if (pos === target) {
            return steps;
        }
        
        // Next state after applying "A" instruction
        let nextPosA = pos + speed;
        let nextSpeedA = speed * 2;
        let stateA = `${nextPosA},${nextSpeedA}`;
        
        if (!visited.has(stateA) && Math.abs(nextPosA) <= target * 2) {
            visited.add(stateA);
            queue.push([nextPosA, nextSpeedA, steps + 1]);
        }
        
        // Next state after applying "R" instruction
        let nextSpeedR = speed > 0 ? -1 : 1;
        let stateR = `${pos},${nextSpeedR}`;
        
        if (!visited.has(stateR) && Math.abs(pos) <= target * 2) {
            visited.add(stateR);
            queue.push([pos, nextSpeedR, steps + 1]);
        }
    }
    
    return -1;  // This line will never be reached based on the problem constraints
}

console.log(racecar(3));  // Output: 2
console.log(racecar(6));  // Output: 5
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the BFS approach can be represented in terms of the target `T`:

- **Time Complexity**: O(T log T). This is because, in the worst case, we might need to explore states incrementally closer to the target. Each state transition involves operations like doubling and reversing that contribute to logarithmic factors.
- **Space Complexity**: O(T log T). Similar to time complexity, storage for visited states and the queue grows with respect to the range of possible positions and speeds encountered in the BFS.

This solution ensures the car reaches the target position in the shortest sequence of instructions possible.
