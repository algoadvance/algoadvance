[Leetcode 1254. Number of Closed Islands](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1254)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` binary matrix `grid` where `0` represents land and `1` represents water. An island is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of `0`s and a closed island is an island **totally** (all left, right, top, bottom) surrounded by `1`s.

Return the number of closed islands.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Clarifications:** 
    - Is `grid` guaranteed to be non-empty?
    - What are the constraints on the size of `grid` ?
2. **Output Clarifications:** 
    - We need to return the number of islands that are fully surrounded by `1`s.

### Clarifications:
1. We assume `grid` will always be a non-empty 2D array.
2. There are no specific constraints specified for the size, but typical grid problems use sizes up to `100x100`.

### Strategy

The central task is to identify all `0`s (land) regions and check if they are closed islands (this needs all surrounding cells to be `1`s).

1. **Boundary Check:** 
   - Any land connected directly to the borders of the grid can't be part of a closed island.
   - We will first mark all `0`s connected to the borders to `1` to disregard them during the closure check.

2. **DFS/BFS Traversal:**
   - Use Depth First Search (DFS) to mark visited land cells and check the closure of an island.

3. **Count Closed Islands:**
   - After marking border lands, apply DFS again on the internal cells. If a `0` is found, initiate DFS to check whether it forms a closed island and count it.

### Code Implementation

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} grid
 * @return {number}
 */
var closedIsland = function(grid) {
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;

    // Function to carry out DFS and mark land connected to it
    const dfs = (i, j) => {
        if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= m || j >= n || grid[i][j] !== 0) return;
        grid[i][j] = 1;  // Mark the cell as visited by changing 0 to 1
        dfs(i + 1, j);
        dfs(i - 1, j);
        dfs(i, j + 1);
        dfs(i, j - 1);
    };

    // Mark all lands connected to the boundary as non-closed using DFS
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        if (grid[i][0] === 0) dfs(i, 0);  // First column
        if (grid[i][n - 1] === 0) dfs(i, n - 1);  // Last column
    }

    for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        if (grid[0][j] === 0) dfs(0, j);  // First row
        if (grid[m - 1][j] === 0) dfs(m - 1, j);  // Last row
    }

    let closedIslands = 0;

    // Check internal cells and count closed islands not touching the border
    for (let i = 1; i < m - 1; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j < n - 1; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === 0) {
                closedIslands++;
                dfs(i, j);  // Mark the entire island.
            }
        }
    }

    return closedIslands;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Marking Boundary Connected Lands:** O(m * n) - Each cell is visited at most once.
- **Counting Closed Islands:** O(m * n) - Each cell is visited at most once when counting and marking.

Overall time complexity is O(m * n), where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid. This ensures the solution is efficient even for larger grids within typical constraints.
