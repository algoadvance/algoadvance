[Leetcode 869. Reordered Power of 2](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l869)
### Problem Statement

Given a positive integer `n`, you need to determine if you can reorder its digits to form a power of 2. Return `true` if this is possible, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `n` be `0`?**
   - No, `n` is a positive integer according to the problem definition.
2. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - `n` can be as large as $10^9$.
3. **Are there any constraints on the digits of `n` other than it being a positive integer?**
   - No additional constraints; `n` can have any digits that a typical positive integer might have.
4. **What is the allowed runtime for the solution?**
   - The solution should be efficient enough to handle the upper limit of the input constraints, ideally in polynomial time.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {boolean}
 */

function reorderedPowerOf2(n) {
    // Convert the number to a sorted string representation of its digits
    const countDigits = (num) => num.toString().split('').sort().join('');
    
    // Sorted string representation of digits of n
    const target = countDigits(n);
    
    // Check against all powers of 2 up to the maximum constraint (2^29 is the largest power of 2 within 10^9)
    for (let i = 0; i < 30; i++) {
        if (target === countDigits(1 << i)) {
            return true;
        }
    }
    
    return false;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(reorderedPowerOf2(16));   // true, 16 is a power of 2
console.log(reorderedPowerOf2(10));   // false, cannot be rearranged to form a power of 2
console.log(reorderedPowerOf2(1));    // true, 1 is a power of 2 (2^0)
console.log(reorderedPowerOf2(24));   // true, 24 can be rearranged to 42 which is 2^5
```

### Strategy

1. **Digit Sorting**: Convert the given number `n` into a string, then sort the digits.
2. **Precompute Powers of 2**: Generate and store the sorted digit representations of powers of 2 up to $2^{29}$ (since $2^{30}$ exceeds $10^9$).
3. **Comparison**: Compare the sorted representation of `n` with each sorted representation of the powers of 2. If a match is found, return `true`.
4. **Return Result**: If no match is found after checking all relevant powers of 2, return `false`.

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is determined by:
1. **Sorting the Digits**: Sorting the digits of `n` takes \(O(d \log d)\) time where `d` is the number of digits.
2. **Checking Up to 30 Powers of 2**: We sort the digits of up to 30 numbers (powers of 2) each having up to 10 digits (since \( log_{10}(2^{30}) \approx 9 \)).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(d \log d)\), where \( d \) is the number of digits in the input number `n`. For practical purposes, \(d\) is maximized at around 10, making this approach efficient.
