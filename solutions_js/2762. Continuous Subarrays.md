[Leetcode 2762. Continuous Subarrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2762)
### Problem Statement
LeetCode Problem 2762: Continuous Subarrays

Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of non-empty subarrays where the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the subarray is at most 2.

A subarray is a contiguous part of an array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `nums` include negative numbers?**
   - Yes, `nums` can include negative numbers.
2. **What is the length range of `nums`?**
   - The length of `nums` can range from 1 to \(10^5\).
3. **What is the range of the integer values in `nums`?**
   - The integer values can range from \(-10^9\) to \(10^9\).

### Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, we will use a sliding window approach with a deque to keep track of the maximum and minimum values in the current window. This approach ensures that we can keep the window valid (i.e., the difference between the maximum and minimum values is at most 2) while scanning through the array.

1. **Initialize Deques and Pointers:** 
   - Use two deques, `maxDeque` and `minDeque`, to keep track of maximum and minimum values in the current window.
   - Initialize two pointers, `left` and `right`, both set to 0. The pointer `right` will expand the window, and `left` will contract it when the window becomes invalid.

2. **Expand and Contract the Window:**
   - For each position of `right`, insert the corresponding element into `maxDeque` and `minDeque` while maintaining the order properties that `maxDeque` always has the current maximum at the front, and `minDeque` always has the current minimum at the front.
   - If the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the current window exceeds 2, move the `left` pointer to make the window valid again.
   - Update the count of valid subarrays by adding the number of valid subarrays ending at the current `right`.

3. **Compute the Result:**
   - Return the accumulated count of valid subarrays when the whole array has been processed.

### Code
```javascript
var continuousSubarrays = function(nums) {
    let n = nums.length;
    let left = 0;
    let count = 0;
    let maxDeque = [];
    let minDeque = [];

    for (let right = 0; right < n; right++) {
        // Maintain maxDeque for maximum values
        while (maxDeque.length && nums[right] > maxDeque[maxDeque.length - 1])
            maxDeque.pop();
        maxDeque.push(nums[right]);

        // Maintain minDeque for minimum values
        while (minDeque.length && nums[right] < minDeque[minDeque.length - 1])
            minDeque.pop();
        minDeque.push(nums[right]);

        // Ensure current window is valid (difference between max and min <= 2)
        while (maxDeque[0] - minDeque[0] > 2) {
            if (maxDeque[0] === nums[left]) maxDeque.shift();
            if (minDeque[0] === nums[left]) minDeque.shift();
            left++;
        }

        // All subarrays ending at `right` and starting from `left` to `right` are valid
        count += (right - left + 1);
    }

    return count;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(continuousSubarrays([1, 2, 3, 4])); // Output: 7
console.log(continuousSubarrays([0, -1, 2])); // Output: 6
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the array `nums`. Each element is pushed and popped from the deques at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), mainly due to the space used by the deques.

This approach ensures that we scan through the array efficiently while maintaining the required conditions using the deques.
