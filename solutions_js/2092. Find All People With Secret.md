[Leetcode 2092. Find All People With Secret](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2092)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n` indicating there are `n` people numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are also given a 2D integer array `meetings`, where `meetings[i] = [xi, yi, timei]` indicates that person `xi` and person `yi` have met at `timei`. A person may and may not participate in multiple meetings at the same time.

Initially, only person `0` knows a secret. You need to determine all people who know the secret after all the meetings. A person knows the secret iff they got it directly from another person who already knows the secret at the time they met.

Return a list of all people that know the secret after all the meetings. You can return the list in any order.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Do the meetings have to be processed in any particular order?
2. Can there be duplicate entries in the meetings array?

### Strategy

1. **Organize the Meetings**: Sort the meetings by the time when they occur.
2. **Processing Meetings**: Iterate through the meetings in the order of their time:
    * For each time `t`, process all meetings happening at that time.
    * Track which people know the secret `currently`.
    * Use a Disjoint-Set Union (DSU) or Union-Find data structure to manage connections and propagation of the secret.
3. **Update Knowledge**: After processing all meetings at a given time, update the knowledge of the secret for each person based on the meetings and connected groups.
4. **Collect Results**: At the end, collect and return all people who have known the secret.

### Code

```javascript
class UnionFind {
    constructor(n) {
        this.parent = Array.from({ length: n }, (_, i) => i);
        this.rank = Array(n).fill(1);
    }

    find(a) {
        if (this.parent[a] !== a) {
            this.parent[a] = this.find(this.parent[a]);
        }
        return this.parent[a];
    }

    union(a, b) {
        const rootA = this.find(a);
        const rootB = this.find(b);
        
        if (rootA !== rootB) {
            if (this.rank[rootA] > this.rank[rootB]) {
                this.parent[rootB] = rootA;
            } else if (this.rank[rootA] < this.rank[rootB]) {
                this.parent[rootA] = rootB;
            } else {
                this.parent[rootB] = rootA;
                this.rank[rootA] += 1;
            }
        }
    }
}

function findAllPeople(n, meetings, firstPerson) {
    meetings.sort((a, b) => a[2] - b[2]);
    let uf = new UnionFind(n);
    uf.union(0, firstPerson);

    let i = 0;
    while (i < meetings.length) {
        let j = i;
        let time = meetings[i][2];
        let tempUf = new UnionFind(n);

        while (j < meetings.length && meetings[j][2] === time) {
            let [x, y, t] = meetings[j];
            tempUf.union(x, y);
            j++;
        }

        for (let k = i; k < j; k++) {
            let [x, y, t] = meetings[k];
            if (uf.find(x) === uf.find(0) || uf.find(y) === uf.find(0)) {
                uf.union(x, y);
            }
        }

        while (i < j) {
            i++;
        }
    }

    const result = [];
    for (let person = 0; person < n; person++) {
        if (uf.find(person) === uf.find(0)) {
            result.push(person);
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the meetings**: `O(m log m)` where `m` is the number of meetings.
- **Union-Find operations**: Nearly `O(m * α(n))`, where `α` is the inverse Ackermann function, which is practically constant.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(m log m + m * α(n))`, which is almost `O(m log m)` for most practical purposes.
