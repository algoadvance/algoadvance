[Leetcode 1927. Sum Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1927)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `num` representing a large integer. The first half of the string represents the first player's side, and the second half represents the second player's side. During each player's turn, they can replace a '?' character in their half of the string with any digit from '0' to '9'.

The game ends when there are no more '?' characters left. The goal is to make the sum of digits on each side as equal as possible. Assume that both players play optimally. If the sum is equal, the second player wins; if it is not, the first player wins. Return `true` if the first player wins, otherwise return `false`.

### Strategy

1. **Calculate the Sum of Known Digits:**
   - Divide the string into two halves.
   - Calculate the sum of the digits for both halves while ignoring the `?` characters.

2. **Count the '?' Characters:**
   - Count the number of `?` characters in both halves.

3. **Equate the Sums with Remaining Options:**
   - If both sides end up having the same sum without any `?` characters left, the second player wins.
   - Compare the range of possible values that can be formed by replacing `?` characters and determine if the first player can always ensure an unequal sum to win.

### Code

```javascript
var sumGame = function(num) {
    const n = num.length;
    let firstHalfSum = 0, secondHalfSum = 0;
    let firstHalfQuestionMarks = 0, secondHalfQuestionMarks = 0;

    // Divide into two halves
    for (let i = 0; i < n / 2; i++) {
        if (num[i] === '?') {
            firstHalfQuestionMarks++;
        } else {
            firstHalfSum += Number(num[i]);
        }
    }

    for (let i = n / 2; i < n; i++) {
        if (num[i] === '?') {
            secondHalfQuestionMarks++;
        } else {
            secondHalfSum += Number(num[i]);
        }
    }

    // Compute difference in sums and question marks
    let diff = firstHalfSum - secondHalfSum;
    let qdiff = secondHalfQuestionMarks - firstHalfQuestionMarks;

    // We have qdiff '?' characters difference which each can be [0..9] range
    return (diff - qdiff * 9 / 2) !== 0;
};
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the length of the input string?**
   - This helps in understanding the required optimization.
2. **What is the format of the string?**
   - We are assuming that the string length is always even and contains only digits and `?`.

### Time Complexity

1. **Time Complexity:**
   - The time complexity is O(n) where n is the length of the input string. This is because we only need to traverse the string a constant number of times to calculate sums and count `?` characters.

2. **Space Complexity:**
   - The space complexity is O(1) as we are using a fixed amount of additional space (few variables) regardless of the input size.

### Conclusion

The solution efficiently calculates whether the first or second player will win based on the optimal choices for replacing `?` characters. The problem boils down to comparing sums and the count of `?` characters in both halves of the string.
