[Leetcode 2145. Count the Hidden Sequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2145)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `differences` where `differences[i] = nums[i+1] - nums[i]`, and you are also given two integers `lower` and `upper`. 

- Your task is to find the number of possible values of the array `nums` that meet the following conditions:
  1. The length of `nums` is `differences.length + 1`.
  2. For `0 <= i < differences.length`, the condition `differences[i] = nums[i+1] - nums[i]` is satisfied.
  3. `lower <= nums[i] <= upper` for every `0 <= i < nums.length`.

Return the number of possible arrays `nums`. If there are no possible arrays, return `0`.

### Example:

```plaintext
Input: differences = [1, -3, 4], lower = 1, upper = 6
Output: 2

Explanation:
The possible values of nums are:
- [1, 2, -1, 3]
- [2, 3, 0, 4]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. What are the range limits for `differences`, `lower`, and `upper`? 
2. Should we consider large negative values and large positive values in `differences`? 
3. Can the array `nums` contain only integers, or can it have floating-point numbers as well?
4. Is there any constraint on the length of the `differences` array?

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to derive the array `nums` from the `differences` array and check whether each element in `nums` fits within the given `lower` and `upper` bounds. Here's a step-by-step approach:

1. **Initialize the nums array**:
   - Start with an initial value for `nums[0]` and compute the subsequent values of `nums` based on the `differences` array.

2. **Track the range**:
   - We need to ensure that all elements of `nums` are within the `lower` and `upper` bounds. To do this, we track the minimum and maximum possible values for `nums[0]` such that all generated `nums[i]` stay in the valid range.

3. **Count valid ranges**:
   - Calculate the range of valid starting values for `nums[0]` by adjusting the minimum and maximum cumulative sum obtained from `differences`.

4. **Return the count**:
   - The count of valid `nums[0]` values is the count of integers in the valid range.

## Code

```javascript
function countHiddenSequences(differences, lower, upper) {
    let minSum = 0;
    let maxSum = 0;
    let currentSum = 0;
    
    for (let diff of differences) {
        currentSum += diff;
        minSum = Math.min(minSum, currentSum);
        maxSum = Math.max(maxSum, currentSum);
    }
    
    let minStart = lower - minSum;
    let maxStart = upper - maxSum;
    
    if (minStart > maxStart) return 0;
    
    return maxStart - minStart + 1;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(countHiddenSequences([1, -3, 4], 1, 6)); // Output: 2
```

## Time Complexity

- The algorithm iterates over the `differences` array once to compute `minSum` and `maxSum`.
- This yields a time complexity of **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the `differences` array.

## Summary

The solution involves tracking the valid range of starting values for `nums[0]` by computing cumulative sums and ensuring that all elements in the derived `nums` array stay within the specified bounds. With this approach, we efficiently count the number of valid sequences using linear time complexity.
