[Leetcode 2926. Maximum Balanced Subsequence Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2926)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, your goal is to find the maximum possible sum of a balanced subsequence you can remove from the array. A balanced subsequence is defined as a subsequence whose sum of elements is equal to some value `k`, where there is at least one other subsequence with the same sum `k` that can also be removed from the array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of the array size (length of `nums`)?
2. Are there specific constraints on the values in the array (i.e., minimum and maximum values)?
3. Should we consider non-contiguous subsequences, or only contiguous ones?
4. Is there any specific return type expected, e.g., integer sum or array of values?

### Assumptions
1. The length of the array (`n`) is between 1 and 10^5.
2. The values in the array (`nums[i]`) are between -10^4 and 10^4.
3. The subsequence can be non-contiguous.
4. We are expected to return the sum as an integer.

### Code Strategy
1. **Precomputation of Subsequence Sums:** Use a hash map to keep track of the sums of all possible subsequences that can be formed. The key will be the sum, and the value will be the frequency of that sum.
2. **Identify Balanced Subsequence Sums:** Iterate through the hash map to find all sums that appear more than once.
3. **Calculate Maximum Possible Sum:** Out of the sums that appear more than once, find the one with the highest value.

### Code

```javascript
function maxBalancedSubsequenceSum(nums) {
    // HashMap to store sum frequencies
    const sumFrequency = new Map();

    // Helper function to find all subsequences sums
    function findAllSubsequencesSums(arr, index = 0, currentSum = 0) {
        if (index === arr.length) return;
        
        // Include the current element
        let newSum = currentSum + arr[index];
        sumFrequency.set(newSum, (sumFrequency.get(newSum) || 0) + 1);
        
        // Recurse by including the current element
        findAllSubsequencesSums(arr, index + 1, newSum);

        // Recurse by excluding the current element
        findAllSubsequencesSums(arr, index + 1, currentSum);
    }

    // Start finding sums from index 0
    findAllSubsequencesSums(nums);

    // Find the maximum sum with frequency > 1
    let maxSum = Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY;
    for (const [sum, count] of sumFrequency.entries()) {
        if (count > 1 && sum > maxSum) {
            maxSum = sum;
        }
    }

    return maxSum === Number.NEGATIVE_INFINITY ? 0 : maxSum;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(maxBalancedSubsequenceSum([1, -1, 2, 3, -2, 2]));  // Expected output: sum of maximum balanced subsequence
```

### Strategy
1. **Generate All Subsequence Sums:** Use a helper recursive function to generate all possible sums of subsequences in the array, updating a `sumFrequency` map each time a new sum is computed.
2. **Track Frequencies:** For each sum encountered, update the frequency count in the hash map.
3. **Identify Maximum Balanced Sum:** Iterate through the hash map to find the highest sum that appears more than once (has more than one subsequence that results in that sum).

### Time Complexity
- **Generating Subsequences:** O(2^n) as there are 2^n possible subsequences for an array of size `n`.
- **Hash Map Operations:** O(1) average time for insert and lookup operations.
- **Iterating through Hash Map:** O(m) where `m` is the number of unique sums, which is upper bounded by `2^n` in the worst case.

The overall complexity can be high due to generating subsequences, but the hash map helps in efficient look-up and update operations for sums. This approach may need optimization for very large inputs.
