[Leetcode 1718. Construct the Lexicographically Largest Valid Sequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1718)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n`. Your task is to construct a sequence with length `2 * n - 1` where each integer from `1` to `n` appears exactly two times, and the distance between the two occurrences of the integer `i` is exactly `i`. The sequence must be the lexicographically largest valid sequence possible.

Return the resulting sequence. If there is no valid sequence, return an empty array.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What does "lexicographically largest" mean in this context?**
   - It means that if you compare two sequences element by element from left to right, the sequence that has the largest number at the first differing position is considered larger.

2. **What should be the length of the sequence?**
   - The length of the sequence should be `2 * n - 1`.

3. **What if no valid sequence exists?**
   - We need to return an empty array in such cases.

### Strategy

1. **Backtracking Algorithm:** Given the constraint, we can use backtracking to explore possible sequences.
2. **Placement Rules:** For number `i`, we need to place it at two indices `k` and `k + i + 1`.
3. **Backtracking Mechanism:**
   - Start with the highest number and attempt to place it in its valid slots.
   - If a number cannot be placed, backtrack and try the next available slot for the earlier numbers.
4. **Pruning:** If a number cannot be placed at any position, prune that branch and backtrack immediately.

### Code

```javascript
function constructDistancedSequence(n) {
    const result = Array(2 * n - 1).fill(0);
    const used = Array(n + 1).fill(false);

    const backtrack = (index) => {
        if (index === 2 * n - 1) return true;
        if (result[index] !== 0) return backtrack(index + 1);

        for (let num = n; num >= 1; num--) {
            if (used[num]) continue;
            const secondPosition = index + num + 1;
            if (num === 1) {
                result[index] = num;
                used[num] = true;
                if (backtrack(index + 1)) return true;
                result[index] = 0;
                used[num] = false;
            } else if (secondPosition < result.length && result[secondPosition] === 0) {
                result[index] = result[secondPosition] = num;
                used[num] = true;
                if (backtrack(index + 1)) return true;
                result[index] = result[secondPosition] = 0;
                used[num] = false;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }

    backtrack(0);
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Worst Case Time Complexity:** O(N!), where N is the number of recursive calls. This can happen in a very unlucky situation where all numbers must be tried in all positions.
- **Best Case:** O(N), but this is highly dependent on the ability to quickly prune branches during backtracking.

By leveraging backtracking with a focus on lexicographically larger sequences, the provided solution aims to efficiently place numbers following the given constraints.
