[Leetcode 2588. Count the Number of Beautiful Subarrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2588)
## Problem Statement
You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`. A subarray of `nums` is called beautiful if it contains exactly `k` different integers.

Return the number of beautiful subarrays in the array `nums`.

A subarray is a contiguous non-empty sequence of elements within an array.

## Clarifying Questions
Before we proceed, let's clarify the problem statement with a few questions:
1. Should the value of `k` be provided as an additional input?
2. Can the array contain negative integers?
3. Is there a constraint on the size of the input array `nums`?

Assuming k is provided as an additional input, the following solution is designed to handle arrays with both positive and negative integers and no specific constraints on the size of `nums`.

## Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently:
1. Utilize sliding window technique to keep track of the number of distinct integers within the current window.
2. Expand the window by including the next element on the right until the window contains exactly `k` different integers.
3. Once a valid window is found, count the number of subarrays ending with the current element that satisfies the condition by calculating possible subarrays.
4. Move the left end of the window to reduce the number of elements and keep track of the count of elements to ensure exactly `k` distinct integers.
5. Continue this process until the end of the array is reached.

We will use a HashMap to keep track of the frequency of elements in the current window.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
function countBeautifulSubarrays(nums, k) {
    const n = nums.length;
    let left = 0;
    let count = 0;
    const freqMap = new Map();
    
    for (let right = 0; right < n; right++) {
        // Include nums[right] into the frequency map
        freqMap.set(nums[right], (freqMap.get(nums[right]) || 0) + 1);
        
        // While the window contains more than k distinct integers, shrink from the left
        while (freqMap.size > k) {
            freqMap.set(nums[left], freqMap.get(nums[left]) - 1);
            if (freqMap.get(nums[left]) === 0) {
                freqMap.delete(nums[left]);
            }
            left++;
        }
        
        // Count all the subarrays ending at 'right' with exactly 'k' distinct integers
        if (freqMap.size === k) {
            let tempLeft = left;
            const tempMap = new Map(freqMap);
            while (tempMap.size === k) {
                count++;
                tempMap.set(nums[tempLeft], tempMap.get(nums[tempLeft]) - 1);
                if (tempMap.get(nums[tempLeft]) === 0) {
                    tempMap.delete(nums[tempLeft]);
                }
                tempLeft++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

// Example usage:
const nums = [1, 2, 1, 2, 3];
const k = 2;
console.log(countBeautifulSubarrays(nums, k)); // Output depends on the specific implementation details
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is `O(n)`:
- Each element is processed at most twice (once when expanding the window and once when contracting it).
- Maintaining and updating the frequency map is `O(1)` per operation.

Thus, this ensures an optimal solution for large input sizes within acceptable performance limits.
