[Leetcode 496. Next Greater Element I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l496)
### Problem Statement
You are given two arrays (with no duplicates) `nums1` and `nums2` where `nums1` is a subset of `nums2`. For each element in `nums1`, find the next greater element in `nums2`. The next greater element of an element `x` in `nums2` is the first greater element to its right. If it does not exist, the output for that element should be `-1`.

- Example 1:
    - **Input:** `nums1 = [4,1,2]`, `nums2 = [1,3,4,2]`
    - **Output:** `[-1,3,-1]`
    - **Explanation:**
        - For number `4` in `num1`, there is no next greater number in `nums2` at its right.
        - For number `1` in `num1`, the next greater number in `nums2` is `3`.
        - For number `2` in `num1`, there is no next greater number in `nums2` at its right.
- Example 2:
    - **Input:** `nums1 = [2,4]`, `nums2 = [1,2,3,4]`
    - **Output:** `[3,-1]`
    - **Explanation:**
        - For number `2` in `num1`, the next greater number in `nums2` is `3`.
        - For number `4` in `num1`, there is no next greater number in `nums2` at its right.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Are there any constraints on the size of the arrays?
    - The constraints would typically be provided, but assume they are reasonable enough to fit in memory.
2. Should we account for negative numbers in `nums1` and `nums2`?
    - Yes, we should account for any integer values.

### Strategy
To efficiently solve this problem, we can use a **monotonic stack**:
1. Traverse `nums2` from left to right.
2. Use a stack to keep track of elements for which we haven't found the next greater element yet.
3. As we process each element in `nums2`, we check the top of the stack:
    - If the current element is larger than the top of the stack, we've found the next greater element for the top of the stack element.
    - Continue this process until the stack is either empty or the top of the stack is greater than the current element.
4. Push the current element onto the stack.
5. Use a map to store the next greater element for each element in `nums2`.
6. Finally, build the result for `nums1` using this map. If an element from `nums1` is not in the map, the result for that element is `-1`.

### Code
```javascript
function nextGreaterElement(nums1, nums2) {
    const nextGreaterMap = new Map();
    const stack = [];
    
    for (let num of nums2) {
        while (stack.length > 0 && stack[stack.length - 1] < num) {
            nextGreaterMap.set(stack.pop(), num);
        }
        stack.push(num);
    }
    
    return nums1.map(num => nextGreaterMap.get(num) || -1);
}

// Example usage
console.log(nextGreaterElement([4,1,2], [1,3,4,2])); // [-1, 3, -1]
console.log(nextGreaterElement([2,4], [1,2,3,4]));   // [3, -1]
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n + m)` where `n` is the length of `nums2` and `m` is the length of `nums1`. The traversal of `nums2` is `O(n)` and constructing the result for `nums1` is `O(m)`.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` for the stack and map, which store elements from `nums2`.
