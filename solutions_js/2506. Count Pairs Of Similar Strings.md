[Leetcode 2506. Count Pairs Of Similar Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2506)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `words`. A string is considered similar to another string if it is composed of the same characters.

Return the number of pairs `(i, j)` (where `0 <= i < j < words.length`) such that the two strings `words[i]` and `words[j]` are similar.

**Example:**
```js
Input: words = ["aba","aabb","abcd","bac","aabc"]
Output: 2
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the definition of similar in this context?**
   - Two strings are similar if they are composed of the same characters. The order does not matter, nor does the frequency of each character.
   
2. **What should the function return if there are no similar strings?**
   - It should return `0`.

3. **Can the strings be empty?**
   - Yes, it's possible for strings in the array to be empty, though this is a non-issue since empty strings are trivially similar to each other.

4. **What is the maximum length of the `words` array and the strings within it?**
   - Assuming typical constraints for coding challenges, let's consider the input array length `n` and string length to be reasonably large but not exceed practical bounds (e.g., `n <= 1000` and length of strings also within `1000`).

## Strategy

1. **Canonical Form Representation:**
   - To identify similar strings efficiently, convert each string into its canonical form, which is a sorted list of unique characters from that string.
   
2. **Hash Map for Counting Similar Canonical Forms:**
   - Use a hash map to store the frequency of each canonical form.
   
3. **Count Pairs Efficiently:**
   - Iterate over the map to count the pairs `(i, j)` for each canonical form. If a form appears `count` times, the number of pairs is given by combinations `count * (count - 1) / 2`.

## Code

```js
function countPairsOfSimilarStrings(words) {
    const getCanonicalForm = (word) => {
        return Array.from(new Set(word)).sort().join('');
    };

    const canonicalMap = new Map();

    // Populate the map with canonical form counts
    for (let word of words) {
        const canonicalForm = getCanonicalForm(word);
        if (canonicalMap.has(canonicalForm)) {
            canonicalMap.set(canonicalForm, canonicalMap.get(canonicalForm) + 1);
        } else {
            canonicalMap.set(canonicalForm, 1);
        }
    }

    // Calculate the number of pairs
    let countPairs = 0;
    for (let [, count] of canonicalMap) {
        if (count > 1) {
            countPairs += (count * (count - 1)) / 2;
        }
    }

    return countPairs;
}

// Example usage:
const words = ["aba","aabb","abcd","bac","aabc"];
console.log(countPairsOfSimilarStrings(words)); // Output: 2
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Canonical Form Calculation:**
   - Each string transformation to a canonical form involves `O(k log k)` where `k` is the length of the string due to sorting, plus the unique character extraction which is `O(k)`.
   
2. **Overall Complexity:**
   - Constructing the canonical form for all strings: `O(n * k log k)` where `n` is the number of strings.
   - Counting pairs using the hash map: `O(n)`.
   
   Hence, the overall time complexity is `O(n * k log k)`, where `n` is the number of strings and `k` is the average length of the strings.
