[Leetcode 1491. Average Salary Excluding the Minimum and Maximum Salary](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1491)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of unique integers representing the salaries of various employees. You need to calculate the average salary of employees excluding the minimum and maximum salary.

Given an array `salaries` where `salaries[i]` is the salary of the `i`-th employee, return the average salary excluding the minimum and maximum salary.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the array have less than 3 elements?** 
   - No, according to the problem description, you can assume that the array will always contain at least 3 salaries.
2. **Are the salaries always unique?**
   - Yes, it is mentioned that the integers in the array are unique.
3. **Should the result be an integer or can it be a floating-point number?**
   - Since we're dealing with averages, the result should be a floating-point number.

### Strategy
1. **Identify the minimum and maximum salaries** in the array.
2. **Sum up all the salaries** in the array.
3. **Subtract the minimum and maximum salaries** from the total sum.
4. **Divide the result by the number of remaining salaries** (i.e., `length of array - 2`).

### Code

```javascript
function average(salary) {
    // Find the minimum and maximum salary
    let minSalary = Math.min(...salary);
    let maxSalary = Math.max(...salary);
    
    // Calculate the sum of all salaries
    let totalSum = salary.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
    
    // Subtract the minimum and maximum salary from total sum
    let adjustedSum = totalSum - minSalary - maxSalary;
    
    // Calculate the average salary excluding min and max
    let average = adjustedSum / (salary.length - 2);
    
    return average;
}
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Identifying the minimum and maximum salary**: `O(n)` where `n` is the number of elements in the `salary` array.
2. **Summing up all salaries**: `O(n)`.
3. **Other operations**: `O(1)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**. This is efficient given that we need to examine each salary at least once for both summing and finding the min and max values.
