[Leetcode 989. Add to Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l989)
## Problem Statement
The problem is to add an integer `k` to an array-form integer `num`:

For a non-negative integer `X`, the array-form of `X` is an array of its digits in left to right order. For example, if `X = 1231`, then the array form is `[1, 2, 3, 1]`.

Given an array-form `num` of a non-negative integer `X`, return the array-form of the integer `X + k`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: num = [1,2,0,0], k = 34
Output: [1,2,3,4]
Explanation: 1200 + 34 = 1234
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: num = [2,7,4], k = 181
Output: [4,5,5]
Explanation: 274 + 181 = 455
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: num = [2,1,5], k = 806
Output: [1,0,2,1]
Explanation: 215 + 806 = 1021
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= num.length <= 10^4`
- `0 <= num[i] <= 9`
- `num` does not contain any leading zeros except for the number 0 itself.
- `1 <= k <= 10^4`

## Clarifying Questions
- Can `k` be a negative number?
  - No, `k` is always a non-negative integer as defined in the problem.
  
- Can `num` have leading zeros?
  - `num` only represents non-negative integers and does not contain leading zeros unless it is the actual number zero.

## Strategy
1. Convert the array-form `num` to an integer.
2. Add `k` to this integer value.
3. Convert the result back to the array-form.
4. Return the resulting array.

## Code
Here is the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function addToArrayForm(num, k) {
    // Convert the array-form integer to a string
    let numStr = num.join('');
    
    // Convert the string to a BigInt to handle large numbers
    let sum = BigInt(numStr) + BigInt(k);
    
    // Convert the sum back to string so we can create an array from it
    let sumStr = sum.toString();
    
    // Create the array-form of integer from the sum
    let result = sumStr.split('').map(Number);
    
    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n + m) where `n` is the length of `num` and `m` is the number of digits in `k` (since we have to handle each digit of `num` and `k` while converting to/from strings and arrays).

- **Space Complexity:** O(1) extra space, ignoring the space used for the output array since we are only using primitive variables and the intermediate string representations.
