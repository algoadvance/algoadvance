[Leetcode 1824. Minimum Sideway Jumps](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1824)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 3-lane road represented by an array `obstacles` of length `n`. Each `obstacles[i]` (0-indexed) represents a road block in lane `(obstacles[i] - 1)` at position `i`. If `obstacles[i]` is 0, then there are no obstacles at that position. There is a frog initially in the second lane (lane 2, index 1 of the 3 lanes) at position 0. 

The frog wants to travel to the end of the road (position `n - 1`), and you should determine the minimum number of sideways jumps the frog needs to reach the last position.

### Constraints:
- `n == obstacles.length`
- `1 <= n <= 5 * 10^5`
- `0 <= obstacles[i] <= 3`

You need to define a function that returns the minimum number of sideways jumps required to travel to the end of the road.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the frog move forward, and sideways in the same move?
   - No, the frog can only move forward and then sideways.

2. What happens if an obstacle is at position `i` in the initial lane (lane 2)?
   - The frog must jump sideways either to lane 1 or lane 3 to avoid the obstacle and continue moving forward.

## Strategy

1. Initialize an array `dp` to keep track of the minimum number of jumps required to reach each position in lanes 1, 2, and 3. Start with `dp = [1, 0, 1]` indicating that being in lane 2 requires 0 sideway jumps initially, while moving to lanes 1 or 3 initially would require 1 sideway jump.

2. Iterate through the `obstacles` array, updating the `dp` array based on the presence of obstacles and possible minimum number of sideways jumps from the previous position.

3. At each position `i`, if there's an obstacle in the current lane, set its possible jumps to a large number (Infinity). Update each lane's possible jumps by considering jumps from other lanes if a sideways jump is needed to avoid obstacles.

4. Continue updating until the last position in `obstacles` is processed.

5. The minimum number of jumps required will be the minimum value among the possible jumps in the three lanes at the last position.

## Code

```javascript
function minSideJumps(obstacles) {
    const n = obstacles.length;

    // Initial dp array for positions 0, at lanes 1, 2, and 3
    let dp = [1, 0, 1];

    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        const obstacle = obstacles[i];
        let newDp = [Infinity, Infinity, Infinity];

        // Update newDp - based on the current dp values
        for (let lane = 1; lane <= 3; lane++) {
            if (obstacle !== lane) {
                newDp[lane - 1] = Math.min(dp[lane - 1], 
                                           1 + Math.min(...[1, 2, 3].filter(l => l !== lane && obstacle !== l).map(l => dp[l - 1])));
            }
        }

        dp = newDp;
    }

    return Math.min(...dp);
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\), where we iterate through the obstacle array once.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\), as we use a fixed-size array to keep track of the minimum jumps for each of the three lanes.

This solution ensures that the problem is addressed efficiently within the constraints.
