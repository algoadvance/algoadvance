[Leetcode 733. Flood Fill](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l733)
### Problem Statement

You are given an image represented by a 2D array of integers, where `image[i][j]` represents the pixel value of the image.

You are also given three integers `sr`, `sc`, and `newColor`. You should perform a "flood fill" on the image starting from the pixel `image[sr][sc]`.

To perform a "flood fill," consider the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to the starting pixel of the same color as the starting pixel, plus any pixels connected 4-directionally to those pixels (also with the same color), and so on. Replace the color of all of the aforementioned pixels with `newColor`.

Return the modified image after performing the flood fill.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: image = [[1,1,1],[1,1,0],[1,0,1]], sr = 1, sc = 1, newColor = 2
Output: [[2,2,2],[2,2,0],[2,0,1]]
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can the image contain more than one color?
   - **A**: Yes, the image can contain multiple different colors.

2. **Q**: What should we do if the starting pixel already has the `newColor`?
   - **A**: If the starting pixel already has the `newColor`, we can directly return the image as no change is needed.

3. **Q**: Is the image always going to be rectangular (i.e., all rows have the same number of columns)?
   - **A**: Yes, the image will always be rectangular.

4. **Q**: Can we assume the inputs are always within valid bounds?
   - **A**: Yes, you can assume `sr` and `sc` will always be valid indices in the image.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Checks**:
   - If the start pixel's color is already the same as `newColor`, return the original image.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**:
   - Use a recursive DFS approach to traverse and color the image.
   - Begin the DFS from the starting pixel `image[sr][sc]`.
   - If the current pixel is of the same color as the initial pixel's color, change it to `newColor`.
   - Recursively apply DFS in all 4 directions (up, down, left, right).

3. **Boundary Conditions**:
   - Ensure the DFS does not go out of bounds of the image.
   - Check each pixel to ensure it's the same color as the original starting pixel's color before changing it to `newColor`.

### Code

```javascript
const floodFill = (image, sr, sc, newColor) => {
    const originalColor = image[sr][sc];

    // Check if the newColor is the same as the originalColor
    if (originalColor === newColor) return image;

    const numRows = image.length;
    const numCols = image[0].length;

    // Recursive DFS function
    const dfs = (r, c) => {
        // Base case: if out of bounds or the color is not the same as originalColor
        if (r < 0 || r >= numRows || c < 0 || c >= numCols || image[r][c] !== originalColor) {
            return;
        }

        // Change the color of the current pixel
        image[r][c] = newColor;

        // Recursively call dfs for all 4 directions (up, down, left, right)
        dfs(r - 1, c); // up
        dfs(r + 1, c); // down
        dfs(r, c - 1); // left
        dfs(r, c + 1); // right
    };

    // Start flood fill from the original pixel
    dfs(sr, sc);

    return image;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(floodFill([[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 0], [1, 0, 1]], 1, 1, 2));
// Output: [[2, 2, 2], [2, 2, 0], [2, 0, 1]]
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(N)**, where N is the number of pixels in the image. In the worst case, the function will visit every pixel once.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is **O(N)** as well, due to the recursion stack in the depth-first search. For a fully connected region, the recursion stack depth can grow to the number of pixels in the image.
