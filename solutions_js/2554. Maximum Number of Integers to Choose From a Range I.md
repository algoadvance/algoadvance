[Leetcode 2554. Maximum Number of Integers to Choose From a Range I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2554)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integers `n` and `sum`. You need to choose the maximum number of distinct integers from the range `[1, n]` such that the sum of these integers is less than or equal to `sum`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of `n` and `sum`?**
   - Typically, constraints would be provided in the problem statement. We will assume reasonable constraints, for example: `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5` and `0 ≤ sum ≤ 10^9`.

2. **What should be the output if no integer can be chosen?**
   - The output should be `0`, as no integers can be chosen.

3. **Can `n` be 0?**
   - Typically, `n` starts from 1 based on the problem statement.

### Strategy

1. We need to choose the maximum number of distinct integers from the range `[1, n]` such that their sum does not exceed `sum`.

2. Start with the smallest integers because their sum will be smaller, allowing us to include more integers before the sum exceeds the target.

3. Use a greedy approach:
   - Start with the smallest integer (1) and keep adding the next integer until the cumulative sum exceeds `sum`.

4. Keep a running tally of the sum as integers are added from 1 to n.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case where we iterate from 1 to `n` checking the sum.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) as we are only using a few extra variables.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @param {number} sum
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxCount = function(n, sum) {
    let currentSum = 0;
    let count = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (currentSum + i <= sum) {
            currentSum += i;
            count++;
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }

    return count;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(maxCount(5, 10)); // Output: 4 (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 <= 10)
console.log(maxCount(3, 4));  // Output: 2 (1 + 2 <= 4)
console.log(maxCount(10, 0)); // Output: 0 (no integers can be chosen as the sum is 0)
console.log(maxCount(10, 55)); // Output: 10 (1 + 2 + 3 + ... + 10 = 55)
```

### Explanation

1. Initialize `currentSum` to 0 to keep track of the cumulative sum.
2. Initialize `count` to 0 to keep track of how many integers have been chosen.
3. Iterate through each integer `i` from 1 to `n`:
   - If adding `i` to `currentSum` does not exceed `sum`, add `i` to `currentSum` and increment `count`.
   - If adding `i` would exceed `sum`, break out of the loop since any subsequent numbers will only increase the sum further.
4. Finally, return `count`, which represents the maximum number of integers that can be chosen.
