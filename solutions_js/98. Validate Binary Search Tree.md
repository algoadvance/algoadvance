[Leetcode 98. Validate Binary Search Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l98)
### Problem Statement

Given the root of a binary tree, determine if it is a valid binary search tree (BST). A valid BST is defined as follows:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys less than the node's key.
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with keys greater than the node's key.
- Both the left and right subtrees must also be binary search trees.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of node values?**
   - The node values can be any integer, positive or negative.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the tree's structure?**
   - The tree can be skewed or balanced; there are no structural constraints beyond the BST properties.

3. **Is it permissible to use additional helper functions or data structures?**
   - Yes, you can use helper functions and additional data structures as needed.

4. **Can there be duplicate values in the tree?**
   - No, BSTs by definition do not contain duplicate values.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
 *     this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
 *     this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left)
 *     this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right)
 * }
 */

/**
 * @param {TreeNode} root
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var isValidBST = function(root) {
    const validate = (node, low, high) => {
        // An empty node is valid
        if (node === null) {
            return true;
        }
        
        // Check the current node value
        if (node.val <= low || node.val >= high) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // Recursively validate the left and right subtrees
        return validate(node.left, low, node.val) &&
               validate(node.right, node.val, high);
    }
    
    // Initialize the recursion with the entire range of valid integer values
    return validate(root, -Infinity, Infinity);
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Recursive Validation:**
   - Use a helper function `validate` that takes a node and the current allowable range of values (`low` and `high`) for that node.
   - For each node, ensure its value is greater than the `low` bound and less than the `high` bound.
   - Recursively check the left subtree with an updated `high` bound (current node's value) and the right subtree with an updated `low` bound (current node's value).

2. **Base Case:**
   - If the node is `null` (empty tree or reached the end of a branch), it is considered a valid BST.

3. **Recursive Case:**
   - Compare the node's value against the bounds. If the value is within the allowed range, recursively validate its left and right subtrees with updated bounds.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(h), where `h` is the height of the tree. The maximum space used by the recursion stack is proportional to the height of the tree. In the worst case (completely unbalanced tree), `h` could be `n`. In the best case (completely balanced tree), `h` is `log(n)`.

This approach ensures an efficient and clear validation of the BST property using recursion and range checking.
