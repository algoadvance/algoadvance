[Leetcode 2275. Largest Combination With Bitwise AND Greater Than Zero](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2275)
### Problem Statement
You need to find the size of the largest subset of a given array such that the Bitwise AND of all integers in the subset is greater than zero. 

### Clarifying Questions
- **Q:** What is the range of the integer values in the array?
  - **A:** The problem does not specify limits for the values, but typically values can be of standard 32-bit integer type.
  
- **Q:** Can the array contain duplicate elements?
  - **A:** Yes, the array can contain duplicates.
  
- **Q:** What should be returned if all elements in the array are zeros?
  - **A:** If all elements are zero, the largest subset size with a Bitwise AND greater than zero is zero.

### Strategy
1. **Bitwise Operation Insight:**
    - The Bitwise AND of a subset of numbers is greater than zero only if there exists at least one bit position where all numbers in the subset have a bit set to 1.
2. **Count Occurrences of Each Bit Position:**
    - Iterate through each bit position and count how many numbers have the bit set to 1.
3. **Determine the Largest Subset:**
    - The largest possible subset that satisfies the condition is the maximum count of numbers having the same bit position set to 1.

### Code
```javascript
function largestCombination(candidates) {
    let maxSubsetSize = 0;

    // Examine each bit position from 0 to 31
    for (let bit = 0; bit < 32; bit++) {
        let currentBitCount = 0;
        
        for (let candidate of candidates) {
            // Check if the bit-th bit is set to 1
            if ((candidate & (1 << bit)) !== 0) {
                currentBitCount++;
            }
        }

        // Update the maximum subset size found
        maxSubsetSize = Math.max(maxSubsetSize, currentBitCount);
    }

    return maxSubsetSize;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Iteration Over Bits:** We iterate over 32 bit positions (`O(1)`, since this is a fixed number of iterations).
- **Iteration Over Candidates:** For each bit, we iterate over all candidates to count the number of 1s (`O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array).
- **Overall Time Complexity:** Since iterating over bits is constant (`32 * n`), the overall time complexity is `O(n)`.

This approach efficiently counts the bit occurrences and finds the largest subset where the Bitwise AND is greater than zero.
