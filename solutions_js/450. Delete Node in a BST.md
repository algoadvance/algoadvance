[Leetcode 450. Delete Node in a BST](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l450)
### Problem Statement

You are given the root of a binary search tree (BST) and an integer key. You need to delete the node with the given key in the BST and return the root of the modified tree. Ensure that the properties of the binary search tree are maintained after the deletion.

**Example:**

Given BST:
```
     5
    / \
   3   6
  / \   \
 2   4   7
```

Key to delete: `3`

Modified BST:
```
     5
    / \
   4   6
  /     \
 2       7
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the key to be deleted be guaranteed to always exist in the tree?**
   - No, the key might not always exist, so you should handle this case.
   
2. **Can the tree be empty initially?**
   - Yes, the tree can be empty, in which case the root is simply `null`.

3. **Are there any constraints on the values of the nodes in the BST?**
   - The value of each node lies in the range of `-10^9` to `10^9`.

### Strategy

1. **Find the Node:**
   - Recursively find the node that matches the given key.

2. **Delete the Node:**
   - If the node has no children, simply remove it.
   - If the node has one child, replace the node with its child.
   - If the node has two children, find the node's inorder successor (the smallest node in the right subtree). Replace the nodeâ€™s value with the inorder successor's value, and delete the inorder successor node from the right subtree.

### Code

```javascript
var deleteNode = function(root, key) {
    if (root === null) return root;

    if (key < root.val) {
        root.left = deleteNode(root.left, key);
    } else if (key > root.val) {
        root.right = deleteNode(root.right, key);
    } else {
        if (root.left === null) return root.right;
        if (root.right === null) return root.left;

        let successor = findMin(root.right);
        root.val = successor.val;
        root.right = deleteNode(root.right, successor.val);
    }

    return root;
};

function findMin(node) {
    while (node.left !== null) {
        node = node.left;
    }
    return node;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Finding the node:** O(h) where h is the height of the tree.
- **Deleting the node:** O(h) where h is the height of the tree (includes finding the inorder successor and deleting it).

Overall, the time complexity is **O(h)**, where h is the height of the tree.
For a balanced BST, the height h is **O(log n)**, where n is the number of nodes.
For a skewed BST, the height h is **O(n)**.

The space complexity is **O(h)** due to the recursive stack usage during the deletion process.
