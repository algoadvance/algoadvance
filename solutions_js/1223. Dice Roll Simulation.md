[Leetcode 1223. Dice Roll Simulation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1223)
## Problem Statement
Let's consider a specific dice roll simulation. Suppose you have a six-sided dice, and you want to find the number of distinct sequences of rolls that can be made with certain constraints. 

Given:
1. The number of rolls `n`.
2. An array `rollMax` where `rollMax[i]` (1-based index) is the maximum number of consecutive rolls of the `i-th` dice side that can appear.

Return the number of distinct sequences that can be made. Since the answer could be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

**Example:**

```
Input: n = 2, rollMax = [1,1,2,2,2,3]
Output: 34
Explanation: If we get [1, 1], it's invalid because rollMax[1] is 1.
              If we get [2, 2], it's invalid because rollMax[2] is 1.
              Valid sequences are e.g. [1, 2], [2, 1], [3, 1], etc.         There are 34 distinct sequences in total.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What is the maximum value for `n`?**
   - The value `n` can be up to 5000.
   
2. **Is the `rollMax` array always of length 6?**
   - Yes, it always represents the six faces of the dice.

3. **What is the range of values within `rollMax`?**
   - Each element in the `rollMax` array can range from `1` to `15`.

## Strategy
1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - We will leverage a 3D DP array `dp[i][j][k]` where `i` represents the number of rolls so far, `j` represents the face of the dice, and `k` represents the count of the same face rolled consecutively.
   - The state `dp[i][j][k]` indicates the number of ways to achieve `i` rolls where the `i-th` roll is the `j-th` dice face and it has been rolled `k` consecutive times.
   - Base case: `dp[1][j][1] = 1` for all `j` in `[0, 5]` because there's 1 way to roll any dice face once.
   - State Transition:
     - If the last roll was `j` and it was rolled `k` times, we can roll a different face `m` (for `m != j`).
     - If rolling the same face again, it needs to respect the `rollMax` constraints.
   - The result will be the sum of all valid sequences at the final roll across all faces and counts.

2. **Time Complexity:**
   - The time complexity of this approach is `O(n * 6 * max(rollMax))` since we iterate over `n` rolls, 6 faces, and potentially up to the maximum count in `rollMax`.

## Solution Code

Here's the code to implement the above approach.

```javascript
const MOD = 10**9 + 7;

var dieSimulator = function(n, rollMax) {
    const dp = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () => 
        Array.from({ length: 6 }, () => new Array(16).fill(0))
    );
    
    // Initialize base case
    for (let j = 0; j < 6; j++) {
        dp[1][j][1] = 1;
    }
    
    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < 6; j++) {
            for (let k = 1; k <= rollMax[j]; k++) {
                if (k == 1) {
                    // If we are starting a new count for face j
                    for (let m = 0; m < 6; m++) {
                        if (m != j) {
                            for (let l = 1; l <= rollMax[m]; l++) {
                                dp[i][j][1] = (dp[i][j][1] + dp[i-1][m][l]) % MOD;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                } else {
                    // If we are continuing the count for face j
                    dp[i][j][k] = dp[i-1][j][k-1];
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    let result = 0;
    for (let j = 0; j < 6; j++) {
        for (let k = 1; k <= rollMax[j]; k++) {
            result = (result + dp[n][j][k]) % MOD;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
};
```
