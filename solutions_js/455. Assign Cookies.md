[Leetcode 455. Assign Cookies](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l455)
## Problem Statement

You are assigned to distribute cookies to children. Each child has a greed factor, which is the minimum size of cookie that the child will be content with. Each cookie has a size. 
You want to maximize the number of children content with their cookie.

**Note:**
- You can assign each cookie at most one child.
- A child can be content with at most one cookie.

Given two arrays `g` and `s`:
- `g[i]` is the greed factor of the ith child.
- `s[j]` is the size of the jth cookie.

Return the maximum number of children you can make content.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are the arrays `g` and `s` guaranteed to be non-empty?
2. Can the elements of arrays `g` and `s` contain negative values or zeroes?
3. How should we handle the scenario where there are more children than cookies or vice versa?

## Strategy

To maximize the number of content children:
1. Sort both the `g` (greed factors) and `s` (cookie sizes) arrays.
2. Use a two-pointer approach to iterate through both arrays:
   - Pointer `i` for the greed factors array `g`.
   - Pointer `j` for the cookie sizes array `s`.
3. If `s[j]` (current cookie size) is greater than or equal to `g[i]` (current child's greed factor), assign the cookie to the child and move both pointers forward.
4. Otherwise, move the cookie pointer forward to find a large enough cookie for the current child.
5. Continue the process until we run out of cookies or children.

This greedy approach ensures that we are giving the smallest possible cookie that can satisfy a child, thereby maximizing the number of content children.

## Code

```javascript
function findContentChildren(g, s) {
    // Sort the greed factors and cookie sizes
    g.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    s.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    
    let i = 0; // Pointer for greed factors (children)
    let j = 0; // Pointer for cookie sizes
    
    // Iterate through both arrays
    while (i < g.length && j < s.length) {
        if (s[j] >= g[i]) {
            // If current cookie can satisfy current child
            i++; // Move to next child
        }
        // Always move to the next cookie
        j++;
    }
    
    return i; // The number of children that are content
}

// Example usage
let g = [1, 2, 3];
let s = [1, 1];
console.log(findContentChildren(g, s)); // Output: 1

g = [1, 2];
s = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(findContentChildren(g, s)); // Output: 2
```

## Time Complexity

- Sorting both arrays `g` and `s` takes \(O(n \log n)\) and \(O(m \log m)\) where \(n\) is the length of `g` and \(m\) is the length of `s`.
- The while loop iterating through both sorted arrays is \(O(n + m)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n + m \log m)\).
