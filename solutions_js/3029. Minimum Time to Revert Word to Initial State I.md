[Leetcode 3029. Minimum Time to Revert Word to Initial State I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3029)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `k` and a string `initial_str`, where `initial_str` contains `n` characters. You must perform `k` operations to transform the string while abiding by the following rules:
- In each operation, you may choose any character in the string and change it to any other character.
- If after perfoming the `k` operations the string equals the initial state of `initial_str`, return the minimum number of operations needed to revert it to its initial state.
- If it is not possible to revert the string back to its initial state after `k` operations, return -1.

**Function Signature:**
```javascript
function minOperations(k, initial_str) {
  // implementation here
}
```

Clarifying Questions:
1. What should we return if the string is already equal to the initial state at the start itself?
2. Are we guaranteed that k will always be a non-negative integer?

## Strategy

1. First, confirm if `k` is sufficient to change any string back to its original state. Observing that at each step we can revert one character back to its original, we need exactly `n` operations to revert all characters if they are changed.
2. If `k` is less than `n`, it means we do not have enough operations to revert the whole string back. Return `-1` in such cases.
3. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, we return `n` as the minimum number of operations required.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is O(1), as it involves a few condition checks and simple arithmetic operations which are constant time operations.

## Code

```javascript
function minOperations(k, initial_str) {
  let n = initial_str.length;
  
  // If we have less operations than needed to revert the string
  if (k < n) {
    return -1;
  }
  
  // We need exactly `n` operations to revert every character back
  return n;
}
```

This straightforward algorithm ensures that we return the correct number of operations needed to revert the string back to its initial state when possible or indicate that it is not possible.
