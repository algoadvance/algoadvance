[Leetcode 941. Valid Mountain Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l941)
### Problem Statement

Given an array of integers `arr`, return `true` if and only if it is a valid mountain array.

Recall that an array `arr` is a mountain array if and only if:

- `arr.length >= 3`
- There exists some `i` with `0 < i < arr.length - 1` such that:
  - `arr[0] < arr[1] < ... < arr[i - 1] < arr[i]`
  - `arr[i] > arr[i + 1] > ... > arr[arr.length - 1]`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Can the array have repeated elements?**
   - A: No, for a valid mountain array there should be strictly increasing and then strictly decreasing sequences.

2. **Q: Can the mountain have flat peaks or valleys?**
   - A: No, a valid mountain array cannot have flat peaks or valleys. Elements should strictly increase and then strictly decrease.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Check**: Check if the length of the array is at least 3. If not, return false.
2. **Find Peak**: Traverse the array and find the peak element `arr[i]` where the sequence starts decreasing.
3. **Check Strict Increase and Decrease**: 
   - Ensure the sequence strictly increases up to the peak.
   - Ensure the sequence strictly decreases after the peak.
4. **Return Result**: Validate and return true or false based on the checks.

### Code

Here's how to implement the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function validMountainArray(arr) {
    if (arr.length < 3) return false; // Minimum length check
    
    let i = 0;
    let n = arr.length;
    
    // Ascend to the peak
    while (i + 1 < n && arr[i] < arr[i + 1]) {
        i++;
    }
    
    // Peak can't be the first or the last element
    if (i == 0 || i == n - 1) return false;

    // Descend from the peak
    while (i + 1 < n && arr[i] > arr[i + 1]) {
        i++;
    }

    // If we've reached the end
    return i == n - 1;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\)
  - We are traversing the array at most twice (once for ascending, once for descending).
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(1)\)
  - Only a few variables are used, leading to constant space usage.

This completes the solution for checking if an array is a valid mountain array. If you have any further questions or need additional functionality, feel free to ask!
