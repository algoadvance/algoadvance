[Leetcode 1716. Calculate Money in Leetcode Bank](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1716)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer `n`. You have a Leetcode bank account, and you want to save money in it. The rule is as follows:

- On the 1st day, you save $1.
- On the 2nd day, you save $2.
- On the 3rd day, you save $3.
- And so on until the 7th day when you save $7.
- On the 8th day, you save $1 again, and the saving pattern repeats.

In other words, you save in a repeating sequence of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`.

Given `n`, return the total amount of money you will have saved in the Leetcode bank at the end of `n` days.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can `n` be 0 or negative?
   - No, `n` is a positive integer as implied by the problem statement.
2. Is there an upper limit to `n`?
   - The problem doesn't explicitly mention an upper limit, but in a typical coding problem, you can expect reasonable constraint checks (e.g., up to `10^6`).

### Strategy
The sequence of savings repeats every 7 days. Thus, we can break `n` into complete weeks and some extra days to compute the total savings:
1. Calculate the number of complete weeks as `weeks = Math.floor(n / 7)`.
2. Calculate the number of extra days as `extra_days = n % 7`.
3. Total savings can be computed as the sum of savings from the complete weeks plus the savings from the extra days.

For each complete week, the total savings for that week is the sum of 1 to 7, so:
\[ \text{sum\_of\_week} = 1 + 2 + \ldots + 7 = \frac{7 \cdot (7 + 1)}{2} = 28 \]

For `i` complete weeks, the savings can be computed as:
\[ \text{total\_weeks\_savings} = i \cdot 28 + 7 \cdot (i \cdot (i - 1)) / 2 \]

The extra days will just continue from the end of the last complete week, so:
\[ \text{total\_extra\_days\_savings} = (\text{starting\_value\_for\_extra\_days} + 1) + (\text{starting\_value\_for\_extra\_days} + 2) + \ldots  + (\text{starting\_value\_for\_extra\_days} + \text{extra\_days}) \]

### Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var totalMoney = function(n) {
    const weeks = Math.floor(n / 7);
    const extraDays = n % 7;

    // Sum of money saved in complete weeks
    const weeksSavings = (7 * weeks * (weeks - 1)) / 2 + 28 * weeks;
    
    // Sum of money saved in the extra days
    const extraDaysSavings = (weeks + 1) * extraDays + (extraDays * (extraDays - 1)) / 2;

    return weeksSavings + extraDaysSavings;
};

// Example usage
console.log(totalMoney(20)); // Expected output: 96
```

### Time Complexity
- The solution involves basic arithmetic operations that are constant time (O(1)).
- Therefore, the time complexity of this solution is O(1).
