[Leetcode 1253. Reconstruct a 2](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1253)
## Problem Statement

You have two arrays, `upper` and `lower`, both of length `n`, and an integer `colsum` of length `n`. We need to reconstruct a 2-row binary matrix (each row is a binary array) that meets the following conditions:

1. The sum of each column in the matrix should be equal to the corresponding value in `colsum`.
2. The sum of values in the first row should be equal to `upper`.
3. The sum of values in the second row should be equal to `lower`.

If there are multiple valid solutions, any of them will be accepted. If no valid solution exists, return an empty list.

The reconstructed matrix should look like:
```
[
 [r1c1, r1c2, ..., r1cn],
 [r2c1, r2c2, ..., r2cn]
]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. What are the constraints on the lengths of `upper`, `lower`, and `colsum`? 
   - All have the same length `n`.
2. What are the possible values for elements in `colsum`?
   - Elements in `colsum` are either 0, 1, or 2.
3. Can the sum of the matrix elements exceed the values of `upper` or `lower`?
   - No. The sum of elements in the first row must be exactly `upper`, and the sum of elements in the second row must be exactly `lower`.

## Strategy

1. Traverse through `colsum`:
   - If `colsum[i]` is 2, both matrix rows must have a 1 at column `i`.
   - If `colsum[i]` is 1, either matrix row 1 has 1 or matrix row 2 has 1.
   - If `colsum[i]` is 0, both rows must have 0 at column `i`.

2. Keep track of the remaining sums that we need to achieve for `upper` and `lower`.

3. After this traversal, we need to ensure the total sum of the first row equals `upper` and the second row equals `lower`. If not, return an empty array.

## Code

```javascript
function reconstructMatrix(upper, lower, colsum) {
    const n = colsum.length;
    const result = [new Array(n).fill(0), new Array(n).fill(0)];

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (colsum[i] === 2) {
            result[0][i] = 1;
            result[1][i] = 1;
            upper--;
            lower--;
        }
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (colsum[i] === 1) {
            if (upper > lower) {
                result[0][i] = 1;
                upper--;
            } else {
                result[1][i] = 1;
                lower--;
            }
        }
    }

    if (upper === 0 && lower === 0) {
        return result;
    }

    return [];
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this algorithm is O(n), where `n` is the length of `colsum`. We go through the array twice, once to satisfy the columns with sum 2, and again to handle the columns with sum 1. Both passes are linear operations.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n).
