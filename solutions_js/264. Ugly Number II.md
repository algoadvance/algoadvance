[Leetcode 264. Ugly Number II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l264)
## Problem Statement
An ugly number is a positive integer whose prime factors are limited to 2, 3, and 5. 

Design an algorithm to find the n-th ugly number.

### Example:
```
Input: n = 10
Output: 12
Explanation: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12] is the sequence of the first 10 ugly numbers.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Does n-indexing start at 1 or 0 in the problem statement?
   - **It starts at 1**.

2. Are there any constraints on n?
   - **Typically, it's guaranteed that 1 <= n <= 1690**.

3. Is the number 1 considered an ugly number?
   - **Yes, by convention, 1 is considered an ugly number**.

## Strategy
We can solve this problem using a dynamic programming approach:
1. Use three pointers to keep track of the next multiple of 2, 3, and 5.
2. Initialize `uglyNumbers` array with 1 because the first ugly number is 1.
3. For every next ugly number, determine the smallest value among `2 * uglyNumbers[p2], 3 * uglyNumbers[p3], 5 * uglyNumbers[p5]` and add it to the list.
4. Increment the pointer of the multiplier that produced the smallest value.
5. Repeat this process until we have generated n ugly numbers.
6. Return the n-th value in the array.

## Code
```javascript
var nthUglyNumber = function(n) {
    let uglyNumbers = new Array(n);
    uglyNumbers[0] = 1;
    
    let i2 = 0, i3 = 0, i5 = 0;
    let next2 = 2, next3 = 3, next5 = 5;
    let nextUgly;

    for(let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        nextUgly = Math.min(next2, next3, next5);
        uglyNumbers[i] = nextUgly;
        
        if (nextUgly === next2) {
            i2++;
            next2 = uglyNumbers[i2] * 2;
        }
        if (nextUgly === next3) {
            i3++;
            next3 = uglyNumbers[i3] * 3;
        }
        if (nextUgly === next5) {
            i5++;
            next5 = uglyNumbers[i5] * 5;
        }
    }
    
    return uglyNumbers[n - 1];
};

console.log(nthUglyNumber(10)); // Output: 12
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)** since we are linearly generating the first n ugly numbers. Each step involves only constant-time operations.

The space complexity is also **O(n)** as we are storing the first n ugly numbers in an array.
