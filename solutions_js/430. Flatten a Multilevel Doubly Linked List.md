[Leetcode 430. Flatten a Multilevel Doubly Linked List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l430)
## Problem Statement
You are given a doubly linked list, which in addition to the next and previous pointers, it could have a child pointer. This child pointer may or may not point to a separate doubly linked list, also containing these special nodes. These child lists may have one or more children of their own, and so on, to produce a multilevel data structure, as shown in the example below.

You are supposed to flatten the list so that all the nodes appear in a single-level, doubly linked list. You are given the head of the first level of the list.

Here is the struct for a Node:

```plaintext
class Node {
    public int val;
    public Node prev;
    public Node next;
    public Node child;
};
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Should the nodes be flattened in place, or can we create a new list?
   - The nodes should be flattened in place.
2. What should be done if the input list is empty (i.e., the head is `null`)?
   - If the input list is empty, return the head as `null`.

## Strategy
To flatten the multilevel doubly linked list, we can use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach. The idea is to traverse the list iteratively or recursively. For each node, we:
1. Process the `child` list first (if it exists), and then integrate it between the current node and the `next` node.
2. Update the `prev` and `next` pointers accordingly.

Using an iterative approach with a stack can simplify the recursion since it avoids deep recursion and makes control flow explicit.

### Detailed Steps:
1. Initialize a stack and push the head onto it.
2. Use a pointer (`current`) to traverse the list.
3. While the stack is not empty:
    - Pop the node from the stack.
    - If the popped node has a `next` node, push it onto the stack (to process later).
    - If the popped node has a `child` node:
        - Push it onto the stack.
        - Set the `child` as `current.next`, and properly update pointers.
4. Flatten the list, setting the `child` of all processed nodes to `null`.

## Code
```javascript
// Definition for a Node.
class Node {
    constructor(val, prev = null, next = null, child = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.prev = prev;
        this.next = next;
        this.child = child;
    }
}

function flatten(head) {
    if (!head) return head;

    let current = head;
    let stack = [];

    while (current != null) {
        // If the current node has a child, process it
        if (current.child != null) {
            // If `next` is not null, push it to the stack to process later
            if (current.next != null) {
                stack.push(current.next);
            }
            
            // Connect `current` with its `child`
            current.next = current.child;
            if (current.next != null) {
                current.next.prev = current;
            }

            // Clear the child pointer after integrating child list
            current.child = null;
        }

        // If `current.next` is null and the stack is not empty, use the top of the stack
        if (current.next == null && stack.length > 0) {
            let nodeFromStack = stack.pop();
            current.next = nodeFromStack;
            if (current.next != null) {
                current.next.prev = current;
            }
        }

        // Move to the next node
        current = current.next;
    }

    return head;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(n), where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because each node is processed exactly once.

### Additional Notes
- The use of the stack ensures that we preserve the order of the list and handle nested child nodes correctly.
- The solution modifies the list in place, fulfilling the requirement.

Now you should be ready to tackle variations of this problem or move on to similar linked list manipulations!
