[Leetcode 565. Array Nesting](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l565)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` of length `n` where `nums` is a permutation of the numbers in the range `[0, n - 1]`.

You should build a set `s[k] = {nums[k], nums[nums[k]], nums[nums[nums[k]]], ...}` subjected to the following rule:

- The first element in `s[k]` starts with the selection of the element `nums[k]` of `nums`.
- The next element in `s[k]` should be `nums[nums[k]]`, and so on, maintaining this pattern.
- We stop adding right before a duplicate element occurs in the set `s[k]`.

Return the longest length of set `s[k]` possible.

### Example
```
Input: nums = [5,4,0,3,1,6,2]
Output: 4
Explanation:
nums[0] = 5, nums[5] = 6, nums[6] = 2, nums[2] = 0
=> Sequence is [5, 6, 2, 0]
There are 4 elements in this sequence.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any constraints on the values within the array `nums`?**
   - The elements in `nums` are unique and integers in the range `[0, n - 1]` inclusive.
2. **Is `nums` guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - Yes, the problem guarantees `nums` is non-empty.
3. **Can we modify the input array `nums`?**
   - Yes, it is allowed to modify the array as needed.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate Over Each Index:** Start with each element in `nums` and find the length of the sequence starting with that index.
2. **Keep Track of Visited Elements:** Use a set or modify `nums` in-place to keep track of elements that have already been visited.
3. **Avoid Re-computation:** If an index has been visited during a previous sequence computation, skip it to avoid redundant work.
4. **Calculate Sequence Length:** For each starting index, follow the sequence until a visited element is encountered. Keep track of the length of this sequence.
5. **Update the Maximum Length:** Track the maximum length of any sequence found.

### Code

```javascript
function arrayNesting(nums) {
    let maxLen = 0;
    const n = nums.length;

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (nums[i] != -1) {  // -1 is used as a marker for visited elements
            let start = nums[i], count = 0;
            while (nums[start] != -1) {
                let temp = start;
                start = nums[start];
                nums[temp] = -1;  // mark as visited
                count++;
            }
            maxLen = Math.max(maxLen, count);
        }
    }
    return maxLen;
}

// Example usage:
const nums = [5,4,0,3,1,6,2];
console.log(arrayNesting(nums));  // Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input array `nums`. Each element is visited at most once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), if we ignore the space required for the input array `nums` because we are using it for marking visited elements.
