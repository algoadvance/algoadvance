[Leetcode 2899. Last Visited Integers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2899)
### Problem Statement

Design an algorithm that keeps track of a set of integers, and allows querying for the most recently visited integers in the set. Implement the following operations:

1. **visit(x)**: Add the integer `x` to the set of visited integers.
2. **last_visited(n)**: Return the last `n` unique integers that have been visited. If fewer than `n` unique integers have been visited, return all of them.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can integers be revisited, and if so, should they be considered as re-visited?
   - Yes, integers can be revisited, and when revisited, they should be considered the most recent visit.
2. What should be returned if `n` exceeds the count of unique visited integers?
   - Return all the unique visited integers.
3. Can we assume all integers fit within typical memory constraints?
   - Yes, you can assume the integers fit in memory.

With these points clarified, let's move forward with designing the solution.

### Code

```javascript
class LastVisitedIntegers {
    constructor() {
        this.order = []; // List to maintain order of visitation
        this.set = new Set(); // Set to track unique visited integers
    }

    visit(x) {
        if (this.set.has(x)) {
            // If x is already visited, remove it from the order first
            this.order.splice(this.order.indexOf(x), 1);
        }
        this.order.push(x); // Add x to the end of the order
        this.set.add(x); // Make sure x is in the set
    }

    last_visited(n) {
        // Return the last n unique elements in the order
        const result = [];
        const seen = new Set();
        for (let i = this.order.length - 1; i >= 0 && result.length < n; i--) {
            const num = this.order[i];
            if (!seen.has(num)) {
                seen.add(num);
                result.push(num);
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
}

// Example Usage:
const lvi = new LastVisitedIntegers();
lvi.visit(1);
lvi.visit(2);
lvi.visit(3);
lvi.visit(2);
console.log(lvi.last_visited(2)); // Output: [2, 3]
lvi.visit(4);
console.log(lvi.last_visited(3)); // Output: [4, 2, 3]
```

### Strategy
1. **visit(x)**:
   - If the integer `x` is already in the set, it should be removed from the current order list to update its position.
   - Add `x` to the end of the order list.
   - Ensure that `x` is in the set of visited integers.
2. **last_visited(n)**:
   - Iterate from the end of the order list and collect unique integers.
   - Stop when `n` unique integers are collected or the list is exhausted.

### Time Complexity
1. **visit(x)**:
   - Removing an element from an array (if it exists): \(O(k)\), where \(k\) is the position of the element.
   - Inserting into the end of an array: \(O(1)\).
   - Therefore, in the worst case, it takes \(O(n)\) for `visit(x)`, where \(n\) is the number of unique visited integers.

2. **last_visited(n)**:
   - We might have to traverse the entire order list, which takes \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the number of elements in the order list.
   - Collecting up to `n` unique elements: \(O(n)\).
   - Therefore, the worst-case time complexity is \(O(m)\).

### Conclusion
This implementation effectively maintains the visited integers and allows querying the most recent unique visits. The approach ensures that the most recently visited integers are tracked accurately, especially when an integer is revisited.
