[Leetcode 2971. Find Polygon With the Largest Perimeter](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2971)
## Problem Statement
You are given an array of arrays, representing a list of polygons. Each sub-array contains integers representing the length of each side of a polygon. You need to find the polygon with the largest perimeter and return the perimeter. If there are multiple polygons with the same largest perimeter, return the one that appears first in the input list.

### Example:
```javascript
Input: [[2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 1, 2], [4, 5, 6]]
Output: 15
Explanation: The third polygon has sides 4, 5, 6 with a perimeter of 15, which is the largest among the given polygons.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Will the input array always contain at least one polygon?**
   - Yes, you can assume that the input list contains at least one polygon.

2. **Are the lengths of the sides guaranteed to be positive integers?**
   - Yes, the lengths are guaranteed to be positive integers.

3. **Do we need to validate if the given sides can form a valid polygon?**
   - No, you can assume that the sides given in each sub-array can form a valid polygon.

## Strategy
1. Iterate through the list of polygons.
2. For each polygon, calculate the perimeter by summing up its side lengths.
3. Keep track of the maximum perimeter encountered and the corresponding polygon.
4. Return the largest perimeter found.

## Code
```javascript
function findPolygonWithLargestPerimeter(polygons) {
    // Initialize variables to track the maximum perimeter and its index
    let maxPerimeter = 0;
    let maxPerimeterIndex = -1;
    
    // Iterate through each polygon in the list
    for (let i = 0; i < polygons.length; i++) {
        // Calculate the perimeter of the current polygon
        let currentPerimeter = polygons[i].reduce((acc, side) => acc + side, 0);
        
        // Update maxPerimeter and maxPerimeterIndex if currentPerimeter is larger
        if (currentPerimeter > maxPerimeter) {
            maxPerimeter = currentPerimeter;
            maxPerimeterIndex = i;
        }
    }
    
    // Return the largest perimeter found
    return maxPerimeter;
}

// Example usage
const polygons = [[2, 3, 4], [1, 2, 1, 2], [4, 5, 6]];
console.log(findPolygonWithLargestPerimeter(polygons)); // Output: 15
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n \times m)\):
- \(n\) is the number of polygons.
- \(m\) is the average number of sides in each polygon.
- We iterate through each polygon and sum their sides, leading to this overall complexity.

## Conclusion
The provided implementation efficiently finds the polygon with the largest perimeter by iterating through the list of polygons and calculating their perimeters. This method guarantees that we return the largest perimeter with a clear and concise code structure.
