[Leetcode 49. Group Anagrams](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l49)
## Problem Statement:
Given an array of strings `strs`, group the anagrams together. You can return the answer in any order.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.

### Example:
```javascript
Input: strs = ["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]
Output: [["bat"],["nat","tan"],["ate","eat","tea"]]
```

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Can the input array be empty?
    - Yes, if `strs` is empty, the output should also be an empty list of lists.
2. Does the order of strings inside each group of anagrams matter in the output?
    - No, the order within each group does not matter.
3. Are all the strings lower case?
    - For simplicity, let's assume all the input strings are in lowercase.

## Strategy:
1. Create a hash map where the key is the sorted version of the string and the value is a list of strings that correspond to that key (i.e., that are anagrams of each other).
2. Iterate over each string in the input list:
    - Sort the string.
    - Use the sorted string as the key to either create a new entry in the hash map or append to an existing entry.
3. Collect all the values from the hash map, which represent the groups of anagrams.

### Step-by-step:
1. Initialize an empty hash map.
2. Traverse each string in `strs`:
   - Sort the string.
   - Use the sorted string as a key in the hash map:
     - If the key doesnâ€™t exist in the hash map, create a new list with the current string.
     - If the key exists, append the current string to the list corresponding to that key.
3. Return all the values from the hash map which will be the grouped anagrams.

## Code:
```javascript
function groupAnagrams(strs) {
    let map = new Map();

    for (let str of strs) {
        let sortedStr = str.split('').sort().join('');
        if (map.has(sortedStr)) {
            map.get(sortedStr).push(str);
        } else {
            map.set(sortedStr, [str]);
        }
    }
    
    return Array.from(map.values());
}

console.log(groupAnagrams(["eat","tea","tan","ate","nat","bat"]));
// Output: [["eat","tea","ate"],["tan","nat"],["bat"]]
```

## Time Complexity:
- Sorting each string takes `O(k log k)`, where `k` is the length of the string.
- If there are `n` strings in the input and the average length of each string is `k`, then the total time complexity would be `O(n * k log k)`.
- Inserting and retrieving from the hash map is on average `O(1)`. 

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n * k log k)`.
