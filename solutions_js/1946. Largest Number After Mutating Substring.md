[Leetcode 1946. Largest Number After Mutating Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1946)
## Problem Statement

**1946. Largest Number After Mutating Substring**

You are given a string `num` representing a large integer and an integer array `change` of length `10` where `change[i]` is the digit that the `i-th` digit (0-indexed) of the large integer `num` should be mutated to. You should apply the mutation as follows:
- Choose a substring of `num` and mutate every digit `num[i]` (0 <= i < num.length) of the substring to `change[num[i]]`.

Return the largest possible number you can get after mutating any (possibly empty) substring of `num`.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: num = "132", change = [9,8,5,0,3,6,4,2,6,8]
Output: "832"
```

### Constraints
- `1 <= num.length <= 10^5`
- `num` consists of only digits 0-9.
- `change.length == 10`
- `0 <= change[i] <= 9`

## Clarifying Questions
1. Q: Can the mutation be applied to non-consecutive digits?
   A: No, you should mutate a contiguous substring.
   
2. Q: Can the mutated substring include the entire string?
   A: Yes, it can include the entire string or any part of it.

3. Q: Can the `change` array contain the same digit for different indices?
   A: Yes, each `change[i]` can be any digit from 0 to 9.

## Strategy

The goal is to apply changes to a substring in such a way that the resulting number is the largest possible number. Here's a step-by-step strategy:

1. **Traverse** through the string `num`.
2. For each digit, check if mutating it would yield a larger digit. Start mutating if `change[num[i]] > num[i]`.
3. Continue mutating subsequent digits until a situation is encountered where `change[num[i]] < num[i]`. At this point, stop the mutation since further mutation would reduce the number.
   
This approach is greedy: we start mutating as soon as it benefits us and stop as soon as it does not.

## Code
Here's the implementation of the above strategy:

```javascript
function maximumNumber(num, change) {
    let numArray = num.split('');
    let mutated = false;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < numArray.length; i++) {
        const originalDigit = Number(numArray[i]);
        const mutatedDigit = change[originalDigit];
        
        if (mutatedDigit > originalDigit) {
            numArray[i] = mutatedDigit.toString();
            mutated = true;
        } else if (mutatedDigit < originalDigit && mutated) {
            break;
        }
    }
    
    return numArray.join('');
}

// Example usage
console.log(maximumNumber("132", [9,8,5,0,3,6,4,2,6,8])); // Output: "832"
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the string `num`. This is because we traverse the string once, making constant-time comparisons and replacements.
