[Leetcode 1536. Minimum Swaps to Arrange a Binary Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1536)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `n x n` binary grid, where each row is sorted in non-increasing order. A move consists of swapping any row with any other row. Return the minimum number of moves required to make all the 1's in each row to be below the 1's in the next row starting from the first row.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What does the binary grid represent?**
   The grid has only 1's and 0's. Rows are sorted in non-increasing order which means all 1's come before any 0's in each row.
   
2. **What does it mean for all 1's in each row to be below the 1's in the next row?**
   This means in the resulting grid, row i must have at most the same number of trailing zeroes as row i+1.

3. **Are there constraints on grid size?**
   The grid size is `n x n`.

4. **What is the maximum value for n?**
   The constraints can dictate a range, but let's work with typical sizes for simplicity and scalability to larger datasets.

### Strategy

1. **Determine the Trailing Zeroes:**
   For each row, calculate the number of trailing zeroes as we will use this information to decide the order of the rows.

2. **Sorting Rows:**
   To manage this efficiently, rows with more trailing zeroes should precede rows with fewer trailing zeroes. 

3. **Count Swaps:**
   For each row if it doesn't meet the condition, find another row that can be swapped to satisfy the condition and increment the swap counter.

### Code

```javascript
function minSwaps(grid) {
    const n = grid.length;
    const trailingZeroes = Array(n).fill(0);
    
    // Calculate trailing zeroes for each row
    for (let i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        let count = 0;
        for (let j = n - 1; j >= 0; --j) {
            if (grid[i][j] === 0) count++;
            else break;
        }
        trailingZeroes[i] = count;
    }

    let swaps = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (trailingZeroes[i] >= n - 1 - i) continue; // Already satisfies the condition

        // Find a row to swap with
        let swapRow = i;
        while (swapRow < n && trailingZeroes[swapRow] < n - 1 - i) {
            swapRow++;
        }

        // If no such row found
        if (swapRow === n) return -1;

        // Bring the row with enough trailing zeroes up
        while (swapRow > i) {
            const temp = trailingZeroes[swapRow];
            trailingZeroes[swapRow] = trailingZeroes[swapRow - 1];
            trailingZeroes[swapRow - 1] = temp;
            swapRow--;
            swaps++;
        }
    }

    return swaps;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Calculating trailing zeroes:** `O(n^2)` (since we are checking each element of the grid)
- **Swapping rows:** Roughly linear in terms of n due to the nested while loops

Thus, the overall time complexity of the solution is **O(n^2)**.

This solution effectively calculates the necessary swaps to ensure each row conforms to the required order based on trailing zeroes and efficiently counts the number of such operations.
