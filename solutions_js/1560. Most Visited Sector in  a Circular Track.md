[Leetcode 1560. Most Visited Sector in  a Circular Track](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1560)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n` and an integer array `rounds`. The track has `n` sectors labeled from `1` to `n`. The rounds array represents the sectors that the marathon runner visited in order. The marathon runner starts at the sector `rounds[0]` and moves in a clockwise direction.

Return an array of the most visited sectors sorted in ascending order.

#### Example:
- **Input:**
  - `n = 4`
  - `rounds = [1,3,1,2]`
- **Output:**
  - `[1,2]`

Explanation: The marathon runner starts at sector 1. The path is as follows:
- 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 1 -> 2

Sectors 1 and 2 are the most visited.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can we assume that the input array `rounds` is non-empty and contains at least one element?
2. Are sector labels always continuous from 1 through n?
3. Is the runner's movement strictly clockwise, and does it wrap around the sector numbers?

### Code
```javascript
function mostVisited(n, rounds) {
    let result = [];
    let start = rounds[0];
    let end = rounds[rounds.length - 1];
    
    // If start is lesser or equal to end, the most visited sectors will be from start to end inclusive.
    if (start <= end) {
        for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {
            result.push(i);
        }
    } else {
        // If end is lesser than start, it means we have wrapped around.
        for (let i = 1; i <= end; i++) {
            result.push(i);
        }
        for (let i = start; i <= n; i++) {
            result.push(i);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Strategy
1. **Identify Start and End Points:** The runnerâ€™s first starting sector is `rounds[0]`, and the final sector they land on is `rounds[rounds.length - 1]`.
2. **Direct Path or Wrap Around:**
   - If the starting sector is less than or equal to the ending sector, it means all the most visited sectors are within the range `[start, end]`.
   - If the starting sector is greater than the ending sector, it means the runner has wrapped around the track. Hence, the sectors within the ranges `[1, end]` and `[start, n]` would be the most visited.
   
3. **Construct the Result:** Populate the result in ascending order based on the identified sectors.

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach is `O(n)` in the worst case, where the number of sectors visited has to be iterated twice due to the wrap-around. However, typically it will be `O(n/2)` on average since only part of the sectors needs to be enumerated.

### Testing the Solution
```javascript
// Test Cases
console.log(mostVisited(4, [1,3,1,2]));  // Should return [1, 2]
console.log(mostVisited(7, [1,3,5,7]));  // Should return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
console.log(mostVisited(3, [2,2,2,2,3]));  // Should return [2, 3]
console.log(mostVisited(10, [5,8,3,7]));  // Should return [1, 2, 3, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]
```
This code should cover several scenarios, ensuring the solution works correctly for both direct and wrap-around paths.
