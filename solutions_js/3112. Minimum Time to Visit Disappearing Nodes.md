[Leetcode 3112. Minimum Time to Visit Disappearing Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3112)
## Problem Statement:

You are given an integer array `routes`, where `routes[i]` is the distance of the ith node from the starting point. The nodes disappear one by one in every unit of time starting from the left. You need to find the minimum time to visit the disappearing nodes in the given order.

For instance, if you have routes = [2, 3, 6, 8], you need to start at 0 and visit the nodes in the same order they disappear. If you reach node 2 at time 2, node 3 at time 3, and so on, you can still visit the nodes if the time matches their disappearing time exactly.

## Clarifying Questions:

1. What is the structure of the input and output?
   - **Input**: An array of integers representing the distances of nodes from the start.
   - **Output**: An integer representing the minimum time to visit those nodes before they disappear.

2. Are the distances in `routes` sorted? 
   - We can assume they are not necessarily sorted.

3. What should be done if the nodes cannot be visited in order?
   - If it's impossible to visit all nodes in order, the output should be the minimum time to visit the maximum number of nodes in that order.

## Strategy:

1. **Sorting the Routes**: First, sort the routes by distance because you need to visit nodes in the order they disappear.
2. **Visitation Simulation**: Start at time 0. For each node, check if you can reach it before or when it disappears based on the current time.
3. **Time Tracking**: Keep track of the time increment with each visit. 

## Code:

```javascript
function minTimeToVisitNodes(routes) {
    // Sort the routes by distance.
    routes.sort((a, b) => a - b);
  
    let currentTime = 0;  // Initialize the current time to zero.
  
    for (let i = 0; i < routes.length; i++) {
        if (currentTime < routes[i]) {
            // If the current time is less than the distance of the node, update the current time.
            currentTime = routes[i];
        } else if (currentTime > routes[i]) {
            // If the current time is greater than the distance of the node, increment the current time by 1 per node visit.
            currentTime++;
        }
    }
  
    // The currentTime now represents the minimum time to visit all nodes.
    return currentTime;
}

// Example usage
console.log(minTimeToVisitNodes([2, 3, 6, 8]));  // Output: Based on the example, the result should be computed as 8.
```

## Time Complexity:

- **Sorting**: O(n log n), where n is the number of nodes/distances.
- **Traversal**: O(n) to iterate through the sorted list of distances.

The overall time complexity is dominated by the sorting step, which is O(n log n).

## Explanation:

1. **Sorting**: By sorting the `routes`, you ensure that you are always considering the earliest disappearing node first.
2. **Iterate and Increment**: Start from time 0 and increment your time each moment you visit a node. If you can't reach the next node in time, increment appropriately.

This approach ensures you visit nodes in the correct order and find the minimum time required to visit all disappearing nodes.
