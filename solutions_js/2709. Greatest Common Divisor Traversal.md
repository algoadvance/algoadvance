[Leetcode 2709. Greatest Common Divisor Traversal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2709)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`, and for each integer `i` in the range `1 <= i < nums.length`, we must determine if there exists a path from `nums[0]` to `nums[i]` such that the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the adjacent nodes in this path is greater than 1. A path means an ordered sequence of distinct indices where adjacent indices share this gcd property. If such a path exists, we record the index `i` in a result array.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: nums = [3, 6, 9, 12, 15]
Output: [1, 2, 3, 4]

Input: nums = [1, 2, 3]
Output: []
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Edge cases**: What should be returned if the `nums` array has only one element or no element at all?
   - If `nums` has only one element or is empty, the output should be an empty array.

2. **Path properties**: Should the path be the minimum length, or can it be any length as long as the gcd condition is satisfied?
   - The path can be of any length as long as it meets the gcd condition.

3. **Result uniqueness**: Should indices be unique and in sorted order in the result array?
   - Yes, the indices should be unique and in ascending order.

### Strategy

1. **Graph Representation**:
   - Represent the problem as a graph where each node is an index in `nums`, and an edge exists between nodes `i` and `j` if `gcd(nums[i], nums[j]) > 1`.

2. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**:
   - Use BFS from node `0` to find all reachable nodes.
   - Use an adjacency list to maintain connections.

3. **Use GCD Utility**:
   - Use a helper function to calculate the gcd of two numbers.

4. **Graph Construction**:
   - Iterate through the array and build the graph based on the gcd condition.

### Implementation

Hereâ€™s how the implementation can be structured:

1. Use the gcd utility to determine connections.
2. Construct the adjacency list for the graph.
3. Perform BFS starting from node 0 to find all reachable nodes.
4. Collect the results.

```javascript
const gcd = (a, b) => {
  while (b) {
    [a, b] = [b, a % b];
  }
  return a;
};

const indicesWithGCDPath = (nums) => {
  const n = nums.length;
  if (n <= 1) return [];

  // Step 1: Build the adjacency list
  const adj = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
  
  for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
    for (let j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
      if (gcd(nums[i], nums[j]) > 1) {
        adj[i].push(j);
        adj[j].push(i);
      }
    }
  }

  // Step 2: BFS to find all reachable nodes from index 0
  const visited = new Array(n).fill(false);
  const queue = [0];
  visited[0] = true;

  while (queue.length > 0) {
    const node = queue.shift();

    for (const neighbor of adj[node]) {
      if (!visited[neighbor]) {
        visited[neighbor] = true;
        queue.push(neighbor);
      }
    }
  }

  // Collect the reachable indices
  const result = [];
  for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
    if (visited[i]) {
      result.push(i);
    }
  }

  return result;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(indicesWithGCDPath([3, 6, 9, 12, 15])); // [1, 2, 3, 4]
console.log(indicesWithGCDPath([1, 2, 3])); // []
```

### Time Complexity

- **Building the Adjacency List**: O(N^2 * log(min(A, B))) where `N` is the length of `nums` and `A` and `B` are elements of `nums` (due to the gcd calculation between each pair).
- **BFS Traversal**: O(V + E) where `V` is the number of vertices (N) and `E` is the number of edges.
- **Overall Complexity**: O(N^2 * log(min(A, B))) dominated by the adjacency list construction.
