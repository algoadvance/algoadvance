[Leetcode 807. Max Increase to Keep City Skyline](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l807)
## Problem Statement

You are given two 2D arrays, `grid1` and `grid2` of size `n x n` representing the height of buildings in a city. We should increase the height of buildings to keep the City's sky line unchanged as per the following rules:

1. The "skyline" of the city should be the same when viewed from the top/bottom and left/right.
2. The building height can be increased but not decreased.

In this problem, you are asked to return the maximum total sum that the building heights can be increased by without changing the city's skyline from the top/bottom and left/right.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the dimensions of `grid1` and `grid2` guaranteed to be the same?
   - Yes, both grids have the same dimensions.
   
2. Can the heights of the buildings be zero or negative?
   - In typical scenarios, building heights would be positive integers, but it's good to clarify. For this problem, assume heights are non-negative integers.

3. Is it allowed to modify the input grids?
   - Usually, we can assume that we shouldnâ€™t modify the input unless explicitly allowed. We will work on a separate data structure in this case.

## Strategy

1. First, we need to determine and store the maximum heights for each row and each column from `grid1` to establish the skyline.
2. Iterate through each cell in `grid2` and determine the maximum height it can be increased to without affecting the skyline.
3. Calculate the difference between the current height and the computed maximum height to get the total sum of the increase.

## Code

```javascript
function maxIncreaseKeepingSkyline(grid) {
    const n = grid.length;
    const rowMaxes = new Array(n).fill(0);
    const colMaxes = new Array(n).fill(0);
    
    // Determine row and column maximum heights
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            rowMaxes[i] = Math.max(rowMaxes[i], grid[i][j]);
            colMaxes[j] = Math.max(colMaxes[j], grid[i][j]);
        }
    }
    
    // Calculate the total sum of the possible increases
    let totalIncrease = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            const maxIncreaseHeight = Math.min(rowMaxes[i], colMaxes[j]);
            totalIncrease += maxIncreaseHeight - grid[i][j];
        }
    }
    
    return totalIncrease;
}

// Example usage:
const grid = [
    [3, 0, 8, 4],
    [2, 4, 5, 7],
    [9, 2, 6, 3],
    [0, 3, 1, 0]
];

console.log(maxIncreaseKeepingSkyline(grid)); // Output: 35
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n^2)\) because:
1. We iterate through each cell twice:
   - Once to determine the maximum heights for rows and columns.
   - Once to calculate the total possible increase.
   
Since `n` is the length of one dimension of the grid and we have two nested loops iterating over the `n x n` grid, the time complexity is \(O(n^2)\).

The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the additional arrays (`rowMaxes` and `colMaxes`) used to store the maximum values for each row and column.
