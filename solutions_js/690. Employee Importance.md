[Leetcode 690. Employee Importance](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l690)
Sure, let's work through the problem step-by-step.

### Problem Statement

You have a data structure of employee information, which includes the unique ID of each employee, their importance value, and their direct subordinates' IDs.

You are given the information of a company, which is represented by a list of `employees` where each element is of class `Employee`. An `Employee` has the following attributes:
- `int id`
- `int importance`
- `List<Integer> subordinates`

You need to implement a function to return the total importance value of an employee and all their subordinates based on the employee ID.

### Example
```javascript
class Employee {
    constructor(id, importance, subordinates) {
        this.id = id;
        this.importance = importance;
        this.subordinates = subordinates;
    }
}
```

**Example Input:**
```javascript
employees = [
    new Employee(1, 5, [2, 3]),
    new Employee(2, 3, []),
    new Employee(3, 3, [])
]
id = 1
```

**Example Output:**
`11`

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can there be a circular reference in the subordinates list?
   - No, the problem specifies there will be no circular references.
2. Are all IDs unique?
   - Yes, each employee has a unique ID.

### Strategy
1. **Convert List to Map**: First, convert the list of employees into a hashmap (or dictionary) for quick access based on employee IDs.
2. **Depth-First Search (DFS)**: Use DFS to traverse the tree of subordinates, accumulating importance values as we go.

### Code
Here's the implementation of the described strategy:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {Employee[]} employees
 * @param {number} id
 * @return {number}
 */
var GetImportance = function(employees, id) {
    // Convert the list into a map for quick access
    let employeeMap = new Map();
    for (let employee of employees) {
        employeeMap.set(employee.id, employee);
    }
    
    // DFS function to calculate the importance sum
    function dfs(empId) {
        let employee = employeeMap.get(empId);
        let totalImportance = employee.importance;
        
        for (let subId of employee.subordinates) {
            totalImportance += dfs(subId);
        }
        
        return totalImportance;
    }
    
    // Start DFS from the given ID
    return dfs(id);
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of employees. In the worst case, we will visit each employee once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(N), for the recursion stack and the hashmap storing employee details.

This solution efficiently computes the total importance using depth-first search along with a hash map for quick look-up, providing a clear and concise path to the solution.
