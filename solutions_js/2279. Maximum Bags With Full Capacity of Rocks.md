[Leetcode 2279. Maximum Bags With Full Capacity of Rocks](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2279)
### Problem Statement
Given `n` bags, each with a certain capacity and number of rocks already in it, we also have `additionalRocks` which can be distributed among the bags. Our goal is to find the maximum number of bags that can be filled to their full capacity using these additional rocks.

#### Input:
- `capacity` (array of integers): This represents the capacity of each bag.
- `rocks` (array of integers): This represents the current number of rocks in each bag.
- `additionalRocks` (integer): The number of additional rocks we can distribute.

#### Output:
- Return the maximum number of bags that can be filled to full capacity.

### Clarifying Questions
Before proceeding, we should consider a few questions to clarify any ambiguities:
1. Can the initial rock count in a bag exceed its capacity?
2. Are the capacities and rocks in the `capacity` and `rocks` arrays in the same order, i.e., `capacity[i]` corresponds to `rocks[i]`?
3. Can the value of `additionalRocks` be negative?

Based on typical problem settings:
1. No, the initial rock count should not exceed the bag's capacity.
2. Yes, `capacity[i]` corresponds to `rocks[i]`.
3. No, `additionalRocks` will be non-negative.

### Strategy
1. Calculate the difference for each bag between its capacity and the current number of rocks (i.e., `capacity[i] - rocks[i]`).
2. Sort these differences in ascending order.
3. Iterate through the sorted differences and distribute the additional rocks until you run out or until a bag can no longer be filled.

### Code
Here's the JavaScript solution implementing the above strategy:

```javascript
var maximumBags = function(capacity, rocks, additionalRocks) {
    let n = capacity.length;
    let diffs = new Array(n);

    // Calculate the difference needed for each bag to be full
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        diffs[i] = capacity[i] - rocks[i];
    }

    // Sort the differences in ascending order
    diffs.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    let filledBags = 0;

    // Distribute additional rocks
    for (let i = 0; i < n && additionalRocks > 0; i++) {
        if (diffs[i] <= additionalRocks) {
            additionalRocks -= diffs[i];
            filledBags++;
        } else {
            // No more rocks to fill this bag
            break;
        }
    }

    return filledBags;
};
```

### Time Complexity
1. **Calculating Differences:** This takes O(n), where n is the number of bags.
2. **Sorting Differences:** Sorting the differences takes O(n log n).
3. **Filling Bags:** This iteration takes O(n).

Overall, the time complexity is **O(n log n)** due to the sorting step, which is the most time-consuming part of the algorithm.
