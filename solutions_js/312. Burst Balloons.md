[Leetcode 312. Burst Balloons](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l312)
### Problem Statement
You are given `n` balloons, indexed from `0` to `n-1`. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by an array `nums`. You are asked to burst all the balloons. If you burst the `i-th` balloon, you will get `nums[i-1] * nums[i] * nums[i+1]` coins. Here the edge case `nums[-1] = nums[n] = 1` is taken into account if `i - 1` or `i + 1` goes out of the bounds of the array.

You need to find the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Will the number of balloons (`n`) always be greater than or equal to 1?**
   - Yes.
2. **Can the numbers on the balloons be negative?**
   - No, the numbers on balloons are non-negative integers.
3. **Is there a maximum size for the input array `nums`?**
   - It is typically constrained by the problem description on LeetCode (usually up to 500 balloons).

### Strategy
1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
    - We can use a dynamic programming (DP) table to keep track of the maximum coins we can collect by bursting balloons in a certain range.
    - Let's define `dp[left][right]` to be the maximum coins we can collect by bursting all the balloons between `left` and `right` (exclusive).
    - We need to iterate through all possible ranges and for each range calculate the maximum coins by considering bursting each balloon as the last one in that range.
2. **Base Case**:
    - When the range `(left, right)` is adjacent, there are no balloons to burst between `left` and `right`, so the value is `0`.
3. **Transition**:
    - For a range `(left, right)`, if we consider `k` as the last balloon to burst, then the coins obtained is `nums[left]*nums[k]*nums[right] + dp[left][k] + dp[k][right]`.
    - We iterate over all possible values of `k` between `left+1` and `right-1` and take the maximum.

Below is the implementation of this approach in JavaScript:

### Code
```javascript
var maxCoins = function(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    // Add virtual balloons with value `1` at both ends
    nums = [1, ...nums, 1];
    
    // Create a DP array
    const dp = Array.from({ length: n + 2 }, () => Array(n + 2).fill(0));

    // Fill DP array
    for (let length = 1; length <= n; length++) {
        for (let left = 1; left <= n - length + 1; left++) {
            const right = left + length - 1;

            // Initialize dp[left][right]
            for (let i = left; i <= right; i++) {
                dp[left][right] = Math.max(
                    dp[left][right],
                    nums[left - 1] * nums[i] * nums[right + 1] + dp[left][i - 1] + dp[i + 1][right]
                );
            }
        }
    }

    // The result is in dp[1][n]
    return dp[1][n];
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^3), where n is the number of balloons. We have three nested loops: the outermost loop iterates over all possible lengths, the second loop iterates over all possible left boundaries, and the innermost loop iterates over all possible choices of the last balloon to burst.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n^2) due to the DP table used to store the results for subproblems.
