[Leetcode 673. Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l673)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return the number of longest increasing subsequences (LIS).

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, `[3,6,2,7]` is a subsequence of the array `[0,3,1,6,2,2,7]`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for the integers in `nums`?**
   - The values can be negative, zero, or positive integers.

2. **What is the size of the input array?**
   - The input array size will be `1 <= nums.length <= 2000`.

3. **Is there a time or space complexity requirement we need to keep in mind?**
   - While there is no explicit requirement mentioned, we should aim for an efficient solution.

4. **Can there be duplicate numbers in the input array?**
   - Yes, duplicates are allowed in the input array.

## Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
   - Use dynamic programming to store the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at each element.
   - Maintain a separate array to count the number of such sequences.

2. **Initialization**:
   - `lengths[i]` will keep track of the length of the longest increasing subsequence ending at index `i`.
   - `counts[i]` will keep track of the number of longest increasing subsequences ending at index `i`.

3. **Iteration through the array**:
   - For each element `nums[i]`, check all previous elements `nums[j]` where `j < i`.
   - If `nums[i] > nums[j]`, it means `nums[i]` can be appended to the subsequence ending at `j`. Update `lengths[i]` and `counts[i]` accordingly.

4. **Finding the Result**:
   - Find the maximum length of the LIS from the `lengths` array.
   - Sum up the counts of the sequences that have this maximum length.

## Code

```javascript
var findNumberOfLIS = function(nums) {
    if (nums.length === 0) return 0;

    const n = nums.length;
    const lengths = Array(n).fill(1);
    const counts = Array(n).fill(1);

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                if (lengths[i] < lengths[j] + 1) {
                    lengths[i] = lengths[j] + 1;
                    counts[i] = counts[j];
                } else if (lengths[i] === lengths[j] + 1) {
                    counts[i] += counts[j];
                }
            }
        }
    }

    const maxLength = Math.max(...lengths);
    let result = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (lengths[i] === maxLength) {
            result += counts[i];
        }
    }

    return result;
};
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of the provided solution is **O(n^2)**, where `n` is the length of the input array. This is due to the nested loop where for each element `i`, we are iterating through all previous elements `j`.

- The space complexity is **O(n)**, as we are using additional arrays `lengths` and `counts` to store intermediate results.

This solution should perform well given the constraints of the problem (with `nums.length` up to 2000).
