[Leetcode 673. Number of Longest Increasing Subsequence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l673)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums`, and you need to return the number of longest increasing subsequences (LIS) in the array.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. A subsequence `[nums[i1], nums[i2], ..., nums[ik]]` is increasing if `i1 < i2 < ... < ik` and `nums[i1] < nums[i2] < ... < nums[ik]`.

### Example
1. Input: `nums = [1,3,5,4,7]`
   Output: `2`
   Explanation: The two longest increasing subsequences are `[1, 3, 4, 7]` and `[1, 3, 5, 7]`.

2. Input: `nums = [2, 2, 2, 2, 2]`
   Output: `5`
   Explanation: The length of the longest increasing subsequence is `1`, and there are `5` subsequences of length `1`, which are the 5 single elements.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are the integers in `nums` always positive? 
2. Can `nums` be an empty array? If so, should we return `0`?
3. What are the expected constraints (e.g., size of `nums`)?
   
## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use Dynamic Programming (DP). We will maintain two arrays:
1. `lengths`: `lengths[i]` will store the length of the longest increasing subsequence that ends with `nums[i]`.
2. `counts`: `counts[i]` will store the number of longest increasing subsequences that end with `nums[i]`.

### Steps:
1. Initialize the `lengths` and `counts` arrays, both of the same length as `nums`, with all elements set to 1. By default, each element is its own subsequence of length 1.
2. Iterate through the array using two nested loops to update `lengths` and `counts` based on comparisons between elements.
3. Check if extending the sequence ending at `nums[j]` with `nums[i]` results in a longer subsequence, update `lengths[i]` and `counts[i]` accordingly.
4. Finally, find the maximum length from the `lengths` array, and sum up the corresponding counts.

## Code

```javascript
function findNumberOfLIS(nums) {
    if (nums.length === 0) {
        return 0;
    }

    const n = nums.length;
    const lengths = Array(n).fill(1); // Lengths of the LIS ending at each element
    const counts = Array(n).fill(1);   // Counts of the LIS ending at each element

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (nums[i] > nums[j]) {
                if (lengths[j] + 1 > lengths[i]) {
                    lengths[i] = lengths[j] + 1;
                    counts[i] = counts[j];
                } else if (lengths[j] + 1 === lengths[i]) {
                    counts[i] += counts[j];
                }
            }
        }
    }

    const maxLength = Math.max(...lengths);
    let result = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (lengths[i] === maxLength) {
            result += counts[i];
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n^2) because of the nested loops where each element is compared with every other element.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) because we are using two arrays of size `n`.

This approach effectively uses dynamic programming to address the problem of finding the number of longest increasing subsequences.
