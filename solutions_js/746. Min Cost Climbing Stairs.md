[Leetcode 746. Min Cost Climbing Stairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l746)
### Problem Statement:

You are given an integer array `cost` where `cost[i]` is the cost of `i-th` step on a staircase. Once you pay the cost, you can either climb one or two steps.

You can either start from the step with index `0`, or the step with index `1`.

Return the minimum cost to reach the top of the floor.

Example 1:
```
Input: cost = [10, 15, 20]
Output: 15
Explanation: Cheapest is start on cost[1], pay that cost, and go to the top.
```

Example 2:
```
Input: cost = [1, 100, 1, 1, 1, 100, 1, 1, 100, 1]
Output: 6
Explanation: Cheapest is start on cost[0], and only step on 1s, skipping cost[3].
```

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q:** Can we assume that the input array `cost` will always have at least 2 elements?  
   **A:** Yes, as per the problem description, you can either start from index `0` or index `1`, implying at least 2 steps.

2. **Q:** What should the output be if the `cost` is an empty array?  
   **A:** Given the constraint that the array will have at least 2 elements, this case need not be handled.

3. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the values within the `cost` array (e.g., are they all positive integers)?  
   **A:** The problem does not specify negative costs, so we can assume all costs are non-negative integers.

### Code:

```javascript
var minCostClimbingStairs = function(cost) {
    const n = cost.length;
    let dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);  // Create a DP array
    
    // Initialize the base cases
    dp[0] = 0;
    dp[1] = 0;
    
    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i - 1] + cost[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + cost[i - 2]);
    }
    
    return dp[n];
};
```

### Strategy:

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - Define `dp[i]` as the minimal cost to reach the `i-th` step.
   - To reach step `i`, you can either come from step `i-1` or `i-2`.
   - Hence, the recurrence relation is:
     - `dp[i] = min(dp[i - 1] + cost[i - 1], dp[i - 2] + cost[i - 2])`
   - Start by initializing `dp[0]` and `dp[1]` to 0 since you can start from either step with no initial cost.
   - Iterate from 2 to `n` to fill the `dp` array.
   - The answer will be in `dp[n]` as it represents the minimum cost to reach the top which is beyond the last step (`n` steps from the ground).

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the given `cost` array. This is because we iterate through the `cost` array once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(n)` due to the extra space used by the `dp` array of size `n + 1`. 

This approach ensures an efficient solution both in terms of time and space, providing a clear, step-by-step method to reach the top of the staircase with minimal cost.
