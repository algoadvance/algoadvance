[Leetcode 1779. Find Nearest Point That Has the Same X or Y Coordinate](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1779)
## Problem Statement

You're given two integers, `x` and `y`, which represent your current location on a Cartesian coordinate grid. You are also given an array, `points`, where each `points[i] = [ai, bi]` represents that a point exists at the coordinate `(ai, bi)`. 

A point is valid if it shares the same x-coordinate or the same y-coordinate as your location. Return the index (0-based) of the valid point with the smallest Manhattan distance from your current location. If there are multiple valid points with the same smallest Manhattan distance, return the smallest index. If there are no valid points, return -1.

The Manhattan distance between two points `(x1, y1)` and `(x2, y2)` is `|x1 - x2| + |y1 - y2|`.

### Constraints:
- `1 <= points.length <= 10^4`
- `points[i].length == 2`
- `1 <= x, y, ai, bi <= 10^4`

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Clarify Output**: Should we always return the smallest index when multiple points have the same Manhattan distance?
   - Yes, the problem statement specifies returning the smallest index in case of a tie.
   
2. **Cases with No Valid Points**: If no points share the same x or y coordinate with the given `(x, y)`, should we return `-1`?
   - Yes, return `-1` if no valid points exist.

3. **Constraints on Coordinates**: Are all coordinates guaranteed to be positive integers as per the constraints?
   - Yes, all coordinates `x, y, ai, bi` are between 1 and 10,000.

## Strategy

1. Initialize a variable to keep track of the smallest Manhattan distance found (`minDistance`) and its corresponding index (`minIndex`).
2. Iterate over each given point to check if it shares the same x or y coordinate with `(x, y)`.
3. For each valid point, calculate the Manhattan distance.
4. If the calculated distance is smaller than `minDistance`, update both `minDistance` and `minIndex`.
5. If the distance equals `minDistance` but the index is smaller, update `minIndex` accordingly.
6. Return the index of the nearest valid point with the smallest Manhattan distance. If no valid point is found, return `-1`.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} x
 * @param {number} y
 * @param {number[][]} points
 * @return {number}
 */
function nearestValidPoint(x, y, points) {
    let minDistance = Infinity;
    let minIndex = -1;

    for (let i = 0; i < points.length; i++) {
        const [px, py] = points[i];
        
        if (px === x || py === y) {
            const distance = Math.abs(px - x) + Math.abs(py - y);
            
            if (distance < minDistance) {
                minDistance = distance;
                minIndex = i;
            }
        }
    }

    return minIndex;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of points in the `points` array. We iterate through each point exactly once.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`, aside from the input and output, we're using a constant amount of extra space for our variables `minDistance` and `minIndex`.
