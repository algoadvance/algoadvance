[Leetcode 2409. Count Days Spent Together](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2409)
### Problem Statement

Given four strings `arriveAlice`, `leaveAlice`, `arriveBob`, and `leaveBob` representing the arrival and departure dates of Alice and Bob respectively, formated as "MM-DD", return the total number of days that Alice and Bob spend together during their stay at the same place.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Date Validity**: Should we assume that all given dates are valid and follow the "MM-DD" format, and Alice's and Bob's arrival dates are less than or equal to their departure dates?
   - Yes, you can assume all inputs are valid and the dates are well-formed.

2. **Year Consistency**: Are all dates considered within the same year?
   - Yes, all dates are within the same year.

3. **Bounds**: What are the constraints of the problem?
   - The constraints are not explicitly provided, but we can safely assume it fits within typical competitive programming limits.

### Strategy

1. **Convert Dates to Day-of-Year**: First, convert the given MM-DD format into day-of-year (1 to 365). This will make comparison easier.
2. **Calculate Overlap**: Determine the overlapping dates between Alice and Bob's stays.
3. **Count Overlap**: Count the days in the overlap range.

To simplify:
- Start from the later arrival date.
- End at the earlier departure date.
- If the start date is after the end date, there's no overlap.

### Code

Here is the code to implement the above strategy:

```javascript
function countDaysTogether(arriveAlice, leaveAlice, arriveBob, leaveBob) {
    const daysInMonth = [31, 28, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31, 31, 30, 31, 30, 31];

    function dateToDayOfYear(date) {
        const [month, day] = date.split('-');
        const monthIdx = parseInt(month) - 1;
        const dayIdx = parseInt(day);
        let dayOfYear = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < monthIdx; i++) {
            dayOfYear += daysInMonth[i];
        }
        dayOfYear += dayIdx;
        return dayOfYear;
    }

    const arriveAliceDay = dateToDayOfYear(arriveAlice);
    const leaveAliceDay = dateToDayOfYear(leaveAlice);
    const arriveBobDay = dateToDayOfYear(arriveBob);
    const leaveBobDay = dateToDayOfYear(leaveBob);

    const overlapStart = Math.max(arriveAliceDay, arriveBobDay);
    const overlapEnd = Math.min(leaveAliceDay, leaveBobDay);

    if (overlapStart > overlapEnd) {
        return 0;
    }

    return overlapEnd - overlapStart + 1;
}

// Example test case
console.log(countDaysTogether("08-15", "08-18", "08-16", "08-19")); // Output: 3
console.log(countDaysTogether("10-01", "10-31", "11-01", "12-31")); // Output: 0
```

### Time Complexity

- **Date Conversion**: The conversion from MM-DD to day-of-year involves iterating over a constant number of elements (at most 12 for the months), so it can be considered O(1) for each date.
- **Overall Complexity**: The overall complexity of the function is O(1), as it does a constant amount of work regardless of input size.

This solution efficiently computes the overlapping days that Alice and Bob spend together using a straightforward and performant approach.
