[Leetcode 1276. Number of Burgers with No Waste of Ingredients](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1276)
### Problem Statement
Given two integers `tomatoSlices` and `cheeseSlices`, we need to find how many jumbo burgers and how many small burgers can be made. 

- Jumbo burgers require 4 tomato slices and 1 cheese slice.
- Small burgers require 2 tomato slices and 1 cheese slice.

Return `[number_of_jumbo_burgers, number_of_small_burgers]`. If it is not possible to make the exact amount, return `[]`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Range**:
   - What is the range of values for `tomatoSlices` and `cheeseSlices`?
   - **Response**: Both `tomatoSlices` and `cheeseSlices` are non-negative integers, and their maximum value can be up to \(10^7\).

2. **Output Format**:
   - Should the output always be an array? 
   - **Response**: Yes, either return the array `[number_of_jumbo_burgers, number_of_small_burgers]` or an empty array `[]` if it's not possible to make the exact amount with the given ingredients.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we should start by defining variables:
- Let `j` be the number of jumbo burgers.
- Let `s` be the number of small burgers.

From the problem's constraints, we can derive two equations:
1. `4j + 2s = tomatoSlices` (since each jumbo burger uses 4 tomato slices and each small burger uses 2 tomato slices)
2. `j + s = cheeseSlices` (since each type of burger uses 1 cheese slice)

We need to solve these equations to find `j` and `s`.

By substituting the `j` from the second equation into the first equation, we get:
\[ j = cheeseSlices - s \]

Substitute `j` into the first equation:
\[ 4(cheeseSlices - s) + 2s = tomatoSlices \]
\[ 4 \cdot cheeseSlices - 4s + 2s = tomatoSlices \]
\[ 4 \cdot cheeseSlices - 2s = tomatoSlices \]
\[ 2s = 4 \cdot cheeseSlices - tomatoSlices \]
\[ s = \frac{4 \cdot cheeseSlices - tomatoSlices}{2} \]

Thus, we can calculate `s` if \((4 \cdot cheeseSlices - tomatoSlices)\) is non-negative and even.

Finally, the number of jumbo burgers \(j\) will be \( cheeseSlices - s \).

### Code
```javascript
function numOfBurgers(tomatoSlices, cheeseSlices) {
    // Calculate the number of small burgers
    const s = (4 * cheeseSlices - tomatoSlices) / 2;
    
    // Check if the computed number of small burgers is valid (non-negative and an integer)
    if (s < 0 || s !== Math.floor(s)) {
        return [];
    }
    
    // Calculate the number of jumbo burgers
    const j = cheeseSlices - s;
    
    // Ensure that the number of jumbo burgers is non-negative
    if (j < 0) {
        return [];
    }

    // Return the result as an array
    return [j, s];
}

// Example usage:
console.log(numOfBurgers(16, 7));  // Output: [1, 6]
console.log(numOfBurgers(17, 4));  // Output: []
console.log(numOfBurgers(4, 17));  // Output: []
console.log(numOfBurgers(0, 0));   // Output: [0, 0]
console.log(numOfBurgers(2, 1));   // Output: [0, 1]
```

### Time Complexity
- The algorithm performs basic arithmetic operations and condition checks.
- Thus, the time complexity is \(O(1)\) (constant time).

The solution is efficient and handles the constraints provided.
