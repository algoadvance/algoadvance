[Leetcode 187. Repeated DNA Sequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l187)
### Problem Statement
The problem requires us to find all the 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that occur more than once in a DNA molecule. The DNA molecule is represented by a string containing characters 'A', 'C', 'G', and 'T'.

Given a string `s` that represents the DNA sequence, return a list of all 10-letter-long sequences (substrings) that appear more than once in the DNA molecule.

### Clarifying Questions
- **What should be the output when there are no repeated sequences?**
  - The output should be an empty array.
- **What is the maximum length for the input string `s`?**
  - The constraint might be provided in the problem description, but it's safe to assume a typical upper limit for such problems, like 10^5 characters.
- **Are there any edge cases we should consider?**
  - Input string length less than 10.
  - Handling cases where sequences overlap.
  
### Strategy
1. **Initialization and Data Structures**:
   - Use a set `seen` to track all 10-letter sequences we encounter.
   - Use another set `repeated` to track sequences that we have seen more than once.

2. **Iterate through the String**:
   - Slide a window of length 10 across the string.
   - For each substring, check if it is in `seen`:
     - If yes, add it to `repeated` set.
     - If no, add the substring to `seen` set.
   
3. **Convert Set to Result**:
   - Finally, convert the `repeated` set to an array and return it.

This approach ensures that each 10-letter sequence is checked and stored efficiently.

### Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string[]}
 */
var findRepeatedDnaSequences = function(s) {
    const seen = new Set();
    const repeated = new Set();
    
    for (let i = 0; i <= s.length - 10; i++) {
        const sequence = s.substring(i, i + 10);
        if (seen.has(sequence)) {
            repeated.add(sequence);
        } else {
            seen.add(sequence);
        }
    }
    
    return Array.from(repeated);
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Initialization**: Creating sets takes constant time.
- **Iteration**: We iterate over the string with a sliding window, which takes O(n) time where n is the length of the string.
- **Substring Operation**: Each substring operation inside the loop is O(1) since it involves constant time slicing.
- **Storage and Result Conversion**: In the worst case, the `repeated` set will store all possible 10-letter sequences resulting in O(1) per insertion (since the number of possible sequences is bounded and limited).

Overall, the time complexity is O(n), and the space complexity is O(n) due to storage in sets. This is efficient and handles the input constraints well.
