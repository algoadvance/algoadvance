[Leetcode 284. Peeking Iterator](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l284)
### Problem Statement:
Design an iterator that supports the `peek` operation on a given list of integers. Implement the `PeekingIterator` class:

- `PeekingIterator(int[] nums)` Initializes the object with the given integer array `nums`.
- `int next()` Returns the next element in the array and moves the pointer to the next element.
- `boolean hasNext()` Returns `true` if there are still elements in the array.
- `int peek()` Returns the next element in the array without moving the pointer.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Q:** Can we assume that the input array is non-empty?
   **A:** For this problem, you can assume that the input array is not empty. However, your implementation should handle cases where the iterator runs out of elements (i.e., methods like `hasNext` should return false appropriately).

2. **Q:** Are there any constraints regarding the data type of the elements in the array?
   **A:** The problem specifies that the elements are integers, so you can assume that all elements in the input array are integers.

### Strategy:
To implement the `PeekingIterator`, we can use an internal iterator and manage an additional variable to store the next element for the `peek` operation. This variable can be updated every time when `next` is called or when `peek` is required.

### Implementation:
Here is the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
class PeekingIterator {
  constructor(nums) {
    this.iterator = nums[Symbol.iterator](); // Internal iterator for the array
    this.nextElement = this.iterator.next(); // Initialize the first element
  }

  peek() {
    return this.nextElement.value; // Return the value of the next element
  }

  next() {
    let currentValue = this.nextElement.value;
    this.nextElement = this.iterator.next(); // Move to the next element
    return currentValue;
  }

  hasNext() {
    return !this.nextElement.done; // Check if the iteration is complete
  }
}

/**
 * Example usage:
 * const peekingIterator = new PeekingIterator([1, 2, 3]);
 * console.log(peekingIterator.peek());    // Output: 1
 * console.log(peekingIterator.next());    // Output: 1
 * console.log(peekingIterator.peek());    // Output: 2
 * console.log(peekingIterator.next());    // Output: 2
 * console.log(peekingIterator.next());    // Output: 3
 * console.log(peekingIterator.hasNext()); // Output: false
 */
```

### Time Complexity:
- The `peek` method has a time complexity of O(1) since it simply returns the already stored next element.
- The `next` method also has a time complexity of O(1) because it retrieves the current element and updates the next element using the internal iterator.
- The `hasNext` method has a time complexity of O(1) as it checks the `done` property of the iteratorâ€™s result.

This approach ensures that all operations (`peek`, `next`, `hasNext`) are efficient and work in constant time.
