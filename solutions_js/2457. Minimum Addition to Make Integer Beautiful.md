[Leetcode 2457. Minimum Addition to Make Integer Beautiful](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2457)
## Problem Statement

Given two positive integers `n` and `target`, you are tasked with finding the minimum positive integer `x` that can be added to `n` such that the sum of the digits of `n + x` is less than or equal to `target`.

For example:
1. Input: `n = 16`, `target = 6`
   Output: `x = 4` (since `16 + 4 = 20` and the sum of digits `2 + 0 = 2` which is ≤ `6`).
2. Input: `n = 467`, `target = 6`
   Output: `x = 533` (since `467 + 533 = 1000` and the sum of digits `1 + 0 + 0 + 0 = 1` which is ≤ `6`).

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are there any constraints on the size of `n` and `target`?
2. Should we assume that `x` will always exist?
3. Can we use built-in functions to convert numbers to strings for easier digit manipulation?

## Strategy
1. First, identify the need for `x` to modify `n` into a number where the digit sum is `≤ target`.
2. We aim to find the smallest `x` incrementally to satisfy this condition.
3. We can iterate and keep adding `1` to `n` until the condition `sum of digits(n + x) <= target` is satisfied. This approach, however, might be time-consuming for large `n`.
4. To optimize, we should look for leading digit modification. Once a threshold is met for a significant digit, the rest can be zeroed, minimizing the addition dynamically.

### Approach:
1. Convert `n` into its digit components.
2. Determine the sum of digits of `n`.
3. Incrementally add values to `n`, simplifying the process by focusing on digit sums and structural modifications to quickly lower the digit sum.

### Implementation

```javascript
var makeIntegerBeautiful = function(n, target) {
    const digitSum = (num) => num.toString().split('').reduce((sum, el) => sum + Number(el), 0);

    let addition = 0;
    
    while (digitSum(n + addition) > target) {
        // Increment values efficiently considering digit place optimizations
        let powerOf10 = 1;
        while ((n + addition) % powerOf10 === 0) {
            powerOf10 *= 10; // Skip zeros at the end which won't change sum of digits
        }
        addition += powerOf10 - (n + addition) % powerOf10; // Make increment that adjusts significantly
    }
    
    return addition;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(makeIntegerBeautiful(16, 6)); // Output: 4
console.log(makeIntegerBeautiful(467, 6)); // Output: 533
```

## Time Complexity
- In the worst-case scenario, our loop might iterate until `digitSum(n + addition)` fits the `target`.
- Every loop iteration optimizes via significant place jumps, i.e., the operations within the while loop efficiently handle digit increments.
- Expected Time Complexity: O(log n) where log base corresponds to decimal digit shifts.
