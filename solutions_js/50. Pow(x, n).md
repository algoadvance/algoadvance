[Leetcode 50. Pow(x, n)](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l50)
### Problem Statement:

Implement the `Pow(x, n)` function that calculates `x` raised to the power `n` (i.e., `x^n`).

**Example 1:**
```
Input: x = 2.00000, n = 10
Output: 1024.00000
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: x = 2.10000, n = 3
Output: 9.26100
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: x = 2.00000, n = -2
Output: 0.25000
Explanation: 2^(-2) = 1/(2^2) = 1/4 = 0.25
```

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q**: Can `n` be negative?
   - **A**: Yes, `n` can be negative, as shown in Example 3.
2. **Q**: What should the function return for `x = 0` and `n = 0`?
   - **A**: By convention, `0^0` is typically defined to be `1`.
3. **Q**: Should the solution handle very large values of `n` efficiently?
   - **A**: Yes, solutions are expected to handle large `n` efficiently, suggesting that a linear time complexity solution might not be optimal.

### Strategy:

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use the **Exponentiation by Squaring** method, which works in `O(log n)` time.

The idea is based on the following properties:
- `x^n` is `x` multiplied by itself `n` times.
- For an even `n`, `x^n` can be broken down into `((x^(n/2))^2)`.
- For an odd `n`, `x^n` can be written as `x * x^(n-1)`, and then the remaining part is handled similarly.

### Code:

```javascript
function myPow(x, n) {
    // Helper function to handle the core power calculation
    function power(x, n) {
        if (n === 0) return 1; // Base case: x^0 = 1
        if (n < 0) return 1 / power(x, -n); // Negative power: x^-n = 1 / x^n
        
        // Recursively calculate the power using exponentiation by squaring
        const half = power(x, Math.floor(n / 2));
        if (n % 2 === 0) {
            return half * half;
        } else {
            return half * half * x;
        }
    }
    
    return power(x, n);
}
```

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of the function `myPow` is `O(log n)`:
- The function reduces the problem size by half each step (`n / 2`), leading to logarithmic depth recursion.
- Each recursive step involves constant time operations.

### Explanation:

1. **Base Cases:**
   - If `n` is `0`, `x^0` is `1`.
   - If `n` is negative, the solution is given by `1 / power(x, -n)`.

2. **Recursion:**
   - For even `n`, recursively compute `half = power(x, n / 2)` and return `half * half`.
   - For odd `n`, compute similarly but include an extra `x` (i.e., return `half * half * x`).

By leveraging the properties of exponentiation by squaring, this approach ensures efficient computation even for large exponents.
