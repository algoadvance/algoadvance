## Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 71: Simplify Path

Given a string `path`, which is an absolute path (starting with a slash '/') to a file or directory in a Unix-style file system. Convert it to the simplified canonical path.

In a Unix-style file system, a period `'.'` refers to the current directory, a double period `'..'` refers to the directory up a level, and any multiple consecutive slashes (i.e. `'//'`) are treated as a single slash `'/'`. For this problem, any other format of periods such as `'...'` are treated as file/directory names.

The canonical path should have the following format:
1. The path starts with a single slash `'/'`.
2. Any two directories are separated by a single slash `'/'`.
3. The path does not end with a trailing `'/'`.
4. The path only contains the directories on the path from the root directory to the target file or directory (i.e., no period `'.'` or double period `'..'`).

Return the simplified canonical path.

## Example
```
Input: "/home//foo/"
Output: "/home/foo"
```
```
Input: "/../"
Output: "/"
```
```
Input: "/home/../../foo/"
Output: "/foo"
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Do we need to handle invalid paths with characters other than `/`, `.`, and alphanumeric characters?
2. Can the input string be empty?
3. Is the input string always a valid Unix path?

Assuming the input string is always a valid Unix path containing only the characters described above.

## Strategy

1. Split the input path by `'/'` to get all components.
2. Use a stack to build the simplified path by following these rules:
   - Skip empty components and single period `'.'`.
   - If the component is a double period `'..'`, pop from the stack (if not empty).
   - Otherwise, push the component onto the stack.
3. Join all components in the stack with a `'/'` to form the simplified path.
4. Ensure the path starts with a `'/'` and handle an empty stack by returning `'/'`.

## Code

```javascript
function simplifyPath(path) {
    const components = path.split('/');
    const stack = [];

    for (const component of components) {
        if (component === '' || component === '.') {
            continue;
        } else if (component === '..') {
            if (stack.length > 0) {
                stack.pop();
            }
        } else {
            stack.push(component);
        }
    }

    return '/' + stack.join('/');
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string `path`. We traverse the string to split it by `'/'`, and then we iterate through all components.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the number of components in the path. The stack can hold all components in the worst case.
