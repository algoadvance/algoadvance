[Leetcode 864. Shortest Path to Get All Keys](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l864)
### Problem Statement
You are given a map representing a grid where each cell is an empty cell represented by `'.'`, an obstacle represented by `'#'`, a starting point represented by `'@'`, keys represented by lowercase letters (`'a'` to `'f'`), and locks represented by uppercase letters (`'A'` to `'F'`). You start at the starting point and want to collect all the keys in the minimum number of steps.

You can move up, down, left, or right. You cannot walk on the obstacles. You can walk on or pass through the cells with keys and empty cells. You can only walk through a lock if you have collected its corresponding key. The goal is to find the shortest path that collects all the keys.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Grid Size Constraints**: What is the maximum size of the grid?
2. **Key and Lock Constraints**: Can we assume that there will be at most one key for each lock and vice versa?

### Strategy
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS)**: This is a classical shortest path problem on an unweighted grid graph, making BFS an ideal choice.
2. **State Representation**: Each state can be represented by the current position and the set of keys collected so far. We will use a bitmask integer to efficiently represent the set of collected keys.
3. **Visited States**: Maintain a visited set to avoid revisiting the same state (position and collected keys) to prevent cycles.
4. **Queue for BFS**: Use a queue to store the states as we explore the grid.

### Code
```javascript
function shortestPathAllKeys(grid) {
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;
    const directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]]; // Down, Up, Right, Left
    
    let startRow, startCol;
    let allKeys = 0; // Bitmask representing all keys
    
    // Find the start position and all keys
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === '@') {
                startRow = i;
                startCol = j;
            } else if (grid[i][j] >= 'a' && grid[i][j] <= 'f') {
                allKeys |= (1 << (grid[i][j].charCodeAt() - 'a'.charCodeAt()));
            }
        }
    }
    
    // BFS setup
    const queue = [[startRow, startCol, 0, 0]]; // [row, col, steps, keysBitmask]
    const visited = new Set();
    visited.add(`${startRow},${startCol},0`);

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const [row, col, steps, keys] = queue.shift();
        
        // Check if it's the goal state
        if (keys === allKeys) return steps;
        
        for (let [dr, dc] of directions) {
            const newRow = row + dr;
            const newCol = col + dc;
            
            if (newRow >= 0 && newRow < m && newCol >= 0 && newCol < n) {
                const cell = grid[newRow][newCol];
                
                // If it's a wall, skip it
                if (cell === '#') continue;
                
                // If it's a lock and we don't have the key, skip it
                if (cell >= 'A' && cell <= 'F' && !(keys & (1 << (cell.charCodeAt() - 'A'.charCodeAt())))) continue;
                
                let newKeys = keys;
                
                // If it's a key, pick it up
                if (cell >= 'a' && cell <= 'f') {
                    newKeys |= (1 << (cell.charCodeAt() - 'a'.charCodeAt()));
                }
                
                // If this new state hasn't been visited, add it to the queue
                const newState = `${newRow},${newCol},${newKeys}`;
                if (!visited.has(newState)) {
                    visited.add(newState);
                    queue.push([newRow, newCol, steps + 1, newKeys]);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    // If we exhaust the queue without finding all keys
    return -1;
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(m * n * 2^K)`, where `m` is the number of rows, `n` is the number of columns, and `K` is the maximum number of keys.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(m * n * 2^K)` for the BFS queue and the visited state set.

This solution ensures that we comprehensively search through all possible paths while keeping track of the keys collected to ensure the shortest path is identified.
