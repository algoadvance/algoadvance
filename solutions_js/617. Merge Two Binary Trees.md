[Leetcode 617. Merge Two Binary Trees](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l617)
### Problem Statement

You are given two binary trees, and you need to merge them into a single binary tree. The merging process follows these rules:
- If two nodes overlap, the sum of the two node values will become the new value for the merged node.
- Otherwise, the non-null node will be used as the node of the new tree.

The function signature is:
```javascript
function mergeTrees(t1: TreeNode | null, t2: TreeNode | null): TreeNode | null
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What if both input trees are null?**
   - The function should return `null` if both trees are empty.
   
2. **What is the structure of the TreeNode?**
   - A `TreeNode` is generally defined as:
     ```javascript
     class TreeNode {
         constructor(public val: number, public left: TreeNode | null = null, public right: TreeNode | null = null) {}
     }
     ```

3. **What should I return when only one node is available at a position in either tree?**
   - Return the node that is available.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to adopt a recursive approach to traverse both trees simultaneously. At each node, we will:
1. Check if both nodes from the two trees are present.
2. If both nodes are present, create a new node with the sum of these values, and recursively merge their left and right children.
3. If only one of the nodes is present, return that node.
4. If neither node is present, return `null`.

### Code

Here's how you can implement this strategy in JavaScript:

```javascript
class TreeNode {
    constructor(public val: number, public left: TreeNode | null = null, public right: TreeNode | null = null) {}
}

function mergeTrees(t1: TreeNode | null, t2: TreeNode | null): TreeNode | null {
    if (!t1 && !t2) {
        return null;
    }
    
    if (!t1) {
        return t2;
    }
    
    if (!t2) {
        return t1;
    }
    
    const mergedNode = new TreeNode(t1.val + t2.val);
    mergedNode.left = mergeTrees(t1.left, t2.left);
    mergedNode.right = mergeTrees(t1.right, t2.right);
    
    return mergedNode;
}

// Example usage:
const tree1 = new TreeNode(1, new TreeNode(3, new TreeNode(5)), new TreeNode(2));
const tree2 = new TreeNode(2, new TreeNode(1, null, new TreeNode(4)), new TreeNode(3, null, new TreeNode(7)));

const mergedTree = mergeTrees(tree1, tree2);
console.log(mergedTree); // Expected output: TreeNode { val: 3, left: TreeNode { val: 4, ... }, right: TreeNode { val: 5, ... }}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(N)**, where **N** is the total number of nodes in the tree with fewer nodes. This is because we traverse each node once to compute the merged tree.

The space complexity depends on the recursion stack. In the worst-case, the depth of the recursion stack can be the height of the tree, which would be **O(H)**, where **H** is the height of the tree.
