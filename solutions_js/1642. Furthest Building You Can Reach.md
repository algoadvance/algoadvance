[Leetcode 1642. Furthest Building You Can Reach](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1642)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `heights` representing the heights of buildings, some `bricks`, and some `ladders`.

You start at building 0 and move to the next building by possibly using bricks or ladders. While moving from building `i` to building `i+1` (0-indexed),

- If the current building's height is greater than or equal to the next building's height, you can move without using any resources.
- If the current building's height is less than the next building's height, you can either use some bricks or a ladder.

Returning the furthest building index (0-indexed) you can reach if you use the given supplies optimally.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the buildings always in a straight line?**
   - Yes, the buildings are in a straight line and you move only from left to right.

2. **Can bricks be used partially? Can ladders be reused?**
   - No, bricks cannot be used partially. Ladders cannot be reused once used.

3. **What happens if we run out of bricks and ladders?**
   - You need to return the highest index of the building you can reach before running out of resources.

4. **Are bricks always positive integers?**
   - Yes, the number of bricks and heights of buildings are always positive integers.

### Strategy

We need to determine how to optimally manage our resources (bricks and ladders). Here's the plan:

1. **Use a min-heap (priority queue) to simulate the usage of ladders over the highest jumps.** 
   - Every time when moving forward, if a jump is needed (the next building is higher), store that jump in the heap.
   
2. **If the heap size exceeds the number of ladders, replace the smallest ladder-used jump with bricks.**
   - This effectively allows us to use ladders for the largest jumps, which leaves smaller jumps to consume bricks more efficiently.

3. **Continue this process until bricks are exhausted.**

Given the constraints, this greedy approach ensures that we get the maximum reach by optimally using ladders for the highest jumps.

### Code

```javascript
var furthestBuilding = function(heights, bricks, ladders) {
    let minHeap = new MinPriorityQueue(); // To store the height differences where ladders have been used

    for (let i = 0; i < heights.length - 1; i++) {
        let diff = heights[i+1] - heights[i];

        if (diff > 0) {
            minHeap.enqueue(diff);
        }

        if (minHeap.size() > ladders) {
            bricks -= minHeap.dequeue().element;
        }

        if (bricks < 0) {
            return i;
        }
    }

    return heights.length - 1;
};
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Initialization:**
   - A min-heap (priority queue) is initialized to keep track of the height differences where we would ideally want to use ladders.

2. **Iterate Through Each Building:**
   - For each building `i`, calculate the difference (`diff`) between the current building and the next one.
   - If `diff` is positive (i.e., the next building is higher), push this difference into the heap.

3. **Manage the Heap Size to Reflect Ladders Usage:**
   - Check if the size of the heap exceeds the number of ladders. If it does, it means we have more height differences stored than the available ladders.
   - Dequeue the smallest height difference from the heap (i.e., use bricks for the smallest climb) and reduce the number of bricks accordingly.
   
4. **Check If Bricks Are Exhausted:**
   - At any point, if the number of bricks becomes negative, it means we've run out of bricks to use. The current index is the furthest we can reach with the available resources.

5. **Return Result:**
   - If we can traverse all buildings with the available bricks and ladders, return the last index.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity is `O(n log k)` where `n` is the number of buildings and `k` is the number of ladders. 
- The operations involving the min-heap (enqueue and dequeue) are `O(log k)` and this is done for each building, resulting in the final time complexity.

This is the optimal approach to solve the problem given the constraints and ensures you make the furthest building utilizing resources efficiently.
