[Leetcode 2767. Partition String Into Minimum Beautiful Substrings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2767)
## Problem Statement

You are asked to partition a string into the minimum number of beautiful substrings. A beautiful substring is a substring that represents a number in binary format that is a power of 5.

Given a binary string `s`, return the minimum number of beautiful substrings that the string can be split into. The numbers are allowed to have leading zeros, except the number '0' itself which is not considered a beautiful number. If it is not possible to partition the string into beautiful substrings, return -1.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the input always valid binary strings?**
   - Yes, the problem implies that the input will always be a valid binary string.
   
2. **What is the range of the length of the string?**
   - The problem itself may not specify the exact range, but let’s assume it fits within typical constraints for algorithmic problems (e.g., up to 10^4).

3. **Can substrings overlap?**
   - No, partitions should be non-overlapping.

4. **Do we know the maximum length of beautiful substrings?**
   - No specific length, but since it's a partition problem, we need to explore possibilities from shortest to longest ensuring they are powers of 5.

## Strategy

1. **Precompute Powers of 5:**
   - Compute all binary representations of powers of 5 that fit within the length of the string `s`.

2. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - Use a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the minimum number of beautiful substrings in the substring `s[0:i]`.
   - Initialize `dp[0] = 0` (base case) and `dp[i] = ∞` for other indices.
   - Iterate through the string and for each substring `s[j:i]` check if it is a beautiful substring (a binary representation of a power of 5). If it is, update `dp[i]` as `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`.

3. **Return Result:**
   - Return `dp[n]` where `n` is the length of the string `s`. If `dp[n]` is still ∞, return -1 since it's not possible to partition the string.

## Code

Here's the implementation of the strategy described:

```javascript
function isBeautiful(s) {
    // Convert binary string to integer
    let num = parseInt(s, 2);
    // Check if the number is a power of 5
    if (num === 0) return false;
    while (num % 5 === 0) {
        num /= 5;
    }
    return num === 1;
}

function minimumBeautifulSubstrings(s) {
    const n = s.length;
    const dp = Array(n + 1).fill(Infinity);
    dp[0] = 0;
    
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            const substr = s.slice(j, i);
            if (isBeautiful(substr)) {
                dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n] === Infinity ? -1 : dp[n];
}

// Example usage:
console.log(minimumBeautifulSubstrings("101101011")) // Example input
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Precomputation of Powers of 5:** 
   - Not needed separately as we are checking in-line with `isBeautiful`.
   
2. **Dynamic Programming Update:** 
   - We need to check each substring in worst case which results in a time complexity of `O(n^3)` due to nested loops and string slicing.

   **Overall Complexity:** `O(n^3)`
