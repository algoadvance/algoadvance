[Leetcode 1981. Minimize the Difference Between Target and Chosen Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1981)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` integer matrix `mat` and an integer `target`.

Choose one integer from each row in the matrix such that the absolute difference between `target` and the sum of the chosen elements is minimized.

Return the minimum absolute difference.

### Example:
1. Input: `mat = [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], target = 13`
2. Output: `0`

There would be multiple values that sum up to `13`, the absolute difference is `0`.

### Constraints:
1. `m == mat.length`
2. `n == mat[i].length`
3. `1 <= m, n <= 70`
4. `1 <= mat[i][j] <= 70`
5. `1 <= target <= 800`

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q**: Should I always assume there is a solution?
   - **A**: Yes, but we are looking for the minimum absolute difference rather than a precise target.

2. **Q**: What if there are multiple sums achieving the same difference?
   - **A**: Any one of them is acceptable.

3. **Q**: Can the chosen element from a row be repeated?
   - **A**: No, each row contributes exactly one element to the sum.

## Strategy

Given the constraints, a brute-force approach would be inefficient. Instead, we can use dynamic programming.

### Dynamic Programming (DP) Strategy:

1. **Initialization**: Start with the first row.
2. **State Transition**: For each subsequent row, update DP states by adding elements of that row to the sums from the previous rows.
3. **Base Case**: Start at `0` difference for the first row elements.
4. **Optimization**: Use a set to avoid duplicate sums and reduce space complexity.

### Steps:
1. Initialize a set `dp` with elements from the first row.
2. For each subsequent row:
   - Create a new set `new_dp`.
   - For each element in the current row, and each sum in `dp`, add the element to the sum and store in `new_dp`.
3. Update `dp` to `new_dp`.
4. After processing all rows, find the minimum absolute difference from `target`.

### Time Complexity:
- `O(m * n * S)`, where `S` is the highest possible sum up to that row, constrained roughly by `target + max sum adjustment`.

## Code

```javascript
var minimizeTheDifference = function(mat, target) {
    let dp = new Set(mat[0]);
    
    for (let i = 1; i < mat.length; i++) {
        let new_dp = new Set();
        
        mat[i].forEach(el => {
            dp.forEach(sum => {
                new_dp.add(sum + el);
            });
        });
        
        dp = new_dp;
    }

    let minDiff = Infinity;

    dp.forEach(sum => {
        minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, Math.abs(target - sum));
    });

    return minDiff;
};

// Example test case
console.log(minimizeTheDifference([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,9]], 13));  // Output: 0
```

### Explanation:
1. We start with the first row, initializing `dp` with those values.
2. We iteratively build possible sums by incorporating elements from each subsequent row.
3. After processing all rows, we calculate and return the minimum absolute difference from the target.

### Additional Edge Cases:
- Matrix with minimum size (1x1).
- Target smaller or larger than the sum of any possible combinations.

By following this strategy, we ensure an optimal approach to solving the problem within the given constraints effectively.
