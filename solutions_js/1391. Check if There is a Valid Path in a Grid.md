[Leetcode 1391. Check if There is a Valid Path in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1391)
**Problem Statement:**

You are given an `m x n` grid. Each cell of the grid contains integers representing street types between `1` and `6` inclusive:

- Street Type `1`: Horizontal street left and right.
- Street Type `2`: Vertical street top and down.
- Street Type `3`: Connects top left to bottom right (↘).
- Street Type `4`: Connects top right to bottom left (↙).
- Street Type `5`: Connects top left to top right (↔).
- Street Type `6`: Connects bottom left to bottom right (↔).

Your task is to determine if there is a valid path that begins at the top-left corner of the grid and ends at the bottom-right corner of the grid. The grid is connected if you can move exactly according to the direction of the streets. 

Return `true` if there's a valid path; otherwise, `return false`.

**Clarifying Questions:**

1. Are there any constraints on the grid dimensions (m and n)?
   - Yes, `1 <= m, n <= 300`.

2. Can we assume that every cell in the grid is within the range 1 to 6?
   - Yes, each cell is guaranteed to have a street type from 1 to 6.

3. Are diagonal movements allowed?
   - No, movements follow strictly the connections defined by each street type, involving only horizontal and vertical directions.

**Strategy:**

To solve this problem, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. Here's the step-by-step strategy:

1. Initialize a queue and add the starting position `(0, 0)` to it. Also, keep a set of visited positions to avoid revisiting cells.

2. For each position, determine the next possible move based on the current cell's street type. Use a mapping of street type to possible connections.

3. Check each of the possible directions to see if a move to the neighboring cell is valid (i.e., the street types of the current and neighboring cells are compatible).

4. If the bottom-right corner is reached, return `true`.

5. If the queue is exhausted without reaching the bottom-right corner, return `false`.

**Code:**

```javascript
function hasValidPath(grid) {
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;

    // Map from street value to their directions and compatible neighbors
    const directions = {
        1: [[0, -1], [0, 1]],    // left -> right (↔)
        2: [[-1, 0], [1, 0]],    // top -> down (↕)
        3: [[0, -1], [1, 0]],    // ↘ (connects left-top to bottom-right)
        4: [[0, 1], [1, 0]],     // ↙ (connects right-top to bottom-left)
        5: [[0, -1], [-1, 0]],   // ↔ (connects left-top to right-bottom)
        6: [[-1, 0], [0, 1]]     // ↔ (connects top-bottom to right-left?)
    };

    const isConnected = (x1, y1, x2, y2) => {
        const street1 = grid[x1][y1];
        const street2 = grid[x2][y2];
        
        // Check opposite corresponding direction links
        if (street1 === 1 && street2 === 1) return true;
        if (street1 === 2 && street2 === 2) return true;
        if (street1 === 3 && street2 === 5) return true;
        if (street1 === 4 && street2 === 6) return true;
        if (street1 === 5 && (street2 === 3 || street2 === 2)) return true;
        if (street1 === 6 && street2 === 2) return true;

        return false;
    };

    const queue = [[0, 0]];
    const visited = new Set(['0,0']);

    while (queue.length > 0){
        const [x, y] = queue.shift();

        if (x === m - 1 && y === n - 1){
            return true;
        }

        for (const [dx, dy] of directions[grid[x][y]]){
            const nx = x + dx;
            const ny = y + dy;

            if (nx >= 0 && nx < m && ny >= 0 && ny < n && !visited.has(`${nx},${ny}`)){
                if (isConnected(x, y, nx, ny)){
                    queue.push([nx, ny]);
                    visited.add(`${nx},${ny}`);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return false;
}
```

**Time Complexity:**
The time complexity of this solution is O(m * n) because we potentially visit every cell in the grid once. The space complexity is also O(m * n) due to the usage of the queue and the visited set for tracking the visited cells.
