[Leetcode 1432. Max Difference You Can Get From Changing an Integer](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1432)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer `num`, you are allowed to swap exactly one digit with any other digit (including itself) at most once, resulting in a new integer. You need to find the **maximum difference** between the resulting integers that you can obtain from such a swap.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the swapped digits be in the leading position?**
   - Yes, any digit can be swapped, which includes digits in the leading positions.
2. **Is there any constraint on the size of the integer?**
   - The constraints are usually within the standard limits, but specifics should be checked against the problem statement. Typically, it can be assumed that `num` is within the range of 32-bit integers.
3. **What should be the range of the input digits?**
   - The input will be a valid positive integer.

### Strategy
1. **For Maximum Value:**
   - To achieve the maximum possible integer by swapping, identify the first non-9 digit and swap it with '9'.
2. **For Minimum Value:**
   - To achieve the minimum possible integer by swapping, identify the first digit that is greater than '1' and swap it with '1'. This digit change must consider non-leading zeroes.
   
### Steps:
1. Convert the integer to a string for easy manipulation of individual digits.
2. Iterate through the digits to determine the maximum and minimum possible values after at most one swap.
3. Calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum values obtained.

### Code

```javascript
function maxDiff(num) {
    let numStr = num.toString();
    
    // Maximize num by changing the first non-9 digit to 9
    let maxStr = numStr;
    for (let digit of numStr) {
        if (digit !== '9') {
            maxStr = numStr.split(digit).join('9');
            break;
        }
    }
    
    // Minimize num by changing the first digit that isn't 1 or 0 (and not leading)
    let minStr = numStr;
    if (numStr[0] !== '1') {
        minStr = numStr.split(numStr[0]).join('1');
    } else {
        for (let i = 1; i < numStr.length; i++) {
            if (numStr[i] !== '0' && numStr[i] !== '1') {
                minStr = numStr.split(numStr[i]).join('0');
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return parseInt(maxStr) - parseInt(minStr);
}

// Example usage:
console.log(maxDiff(123456));  // Output: 820000 (923456 - 103456)
console.log(maxDiff(10000));   // Output: 90000 (90000 - 10000)
console.log(maxDiff(9288));    // Output: 8700 (9888 - 1188)
```

### Time Complexity
- Constructing the string versions of the number takes \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of digits in the number.
- The process involves a single pass through the digits and possibly another pass for replacements, yielding an overall time complexity of \(O(n)\).

The solution efficiently handles the manipulation by leveraging string operations for clarity and simplicity.
