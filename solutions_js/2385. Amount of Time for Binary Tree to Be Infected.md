[Leetcode 2385. Amount of Time for Binary Tree to Be Infected](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2385)
### Problem Statement

You are given the `root` of a binary tree with `n` nodes, each represented by a unique value, and an integer `start` which denotes the value of the node where the infection starts. Each infected node infects its immediate left, right, and parent nodes exactly 1 second after getting infected.

Return the number of seconds needed for the entire tree to be infected.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the structure of the tree nodes?**
   - The tree is a typical binary tree where each node has a left child, a right child, and a value.

2. **Are there any constraints on the values of nodes or the `start` index?**
   - All node values are unique, and `1 <= n <= 10^5`.

3. **Is the tree balanced or can it be skewed?**
   - The tree can be either balanced or skewed.

Now let's proceed to the solution.

### Strategy

1. **Step 1: Tree Traversal and Graph Conversion**
   - Convert the tree structure into a graph using Breadth-First Search (BFS). This graph will help us to easily manage connections between nodes including the parent relationship.

2. **Step 2: BFS to Calculate Infection Spread Time**
   - Use another BFS starting from the `start` node to determine the minimum time required to infect all nodes. Track the time taken to infect each node using a visited set to prevent re-infection.

### Code

Here is the JavaScript code to solve the problem:

```javascript
class TreeNode {
  constructor(val, left = null, right = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
  }
}

const amountOfTime = (root, start) => {
  if (!root) return 0;

  const graph = new Map();

  const buildGraph = (node, parent) => {
    if (node === null) return;

    if (!graph.has(node.val)) {
      graph.set(node.val, []);
    }
    if (parent !== null) {
      graph.get(node.val).push(parent.val);
      graph.get(parent.val).push(node.val);
    }
    if (node.left !== null) {
      buildGraph(node.left, node);
    }
    if (node.right !== null) {
      buildGraph(node.right, node);
    }
  };
  
  buildGraph(root, null);
  
  const queue = [start];
  const visited = new Set(queue);
  let time = -1;

  while (queue.length > 0) {
    let size = queue.length;
    for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
      const node = queue.shift();
      for (const neighbor of graph.get(node)) {
        if (!visited.has(neighbor)) {
          visited.add(neighbor);
          queue.push(neighbor);
        }
      }
    }
    time++;
  }

  return time;
};
```

### Explanation

1. **TreeNode Class**: This is the basic structure for tree nodes with `val`, `left`, and `right` properties.
   
2. **buildGraph Function**: This function traverses the tree and builds an adjacency list representing the graph. Each node maintains a list of its neighbors (left, right, and parent).

3. **BFS for Infection Spread**:
   - Initialize the queue with the `start` node and track visited nodes.
   - Process nodes level by level, increasing the infection time by one unit for each level processed.
   - Continue until all nodes are infected, represented by the queue being empty.

### Time Complexity

- **Conversion to Graph**: O(n) where `n` is the number of nodes, as each node is visited once.
- **BFS for Infection**: O(n), as each node is processed once.
- **Overall Time Complexity**: O(n)

This solution ensures efficient traversal and infection spread in a large binary tree.
