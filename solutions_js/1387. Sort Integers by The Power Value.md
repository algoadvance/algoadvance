[Leetcode 1387. Sort Integers by The Power Value](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1387)
### Problem Statement

The power of an integer `x` is defined as the number of steps needed to transform `x` into `1` using the following process:
- If `x` is even, divide it by `2`.
- If `x` is odd, multiply it by `3` and add `1`.

For example, the power of `3` is `7` because `3 -> 10 -> 5 -> 16 -> 8 -> 4 -> 2 -> 1`.

Given three integers `lo`, `hi`, and `k`, the task is to sort all integers in the interval `[lo, hi]` by the power value and return the k-th integer in the sorted list.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should happen in case of a tie in the power value?**
   - If two numbers have the same power value, sort them by integer value (ascending).

2. **What are the lower and upper limits for `lo`, `hi`, and `k`?**
   - `1 <= lo <= hi <= 1000`
   - `1 <= k <= hi - lo + 1`

3. **Are there any constraints on performance or time that we should be aware of?**
   - The constraints suggest that the range and values are small, so a straightforward approach should be acceptable.

### Strategy

1. **Precompute Power Values**: Create a function to calculate the power value for any given integer.
2. **Store Power Values**: Store these power values in a dictionary to avoid recomputation.
3. **Sort and Retrieve**: Create a list of integers from `lo` to `hi`, sort them based on their power values (and integer value in case of tie), and return the k-th element in the sorted list.

### Code

```javascript
function getPowerValue(x) {
    let steps = 0;
    while (x !== 1) {
        if (x % 2 === 0) {
            x = x / 2;
        } else {
            x = 3 * x + 1;
        }
        steps += 1;
    }
    return steps;
}

function getKth(lo, hi, k) {
    let powerValues = {};
    
    for (let i = lo; i <= hi; i++) {
        powerValues[i] = getPowerValue(i);
    }
    
    let sortedList = Array.from({length: hi - lo + 1}, (_, idx) => lo + idx);
    
    sortedList.sort((a, b) => {
        let powerA = powerValues[a];
        let powerB = powerValues[b];
        
        if (powerA === powerB) {
            return a - b;
        }
        return powerA - powerB;
    });
    
    return sortedList[k - 1];
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Calculating Power Values**: In the worst case, calculating the power value for a number could take `O(log n)` where `n` is the number itself. Thus, for all numbers from `lo` to `hi`, the total computation for power values is `O((hi - lo + 1) * log(hi))`.
2. **Sorting**: Sorting the list takes `O(n log n)` where `n = hi - lo + 1`.
3. **Overall Complexity**: Combining these steps, the overall time complexity would be `O((hi - lo + 1) * log(hi) + (hi - lo + 1) * log(hi - lo + 1))`. Simplifying, the overall complexity is `O((hi - lo + 1) * (log hi + log (hi - lo + 1)))`.

Given typical constraints, this approach should be efficient enough.
