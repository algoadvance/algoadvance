[Leetcode 2508. Add Edges to Make Degrees of All Nodes Even](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2508)
### Problem Statement

Given an undirected graph with `n` nodes labeled from `1` to `n`, and a list of `edges` where each `edge` is a pair of integers `[u, v]` representing an edge between nodes `u` and `v`, your task is to determine if it's possible to add at most 2 edges to the graph such that the degree of each node becomes even.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum value of `n`?
   - Can the graph contain self-loops or multiple edges between the same pair of nodes?
   
2. **Output:**
   - What should be the output format if it's possible to make all degrees even with at most 2 edges? Just a boolean (`true`/`false`)?

Assuming the graph doesnâ€™t have multiple edges or self-loops, and `n` can be large (e.g., up to `10^5`).

### Strategy

1. **Degree Calculation:** 
   - Compute the degree of each node.
   
2. **Odd Degree Nodes:**
   - Identify all nodes that have an odd degree.
   
3. **Possibilities Based on Count of Odd Degree Nodes:**
   - **0 Odd Degree Nodes:**
     - No need to add any edges.
   - **2 Odd Degree Nodes:**
     - Check if adding an edge between these two nodes makes all degrees even.
   - **4 Odd Degree Nodes:**
     - Check if there are two node pairs among these four that, when connected, will all have even degrees.
   - **Other Cases (like 1, 3 or more than 4 odd degree nodes):**
     - Returning `false` as it's not possible to make all degrees even.

### Code

```javascript
function canMakeAllDegreesEven(n, edges) {
    const degree = Array(n + 1).fill(0);

    // Calculate the degrees of all nodes.
    for (const [u, v] of edges) {
        degree[u]++;
        degree[v]++;
    }

    // Find all nodes with an odd degree.
    const oddDegreeNodes = [];
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        if (degree[i] % 2 === 1) {
            oddDegreeNodes.push(i);
        }
    }
    
    if (oddDegreeNodes.length === 0) {
        return true;
    }
    if (oddDegreeNodes.length === 2) {
        const [a, b] = oddDegreeNodes;

        // They can be directly connected if they are not already connected.
        if (!edges.some(([u, v]) => (u === a && v === b) || (u === b && v === a))) {
            return true;
        }
        
        // Check if there is an unused node to connect them to.
        for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
            if (![a, b].includes(i) && !edges.some(([u, v]) => (u === a && v === i) || (u === i && v === a) || (u === b && v === i) || (u === i && v === b))) {
                return true;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }
    if (oddDegreeNodes.length === 4) {
        const [a, b, c, d] = oddDegreeNodes;

        // Check for pair combinations (a-b and c-d or a-c and b-d etc.),
        const pairs = [
            [a, b, c, d],
            [a, c, b, d],
            [a, d, b, c],
        ];

        for (const [x1, y1, x2, y2] of pairs) {
            if (
                !edges.some(([u, v]) => (u === x1 && v === y1) || (u === y1 && v === x1)) &&
                !edges.some(([u, v]) => (u === x2 && v === y2) || (u === y2 && v === x2))
            ) {
                return true;
            }
        }

        return false;
    }

    return false;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- Calculating the degree: O(E) where E is the number of edges.
- Identifying odd degree nodes: O(n) where n is the number of nodes.
- Checking pairs to connect: O(1) since it's a fixed number of operations regardless of `n` and `E`.

Hence, the worst-case time complexity is O(n + E).
