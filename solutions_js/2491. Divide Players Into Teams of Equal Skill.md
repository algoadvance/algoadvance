[Leetcode 2491. Divide Players Into Teams of Equal Skill](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2491)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of integers, where each integer represents the skill level of a player. Your task is to divide these players into pairs such that the sum of the skill levels of each pair is equal. If it's possible, return the sum of the minimum values of each pair; otherwise, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the range of the number of players? (e.g., 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5)
   - What range do the skill levels fall into? (e.g., 1 ≤ skill[i] ≤ 10^9)
   - Is the array always even length, ensuring we can always form pairs?

2. **Output**:
   - If players can be paired as required, we return the sum of the minimum skill levels in each pair.
   - If the players cannot be paired such that all pairs have equal skill sum, we return -1.

### Strategy

1. **Sum Calculation**:
   - Calculate the total sum of the skill levels.
   - If the total sum is not divisible by the number of players divided by 2, then it is impossible to pair players equally.

2. **Sorting and Pairing**:
   - Sort the array of skill levels.
   - Use two pointers, one starting from the beginning (`left`) and one from the end (`right`), to form pairs.
   - Calculate the skill sum of each pair. If any pair sum is not equal, return -1.

3. **Sum Up Minimum Values**:
   - While forming pairs, if all pairs have equal skill sum, collect the minimum values from each pair and sum them up to form the final result.

### Time Complexity

The primary operations involve sorting the skill levels array, which takes O(n log n), and then linear traversal to form pairs, which takes O(n). Therefore, the overall time complexity is dominated by the sort operation, making it O(n log n).

Let's proceed with the implementation.

### Code

```javascript
var dividePlayers = function(skill) {
    const n = skill.length;

    // Step 1: Check if sum of skills can be equally divided
    const totalSum = skill.reduce((sum, val) => sum + val, 0);
    if (totalSum % (n / 2) !== 0) return -1;

    const targetSum = totalSum / (n / 2);

    // Step 2: Sort the skill levels
    skill.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    // Step 3: Pairing using two pointers from start and end
    let left = 0, right = n - 1;
    let result = 0;

    while (left < right) {
        if (skill[left] + skill[right] !== targetSum) {
            return -1;
        }
        result += skill[left]; // add the minimum value of the pair
        left++;
        right--;
    }

    return result;
};

// Example usage
console.log(dividePlayers([1, 2, 3, 6])); // Output: -1
console.log(dividePlayers([1, 1, 2, 2])); // Output: 2
```

### Explanation

1. **Sum Calculation**: We calculated the total sum of the skill levels and the target sum for each pair.
2. **Sorting**: The skill array is sorted to facilitate the two-pointer technique.
3. **Pairing and Summing**: Paired elements are checked to ensure they sum to the target. If all pairs match the target, the result is computed by summing the minimums. If any pair fails, the function returns -1.

This solution efficiently handles the problem within the expected constraints.
