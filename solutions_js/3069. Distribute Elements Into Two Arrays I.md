[Leetcode 3069. Distribute Elements Into Two Arrays I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3069)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` consisting of positive integers and two non-negative integers `a` and `b`. Your task is to distribute the elements of `nums` into two new arrays such that the sums of the elements in each of the two arrays are as close as possible to `a` and `b`, respectively. The total sum of elements in `nums` will be equal to `a + b`.

Write a function to achieve this:

```javascript
function distributeElements(nums, a, b) {
    // Your code here
}
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is it guaranteed that the sum of elements in `nums` will be exactly `a + b`?**
   - Yes, it's given that the total sum of elements in `nums` equals `a + b`.

2. **Are there any constraints on the size of `nums`?**
   - The problem doesn't mention specific constraints. Assume `nums` length is manageable within typical coding interview constraints (e.g., less than 100 elements).

3. **Can `a` or `b` be zero?**
   - Yes, they can be zero, which means one of the arrays might end up being empty.

4. **Do we need to return both arrays, or something more specific like their sums?**
   - Assume we need to return both arrays.

### Strategy

This problem is similar to the partition problem, which is a variant of the subset-sum problem, a classic problem in computer science. Our goal is to find a distribution of elements in such a way that one array's sum is as close as possible to `a` and the other to `b`. Since the sum of all elements is equal to `a + b`, we can aim to partition the array such that one subset sum is close to `a`, and the remainder will automatically be close to `b`.

A greedy approach might not always lead to an optimal solution due to the zero-sum constraint, so a dynamic programming approach or a backtracking approach would be more appropriate.

### Code

Here's a possible implementation using recursion with memoization to keep track of subsets that add up to specific sums:

```javascript
function distributeElements(nums, a, b) {
    const total = a + b;
    // Memoization
    const memo = {};

    function canPartition(index, currentSum) {
        // Base case
        if (index >= nums.length) {
            return null;
        }
        if (currentSum === a) {
            return [];
        }
        const key = `${index}-${currentSum}`;

        if (key in memo) {
            return memo[key];
        }

        // Include nums[index] in the current subset
        const include = canPartition(index + 1, currentSum + nums[index]);
        if (include !== null) {
            memo[key] = [nums[index], ...include];
            return memo[key];
        }

        // Exclude nums[index] from the current subset
        const exclude = canPartition(index + 1, currentSum);
        memo[key] = exclude;

        return memo[key];
    }

    const subsetA = canPartition(0, 0);
    const subsetASet = new Set(subsetA);
    const subsetB = nums.filter(num => !subsetASet.has(num));

    return [subsetA, subsetB];
}

// Example use
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
const a = 10;
const b = 11;
console.log(distributeElements(nums, a, b)); // Output will vary depending if there is a feasible partition.
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: This solution has a worst-case time complexity of `O(n * a)`, where `n` is the length of `nums`. This is due to the memoization table that stores results for subset sums up to `a` for each index.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is also `O(n * a)` due to the memoization table and call stack depth.

Please adjust the logic and handle edge cases as needed. The memoized approach improves performance, but you will need to carefully design the memoization keys and handle the final partitioning logic.
