[Leetcode 955. Delete Columns to Make Sorted II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l955)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of `n` strings `strs`, all of the same length.

We need to delete the minimum number of columns so that each remaining row is in non-decreasing sorted order individually.

Return the minimum number of columns that you need to delete.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: strs = ["ca","bb","ac"]
Output: 1
Explanation: 
After deleting the first column, strs = ["a", "b", "c"]. Now strs is sorted.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all the strings guaranteed to be of the same length?**
   - Yes, the problem statement mentions that all strings are of the same length.
   
2. **Can the input list be empty or contain only one string?**
   - The problem description implies that `n` (the number of strings) can be at least one, but deleting columns wouldn't apply if there's only one string.

3. **What should be the behavior if the strings are initially sorted?**
   - If the strings are already sorted, the number of columns to delete should be zero.

### Strategy

1. Iterate through each column of the strings.
2. For each column, check if deleting it helps maintain a non-decreasing order across all rows.
3. Use a boolean array to keep track of rows that are sorted due to previously processed columns.
4. Update the boolean array when a new column is checked.

### Code

Here's the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function minDeletionSize(strs) {
    const n = strs.length;
    const m = strs[0].length;
    let count = 0;
    let sorted = new Array(n - 1).fill(false);

    for (let col = 0; col < m; col++) {
        let deleteColumn = false;

        for (let row = 0; row < n - 1; row++) {
            if (!sorted[row] && strs[row][col] > strs[row + 1][col]) {
                deleteColumn = true;
                break;
            }
        }

        if (deleteColumn) {
            count++;
        } else {
            for (let row = 0; row < n - 1; row++) {
                if (strs[row][col] < strs[row + 1][col]) {
                    sorted[row] = true;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
}

// Example usage:
const strs = ["ca", "bb", "ac"];
console.log(minDeletionSize(strs)); // Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n * m)** where `n` is the number of strings and `m` is the length of each string. This is because we go through each column, and for each column, we may check all the rows once to decide whether to delete that column.
