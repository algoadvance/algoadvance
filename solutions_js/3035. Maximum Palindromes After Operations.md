[Leetcode 3035. Maximum Palindromes After Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3035)
## Problem Statement
You are given a string `s`. You are allowed to perform one move, where you can remove one character of the string. Your task is to determine the length of the longest palindromic subsequence you can achieve after performing this operation.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the maximum length of string `s`?
   - What characters does `s` consist of? (Assuming it is lowercase English letters)

2. **Output**:
   - Are we always guaranteed to have at least one move (i.e., the length of `s` > 1)?

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - What if the string `s` is already a palindrome?
   - What is the expected behavior if no character needs to be removed?

## Strategy

1. **Step 1: Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LPS)**:
   - First, we need to understand how to calculate the longest palindromic subsequence (LPS) of a string. A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from another sequence by deleting some elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

2. **Step 2: Calculate LPS for All Variants**:
   - We will calculate the LPS of the substring resulting from the removal of each character from the original string.
   - Track the maximum LPS value obtained from these substrings.

## Code
Here's the JavaScript function to address the problem:

```javascript
function longestPalindromeSubseq(s) {
    const n = s.length;
    const dp = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(0));
    
    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        dp[i][i] = 1; // A single character is always a palindrome of length 1
        for (let j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (s[i] === s[j]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 2;
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }
    return dp[0][n - 1];
}

function maxPalindromeAfterOneRemoval(s) {
    let maxLPSLength = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        const newStr = s.slice(0, i) + s.slice(i + 1);
        const lpsLength = longestPalindromeSubseq(newStr);
        maxLPSLength = Math.max(maxLPSLength, lpsLength);
    }
    return maxLPSLength;
}

// Example usage:
const s = "abca";
console.log(maxPalindromeAfterOneRemoval(s)); // Output: 3
```

## Explanation

1. **Longest Palindromic Subsequence (LPS)**:
   - We use dynamic programming (DP) to compute the LPS. The array `dp[i][j]` stores the length of the LPS in the substring from index `i` to `j`.
     - If `s[i] === s[j]`, `dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 2`.
     - Otherwise, `dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1])`.

2. **Maximize LPS After One Removal**:
   - We iterate through each character in the string, remove it, compute the LPS for the resulting substring, and track the maximum LPS found.

## Time Complexity
- **Longest Palindromic Subsequence Calculation (LPS)**:
  - Constructing the DP table takes \(O(n^2)\), where \(n\) is the length of string `s`.

- **Removing Each Character and Computing LPS**:
  - For each of the \(n\) substrings formed by removing one character, calling `longestPalindromeSubseq` takes \(O(n^2)\).

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n^3)\). This approach may not be optimal for very large strings but should work within reasonable constraints.
