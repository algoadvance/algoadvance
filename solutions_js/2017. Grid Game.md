[Leetcode 2017. Grid Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2017)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 2D grid of size 2 x n. Initially, 2 robots are placed on various cells of this grid. The robots need to move from left to right, starting from column `0`. Once a robot moves to a cell in column `j`, no robot can move to column `j` again. Bob moves first and he tries to minimize his score while Alice tries to maximize her score. The robots can either move from the top row at column j to the next column on the same row or move from the bottom row at column j to the next column on the same row.

Given a 2D grid filled with integers, find the maximum points Alice can get. 

**Example:**

```
Input: grid = [[2,5,4], [1,5,1]]
Output: 4
Explanation:
Bob will move to (0, 1) -> (0, 0). The score will be 2.
Alice will move to (0, 2) -> (1, 2). The score will be 4.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. What are the constraints on the value of `n` (length of the grid)?
2. Can the grid contain negative values?
3. Should the solution only focus on the optimal strategy for Alice, or do we also need to consider Bob's strategy?

## Strategy

We need to find the optimal strategy for Alice, assuming Bob plays optimally to minimize Alice's score.

1. **Prefix Sum Arrays:** We will create two prefix sum arrays: one for the top row and one for the bottom row.
2. **Score Calculation:** For each possible column `j`, calculate the score. This calculation considers that Bob will choose the column that minimizes Alice's possible scores.
3. **Iterate Over Columns:** We will iterate over all columns `j` and calculate the points Alice will get if she moves from any column and Bob tries to minimize her points.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} grid
 * @return {number}
 */
var gridGame = function(grid) {
    const n = grid[0].length;

    // Step 1: Prefix sum arrays for both rows
    const topPrefix = new Array(n).fill(0);
    const bottomPrefix = new Array(n).fill(0);
    
    // Compute prefix sums for the top row
    topPrefix[0] = grid[0][0];
    for(let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        topPrefix[i] = topPrefix[i-1] + grid[0][i];
    }

    // Compute prefix sums for the bottom row
    bottomPrefix[0] = grid[1][0];
    for(let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        bottomPrefix[i] = bottomPrefix[i-1] + grid[1][i];
    }

    let result = Infinity;

    // Step 2: Calculate all possible scenario results
    for(let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        const topRemaining = topPrefix[n-1] - topPrefix[j];
        const bottomRemaining = j > 0 ? bottomPrefix[j-1] : 0;
        
        const maxPossible = Math.max(topRemaining, bottomRemaining);
        result = Math.min(result, maxPossible);
    }

    return result;
};

// Example
const grid = [
    [2, 5, 4],
    [1, 5, 1]
];
console.log(gridGame(grid)); // Output: 4
```

## Time Complexity

**Time Complexity:**
- Constructing the prefix sum arrays takes O(n).
- Iterating through each column takes O(n).

Overall, the time complexity is O(n).

**Space Complexity:**
- Use of additional space for prefix arrays which takes O(n).

Overall, the space complexity is O(n).

This solution works within the constraints given by the problem and makes efficient use of prefix sums to minimize redundant calculations.
