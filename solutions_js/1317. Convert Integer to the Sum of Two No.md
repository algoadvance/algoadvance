[Leetcode 1317. Convert Integer to the Sum of Two No](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1317)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`. No-Zero integer is a positive integer that doesn't contain any `0` in its decimal representation.
Return a list of two integers `[A, B]` where:
- `A` and `B` are No-Zero integers.
- `A + B == n`

There may be multiple valid answers, you can return any of them.

Example:
```
Input: n = 11
Output: [2, 9]

Input: n = 10000
Output: [1, 9999]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of `n`? 
    - This is typically not specified but we should assume it fits within standard integer ranges.
2. Are we allowed to choose any valid pair `[A, B]` as long as they satisfy the conditions?
    - Yes, any valid pair is acceptable.
3. Does the integer need to be strictly positive?
    - Yes, since we are dealing with positive integers that don't contain 0.

## Strategy

1. **Iteration and Checking**:
    - Iterate through possible integers `A` starting from 1 upwards.
    - Calculate `B` as `n - A`.
    - For each value of `A` and `B`, check if both numbers are No-Zero integers.
    
2. **No-Zero Check Function**:
    - Write a helper function `isNoZeroInteger` that takes an integer and returns true if it contains no zeros when represented as a string.

## Code

```javascript
function getNoZeroIntegers(n) {
    // Helper function to check if the number is a No-Zero Integer
    function isNoZeroInteger(num) {
        return !num.toString().includes('0');
    }
  
    // Iterate through possible values of A
    for (let A = 1; A < n; A++) {
        let B = n - A;
        if (isNoZeroInteger(A) && isNoZeroInteger(B)) {
            return [A, B];
        }
    }
}

// Example usage
console.log(getNoZeroIntegers(11)); // Output: [2, 9] or any valid pair
console.log(getNoZeroIntegers(10000)); // Output: [1, 9999] or any valid pair
```

## Explanation

1. **Helper Function**:
   - `isNoZeroInteger`: converts the integer to a string and checks if it contains the character '0'.

2. **Iteration**:
   - Loop through `A` from 1 to `n-1`.
   - Calculate `B` as `n - A`.
   - Check if both `A` and `B` are No-Zero integers.
   - If true, return the pair `[A, B]`.

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity is O(n * k) where `k` is the time it takes to check for zeros in the integer (which involves converting to string and checking for a '0' character).
- In general, this is efficient for reasonably small values of `n`, though for very large `n`, this can be optimized further if needed.
