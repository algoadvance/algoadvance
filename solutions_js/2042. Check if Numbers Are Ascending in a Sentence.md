[Leetcode 2042. Check if Numbers Are Ascending in a Sentence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2042)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting of words and numbers separated by spaces. Each word contains only lowercase English letters, and each number is a **positive** number. 

You need to check if the numbers in `s` are **strictly** increasing from left to right and return `true` if they are, otherwise return `false`.

Example:
```
Input: s = "1 box has 3 blue 4 red 6 green and 7 yellow marbles"
Output: true
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Are numbers in `s` going to be valid positive integers without leading zeroes?**
   - Yes, the problem guarantees that the numbers are positive.

2. **Should we ignore any non-numeric text in the string `s`?**
   - Yes, we only need to focus on the numeric values and their order.

3. **Are the numbers always separated by spaces?**
   - Yes, the problem states that words and numbers are separated by spaces.

### Strategy

1. Split the string `s` by spaces to obtain individual words and numbers.
2. Iterate through the resulting list, and filter out only numeric values.
3. Compare the numeric values to ensure they are strictly increasing.

### Code

```javascript
function areNumbersAscending(s) {
    // Split the string by spaces to separate words and numbers
    let tokens = s.split(' ');
    
    // Initialize previous number to a very small number to compare to the first number
    let prevNumber = -Infinity;
    
    for (let token of tokens) {
        // Attempt to parse the token as a number
        let number = parseInt(token);
        
        // If the token is a valid number
        if (!isNaN(number)) {
            // Check if the current number is greater than the previous number
            if (number <= prevNumber) {
                return false;
            }
            // Update previous number to current number
            prevNumber = number;
        }
    }
    
    // If no violations found, return true
    return true;
}

// Example Usage
console.log(areNumbersAscending("1 box has 3 blue 4 red 6 green and 7 yellow marbles")); // true
console.log(areNumbersAscending("hello world 5 x 5")); // false
console.log(areNumbersAscending("sunny and 3 kittens 4 cats")); // true
console.log(areNumbersAscending("4 big 4 small boats")); // false
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of characters in string `s`. 
  - Splitting the string and parsing each token are linear operations.
  
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), for storing the list of tokens after splitting the string.

This solution efficiently checks the order of numeric values in the given sentence.
