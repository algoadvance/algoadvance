[Leetcode 1563. Stone Game V](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1563)
### Problem Statement

Alice and Bob continue their games with stones. A total of `n` stones are arranged in a row. Each stone has an associated value which is an integer given in the array `stoneValue`.

- Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first.
- On each player's turn, the player can divide the array of stones into two non-empty parts: left and right. The score of this step is the sum of values of the stones in the smaller of these two parts. The player who cannot make a move loses the game.
- Both players will use optimal strategies to maximize their scores.

Return the maximum score Alice can obtain if both players play optimally.

**Example:**
```
Input: stoneValue = [6,2,3,4,5,5]
Output: 18
Explanation: Both players start out with [6, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5] and can divide it in various ways:
If Alice splits first:
    - Division [6, 2, 3] and [4, 5, 5] -> smaller part is [6, 2, 3] (sum = 11).
    - Division [6, 2, 3, 4] and [5, 5] -> smaller part is [5, 5] (sum = 10).
    - Division [6, 2] and [3, 4, 5, 5] -> smaller part is [6, 2] (sum = 8).
Alice will choose division yielding maximum score.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the stone values be negative?**
   - No, it is assumed that stone values are positive integers.
   
2. **Do we return the total score Alice can collect only, or after including the played optimal strategy of Bob?**
   - The total score Alice can collect if she and Bob both play optimally.

3. **Do we need to consider memory constraints?**
   - Yes, but typically for such problems, we can use O(n^2) space for the dynamic programming table.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} stoneValue
 * @return {number}
 */
var stoneGameV = function(stoneValue) {
    const n = stoneValue.length;
    
    // Create prefix sum array to get sum of subarrays quickly
    const prefixSum = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        prefixSum[i + 1] = prefixSum[i] + stoneValue[i];
    }
    
    // dp[i][j] means maximum score Alice can obtain from stoneValue[i:j+1]
    const dp = Array.from({ length: n }, () => new Array(n).fill(0));
    
    for (let length = 2; length <= n; length++) {
        for (let i = 0; i + length <= n; i++) {
            const j = i + length - 1;
            for (let k = i; k < j; k++) {
                const leftSum = prefixSum[k + 1] - prefixSum[i];
                const rightSum = prefixSum[j + 1] - prefixSum[k + 1];
                
                if (leftSum < rightSum) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], leftSum + dp[i][k]);
                } else if (leftSum > rightSum) {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], rightSum + dp[k + 1][j]);
                } else {
                    dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i][j], leftSum + Math.max(dp[i][k], dp[k + 1][j]));
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[0][n-1];
};
```

### Strategy

1. **Prefix Sum Array**: First, create a prefix sum array to quickly calculate the sum of any subarray `stoneValue[i:j+1]`.
2. **Dynamic Programming Table**: Use a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` will store the maximum score that Alice can obtain from the subarray `stoneValue[i:j+1]`.
3. **Compute Scores**:
    - The length of the segment starts from `2` to `n`.
    - For each segment `stoneValue[i:j+1]`, try all possible divisions and choose the maximum score that can Alice get.
4. **Choose the Best Split**: For each possible split, calculate the scores from the left and right subarrays; update the dp table based on the optimal strategy.

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this approach is `O(n^3)`. We have three nested loops:
  - First loop iterates over segment lengths (from 2 to n).
  - Second loop iterates over starting points of the segments.
  - Third loop tries all possible splits within the selected subarray.
- The space complexity is `O(n^2)` for storing the dynamic programming table.
