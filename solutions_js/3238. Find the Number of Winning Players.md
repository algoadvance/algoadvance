[Leetcode 3238. Find the Number of Winning Players](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3238)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `scores[]` and an integer `k`. Each element in `scores` represents the score of a player in a game. A player is considered a "winning player" if their score is strictly higher than the k-th largest unique score in the array. You need to find the number of winning players.

### Example

```plaintext
Input: scores = [100, 90, 90, 80, 75, 60], k = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: The unique scores in the array are [100, 90, 80, 75, 60]. The 3rd largest unique score is 80. 
            Players with scores 100, 90, and 90 are winning players.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. What is the range of possible values for `scores` and `k`?
   - Scores can be any integer value.
   - Assume `k` is a valid index (1-based) and will always be less than or equal to the number of unique scores.

2. Can the scores array be empty?
   - No, the array will contain at least one element.

3. Are scores guaranteed to be integers?
   - Yes.

## Strategy

1. **Extract Unique Scores**: Use a Set to get the unique scores from the input array.
2. **Sort Unique Scores**: Convert the Set back to an array and sort it in descending order.
3. **Identify k-th Largest Unique Score**: Fetch the k-th largest unique score from the sorted array.
4. **Count Winning Players**: Iterate through the original scores array to count the number of players who have scores strictly higher than the k-th largest unique score.

## Code

```javascript
function findWinningPlayers(scores, k) {
    // Step 1: Extract unique scores
    let uniqueScores = Array.from(new Set(scores));
    
    // Step 2: Sort unique scores in descending order
    uniqueScores.sort((a, b) => b - a);
    
    // Step 3: Identify the k-th largest unique score
    let kthLargestUniqueScore = uniqueScores[k - 1];
    
    // Step 4: Count the number of winning players
    let winningPlayersCount = 0;
    for (let score of scores) {
        if (score > kthLargestUniqueScore) {
            winningPlayersCount++;
        }
    }
    
    return winningPlayersCount;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(findWinningPlayers([100, 90, 90, 80, 75, 60], 3));  // Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Extracting Unique Scores**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in `scores`.
2. **Sorting Unique Scores**: O(u log u), where u is the number of unique elements in `scores`.
3. **Counting Winning Players**: O(n), where n is the number of elements in `scores`.

Overall, the time complexity of the solution is **O(n + u log u)**, which is efficient given the problem constraints.
