[Leetcode 5. Longest Palindromic Substring](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l5)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return the longest palindromic substring in `s`. 

A palindrome is defined as a sequence that reads the same backward as forward.

### Example
**Input:** "babad"  
**Output:** "bab" or "aba"

**Input:** "cbbd"  
**Output:** "bb"

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What should we return if there are multiple palindromic substrings of the same maximum length?
   - **A:** You can return any one of them.

2. **Q:** How should we handle strings of length 1 or empty strings?
   - **A:** A string of length 1 is itself a palindrome. An empty string should return an empty result.

3. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the length of the input string?
   - **A:** The length of the string `s` will be in the range [0, 1000].

## Strategy

We can solve this problem using a dynamic programming approach or a center-expansion technique. The center-expansion technique is often found to be more space efficient and easier to implement. Hereâ€™s how we can use this technique:

1. For each character in the string, consider it as the center of a potential palindrome.
2. Expand outward from the center while the substring remains a palindrome.
3. Keep track of the longest palindrome found during these expansions.

To handle both odd-length and even-length palindromes:
- For odd-length palindromes, consider each character as the center.
- For even-length palindromes, consider each pair of consecutive characters as the center.

## Code

```javascript
function longestPalindrome(s) {
    if (s == null || s.length < 1) return "";
    
    let start = 0, end = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        let len1 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i); // Odd length palindromes
        let len2 = expandAroundCenter(s, i, i + 1); // Even length palindromes
        let len = Math.max(len1, len2);
        
        if (len > end - start) {
            start = i - Math.floor((len - 1) / 2);
            end = i + Math.floor(len / 2);
        }
    }
    
    return s.substring(start, end + 1);
}

function expandAroundCenter(s, left, right) {
    while (left >= 0 && right < s.length && s.charAt(left) == s.charAt(right)) {
        left--;
        right++;
    }
    return right - left - 1;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity is `O(n^2)`, where `n` is the length of the string. This is because we are processing each character and expanding around each character.
- The space complexity is `O(1)`, as we just use a few variables for intermediate calculations and no extra space proportional to the input size.
