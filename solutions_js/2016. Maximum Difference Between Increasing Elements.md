[Leetcode 2016. Maximum Difference Between Increasing Elements](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2016)
### Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of size `n`. The **maximum difference** of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is defined as `nums[j] - nums[i]`, where `0 <= i < j < n` and `nums[i] < nums[j]`. You need to return the **maximum difference**. If no such `i` and `j` exist, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Will the input array always have at least 2 elements?**
   - A: According to the problem constraints, `n` will be at least 2.

2. **Q: Can the array contain negative numbers and zeros?**
   - A: Yes, any integer values are allowed in the array.

3. **Q: Should we handle cases where the array is strictly decreasing?**
   - A: Yes, if there are no elements `nums[i] < nums[j]` such that `i < j`, we should return `-1`.

### Strategy

To find the maximum difference between an increasing pair in the array:

1. Iterate through the array while keeping track of the minimum element encountered so far.
2. For each element `nums[j]`, calculate the difference `nums[j] - min_element` where `min_element` is the smallest number found before `nums[j]`.
3. Update the maximum difference if `nums[j] - min_element` is larger than the current maximum difference.
4. Update `min_element` as you traverse through the array.
5. If no valid pair is found, return `-1`.

### Code

```javascript
function maximumDifference(nums) {
    let min_element = nums[0];
    let max_diff = -1;

    for (let j = 1; j < nums.length; j++) {
        if (nums[j] > min_element) {
            max_diff = Math.max(max_diff, nums[j] - min_element);
        } else {
            min_element = nums[j];
        }
    }

    return max_diff;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(maximumDifference([7, 1, 5, 4])); // Should print 4
console.log(maximumDifference([9, 4, 3, 2])); // Should print -1
console.log(maximumDifference([1, 5, 2, 10])); // Should print 9
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`. We pass through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), as we are using a fixed amount of extra space (`min_element` and `max_diff`).

This solution efficiently finds the maximum difference by traversing the array in a single pass while keeping track of the minimum value seen so far.
