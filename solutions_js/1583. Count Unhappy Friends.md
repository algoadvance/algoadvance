[Leetcode 1583. Count Unhappy Friends](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1583)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of `n` friends, identifiers from `0` to `n-1`. You are also given the preferences of each friend as a 2D integer list `preferences` where `preferences[i]` is a list of friends in the order of friend `i`'s preference. Friends in each preference list are ordered from most preferred to least preferred in descending order. All friends in the preference list are unique.

You are also given a 2D integer list `pairs`, where `pairs[i]` = `[x, y]` indicates that friend `x` and friend `y` are paired up in the game "Spring Festival." The pairing is not necessarily mutual, i.e., it's possible that the pair `[x, y]` is the same as the pair `[y, x]`.

A friend `x` is unhappy if there exists a friend `u` who is paired with a friend `v` and both `x` prefers `u` over `y` and `u` prefers `x` over `v`, where `[x, y]` is the pair of `x`.

Return the number of unhappy friends.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Does the preference list include all other friends for each friend?**
   - Yes, each friend's preference list includes all other friends and is unique.
   
2. **Are pairs unique such that `[x, y]` and `[y, x]` refer to the same pairing?**
   - Yes, each pair is unique in that way.

3. **What is the maximum value of `n`?**
   - It can be reasonably assumed that `n` will fit within typical competitive programming constraints, such as `n <= 200`.

### Strategy

1. **Convert Preferences to Order Maps:**
   - Construct a mapping for each friend that gives a quick lookup to determine preference order.
   
2. **Track Pairings:**
   - Create a reverse map from pairs for quick lookup.
   
3. **Evaluate Unhappiness:**
   - For each pair, check if either friend is unhappy according to the given conditions.
   
4. **Nested Iteration for Comparison:**
   - Use nested loops to compare each pair with other pairs for evaluating unhappiness condition.

### Code

```javascript
var unhappyFriends = function(n, preferences, pairs) {
    let order = Array.from({length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(0));
    let pairMap = new Map();

    // Build the order map from preferences
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < preferences[i].length; j++) {
            order[i][preferences[i][j]] = j;
        }
    }

    // Build pair map for easy access
    pairs.forEach(([x, y]) => {
        pairMap.set(x, y);
        pairMap.set(y, x);
    });

    let unhappyCount = 0;

    // Iterate through all pairs and check the unhappiness condition
    for (let [x, y] of pairs) {
        for (let u of preferences[x]) {
            if (u === y) break; // Skip if the preference is for the current pair
            let v = pairMap.get(u); // u's partner
            if (order[u][x] < order[u][v]) {
                unhappyCount++;
                break;
            }
        }
        for (let v of preferences[y]) {
            if (v === x) break;
            let u = pairMap.get(v); // v's partner
            if (order[v][y] < order[v][u]) {
                unhappyCount++;
                break;
            }
        }
    }

    return unhappyCount;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Preference Parsing:** \(O(n^2)\) — Construct the order map from preferences.
- **Pair Mapping:** \(O(n)\) — Build the pair mapping for quick look-up.
- **Unhappiness Evaluation:** \(O(n^2)\) — In the worst case, evaluate each friend against all other pairs.

Overall, the time complexity is \(O(n^2)\), which should be efficient given the constraints.
