[Leetcode 1034. Coloring A Border](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1034)
## Problem Statement:

You are given a 2D grid of integers, a `row` and `col` representing the starting cell, and an integer `color`. The grid represents a map of colored regions, and `grid[row][col]` is the color of the starting cell.

The task is to color all cells in the connected component that contains the starting cell with the given color, and to color the border cells of this component with that color. A cell is part of the connected component if it has the same color as the starting cell and it is adjacent to another cell in this component.

A border cell is defined as a cell that:
1. Is on the boundary of the grid, or
2. Has at least one neighboring cell in a different color in the 4-directionally connected neighboring cells (up, down, left, right).

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Can we assume that the input grid will not be empty and will always be a valid rectangular grid?
2. How do we handle diagonal cells? They should not be considered as adjacent cells, right?
3. Can the `color` be the same as the original color of the cell? If so, should we leave the grid intact?

## Strategy:

1. **Initialization**:
   - First, get the color of the starting cell.
   - If the new color is the same as the current color of the starting cell, there is no need to change the grid.

2. **Traversal**:
   - Perform a depth-first search (DFS) or breadth-first search (BFS) to traverse all the cells in the connected component.
   - Keep a record of all visited cells to avoid reprocessing.

3. **Identify Border Cells**:
   - During the traversal, determine if a cell is a border cell:
     - It is on the grid boundary.
     - It has neighboring cells that are not part of the connected component.

4. **Coloring**:
   - After identifying all border cells, update their color.

## Code:

```javascript
function colorBorder(grid, row, col, color) {
    const originalColor = grid[row][col];
    if (originalColor === color) return grid;

    const rows = grid.length;
    const cols = grid[0].length;

    const directions = [
        [0, 1], [1, 0], [0, -1], [-1, 0]
    ];

    const isBorder = (r, c) => {
        if (r === 0 || r === rows - 1 || c === 0 || c === cols - 1) return true;
        for (let [dr, dc] of directions) {
            const nr = r + dr, nc = c + dc;
            if (nr < 0 || nc < 0 || nr >= rows || nc >= cols || grid[nr][nc] !== originalColor) {
                return true;
            }
        }
        return false;
    };

    const visited = Array.from({ length: rows }, () => Array(cols).fill(false));
    const borders = [];

    const dfs = (r, c) => {
        visited[r][c] = true;
        let isCurrentBorder = isBorder(r, c);

        for (let [dr, dc] of directions) {
            const nr = r + dr, nc = c + dc;
            if (nr >= 0 && nc >= 0 && nr < rows && nc < cols && !visited[nr][nc] && grid[nr][nc] === originalColor) {
                if (dfs(nr, nc)) {
                    isCurrentBorder = true;
                }
            }
        }

        if (isCurrentBorder) {
            borders.push([r, c]);
        }

        return isCurrentBorder;
    };

    dfs(row, col);

    for (let [r, c] of borders) {
        grid[r][c] = color;
    }

    return grid;
}
```

## Time Complexity:

- The time complexity is \(O(n \times m)\), where \(n\) is the number of rows and \(m\) is the number of columns. This is because, in the worst case, every cell of the grid is processed once during DFS.
- Space complexity is also \(O(n \times m)\) due to the additional storage for the `visited` array and the recursion stack during DFS.
