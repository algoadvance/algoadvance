[Leetcode 2087. Minimum Cost Homecoming of a Robot in a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2087)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D grid of size `m x n` and two integers `startPos` (a 2-element array representing the starting position of the robot) and `homePos` (a 2-element array representing the target home position of the robot). The robot needs to move from the start position to the home position. Each move costs some amount of energy, which is given as arrays `rowCosts` and `colCosts`.

- `rowCosts[i]` is the cost to move to any cell in row `i`.
- `colCosts[j]` is the cost to move to any cell in column `j`.

You need to calculate the minimum total cost (energy) for the robot to return home.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Movement Constraints**:
   - Can the robot move only vertically and horizontally, or diagonally as well?
   
   **Answer**: The robot can move only vertically or horizontally (canonical grid movement).

2. **Cost Calculation**:
   - Is the cost incurred when entering a new cell or when leaving the current cell?
   
   **Answer**: The cost is incurred when entering a new cell.

3. **Input Size**:
   - What are the constraints on the sizes of the grid and the costs array?
   
   **Answer**: Typically, the grid dimensions `m` and `n`, and the arrays for costs will be reasonably sized for practical computations (like within 10^4), but clarifying specific problem constraints from the prompt or discussion would be necessary.
   
4. **Special Cases**:
   - What if `startPos` is the same as `homePos`?
   
   **Answer**: If `startPos` is the same as `homePos`, the cost should be zero as no movement is needed.

### Strategy

1. **Movement Calculation**:
   - If `startPos` and `homePos` are the same, return `0`.
   - Otherwise, calculate the cost to move from `startPos` to `homePos` step-by-step:
     - Move horizontally first or vertically first, accumulating the respective costs.
   
2. **Cost Accumulation**:
   - Iterate through each intermediate row and column between `startPos` and `homePos` to accumulate the costs using `rowCosts` and `colCosts`.

### Code

```javascript
function minCost(startPos, homePos, rowCosts, colCosts) {
    let totalCost = 0;
    
    let [startRow, startCol] = startPos;
    let [homeRow, homeCol] = homePos;
    
    // Move vertically
    if (homeRow > startRow) {
        for (let row = startRow + 1; row <= homeRow; row++) {
            totalCost += rowCosts[row];
        }
    } else {
        for (let row = startRow - 1; row >= homeRow; row--) {
            totalCost += rowCosts[row];
        }
    }
    
    // Move horizontally
    if (homeCol > startCol) {
        for (let col = startCol + 1; col <= homeCol; col++) {
            totalCost += colCosts[col];
        }
    } else {
        for (let col = startCol - 1; col >= homeCol; col--) {
            totalCost += colCosts[col];
        }
    }
    
    return totalCost;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Vertical Movement**: O(Δm) where Δm is the absolute difference between start and end row indices.
- **Horizontal Movement**: O(Δn) where Δn is the absolute difference between start and end column indices.
- Overall, the time complexity is **O(Δm + Δn)** which is efficient for the given problem constraints.
