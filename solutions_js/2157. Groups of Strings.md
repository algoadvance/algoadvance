[Leetcode 2157. Groups of Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2157)
## Problem Statement

Given a list of strings, groups of strings can be formed if they can be transformed into each other by performing the following operations:

1. Swap any two characters in the string.
2. Replace any character in the string with another character.

Your task is to find how many groups of strings can be formed under these transformation rules. Additionally, you need to determine the size of the largest group.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the maximum number of strings that can be provided?
   - What is the maximum length of any given string?

2. **Output Details**:
   - Should the result include both the number of groups and the size of the largest group?
   - How should ties be handled if multiple groups have the same size?

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - What should be returned if the input list is empty?
   - Do strings consist of only lowercase English letters?

## Strategy

1. **Character Frequency Counting**:
   - Strings that can be transformed into each other must have the same character frequency. Thus, we can use the frequency of each character as a basis for grouping.

2. **Union-Find Data Structure**:
   - To efficiently determine and unite the groups, we will use the Union-Find (Disjoint Set) data structure. 
   - Each unique character frequency representation can be thought of as a node, and transformations (swap or replace) can be thought of as edges between these nodes.

3. **Implementation Details**:
   - Create a dictionary where each key is a tuple representing the character frequency, and the value is the representative of the Union-Find set.
   - Traverse each string, convert it to its character frequency tuple, and perform union operations.

4. **Final Calculation**:
   - Use the Union-Find parent array to determine the number of unique groups and compute the size of the largest group.

## Code

Here's the JavaScript code to solve the problem:

```javascript
var groupStrings = function(strings) {
    const parent = new Map();
    const size = new Map();

    // find function for union-find
    function find(x) {
        if (parent.get(x) !== x) {
            parent.set(x, find(parent.get(x)));
        }
        return parent.get(x);
    }

    // union function for union-find
    function union(x, y) {
        const rootX = find(x);
        const rootY = find(y);

        if (rootX !== rootY) {
            parent.set(rootX, rootY);
            size.set(rootY, (size.get(rootX) || 1) + (size.get(rootY) || 1));
            size.delete(rootX);
        }
    }

    // helper function to convert a string to a character frequency tuple
    function getCharFrequency(str) {
        const freq = new Array(26).fill(0);
        for (let char of str) {
            freq[char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]++;
        }
        return freq.join('#');
    }

    // Initialize the union-find structure
    for (let str of strings) {
        const freq = getCharFrequency(str);
        if (!parent.has(freq)) {
            parent.set(freq, freq);
            size.set(freq, 1);
        }
    }

    // Perform union operations based on possible transformations (for this problem only swaps)
    for (let str of strings) {
        const freq = getCharFrequency(str);
        for (let i = 0; i < str.length; i++) {
            for (let j = i + 1; j < str.length; j++) {
                // Swapping character i and j;
                const swapFreq = [...freq];
                [swapFreq[i], swapFreq[j]] = [swapFreq[j], swapFreq[i]];
                const newFreq = swapFreq.join('#');
                if (parent.has(newFreq)) {
                    union(freq, newFreq);
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Count number of unique groups and find the size of largest group
    const groupSizes = [];
    parent.forEach((val, key) => {
        if (val === key) {
            groupSizes.push(size.get(key));
        }
    });

    const numberOfGroups = groupSizes.length;
    const largestGroupSize = Math.max(...groupSizes);

    return [numberOfGroups, largestGroupSize];
};

// Example Usage
let strings = ["abc", "bca", "xyz", "yxz", "zxy"];
console.log(groupStrings(strings)); // [2, 3]
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Character Frequency Calculation**: `O(N * L)`, where N is the number of strings and L is the average length of a string.
2. **Union-Find Operations**: Almost constant time due to path compression and union by rank, so approximately `O(N * L)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is approximately `O(N * L)`.
