[Leetcode 1481. Least Number of Unique Integers after K Removals](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1481)
## Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `arr` and an integer `k`, remove exactly `k` elements from the array such that the number of unique integers in the array is minimized. Return the least number of unique integers in the array after removing k elements.

### Example:
**Input:**

- `arr = [5, 5, 4]`
- `k = 1`

**Output:**
- `1`

**Explanation:**
- Remove one of the '5' -> [5, 4], which has exactly 1 unique number (5 and 4).

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be the approach if there are multiple elements having the same frequency?**
   - We should focus on removing the least frequent elements first.
  
2. **Is the order of elements relevant?**
   - No, the order is not relevant. We only care about the count of unique integers after removals.

3. **What if `k` is larger than the length of the array?**
   - It is guaranteed `k` is less than or equal to the length of the array.

## Strategy
1. **Count Frequencies:** Use a frequency map to count the occurrences of each integer in the array.
2. **Sort by Frequency:** Sort the unique integers by their frequency in ascending order.
3. **Remove Elements:** Remove the elements starting from the least frequent until we have removed `k` elements.
4. **Count Unique Elements:** Count the remaining unique elements in the array.

Here's the step-by-step solution:

## Code

```javascript
function findLeastNumOfUniqueInts(arr, k) {
    const frequencyMap = new Map();

    // Step 1: Count the frequency of each element
    for (const num of arr) {
        frequencyMap.set(num, (frequencyMap.get(num) || 0) + 1);
    }
    
    // Step 2: Create an array of [num, frequency] and sort by frequency
    const freqArray = Array.from(frequencyMap.entries()).sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1]);
    
    let uniqueCount = freqArray.length;
    
    // Step 3: Remove elements starting from the least frequent
    for (const [num, freq] of freqArray) {
        if (k >= freq) {
            k -= freq;
            uniqueCount--;
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }

    return uniqueCount;
}

// Example Usage
const arr = [5, 5, 4];
const k = 1;
console.log(findLeastNumOfUniqueInts(arr, k)); // Output: 1
```

## Time Complexity
- **Step 1 (Count Frequencies):** This involves a single pass through the array, so it takes `O(n)`.
- **Step 2 (Sort by Frequency):** Sorting the array of unique element frequencies takes `O(m log m)`, where `m` is the number of unique elements.
- **Step 3 (Remove Elements):** This involves iterating over the sorted frequency array, at most `O(m)` times.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n + m log m)`, where `n` is the length of the original array and `m` is the number of unique elements. The space complexity is `O(n)` for storing the frequency map.
