[Leetcode 872. Leaf](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l872)
## Problem Statement

Consider all the leaves of a binary tree. From left to right order, the values of those leaves form a *leaf value sequence*.

Two binary trees are considered *leaf-similar* if their leaf value sequence is the same.

Return `true` if and only if the two given trees with head nodes `root1` and `root2` are leaf-similar.

A binary tree node is defined as:
```javascript
function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
    this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
    this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left);
    this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right);
}
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the trees be empty?
   - Yes, if both trees are empty, they are trivially leaf-similar.

2. What is the expected output if one tree is empty and the other is not?
   - They are not leaf-similar, so the output should be `false`.

3. Is there any constraint on the number of nodes in the trees?
   - No specific constraint mentioned, so consider the typical constraints found in binary tree problems. Usually, this can be in the range of thousands.

## Strategy

1. **Extract the Leaves**: Write a helper function that traverses the tree and collects the leaf nodes.
   - Using Depth-First Search (DFS) is straightforward.
   - Traverse until you find a leaf node (node with no left or right children) and add its value to a list.
   
2. **Compare the Leaves**: Collect the leaves of both trees and check if the resulting lists are identical.

## Code

```javascript
function getLeafValues(root) {
    const leaves = [];
    
    function dfs(node) {
        if (!node) return;
      
        if (!node.left && !node.right) {
            leaves.push(node.val);
        }
        
        dfs(node.left);
        dfs(node.right);
    }
    
    dfs(root);
    return leaves;
}

function leafSimilar(root1, root2) {
    const leaves1 = getLeafValues(root1);
    const leaves2 = getLeafValues(root2);
  
    // Compare the two leaf sequences
    if (leaves1.length !== leaves2.length) return false;
  
    for (let i = 0; i < leaves1.length; i++) {
        if (leaves1[i] !== leaves2[i]) return false;
    }
  
    return true;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time complexity**: O(N) for each tree, where N is the number of nodes in the tree.
  - We are traversing each node of the tree exactly once to collect the leaves.
- **Space complexity**: O(H) for each tree, where H is the height of the tree (due to the recursive call stack), plus O(L) for storing the leaf values, where L is the number of leaves.
  - In the worst case for balanced trees, H is O(log N). In the worst case for skewed trees, H is O(N).
  - The leaf values array will at most have N/2 leaf nodes in a balanced tree, so O(N) in the worst case for space to store leaves.

This solution will efficiently determine if the two binary trees are leaf-similar.
