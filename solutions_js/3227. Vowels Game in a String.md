[Leetcode 3227. Vowels Game in a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3227)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string `s`. The game consists of picking the longest substring containing more vowels than consonants. If there are multiple substrings with the same length, return the one which appears first in the string. 

Vowels in the English alphabet are 'a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u' (both lowercase and uppercase).

### Example

```plaintext
Input: s = "abciiidef"
Output: "iii"
Explanation: The longest substring with more vowels than consonants is "iii".
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the string contain non-alphabet characters?**
   For simplicity, let's assume the string only contains English letters.

2. **Is the input string case-sensitive?**
   Yes, the function should treat uppercase and lowercase letters differently.

3. **Is it guaranteed to have at least one vowel in the string?**
   No, it's possible that there are no vowels in the string.

## Strategy

To solve this problem:
1. Traverse through the string while keeping track of the current substring that contains more vowels.
2. Use a sliding window approach to find all possible substrings, updating the counter for vowels and consonants dynamically:
   - If a substring has more vowels than consonants, compare its length with the longest valid substring found so far and update accordingly.
   
Given that the range of English alphabetics is small, a direct iteration approach should suffice without complex optimization.

## Code

```javascript
function isVowel(char) {
    return 'aeiouAEIOU'.includes(char);
}

function longestVowelMoreSubstr(s) {
    let maxLength = 0;
    let startIndex = 0;
    let currentStart = 0;
    let vowelsCount = 0;
    let consonantsCount = 0;

    for (let end = 0; end < s.length; end++) {
        if (isVowel(s[end])) {
            vowelsCount++;
        } else {
            consonantsCount++;
        }

        while (vowelsCount <= consonantsCount && currentStart < end) {
            if (isVowel(s[currentStart])) {
                vowelsCount--;
            } else {
                consonantsCount--;
            }
            currentStart++;
        }

        if (vowelsCount > consonantsCount && (end - currentStart + 1) > maxLength) {
            maxLength = end - currentStart + 1;
            startIndex = currentStart;
        }
    }

    return maxLength > 0 ? s.substring(startIndex, startIndex + maxLength) : "";
}

// Example usage:
console.log(longestVowelMoreSubstr("abciiidef"));  // Output: "iii"
```

## Time Complexity

**Time Complexity:** O(N)
- We traverse the string with a sliding window which results in linear time complexity.

**Space Complexity:** O(1)
- The space usage is minimal as we only use a few integer variables for counting and indices.
