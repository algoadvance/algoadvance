[Leetcode 2397. Maximum Rows Covered by Columns](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2397)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed m x n binary matrix `matrix` and an integer `cols`. The matrix represents a campaign map. Each cell in the matrix contains either a 0 or a 1. A row is said to be "covered" if all the cells in the row that contain a 1 are also present in at least one of the chosen columns. 

You need to select exactly `cols` columns from the `n` available columns such that the number of rows covered by these columns is maximized. 

Return the maximum number of rows that can be covered by selecting `cols` columns.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on `m`, `n`, and `cols`?**
   - This information is necessary to understand the problem's limits and how optimized the solution needs to be.
   
2. **How are ties resolved if multiple sets of columns cover the same maximum number of rows?**
   - Even if ties were possible, the problem only requires the maximum number of rows covered, so any set of columns that achieves this can be an acceptable solution.

3. **Are the elements in the matrix guaranteed to be either 0 or 1?**
   - Yes, this is guaranteed per the problem statement.

### Strategy

1. **Generate All Combinations of Columns:**
   - Since `cols` columns need to be selected from `n` columns, we can use combinations to generate all possible sets of columns that could be picked.
   
2. **Check Row Coverage:**
   - For each combination of columns, check how many rows are completely covered by the selected columns.
   - A row is considered covered if every `1` in that row is in one of the chosen columns.
   
3. **Count Maximum Rows Covered:**
   - Track the maximum number of rows that can be covered by any combination of columns.

### Code

```javascript
function maxRows(matrix, cols) {
    const m = matrix.length;
    const n = matrix[0].length;
    
    // Helper function to generate all combinations of given `array` choosing `r` elements.
    function* combinations(array, r) {
        const n = array.length;
        if (r > n) return;
        const indices = Array(r).fill(0).map((_, i) => i);
        yield indices.map(i => array[i]);

        while (true) {
            let i;
            for (i = r - 1; i >= 0 && indices[i] === i + n - r; i--);
            if (i < 0) return;

            indices[i]++;
            for (let j = i + 1; j < r; j++) {
                indices[j] = indices[j - 1] + 1;
            }

            yield indices.map(i => array[i]);
        }
    }

    // Function to check if a row is covered by the selected columns
    function isRowCovered(row, selectedCols) {
        for (let col = 0; col < n; col++) {
            if (matrix[row][col] === 1 && !selectedCols.has(col)) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    let maxCoveredRows = 0;

    // Iterate over all combinations of `cols` columns
    for (const combination of combinations([...Array(n).keys()], cols)) {
        const selectedCols = new Set(combination);
        let coveredRows = 0;

        // Check each row if it is covered by the selected columns
        for (let row = 0; row < m; row++) {
            if (isRowCovered(row, selectedCols)) {
                coveredRows++;
            }
        }

        maxCoveredRows = Math.max(maxCoveredRows, coveredRows);
    }

    return maxCoveredRows;
}

// Example usage
let matrix = [
    [1, 0, 0, 1],
    [0, 1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0, 1]
];
let cols = 2;

console.log(maxRows(matrix, cols)); // Output will depend on the specific matrix and cols
```

### Time Complexity

- **Combination Generation:** Generating combinations of `n` columns taken `cols` at a time is \( \binom{n}{cols} \) which is \( O(n^cols) \).
- **Row Coverage Check:** For each combination, checking if a row is covered takes \( O(m \times n) \).

Overall, the time complexity in the worst case can be approximated as \( O(n^cols \times m \times n) \). This emphasizes the importance of constraints on `m`, `n`, and `cols` to ensure the algorithm runs efficiently.
