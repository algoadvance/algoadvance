[Leetcode 917. Reverse Only Letters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l917)
## Problem Statement
You are given a string `s`. Reverse only all the letters in the string and leave all other characters in their original positions.

### Example 1:
```
Input: s = "ab-cd"
Output: "dc-ba"
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: s = "a-bC-dEf-ghIj"
Output: "j-Ih-gfE-dCba"
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: s = "Test1ng-Leet=code-Q!"
Output: "Qedo1ct-eeLg=ntse-T!"
```

### Constraints:
- `1 <= s.length <= 100`
- `s` consists of characters which are either letters or ASCII characters.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What characters should remain unchanged?**
   - Characters that are not letters should remain in their original positions.
   
2. **Can we assume the input string only contains valid characters?**
   - Yes, based on the constraints provided.
   
3. **Are we allowed to use additional data structures?**
   - Yes, but optimal solutions are preferred.

## Strategy
1. Identify all the letters in the string using a two-pointer technique.
2. Use one pointer to iterate from the start and another from the end.
3. When both pointers identify letters, swap them and move the pointers inward.
4. Skip non-letter characters without swapping them.
5. Continue this process until the pointers meet.

## Code
```javascript
function reverseOnlyLetters(s) {
    // Convert string to an array to easily swap elements
    const arr = s.split('');
    let left = 0;
    let right = arr.length - 1;

    // Function to check if a character is a letter
    const isLetter = (ch) => {
        return (ch >= 'a' && ch <= 'z') || (ch >= 'A' && ch <= 'Z');
    };

    while (left < right) {
        // Move the left pointer until we find a letter
        while (left < right && !isLetter(arr[left])) {
            left++;
        }
        // Move the right pointer until we find a letter
        while (left < right && !isLetter(arr[right])) {
            right--;
        }
        // Swap the letters
        if (left < right) {
            let temp = arr[left];
            arr[left] = arr[right];
            arr[right] = temp;
            left++;
            right--;
        }
    }

    // Convert array back to string and return
    return arr.join('');
}
```

## Time Complexity
The solution involves a single pass through the string, which results in `O(n)` time complexity, where `n` is the length of the string. The space complexity is `O(n)` due to the conversion of the string to an array for easier manipulation.
