[Leetcode 3171. Find Subarray With Bitwise OR Closest to K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3171)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. Your task is to find a contiguous subarray such that the bitwise OR of the elements of this subarray is closest to `k`. If there are multiple such subarrays, return any one of them.

### Sample Input
- `nums`: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
- `k`: 7

### Sample Output
- A subarray such as [3, 4] or [2, 4], etc., which achieves the bitwise OR closest to k.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Range of Values**: Are there any constraints on the size of the array (`nums`) and the values within it?
   - Typically, in such problems, array size (`n`) can go up to 10^5, and the values within can be large integers.
   
2. **Multiple Solutions**: If there are multiple subarrays with the same closest bitwise OR to `k`, can we return any one of them?
   - Yes, any one of them is acceptable according to the problem statement.

3. **Negative Integers**: Are we handling negative integers in the array?
   - Typically, bitwise operations are more meaningful for non-negative integers. However, if handling negatives is required, clarification would be necessary.

## Strategy
1. **Bitwise OR**: To understand which subarray's OR is closest to `k`, we need to iterate through all possible subarrays. 
   
2. **Sliding Window**: A sliding window approach or maintaining a running OR can help in calculating the OR of subarrays efficiently.

3. **Store and Compare**: For each subarray OR, compare its difference with `k` and track the subarray that minimizes the absolute difference.

## Code Implementation

```javascript
function findSubarrayClosestToK(nums, k) {
    let n = nums.length;
    let closestOr = -1;
    let minDiff = Infinity;
    let result = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        let currentOr = 0;

        for (let j = i; j < n; ++j) {
            currentOr |= nums[j];

            let currentDiff = Math.abs(currentOr - k);
            if (currentDiff < minDiff) {
                minDiff = currentDiff;
                closestOr = currentOr;
                result = nums.slice(i, j + 1);
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
}

// Example Usage:
let nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
let k = 7;
console.log(findSubarrayClosestToK(nums, k));  // Output: A subarray, e.g., [3, 4]
```

## Time Complexity
- **Overall Complexity**: O(n^2)
  - The outer loop runs `n` times, and for each iteration, the inner loop also runs up to `n` times, leading to a quadratic time complexity O(n^2).

## Space Complexity
- **Overall Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Except for the space used to store the result subarray, no additional space proportional to the input size is used. The result subarray can at most be as long as the input array, leading to an additional space of O(n).
