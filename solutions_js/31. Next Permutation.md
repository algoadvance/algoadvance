[Leetcode 31. Next Permutation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l31)
### Problem Statement
> Implement the `nextPermutation` function that rearranges numbers into the lexicographically next greater permutation of numbers. If such an arrangement is not possible, it must rearrange it as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order). The replacement must be in place and use only constant extra memory.
> 
> **Example 1:**
> ```
> Input: nums = [1,2,3]
> Output: [1,3,2]
> ```
> 
> **Example 2:**
> ```
> Input: nums = [3,2,1]
> Output: [1,2,3]
> ```
> 
> **Example 3:**
> ```
> Input: nums = [1,1,5]
> Output: [1,5,1]
> ```
> 
> **Constraints:**
> - `1 <= nums.length <= 100`
> - `0 <= nums[i] <= 100`
 
### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q: What should be the behavior when the array is already the highest possible permutation?**
   - A: The function should return the array rearranged as the lowest possible order (i.e., sorted in ascending order).

2. **Q: Can I use extra memory to solve this problem?**
   - A: No, the function must use constant extra memory and perform the rearrangement in place.

### Strategy
1. **Identification of a Peak**:
   - Traverse the array from the end to find the first element (`nums[k]`) that is smaller than its next element (`nums[k+1]`). This will be our pivot point.
   - If no such element is found, it means the array is sorted in descending order. In such a case, reversing the whole array will give us the lowest permutation.

2. **Finding the Swap Point**:
   - Traverse the array from the end again to find the first element (`nums[l]`) that is greater than `nums[k]`.

3. **Swapping**:
   - Swap the elements at indices `k` and `l`.

4. **Reversing**:
   - Reverse the sequence from `k + 1` to the end of the array to get the next lexicographical permutation.

### Code
```javascript
function nextPermutation(nums) {
    let len = nums.length;

    if (len <= 1) return;

    // Step 1: Find the first decreasing element from the end
    let k = len - 2;
    while (k >= 0 && nums[k] >= nums[k + 1]) {
        k--;
    }

    if (k >= 0) { // there is a pivot element
        // Step 2: Find the first element larger than nums[k] from the end
        let l = len - 1;
        while (l >= 0 && nums[l] <= nums[k]) {
            l--;
        }
        // Step 3: Swap elements at indices k and l
        [nums[k], nums[l]] = [nums[l], nums[k]];
    }

    // Step 4: Reverse the elements from k + 1 to the end of the array
    let start = k + 1;
    let end = len - 1;
    while (start < end) {
        [nums[start], nums[end]] = [nums[end], nums[start]];
        start++;
        end--;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n) â€” The entire algorithm consists of a few linear scans of the array.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) â€” The operation is performed in place with no extra space other than a few variable storages.
