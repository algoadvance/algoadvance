[Leetcode 957. Prison Cells After N Days](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l957)
### Problem Statement:
There are 8 prison cells in a row, and each cell is either occupied or vacant. Each day, whether the cells change is determined according to the following rules:
- If a cell has two adjacent neighbors that are both occupied or both vacant, then the cell becomes occupied.
- Otherwise, it becomes vacant.

You are given an array `cells` where `cells[i] == 1` if the `i-th` cell is occupied and `cells[i] == 0` if the `i-th` cell is vacant, and you are given an integer `N`.

Return the state of the `cells` after `N` days (and `N` such changes described above).

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: cells = [0,1,0,1,1,0,0,1], N = 7
Output: [0,0,1,1,0,0,0,0]

Input: cells = [1,0,0,1,0,0,1,0], N = 1000000000
Output: [0,0,1,1,1,1,1,0]
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Can `N` be very large (like 10^9)?**
   - Yes, `N` can be a very large number, which means naive simulation for `N` days is not feasible.
2. **Is there any constraint on the number of cells?**
   - Yes, the number of cells is always 8.

### Strategy:
1. **Simulation and Cycle Detection**:
   - Given the size is small (8), and pattern formation potential, we can leverage cycle detection here.
   - We simulate the changes and use a set to record states we have seen before.
   - If we detect a state has reoccurred, it means we've entered a cycle, and we can use this information to skip ahead in time.

2. **Steps**:
   - Initialize a dictionary to remember the state and the day we first observe it.
   - Loop through each day and transform the cells based on the rules.
   - Check if the new state has been seen before:
     - If seen, determine the cycle length and adjust `N` to `N % cycle_length`.
   - Continue the transformations for the reduced number of days.

### Time Complexity:
- **Worst Case**: O(64) for simulating up to 64 unique states, as the number of binary states in 8 cells is 2^6 = 64. This is efficient enough for practical execution, even if `N` is very large.

### Code:
```javascript
var prisonAfterNDays = function(cells, N) {
    let seen = new Map();
    let hasCycle = false;
    let cycleLength = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < N; i++) {
        let next = new Array(8).fill(0);
        for (let j = 1; j < 7; j++) {
            if (cells[j - 1] === cells[j + 1]) {
                next[j] = 1;
            } else {
                next[j] = 0;
            }
        }
        let stateKey = next.join('');
        if (seen.has(stateKey)) {
            cycleLength = i - seen.get(stateKey);
            hasCycle = true;
            break;
        } else {
            seen.set(stateKey, i);
        }
        cells = next;
    }

    if (hasCycle) {
        N = N % cycleLength;
        for (let i = 0; i < N; i++) {
            let next = new Array(8).fill(0);
            for (let j = 1; j < 7; j++) {
                if (cells[j - 1] === cells[j + 1]) {
                    next[j] = 1;
                } else {
                    next[j] = 0;
                }
            }
            cells = next;
        }
    }

    return cells;
};
```

This code efficiently handles the simulation using a cycle detection strategy and can work even if `N` is very large.
