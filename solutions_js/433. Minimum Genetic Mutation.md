[Leetcode 433. Minimum Genetic Mutation](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l433)
## Problem Statement
A gene string can be represented by an 8-character long string, with characters representing one of the four nucleotides 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T'. Given a start gene string, an end gene string, and a bank of valid gene mutations, determine the minimum number of mutations needed to transform the start gene string into the end gene string. A mutation is defined as a single change of one character in the gene string, and each mutated gene string must be in the bank.

If there is no such transformation sequence possible, return -1.

### Example
- **Example 1:**
  - Input: start = "AACCGGTT", end = "AACCGGTA", bank = ["AACCGGTA"]
  - Output: 1

- **Example 2:**
  - Input: start = "AACCGGTT", end = "AACCGGTA", bank = ["AACCGGTA", "AACCGCTA", "AAACGGTA"]
  - Output: 1
  
- **Example 3:**
  - Input: start = "AAAAACCC", end = "AACCCCCC", bank = ["AAAACCCC", "AAACCCCC", "AACCCCCC"]
  - Output: 3

### Constraints
- The start and end string have a length of 8.
- The bank contains valid gene strings all of length 8.
- The start string will not be the same as the end string.
- All strings in the bank are unique.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **What should be returned if the end gene string is not present in the bank?**
   - We should return -1 if the end gene string is not in the bank.
   
2. **Are the inputs always valid or do we need to check for corner cases?**
   - The problem states that the inputs are valid in terms of length, but we should still consider cases where no mutation path is possible.

## Strategy
We can solve this problem using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm:
1. Use a queue to store gene strings and the number of mutations to reach them.
2. Initialize the queue with the start string and 0 mutations.
3. Use a set to keep track of gene strings that are present in the bank.
4. While processing the queue:
   - For each gene string, generate all possible valid mutations that are one character different.
   - If one of these mutations matches the end string, return the mutation count.
   - If a mutation string exists in the bank, add it to the queue and remove it from the set to prevent revisiting.

## Code
```javascript
function minMutation(start, end, bank) {
    const geneLength = 8;
    const choices = ['A', 'C', 'G', 'T'];
    const bankSet = new Set(bank);
    const visited = new Set();
    const queue = [[start, 0]];

    if (!bankSet.has(end)) {
        return -1;
    }

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        let [current, mutations] = queue.shift();

        if (current === end) {
            return mutations;
        }

        for (let i = 0; i < geneLength; i++) {
            for (let choice of choices) {
                if (current[i] !== choice) {
                    let mutatedGene = current.slice(0, i) + choice + current.slice(i + 1);

                    if (bankSet.has(mutatedGene) && !visited.has(mutatedGene)) {
                        visited.add(mutatedGene);
                        queue.push([mutatedGene, mutations + 1]);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return -1;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(N * M), where N is the number of gene strings in the bank and M is the length of the gene string (which is constant, 8). This accounts for traversing the gene bank and generating possible mutations at each step.
