[Leetcode 1024. Video Stitching](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1024)
### Problem Statement

You are given a series of video clips from which you can extract any segment to stitch together to create a desired video. The desired video has a length `T` from `0` to `T-1`. Each video clip is represented as an array where `clips[i] = [start_i, end_i]` meaning the clip starts at time `start_i` and ends at time `end_i`.

Return the minimum number of clips needed to stitch the entire range from `0` to `T-1`. If it is impossible to stitch the video, return `-1`.

#### Example:
- Input: `clips = [[0,2],[4,6],[8,10],[1,9],[1,5],[5,9]], T = 10`
- Output: `3`
- Explanation: 
  - We take clip [0, 2], [1, 9], and [8, 10]. 
  - We stitch them together to make a consistent video of length 10.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **All clips are valid within the range from 0 to T**: Yes.
2. **No clips are overlapping**: Clips can potentially overlap.
3. **It is possible to not be able to stitch the video completely**: Yes, in this case, the function should return `-1`.

### Strategy

1. **Sort the Clips**: First, sort the clips by their starting time. If two clips have the same starting time, sort them by their ending time in descending order.
2. **Greedy Approach**: Use a greedy approach to choose the necessary clips:
   - Initialize variables for `end` and `farthest`.
   - Traverse through the sorted clips to find the farthest-reaching clip at every step.
   - Check if clips can fill the gaps without leaving any part of the section uncovered from `0` to `T-1`.
3. **Count Clips**: Count the minimum number of clips used to cover the entire range.

### Code

```javascript
function videoStitching(clips, T) {
    // Sort clips by starting time. If starting times are the same, sort by ending time in descending order.
    clips.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0] || b[1] - a[1]);

    let end = 0;
    let farthest = 0;
    let count = 0;
    let i = 0;

    while (i < clips.length && end < T) {
        // If there's a gap between clips, return -1
        if (clips[i][0] > end) {
            return -1;
        }

        // Extend the current end to the farthest end reachable by clips starting before or at `end`
        while (i < clips.length && clips[i][0] <= end) {
            farthest = Math.max(farthest, clips[i][1]);
            i++;
        }

        // Move the end to the new farthest point reached
        end = farthest;
        count++;

        // If we've reached or surpassed T, break
        if (end >= T) {
            break;
        }
    }

    return end >= T ? count : -1;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting**: O(n log n) where `n` is the number of clips.
- **Traversal**: O(n) for a single pass through the list of clips.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)** due to the sort operation.

### Explanation

1. **Initial Sort**: The clips are sorted primarily by start time and secondarily by end time in descending order to maximize the extending range.
2. **Greedy Selection**: Track the farthest end encountered so far among clips that start before or exactly at the current `end`.
3. **Counting Updates**: Each iteration updates `end` and increments the count. It stops when the `end` meets or exceeds `T` or if there's a gap which makes it impossible to continue.

The code is designed to efficiently determine the minimum number of video clips required to form a contiguous range from `0` to `T`.
