[Leetcode 1312. Minimum Insertion Steps to Make a String Palindrome](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1312)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`. In one step, you can insert any character at any position of the string.

Return the minimum number of steps to make `s` a palindrome.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is the string case-sensitive?**
   - Yes, the string is case-sensitive.

2. **What are the constraints on the length of the string?**
   - The length of the string will be in the range `[1, 500]`.

3. **Can special characters be part of the string?**
   - Yes, any character can be part of the string.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, we can use dynamic programming. The idea is to find the longest palindromic subsequence (LPS) in the given string `s`. The minimum number of insertions needed to make the string a palindrome is the difference between the length of the string and the length of the LPS.

#### Steps:

1. **Construct the Dynamic Programming Table:**
   - Create a 2D DP array `dp` where `dp[i][j]` represents the length of the longest palindromic subsequence in the substring `s[i:j+1]`.

2. **Fill the DP Table:**
   - If `s[i]` matches `s[j]`, then `dp[i][j] = dp[i+1][j-1] + 1`.
   - Otherwise, `dp[i][j] = max(dp[i+1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.

3. **Result:**
   - The minimum insertions required is `len(s) - dp[0][len(s)-1]`.

### Code

```javascript
function minInsertions(s) {
    const n = s.length;
    const dp = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(0));

    // Base case: a single character is itself a palindrome
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        dp[i][i] = 1;
    }

    // Fill the dp array
    for (let length = 2; length <= n; length++) {
        for (let i = 0; i <= n - length; i++) {
            const j = i + length - 1;
            if (s[i] === s[j]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i + 1][j - 1] + 2;
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = Math.max(dp[i + 1][j], dp[i][j - 1]);
            }
        }
    }

    // The minimum insertions needed to make the whole string a palindrome
    return n - dp[0][n - 1];
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity is `O(n^2)` where `n` is the length of the string. This is because we have a nested loop that iterates over the length of the string.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is also `O(n^2)` due to the 2D DP array used to store intermediate results.

This approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the minimum number of insertions needed to make the string a palindrome using dynamic programming.
