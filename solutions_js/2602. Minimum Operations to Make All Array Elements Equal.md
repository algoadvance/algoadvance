[Leetcode 2602. Minimum Operations to Make All Array Elements Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2602)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. In one operation, you can select an index `i` and either increment or decrement the element `nums[i]` by `k`. Your goal is to make all elements in the array equal using the minimum number of operations.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make all the elements equal.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What are the constraints on the values of `nums` and `k`?
2. Can `k` be zero or negative? 
3. Should we return `-1` if it's impossible to make all elements equal?
4. Are there any specific edge cases we need to consider?

### Code Strategy
To solve this problem, we can break down the operations and use a mathematical approach to understand how to efficiently make all elements equal to a target value. Here's the strategy:

1. **Modulo Operation:** since we can increment or decrement by `k`, itâ€™s useful to consider the equivalence classes modulo `k`. Two numbers can be made equal using only additions and subtractions of `k` if and only if they are congruent modulo `k`.

2. **Target Value:** One logical approach is to make all numbers congruent to each other modulo `k`. From there, any particular value satisfying the congruence can be set as the target.

3. **Calculate Operations:** Once we have a congruence relation, for each number in the array, calculate the steps required to make it equal to the target value. This can be achieved by determining how many increments or decrements of `k` are needed.

### Algorithm
1. **Find the mode:** Calculate the frequency of each value modulo `k`. We should aim to make all numbers congruent to the most frequent value modulo `k`.
2. **Calculate Steps:** For each element, calculate the number of operations needed to make it equal to the target and accumulate the total steps.

### Code Implementation

```javascript
function minOperations(nums, k) {
    let freq = new Map();
    
    // Calculate frequencies of each value % k
    for (let num of nums) {
        let modVal = num % k;
        freq.set(modVal, (freq.get(modVal) || 0) + 1);
    }
    
    // Find the most frequently occurring mod value
    let targetModVal = Array.from(freq).reduce((a, b) => a[1] > b[1] ? a : b)[0];
    
    let operations = 0;
    
    for (let num of nums) {
        let modVal = num % k;
        if (modVal !== targetModVal) {
            // Calculate minimal operations to convert num % k to targetModVal
            let diff = Math.abs(targetModVal - modVal);
            let operationCount = Math.min(diff, k - diff);
            operations += operationCount;
        }
    }
    
    return operations;
}
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of elements in the array. This is because we iterate through the array a constant number of times:

1. First to calculate the frequency of modulo values, which takes `O(n)`.
2. Then to calculate the total operations needed, which also takes `O(n)`.

The space complexity is `O(k)` because of the frequency map which stores at most `k` different keys.

This should efficiently solve the problem for large arrays and is optimized for competitive programming scenarios.
