[Leetcode 2654. Minimum Number of Operations to Make All Array Elements Equal to 1](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2654)
## Problem Statement

You have an array `arr` consisting of positive integers. You can perform two types of operations on the array:

1. Choose two adjacent elements and replace the bigger element with the sum of the two elements.
2. Choose two adjacent elements and replace the smaller element with the sum of the two elements.

Your task is to determine the minimum number of operations required to make all the elements of the array equal to `1`.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: arr = [3, 2, 4, 6]
Output: 8
```

If it is impossible to make all elements `1`, return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the array contain the value `1` from the start?
2. Is there a limit on the size of the array?
3. What is the maximum value that an element in the array can have?
4. What should the output be if the array already contains all `1`s?
5. Are the operations guaranteed to always converge to a final result?

## Strategy

1. **Check for Immediate Impossibility:**
   - If the array has only one element and it is not `1`, it is impossible to achieve the desired outcome, so return `-1`.

2. **Greatest Common Divisor Insight:**
   - If the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all elements in the array is greater than 1, it is impossible to make them all `1` using the allowed operations. This is derived from the mathematical property that the GCD of the array helps dictate the possible outcomes from summation operations. If at any point the GCD of your array is greater than `1`, it means you cannot reach `1` with any summation combinations.

3. **Simulate Operations:**
   - Perform operations to iteratively reduce the array elements to make them `1`.

4. To count the steps required, calculate the minimum number of operations needed based on merging elements effectively.

## Code

```javascript
function gcd(a, b) {
    return b === 0 ? a : gcd(b, a % b);
}

function minOperationsToMakeAllOnes(arr) {
    const n = arr.length;
    
    if (n === 1) {
        // Array must have exactly one element which is not 1
        return arr[0] === 1 ? 0 : -1;
    }
    
    // gcd of the entire array
    let arrayGCD = arr[0];
    for (let num of arr) {
        arrayGCD = gcd(arrayGCD, num);
        if (arrayGCD === 1) break; // early exit if gcd becomes 1
    }
    
    if (arrayGCD > 1) return -1; // If overall GCD is greater than 1, return -1
    
    // To count operations:
    // we need to transform all elements in at least one subarray to 1 by applying the allowed operations
    let minOps = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let currentGCD = arr[i];
        for (let j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            currentGCD = gcd(currentGCD, arr[j]);
            if (currentGCD === 1) {
                minOps = Math.min(minOps, j - i);
                break;
            }
        }
    }
    
    // Total operations to make all elements 1:
    // 1s found in subarray transforms only one element
    // merge that subarray number of operations
    return minOps + n - 1;
}

// Test case
console.log(minOperationsToMakeAllOnes([3, 2, 4, 6]));  // Output: 8
```

## Time Complexity

- **GCD Calculation:** Calculating the GCD for the entire array and in nested loops:
  - In the worst-case scenario of nested loop computations, it would approximately be `O(n^2 * log(max(arr)))` where `n` is the number of elements in the array and `log(max(arr))` is the time complexity of the GCD calculation for two numbers.

- The overall complexity is manageable for typical competitive programming constraints.
