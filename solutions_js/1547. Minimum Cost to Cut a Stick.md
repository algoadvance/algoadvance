[Leetcode 1547. Minimum Cost to Cut a Stick](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1547)
### Problem Statement

You are given a stick with a length `n` and an array `cuts` where `cuts[i]` denotes a position on the stick you must make a cut. You want to minimize the cost of making all the cuts. The cost of making a cut is the length of the stick segment you are cutting. When you make a cut, the stick segment splits into two smaller sticks. Your goal is to find the minimum total cost to make all the cuts.

*Example 1:*

```
Input: n = 7, cuts = [1,3,4,5]
Output: 16
Explanation: Using cuts order [1, 3, 4, 5] or [5, 4, 3, 1], the total cost is the same:
- First cut at position 1 will cost 7 (length of the stick).
- Second cut at position 3 will cost 6 (length of the stick after first cut).
- Third cut at position 4 will cost 4 (length of the stick after second cut).
- Fourth cut at position 5 will cost 3 (length of the stick after third cut).
The total cost is 7 + 6 + 4 + 3 = 20.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the `cuts` guaranteed to be unique?**
   Yes, each cut position is unique.

2. **Does the order of cuts in the output matter?**
   No, the order doesn't matter in the output.

3. **Can `cuts` be an empty array?**
   Yes, `cuts` can be empty, in which case the cost will be zero.

### Strategy

We can solve this problem using dynamic programming (DP). The idea is to consider each segment of the stick and calculate the minimum cost of making all the required cuts within that segment.

1. **Sort the `cuts` array:** This helps in decision-making in a sequential manner.
2. **Define the DP state:** Use a 2D DP array `dp[i][j]` which represents the minimum cost to cut the stick between `cuts[i]` and `cuts[j]`.
3. **Initialize the DP array:** `dp[i][i+1] = 0` where there is no space for cuts, hence no cost.
4. **Fill the DP array:** For each subsegment, compute the cost of making each possible cut and add it to the cost of the two resulting subsegments. Update `dp[i][j]` with the minimum cost.

### Code

Here's the implementation:

```javascript
var minCost = function(n, cuts) {
    cuts.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    cuts = [0, ...cuts, n];
    const len = cuts.length;
    
    // Initialize DP array
    const dp = Array.from({ length: len }, () => Array(len).fill(0));
    
    // Fill DP array
    for (let i = len - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        for (let j = i + 2; j < len; j++) {
            dp[i][j] = Infinity;
            for (let k = i + 1; k < j; k++) {
                dp[i][j] = Math.min(dp[i][j], dp[i][k] + dp[k][j] + cuts[j] - cuts[i]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[0][len - 1];
};

// Example Usage
let n = 7;
let cuts = [1, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(minCost(n, cuts));  // Output: 16
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \(O(m^3)\), where \(m\) is the number of cuts. This is because:
1. Sorting the cuts takes \(O(m \log m)\).
2. Filling the DP array involves three nested loops, each running up to \(m\) times, resulting in \(O(m^3)\) time for the DP solution itself.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is \(O(m^2)\), due to the DP array `dp` of size \(m \times m\).
