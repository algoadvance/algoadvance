[Leetcode 1706. Where Will the Ball Fall](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1706)
### Problem Statement

You have a 2-D `grid` of size `m x n` representing a box, and you have `n` balls. The box is open on the top and bottom sides.

Each cell in the box has a diagonal board spanning two corners of the cell that can redirect a ball to the right or to the left.

- A board that redirects the ball to the right spans the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner and is represented in the grid as `1`.
- A board that redirects the ball to the left spans the top-right corner to the bottom-left corner and is represented in the grid as `-1`.

We drop one ball at the top of each column of the grid. Each ball can get stuck in the box or fall out of the bottom. A ball gets stuck if it hits a "V" shaped pattern between two boards or if a board redirects the ball into either wall of the box.

Return an array `answer` of size `n` where `answer[i]` is the column that the ball falls out of at the bottom after dropping the ball from the i-th column at the top, or `-1` if the ball gets stuck in the box.

### Strategy

1. **Initialize the Answer Array**: Create an array of size `n` to store the results for each ball.
2. **Simulate Ball Movement**: For each ball starting at each column:
   - Track the current position of the ball.
   - Move the ball based on the board direction:
     - If the board is `1`, check the next column to the right.
     - If the board is `-1`, check the next column to the left.
   - Check for scenarios where the ball can get stuck:
     - Hitting borders of the grid.
     - Hitting a "V" pattern created by `1` and `-1`.
3. **Record the Result**: Record the resulting column or `-1` if the ball gets stuck.

### Code

```javascript
function findBall(grid) {
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;
    const result = Array(n).fill(-1);
    
    for (let ball = 0; ball < n; ball++) {
        let col = ball;
        
        for (let row = 0; row < m; row++) {
            if (grid[row][col] === 1) {
                // If it hits the right wall or the right cell has a left diagonal
                if (col === n - 1 || grid[row][col + 1] === -1) {
                    col = -1;
                    break;
                }
                col++;
            } else {
                // If it hits the left wall or the left cell has a right diagonal
                if (col === 0 || grid[row][col - 1] === 1) {
                    col = -1;
                    break;
                }
                col--;
            }
        }
        
        // Record the column or -1 if stuck
        if (col !== -1) {
            result[ball] = col;
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: `O(m * n)` where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns. Each ball takes `O(m)` to traverse through rows, and there are `n` balls.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(n)` for storing the result of each ball.

### Summary

This solution effectively simulates the movement of each ball through the grid, checking at each step whether the ball gets stuck or moves to the next cell according to the grid's diagonal boards. By carrying out this simulation for each column, we can determine the final position or if the ball gets stuck.
