[Leetcode 749. Contain Virus](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l749)
## Problem Statement:
You are asked to help contain the spread of a virus across a two-dimensional grid of cells. Each cell can be infected or uninfected.

- The grid is given as `m x n` binary matrix, where `0` represents an uninfected cell and `1` represents an infected cell.
- Every day, each infected cell infects its four neighboring cells (up, down, left, right), if they are uninfected.
- Once an infected cell touches an uninfected cell, you can use walls to block the infection from spreading. That wall can be placed between an infected cell and an uninfected cell.
- You can only put walls around one region (connected component) of infected cells in a single day.
- Write a program to return the number of walls used to contain the virus completely.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: isInfected = [
  [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
  [0,1,0,0,0,0,0,1],
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1],
  [0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0]
]

Output: 10
```

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Do cells only infect orthogonal (up, down, left, right) neighbors, not diagonal ones?**
   - Yes, only orthogonal neighbors.
2. **Can cells on the edge spread the infection outside the grid?**
   - No, the infection only spreads within the grid.
3. **Do we always contain the most threatening region each day?**
   - Yes, focus on the region that can infect the most uninfected cells.

## Strategy:
1. **Identify Regions:**
   - Traverse the grid to identify all regions (connected components) of infected cells.
2. **Calculate Threats:**
   - For each region, calculate how many uninfected cells they can potentially infect.
3. **Contain Most Threatening Region:**
   - For the region that can infect the most cells, calculate the number of walls required to contain it and add to the total wall count.
4. **Update the Grid:**
   - Update the grid by infecting cells outside the contained region if it's not the most threatening one.
5. **Repeat Until Contained:**
   - Iterate the process until no further infections are possible or needed.

## Code:
```javascript
const containVirus = (isInfected) => {
  const directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]];
  const m = isInfected.length;
  const n = isInfected[0].length;

  const dfs = (x, y, visited, region, borders, frontier) => {
    const stack = [[x, y]];
    visited[x][y] = true;

    while (stack.length > 0) {
      const [i, j] = stack.pop();
      region.push([i, j]);

      for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
        const ni = i + dx;
        const nj = j + dy;

        if (ni >= 0 && ni < m && nj >= 0 && nj < n) {
          if (isInfected[ni][nj] === 1 && !visited[ni][nj]) {
            visited[ni][nj] = true;
            stack.push([ni, nj]);
          } else if (isInfected[ni][nj] === 0) {
            borders.push([i, j]);
            frontier.add(`${ni},${nj}`);
          }
        }
      }
    }
  };

  let walls = 0;

  while (true) {
    const visited = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(false));
    const regions = [];
    const frontiers = [];
    const bordersList = [];

    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
      for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
        if (isInfected[i][j] === 1 && !visited[i][j]) {
          const region = [];
          const borders = [];
          const frontier = new Set();
          dfs(i, j, visited, region, borders, frontier);
          regions.push(region);
          bordersList.push(borders);
          frontiers.push(frontier);
        }
      }
    }

    if (regions.length === 0) break;

    let mostThreatening = 0;
    for (let k = 0; k < frontiers.length; k++) {
      if (frontiers[k].size > frontiers[mostThreatening].size) {
        mostThreatening = k;
      }
    }

    walls += bordersList[mostThreatening].length;

    for (let [x, y] of regions[mostThreatening]) {
      isInfected[x][y] = -1;
    }

    for (let k = 0; k < regions.length; k++) {
      if (k === mostThreatening) continue;
      for (let pos of frontiers[k]) {
        const [ni, nj] = pos.split(',').map(Number);
        isInfected[ni][nj] = 1;
      }
    }

    if (!regions.some((_, idx) => idx !== mostThreatening && frontiers[idx].size > 0)) break;
  }

  return walls;
};
```

## Time Complexity:
- **O((M * N) ^ 2)** in the worst case since for each cell, we're repeatedly traversing up to M * N cells for part of the DFS and region containment, and this process can iterate for up to the total number of cells.
