[Leetcode 1782. Count Pairs Of Nodes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1782)
## Problem Statement
You are given an undirected graph defined by an integer `n` - the number of nodes, and `edges` - a list of pairs representing the edges between nodes. Calculate the number of pairs of nodes that are connected by at least one direct edge.

The graph is represented by:
- `n`: an integer representing the number of nodes.
- `edges`: a 2D array of integers where `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` represents an edge between nodes `ui` and `vi`.

Return the number of pairs of nodes that are connected by at least one direct edge.


## Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints**:
   - What are the minimum and maximum values for `n`?
   - Can there be duplicate edges or self-loops?
   - Should we consider the graph to be connected, or can it be disconnected?

2. **Output**:
   - Should pairs (u, v) be considered the same as (v, u), implying that the pairs are undirected?

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - What happens if `n` is 0 or 1?
   - What should be returned if there are no edges?

## Strategy
1. **Initialize**:
   - Create a set to store unique pairs of nodes that share a direct edge.

2. **Process**:
   - Iterate through the `edges` list.
   - For each pair `[ui, vi]` in `edges`, add both `(ui, vi)` and `(vi, ui)` or handle undirected pairs appropriately by sorting and adding to the set.

3. **Return**:
   - The size of the set should give the number of unique direct connections.

## Code
```javascript
function countPairs(n, edges) {
    // Using a Set to store unique pairs
    const uniquePairs = new Set();

    // Process each edge
    for (let [u, v] of edges) {
        // Ensure u < v to maintain a consistent order
        if (u < v) {
            uniquePairs.add(`${u}-${v}`);
        } else {
            uniquePairs.add(`${v}-${u}`);
        }
    }

    // Return the number of unique pairs
    return uniquePairs.size;
}

// Example usage
const n = 5;
const edges = [[1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [3, 4], [3, 4]];
console.log(countPairs(n, edges)); // Output should be the count of unique edges
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is O(k), where k is the number of edges. The space complexity is also O(k) due to the storage in the Set.

1. **Initialization**: O(1)
2. **Processing Edges**: Each edge is processed once, leading to O(k) complexity.
3. **Set Operations**: Adding and checking elements in a Set are O(1) on average.

This solution ensures that we count unique pairs efficiently while maintaining compliance with typical constraints of graph problems.
