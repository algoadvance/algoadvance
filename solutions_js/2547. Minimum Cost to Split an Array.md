[Leetcode 2547. Minimum Cost to Split an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2547)
### Problem Statement:

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You need to split the array into some number of non-empty subarrays such that the sum of the cost of all subarrays is minimized. 

The cost of a subarray `nums[l:r]` is defined as the number of distinct elements in the subarray `nums[l:r]` plus `k`.

Return the minimum possible sum of the cost of all subarrays.

**Example:**

```
Input: nums = [1,2,1,2,1,3,3], k = 2
Output: 8
Explanation:
- [1,2], cost is 3 (2 distinct elements + k = 2 + 2)
- [1,2], cost is 3 (2 distinct elements + k = 2 + 2)
- [1], cost is 3 (1 distinct elements + k = 1 + 2)
- [3,3], cost is 2 (1 distinct elements + k = 1 + 2)
Total cost is 8.
```

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Constraints on the array size and elements:** What are the constraints on the size of `nums` and the value of `k`?
2. **Nature of elements in `nums`:** Are elements in `nums` guaranteed to be integers, and can they be negative or zero?
3. **Output requirements:** Should the function always output an integer representing the minimum possible cost?

### Strategy:

We can use Dynamic Programming (DP) to solve this problem. Here are the steps:

1. **DP Array Initialization:** Define `dp[i]` as the minimum cost to split the subarray `nums[0:i]`.
2. **Base case:** `dp[0]` is `0` since there's no cost to split an empty array.
3. **Calculate Cost:** For each index `i`, calculate the cost of splitting the array at every position `j` such that `j < i`.
4. **Minimize Cost:** Update `dp[i]` as the sum of `dp[j]` and the cost to split the subarray `nums[j:i]`.

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity is `O(n^2)`, where `n` is the length of the array. This is because we potentially check every possible split position for each element in the array, and for each split, we compute the cost of distinct elements.

### Code:

```javascript
function minCost(nums, k) {
    const n = nums.length;
    const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(Infinity);
    dp[0] = 0;

    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        let freqMap = new Map();
        let distinctCount = 0;
        
        for (let j = i - 1; j >= 0; j--) {
            if (freqMap.has(nums[j])) {
                freqMap.set(nums[j], freqMap.get(nums[j]) + 1);
            } else {
                freqMap.set(nums[j], 1);
                distinctCount++;
            }
            
            const currentCost = distinctCount + k;
            dp[i] = Math.min(dp[i], dp[j] + currentCost);
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n];
}

// Example usage:
console.log(minCost([1,2,1,2,1,3,3], 2)); // Output: 8
```

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization:** `dp` array is initialized with `Infinity` as we are looking to minimize the cost, and setting an initial cost of zero for splitting an empty array.
2. **Iterate through the list:** For each `i`, a frequency map `freqMap` tracks the count of distinct elements in the subarray `nums[j:i]`.
3. **Calculate distinct elements:** As we iterate backward from `i` to `j`, update the frequency map and count of distinct elements.
4. **Update DP:** For each position `j`, compute the cost `currentCost` to split at that position and update `dp[i]` accordingly.
