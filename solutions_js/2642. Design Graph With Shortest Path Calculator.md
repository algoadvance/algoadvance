[Leetcode 2642. Design Graph With Shortest Path Calculator](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2642)
### Problem Statement

You are required to design a class `Graph` that supports the following methods:

1. **addEdge(from: number, to: number, edgeLength: number): void** - Adds a directed edge from node `from` to node `to` with a given `edgeLength`.
2. **shortestPath(start: number, end: number): number** - Calculates the shortest path between two nodes `start` and `end`. If there is no path, returns -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the nodes guaranteed to be non-negative integers?**
   - Yes, the problem statement implies that `from`, `to`, `start`, and `end` are non-negative integers.
   
2. **Can the edge weights be negative?**
   - Assuming standard shortest path algorithms and the absence of indication otherwise, we will assume edge weights are non-negative.

3. **Should we handle the case with nodes that haven't been defined yet?**
   - Yes, we should handle that. If either `start` or `end` node does not exist in the graph, we should return -1.

4. **Is the graph directed?**
   - Yes, the edges are directed, as specified in the problem statement.

### Strategy

- We will use Dijkstra's algorithm to compute the shortest path between two nodes because the algorithm efficiently handles graphs with non-negative weights.
- We will use an adjacency list to store the graph. The adjacency list is a common and efficient way to represent a graph.
- We will use a priority queue (min-heap) to pick the next node with the smallest tentative distance in Dijkstra's algorithm.

### Code

Here is the JavaScript implementation of the class `Graph`:

```javascript
class Graph {
    constructor() {
        this.adjList = new Map();
    }
    
    addEdge(from, to, edgeLength) {
        if (!this.adjList.has(from)) {
            this.adjList.set(from, []);
        }
        this.adjList.get(from).push({ to, weight: edgeLength });
    }
    
    shortestPath(start, end) {
        if (!this.adjList.has(start)) return -1;
        
        const distances = new Map();
        const pq = new MinHeap();
        pq.insert({ node: start, distance: 0 });
        distances.set(start, 0);
        
        while (!pq.isEmpty()) {
            const { node, distance } = pq.extractMin();
            
            if (node === end) return distance;
            
            if (distance > (distances.get(node) || Infinity)) continue;
            
            const neighbors = this.adjList.get(node) || [];
            for (let neighbor of neighbors) {
                const newDistance = distance + neighbor.weight;
                if (newDistance < (distances.get(neighbor.to) || Infinity)) {
                    distances.set(neighbor.to, newDistance);
                    pq.insert({ node: neighbor.to, distance: newDistance });
                }
            }
        }
        
        return -1;
    }
}

// MinHeap implementation for the priority queue
class MinHeap {
    constructor() {
        this.heap = [];
    }
    
    insert(item) {
        this.heap.push(item);
        this.bubbleUp(this.heap.length - 1);
    }
    
    extractMin() {
        if (this.heap.length === 1) return this.heap.pop();
        
        const min = this.heap[0];
        this.heap[0] = this.heap.pop();
        this.bubbleDown(0);
        
        return min;
    }
    
    bubbleUp(index) {
        while (index > 0) {
            let parentIndex = Math.floor((index - 1) / 2);
            if (this.heap[index].distance >= this.heap[parentIndex].distance) break;
            
            [this.heap[index], this.heap[parentIndex]] = [this.heap[parentIndex], this.heap[index]];
            index = parentIndex;
        }
    }
    
    bubbleDown(index) {
        const length = this.heap.length;
        const element = this.heap[index];
        
        while (true) {
            let leftChildIndex = 2 * index + 1;
            let rightChildIndex = 2 * index + 2;
            let leftChild, rightChild;
            let swap = null;
            
            if (leftChildIndex < length) {
                leftChild = this.heap[leftChildIndex];
                if (leftChild.distance < element.distance) {
                    swap = leftChildIndex;
                }
            }
            
            if (rightChildIndex < length) {
                rightChild = this.heap[rightChildIndex];
                if ((swap === null && rightChild.distance < element.distance) ||
                    (swap !== null && rightChild.distance < leftChild.distance)) {
                    swap = rightChildIndex;
                }
            }
            
            if (swap === null) break;
            
            this.heap[index] = this.heap[swap];
            this.heap[swap] = element;
            index = swap;
        }
    }
    
    isEmpty() {
        return this.heap.length === 0;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **addEdge(from, to, edgeLength):** O(1) as inserting into a Map and an array is average O(1).
- **shortestPath(start, end):** O((E + V) log V) where V is the number of vertices and E is the number of edges. This is because each vertex and edge might be processed once, and the operations on the priority queue (heap) take log V time.

This implementation uses Dijkstra's algorithm for finding the shortest path and a minimum heap to manage the priority queue. This ensures that the solution is efficient and scalable for large graphs.
