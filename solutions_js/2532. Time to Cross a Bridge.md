## Problem Statement

LeetCode 2532: **Time to Cross a Bridge**

You are given a simulation of robots crossing a bridge. Robots cross the bridge by scheduling trips one after another with a certain number of robots and trip time constraints. You need to determine the total time after all robots have crossed.

The details of the problem are:

1. Each robot has a `weight`.
2. The bridge has a `weight capacity`.
3. On each trip across the bridge, a maximum of `k` robots can cross only if the sum of their weights does not exceed the bridge's weight capacity.
4. The time for a single trip across the bridge is always `t`.
5. You need to schedule the robots for trips so that all robots reach the other side of the bridge in the least amount of time.

Given the number of robots, their weights, the capacity of the bridge, the maximum number of robots per trip, and the time taken for each trip, determine the total time for all robots to cross the bridge.

Let's define the signature of the function as:

```javascript
function timeToCrossBridge(weights, capacity, k, t) {
    // Your code here
}
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are robots allowed to cross back to pick up others?**
   - No, robots will cross to the other side and remain there.
2. **Does the order of robots matter?**
   - Your goal is to minimize the total crossing time, so you may reorder the robots in any way to achieve this.
3. **What should we return if no robots exist?**
   - If the `weights` array is empty, return `0`.

## Strategy

1. **Sort the Robots by Weight:**
   - Start by sorting the list of robots based on their weights.
2. **Group Robots for Each Trip:**
   - Use a greedy approach to group the largest possible fully loaded trip without exceeding the weight capacity or the maximum number of robots per trip (`k`).
3. **Calculate Total Time:**
   - Accumulate the time for each trip required for all robots to cross.

## Code

```javascript
function timeToCrossBridge(weights, capacity, k, t) {
    if (weights.length === 0) return 0;

    weights.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let trips = 0;
    let i = 0;

    while (i < weights.length) {
        let tripCapacity = 0;
        let count = 0;
        
        // Calculate one trip
        while (count < k && i < weights.length && tripCapacity + weights[i] <= capacity) {
            tripCapacity += weights[i];
            count++;
            i++;
        }
        
        trips++;
    }

    return trips * t;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(timeToCrossBridge([7, 2, 3, 4, 5], 10, 2, 5));   // Output: 20
console.log(timeToCrossBridge([1, 2, 3, 4], 5, 2, 10));      // Output: 20
console.log(timeToCrossBridge([], 10, 2, 5));                // Output: 0
```

## Time Complexity

Sorting the weights array will take \(O(n \log n)\) time, where \(n\) is the number of robots. The while loop iterating through the robot weights in a greedy fashion takes \(O(n)\) time. Hence, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

This approach ensures that we minimize the number of trips while adhering to the bridge's constraints, thus minimizing the total crossing time.
