[Leetcode 1830. Minimum Number of Operations to Make String Sorted](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1830)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` (which contains only lowercase English letters), compute the minimum number of operations required to make it lexicographically sorted in ascending order.

Each operation consists of:
1. Choosing a character from the string.
2. Moving that character to the front of the string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the maximum length of the string `s`?
   
   The typical string length constraint in such problems is up to 1000 characters.

2. **Character Constraints**:
   - Is the string guaranteed to have only lowercase English letters?
   
   Yes, the problem description specifies this.

3. **Output**:
   - Should the operations count be returned as an integer?
   
   Yes, the resultant minimum number of operations should be returned as an integer.

### Strategy

To solve this problem effectively:
1. **Lexicographical Order**:
   - A string is lexicographically sorted if it is in alphabetical order.

2. **Operations Mechanism**:
   - We need to count how many such operations are needed to move characters from their current position to the front progressively to get a sorted string.
   
3. **Algorithm**:
   - Loop through the characters from the end to the beginning of the string.
   - For each character, determine how many moves are necessary, bearing in mind all earlier characters.
   - Use a Fenwick Tree/Binary Indexed Tree (BIT) or another suitable data structure to efficiently keep track of the counts needed for moves.
   - Compute the total moves.

### Time Complexity

- Constructing the Fenwick Tree and performing operations will each be logarithmic, resulting in an overall time complexity of `O(n log n)` where `n` is the length of the string.

### Code

```javascript
function fenwickTree(n) {
    let tree = new Array(n+1).fill(0);
    
    function update(index, value) {
        index++;
        while (index <= n) {
            tree[index] += value;
            index += index & -index;
        }
    }
    
    function query(index) {
        if (index < 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        index++;
        let sum = 0;
        while (index > 0) {
            sum += tree[index];
            index -= index & -index;
        }
        return sum;
    }
    
    return {update, query};
}

function minOperationsToSortString(s) {
    const n = s.length;
    const maxVal = 26; // Only lowercase letters
    const base = 'a'.charCodeAt(0);
    
    const fenwick = fenwickTree(maxVal);
    let moves = 0;
    
    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        const charIndex = s.charCodeAt(i) - base;
        fenwick.update(charIndex, 1);
        
        moves += fenwick.query(charIndex - 1);
    }
    
    return moves;
}

// Example usage
console.log(minOperationsToSortString("cba")); // Expected output: 2
console.log(minOperationsToSortString("dabc")); // Expected output: 3
```

### Explanation:

1. A Fenwick Tree is initialized to handle 26 English characters.
2. We start from the end of the string and move backward.
3. For each character:
   - We update our Fenwick Tree to include the character.
   - We query the sum of characters that are smaller than the current character to get the number of necessary moves.
4. Sum all necessitated moves and return as the result.
