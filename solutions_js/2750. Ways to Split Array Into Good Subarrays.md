[Leetcode 2750. Ways to Split Array Into Good Subarrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2750)
### Problem Statement:
You are given a binary array `nums` (an array containing only `0` and `1`). A subarray `s` is called 'good' if there are exactly one `1`s in it.

A split of `nums` into some number of subarrays is called 'good' if each of these subarrays is 'good'.

Return the number of ways to split `nums` into 'good' subarrays. Since the answer may be large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **How large can the array be?** - This is important to understand the optimal time complexity required.
2. **What are `good` subarrays?** - Can you confirm they must each contain exactly one `1`?
3. **Must all elements in the array be used in a 'good' split?** - Is there a case where some elements are not used, or must all of them be part of subarrays?
4. **Are there constraints on the output format?** - Should I always return the result modulo `10^9 + 7`?

### Strategy:
1. Identify all the indices in the array where there is a `1` since each 'good' subarray needs exactly one `1`.
2. The problem boils down to counting the number of ways to split the array between these `1`s with any number of `0`s in between.
3. For every two consecutive `1`s in the array, the number of ways to partition the zeros between them contributes to the total number of 'good' splits.
4. Finally, the result should be returned modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Code:

```javascript
const MOD = 10**9 + 7;

var numberOfGoodSubarraySplits = function(nums) {
    const onesIndices = [];
    
    // Collect indices of '1's in the array
    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] === 1) {
            onesIndices.push(i);
        }
    }
    
    // If there are no '1's or only one '1', there are no ways to split into 'good' subarrays.
    if (onesIndices.length <= 1) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    let totalWays = 1;
    
    // Calculate the number of ways to split based on distances between consecutive '1's
    for (let i = 1; i < onesIndices.length; i++) {
        let distance = onesIndices[i] - onesIndices[i - 1];
        totalWays = (totalWays * distance) % MOD;
    }
    
    return totalWays;
};

// Example usage:
let nums = [1,0,1,0,1,1];
console.log(numberOfGoodSubarraySplits(nums)); // Output would depend on the input; e.g., this could be 8
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of the `nums` array. We traverse the array once to collect the indices of `1`.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(k)`, where `k` is the number of `1`s in the `nums` array, to store the indices of `1`s.

This solution processes the input array in linear time and calculates the result efficiently, making it suitable for large inputs.
