[Leetcode 1048. Longest String Chain](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1048)
### Problem Statement

You are given a list of words. Each word consists of lowercase English letters.

In one move, you can insert exactly one letter anywhere in the word (including at the beginning and end) to form a new word.

Find the length of the longest possible word chain you can get from the given list of words.

A word `w1` can be a predecessor of another word `w2` if and only if adding exactly one letter to `w1` anywhere in it results in `w2`.

A **word chain** is a sequence of words `[w1, w2, ..., wn]` where `w1` is a predecessor of `w2`, `w2` is a predecessor of `w3`, and so on.

### Example 1:
Input: words = ["a","b","ba","bca","bda","bdca"]
Output: 4
Explanation: One of the longest word chains is ["a","ba","bda","bdca"].

### Example 2:
Input: words = ["xbc","pcxbcf","xb","cxbc","pcxbc"]
Output: 5
Explanation: All the words can be placed in a word chain ["xb", "xbc", "cxbc", "pcxbc", "pcxbcf"].

### Example 3:
Input: words = ["abcd","dbqca"]
Output: 1
Explanation: The trivial word chain ["abcd"] is one of the longest word chains.


### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all words unique?**
    - Yes, each word in the list is unique.
  
2. **What is the maximum length of each word?**
    - The length is controlled by the constraints in the problem and can go up to a predefined limit, typically around 16 characters.

3. **How many words can the input list have at most?**
    - The number of words can be very large but usually within typical coding problem constraints, possibly up to 1000 or more.

### Strategy

1. **Sorting:**
   - Sort the words by their lengths. This is because a shorter word must precede a longer word in any valid chain.

2. **Dynamic Programming:**
   - Use a dictionary (`dp`) to store the longest chain ending at each word.
   - Traverse each word. For each word `w`, generate all possible predecessors (by removing one character at each position). Update the `dp[w]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp` value of predecessor + 1.

3. **Result Extraction:**
   - The length of the longest word chain will be the maximum value stored in the `dp` dictionary.

### Code

```javascript
var longestStrChain = function(words) {
    // Sort the words array by length
    words.sort((a, b) => a.length - b.length);
    
    // Initialize a map to keep track of the longest chain ending at each word
    let dp = new Map();
    
    let maxLength = 1;
    
    for (let word of words) {
        let currentLength = 1;
        
        // Generate all possible predecessors by removing one character
        for (let i = 0; i < word.length; i++) {
            let predecessor = word.substring(0, i) + word.substring(i + 1);
            if (dp.has(predecessor)) {
                currentLength = Math.max(currentLength, dp.get(predecessor) + 1);
            }
        }
        
        // Update the dp map with the longest chain ending at the current word
        dp.set(word, currentLength);
        
        // Update the maximum length found so far
        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, currentLength);
    }
    
    return maxLength;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of words.
- **Dynamic Programming Update:** `O(n * L^2)`, where `L` is the maximum length of words. For each word (n words), we generate `L` predecessors (each taking `O(L)`).

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n + n * L^2)`. Given typical constraints, this is efficient.

### Space Complexity

- **Space:** `O(n * L)` for the `dp` dictionary, where `L` is the length of the words and `n` is the number of words.
