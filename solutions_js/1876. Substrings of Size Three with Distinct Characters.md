[Leetcode 1876. Substrings of Size Three with Distinct Characters](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1876)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, return the number of good substrings of length three. A substring is considered good if all its characters are distinct.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
    - Is the input string `s` guaranteed to have a minimum length?
      - Yes, the problem implicitly assumes the string has a length such that there can be at least one substring of size three (so `len(s) >= 3`).
    - Will the input string contain only lowercase English letters?
      - Yes, itâ€™s safe to assume the string contains only lowercase letters as per typical problem constraints on LeetCode.

2. **Output**:
    - What type of output should be returned?
      - An integer representing the number of good substrings of length three.

### Strategy

1. **Sliding Window Technique**:
    - A fixed window of size three will be slid across the string to check each substring.
    - For each window, check if all characters are distinct.

2. **Algorithm**:
    - Initialize a counter to keep track of good substrings.
    - Traverse the string using a loop. For each position `i`, extract the substring of length three starting at `i`.
    - Use a set to check if all characters in the substring are unique.
    - If the length of the set is 3, increment the counter.
    - Continue this process until the end of the string is reached.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
function countGoodSubstrings(s) {
    let count = 0;

    // Loop through the string with a window of length 3
    for (let i = 0; i <= s.length - 3; i++) {
        let substring = s.substring(i, i + 3);

        // Use a set to check for distinct characters
        let uniqueChars = new Set(substring);

        // If the set has a size of 3, all characters are distinct
        if (uniqueChars.size === 3) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    return count;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - We iterate over the string once with a window of size 3 which gives O(n) complexity.
  - Each substring extraction and set size checking is O(1) since the operations are performed on a fixed size of 3 characters.
  
The algorithm is efficient with linear complexity concerning the size of the input string.
