[Leetcode 1631. Path With Minimum Effort](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1631)
## Problem Statement
**Title: Path With Minimum Effort**

You are given an `m x n` grid `heights` where `heights[row][col]` represents the height of cell `(row, col)`. You want to find a path from the top-left to the bottom-right cell such that the maximum absolute difference of heights between consecutive cells in the path is minimized.

Return the minimum effort required to achieve this path.

### Example:

**Input:**
```
heights = [
  [1, 2, 2],
  [3, 8, 2],
  [5, 3, 5]
]
```
**Output:**
```
2
```
**Explanation:**
```
The path with the minimum effort is [1, 2, 2] -> [3, 8, 2] -> [5, 3, 5], with maximum difference being 2.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Is the grid always non-empty?**
   - Yes, you can assume the grid will have at least one cell.
2. **Are the heights guaranteed to be positive integers?**
   - Yes, height values are positive integers.
3. **Can we assume the start point is always `(0, 0)` and the end point is `(rows-1, cols-1)`?**
   - Yes, the start point is always the top-left corner and the end point is always the bottom-right corner.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a modified Dijkstra's algorithm, which is typically used to find the shortest path in a weighted graph. Here, instead of minimizing the sum of weights, we need to minimize the maximum effort (i.e., the absolute difference in heights) we encounter along the path.

Steps:
1. **Initialize**:
   - Create a matrix `effort` the same size as `heights`, initialized to `Infinity`, except for the starting point which is 0.
   - Use a priority queue to help select the next cell to process based on the current minimum effort.

2. **Processing**:
   - Start from `(0, 0)` and explore the neighboring cells.
   - Update the effort for the neighboring cells if a lesser effort is found.
   - Continue to process the next cell with the minimum effort from the priority queue until we reach the bottom-right cell.

## Code

```javascript
const minimumEffortPath = function(heights) {
    const rows = heights.length;
    const cols = heights[0].length;
    
    // directions for moving up, right, down, left
    const directions = [[0, 1], [1, 0], [0, -1], [-1, 0]];
    
    // Min-heap/priority queue
    const minHeap = new MinPriorityQueue({priority: x => x.effort});
    minHeap.enqueue({ row: 0, col: 0, effort: 0 });
    
    // effort matrix to track the minimum effort to each cell
    const effort = Array.from({ length: rows }, () => Array(cols).fill(Infinity));
    effort[0][0] = 0;
    
    while (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
        const { row, col, effort: currEffort } = minHeap.dequeue().element;
        
        // If we have reached the bottom-right cell
        if (row === rows - 1 && col === cols - 1) {
            return currEffort;
        }
        
        for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
            const newRow = row + dx;
            const newCol = col + dy;
            
            if (
                newRow >= 0 &&
                newRow < rows &&
                newCol >= 0 &&
                newCol < cols
            ) {
                // Calculate effort to the new cell
                const newEffort = Math.max(currEffort, Math.abs(heights[newRow][newCol] - heights[row][col]));
                
                // Update the effort to the new cell if we found a smaller effort
                if (newEffort < effort[newRow][newCol]) {
                    effort[newRow][newCol] = newEffort;
                    minHeap.enqueue({ row: newRow, col: newCol, effort: newEffort });
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return 0;  // This line should never be reached
};
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this approach can be approximated as `O(E log V)`, where `E` is the number of edges and `V` is the number of vertices. For an `m x n` grid, `E` and `V` are both approximately `m * n`, leading to a time complexity of `O((m * n) log (m * n))`.

This should efficiently handle reasonably sized grids.
