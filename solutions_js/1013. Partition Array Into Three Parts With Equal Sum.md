[Leetcode 1013. Partition Array Into Three Parts With Equal Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1013)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `arr` of integers, return `true` if we can partition the array into three non-empty parts with equal sums.

Formally, we can partition the array if we can find indices `i` and `j` such that:

- `0 < i < j < arr.length - 1`
- `sum(arr[0..i-1]) == sum(arr[i..j-1]) == sum(arr[j..arr.length - 1])`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for elements in `arr`?**
   - Elements in `arr` can be any integer, positive or negative.
   
2. **Will the array always contain at least three elements?**
   - For a valid partition, the array must have at least three elements, so we can assume that as a precondition.

3. **What should the function return if a valid partition is not possible?**
   - If we cannot partition the array into three parts with equal sums, the function should return `false`.

### Strategy

1. **Calculate the total sum of the array.**
   - If the total sum is not divisible by 3, we can immediately return `false` because it's impossible to split it into three equal parts.
   
2. **Determine the target sum for each partition.**
   - This would be `totalSum / 3`.

3. **Traverse the array to find the partitions.**
   - Use two pointers or flags to track the cumulative sum. We need to find two points that split the array into three parts with the target sum.

### Code

```javascript
function canThreePartsEqualSum(arr) {
    const totalSum = arr.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
    
    if (totalSum % 3 !== 0) {
        return false;
    }
    
    const targetSum = totalSum / 3;
    
    let currentSum = 0;
    let partsFound = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        currentSum += arr[i];
        
        if (currentSum === targetSum) {
            partsFound++;
            currentSum = 0;
        }
        
        if (partsFound === 2 && i < arr.length - 1) {
            // If we have found two parts and we're not at the end, it means we can make the third part with the remaining sum
            return true;
        }
    }
    
    return false;
}

// Example Usage
console.log(canThreePartsEqualSum([0,2,1,-6,6,-7,9,1,2,0,1])); // Output: true
console.log(canThreePartsEqualSum([0,2,1,-6,6,7,9,-1,2,0,1])); // Output: false
console.log(canThreePartsEqualSum([3,3,6,5,-2,2,5,1,-9,4])); // Output: true
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` - We traverse the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` - We use a constant amount of extra space.
