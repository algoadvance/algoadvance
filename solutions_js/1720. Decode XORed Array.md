[Leetcode 1720. Decode XORed Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1720)
### Problem Statement
We have a given integer `first` and an array `encoded`, where `encoded[i] = arr[i] XOR arr[i + 1]`, and we need to decode the array to find the original array `arr`.

**Input:**
- An integer `first`
- An array `encoded` of length `n`

**Output:**
- Return the original array `arr` such that `arr[0] = first`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the size of the `encoded` array?
   - The size `n` can be any non-negative integer.
2. What kind of integers does the `encoded` array contain?
   - The `encoded` array contains non-negative integers.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} first
 * @param {number[]} encoded
 * @return {number[]}
 */
const decode = function(first, encoded) {
    const arr = [first];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < encoded.length; i++) {
        arr.push(arr[i] ^ encoded[i]);
    }
    
    return arr;
};

// Example Usage:
const first = 1;
const encoded = [1, 2, 3];
console.log(decode(first, encoded)); // Output: [1, 0, 2, 1]
```

### Strategy
1. **Initialization:** 
   - Start with `arr` where the first element is `first`.
   - Initialize a loop to iterate through the `encoded` array.
   
2. **Decoding Process:**
   - Use the property of XOR to find the next element in `arr`. Specifically, since `encoded[i] = arr[i] XOR arr[i + 1]`, we can derive `arr[i + 1]` as `arr[i + 1] = encoded[i] XOR arr[i]`.
   
3. **Fill the array:** 
   - Append each decoded value to the result array `arr`.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** \( O(n) \)
  - We iterate through the `encoded` array once, where `n` is the length of the array `encoded`. Each decoding step takes constant time.
  
- **Space Complexity:** \( O(n) \)
  - We need extra space to store the resultant decoded array `arr` which has a length of `n+1`.

This approach ensures efficiency, as the operations performed are minimal and directly utilize the properties of the XOR operation to decode the array.
