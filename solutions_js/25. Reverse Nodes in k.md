[Leetcode 25. Reverse Nodes in k](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l25)
### Problem Statement
Given the head of a linked list, reverse the nodes of the list `k` at a time, and return the modified list. If the number of nodes is not a multiple of `k` then left-out nodes in the end should remain as it is.

You may not alter the values in the list's nodes, only nodes themselves may be changed.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of values for `k`?
   - `k` is a positive integer and should be in the range of `[1, 1000]`.

2. What is the expected size of the linked list?
   - The linked list can have up to `5000` nodes.

3. Can the linked list be empty?
   - Yes, the linked list can be empty, in which case the function should return `null`.

### Code

Let's start with the implementation.

```javascript
class ListNode {
    constructor(val = 0, next = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.next = next;
    }
}

const reverseKGroup = function(head, k) {
    if (!head || k === 1) return head;

    let dummy = new ListNode(0);
    dummy.next = head;
    let curr = head,
        prev = dummy,
        next = null;
    let count = 0;

    // Count the number of nodes in the linked list
    while (curr) {
        count++;
        curr = curr.next;
    }

    // Execute the main logic only as long as there are at least k nodes to be reversed
    while (count >= k) {
        curr = prev.next;
        next = curr.next;

        // Reverse the k nodes
        for (let i = 1; i < k; i++) {
            curr.next = next.next;
            next.next = prev.next;
            prev.next = next;
            next = curr.next;
        }

        // Move the prev pointer k nodes ahead
        prev = curr;
        count -= k;
    }

    return dummy.next;
}
```

### Strategy
1. **Initialization:**
    - Create a dummy node to handle edge cases easily (`dummy`).
    - Initialize pointers `prev`, `curr`, and `next` to help in the node manipulation.
    - Count the total number of nodes.
    
2. **Reversing in Groups:**
    - Loop through the list as long as there are at least `k` nodes left to reverse.
    - For each group, move nodes one by one within the loop to the beginning of the list segment being processed.

3. **Maintaining Pointers:**
    - Adjust the `prev` pointer to proceed to the next segment of the linked list after each group reversal is completed.

### Time Complexity
- The solution involves two main loops:
  1. **Counting nodes:** \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the total number of nodes in the linked list.
  2. **Reversing nodes in groups:** Each node is visited and manipulated exactly once, leading to another \(O(n)\).

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\), which should be efficient for the given constraints.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since we are using a constant amount of extra space for the pointer variables only (ignoring the input and output space).

Feel free to ask any questions or request further clarifications!
