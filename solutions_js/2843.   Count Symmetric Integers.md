[Leetcode 2843.   Count Symmetric Integers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2843)
### Problem Statement

Given two integers `low` and `high` representing a range, count the number of symmetric integers in this range, inclusive. An integer is considered symmetric if its digits can be split into two halves that are mirror images of each other. For example, `121` is symmetric because `1` mirrors to `1` and `2` stands as the middle.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Range Validity**: Are `low` and `high` guaranteed to be valid integers where `low <= high`?
2. **Negative Numbers**: Are negative numbers considered, and if so, how do they affect symmetry?
3. **Single Digit Numbers**: Should single-digit integers be considered symmetric?
4. **Length of Numbers**: Is there a specific length of numbers to consider (e.g., should very large integers, like those beyond the usual boundaries of 32-bit integers, be considered)?
5. **Output**: Should the output just be a single integer representing the count of symmetric numbers?

For simplicity, I will assume:
- `low` and `high` are valid and within a reasonable range.
- Negative numbers are not considered.
- Single-digit numbers are considered symmetric.

### Strategy

1. **Iterate through Range**:
   - Iterate through each number from `low` to `high`.
2. **Check Symmetry**:
   - Convert each number to a string.
   - Check if the string representation of the number reads the same forwards and backwards (i.e., is a palindrome).
3. **Count Symmetric Numbers**:
   - Maintain a count of how many numbers satisfy the symmetry condition.

### Code

Here is the implementation:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} low
 * @param {number} high
 * @return {number}
 */
function countSymmetricIntegers(low, high) {
    function isSymmetric(num) {
        let strNum = num.toString();
        let len = strNum.length;
        for (let i = 0; i < len / 2; i++) {
            if (strNum[i] !== strNum[len - 1 - i]) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    let count = 0;
    for (let i = low; i <= high; i++) {
        if (isSymmetric(i)) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    return count;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Main Loop (Iterating through Range)**: O(n), where `n` is the number of integers from `low` to `high`.
- **Symmetry Check**: For each integer, the symmetry check (palindrome check) takes O(d), where `d` is the number of digits in the number. In the worst case, d can be log10(n).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n * d)**, where `n` is the number of elements in the range `[low, high]` and `d` is the maximum number of digits in these numbers. For practical purposes, since the number of digits is limited, this is often close to O(n).

This approach should efficiently count symmetric integers within a reasonable range.
