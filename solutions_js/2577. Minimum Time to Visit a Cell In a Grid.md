[Leetcode 2577. Minimum Time to Visit a Cell In a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2577)
## Problem Statement

You are given a `m x n` grid with value `0` representing a free cell and value `1` representing an obstacle. You can move up, down, left, and right. Your task is to determine the minimum time needed to visit all free cells starting from the top-left cell (0,0). If there is no way to visit all the free cells, return -1.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Is it guaranteed that the starting cell (0,0) is a free cell?**
   - Yes, the problem guarantees that (0,0) is always free.
2. **Can we assume the grid dimensions m and n are within a reasonable range (e.g., up to 1000x1000)?**
   - Yes, assume the grid size is within commonly used constraints for such problems.
3. **Can we revisit cells, or must each cell be visited only once?**
   - You can revisit free cells, but obstacles cannot be crossed.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm. This approach works well for unweighted grid problems because it explores all neighbors layer-by-layer, ensuring that we find the shortest path to visit all cells.

### Steps:
1. **Initialization**: Use a queue to hold the coordinates of cells to be explored, along with the distance (or time) from the starting cell.
2. **Visited Set**: Track visited cells to prevent reprocessing.
3. **BFS Execution**: Start from (0,0) and explore all four possible directions (up, down, left, right). For each direction, check if the new cell is within bounds, not an obstacle, and not yet processed. Add it to the queue and mark it as visited. Increment the time for every layer processed.
4. **Completion Check**: During exploration, count the number of cells visited. If the count equals the number of free cells, return the time. If the queue is exhausted but not all cells are visited, return -1 to indicate it's not possible to visit all cells.

## Time Complexity

1. **Initialization**: O(1)
2. **BFS Execution**: Each cell is processed once, so the complexity is O(m * n).
3. **Total Complexity**: O(m * n), where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns.

## Code

```javascript
function minTimeToVisitAllFreeCells(grid) {
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;
    
    const directions = [
        [0, 1],  // right
        [0, -1], // left
        [1, 0],  // down
        [-1, 0]  // up
    ];
    
    const queue = [[0, 0, 0]]; // [x, y, time]
    const visited = new Set(["0,0"]);
    
    let totalFreeCells = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === 0) {
                totalFreeCells++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    let visitedFreeCells = 0;

    while (queue.length) {
        const [x, y, time] = queue.shift();
        visitedFreeCells++;
        
        if (visitedFreeCells === totalFreeCells) {
            return time;
        }
        
        for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
            const newX = x + dx;
            const newY = y + dy;
            
            if (newX >= 0 && newX < m && newY >= 0 && newY < n && grid[newX][newY] === 0 && !visited.has(`${newX},${newY}`)) {
                queue.push([newX, newY, time + 1]);
                visited.add(`${newX},${newY}`);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return -1; // If not all free cells can be visited
}

// Example usage
const grid = [
    [0, 1, 0],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0]
];
console.log(minTimeToVisitAllFreeCells(grid)); // Output: 4
```

This code initializes the BFS from the top-left cell, processes each accessible cell, and tracks time taken to visit all free cells, eventually returning the minimum time or -1 if it's not feasible.
