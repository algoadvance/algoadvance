[Leetcode 1144. Decrease Elements To Make Array Zigzag](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1144)
### Problem Statement

Given an array `nums` of integers, a "zigzag" array is an array where the elements at even-indexed positions are greater than their adjacent elements, and the elements at odd-indexed positions are less than their adjacent elements (or vice-versa).

Your goal is to determine the minimum number of moves to make the array `nums` into a zigzag array. In each move, you can decrease a specific element by any positive integer.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array be empty or consist of a single element?**
   - For an empty array or a single element array, there are no moves needed as they inherently satisfy the zigzag condition.

2. **What if the elements of the array are already in a zigzag pattern?**
   - If the elements are already in a zigzag pattern, the minimum number of moves would be zero.

3. **Is there a constraint on the elements of the array (range of integers)?**
   - The constraints typically specify values, but for simplicity, let's assume the elements are arbitrary integers.

### Strategy

There are two possible zigzag patterns for an array of length `n`:
1. Even-indexed elements are greater than their adjacent odd-indexed elements.
2. Odd-indexed elements are greater than their adjacent even-indexed elements.

The strategy is to calculate the minimum number of moves needed for each of these patterns and return the smaller value.

1. **Pattern 1 (Even-indexed peaks)**:
    - For each even index `i`, ensure `nums[i]` is greater than both `nums[i-1]` and `nums[i+1]` if they exist.
2. **Pattern 2 (Odd-indexed peaks)**:
    - For each odd index `i`, ensure `nums[i]` is greater than both `nums[i-1]` and `nums[i+1]` if they exist.

### Code

```javascript
function movesToMakeZigzag(nums) {
    return Math.min(minMoves(nums, 0), minMoves(nums, 1));
}

function minMoves(nums, startIndex) {
    let moves = 0;
    const n = nums.length;

    for (let i = startIndex; i < n; i += 2) {
        let left = i > 0 ? nums[i - 1] : Infinity;
        let right = i < n - 1 ? nums[i + 1] : Infinity;
        
        let minNeighbor = Math.min(left, right);
        if (nums[i] >= minNeighbor) {
            moves += nums[i] - minNeighbor + 1;
        }
    }

    return moves;
}

// Example usage:
let nums = [9, 6, 1, 6, 2];
console.log(movesToMakeZigzag(nums));  // Output: 4
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where `n` is the number of elements in the array `nums`. This is because we are iterating through the array a constant number of times (specifically twice, for the two patterns), and each iteration is \(O(n)\).
