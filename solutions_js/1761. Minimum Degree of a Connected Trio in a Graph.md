[Leetcode 1761. Minimum Degree of a Connected Trio in a Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1761)
### Problem Statement
You are given an undirected graph. Youâ€™re given an integer `n` which indicates the number of nodes and an array edges where each `edges[i] = [ui, vi]` indicates that there's an undirected edge between `ui` and `vi`.

A connected trio is a set of three nodes such that there is an edge between every pair of them (i.e., a complete graph of three nodes).

The degree of a connected trio is defined as the total number of edges incident to nodes in the trio.

Return the minimum degree of a connected trio. If the graph has no connected trio, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can I assume that the nodes are numbered from 1 to n?
   - Yes, you can assume the nodes are labeled from 1 to n.
  
2. Can there be multiple edges between the same pair of nodes?
   - No, the graph is simple. There will be no multiple edges between the same pair of nodes.
   
3. Can there be self-loops in the graph?
   - No, there will be no self-loops. Each edge connects two different nodes.

### Strategy
1. **Graph Representation**: Use an adjacency matrix to easily check for the existence of edges and an array to keep track of the degree of each node.
2. **Finding Connected Trios**: Iterate over all pairs of nodes and check if they form a connected trio with any third node.
3. **Calculating Minimum Degree**: For any identified trio, calculate its degree by summing the degrees of its nodes and then subtracting 6 (since each edge in the trio is counted twice).

### Code
```javascript
var minTrioDegree = function(n, edges) {
    // Initialize adjacency matrix
    const adjMatrix = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () => Array(n + 1).fill(0));
    const degrees = Array(n + 1).fill(0);

    // Fill adjacency matrix and degrees array
    for (const [u, v] of edges) {
        adjMatrix[u][v] = 1;
        adjMatrix[v][u] = 1;
        degrees[u]++;
        degrees[v]++;
    }

    let minDegree = Infinity;

    // Check for connected trios
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j <= n; j++) {
            if (adjMatrix[i][j] === 1) {
                for (let k = j + 1; k <= n; k++) {
                    if (adjMatrix[i][k] === 1 && adjMatrix[j][k] === 1) {
                        // Trio (i, j, k) is connected
                        const degree = degrees[i] + degrees[j] + degrees[k] - 6;
                        minDegree = Math.min(minDegree, degree);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return minDegree === Infinity ? -1 : minDegree;
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**:
  - Adjacency matrix construction takes `O(E)` where `E` is the number of edges.
  - Checking for connected trios involves iterating all possible triplets of nodes, which is `O(n^3)`.
  - Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n^3) + O(E)` which simplifies to `O(n^3)` as `n^3` usually dominates.
  
- **Space Complexity**:
  - The adjacency matrix uses `O(n^2)` space.
  - The degrees array uses `O(n)` space.
  - Thus, the total space complexity is `O(n^2)`.

### Conclusion
The provided solution efficiently checks for connected trios and calculates the minimum degree using an adjacency matrix and a degree array, which is suitable given the problem constraints.
