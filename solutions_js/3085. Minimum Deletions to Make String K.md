[Leetcode 3085. Minimum Deletions to Make String K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3085)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` and an integer `k`. A string is called K-special if every character at every index in the string `s` has appeared at least `k` times before that index in the string. Your task is to return the minimum number of deletions required to make the given string `s` K-special.

### Clarifying Questions

Before diving into the solution, it's important to clarify the problem further:
1. **Constraints on String and Integer k**:
   - What are the maximum and minimum limits for the string length and the integer `k`?
2. **Case Sensitivity**:
   - Is the string case-sensitive?
3. **Special Characters**:
   - Can the string contain special characters, digits, etc.?

Let's assume:
1. The string length can be up to `10^5`.
2. The integer `k` can be as large as the string length.
3. The string is composed of lowercase English letters only.
4. The string is case-sensitive (default assumption with lowercase).

### Strategy

We need to track the frequency of each character as we progress through the string. If any character at a certain index does not meet the requirement of appearing at least `k` times before that index, we will delete it. 

To optimize this, we can use a sliding window/simulation approach:
1. Traverse the string while maintaining a frequency count of characters.
2. If a character at the current index doesn't meet the criteria (i.e., it hasn't appeared at least `k` times before), mark it for deletion.
3. Continue this process until we reach the end of the string.

### Code

Here's the JavaScript code to solve this problem:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var minDeletionsToMakeKSpecial = function(s, k) {
    if (k === 0) return 0;
    
    let freqMap = new Map();
    let deletions = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        let char = s.charAt(i);
        
        if (!freqMap.has(char)) {
            freqMap.set(char, 0);
        }
        
        if (freqMap.get(char) < k) {
            deletions++;
        } else {
            freqMap.set(char, freqMap.get(char) + 1);
        }
        
    }
    
    return deletions;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(minDeletionsToMakeKSpecial("aaabb", 3)); // Output: 0
console.log(minDeletionsToMakeKSpecial("aaabb", 2)); // Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity

- The solution runs in **O(n)** time complexity where `n` is the length of the string `s`. This is because we make a single pass through the string and perform constant-time operations (map access and updates) for each character.

- The space complexity is **O(1)** since the frequency map can hold at most 26 entries (in the case of lowercase English letters), which is considered constant space.

This solution efficiently handles the problem within the given constraints.
