[Leetcode 1402. Reducing Dishes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1402)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `satisfaction` of length `n` where `satisfaction[i]` is the satisfaction level of the ith dish. The chef can prepare any dish in 1 unit of time. The chef has decided to cook dishes in such a way that the total of satisfaction for all dishes is maximized. The total satisfaction of go-time is the sum of `satisfaction[i] * time`, where `time` is the order of cooking (starting at 1).

You should return the maximum sum of satisfaction the chef can achieve.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Should we consider all possible ways of cooking?
2. Are there any constraints on the values of `satisfaction`?
3. Is it possible for the array to contain negative values?
4. What is the acceptable time complexity for this solution?

### Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} satisfaction
 * @return {number}
 */
function maxSatisfaction(satisfaction) {
    // Sort the satisfaction array in ascending order
    satisfaction.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    let maxSatisfaction = 0;
    let currentSum = 0;
    let totalSum = 0;

    // Traverse the sorted array from the end
    for (let i = satisfaction.length - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        currentSum += satisfaction[i];
        if (currentSum > 0) {
            totalSum += currentSum;
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }

    return totalSum;
}

// Example usage
const satisfaction = [-1, -8, 0, 5, -9];
console.log(maxSatisfaction(satisfaction)); // Output: 14
```

### Strategy
1. **Sorting**: First, sort the array in ascending order.
   - Reason: We want to handle the most satisfactory dishes as late as possible if they are positive and as early as possible if they are negative.
2. **Reverse Iteration**: Starting from the dish with the highest satisfaction (i.e., the last element in the sorted array), move towards the dish with the lowest satisfaction.
   - Reason: This allows us to add more satisfactory dishes while the cumulative sum remains positive.
3. **Accumulation**: Maintain a running total of cumulative satisfaction and add it to the total satisfaction until the cumulative satisfaction becomes negative.
   - Reason: As soon as adding another dish would reduce the total satisfaction, we stop.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: `O(n log n)`
  - The sorting step takes `O(n log n)`.
  - The iteration through the sorted array takes `O(n)`.
- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)`
  - We are using a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

By sorting the array and then checking from the end, we ensure that we are considering the most beneficial dishes first, maximizing the satisfaction score efficiently.
