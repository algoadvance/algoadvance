[Leetcode 13. Roman to Integer](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l13)
### Problem Statement

Convert a Roman numeral to an integer. Given a Roman numeral, convert it to an integer. Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: I, V, X, L, C, D, and M.

| Symbol | Value |
|:------:|:-----:|
| I      | 1     |
| V      | 5     |
| X      | 10    |
| L      | 50    |
| C      | 100   |
| D      | 500   |
| M      | 1000  |

Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not "IIII". Instead, the number four is written as "IV". There are six instances where subtraction is used:

- I can be placed before V (5) and X (10) to make 4 and 9. 
- X can be placed before L (50) and C (100) to make 40 and 90. 
- C can be placed before D (500) and M (1000) to make 400 and 900.

Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Format:**
   - Will the input always be a valid Roman numeral string (i.e., no invalid characters and follows common Roman numeral conventions)?
   
   Yes, for this problem, assume the input is always a valid Roman numeral string.

2. **Output Format:**
   - Should the output always be a single integer?
   
   Yes.

### Code

```javascript
function romanToInt(s) {
    const romanToIntMap = {
        'I': 1,
        'V': 5,
        'X': 10,
        'L': 50,
        'C': 100,
        'D': 500,
        'M': 1000
    };

    let total = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        let current = romanToIntMap[s[i]];
        let next = romanToIntMap[s[i + 1]];
        
        if (next > current) {
            total += (next - current);
            i++; // Skip the next character as it's already been processed
        } else {
            total += current;
        }
    }
    
    return total;
}
```

### Strategy

1. **Create a Mapping:**
   - Use a hash map (`romanToIntMap`) to store Roman numeral symbols as keys and their corresponding integer values as values.

2. **Iterate Through the String:**
   - Loop through the characters of the input string `s`.
   - For each character, look up its integer value in the map.
   - Compare the current character's value to the next character:
     - If the next character's value is larger, it indicates a subtractive combination (like IV or IX). Subtract the current value from the next value and add the result to the total. Skip to the next iteration accordingly.
     - Otherwise, simply add the current value to the running total.

3. **Edge Handling:**
   - The loop is designed to handle the edge cases by checking the next character and adjusting the index `i` appropriately.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the string. Each character is processed a constant number of times.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as the space needed does not scale with the input size (the hash map is constant size and no auxiliary data structures are used).

This solution efficiently converts a Roman numeral to its corresponding integer value in linear time.
