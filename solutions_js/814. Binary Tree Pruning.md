[Leetcode 814. Binary Tree Pruning](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l814)
### Problem Statement

You are given the `root` of a binary tree, where each node has a value `0` or `1`. Prune the tree so that subtrees containing all `0`s are removed.

Return the pruned tree.

A subtree of a node `node` is `node` plus every node that is a descendant of `node`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input/Output Description**:
    - **Input**: The input is the root of a binary tree where each node has a value of `0` or `1`.
    - **Output**: Return the root of the pruned binary tree.

2. **Constraints**:
    - The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[1, 200]`.
    - Each node's value can either be `0` or `1`.

No additional clarifications seem necessary. Let's proceed to the solution.

### Strategy

1. We need to traverse the tree and decide whether to keep or prune each node.
2. If a node has value `0` and all of its subtrees are pruned (i.e., they also contain all `0`s), then this node should also be pruned.
3. We will use a post-order traversal to solve this problem because we need to process children before their parent.
4. If a node is `0` and both its left and right child are `None` (or pruned), then this node should also be `None`.

### Code

```javascript
class TreeNode {
    constructor(val, left = null, right = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

var pruneTree = function(root) {
    // Function to perform post-order traversal and prune the tree
    function prune(node) {
        if (!node) {
            return null;
        }
        
        node.left = prune(node.left);
        node.right = prune(node.right);
        
        // If this node is a 0 and both left & right are null (or pruned), prune this node
        if (node.val === 0 && node.left === null && node.right === null) {
            return null;
        }
        
        return node;
    }
    
    return prune(root);
};

// Helper function to print tree in-order for verification
function inOrderTraversal(root) {
    if (!root) return [];
    return [...inOrderTraversal(root.left), root.val, ...inOrderTraversal(root.right)];
}

// Sample Test
let root = new TreeNode(1, new TreeNode(0, new TreeNode(0), new TreeNode(0)), new TreeNode(1, new TreeNode(0), new TreeNode(1)));
console.log(inOrderTraversal(pruneTree(root)));  // Output should be a pruned tree
```

### Time Complexity

- The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because we visit each node exactly once.
- The space complexity is **O(h)**, where `h` is the height of the tree, due to the recursion stack in a worst-case scenario. In the case of a skewed binary tree, the height can be `O(n)`.

This solution effectively prunes the binary tree by removing nodes that do not contribute any `1` to the tree.
