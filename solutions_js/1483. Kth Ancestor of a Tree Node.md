[Leetcode 1483. Kth Ancestor of a Tree Node](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1483)
### Problem Statement

You are given a tree with `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` in the form of a parent array `parent` where `parent[i]` is the parent of `i`-th node. The root of the tree is node `0`. Implement the `TreeAncestor` class:

- `TreeAncestor(int n, int[] parent)`: Initializes the object with the number of nodes and the parent array.
- `int getKthAncestor(int node, int k)`: Returns the k-th ancestor of the given node `node`. If there is no such ancestor, return `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Is the maximum height of the tree bounded, or do we assume it can be as tall as the number of nodes allows?
2. Can the `parent` array contain values greater than the range `[0, n - 1]`?
3. Should I consider edge cases such as invalid `node` or `k` values?

### Strategy

We will use Binary Lifting, a technique that precomputes ancestors of each node at different powers of `2` for efficient ancestor querying. This allows us to answer each `getKthAncestor` query in \(O(\log n)\) time.

#### Steps:

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - We will create a `dp` table where `dp[i][j]` denotes the \(2^j\)-th ancestor of node `i`.
   - Initialize the `dp` table with direct ancestors from the `parent` array.
   - Use dynamic programming to fill in the rest of the `dp` table.

2. **Querying**:
   - To find the k-th ancestor of a node, represent `k` in binary and move up the tree node by node using precomputed ancestors.

### Code

```javascript
class TreeAncestor {
    constructor(n, parent) {
        this.LOG = Math.ceil(Math.log2(n)) + 1;
        this.dp = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(this.LOG).fill(-1));

        // Initialize first column of dp table with direct parents
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            this.dp[i][0] = parent[i];
        }

        // Precompute ancestors for each node
        for (let j = 1; j < this.LOG; j++) {
            for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
                if (this.dp[i][j - 1] !== -1) {
                    this.dp[i][j] = this.dp[this.dp[i][j - 1]][j - 1];
                }
            }
        }
    }

    getKthAncestor(node, k) {
        for (let j = 0; j < this.LOG; j++) {
            if ((k & (1 << j)) !== 0) {
                node = this.dp[node][j];
                if (node === -1) return -1;
            }
        }
        return node;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Preprocessing**:
   - Filling out the `dp` table takes \(O(n \log n)\) time.
2. **Querying**:
   - Each query can be answered in \(O(\log n)\) time due to the binary lifting approach.

This implementation ensures that the preprocessing is efficient and the queries are answered in logarithmic time, making it a suitable approach for large trees.
