[Leetcode 419. Battleships in a Board](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l419)
### Problem Statement

Given an `m x n` matrix `board` where each cell is one of `'X'`, `'.'`, count the number of battleships on the board. Battleships can only be placed horizontally or vertically on the board and completely occupy consecutive cells. 'X' represents a battleship and '.' represents empty slots. You must not modify the board and have to solve the problem using only O(1) extra memory.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can battleships touch each other?**
   - No, battleships cannot be adjacent to each other horizontally or vertically.
   
2. **Are there any constraints on the size of the board?**
   - The board can be large, up to 2000 x 2000 cells.
   
3. **Is it guaranteed that only valid ships will be present on the board?**
   - Yes, based on the problem constraints, the board will only contain valid ships and empty cells.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we'll traverse the board and look for the top-left corner of each battleship. A cell 'X' represents the top-left corner of a battleship if there are no 'X's directly above it and no 'X's directly to the left of it. This ensures we count each battleship only once.

### Code

```javascript
var countBattleships = function(board) {
    if (!board || board.length === 0) return 0;
    
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < board.length; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < board[0].length; j++) {
            if (board[i][j] === 'X') {
                if ((i === 0 || board[i-1][j] !== 'X') && (j === 0 || board[i][j-1] !== 'X')) {
                    count++;
                }
            }
        }
    }
    return count;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(m * n)
  - We traverse each cell in the `m x n` board exactly once.

- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
  - We use constant extra space regardless of the size of the board.

This solution is efficient given the constraints, as it leverages the properties of battleship placement and ensures that each battleship is only counted once.
