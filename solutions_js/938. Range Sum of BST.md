[Leetcode 938. Range Sum of BST](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l938)
### Problem Statement

Given the root node of a binary search tree (BST) and two integers `low` and `high`, return the sum of values of all nodes with a value in the inclusive range `[low, high]`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for the nodes in the BST?**
   - A: The values of the nodes in the BST are within standard integer ranges.

2. **Can the tree be empty?**
   - A: Yes, the tree can be empty. In that case, the sum should be 0.

3. **Are the boundaries `low` and `high` inclusive?**
   - A: Yes, the boundaries `low` and `high` are inclusive.

4. **Is the input BST guaranteed to be a valid binary search tree?**
   - A: Yes, the input tree is guaranteed to be a valid BST.

### Strategy

1. **Traversal Type**:
   - We'll use a Depth-First Search (DFS) approach to traverse the tree. Given the properties of a BST, this will allow us to efficiently determine if we should traverse the left child, right child, or both.

2. **Key Observations**:
   - If the current node's value is less than `low`, then all values in the left subtree are also less than `low` (because of the BST properties), so we only need to traverse the right subtree.
   - If the current node's value is greater than `high`, then all values in the right subtree are also greater than `high`, so we only need to traverse the left subtree.
   - If the current node's value is between `low` and `high`, we need to include this node's value in our sum and continue to traverse both left and right subtrees.

3. **Recursive Approach**:
   - We will use a recursive helper function that traverses the tree and accumulates the sum based on the above rules.

### Code

```javascript
class TreeNode {
    constructor(val = 0, left = null, right = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.left = left;
        this.right = right;
    }
}

var rangeSumBST = function(root, low, high) {
    // Helper function for recursive DFS
    const dfs = (node) => {
        if (node === null) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        if (node.val < low) {
            // Only traverse the right subtree
            return dfs(node.right);
        } else if (node.val > high) {
            // Only traverse the left subtree
            return dfs(node.left);
        } else {
            // Traverse both subtrees
            return node.val + dfs(node.left) + dfs(node.right);
        }
    }

    // Start the DFS traversal from the root
    return dfs(root);
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n)
  - In the worst case, we might have to traverse all nodes in the BST.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(h)
  - This is the space complexity due to the recursion stack, where `h` is the height of the tree. In the worst case (unbalanced tree), this can be O(n). In the best case (balanced tree), it will be O(log n).
