[Leetcode 1043. Partition Array for Maximum Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1043)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `arr` and an integer `k`. You can partition the array into contiguous subarrays of length at most `k`. After partitioning, each subarray has their values changed to the maximum value of that subarray.

Return the largest sum of the given array after partitioning.

### Example
```
Input: arr = [1,15,7,9,2,5,10], k = 3
Output: 84
Explanation: arr becomes [15,15,15,9,10,10,10]
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the length of the contiguous subarrays be less than `k`?**
   - Yes, the length can be less than or equal to `k`.
2. **Does the order of the array need to remain unchanged after partitioning?**
   - Yes, the order within the array should be maintained after manipulating the subarrays.
3. **Can the elements of the array be negative?**
   - No specific constraints, so we assume elements can be negative.

## Strategy
1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
    - Use a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` will store the maximum sum we can get by partitioning the subarray `arr[0:i+1]`.
    - Iterate through each possible subarray length `j` from 1 to `k` and update the `dp` value based on the maximum value in that subarray.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var maxSumAfterPartitioning = function(arr, k) {
    const n = arr.length;
    const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);

    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i++) {
        let max = 0;
        // Try to form subarrays ending at index `i - 1` with length `j` where 1 <= j <= k
        for (let j = 1; j <= k && i - j >= 0; j++) {
            max = Math.max(max, arr[i - j]);
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[i - j] + max * j);
        }
    }
    return dp[n];
};

// Example Usage
const arr = [1, 15, 7, 9, 2, 5, 10];
const k = 3;
console.log(maxSumAfterPartitioning(arr, k));   // Output: 84
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** The time complexity is \(O(n * k)\), where \(n\) is the length of the array and \(k\) is the maximum length of the subarrays.
    - We iterate through each element of `arr` once, and for each element, we might iterate up to `k` times for checking subarrays.
- **Space Complexity:** The space complexity is \(O(n)\) to store the `dp` array, where \(n\) is the length of the input array `arr`.
