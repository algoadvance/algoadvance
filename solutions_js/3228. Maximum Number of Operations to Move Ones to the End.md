[Leetcode 3228. Maximum Number of Operations to Move Ones to the End](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3228)
## Problem Statement

Consider an array `nums` consisting of `0's` and `1's`. We define an operation as being able to move a single `1` to either the left or right end of the array. You need to find the maximum number of such operations required to move all the `1's` to one of the ends of the array, either the left end or the right end.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
    - What is the size range of the input array `nums`?
    - Is the array guaranteed to consist only of `0's` and `1's`?

2. **Output Specification:**
    - Should we return the maximum number of operations required to move all `1's` to a particular end, or the minimum number of operations?
    
3. **Edge Cases:**
    - What should we return if there are no `1's` in the array?
    - Are we guaranteed at least one `1` in the input array?

Given the standard nature of such LeetCode problems, we'll assume:
- The array size is reasonably large, typical of LeetCode constraints (up to `10^5`).
- The array consists only of `0's` and `1's`.
- The goal is to find the maximum number of operations required, and there is at least one `1` in `nums`.

## Strategy

To maximize the number of operations to move all `1's` to either end, we need to consider both sides:

1. **Move all `1's` to the left end:**
    - Start from the rightmost `1` and calculate the moves required to reach the start of the array.
    
2. **Move all `1's` to the right end:**
    - Start from the leftmost `1` and calculate the moves required to reach the end of the array.

Here's how we can approach this:

1. Traverse the array to find the positions of all `1's`.
2. Calculate the cost (in terms of operations) to move each `1` to the leftmost position.
3. Calculate the cost to move each `1` to the rightmost position.
4. Return the maximum value obtained from both sides.

**Implementation:**

```javascript
function maxOperationsToMoveOnes(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    let leftOperations = 0;
    let rightOperations = 0;
    
    // Calculate left operations: move all 1's to the start
    for (let i = 0, pos = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (nums[i] === 1) {
            leftOperations += i - pos;
            pos++;
        }
    }
    
    // Calculate right operations: move all 1's to the end
    for (let i = n - 1, pos = 0; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (nums[i] === 1) {
            rightOperations += (n - 1 - i) - pos;
            pos++;
        }
    }
    
    return Math.max(leftOperations, rightOperations);
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**
  - We traverse the array twice, making the time complexity O(n), where n is the length of the input array.
  - The computation inside the loops involves simple arithmetic operations, contributing a constant factor.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is O(1) as we are using only a fixed amount of extra space regardless of the input size. 

This solution is efficient and should work within the constraints typically provided by LeetCode.
