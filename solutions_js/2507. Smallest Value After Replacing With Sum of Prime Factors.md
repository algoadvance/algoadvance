[Leetcode 2507. Smallest Value After Replacing With Sum of Prime Factors](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2507)
### Problem Statement

You are given a positive integer `n`. Continuously replace `n` with the sum of its prime factors until `n` becomes a prime number. Return the smallest value `n` can be.

**Example:**

1. **Example 1:**

    ```
    Input: n = 15
    Output: 5
    Explanation: Factors of 15 are 3 and 5. Their sum is 8. Factors of 8 are 2, 2, and 2. Their sum is 6. Factors of 6 are 2 and 3. Their sum is 5. 5 is a prime number.
    ```

2. **Example 2:**

    ```
    Input: n = 3
    Output: 3
    Explanation: 3 is already a prime number.
    ```

**Constraints:**

- `1 <= n <= 10^5`

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the output if `n` itself is prime initially?**
   - The output should be `n` if `n` is already a prime number.

2. **Is 1 a valid input and if so, what should be the output?**
   - Since `1` is not a prime number and doesn't have any prime factors, it's generally to avoid as input. But if considered, the problem is undefined in this case.

### Strategy

1. **Prime Check Function:**
   - Implement a function to check if a number is prime.

2. **Prime Factors Sum Function:**
   - Implement a function to find all prime factors of a given number and calculate their sum.

3. **Continuous Replacement:**
   - Continuously replace the number `n` with the sum of its prime factors until it becomes a prime, and then return that prime number.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */

// Helper function to check if a number is prime
function isPrime(num) {
    if (num <= 1) return false;
    if (num <= 3) return true;
    if (num % 2 === 0 || num % 3 === 0) return false;
    for (let i = 5; i * i <= num; i += 6) {
        if (num % i === 0 || num % (i + 2) === 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

// Helper function to find the sum of the prime factors of a number
function sumOfPrimeFactors(num) {
    let sum = 0;
    let factor = 2;
    while (num > 1) {
        while (num % factor === 0) {
            sum += factor;
            num /= factor;
        }
        factor++;
        if(factor * factor > num && num > 1) {
            sum += num;
            break;
        }
    }
    return sum;
}

var smallestValue = function(n) {
    while (!isPrime(n)) {
        n = sumOfPrimeFactors(n);
    }
    return n;
};
```

### Explanation

1. **Prime Check (`isPrime`):**
   - Checks if a number `num` is prime by ruling out divisible candidates up to the square root of `num`.

2. **Sum of Prime Factors (`sumOfPrimeFactors`):**
   - Finds prime factors of `num` and sums them up.
   - Starts from the smallest prime (2) and works its way up.

3. **Continuous Replacement (`smallestValue`):**
   - Continuously replaces `n` with the sum of its prime factors until `n` itself becomes a prime number.

### Time Complexity

1. **Prime Check:**
   - Worst-case time complexity is `O(sqrt(n))`.

2. **Sum of Prime Factors:**
   - Depends on the size and factorization of `n`. The time complexity here can be close to `O(log(n))` for checking all possible factors.

3. **Continuous Replacement:**
   - The loop continues until `n` becomes a prime number. In the worst scenario, this might involve multiple re-factoring steps, which together with primality test would be reasonably efficient for `n <= 10^5`.

Thus, the overall complexity combined is manageable within given constraints, typically around `O(k * sqrt(n))` where `k` is the number of replacement steps needed.
