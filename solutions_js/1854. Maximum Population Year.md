[Leetcode 1854. Maximum Population Year](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1854)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D array `logs` where each `logs[i] = [birthi, deathi]` indicates the birth and death years of the `i-th` person. The population of some year `x` is the number of people alive during that year. The `i-th` person is considered alive during the years `birthi` to `deathi - 1` (inclusive). For example, if `birthi = 1900` and `deathi = 1903`, the person is alive in the years 1900, 1901, and 1902.

Return the earliest year with the maximum population.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Are the years within a specific range? 
2. What is the range of values for `n` (number of logs)?
3. Can multiple people have the same birth and death year?
4. Is the input guaranteed to be valid (e.g., no negative years, well-formed arrays)?

### Strategy

1. Create an array `pop_changes` to track the changes in population per year.
2. Iterate through the `logs` array and mark the changes in population:
    - Increment the year of birth.
    - Decrement the year of death.
3. Calculate the running total of population changes to determine the population for each year.
4. Track the maximum population and the corresponding year.
5. Return the earliest year with the maximum population.

### Code

```javascript
function maximumPopulation(logs) {
    // Create an array to hold population changes
    const YEAR_OFFSET = 1950; // The problem guarantees that years range from 1950 to 2050
    const popChanges = new Array(101).fill(0);
    
    // Process each log entry
    logs.forEach(([birth, death]) => {
        popChanges[birth - YEAR_OFFSET]++;
        popChanges[death - YEAR_OFFSET]--;
    });
    
    // Determine the year with maximum population
    let maxPop = 0;
    let currentPop = 0;
    let maxYear = YEAR_OFFSET;
    
    for (let year = 0; year < popChanges.length; year++) {
        currentPop += popChanges[year];
        if (currentPop > maxPop) {
            maxPop = currentPop;
            maxYear = year + YEAR_OFFSET;
        }
    }
    
    return maxYear;
}
```

### Time Complexity

1. Initializing `popChanges` array is \(O(1)\) due to its fixed size.
2. Processing each log entry is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of entries in the `logs` array.
3. Iterating through the `popChanges` array to determine the max population year is \(O(1)\) due to its fixed size.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n)\). The space complexity is \(O(1)\) as the size of the array `popChanges` is constant.
