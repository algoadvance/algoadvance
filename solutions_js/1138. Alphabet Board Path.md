[Leetcode 1138. Alphabet Board Path](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1138)
### Problem Statement:

You have a board with the letters 'a' to 'z' and an initially empty string target. 

The board is like this:

```
a b c d e
f g h i j
k l m n o
p q r s t
u v w x y
z
```

Given the string target, return a sequence of moves to insert each character from the string target into an initially empty string where:
- `L` means move left
- `R` means move right
- `U` means move up
- `D` means move down
- `!` means insert the character

You start from the position of 'a' (0, 0) on the board.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **What if the target string contains characters that are outside 'a' to 'z'?**
   - The problem assures that the target string will only contain lowercase English letters.

2. **Is the output supposed to be a single string or an array of moves?**
   - The output should be a single string where each move and insertion is concatenated.

3. **Can the target string be empty?**
   - Yes, if the target string is empty, the output should also be an empty string.

### Strategy:

1. **Understanding Coordinates:**
   - Convert each character to its corresponding coordinates on the board.
   - The coordinates for character `c` can be calculated as `( (c-'a')//5, (c-'a')%5 )`.

2. **Moving between Coordinates:**
   - Calculate the difference between the current position and the target character's position.
   - Move in the required directions to achieve the target position.
   - Handle the edge case for moving to or out of 'z' which is on the last row.

3. **Constructing the Path:**
   - Construct the sequence of moves for each character from the current position to the desired position.
   - Append '!' after reaching each target character.

4. **Edge Cases:**
   - Handle movements within rows and boundary conditions separately, especially for the character 'z.'

5. **Concatenate the Result:**
   - Collect all moves step by step into a result string.

### Code:

```javascript
function alphabetBoardPath(target) {
    let result = '';
    let currentRow = 0, currentCol = 0;
    
    for (let char of target) {
        let targetIndex = char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0);
        let targetRow = Math.floor(targetIndex / 5);
        let targetCol = targetIndex % 5;
        
        // Order of movements matters when moving to or from 'z'
        // Move up first if necessary if the current character is 'z'
        if (currentRow == 5) {
            while (currentRow > targetRow) {
                result += 'U';
                currentRow--;
            }
        }
        
        // Move left or right
        while (currentCol > targetCol) {
            result += 'L';
            currentCol--;
        }
        while (currentCol < targetCol) {
            result += 'R';
            currentCol++;
        }
        
        // Move up or down
        while (currentRow > targetRow) {
            result += 'U';
            currentRow--;
        }
        while (currentRow < targetRow) {
            result += 'D';
            currentRow++;
        }
        
        // Append the '!'
        result += '!';
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(alphabetBoardPath("leet")); // Output: "DDR!UURRR!!DDD!"
```

### Time Complexity:

- The time complexity of the solution is O(n) where n is the length of the target string. This is because for each character in the target string, we compute its position on the board and generate moves to transition from the current position to the target position, each of which is constant time operations.
