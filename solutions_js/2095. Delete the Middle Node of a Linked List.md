[Leetcode 2095. Delete the Middle Node of a Linked List](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2095)
## Problem Statement

You are given the head of a linked list. Delete the middle node and return the head of the modified linked list.

The middle node is defined as the ⌊n / 2⌋-th node from the start using 0-based indexing, where n is the number of nodes in the linked list. For example, if there are 5 nodes, the middle node would be the node at index 2.

If the linked list has only one node, returning `null` is acceptable.

### Example 1:
```
Input: head = [1,3,4,7,1,2,6]
Output: [1,3,4,1,2,6]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4]
Output: [1,2,4]
```

### Example 3:
```
Input: head = [2,1]
Output: [2]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What type of nodes are in the linked list?**
   Each node in the linked list will contain an integer value.

2. **What should be returned if the linked list is empty?**
   If the linked list is empty, we should return `null`.

3. **Are there constraints on the size of the linked list?**
   There are no constraints given, but usual limitations for linked list size apply as per available memory.

## Code

Here's a JavaScript function to delete the middle node from a linked list.

```javascript
// Definition for singly-linked list.
function ListNode(val, next) {
    this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val)
    this.next = (next===undefined ? null : next)
}

var deleteMiddle = function(head) {
    if (!head || !head.next) return null;

    let slow = head, fast = head, prev = null;

    while (fast && fast.next) {
        prev = slow;
        slow = slow.next;
        fast = fast.next.next;
    }

    if (prev) {
        prev.next = slow.next;
    }

    return head;
};
```

## Strategy

1. **Initial Checks**: 
    - If the linked list is empty or contains only one node, return `null`.
  
2. **Use Two Pointers (Slow and Fast)**:
    - Initialize two pointers, `slow` and `fast`, both pointing to the head of the list and a `prev` pointer to keep track of the node before the `slow` pointer.
    - Move `fast` two steps at a time and `slow` one step at a time. This way, when `fast` reaches the end of the list, `slow` will be at the middle node.
    - Keep track of the previous node of `slow` using a `prev` pointer.

3. **Deletion**:
    - When the middle node is found (i.e., when `fast` reaches the end), adjust the `next` pointer of the `prev` node to skip the `slow` node.

4. **Return the Modified List**:
    - Return the modified head of the linked list.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of nodes in the linked list. This is because we traverse the list once to find the middle node.
The space complexity is `O(1)` since we only use a constant amount of extra space.
