[Leetcode 350. Intersection of Two Arrays II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l350)
## Problem Statement

Given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2`, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays, and you may return the result in any order.

### Example 1:
```
Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2,2]
```

### Example 2:
```
Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [4,9]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the arrays be empty?
   - **A:** Yes, the arrays can be empty, and in that case, the intersection would also be an empty array.

2. **Q:** Can the arrays contain negative numbers?
   - **A:** Yes, the arrays can contain negative numbers.

3. **Q:** Are the input arrays sorted?
   - **A:** The problem statement does not specify that, so we assume they are not necessarily sorted.

4. **Q:** How should duplicate elements be handled?
   - **A:** Each element in the result must appear as many times as it shows in both arrays.

## Strategy

1. We can use a hash map to store the frequency of each element in `nums1`.
2. Then, iterate through `nums2` and for each element, check if it exists in the hash map with a count greater than 0.
3. If it exists, add it to the result and decrement the count in the hash map.
4. Return the result array.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count and match elements between the two arrays.

## Code

```javascript
function intersect(nums1, nums2) {
    let map = {};
    let result = [];

    // Count elements in nums1
    for (let num of nums1) {
        if (map[num] == null) {
            map[num] = 1;
        } else {
            map[num] += 1;
        }
    }

    // Find intersections with nums2
    for (let num of nums2) {
        if (map[num] > 0) {
            result.push(num);
            map[num] -= 1;
        }
    }

    return result;
}

// Example usage:
// console.log(intersect([1,2,2,1], [2,2])); // Output: [2, 2]
// console.log(intersect([4,9,5], [9,4,9,8,4])); // Output: [4, 9]
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Building the frequency map (hash map):** O(n), where `n` is the length of `nums1`.
2. **Iterating through `nums2` and constructing the result:** O(m), where `m` is the length of `nums2`.

Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n + m).

## Space Complexity

1. **Hash map storage:** O(n), where `n` is the number of unique elements in `nums1`.
2. **Result array storage:** Worst case O(min(n, m)), where the intersection could be as large as the smaller array between `nums1` and `nums2`.

Hence, the overall space complexity is O(n).
