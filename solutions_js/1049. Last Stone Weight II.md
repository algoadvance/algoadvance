[Leetcode 1049. Last Stone Weight II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1049)
### Problem Statement
You are given an array of integers `stones` where `stones[i]` is the weight of the ith stone. We are playing a game with these stones. Each turn, we choose any two stones and smash them together. Suppose the stones have weights `x` and `y` with `x <= y`. The result of this smash is:
- If `x == y`, both stones are destroyed.
- If `x != y`, the stone of weight `x` is destroyed, and the stone of weight `y` has new weight `y - x`.

At the end of the game, there is at most one stone left. Return the smallest possible weight of this stone left. If there are no stones left, return 0.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can the array be empty?**
   - No, the array will have at least one stone.
2. **Are the weights positive integers?**
   - Yes, all stone weights are positive integers.

### Strategy
This problem is similar to finding two subsets of the given stones such that the absolute difference of their sums is minimized. This can be viewed as a variation of the classic partition problem.

Here is the strategy in a step-by-step manner:
1. **Dynamic Programming Approach:**
   - We'll use a dynamic programming array `dp` to determine if a particular sum is achievable with any subset of the given stones.
   - Initialize `dp` with a size of half of the total sum of stones, as we are trying to partition it into two subsets as closely as possible.
   - Use the 0/1 knapsack approach to update the dp array, where `dp[i]` indicates if a subset with sum `i` is achievable.
   - Once we have the `dp` array filled, find the largest sum `s1` which does not exceed half of the total sum. The other subset sum `s2` will be the difference between total sum and `s1`.
   - The answer will be the absolute difference `abs(s1 - s2)`.

### Code
```javascript
function lastStoneWeightII(stones) {
    const totalSum = stones.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
    const target = Math.floor(totalSum / 2);
    
    // Create dp array
    const dp = new Array(target + 1).fill(false);
    dp[0] = true; // sum of 0 is always possible with empty subset
    
    // Fill the dp array
    for (const stone of stones) {
        for (let i = target; i >= stone; --i) {
            dp[i] = dp[i] || dp[i - stone];
        }
    }
    
    // Find the best possible partition
    for (let i = target; i >= 0; --i) {
        if (dp[i]) {
            const s1 = i;
            const s2 = totalSum - s1;
            return Math.abs(s2 - s1);
        }
    }
    
    return 0;
}

// Example usage
console.log(lastStoneWeightII([2,7,4,1,8,1])); // Output: 1
console.log(lastStoneWeightII([31,26,33,21,40])); // Output: 5
```

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n * target) where `n` is the number of stones, and `target` is half of the total sum.
- **Space Complexity:** O(target) for the `dp` array.

This approach ensures that we efficiently find the smallest possible difference between the two subsets, leading to the smallest possible weight of the last remaining stone.
