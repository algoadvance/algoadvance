[Leetcode 908. Smallest Range I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l908)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. In one operation, you can choose any element of the array and increase or decrease it by `k`. Write a function to return the smallest possible difference between the maximum value and the minimum value of the array after performing any number of operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints:**
   - `nums.length` will be between 1 and 10,000.
   - Each element in `nums` will be between 0 and 10,000.
   - `k` is a non-negative integer.

2. **Output:**
   - Return an integer representing the smallest possible difference.

3. **Operations:**
   - You can increase or decrease any element by `k`.
   - This can be done multiple times on multiple elements.

### Example
```javascript
Input: nums = [1, 3, 6], k = 3
Output: 0
Explanation: Increase the first element with k twice. nums = [7, 3, 6] 

Input: nums = [0, 10], k = 2
Output: 6
Explanation: Increase the first element by 2, decrease the second by 2. nums = [2, 8]
```

## Strategy

1. **Find the Initial Range:**
   - Compute the initial minimum and maximum of the `nums` array.
   - Compute the initial range as `max - min`.

2. **Adjusting the Range:**
   - The aim is to reduce this initial range by adjusting elements using `k`.
   - After increasing and/or decreasing any number by `k`, the minimum could become `min + k`. The maximum could become `max - k`. The smallest possible difference would then be `(max - k) - (min + k)`.
   
3. **Edge Case:**
   - If `max - min` is already less than or equal to `2 * k`, then itâ€™s possible to reduce the range to 0.

### Solution in Javascript

```javascript
function smallestRangeI(nums, k) {
    if (nums.length === 0) return 0;
    
    let min = Math.min(...nums);
    let max = Math.max(...nums);
    
    let range = max - min;
    
    // The smallest range we can achieve after adjusting with k
    return Math.max(0, range - 2 * k);
}

// Test cases
console.log(smallestRangeI([1, 3, 6], 3));   // Output: 0
console.log(smallestRangeI([0, 10], 2));     // Output: 6
console.log(smallestRangeI([1], 0));         // Output: 0
console.log(smallestRangeI([2, 2], 1));      // Output: 0
console.log(smallestRangeI([7, 8, 8], 5));   // Output: 0
```

## Time Complexity

- **Finding the minimum and maximum:** `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the `nums`.
- **Computing the range and the smallest possible difference:** `O(1)`.

Overall, the time complexity is **O(n)**.
