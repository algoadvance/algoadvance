[Leetcode 773. Sliding Puzzle](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l773)
## Problem Statement

On a 2x3 board, there are 5 tiles labeled from 1 to 5, and an empty square represented by 0. A move consists of swapping the empty square with one of the 4 neighbors (up, down, left, or right). Given the initial state of the board and the final state of the board, calculate the minimum number of moves required to reach the final state from the initial state, or return -1 if it's not possible.

**Examples:**

```
Input: board = [[1,2,3],[4,0,5]]
Output: 1
Explanation: Swap the 0 and 5 in one move.

Input: board = [[1,2,3],[5,4,0]]
Output: -1
Explanation: The puzzle is unsolvable.

Input: board = [[4,1,2],[5,0,3]]
Output: 5
Explanation: 5 moves are required to reach [[1,2,3],[4,5,0]].
```

**Constraints:**

- `board` is a 2x3 list containing the digits 0 through 5.

## Clarifying Questions

Before proceeding, confirm these details:

1. Is the input always valid (i.e., always a 2x3 board containing the digits 0 through 5)?
2. Are multiple solutions with the same number of moves acceptable, or do we need to find a specific path?
3. Are there any performance constraints we should be aware of, like maximum number of moves or execution time?

## Strategy

1. **Modeling the Puzzle as a Graph Problem:**
   - Treat each board configuration as a node.
   - Moves (swaps with the empty square) form the edges between nodes.
   - Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to explore the shortest path from the initial configuration to the target configuration.

2. **BFS Implementation Steps:**
   - Convert the board to a string for easy comparison and hashability.
   - Use a queue to explore neighbor configurations.
   - Use a set to store visited configurations to avoid revisiting.

3. **Movements Logic:**
   - Possible moves are up, down, left, right based on the current index of the empty square (0).
   - Define a helper function to generate all possible moves.

4. **Edge cases:**
   - Start state is the same as the target state (return 0 moves).
   - Given configuration does not have a path to the target (return -1).

## Code

Here's the implementation of the BFS approach to solve the sliding puzzle problem:

```javascript
function slidingPuzzle(board) {
    const target = '123450';
    
    // Convert the initial board to a string.
    const start = board.flat().join('');
    
    // If starting position is already the target, return 0 moves.
    if (start === target) return 0;
    
    // Possible moves for each index in the flattened board array.
    const moves = [
        [1, 3],    // index 0 can move to indices 1 and 3
        [0, 2, 4], // index 1 can move to indices 0, 2, and 4
        [1, 5],    // index 2 can move to indices 1 and 5
        [0, 4],    // index 3 can move to indices 0 and 4
        [1, 3, 5], // index 4 can move to indices 1, 3, and 5
        [2, 4]     // index 5 can move to indices 2 and 4
    ];
    
    // Initialize the BFS.
    const queue = [[start, start.indexOf('0'), 0]]; // [current board configuration, index of 0, depth]
    const visited = new Set();
    visited.add(start);
    
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const [current, zeroIndex, depth] = queue.shift();
        
        // Try all possible moves for the current configuration.
        for (let move of moves[zeroIndex]) {
            const next = current.split('');
            // Swap the 0 with the target.
            [next[zeroIndex], next[move]] = [next[move], next[zeroIndex]];
            const nextConfig = next.join('');
            
            // Check if we've reached the target configuration.
            if (nextConfig === target) return depth + 1;
            
            if (!visited.has(nextConfig)) {
                visited.add(nextConfig);
                queue.push([nextConfig, move, depth + 1]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    // If BFS completes with no solution, return -1.
    return -1;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity is O((m*n)!), which is factorial in the number of cells in the board. Given the constraints (2x3 board, hence 6 cells), this is manageable.

- Each move generates new configurations, the total possible configurations are limited by the size of the board.
- Space complexity is O((m*n)!) due to the size of the queue and visited set.
