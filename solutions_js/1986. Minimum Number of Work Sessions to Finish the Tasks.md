[Leetcode 1986. Minimum Number of Work Sessions to Finish the Tasks](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1986)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `tasks`, where `tasks[i]` represents the i-th task's duration. You are also given an integer `sessionTime` which represents the maximum duration of each work session. You need to find the minimum number of work sessions required to finish all the tasks without exceeding the duration limit of each session.

### Clarifying Questions

Before we proceed with the solution, let's clarify a few things:

1. **Are the durations of the tasks and the session time positive integers?**
   - Yes, all durations including `sessionTime` will be positive integers.

2. **Can a task duration exceed the session time?**
   - No, none of the task durations will exceed the `sessionTime`.

3. **Is there any specific limit on the number of tasks?**
   - The constraints will be reasonable for the purpose of algorithmic complexity.

### Strategy

This problem can be approached with a backtracking algorithm combined with Dynamic Programming (DP) to keep track of the minimum number of sessions. Here's how we can think about the solution:

1. **Backtracking:** Try to place each task into existing sessions or start a new session if the current session time is not enough.
2. **Memoization:** Record the state of the sessions to avoid redundant calculations and speed up the process.

### Code

Let's implement this strategy in JavaScript.

```javascript
var minSessions = function(tasks, sessionTime) {
    let n = tasks.length;
    let memo = new Map();
    
    const dfs = (mask, currentSessionTime) => {
        if (mask === (1 << n) - 1) {
            return currentSessionTime === 0 ? 0 : 1;
        }
        
        let key = `${mask},${currentSessionTime}`;
        if (memo.has(key)) return memo.get(key);
        
        let result = Infinity;
        for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            if ((mask & (1 << i)) === 0) {
                if (tasks[i] + currentSessionTime <= sessionTime) {
                    result = Math.min(result, dfs(mask | (1 << i), currentSessionTime + tasks[i]));
                } else {
                    result = Math.min(result, 1 + dfs(mask | (1 << i), tasks[i]));
                }
            }
        }
        
        memo.set(key, result);
        return result;
    };
    
    return dfs(0, 0);
};

// Example usage:
let tasks = [1, 3, 5, 8];
let sessionTime = 8;
console.log(minSessions(tasks, sessionTime)); // Expected output: 2
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach relates to the combination of all tasks:
- **Mask State Combination:** There are `2^n` states as every task can either be in or out of the session.
- **Session Combinations:** For each state, up to `n` tasks can be considered.

Hence the complexity is `O(2^n * n)`, which is feasible for the size constraints typically given in interview problems.

By memoizing the results of each state, we avoid redundant calculations and speed up the process significantly. This approach should handle typical interview constraints effectively.
