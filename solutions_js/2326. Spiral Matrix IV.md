[Leetcode 2326. Spiral Matrix IV](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2326)
### Problem Statement
You are given a 2D integer array of size `m x n` and an integer linked list with `head` as the first node. Rotate the matrix in a spiral order to populate it, starting from the top-left and going inwards, and output the populated matrix. 

**Input:**
- A 2D integer array `matrix` of `m x n` which will be filled with values from the linked list.
- An integer linked list `head` which is the head node of the list.

**Output:**
- A `m x n` matrix filled in spiral order with the values from the given linked list. If there are remaining empty spaces, fill them with `-1`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What should be done if the linked list contains more elements than the matrix can accommodate?
   - Anything beyond the capacity can be ignored or not used.
  
2. What should we do if the linked list contains fewer elements than the total number of cells in the matrix?
   - Any remaining cells in the matrix should be filled with `-1`.

3. What are the constraints on the size of the matrix and the linked list?
   - Assume constraints are reasonably small for a coding interview.

### Strategy
1. Initialize pointers for the boundary (top, bottom, left, right) of the spiral traversal.
2. Traverse the matrix in a spiral order while populating the matrix with values from the linked list.
3. If the linked list is exhausted before the matrix is completely filled, continue filling remaining cells with `-1`.
4. Return the populated matrix.

### Code

```javascript
class ListNode {
    constructor(val = 0, next = null) {
        this.val = val;
        this.next = next;
    }
}

function spiralMatrix(m, n, head) {
    const matrix = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(-1));

    let top = 0, bottom = m - 1, left = 0, right = n - 1;
    let currentNode = head;

    while (top <= bottom && left <= right) {
        // Fill top row
        for (let col = left; col <= right; col++) {
            if (currentNode) {
                matrix[top][col] = currentNode.val;
                currentNode = currentNode.next;
            }
        }
        top++;

        // Fill right column
        for (let row = top; row <= bottom; row++) {
            if (currentNode) {
                matrix[row][right] = currentNode.val;
                currentNode = currentNode.next;
            }
        }
        right--;

        // Fill bottom row
        if (top <= bottom) {
            for (let col = right; col >= left; col--) {
                if (currentNode) {
                    matrix[bottom][col] = currentNode.val;
                    currentNode = currentNode.next;
                }
            }
            bottom--;
        }

        // Fill left column
        if (left <= right) {
            for (let row = bottom; row >= top; row--) {
                if (currentNode) {
                    matrix[row][left] = currentNode.val;
                    currentNode = currentNode.next;
                }
            }
            left++;
        }
    }

    return matrix;
}

// Example to test the code
let head = new ListNode(3, new ListNode(0, new ListNode(2, new ListNode(6, new ListNode(8, new ListNode(1, new ListNode(7, new ListNode(5, new ListNode(4)))))))));
console.log(spiralMatrix(3, 5, head));
```

### Time Complexity
- The algorithm traverses each cell of the matrix once, hence the time complexity is `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.

### Space Complexity
- The space complexity is `O(1)` if we don't consider the output matrix, as we're using only a fixed amount of extra space. If we consider the output matrix, itâ€™s `O(m * n)`.
