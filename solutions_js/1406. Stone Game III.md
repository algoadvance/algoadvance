[Leetcode 1406. Stone Game III](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1406)
### Problem Statement

Alice and Bob continue their games with piles of stones. There are several stones arranged in a row, and each stone has an associated value which is an integer. The goal of the game is to end with the most stones. 

Alice and Bob take turns, with Alice starting first. On each player's turn, that player can take 1, 2, or 3 stones from the front (the start) of the row. The game ends when all the stones have been taken. 

The person with the most stones wins. If the scores of both players are equal, then the game is a draw. The function should return "Alice" if Alice will win, "Bob" if Bob will win, or "Tie" if it is a draw.

The function signature is:
```javascript
function stoneGameIII(stoneValue: number[]): string
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. Is the length of `stoneValue` guaranteed to be at least 1?
2. Are the values of `stoneValue` potentially negative?

### Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming with Memoization:** 
   - Use an array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum score difference Alice can achieve starting from the `i-th` stone.
   - Base case: `dp[n] = 0`, where `n` is the length of `stoneValue`, meaning no more stones can be taken.
   - Transition: For each position `i`, Alice can take 1, 2, or 3 stones and optimize her score accordingly by evaluating the result from the next state.
   - Compute the difference in scores Alice can achieve and then determine the result based on whether Alice's advantage is positive, negative, or zero.

### Code

```javascript
function stoneGameIII(stoneValue) {
    const n = stoneValue.length;
    
    // dp[i] will be the maximum score difference starting from index i
    const dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(0);
    
    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        let take = 0;
        dp[i] = Number.MIN_SAFE_INTEGER;
        
        for (let j = 0; j < 3 && i + j < n; j++) {
            take += stoneValue[i + j];
            dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], take - dp[i + j + 1]);
        }
    }
    
    if (dp[0] > 0) {
        return "Alice";
    } else if (dp[0] < 0) {
        return "Bob";
    } else {
        return "Tie";
    }
}

// Example usage:
console.log(stoneGameIII([1, 2, 3, 7])); // "Bob"
console.log(stoneGameIII([1, 2, 3, -9])); // "Alice"
console.log(stoneGameIII([1, 2, 3, 6])); // "Tie"
console.log(stoneGameIII([1, 2, 3, -1, -2, -3, 7])); // "Alice"
console.log(stoneGameIII([-1, -2, -3])); // "Tie"
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n)**:
- We iterate through the array of stones once in reverse order.
- For each position `i`, we consider up to 3 possible moves, which is a constant factor.

The space complexity is also **O(n)** due to the `dp` array that stores the maximum score differences for each position.
