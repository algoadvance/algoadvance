[Leetcode 2316. Count Unreachable Pairs of Nodes in an Undirected Graph](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2316)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer `n`. There is an undirected graph with `n` nodes, numbered from `0` to `n - 1`. You are also given a 2D integer array `edges` where `edges[i] = [a(i), b(i)]` denotes that there exists an undirected edge connecting nodes `a(i)` and `b(i)`.

Return the number of pairs of different nodes that are unreachable from each other.

### Example:

```
Input: n = 6, edges = [[0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4], [1, 2], [2, 5]]
Output: 4
Explanation: There are 4 pairs of nodes that are unreachable from each other:
- (0, 1), (0, 5), (3, 1), and (4, 1)
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Are there any self-loops or multiple edges between the same pair of nodes?**
   No, each pair of nodes `(a, b)` appears at most once in the graph.

2. **What are the constraints on the input size?**
   The constraints are:
   - `1 <= n <= 10^5`
   - `0 <= edges.length <= 2 * 10^5`
   - `edges[i].length == 2`
   - `0 <= a(i) < b(i) < n`
   - There are no duplicate edges.

3. **Should the solution handle disconnected graphs?**
   Yes, it needs to account for multiple disconnected components.

## Strategy

To solve the problem, we need to:

1. **Find all connected components**: Nodes that are reachable from one another form connected components. We can use Depth-First Search (DFS) or Breadth-First Search (BFS) to determine these components.
   
2. **Count sizes of connected components**: For every node, determine the size of its connected component.
   
3. **Count unreachable pairs**: If we know the sizes of all connected components, the count of unreachable pairs between nodes in different components can be calculated using combinatorics.

### Steps:

1. Build an adjacency list from the `edges`.
2. Use DFS or BFS to find all connected components.
3. Calculate the size of each component.
4. Use the sizes of the components to count unreachable pairs.

## Code

Here is the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function countPairs(n, edges) {
    // Function to build the adjacency list
    const buildAdjacencyList = (n, edges) => {
        const adjList = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
        for (const [u, v] of edges) {
            adjList[u].push(v);
            adjList[v].push(u);
        }
        return adjList;
    };

    // DFS to find all nodes in the same component
    const dfs = (node, visited, adjList) => {
        const stack = [node];
        let size = 0;
        
        while (stack.length > 0) {
            const current = stack.pop();
            if (!visited[current]) {
                visited[current] = true;
                size += 1;
                for (const neighbor of adjList[current]) {
                    if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                        stack.push(neighbor);
                    }
                }
            }
        }
        
        return size;
    };

    const adjList = buildAdjacencyList(n, edges);
    const visited = Array(n).fill(false);
    const componentSizes = [];

    // Find all components and their sizes
    for (let i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
        if (!visited[i]) {
            const size = dfs(i, visited, adjList);
            componentSizes.push(size);
        }
    }

    // Calculate the number of unreachable pairs
    let unreachablePairs = 0;
    let sumOfPreviousComponents = 0;

    for (const size of componentSizes) {
        unreachablePairs += size * (n - size - sumOfPreviousComponents);
        sumOfPreviousComponents += size;
    }

    return unreachablePairs;
}

// Example Usage:
const n = 6;
const edges = [[0, 2], [0, 3], [0, 4], [1, 2], [2, 5]];
console.log(countPairs(n, edges)); // Output: 4
```

## Time Complexity

- **Building adjacency list**: O(E), where E is the number of edges.
- **DFS traversal**: O(N + E), where N is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges.
- **Counting unreachable pairs**: O(C), where C is the number of connected components.

Overall, the total time complexity is **O(N + E)**, which is efficient for the given constraints.
