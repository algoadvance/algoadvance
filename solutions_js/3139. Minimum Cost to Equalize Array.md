[Leetcode 3139. Minimum Cost to Equalize Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3139)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array `arr` of `n` positive integers and you are also given an array `cost` of `n` positive integers where `cost[i]` is the cost of incrementing or decrementing `arr[i]` by `1`. Your task is to find the minimum cost to make all the elements of the array equal.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Is there a constraint on the size of the array `n`?**
   - Yes, typical constraints found in LeetCode problems.
   
2. **Will the `cost` array always have the same length as the `arr` array?**
   - Yes, both `arr` and `cost` will always have the same length `n`.

3. **Can the elements in the `arr` array be equal initially?**
   - Yes, elements can be initially equal.

### Strategy

1. **Understand the Cost Function:** We need to make all elements in `arr` equal while minimizing the cost. Each change of one unit in `arr[i]` costs `cost[i]`.

2. **Choose a Target Element `x`:** Let's define `x` as the target element. The goal is to transform every element in `arr` to the value `x`.

3. **Calculate Total Cost for a Given `x`:**
   - For a given target value `x`, the total cost to transform the array is calculated as:
     \[
     \text{total\_cost} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} |arr[i] - x| \times cost[i]
     \]

4. **Optimize Target Element `x`:** The optimal value of `x` lies within the range of the elements in `arr`. We can use a median-based approach or a binary search to find this optimal value.

### Code

Let's implement this step-by-step in JavaScript.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} arr
 * @param {number[]} cost
 * @return {number}
 */
function minCost(arr, cost) {
    // Helper function to compute the total cost for a given target value `x`
    const computeCost = (x) => {
        let totalCost = 0;
        for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
            totalCost += Math.abs(arr[i] - x) * cost[i];
        }
        return totalCost;
    };

    // Initialize binary search boundary
    let left = Math.min(...arr);
    let right = Math.max(...arr);

    while (left < right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        let costMid = computeCost(mid);
        let costNext = computeCost(mid + 1);

        if (costMid > costNext) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid;
        }
    }

    return computeCost(left);
}
```

### Strategy Explanation

1. **Binary Search Approach:**
    - We use binary search within the range of minimum and maximum values of `arr` to find the optimal target value `x`.
    - For each midpoint, calculate the total cost for `mid` and `mid + 1`. Depending on which cost is lower, adjust the search boundaries (`left` and `right`).

2. **Compute Cost Function:**
    - The `computeCost` function calculates the total cost for converting all elements to a specific target value `x`.

### Time Complexity

- **Cost Computation:** Each cost computation takes `O(n)` time.
- **Binary Search:** The binary search runs in `O(log(max(arr) - min(arr)))`.

Thus, the total time complexity is `O(n * log(max(arr) - min(arr)))`.

This solution is efficient given the problem constraints and ensures that we minimize the cost to equalize the array elements.
