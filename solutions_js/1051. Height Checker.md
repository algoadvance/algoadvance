[Leetcode 1051. Height Checker](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1051)
## Problem Statement

A school is trying to take an annual photo of all the students. The students are asked to stand in a single file line in non-decreasing order by height. Unfortunately, not all the students do this correctly, and some students are not in the correct positions.

You are given an integer array `heights` representing the current order that the students are standing in. Each integer represents a student's height. You need to write a function that returns the minimum number of students that must move in order for all students to be standing in non-decreasing order by height.

Example:
```
Input: heights = [1,1,4,2,1,3]
Output: 3
```
Explanation: 
Students with heights 4, 3, and the last 1 are not standing in the right positions.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for student heights?**
   - The heights are typically within a small, reasonable range of positive integers.
   
2. **Can the array be empty?**
   - No, there is at least one student.

3. **Are the students' heights distinct?**
   - No, the heights may have duplicates.

## Strategy

1. Sort the given `heights` array to get the expected order.
2. Compare the sorted array with the original array.
3. Count how many elements are different between the original array and the sorted array to determine the number of students that must move.

## Code

```javascript
function heightChecker(heights) {
    // Create a sorted version of the heights array
    const sortedHeights = [...heights].sort((a, b) => a - b);

    // Count the number of differences between the original and sorted arrays
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < heights.length; i++) {
        if (heights[i] !== sortedHeights[i]) {
            count++;
        }
    }

    return count;
}

// Example usage:
const heights = [1, 1, 4, 2, 1, 3];
console.log(heightChecker(heights)); // Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Sorting the array**: This takes \(O(n \log n)\) time.
2. **Comparing the arrays**: This takes \(O(n)\) time.

Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\). The space complexity is \(O(n)\) due to the additional array used for sorting.
