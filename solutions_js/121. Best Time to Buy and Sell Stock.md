[Leetcode 121. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l121)
### Problem Statement:

You are given an array `prices` where `prices[i]` is the price of a given stock on the `i-th` day.

You want to maximize your profit by choosing a single day to buy one stock and choosing a different day in the future to sell that stock.

Return the maximum profit you can achieve from this transaction. If you cannot achieve any profit, return 0.

### Clarifying Questions:

1. Can the prices array be empty?
   - No, the array will have at least one element.
2. Are all prices guaranteed to be non-negative?
   - Yes, all prices are non-negative integers.
3. Can I buy and sell on the same day?
   - No, you must buy on one day and sell on a different day later.

### Strategy:

1. We will use a single-pass algorithm with two variables:
   - `minPrice`: to keep track of the minimum price seen so far.
   - `maxProfit`: to keep track of the maximum profit that can be achieved based on the minimum price seen so far.

2. As we iterate through the array:
   - If we find a price lower than `minPrice`, we update `minPrice`.
   - Calculate the potential profit with the current price and update `maxProfit` if this profit is greater than the previous `maxProfit`.

3. We will return the `maxProfit` after finishing the iteration.

### Code:

```javascript
function maxProfit(prices) {
    let minPrice = Infinity;
    let maxProfit = 0;

    for (let price of prices) {
        if (price < minPrice) {
            minPrice = price;
        } else if (price - minPrice > maxProfit) {
            maxProfit = price - minPrice;
        }
    }

    return maxProfit;
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) — We only pass through the array once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1) — We use a constant amount of extra space.

### Explanation:

- Initialize `minPrice` to a very high number (`Infinity`) and `maxProfit` to 0.
- Iterate through the prices array:
  - For each price, check if it is lower than `minPrice`. If so, update `minPrice`.
  - Calculate the potential profit (current price - `minPrice`). If this is greater than `maxProfit`, update `maxProfit`.
- Return `maxProfit` after the loop. If no profit can be made, `maxProfit` will be 0.
