[Leetcode 1379. Find a Corresponding Node of a Binary Tree in a Clone of That Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1379)
## Problem Statement

Given two binary trees original and cloned and given a reference to a node target in the original tree.

The cloned tree is a copy of the original tree.

Return a reference to the same node in the cloned tree.

Note that you are not allowed to modify any of the trees or the target node and the answer must be a reference to a node in the cloned tree.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: tree = [7,4,3,null,null,6,19], target = 3
Output: 3
Explanation: In all examples the original and cloned trees are shown. 
The target node is a node with value 3. 
Note that you should return a reference to the node with the same value 3 in the cloned tree.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q: Can the value of the target node be unique in the tree?**
   - A: Yes, since the problem is with references, and they are unique, the value might not be the unique identifier.

2. **Q: What should be returned if an invalid target is given?**
   - A: This scenario is not specified; assume the input will always be valid as per the problem.

3. **Q: Do both trees (original and cloned) have the same structure?**
   - A: Yes, the cloned tree is an exact copy of the original tree.

## Strategy

1. Use Depth First Search (DFS) to traverse both trees simultaneously.
2. When the node in the original tree matches the target node, return the corresponding node in the cloned tree.

### Steps

1. Define a function `getTargetCopy`.
2. Use DFS. Start traversing both trees from the root.
3. For each node in the original tree:
    - Compare it to the target node.
    - If it matches, return the node from the cloned tree.
    - If not, recurse into both left and right subtrees.
4. Ensure to handle base cases, such as null nodes.

This approach ensures that we cover all nodes while maintaining the same structure of both trees during traversal.

## Code

```javascript
// Definition for a binary tree node.
function TreeNode(val) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = this.right = null;
}

/**
 * @param {TreeNode} original
 * @param {TreeNode} cloned
 * @param {TreeNode} target
 * @return {TreeNode}
 */
var getTargetCopy = function(original, cloned, target) {
    // Helper function to perform DFS
    const dfs = (origNode, cloneNode) => {
        if (origNode === null) return null;
        if (origNode === target) return cloneNode;
        
        // Recursively search in left subtree
        let leftResult = dfs(origNode.left, cloneNode.left);
        if (leftResult !== null) return leftResult;

        // Recursively search in right subtree
        return dfs(origNode.right, cloneNode.right);
    };

    return dfs(original, cloned);
};
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity for this approach is **O(n)**, where `n` is the number of nodes in the tree. This is because, in the worst case, we might need to visit every node in the tree.

The space complexity is **O(h)**, where `h` is the height of the tree. This is due to the stack space usage in the recursive DFS calls.
