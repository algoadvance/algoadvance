[Leetcode 1686. Stone Game VI](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1686)
## Problem Statement

Alice and Bob take turns playing a game, with Alice starting first.

There are `n` stones in a pile. On each player's turn, they can take 1, 2, or 3 stones from the pile. The player who takes the last stone wins.

Given an integer `n`, return `true` if Alice can win the game assuming both players play optimally, otherwise return `false`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Clarification on `n` (number of stones):**
   - Is `n` always a positive integer?
   - What is the maximum value of `n` for this problem?

2. **Game Play:**
   - Players cannot skip their turn and must take 1, 2, or 3 stones.
   - We assume both players are highly skilled and play optimally.

Since the rules specified that taking the last stone wins the game, we can infer the following:
- If the remaining number of stones before Aliceâ€™s turn is a multiple of 4, Alice will lose because no matter how many stones she takes (1, 2, or 3), Bob can always adjust to leave Alice with another multiple of 4.

## Strategy

1. **Determine Base Cases:**
   - For `n = 1, 2, 3`, Alice can win by taking all stones.
   - For `n = 4`, Alice will lose because she will leave 1, 2, or 3 stones for Bob, who can then take all remaining stones.

2. **Generalize for larger `n`:**
   - Analyze the state of the game for `n % 4 == 0`. If `n` is a multiple of 4, Alice loses. Otherwise, Alice can always win by adjusting her move to force Bob into a losing position.

## Code

```javascript
function canWinNim(n) {
    // Alice wins if the number of stones is not a multiple of 4
    return n % 4 !== 0;
}

console.log(canWinNim(1)); // true
console.log(canWinNim(4)); // false
console.log(canWinNim(7)); // true
console.log(canWinNim(8)); // false
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is O(1):
- The solution determines the outcome by computing `n % 4`, which is a constant-time operation.

This makes the algorithm very efficient even for large values of `n`.
