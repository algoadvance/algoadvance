[Leetcode 2780. Minimum Index of a Valid Split](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2780)
## Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums` of length `n`.

We call an index `i` in the range `0 <= i < n - 1` a **valid split** if the following conditions are satisfied:
- `nums[0] + nums[1] + ... + nums[i] == nums[i+1] + nums[i+2] + ... + nums[n-1]`

Return *the minimum index* of a **valid split**. If no valid split exists, return `-1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Array Size:** What is the size range of the array? 
   - **Constraints:** `2 <= nums.length <= 10^5`

2. **Integer Range:** What are the range of integers in the array? 
   - **Constraints:** `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9`

3. **Edge Cases:** What are the edge cases that need consideration?
   - Arrays of minimum length i.e., 2 elements.
   - Arrays where the only valid split is at the very start or end.

## Strategy

To determine a valid split, we need to check whether there exists an index `i` such that the sum of the elements from the start to `i` (inclusive) is equal to the sum of the elements from `i + 1` to the end.

### Steps:

1. **Pre-compute Total Sum:**
   - Calculate the total sum of the array.
   
2. **Iterate with Running Sum:**
   - Initialize `leftSum` to zero.
   - Iterate through the array and compute `leftSum` incrementally.
   - For each index `i`, compute `rightSum = totalSum - leftSum - nums[i]`.
   - Check if `leftSum` is equal to `rightSum` and return index `i` if true.

3. **Edge Conditions:**
   - If no valid split index is found return `-1`.

### Pseudocode:

1. Initialize `totalSum` to the sum of the entire array.
2. Initialize `leftSum` to `0`.
3. Loop through each element (excluding the last one since the split is `i < n-1`):
   - Add the current element to `leftSum`.
   - Compute `rightSum = totalSum - leftSum`.
   - Check if `leftSum` is equal to `rightSum`.
   - If equal, return the current index `i`.
4. If no valid split is found, return `-1`.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number}
 */
var minimumIndexOfValidSplit = function(nums) {
    let totalSum = nums.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
    let leftSum = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
        leftSum += nums[i];
        if (leftSum === totalSum - leftSum) {
            return i;
        }
    }

    return -1; // No valid split found
};
```

## Time Complexity
- **O(n):** The algorithm traverses the list twice, once to compute the initial total sum, and once to find the valid split. Therefore, the overall time complexity is linear with respect to the number of elements in the array.
