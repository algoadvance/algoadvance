[Leetcode 963. Minimum Area Rectangle II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l963)
## Problem Statement

Given a set of points in the plane, determine the minimum area of any rectangle formed from these points, with sides not necessarily parallel to the x and y axes.

- Each point is represented by a pair of integers \([x, y]\).
- A rectangle is a set of four distinct points \((p1, p2, p3, p4)\) such that:
  - They form four right angles.
- If there isn't any rectangle formed, return 0.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum number of points that can be provided?**
   - The problem guarantees a reasonable constraint on the number of points (for example, up to 500 points).

2. **Should the points be treated as integers only or floating points as well?**
   - The provided points should be treated as integers only.

3. **Is the output required to be an exact value or can it be an approximate value?**
   - The output should be an exact value representing the minimum area of any rectangle.

## Strategy

1. **Identify All Possible Diagonals**: Utilize the property that the diagonals of a rectangle bisect each other.
2. **Track Midpoints and Slopes**: Use a map to maintain all pairs of points, tracking midpoints and slopes of potential rectangles.
3. **Calculate Rectangle Area**: For each valid grouping (same midpoint and slope), calculate the area of the potential rectangle and track the minimum area observed.

## Code

```javascript
function minAreaFreeRect(points) {
    const n = points.length;
    const pointSet = new Set(points.map(pt => pt.toString()));
    let minArea = Infinity;

    // Helper function to compute distance square between two points
    const distanceSquared = (p1, p2) => 
        (p1[0] - p2[0]) ** 2 + (p1[1] - p2[1]) ** 2;

    // Helper function to get mid point
    const getMidPoint = (p1, p2) => 
        [(p1[0] + p2[0]) / 2, (p1[1] + p2[1]) / 2];

    // Iterate over all pairs of points
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {

            for (let k = 0; k < n; k++) {
                if (k === i || k === j) continue;
                for (let l = k + 1; l < n; l++) {
                    if (l === i || l === j) continue;

                    const p1 = points[i];
                    const p2 = points[j];
                    const p3 = points[k];
                    const p4 = points[l];

                    const mid1 = getMidPoint(p1, p2);
                    const mid2 = getMidPoint(p3, p4);

                    // Check if midpoints are the same and distances match (ensures 90 degrees)
                    if (mid1[0] === mid2[0] && mid1[1] === mid2[1]) {
                        const dist1 = distanceSquared(p1, p2);
                        const dist2 = distanceSquared(p3, p4);

                        if (dist1 === dist2) {
                            const area = Math.sqrt(distanceSquared(p1, p3)) * Math.sqrt(distanceSquared(p1, p4));
                            if (area < minArea) {
                                minArea = area;
                            }
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return minArea === Infinity ? 0 : minArea;
}

// Example Usage
console.log(minAreaFreeRect([
  [1,2],[2,1],[1,0],[0,1]
]));  // Output: 2
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: O(1) for initializing variables.
- **Nested Loops**: O(n^4) where `n` is the number of points. This is due to having four nested loops to iterate over all point pairs.

This approach ensures all combinations are considered but may not be optimal for large datasets. Improvements might include geometric properties or hashing for efficient pairing.
