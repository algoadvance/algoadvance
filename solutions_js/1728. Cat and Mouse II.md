[Leetcode 1728. Cat and Mouse II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1728)
### Problem Statement:

You are given a `rows x cols` matrix representing a maze with the following characters:
- 'C' represents the Cat's starting position.
- 'M' represents the Mouse's starting position.
- 'F' represents food.
- '.' represents an open cell.
- '#' represents a wall.

The Cat and Mouse play a game where the Mouse tries to reach the food while the Cat tries to catch the Mouse. In each move, the Mouse and the Cat can move to any adjacent cell (up, down, left, right). The Mouse moves first, and then the Cat moves.

Return `true` if the Mouse can escape to the food without being caught by the Cat, and `false` otherwise. Both the Mouse and the Cat start at the same time.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. What are the constraints for rows and cols? (e.g., size limits)
2. Do we consider edge wrapping or is movement strictly within the bounds of the matrix?
3. Are there any special rules about which cells they can or cannot move into beyond walls?

Assuming that:
- The grid has no edge wrapping.
- Movement is strictly within the provided matrix.
- The Mouse cannot move into walls, similar to the Cat.

### Strategy:

This problem can be modeled as a two-player game with alternating moves, and we can solve it using a Breadth-First Search (BFS) or Dynamic Programming (DP) approach to simulate the movements of the Cat and Mouse.

**Steps:**
1. Parse the matrix to locate the positions of the Cat, Mouse, and Food.
2. Use BFS to simulate the movements of the Mouse to find all possible states where it could potentially reach the food.
3. Simulate the Catâ€™s movements to determine if it can catch the Mouse before it reaches the food.
4. Determine if there exists a sequence of moves where the Mouse can reach the food without being caught by the Cat.

### Code:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string[]} grid
 * @return {boolean}
 */
var canMouseWin = function(grid) {
    const rows = grid.length;
    const cols = grid[0].length;
    let catStart, mouseStart, food;

    // Find positions of Cat, Mouse and Food
    for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
        for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
            if (grid[r][c] === 'C') catStart = [r, c];
            if (grid[r][c] === 'M') mouseStart = [r, c];
            if (grid[r][c] === 'F') food = [r, c];
        }
    }
    
    const moves = [[1,0], [0,1], [-1,0], [0,-1]];
    
    // BFS for reachable state
    const bfs = function(start) {
        const queue = [start];
        const visited = Array(rows).fill(null).map(() => Array(cols).fill(false));
        visited[start[0]][start[1]] = true;
        let step = 0; // Number of steps taken
        
        while (queue.length > 0) {
            const size = queue.length;
            for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
                const [r, c] = queue.shift();
                
                // If the current position is food, Mouse wins
                if (grid[r][c] === 'F') return true;
                
                for (const [dr, dc] of moves) {
                    const nr = r + dr;
                    const nc = c + dc;
                    
                    if (nr >= 0 && nr < rows && nc >= 0 && nc < cols && grid[nr][nc] !== '#' && !visited[nr][nc]) {
                        visited[nr][nc] = true;
                        queue.push([nr, nc]);
                    }
                }
            }
            step++;
        }
        return false;
    }
    
    // Check if Mouse can reach Food first
    const canMouseReachFood = bfs(mouseStart);
    const canCatReachMouse = bfs(catStart);
    
    return canMouseReachFood && !canCatReachMouse;
};

// Example Usage
const grid = [
    ["C",".",".","#","F"],
    [".","#",".",".","."],
    [".",".",".",".","M"]
];

console.log(canMouseWin(grid)); // Expected Output: Would depend on the grid settings.
```

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution mainly depends on the BFS traversal of the grid, which is \(O(\text{rows} \times \text{cols})\) for each BFS. In the worst case, we may have to run BFS for both the Mouse and the Cat, making the overall complexity \(O(2 \times \text{rows} \times \text{cols})\), which simplifies to \(O(\text{rows} \times \text{cols})\).

Please adjust the example and edge cases as needed for your testing purposes.
