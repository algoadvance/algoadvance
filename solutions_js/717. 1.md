### Problem Statement

717. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters

We have two special characters:
- The first character can be represented by one bit `0`.
- The second character can be represented by two bits (`10` or `11`).

Given a binary array `bits` that ends with a `0`, determine if the last character must be a one-bit character or a two-bit character.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** What are the constraints on the length of the `bits` array?
   - **A:** The length of `bits` is between 1 and 1000.

2. **Q:** Can `bits` contain any characters other than `0` and `1`?
   - **A:** No, `bits` contains only `0` and `1`.

3. **Q:** Is it guaranteed that the array ends with a `0`?
   - **A:** Yes, it is guaranteed that the array ends with a `0`.

### Strategy

To determine if the last character is a one-bit character (`0`), we need to traverse the array from the beginning, interpreting the bits according to the given rules:
- If we encounter a `0`, it represents a one-bit character.
- If we encounter a `1`, it represents the start of a two-bit character, and we should skip the next bit.

We can proceed as follows:
1. Start from the beginning of the array.
2. Iterate through the array, processing each bit:
   - If the current bit is `0`, move to the next bit.
   - If the current bit is `1`, skip the next bit since it is part of a two-bit character.
3. If the last `0` we encounter during the iteration coincides with the end of the array, then the last character is a one-bit character.

This approach ensures that we correctly identify whether the last `0` is part of a one-bit or two-bit character sequence.

### Code

```javascript
var isOneBitCharacter = function(bits) {
    let i = 0;
    while (i < bits.length - 1) {
        // If current bit is 1, it's the start of a 2-bit character
        if (bits[i] == 1) {
            i += 2;
        } else {
            // Current bit is 0, it's a 1-bit character
            i += 1;
        }
    }
    // If we stopped at the last bit, it's a 1-bit character
    return i === bits.length - 1;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the `bits` array. We are processing each bit exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1). We are using a constant amount of space regardless of the input size.

This solution efficiently determines if the last character is a one-bit character by iterating through the array while adhering to the provided character encoding rules.
