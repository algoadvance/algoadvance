[Leetcode 1681. Minimum Incompatibility](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1681)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. You are required to divide `nums` into `k` subsets so that:

1. The compatibility of a subset is defined as the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in that subset.
2. The incompatibility of the distribution is the sum of the compatibilities of all subsets.

Return the minimum possible incompatibility sum. If it is not possible to divide `nums` into `k` subsets, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `nums` contain duplicate elements?**
   - Yes, `nums` can contain duplicate elements.

2. **What is the maximum size of `nums` and the value of `k`?**
   - According to constraints, `nums.length` can go up to 16 and `k` will be such that the length of each subset (nums.length / k) is at least 1 and at most nums.length.

3. **Should all subsets be of equal size?**
   - Yes, each subset should be of size `nums.length / k`.

### Strategy

1. **Problem Restatement:** 
   - Divide `nums` into `k` equally-sized subsets such that the sum of the differences between the max and min in each subset is minimized. If such a division isn't possible, return -1.

2. **Initial Thoughts:**
   - Given the constraints, a brute-force approach may not be feasible. We will use a backtracking-based approach combined with memoization to manage the complexity.

3. **Detailed Strategy:**
   - Use bitmasking to represent the subsets.
   - For each subset, calculate its compatibility only if it doesn't contain duplicate elements.
   - Use dynamic programming to keep track of the minimum compatibility sum found so far.

### Code

```javascript
const minIncompatibility = (nums, k) => {
    const n = nums.length;
    if (n % k !== 0) return -1;
    const subsetSize = n / k;
    
    const incompatibility = (subset) => {
        let min = Infinity, max = -Infinity;
        let seen = new Set();
        for (let num of subset) {
            if (seen.has(num)) return Infinity;
            min = Math.min(min, num);
            max = Math.max(max, num);
            seen.add(num);
        }
        return max - min;
    };

    const dp = new Map();
    const ALL_USED = (1 << n) - 1;

    const dfs = (usedBits) => {
        if (usedBits === ALL_USED) return 0;

        if (dp.has(usedBits)) return dp.get(usedBits);

        let result = Infinity;
        
        for (let i = 0; i < n; ++i) {
            if ((usedBits & (1 << i)) === 0) {
                let subset = [];
                for (let j = i; j < n; ++j) {
                    if ((usedBits & (1 << j)) === 0) {
                        subset.push(nums[j]);
                        if (subset.length === subsetSize) {
                            let newBits = usedBits;
                            for (let num of subset) {
                                newBits |= (1 << nums.indexOf(num));
                            }
                            result = Math.min(result, incompatibility(subset) + dfs(newBits));
                            break;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }

        dp.set(usedBits, result);
        return result;
    };

    const minSum = dfs(0);
    return minSum === Infinity ? -1 : minSum;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Overall Complexity:**
  - The backtracking with memoization approach will have a time complexity of O(2^n * n) where `n` is the length of `nums`, due to the subset generation and compatibility checking, which are polynomial.

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity will be O(2^n) due to the dynamic programming map that can store up to 2^n states.

This approach ensures the problem can be solved within reasonable time for the given constraints.
