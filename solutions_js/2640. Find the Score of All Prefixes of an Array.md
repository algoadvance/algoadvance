[Leetcode 2640. Find the Score of All Prefixes of an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2640)
## Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` of length `n`. The **score** of a prefix of `nums` is defined as the sum of the prefix multiplied by its length. More formally, if `prefix` is the first `i` elements of `nums`, then the **score** of `prefix` is `(prefix sum) * i`. 

Return an array `result` of length `n` where `result[i]` equals the score of the prefix ending at index `i`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the array contain negative numbers?**
   - Yes, the array may contain negative numbers.
   
2. **What is the range of the values in the array?**
   - The array values can be any integers.
   
3. **What is the maximum length of the array `n`?**
   - The constraint will be consistent with typical LeetCode limits, usually up to \(10^5\) elements.
   
4. **Do we have any constraints regarding the time complexity?**
   - Given the array length, an efficient solution (preferably O(n) time complexity) is likely required.

## Strategy

1. **Initialize variables**: Create a result array to store the scores of prefixes. Initialize prefix sum as 0.
2. **Iterate through `nums`**: Keep a running sum (`prefixSum`) for the prefixes.
3. **Calculate score**: For each element at index `i`, the prefix score is calculated as `prefixSum * (i + 1)` where `i + 1` is the length of the prefix.
4. **Store result**: Store the calculated score in the result array.
5. **Return the result array**.

This strategy ensures we handle each element of the array exactly once, achieving linear time complexity.

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[]}
 */
function findPrefixScore(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    const result = new Array(n);
    let prefixSum = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        prefixSum += nums[i];
        result[i] = prefixSum * (i + 1);
    }
    
    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: The provided solution iterates through the array once, each step involving constant time operations. Hence, the time complexity is **O(n)**.
- **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is **O(n)** due to the storage of the result array.
