[Leetcode 2289. Steps to Make Array Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2289)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, you need to return the minimum number of steps to make the array non-decreasing. In one step, you can pick any index `i` where `0 <= i < nums.length` and set `nums[i]` to any value.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the size range of the array?**
   - The array size can range from a few elements to thousands, which can affect the efficiency of the solution.

2. **Are there any constraints on the values within the array?**
   - Typically integer ranges; we should confirm whether there are any boundaries that we need to consider for the values.

3. **Is the array allowed to contain duplicates?**
   - Confirm whether duplicates are valid inputs as they might affect the strategy.

4. **Should we return the minimum number of steps or is there a specific way to define the steps?**
   - Ensure the output is the minimum number of steps to convert the array into a non-decreasing order.

## Code

Here is the code for solving the problem:

```javascript
function minStepsToMakeNonDecreasing(nums) {
    const n = nums.length;
    const dp = Array(n).fill(1);
    let maxSteps = 1;
    
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < i; j++) {
            if (nums[i] >= nums[j]) {
                dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1);
            }
        }
        maxSteps = Math.max(maxSteps, dp[i]);
    }
    
    return n - maxSteps;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(minStepsToMakeNonDecreasing([5, 1, 3, 2, 3, 4, 1])); // Output: 3
```

## Strategy

1. **Dynamic Programming Approach**:
    - Use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` is the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence ending with `nums[i]`.
    - Initialize `dp` with 1s because the minimum length of the non-decreasing subsequence ending at any element is at least 1 (the element itself).
    - Iterate over the array and update `dp` based on previously computed values.
    - Keep track of the maximum length of any non-decreasing subsequence found (`maxSteps`).

2. **Calculate Steps**:
    - The minimum steps required to convert the array can be determined by subtracting the length of the longest non-decreasing subsequence from the total number of elements in the array.
    - This is because the elements that are not part of this longest subsequence need to be "changed" to fit the non-decreasing order.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is **O(n^2)** where `n` is the size of the input array.
- The outer loop runs `n` times.
- The inner nested loop also runs `n` times in the worst case.

The space complexity is **O(n)** due to the storage used for the `dp` array.
