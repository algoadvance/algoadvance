[Leetcode 1040. Moving Stones Until Consecutive II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1040)
### Problem Statement:
You are given an array `stones` that represents the positions of stones in a horizontal line. We need to move the stones to make them consecutive. There are two possible values to compute:
1. The minimum number of moves required to make the stones consecutive.
2. The maximum number of moves required to make the stones consecutive.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Range of Input:** What are the constraints on the length of the `stones` array and the values within it?
   - **Answer:** Length of `stones` array can be up to 10^5 and stone positions values can be within the range 1 to 10^9.

2. **Duplicates Handling:** Is it possible for the stones positions to have duplicates?
   - **Answer:** No, each stone position is unique.

3. **Order of Stones:** Should the order of stones in the initial array matter?
   - **Answer:** No, only their positions matter, not the order.

4. **Return Type:** Should the function return the results as an array of two integers?
   - **Answer:** Yes, return an array where the first element is the minimum number of moves and the second element is the maximum number of moves.

### Strategy:
1. **Sort the Stones:** Start by sorting the array to easily find gaps between the stones.
2. **Max Moves Calculation:**
   - The maximum moves occur when you move stones from the ends inwards, so calculate the gaps at the extremes.
   - The formula to calculate max moves would be `max(stones[n-1] - stones[1] - (n-2), stones[n-2] - stones[0] - (n-2))`.
3. **Min Moves Calculation:**
   - Use a sliding window approach to determine the smallest possible window where all stones fit and are consecutive. 
   - For each possible window size, calculate the number of stones already within that window, and compute the minimum outside stones that need to be moved in.
   - Special case: If we only have one large gap, the minimum moves might have different calculations. Specifically, handle the case of 2-moves for edge cases.

### Code:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} stones
 * @return {number[]}
 */
 var numMovesStonesII = function(stones) {
    stones.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let n = stones.length;
    
    // Calculate maximum number of moves
    let maxMoves = Math.max(stones[n-1] - stones[1] - (n-2), stones[n-2] - stones[0] - (n-2));
    
    // Calculate minimum number of moves using sliding window
    let minMoves = Number.MAX_SAFE_INTEGER;
    let j = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        while (j + 1 < n && stones[j + 1] - stones[i] + 1 <= n) {
            j++;
        }
        let alreadyInPlace = j - i + 1;
        if (alreadyInPlace == n-1 && stones[j] - stones[i] + 1 == n-1) {
            minMoves = Math.min(minMoves, 2);
        } else {
            minMoves = Math.min(minMoves, n - alreadyInPlace);
        }
    }
    
    return [minMoves, maxMoves];
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Sorting:** O(n log n) due to the sort operation.
- **Sliding Window Calculation for Minimum Moves:** O(n), since each index is processed only a few times.
- **Overall Time Complexity:** O(n log n), dominated by the sorting step.
