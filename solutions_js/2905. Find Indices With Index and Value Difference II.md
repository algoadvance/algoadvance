[Leetcode 2905. Find Indices With Index and Value Difference II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2905)
## Problem Statement

You are given a list of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. Write a function that finds all indices `i` and `j` such that:

1. `i != j`
2. `|i - j| <= k`
3. `|nums[i] - nums[j]| <= k`

The function should return a list of tuples where each tuple contains the indices `(i, j)` that satisfy the conditions.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if no such indices are found?**
   - Return an empty list.

2. **Can the same index pair be repeated in the output?**
   - Typically, each unique pair can be listed, but indices should not be repeated, meaning (i, j) should be considered the same as (j, i).

3. **Is the order of indices important?**
   - For simplicity, maintain (i, j) where i < j to avoid duplicates.

## Strategy

1. **Iterate and Compare**: Use two nested loops to compare each element in the `nums` list against the other elements within the index range defined by `k`.
2. **Check Conditions**: For each pair `(i, j)`:
   - Ensure `i != j`.
   - Check if the absolute difference of indices `|i - j|` is within `k`.
   - Check if the absolute difference of values `|nums[i] - nums[j]|` is within `k`.
3. **Store Valid Indices**: Store the indices in a list if all conditions are met.

## Time Complexity

- The solution will use a nested loop to compare each pair of elements in the list, resulting in a time complexity of O(nÂ²).

## Code

```javascript
function findIndicesWithDifference(nums, k) {
    const result = [];
    
    // Length of the nums array
    const n = nums.length;
    
    // Iterate through all pairs (i, j)
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < n; j++) {
            if (Math.abs(i - j) <= k && Math.abs(nums[i] - nums[j]) <= k) {
                result.push([i, j]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Example usage:
const nums = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9];
const k = 2;
console.log(findIndicesWithDifference(nums, k));   // Example: might return [[0, 1], [1, 2], [2, 3], [3, 4]]
```

This code snippet defines a function `findIndicesWithDifference` that iterates through all possible pairs of indices `(i, j)` and checks the defined conditions. If conditions are met, it stores the pair in the `result` list. Finally, it returns the list of all valid index pairs.
