[Leetcode 1807. Evaluate the Bracket Pairs of a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1807)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` that contains some bracket pairs, i.e., `()` and they may contain a key that connects to a corresponding value in a `knowledge` dictionary. The task is to replace all keys present in `s` with their corresponding values from the knowledge dictionary. 

If a key is not present in the knowledge dictionary, replace it with a question mark (`?`).

You are given the string `s` and the `knowledge` array which contains elements of the form `[key, value]`.

### Example

**Input:**
```javascript
s = "(name)is(age)yearsold";
knowledge = [["name", "bob"], ["age", "two"]]
```

**Output:** 
```javascript
"bobistwoyearsold"
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are all keys guaranteed to be unique in the knowledge array?**
   - Yes, the keys in the knowledge array are unique.
 
2. **Will the string `s` always be valid with properly closed brackets?**
   - Yes, `s` will always contain properly balanced and closed bracket pairs.
  
3. **Is the `knowledge` array guaranteed to be non-empty?**
   - No. It might be empty and if no keys are found, they should be replaced with `?`.

### Strategy

1. **Parse the Input:** We will create a dictionary from the `knowledge` array to have quick access to the values using keys.
2. **Iterate through the String:** Use a pointer to traverse through the string while building the result string.
3. **Handle Brackets:** 
   - When encountering an opening bracket `(`, start to capture the key until the closing bracket `)`.
   - Once the key is extracted, look it up in the dictionary.
   - Replace it with the corresponding value or a `?` if the key does not exist.
4. **Construct the Result:** Concatenate characters or replacements to build the resulting string.

### Code

```javascript
var evaluate = function(s, knowledge) {
    const knowledgeMap = new Map(knowledge);
    let result = '';
    let key = '';
    let inBracket = false;

    for (let i = 0; i < s.length; i++) {
        const char = s[i];

        if (char === '(') {
            inBracket = true;
            key = '';
        } else if (char === ')') {
            inBracket = false;
            result += knowledgeMap.has(key) ? knowledgeMap.get(key) : '?';
        } else if (inBracket) {
            key += char;
        } else {
            result += char;
        }
    }

    return result;
};

// Example usage:
let s = "(name)is(age)yearsold";
let knowledge = [["name", "bob"], ["age", "two"]];
console.log(evaluate(s, knowledge)); // Output: "bobistwoyearsold"
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is **O(n + m)** where:
- **n** is the length of the input string `s`.
- **m** is the number of entries in the `knowledge` list.

Creating the `knowledgeMap` is **O(m)** and processing each character of the string `s` is **O(n)**.

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is **O(m + k)** where:
- **m** is the space used by the `knowledgeMap`.
- **k** is the additional space for holding keys and temporary variables.

This is efficient given the constraints of the problem.
