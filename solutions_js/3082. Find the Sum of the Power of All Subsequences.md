[Leetcode 3082. Find the Sum of the Power of All Subsequences](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3082)
## Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums`. A subsequence of `nums` is an array that can be derived from `nums` by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements.

Two subsequences `nums1` and `nums2` are different if there is some index `i` such that `nums1[i] != nums2[i]`.

For every subsequence, calculate the value of the minimum element in the subsequence and the maximum element in the subsequence, then take the difference between the two values to generate a power value for the subsequence.

Return the sum of all the power values for all possible subsequences of `nums`. Since the answer could be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Example:
```
Input: nums = [2, 3, 5]
Output: 19
Explanation: 
There are 7 subsequences: [2], [3], [5], [2, 3], [2, 5], [3, 5], [2, 3, 5]
The power values of the subsequences are (3-2), (5-2), (3-2), (5-3), and (5-2)
The sum of the power values is (3-2) + (5-2) + (3-2) + (5-3) + (5-2) = 19
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are the elements of `nums` always positive integers?
2. What should be returned if the input list is empty?
3. Are there constraints on the size of the input array `nums`?

## Strategy
1. **Sort the Array**: This simplifies the identification of minimum and maximum values in subsequences, making it easier to calculate the power values efficiently.
2. **Learn the Subsequences**: Each element will have some subsequences where it is the minimum and some where it is the maximum.
3. **Multiplicative Contribution**: Use the number of possible subsequences that can form from the left and right of each element to determine its power contribution.
4. **Modular Arithmetic**: Use modulo `10^9 + 7` to keep results within manageable limits.

### Code Implementation

```javascript
function sumOfPower(nums) {
    const MOD = 10**9 + 7;
    let n = nums.length;
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    let powerSum = 0;

    // To count number of subsequences where an element is the minimum and maximum,
    // we will use a power of 2.
    let pow2 = new Array(n).fill(1);
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        pow2[i] = (pow2[i - 1] * 2) % MOD;
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Contribution where nums[i] is the maximum element
        if (i > 0) {
            powerSum = (powerSum + nums[i] * (pow2[i] - 1)) % MOD;
        }
        // Contribution where nums[i] is the minimum element
        if (i < n - 1) {
            powerSum = (powerSum + nums[i] * (pow2[n - i - 1] - 1)) % MOD;
        }
    }

    return powerSum;
}
```

## Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: O(n log n)
- **Pre-computation**: O(n)
- **Summation Loop**: O(n)

Thus, the overall time complexity is **O(n log n)**, which is dominated by the sorting step.
