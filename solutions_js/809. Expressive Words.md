[Leetcode 809. Expressive Words](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l809)
### Problem Statement

We are given a string `s` and an array of strings `words`. Sometimes, when we type a string, the characters get repeated by accident. For example, unless we physically source control effort, a string like "heeellooo" might actually be the result of typing "hello" with the 'e' and 'o' keys held down.

Define a query word as "stretchy" forward a given stretchy string `s` if it can be made to match `s` by adding some number of extra characters.

Our task is to establish how many words from the array `words` are stretchy versus string `s`.

**Example:**
Given:
- `s = "heeellooo"`
- `words = ["hello", "hi", "helo"]`

Return `1`, since only "hello" can be extended to match `s`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Can characters in `words` have arbitrary repetitions, or should we only consider exact repetitions to form a stretchy word?
   - The characters in `words` should form `s` by exactly matching or expanding certain sequences to match the repetition count in `s`.

2. Are all characters in `words` and `s` lowercase English letters?
   - Yes, according to the problem.

3. What should be the output if none of the words match?
   - The output should be `0`.

4. What is the length range of `s` and the elements in `words`?
   - `s` will have a length in the range [1, 100]. `words` can contain up to 1000 words, each having a length in the range [1, 100].

### Strategy

1. **Group Characters and Count Repetitions**: Create a function to group `s` and each word in `words` by their consecutive character repetitions.
2. **Matching Groups**: Check if the grouped characters and their repetition counts in each word can be stretched to match `s`.
3. **Conditions for Stretching**:
   - For each character in the groups, if `s` has `n` repeated characters, `w` must have exactly `n` characters or between 1 to `n-1` if `n` â‰¥ 3.
   - If any condition fails, the word is not stretchy.

### Code

```javascript
function expressiveWords(s, words) {
    const group = (str) => {
        let res = [];
        let count = 1;
        for (let i = 1; i <= str.length; i++) {
            if (str[i] !== str[i - 1]) {
                res.push([str[i - 1], count]);
                count = 1;
            } else {
                count++;
            }
        }
        return res;
    };

    const sGroup = group(s);
    let count = 0;

    for (let word of words) {
        let wGroup = group(word);

        if (sGroup.length !== wGroup.length) continue;

        let stretchy = true;
        for (let i = 0; i < sGroup.length; i++) {
            if (sGroup[i][0] !== wGroup[i][0] || 
                (sGroup[i][1] < 3 && sGroup[i][1] !== wGroup[i][1]) ||
                (wGroup[i][1] > sGroup[i][1])) {
                stretchy = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        
        if (stretchy) count++;
    }

    return count;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Grouping characters**: O(L) where L is the length of string `s`.
- **Iterate through words**: O(N * M) where N is the number of words and M is the maximum length of a word in `words`.
- Thus, the overall time complexity: O(N * M).

With the given constraints, this solution should work efficiently.
