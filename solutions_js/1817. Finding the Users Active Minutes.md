[Leetcode 1817. Finding the Users Active Minutes](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1817)
## Problem Statement:
You are given the logs for users' actions in a system. The logs are represented as a 2D array where each entry is of the form `[user_id, minute]`. `user_id` represents the ID of the user and `minute` represents the minute at which the user was active. Multiple entries for the same user in the same minute should only count as a single active minute.

You are also given an integer `k` which represents the maximum number of minutes you need to consider. Your task is to find an array `result` of size `k` such that `result[i]` is the number of users that were active for exactly `i+1` minutes.

For example, if `k` is 5, you need to return a list of 5 elements where:
- result[0] is the number of users active for exactly 1 minute,
- result[1] is the number of users active for exactly 2 minutes, and so on till,
- result[4] is the number of users active for exactly 5 minutes.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. Can one user have multiple logs in the same minute? What should be considered in such case?
   - Yes, but only unique minutes per user should be considered.
2. Can the list of logs be empty?
   - Yes, it can be empty.
3. What is the range of values for `k`?
   - 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5
4. What is the range of values for `user_id` and `minute`?
   - 1 ≤ user_id, minute ≤ 10^9

## Strategy:
1. **Using Dictionary to Track User Activity**:
   - Use a dictionary `user_minutes` to track unique active minutes for each user.
2. **Count Active Minutes Per User**:
   - Iterate through the logs and populate the `user_minutes` dictionary ensuring each user ID maps to a set of unique minutes they were active.
3. **Calculate Frequency of Active Minutes**:
   - Use another dictionary `minutes_count` to count how many users were active for a certain number of unique minutes.
4. **Prepare the Result Array**:
   - Using the `minutes_count` dictionary, populate the result array of size `k`, ensuring indices map to the number of active minutes appropriately.

## Code:

```javascript
function findingUsersActiveMinutes(logs, k) {
    // Dictionary to track unique active minutes per user
    const userMinutes = {};

    // Populate userMinutes with sets of unique minutes of activity for each user
    for (const [user_id, minute] of logs) {
        if (!userMinutes[user_id]) {
            userMinutes[user_id] = new Set();
        }
        userMinutes[user_id].add(minute);
    }

    // Dictionary to count frequency of unique active minutes
    const minutesCount = {};

    // Populate minutesCount with active minutes frequency
    for (const minutes of Object.values(userMinutes)) {
        const uniqueMinutesCount = minutes.size;
        if (!minutesCount[uniqueMinutesCount]) {
            minutesCount[uniqueMinutesCount] = 0;
        }
        minutesCount[uniqueMinutesCount]++;
    }

    // Prepare the result array
    const result = new Array(k).fill(0);

    // Fill the result array based on minutesCount
    for (const [count, freq] of Object.entries(minutesCount)) {
        if (count - 1 < k) {
            result[count - 1] = freq;
        }
    }

    return result;
}

// Example Usage:
const logs = [
    [1, 1], [2, 2], [2, 3], [2, 3], [3, 4]
];
const k = 5;

console.log(findingUsersActiveMinutes(logs, k)); // Output should be [1, 1, 0, 1, 0]
```

## Time Complexity:
- **Processing Logs**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the logs array (to fill `userMinutes`).
- **Unique Minutes Count**: O(u), where `u` is the number of unique users (each user processes its set of unique active minutes).
- **Filling the Result**: O(k), since we initialize and fill a result array of size `k`.

Overall: The average time complexity is O(n + k), considering `n` can be substantially larger than `k` in most practical cases.
