[Leetcode 2586. Count the Number of Vowel Strings in Range](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2586)
## Problem Statement

You are given a string array `words` and two integers `left` and `right`. A string is a vowel string if it contains only vowels ('a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u'). Return the number of vowel strings `words[i]` such that `left <= i <= right`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Will the indices `left` and `right` always be valid, i.e., within the bounds of the `words` array?**
   - Yes, you can assume that `left` and `right` are valid indices such that `0 <= left <= right < words.length`.

2. **Can the `words` array contain empty strings?**
   - Yes, strings in the `words` array can be empty, although they wouldn't affect the result since an empty string does not contain any vowels and hence is not a vowel string.

3. **Is the input strictly lowercase?**
   - Yes, assume all strings are lowercase as well as all the characters and input constraints are clearly specified.

## Strategy

1. **Iterate** through the `words` array from index `left` to `right`.
2. For each string in this range, **check** if all characters are vowels:
   - Define a set of vowels for easy lookup.
   - Check each character for inclusion in this set.
3. **Count** the number of strings that meet the criteria.

## Code

```javascript
function isVowelString(word) {
    const vowels = new Set(['a', 'e', 'i', 'o', 'u']);
    for (let char of word) {
        if (!vowels.has(char)) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
}

function countVowelStringsInRange(words, left, right) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = left; i <= right; i++) {
        if (isVowelString(words[i])) {
            count++;
        }
    }
    return count;
}

// Example usage
const words = ["e", "aeiou", "apple", "io", "iou"];
const left = 1;
const right = 4;
console.log(countVowelStringsInRange(words, left, right)); // Output should be 2
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of the **`isVowelString`** function is O(L) where L is the length of the string being checked, because it potentially checks each character.
- The **`countVowelStringsInRange`** function iterates over `right - left + 1` elements in the `words` array. For each string, it calls `isVowelString`.
- Hence, the overall time complexity is **O((right - left + 1) * L)** in the worst case.

This solution leverages straightforward iteration and set lookups, ensuring the implementation is efficient given typical constraints.
