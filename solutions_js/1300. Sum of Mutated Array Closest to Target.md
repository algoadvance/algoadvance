[Leetcode 1300. Sum of Mutated Array Closest to Target](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1300)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `arr` and an integer target, you must choose a value from the array's range and mutate all the elements of `arr` to become that chosen value. Return the minimum value equal to or greater than such chosen value such that the sum of the mutated array is closest to the target.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the array contain negative numbers?
   - No, the array consists of non-negative integers.
   
2. Can the target be negative?
   - No, the target will be a non-negative integer.
   
3. What if there is more than one possible answer?
   - You can return any one of the possible answers.

4. What is the size of the array we can expect?
   - The array size can go up to `10^4` and values up to `10^5`.

## Strategy

To solve this problem, you can use a binary search approach to find the optimal value for mutation:

1. **Calculate the Sum Function**: Write a helper function to compute the sum of the mutated array, given a particular mutation value.
2. **Binary Search**: Use binary search to find the optimal value from the minimum value in the array to the maximum value in the array.
3. **Evaluate Closest Sum**: During the binary search, continually update the value that minimizes the absolute difference with the target.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Sorting Step**: Start by sorting the array. This will help in efficiently applying binary search.
2. **Binary Search Initialization**: Initialize binary search range from 0 to the maximum value in the array.
3. **Binary Search Execution**: For each midpoint of the search range, calculate the possible sum of the mutated array and compare it with the target.
4. **Decision Making**: Adjust the search boundaries based on whether the current sum is less than or greater than the target.

## Code

```javascript
function findBestValue(arr, target) {
    arr.sort((a, b) => a - b);
    let left = 0;
    let right = arr[arr.length - 1];
    
    const calculateSum = (value) => {
        let sum = 0;
        for (const num of arr) {
            sum += Math.min(num, value);
        }
        return sum;
    }
    
    let bestValue = left;
    let minDiff = Infinity;

    while (left <= right) {
        const mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        const currentSum = calculateSum(mid);
        const currentDiff = Math.abs(currentSum - target);
        
        if (currentDiff < minDiff || (currentDiff === minDiff && mid < bestValue)) {
            minDiff = currentDiff;
            bestValue = mid;
        }
        
        if (currentSum < target) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    
    return bestValue;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach can be broken down as follows:

1. **Sorting**: `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the length of the array.
2. **Binary Search**: Since binary search is `O(log M)`, where `M` is the range between the maximum and minimum of the array.
    - For each midpoint calculation, we traverse the array to calculate the sum, which takes `O(n)`.
   
Overall, the time complexity is `O(n log n) + O(n log M)`. Given the constraints, this approach should efficiently handle the problem within the provided limits.

With careful implementation, this method should efficiently find the best value to minimize the absolute difference relative to the target.
