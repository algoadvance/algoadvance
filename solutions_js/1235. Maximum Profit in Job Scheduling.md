[Leetcode 1235. Maximum Profit in Job Scheduling](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1235)
## Problem Statement

You are given `n` jobs, where each job is represented by `startTime[i]`, `endTime[i]`, and `profit[i]`. You're tasked with finding the maximum profit subset of non-overlapping jobs.

- `startTime[i]` and `endTime[i]` are the start and end times of the i-th job.
- `profit[i]` is the profit of the i-th job.

Return the maximum profit you can obtain.

**Example:**

```
Input: startTime = [1,2,3,3], endTime = [3,4,5,6], profit = [50,10,40,70]
Output: 120
Explanation: The subset of jobs for max profit can be {job 1, job 4} [50 + 70 = 120] or {job 1, job 3} [50 + 40 = 90], and job 4 [70]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. Are the arrays `startTime`, `endTime`, and `profit` guaranteed to be of the same length?
2. Should the start time of one job be considered as non-overlapping if it coincides with the end time of the previous job?

## Strategy

We'll use dynamic programming and binary search to solve this problem efficiently:

1. **Sort Jobs:** First, we create a list of jobs with their start time, end time, and profit, and then sort them by their end times.
2. **DP Array:** We'll use a dynamic programming array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum profit we can get by scheduling jobs from the 0th job to the ith job.
3. **Binary Search:** For each job, we'll use binary search to find the latest job that does not overlap with the current job. This will provide the maximum profit by taking non-overlapping jobs up to that point plus the current job's profit.
4. **Transition:** We'll either take the current job or skip it to maximize the profit at each step.

## Solution Code

```javascript
function jobScheduling(startTime, endTime, profit) {
    const n = profit.length;
    const jobs = [];
  
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        jobs.push([startTime[i], endTime[i], profit[i]]);
    }

    // Sort jobs by end time
    jobs.sort((a, b) => a[1] - b[1]);

    const dp = new Array(n).fill(0);
    dp[0] = jobs[0][2]; // Initial profit is the profit of the first job

    // Helper function for binary search
    function binarySearch(jobs, index) {
        let low = 0, high = index - 1;
        while (low <= high) {
            const mid = Math.floor((low + high) / 2);
            if (jobs[mid][1] <= jobs[index][0]) {
                if (jobs[mid + 1][1] <= jobs[index][0]) {
                    low = mid + 1;
                } else {
                    return mid;
                }
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return -1;
    }

    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        let profitIncludingCurrent = jobs[i][2];
        const l = binarySearch(jobs, i);
        if (l != -1) {
            profitIncludingCurrent += dp[l];
        }
        dp[i] = Math.max(dp[i - 1], profitIncludingCurrent);
    }

    return dp[n - 1];
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Sorting:** \(O(n \log n)\) due to the sorting step.
- **Binary Search:** Each binary search takes \(O(\log n)\) and we do it for each of the \(n\) jobs, so it's \(O(n \log n)\).
- **Overall:** Combining these, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \log n)\).

This solution efficiently calculates the maximum profit for non-overlapping jobs using sorting, dynamic programming, and binary search.
