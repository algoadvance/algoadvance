[Leetcode 509. Fibonacci Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l509)
### Problem Statement
The Fibonacci numbers, commonly denoted as `F(n)`, form a sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, such that each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from 0 and 1. That is,
```
F(0) = 0, F(1) = 1
F(n) = F(n - 1) + F(n - 2), for n > 1.
```
Given `n`, calculate `F(n)`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input constraints**: What is the maximum value of `n` that we should consider?
   - The problem typically assumes an integer `n` in the range `0 <= n <= 30`.
2. **Non-integer Input?**: Do we expect non-integer input for `n`?
   - No, we'll assume `n` is always an integer.
3. **Negative Input?**: Do we need to handle cases where `n` is negative?
   - For this problem, we assume `n` is always non-negative.

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use several approaches including:
1. **Recursive Approach**: Directly implement the Fibonacci relation as a recursive function.
2. **Dynamic Programming (Memoization)**: Use an array to store intermediate results to avoid recalculating them.
3. **Iterative Approach**: Use a loop and keep track of the last two Fibonacci numbers to build up to `n`.

Given the constraints, we can choose the iterative approach for its simplicity and efficiency:

### Code
```javascript
function fib(n) {
    if (n <= 0) return 0;
    if (n === 1) return 1;

    let a = 0, b = 1;
    for (let i = 2; i <= n; i++) {
        let c = a + b;
        a = b;
        b = c;
    }
    return b;
}

// Example usage
console.log(fib(0));  // 0
console.log(fib(1));  // 1
console.log(fib(2));  // 1
console.log(fib(3));  // 2
console.log(fib(4));  // 3
console.log(fib(10)); // 55
console.log(fib(30)); // 832040
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the iterative approach is O(n) because we have one loop running from `2` to `n`.

### Space Complexity
The space complexity is O(1) because we are only using a constant amount of extra space to store the last two Fibonacci numbers.
