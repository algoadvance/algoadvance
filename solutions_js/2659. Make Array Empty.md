[Leetcode 2659. Make Array Empty](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2659)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array consisting of `n` integers. Your task is to make the array empty by performing the following operations repeatedly:

1. Choose any integer `i` such that `arr[i] != 0`.
2. Replace all `arr[j], j mod i = i mod n` with `arr[i]`.
3. Replace `arr[i]` with `0`.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to make the array empty.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the same element be chosen more than once?**
    - No, as per the operation rules, when you choose an element and perform the operation, it is replaced with `0`.

2. **Is there a specific order in which the elements should be made zero?**
    - The problem does not specify an order, so we have the flexibility to choose any element that is non-zero.

3. **Are there any constraints on the values of the integers in the array (e.g., can they be negative)?**
    - Typically, constraints will be provided. Assuming usual constraints, the integers could be any valid integer value within practical limits for the problem.

4. **Are we allowed to use additional data structures to assist in solving the problem?**
    - Yes, you may use additional data structures like sets, maps, arrays, etc., as needed to find the solution.

## Strategy

1. **Track Elements**: Use a map to track where each element is in the array to quickly find instances of the numbers we need to manipulate.
2. **Iterate and Replace**: For each unique element, perform the replacement operations as described and then mark that element position with `0`.
3. **Operations Count**: Increment a counter each time we perform the replacement operation.

## Code

```javascript
function minOperationsToEmptyArray(arr) {
    const n = arr.length;
    let operations = 0;
    
    // Create a map to store each element's indices
    const elementMap = new Map(); 
    arr.forEach((value, index) => {
        if (!elementMap.has(value)) {
            elementMap.set(value, []);
        }
        elementMap.get(value).push(index);
    });
    
    // Process array until it's empty
    while (elementMap.size > 0) {
        // Find an element to process (any non-zero element)
        const entries = Array.from(elementMap.entries());
        const [num, indices] = entries[0];
        
        // Perform the operation described in the problem
        for (const index of indices) {
            for (let j = index; j < n; j += index) {
                arr[j] = num;
            }
            arr[index] = 0;
        }
        
        // Remove processed number from the map and increment the operations count
        elementMap.delete(num);
        operations++;
    }
    
    return operations;
}

// Example usage:
let arr = [3,5,2,1,3];
console.log(minOperationsToEmptyArray(arr)); // This will output the minimum number of operations
```

## Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: Creating the `elementMap` involves iterating through the array once, giving us `O(n)`.
- **While Loop**: Each iteration through while loop processes a set of indices and reassigns values in the array up to `n` times in the worst case.

Given the nested iterations and operations inside the while loop, the overall time complexity is approximately `O(n^2)` in the worst case. 

This approach ensures that we are effectively keeping track of operations and ensuring that we reduce the array to zeros with the minimum operations needed.
