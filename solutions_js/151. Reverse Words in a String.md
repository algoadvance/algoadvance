[Leetcode 151. Reverse Words in a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l151)
### Problem Statement:

Given an input string `s`, reverse the order of the **words**.

A **word** is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in `s` will be separated by at least one space.

Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.

**Note**:

- A word appears as a sequence of non-space characters.
- The input string may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between words.
- The return string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: s = "the sky is blue"
Output: "blue is sky the"

Input: s = "  hello world  "
Output: "world hello"

Input: s = "a good   example"
Output: "example good a"
```

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q:** Can the input contain only spaces?
   - **A:** Yes, in that case, the output should be an empty string.
   
2. **Q:** Are there character limits for the input string?
   - **A:** The input string can be up to 10^4 characters long.
   
3. **Q:** Should we consider punctuation as part of the words?
   - **A:** Yes, punctuation should be treated as part of the words.

### Strategy:

1. **Trimming the String:** First, remove any leading and trailing spaces from the input string.
2. **Splitting the String:** Split the trimmed string into words using spaces as delimiters. By default, `split` will handle multiple spaces correctly.
3. **Reversing the Array:** Reverse the array of words.
4. **Joining the Words:** Join the array of words back into a single string with a space as the separator.

### Code:

```javascript
function reverseWords(s) {
    // Step 1: Trim leading and trailing spaces
    let trimmedStr = s.trim();
    
    // Step 2: Split the trimmed string by spaces
    let wordsArray = trimmedStr.split(/\s+/);
    
    // Step 3: Reverse the array of words
    let reversedArray = wordsArray.reverse();
    
    // Step 4: Join the reversed array into a single string
    return reversedArray.join(' ');
}
```

### Explanation:

1. **Trim the String:** `s.trim()` removes unwanted leading and trailing spaces.
2. **Split the String:** `s.split(/\s+/)` splits the string into words, handling multiple spaces correctly.
3. **Reverse the Array:** `wordsArray.reverse()` reverses the order of the words.
4. **Join the Words:** `reversedArray.join(' ')` joins the reversed array into a single string with a single space as the delimiter.

### Time Complexity:

- **Trimming the string:** O(n), where n is the length of the string.
- **Splitting the string:** O(n), where n is the length of the string.
- **Reversing the array:** O(m), where m is the number of words.
- **Joining the array:** O(n), where n is the total length of all words combined.

Overall, the time complexity is O(n), which is efficient given the constraints.
