[Leetcode 2521. Distinct Prime Factors of Product of Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2521)
## Problem Statement
Given an array of positive integers `nums`, return the number of distinct prime factors in the product of the elements of `nums`.

### Example:
```text
Input: nums = [2, 4, 3, 7, 10]
Output: 4
Explanation: The distinct prime factors of the product 1680 are the prime factors of 1680.

Example 2:
Input: nums = [10, 11, 12, 13]
Output: 5
Explanation: The distinct prime factors are 2, 3, 5, 11, and 13.
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of the values in the array `nums`?
2. Can the array contain duplicate numbers?
3. What is the maximum length of the array?
4. Are we restricted by memory usage, especially considering the size of the product?

## Strategy
1. **Prime Factorization Function**: Develop a helper function to find all the prime factors of a given number.
2. **Set for Distinct Primes**: Use a Set to store the distinct prime factors.
3. **Iterate through the Array**: For each number in the array, find its prime factors and add them to the Set.
4. **Return the Count**: The size of the Set will be the answer as it stores only unique prime factors.

### Steps:
1. Create a function to check for prime factors.
2. Loop through each number in array `nums` and find its prime factors.
3. Use a Set to store unique prime factors.
4. Return the size of the Set.

## Code
```javascript
// Helper function to calculate prime factors
function getPrimeFactors(n) {
    const factors = new Set();
    // Check for number of 2s that divide n
    while (n % 2 === 0) {
        factors.add(2);
        n = n / 2;
    }
    // n must be odd at this point, so a skip of 2 (i.e. i = i + 2) can be used
    for (let i = 3; i <= Math.sqrt(n); i += 2) {
        // While i divides n, add i and divide n
        while (n % i === 0) {
            factors.add(i);
            n = n / i;
        }
    }
    // This condition is to check if n is a prime number greater than 2
    if (n > 2) {
        factors.add(n);
    }
    return factors;
}

// Main function
function distinctPrimeFactors(nums) {
    const distinctPrimes = new Set();
    for (const num of nums) {
        const primes = getPrimeFactors(num);
        for (const prime of primes) {
            distinctPrimes.add(prime);
        }
    }
    return distinctPrimes.size;
}

// Test Cases
console.log(distinctPrimeFactors([2, 4, 3, 7, 10])); // Output: 4
console.log(distinctPrimeFactors([10, 11, 12, 13])); // Output: 5
```

## Time Complexity
1. **Prime Factor Calculation**: For each number, finding its prime factors is approximately O(sqrt(n)).
2. **Overall Complexity**: If there are `m` numbers in the array, the total time complexity will be approximately O(m * sqrt(k)), where `k` is the largest number in the array `nums`.

Note that in the worst case, if `nums` contains very large prime numbers, the complexity can be quite high. However, this approach should work efficiently for reasonably sized inputs within expected constraints.
