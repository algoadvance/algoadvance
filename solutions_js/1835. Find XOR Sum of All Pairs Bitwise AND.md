[Leetcode 1835. Find XOR Sum of All Pairs Bitwise AND](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1835)
## Problem Statement
Given two integer arrays `arr1` and `arr2`, the XOR sum of all pairs bitwise AND is defined as:
- `arr1[i] & arr2[j]` for each pair `(i, j)` where `0 <= i < arr1.length` and `0 <= j < arr2.length`
- The sum of all these values, but with XOR instead of addition.

Return the XOR sum of all pairs bitwise AND.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Are there any constraints on the sizes of `arr1` and `arr2`?
    - Constraints are `1 <= arr1.length, arr2.length <= 10^5`.
2. What are the constraints on the values within `arr1` and `arr2`?
    - Constraints are `0 <= arr1[i], arr2[j] <= 10^9`.
3. Can the input arrays be empty?
    - No, the problem guarantees that the lengths of the arrays are at least 1.

## Strategy
Given the potential sizes of the arrays, an O(n * m) solution will be computationally expensive and infeasible. We need an optimized approach.

### Key Insight:
Using properties of XOR and AND operations:
- XOR is distributive over AND: \((A \& B) \oplus (A \& C) = A \& (B \oplus C)\)

We can leverage this insight to break down the problem:
1. Compute the XOR of all elements in `arr2` (let's call this `xor_arr2`).
2. Iterate through `arr1`, and for each element `a` in `arr1`, compute the AND with `xor_arr2`, and XOR these results together.

### Steps:
1. Compute `xor_arr2 = arr2[0] ^ arr2[1] ^ ... ^ arr2[m-1]`, where `m` is the length of `arr2`.
2. Initialize `result` to 0.
3. For each element `a` in `arr1`, compute `a & xor_arr2` and XOR this result with `result`.
4. Return `result`.

### Time Complexity:
- Computing `xor_arr2` takes O(m) time.
- Iterating through `arr1` and performing the AND and XOR operations takes O(n) time.
Thus, the overall time complexity of this approach is O(n + m), which is efficient.

## Code
```javascript
function getXORSum(arr1, arr2) {
    // Compute the XOR of all elements in arr2
    let xor_arr2 = arr2.reduce((acc, num) => acc ^ num, 0);
    
    // Initialize the result
    let result = 0;

    // Iterate through arr1, compute the AND with xor_arr2, and XOR with result
    for (let num of arr1) {
        result ^= (num & xor_arr2);
    }

    return result;
}

// Example usage:
// console.log(getXORSum([1,2,3], [6,5])); // Output depends on the example case
```

In this code, the `reduce` method efficiently computes the XOR of all elements in `arr2`, and the subsequent loop computes the final XOR sum for all pairs. This provides a solution with efficient time complexity suitable for large input sizes.
