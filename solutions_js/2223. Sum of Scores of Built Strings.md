[Leetcode 2223. Sum of Scores of Built Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2223)
### Problem Statement

The problem is: Given a lexicographically smallest string `s` of length `n`, return the total sum of scores of all non-empty strings that can be built using all permutations of `s`.

A score of a string is the number of pairs (i, j) (i ≤ j) such that the substring from s[i] to s[j] is lexicographically smallest.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Should the input string always be composed of lowercase English letters only?
2. Is there any constraint on the length `n` of the input string `s`?
3. Are we considering only distinct permutations of the string, or can the permutations include repeated sequences?

(Covered in the problem, assumed lowercase letters and constraints on `n` will be logical within typical competitive programming ranges.)

### Strategy

The solution to this problem involves understanding the concept of lexicographical order and how permutations of a string can generate substrings that need to be evaluated for their scores.

1. **Sort the string (if not given in sorted order):** The initial step is to ensure that the string `s` is the lexicographically smallest permutation of the characters.
   
2. **Understand permutations:** Generating all permutations of the string and evaluating them when necessary.

3. **Dynamic Programming/Z-function approach:** Use advanced string-matching techniques to identify and score substrings’ lexicographical properties efficiently.

### Code

Here is a solution using the Z-function to calculate the score of each substring. The Z-function for a string is an array of the same length made up of the lengths of the longest substrings that start from each position and are also prefixes of the string.

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {number}
 */
function sumScores(s) {
    const n = s.length;
    const z = new Array(n).fill(0);
    z[0] = n;  // The whole string is a prefix of itself

    let l = 0, r = 0;  // Initialize the window [l, r]

    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (i <= r) {
            z[i] = Math.min(r - i + 1, z[i - l]);
        }
        while (i + z[i] < n && s[z[i]] === s[i + z[i]]) {
            z[i]++;
        }
        if (i + z[i] - 1 > r) {
            l = i;
            r = i + z[i] - 1;
        }
    }

    // Sum up all elements in the Z array to get the total score of all substrings
    return z.reduce((a, b) => a + b, 0);
}

// Example usage:
const s = "abc"; // Expected output: 3
console.log(sumScores(s)); 
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of the provided solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the input string `s`. This is because the Z-function computation is linear, efficiently processing each index of the string in constant time operations.
