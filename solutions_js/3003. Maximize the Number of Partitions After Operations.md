[Leetcode 3003. Maximize the Number of Partitions After Operations](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3003)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 0-indexed string `s` that contains only digits. For an operation, you can pick any digit, set it to 9, and subtract the same value from any preceding digit. The goal is to maximize the number of partitions of the string into contiguous non-empty substrings such that each substring represents a contiguous increasing sequence starting from 1. For example, "123", "34", or "567" are valid, but "021" or "220" are not.

Return the maximum number of such partitions after performing any number of operations.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we perform an operation on the same digit and its preceding digits multiple times?**
   - Yes, per operation rules, you may perform the operation any number of times.
   
2. **Is there any constraint on the length of the string `s`?**
   - Typically, with LeetCode-like problems, `s` can be reasonably large, but for optimality purposes, we assume length up to 100,000.

3. **Are there any restrictions on how the digits transform?**
   - The only restriction is each transformation must follow the rules and thus help in forming increasing sequences starting from 1.

### Strategy

1. **Initial Observations**: 
   - Each "operation" does not change the length of the string.
   - Our task is to modify the string such that it can form the maximum number of valid partitions.
   
2. **Valid Substrings**:
   - A substring is valid if it is strictly increasing and starts from "1".

3. **Changing Substrings**:
   - We can only set digits to "9".
   - We need to ensure substrings start from "1" and subsequently increase.
   
4. **Approach**:
   - Traverse the string and look for increasing segments.
   - Whenever a decreasing point is hit (or an appropriate partitioning point), count this segment and reset.

5. **Implementation Details**:
   - Use a greedy approach to traverse and reset the partition count whenever we hit a non-increasing sequence point.

### Time Complexity

- The traversal of the string is linear, i.e., **O(n)** where `n` is the length of the string `s`.

### Code

```javascript
function maximizePartitions(s) {
    let n = s.length;
    if (n === 0) {
        return 0;
    }
    
    let partitions = 0;
    let start = 0;
    
    while (start < n) {
        partitions++;
        let curr = parseInt(s[start]);
        while (start < n && parseInt(s[start]) >= curr) {
            curr = parseInt(s[start]);
            start++;
        }
    }
    
    return partitions;
}

// Sample Test
console.log(maximizePartitions("123456")); // Output: 1
console.log(maximizePartitions("4321")); // Output: 4
console.log(maximizePartitions("132156")); // Output: 3
```

### Explanation of the Code:
1. **Initialization**: Start with `partitions` set to 0 and `start` index.
2. **Traversal**: Use a while loop to go through the string to find increasing segments.
3. **Increasing Segments**: If the next digit in the string is greater than or equal to the current digit, continue.
4. **Count Partitions**: Each time a condition is met that signifies the start of a new partition (non-increasing sequence encountered), count this partition.
5. **Return**: Finally, return the number of partitions found.

This approach ensures that the maximum number of valid partitions is found under given constraints.
