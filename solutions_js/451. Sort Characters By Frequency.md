[Leetcode 451. Sort Characters By Frequency](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l451)
## Problem Statement
Given a string `s`, sort it in decreasing order based on the frequency of its characters. The frequency of a character is the number of times it appears in the string.

Return the sorted string. If there are multiple answers, any valid one will do.

### Examples:
- Example 1: 
  ```javascript
  Input: s = "tree"
  Output: "eert"
  Explanation:
  'e' appears twice while 'r' and 't' both appear once.
  So 'e' must appear before both 'r' and 't'.
  Therefore "eetr" is also a valid answer.
  ```
- Example 2:
  ```javascript
  Input: s = "cccaaa"
  Output: "aaaccc"
  Explanation:
  Both 'a' and 'c' appear three times, so "cccaaa" is also a valid answer.
  Note that "cacaca" is incorrect, as the same characters must be together.
  ```

- Example 3:
  ```javascript
  Input: s = "Aabb"
  Output: "bbAa"
  Explanation:
  "bbaA" is also a valid answer, but "Aabb" is incorrect.
  Note that 'A' and 'a' are treated as two different characters.
  ```

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Case Sensitivity**: Should the function consider uppercase and lowercase characters as distinct?
   - Yes, uppercase and lowercase characters should be treated as distinct.
2. **Input Constraints**: What are the constraints on string length and characters?
   - The string length \( |s| \) is between \( 1 \) and \( 5 \times 10^5 \). The string consists of printable ASCII characters.

## Strategy
1. **Frequency Map**: First, count the frequency of each character in the string using a hash map.
2. **Bucket Sort**: Use an array where the index represents frequencies and each element at that index is a list of characters with that frequency.
3. **Output Construction**: Construct the output string by iterating over the bucket array from the highest frequency to the lowest.

By using a bucket sort approach, we can efficiently group characters by their frequencies, which simplifies the process of constructing the final string in the desired order.

### Steps:
1. **Count Characters**: Traverse the string and count the frequency of each character.
2. **Bucket Sort**: Utilize an array to collect characters based on their frequency.
3. **Build Result**: Iterate through the frequency array in reverse (from high to low) and build the result string.

### Time Complexity
- Counting characters: \(O(n)\)
- Building the bucket array: \(O(n)\)
- Constructing the result: \(O(n)\)
- Overall: \(O(n)\)

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @return {string}
 */
var frequencySort = function(s) {
    const freqMap = new Map();
    
    // Step 1: Count the frequency of each character.
    for (const char of s) {
        freqMap.set(char, (freqMap.get(char) || 0) + 1);
    }
    
    // Step 2: Bucket sort characters by frequency.
    // Create the buckets array, index is the frequency.
    const buckets = Array.from({ length: s.length + 1 }, () => []);
    
    for (const [char, freq] of freqMap.entries()) {
        buckets[freq].push(char);
    }
    
    // Step 3: Build the result string from the buckets.
    let result = '';
    
    // Iterate from highest frequency to lowest.
    for (let i = buckets.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
        for (const char of buckets[i]) {
            result += char.repeat(i);
        }
    }
    
    return result;
};
```

This function sorts the characters by their frequency, with the most frequent characters appearing first, using a combination of a frequency map and bucket sort. The final result is built by concatenating characters from the highest frequency bucket to the lowest.
