[Leetcode 39. Combination Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l39)
## Problem Statement

The problem is asking us to find all unique combinations in a given array `candidates` where the candidate numbers sum to a given target number `target`. Each number in `candidates` may be used an unlimited number of times in the combination. The solution set must not contain duplicate combinations.

**Example:**

```
Input: candidates = [2,3,6,7], target = 7
Output: [[7],[2,2,3]]
```

**Constraints:**

- All elements in the candidates array are distinct.
- 1 <= candidates.length <= 30
- 1 <= candidates[i] <= 200
- 1 <= target <= 500

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the candidates array be empty?**
   - No, per constraints the array has at least one element.
   
2. **Are all numbers in the candidates array positive?**
   - Yes, per constraints all numbers are positive.

3. **Should the solution set contain unique combinations only?**
   - Yes, and combinations are considered the same if they have the same numbers regardless of order.

## Strategy

1. **Backtracking Approach:**
   - We'll use backtracking to explore all potential combinations.
   - We can start from any candidate and try to build the combination recursively.
   - We'll keep a running total and a current combination list.
   - If the running total exceeds the target, we backtrack.
   - If the running total equals the target, we store the current combination.
   - Weâ€™ll sort and deduplicate results automatically because we won't revisit previous choices as the candidates list is provided in ascending order (or we can sort it initially if it's not).

## Code

```javascript
function combinationSum(candidates, target) {
    const result = [];
    
    function backtrack(remainingTarget, combo, start) {
        if (remainingTarget < 0) return; // If the accumulated sum exceeds target
        if (remainingTarget === 0) { // If the exact target is reached
            result.push([...combo]);
            return;
        }
        
        for (let i = start; i < candidates.length; i++) {
            combo.push(candidates[i]);
            backtrack(remainingTarget - candidates[i], combo, i); // Not i + 1 because we can reuse the same element
            combo.pop();
        }
    }
    
    candidates.sort((a, b) => a - b); // Optional: sort to optimize or ensure order
    backtrack(target, [], 0);
    
    return result;
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is difficult to assess precisely due to the combinatorial nature of the problem, but here's a rough estimate:

- **Time Complexity:** O(2^t), where `t` is the target value.
  - This exponential complexity arises because, in the worst-case scenario, we may end up exploring all subsets of the candidates' list due to the combinations being repeated.

- **Space Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the target value divided by the smallest candidate value.
  - This arises from the maximum depth of recursion which would occur if we repeatedly subtract the smallest number from the target.

This solution should work efficiently within the provided constraints (target <= 500 and candidates <= 30).
