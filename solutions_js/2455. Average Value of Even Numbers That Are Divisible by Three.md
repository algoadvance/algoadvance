[Leetcode 2455. Average Value of Even Numbers That Are Divisible by Three](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2455)
### Problem Statement
Given an array of integers `nums`, return the average value of even numbers that are divisible by three. If there are no such integers, return 0.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Range**: What is the range of integers in the array `nums`? 
   - **Assumption**: The values can be any integer within the constraints of JavaScript integer limits.
2. **Array Length**: What is the length of the array `nums`?
   - **Assumption**: The array can have any length from 0 to 10^5.
3. **Output Format**: Should the average be a floating-point number, integer, or does it depend on the numbers?
   - **Assumption**: We should return a floating-point result or an integer where appropriate.

### Strategy
1. **Filter Numbers**: First, filter out the numbers in `nums` that are both even and divisible by 3.
2. **Compute Sum and Count**: Compute the sum and count of the filtered numbers.
3. **Calculate Average**: Calculate and return the average. If no numbers meet the criteria, return 0.

### Code
```javascript
function averageValue(nums) {
    // Step 1: Filter even numbers divisible by 3
    let filteredNums = nums.filter(num => num % 6 === 0);

    // Step 2: Calculate sum and count
    let sum = filteredNums.reduce((acc, num) => acc + num, 0);
    let count = filteredNums.length;

    // Step 3: Calculate and return the average
    return count === 0 ? 0 : sum / count;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Filter Even & Divisible by 3**: We use the modulo operation to check if a number is divisible by 6 (`num % 6 === 0`). This ensures that the number is both even and divisible by 3.
2. **Sum and Count**: We use `reduce` to calculate the sum of the filtered array and `length` property to count the filtered numbers.
3. **Return Value**: If the count is 0 (i.e., no numbers meet the criteria), we return 0. Otherwise, we return the sum divided by the count.

### Time Complexity
- **Filtering**: O(n), where n is the length of the array.
- **Sum Calculation**: O(n) in the worst case if all numbers were even and divisible by 3.
- **Overall**: O(n) due to linear passes for filtering and summing the array elements.
