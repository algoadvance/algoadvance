## Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, count the total number of digit `1` appearing in all non-negative integers less than or equal to `n`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can `n` be negative or zero?**
   - The problem specifies non-negative integers, so `n` will always be greater than or equal to zero.

2. **What is the range of `n`?**
   - Typically, in coding problems involving counting digits, `n` can be quite large, often up to 10^9.

3. **What should be returned?**
   - The function should return a single integer representing the count of digit `1` appearing in all non-negative integers up to and including `n`.

## Strategy

1. **Understanding the Pattern:**
   - We need to count the number of times the digit '1' appears at each digit place (ones, tens, hundreds, etc.).
   - For each digit place (10^i), we calculate the number of complete cycles of 1s in that digit place and the number of 1s contributed by partial cycles.

2. **Approach:**
   - Iterate over each digit place (units, tens, hundreds, etc.) and count contributions of the digit '1' to the total count.
   - Use mathematical calculations to determine how often a '1' appears at each place.

3. **Break it Down:**
   - For each digit place `10^i`:
     - Compute the current place's value.
     - Compute the higher and lower parts of the number relative to the current place.
     - Calculate the contribution of '1' at this place.

4. **Implementation Steps:**
   - Initialize a counter for the result.
   - Use a loop to iterate through each digit place by increasing powers of 10.
   - Compute contributions for each place value and accumulate the result.

## Code

```javascript
function countDigitOne(n) {
    let count = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i <= n; i *= 10) {
        const divider = i * 10;
        // Higher part of the number
        const high = Math.floor(n / divider);
        // Lower part of the number
        const low = n % i;
        // Current digit
        const digit = Math.floor((n % divider) / i);
        
        if (digit > 1) {
            count += (high + 1) * i;
        } else if (digit == 1) {
            count += high * i + (low + 1);
        } else {
            count += high * i;
        }
    }
    return count;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:**
  - The function iterates over each digit place up to `n`, so the number of iterations is proportional to the number of digits in `n`.
  - This results in a time complexity of O(log10(n)).

- **Space Complexity:**
  - The space complexity is O(1) because the algorithm only uses a few extra variables and the space required doesn't scale with input size.

With this strategy and implementation, you can efficiently count the number of '1's in the range from 0 to `n`.
