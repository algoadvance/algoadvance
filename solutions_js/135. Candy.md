[Leetcode 135. Candy](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l135)
## Problem Statement

There are `n` children standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value given in the integer array `ratings`.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

1. Each child must have at least one candy.
2. Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.

Return the minimum number of candies you need to have to distribute the candies to the children.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can the ratings array contain negative values or zero?
   - No, ratings are positive integers.
   
2. What should be the output if the input list `ratings` is empty?
   - The output should be 0 candies if the input list is empty.

3. Can two children have the same rating?
   - Yes, two children can have the same rating. In this case, they can have the same amount of candies as long as they satisfy the conditions.

## Strategy

1. We can solve the problem in two passes – left to right and right to left.
2. Initialize a candies array where each child gets at least one candy.
3. Traverse from left to right:
   - For every child, if the current child’s rating is higher than the previous child’s rating, give one more candy than the previous child.
4. Traverse from right to left:
   - For every child, if the current child’s rating is higher than the next child’s rating, give one more candy than the next child.
5. Take the maximum between the current and calculated candy counts at each step.
6. Sum up the values in the candies array to get the minimum number of candies required.

## Code

Here is the JavaScript implementation for the described strategy:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} ratings
 * @return {number}
 */
var candy = function(ratings) {
    if (ratings.length === 0) return 0;
    
    const n = ratings.length;
    const candies = Array(n).fill(1);
    
    // Left to right
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (ratings[i] > ratings[i - 1]) {
            candies[i] = candies[i - 1] + 1;
        }
    }
    
    // Right to left
    for (let i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (ratings[i] > ratings[i + 1]) {
            candies[i] = Math.max(candies[i], candies[i + 1] + 1);
        }
    }
    
    // Summing all the candies and returning the result
    return candies.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + curr, 0);
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: \(O(n)\) where \(n\) is the number of children. We are iterating through the `ratings` array twice.
- **Space Complexity**: \(O(n)\) due to the extra `candies` array.

This solution efficiently calculates the minimum number of candies needed while adhering to the problem's constraints.
