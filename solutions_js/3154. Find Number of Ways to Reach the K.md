[Leetcode 3154. Find Number of Ways to Reach the K](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3154)
### Problem Statement

There are `k` stairs, and at each stair, you can climb either `1`, `2`, or `3` steps. Your goal is to determine the number of different ways you can reach the `k-th` stair starting from the 0th stair (ground level). The input will be an integer `k` representing the total number of steps, and the output should be an integer representing the number of ways to reach the `k-th` stair.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Constraints:**
   - What is the maximum value for `k`?
   - Are there any performance considerations we need to be aware of?

2. **Input Validation:**
   - Can `k` be negative?
   - Is `k` guaranteed to be an integer?

3. **Base Cases:**
   - What are the base cases for `k = 0`, `k = 1`, `k = 2`, and `k = 3`?

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can utilize dynamic programming. The idea is to use a bottom-up approach to build a solution for reaching the `k-th` stair, based on known solutions for smaller values. 

We'll define `dp[i]` as the number of ways to reach the i-th stair. The recursive relation would be:
\[ \text{dp}[i] = \text{dp}[i-1] + \text{dp}[i-2] + \text{dp}[i-3] \]

Where:
- `dp[i-1]` represents taking one step from the (i-1)-th stair.
- `dp[i-2]` represents taking two steps from the (i-2)-th stair.
- `dp[i-3]` represents taking three steps from the (i-3)-th stair.

### Code

```javascript
function waysToReachKthStair(k) {
    // Base cases
    if (k < 0) return 0;
    if (k == 0) return 1;
    if (k == 1) return 1;
    if (k == 2) return 2;
    if (k == 3) return 4;

    // Initialize the dp array
    let dp = new Array(k + 1).fill(0);
    
    // Fill the base cases
    dp[0] = 1; // 1 way to be on the ground floor
    dp[1] = 1; // 1 way to reach the first stair
    dp[2] = 2; // "1+1" and "2"
    dp[3] = 4; // "1+1+1", "1+2", "2+1", and "3"
   
    // Fill the dp array using the recursive relation
    for (let i = 4; i <= k; i++) {
        dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] + dp[i-3];
    }
    
    // The result for the k-th step
    return dp[k];
}

// Example usage:
console.log(waysToReachKthStair(4)); // Outputs 7
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(k)\), since we're computing the values for all stairs from 0 to k.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(k)\), for storing the `dp` array.

This solution efficiently computes the number of ways to reach the `k-th` stair considering all possible ways to get to each intermediate stair.
