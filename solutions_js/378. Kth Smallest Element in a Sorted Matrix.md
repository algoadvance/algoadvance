[Leetcode 378. Kth Smallest Element in a Sorted Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l378)
### Problem Statement

Given an `n x n` matrix where each of the rows and columns is sorted in ascending order, find the kth smallest element in the matrix.

You have to complete the following function signature:

```javascript
var kthSmallest = function(matrix, k) {
    // your code here
};
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Size**:
   - What are the constraints on `n`? (Typical constraints are `1 <= n <= 300`)
   
2. **Value Range**:
   - What are the ranges of the values in the matrix? (Typically, values could range from `-10^9 to 10^9`).

3. **Output**:
   - Do we assume k is always valid (1 ≤ k ≤ n^2)?

For the sake of solving this problem, we will assume typical constraints: a square matrix of size `1 <= n <= 300` and the kth value is always valid.

### Strategy

1. **Binary Search on Value Range**:
   - We can use binary search on the value range to find the kth smallest element.
   - First, identify the minimum (`min_val`) and maximum (`max_val`) values in the matrix.
   - Perform a binary search between `min_val` and `max_val`:
     - For each middle value `mid`, count the number of elements in the matrix that are less than or equal to `mid`.
     - Adjust the search range based on the count.

2. **Counting Elements < x Efficiently**:
   - To count the elements ≤ `x` efficiently, utilize the sorted property of the matrix:
     - Start from the bottom-left or top-right corner and move accordingly (e.g., for bottom-left, if the current element is ≤ `x`, move right; if > `x`, move up).

### Code

Here's how we can implement the above strategy:

```javascript
var kthSmallest = function(matrix, k) {
    const n = matrix.length;
    
    let left = matrix[0][0];
    let right = matrix[n - 1][n - 1];
    
    while (left < right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        if (countLessEqual(matrix, mid) < k) {
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid;
        }
    }
    
    return left;
};

var countLessEqual = function(matrix, x) {
    const n = matrix.length;
    let count = 0;
    let row = n - 1;
    let col = 0;
    
    while (row >= 0 && col < n) {
        if (matrix[row][col] <= x) {
            count += row + 1;
            col++;
        } else {
            row--;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
};
```
### Time Complexity

- **Binary Search (`left` to `right`) complexity**: `O(log(max_val - min_val))`
- **Counting elements ≤ `x` complexity**: `O(n)`, as we traverse at most `2n` elements (either moving right or up)
- **Total complexity**: `O(n log(max_val - min_val))`. Given typical constraints, this approach is efficient.

This solution leverages the properties of the sorted matrix to efficiently count the elements and zero in on the kth smallest element using binary search.
