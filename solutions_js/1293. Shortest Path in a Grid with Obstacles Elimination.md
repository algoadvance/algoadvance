[Leetcode 1293. Shortest Path in a Grid with Obstacles Elimination](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1293)
### Problem Statement
You are given a `m x n` grid where each cell in the grid can either be empty (represented by `0`) or contain an obstacle (represented by `1`). You can move up, down, left, or right from one cell to another. 

Your task is to find the shortest path from the top-left corner (0,0) to the bottom-right corner (m-1,n-1) of the grid. However, you are given a certain number `k` which denotes the number of obstacles you are allowed to eliminate while on this path.

Return the length of the shortest path such that you can reach the destination within the allowed number of obstacle eliminations. If it is not possible to reach the destination, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Constraints:** 
   - What is the range of `m`, `n`, and `k`?
   - Should we consider the grid boundaries to ensure we don't move out of bounds?
   - Are we allowed to revisit a cell where we have already eliminated obstacles?

2. **Start and End Points:**
   - Do we always start at (0,0) and end at (m-1,n-1)?
   - Can the start/end cells contain obstacles?

3. **Movement:**
   - Are diagonal moves allowed?

### Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use a **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithm because it is well-suited for shortest path problems on unweighted grids and ensures that we explore nodes level by level.

**Steps:**
1. Initialize a queue to manage BFS traversal, starting from the top-left corner of the grid.
2. Maintain a 3D visited array to track the state `[x][y][remaining_eliminations]`.
3. Expand all four possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current cell, and account for obstacle eliminations if needed.
4. If we reach the bottom-right corner during BFS, return the current path length.
5. If the queue is exhausted and the bottom-right corner hasn't been reached, return -1.

### Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} grid
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {number}
 */
var shortestPath = function(grid, k) {
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;

    if (m === 1 && n === 1) return 0;
    
    // BFS queue
    const queue = [[0, 0, 0, k]]; // [x, y, distance, remaining obstacles]
    const directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]];
    
    // Visited array to track visited coordinates with remaining k eliminations
    const visited = Array.from({length: m}, () => Array.from({length: n}, () => Array(k + 1).fill(false)));
    visited[0][0][k] = true;
    
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const [x, y, distance, remainingK] = queue.shift();
        
        for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
            const nx = x + dx;
            const ny = y + dy;
            
            if (nx >= 0 && nx < m && ny >= 0 && ny < n) {
                let newK = remainingK;
                
                if (grid[nx][ny] === 1) {
                    newK--;
                }
                
                if (newK >= 0 && !visited[nx][ny][newK]) {
                    if (nx == m - 1 && ny == n - 1) {
                        return distance + 1;
                    }
                    
                    visited[nx][ny][newK] = true;
                    queue.push([nx, ny, distance + 1, newK]);
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return -1;
};
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of this BFS solution is `O(m * n * k)`, while the space complexity is also `O(m * n * k)` due to the 3D array we use for tracking the visited states.

This approach efficiently explores all potential paths while accounting for the maximum number of obstacles that can be eliminated.
