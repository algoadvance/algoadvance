[Leetcode 299. Bulls and Cows](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l299)
### Problem Statement

You are playing the Bulls and Cows game with your friend.

You write down a secret number and ask your friend to guess what the number is. When your friend makes a guess, you provide a hint with the following information:
- The number of "bulls", which are digits in the guess that are in the correct position.
- The number of "cows", which are digits in the guess that are in your secret number but are located in the wrong position. Note that both secret and guess may contain duplicate digits.

Given the secret number and your friend's guess, return the hint in the format "xAyB":
- x is the number of bulls.
- y is the number of cows.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length of the input strings?**
   - The input strings (secret and guess) are of the same length and the length can be up to 1000.

2. **Are the input strings guaranteed to contain only digits?**
   - Yes, both secret and guess are numeric strings, containing only digits from '0' to '9'.

3. **Do we need to consider any constraints related to inputs?**
   - It is guaranteed that the length of both strings is the same.

### Strategy

1. Initialize two counters, `bulls` and `cows`.
2. Use an array to keep track of unmatched numbers in both `secret` and `guess`.
3. Traverse both strings simultaneously:
   - If the characters match, increment the `bulls` counter.
   - If not, store unmatched characters in separate arrays for `secret` and `guess`.
4. Use a map to count occurrences of unmatched characters in `secret`.
5. For each unmatched character in `guess`, check if it is in the map and count how many cows can be formed.
6. Construct the result string in the format "xAyB".

### Code

```javascript
function getHint(secret, guess) {
    let bulls = 0;
    let cows = 0;
    
    const secretMap = new Array(10).fill(0);
    const guessMap = new Array(10).fill(0);
    
    // First pass to count bulls
    for (let i = 0; i < secret.length; i++) {
        if (secret[i] === guess[i]) {
            bulls++;
        } else {
            secretMap[secret[i]]++;
            guessMap[guess[i]]++;
        }
    }
    
    // Second pass to count cows
    for (let i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        cows += Math.min(secretMap[i], guessMap[i]);
    }

    return `${bulls}A${cows}B`;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the `secret` or `guess` strings. We pass through the strings twice: once to count bulls and prepare the maps, and once to count cows.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1), as we are using a fixed-size (length 10) array for counting digits, regardless of the input size.
