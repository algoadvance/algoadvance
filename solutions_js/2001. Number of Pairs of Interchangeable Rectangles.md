[Leetcode 2001. Number of Pairs of Interchangeable Rectangles](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2001)
## Problem Statement

**2001. Number of Pairs of Interchangeable Rectangles**

You are given `n` rectangles represented by a 2D integer array `rectangles` where `rectangles[i] = [widthi, heighti]`.

Two rectangles `i` and `j` (i < j) are considered **interchangeable** if either of the following conditions is true:
- `widthi` / `heighti` == `widthj` / `heightj`.

Return *the number of pairs of **interchangeable** rectangles*.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for `n`?**
   - The array `rectangles` can have up to 100,000 elements.
   
2. **Can the dimensions of rectangles be zero or negative?**
   - No, the dimensions are positive integers.

3. **What will be the typical value range for `widthi` and `heighti`?**
   - Both `widthi` and `heighti` are positive integers in the range [1, 10^9].

4. **Is the order of rectangles important?**
   - No, we are only counting pairs, so the order doesn't matter.

## Strategy

1. **Ratio Calculation**: The first step is to calculate the ratio of `width` to `height` for each rectangle. We can use `width` divided by `height` as a key for a hashmap.
   
2. **HashMap Usage**: Utilize a hashmap to store the count of each unique ratio. The key will be the ratio, and the value will be the frequency of rectangles having that ratio.

3. **Counting Pairs**: For each unique ratio with a count of `k`, the number of ways to choose 2 rectangles out of `k` rectangles (k choose 2) is given by the formula `k * (k - 1) / 2`. Sum these values up for all unique ratios to get the final answer.

4. **Edge Cases**: Handle cases where there are no pairs possible or where there are multiple rectangles with the same ratio.

## Code

Here's the implementation of the proposed solution:

```javascript
function interchangeableRectangles(rectangles) {
    const ratioMap = new Map();
    
    for (const [width, height] of rectangles) {
        const ratio = width / height;
        if (ratioMap.has(ratio)) {
            ratioMap.set(ratio, ratioMap.get(ratio) + 1);
        } else {
            ratioMap.set(ratio, 1);
        }
    }

    let interchangeableCount = 0;

    for (const count of ratioMap.values()) {
        if (count > 1) {
            // nC2 = n * (n - 1) / 2
            interchangeableCount += count * (count - 1) / 2;
        }
    }

    return interchangeableCount;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(interchangeableRectangles([[4, 8], [3, 6], [10, 20], [15, 30]])) // Output: 6
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of the solution is `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of rectangles. Here's the breakdown:
- Calculating the ratio for each of the `n` rectangles takes `O(n)`.
- Inserting into the hashmap takes `O(1)` per operation and `O(n)` overall.
- Computing the final count from the hashmap takes `O(n)` in the worst case.

Thus, the total time complexity is `O(n)`.
