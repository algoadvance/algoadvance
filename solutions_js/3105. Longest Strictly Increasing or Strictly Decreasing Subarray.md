[Leetcode 3105. Longest Strictly Increasing or Strictly Decreasing Subarray](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3105)
### Problem Statement:
Given an integer array `nums`, find the length of the longest subarray that is either strictly increasing or strictly decreasing.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,3,5,4,2,8]
Output: 3
Explanation: The longest strictly increasing subarray is [1,3,5] with length 3.
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the length of the input array `nums`?
   **A:** Yes, typically the problem will specify constraints. For the sake of this problem, assume `1 ≤ nums.length ≤ 10^5`.

2. **Q:** Can the array contain duplicate values?
   **A:** Yes, but since we are looking for strictly increasing or decreasing subarrays, consecutive duplicate values will break the streak.

3. **Q:** Is the subarray contiguous?
   **A:** Yes, the subarray must be contiguous.

### Strategy:

To solve this problem, we can employ a linear scan approach to keep track of the lengths of the currently increasing or decreasing subarrays. We'll maintain two counters: one for the length of the current strictly increasing subarray and one for the strictly decreasing subarray. As we iterate through the array, we update these counters and keep track of the maximum length encountered.

1. Initialize variables to track lengths of the current increasing and decreasing subarrays (`inc_len` and `dec_len`) and a variable to track the maximum length (`max_len`).
   
2. Iterate through the array from the second element to the end.
   - If the current element is greater than the previous one, increment the increasing subarray length and reset the decreasing subarray length.
   - If the current element is less than the previous one, increment the decreasing subarray length and reset the increasing subarray length.
   - If the current element is equal to the previous one, reset both increasing and decreasing subarray lengths to 1.
   
3. Update the `max_len` during each iteration.

4. Return `max_len` at the end of the loop.

### Code:

```javascript
function longestIncreasingDecreasingSubarray(nums) {
    if (nums.length == 0) return 0;

    let inc_len = 1, dec_len = 1, max_len = 1;

    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] > nums[i - 1]) {
            inc_len++;
            dec_len = 1;
        } else if (nums[i] < nums[i - 1]) {
            dec_len++;
            inc_len = 1;
        } else {
            inc_len = 1;
            dec_len = 1;
        }
        max_len = Math.max(max_len, inc_len, dec_len);
    }
    return max_len;
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **O(n)**: We iterate through the array exactly once.
- **O(1)**: We use a constant amount of extra space regardless of the input size.

This linear time solution ensures we efficiently find the longest strictly increasing or strictly decreasing subarray.
