[Leetcode 3042. Count Prefix and Suffix Pairs I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3042)
### Problem Statement

Given two arrays of strings `A` and `B`, count the number of pairs `(a, b)` such that:
- `a` is a prefix of `b` or
- `a` is a suffix of `b`

Write a function with the following signature:
```javascript
function countPrefixSuffixPairs(A, B) {
    // Your code here
}
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What type of strings are in arrays `A` and `B`?**
   - The strings contain lowercase English letters only.

2. **Can strings in `A` or `B` be empty?**
   - No, all strings are non-empty.

3. **Can `A` or `B` be empty?**
   - If either `A` or `B` is empty, the expected output should be `0`.

4. **Are there any constraints on the length of the arrays or the strings within them?**
   - Typical constraints in a coding interview are:
     - `1 <= len(A), len(B) <= 1000`
     - `1 <= len(a), len(b) <= 100`

### Strategy

1. **Iterate Through Each String in Arrays:**
   - Loop through each string `a` in array `A`.
   - For each string `a`, loop through each string `b` in array `B`.

2. **Check Prefix and Suffix Conditions:**
   - Check if `a` is a prefix of `b` using `b.startsWith(a)`.
   - Check if `a` is a suffix of `b` using `b.endsWith(a)`.

3. **Count Valid Pairs:**
   - Increment the count whenever either condition is satisfied.

### Time Complexity

- **Nested Loop Analysis:**
  - Outer loop iterates through every element in `A` which is `O(n)`, where `n` is the length of `A`.
  - Inner loop iterates through every element in `B` which is `O(m)`, where `m` is the length of `B`.
  - Checking if a string is a prefix or suffix is `O(k)` where `k` is the length of the string `a`.

Given this, the overall time complexity is `O(n * m * k)`, which is efficient for the given constraints.

### Code

```javascript
function countPrefixSuffixPairs(A, B) {
    let count = 0;
    
    // Iterate over each string in A
    for (let a of A) {
        // Iterate over each string in B
        for (let b of B) {
            // Check if a is a prefix of b
            if (b.startsWith(a)) {
                count++;
                continue; // Move to next element in B since we already counted this pair
            }
            // Check if a is a suffix of b
            if (b.endsWith(a)) {
                count++;
            }
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}

// Example usage:
let A = ["ab", "a"];
let B = ["abc", "bca", "cab"];
console.log(countPrefixSuffixPairs(A, B));  // Output: 2
```

### Explanation

1. **Initialization:**
   - Initialize a counter `count` to zero to track the number of valid pairs.

2. **Nested Loops:**
   - Outer loop runs through each element `a` in array `A`.
   - Inner loop runs through each element `b` in array `B`.

3. **Condition Checks:**
   - Use `b.startsWith(a)` to check if `a` is a prefix of `b`. If true, increment the counter.
   - Use `b.endsWith(a)` to check if `a` is a suffix of `b` (only if the prefix check was false to avoid double counting).

4. **Return the Count:**
   - After all iterations, return the total count of valid prefix-suffix pairs.

This approach ensures we efficiently and correctly count the pairs according to the given criteria.
