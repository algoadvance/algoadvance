[Leetcode 2639. Find the Width of Columns of a Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2639)
### Problem Statement:
You are given a 0-indexed m x n integer matrix `grid`. The width of a column is the maximum length of its integers.

- For example, if `grid = [[-10], [3], [12]]`, the width of the only column is `3` since `-10` is the longest integer.
- Return an integer array `ans` of size `n` where `ans[i]` is the width of the `i-th` column.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **What are the constraints on the input values?** 
    - Typically, LeetCode problems specify constraints, such as `1 <= m, n <= 100` and `-10^6 <= grid[i][j] <= 10^6`.
  
2. **Can the grid contain only positive numbers or zeros?**
    - The grid can contain both positive and negative integers.
 
3. **What should the function return if the input grid is empty?**
    - The problem specifies a valid m x n matrix, implying non-empty grids.

### Strategy:
1. **Initialize an array** to store the width of each column.
2. **Iterate over each column** and find the length of the string representation of each element to handle negative numbers correctly.
3. **Keep track of the maximum length** of these string representations for each column.
4. **Store these maximum lengths** in the resultant array and return it.

### Code:
Here's the JavaScript function to solve the problem:

```javascript
var findColumnWidth = function(grid) {
    if (!grid || grid.length === 0 || grid[0].length === 0) {
        return [];
    }
    
    let rows = grid.length;
    let cols = grid[0].length;
    let colWidths = new Array(cols).fill(0);
    
    for (let col = 0; col < cols; col++) {
        let maxLength = 0;
        for (let row = 0; row < rows; row++) {
            let cellLength = grid[row][col].toString().length;
            if (cellLength > maxLength) {
                maxLength = cellLength;
            }
        }
        colWidths[col] = maxLength;
    }
    
    return colWidths;
};
```

### Time Complexity:
- The time complexity is **O(m * n)** where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns.
  - This is because we iterate through each element in the grid once to calculate the length of its string representation.
- The space complexity is **O(n)** for the resulting array storing widths of `n` columns.

This approach ensures we efficiently determine the maximum width for each column by leveraging string length for accurate width measurement in the case of negative and large numbers.
