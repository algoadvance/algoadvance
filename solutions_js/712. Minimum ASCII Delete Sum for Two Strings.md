[Leetcode 712. Minimum ASCII Delete Sum for Two Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l712)
### Problem Statement

Given two strings `s1` and `s2`, the task is to find the minimum ASCII delete sum of two strings to make them equal. In other words, we want to delete characters from both strings such that the resulting strings are equal, and we need to minimize the total ASCII sum of the deleted characters.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Range**:
   - Can the strings `s1` and `s2` be empty?
     - Yes, they can be empty.
   - What is the maximum length of the strings?
     - The length of each string can be up to 1000.

2. **Output**:
   - Should the result be an integer representing the minimum ASCII delete sum?
     - Yes, the result should be an integer.

3. **Characters**:
   - Are the strings strictly lowercase letters, or can they contain other characters?
     - The strings can contain any ASCII characters.

Given these clarifications, let's outline the strategy and provide the code solution.

### Strategy

The problem can be approached using dynamic programming (DP). We define `dp[i][j]` as the minimum ASCII delete sum to make the substrings `s1[0:i]` and `s2[0:j]` equal.

#### Steps:
1. **Base Case Initialization**:
   - `dp[0][0]` is `0` since no characters need to be deleted when both substrings are empty.
   - `dp[i][0]` is the sum of ASCII values of `s1[0:i]` since we need to delete all characters from `s1` to make it empty.
   - `dp[0][j]` is the sum of ASCII values of `s2[0:j]` since we need to delete all characters from `s2` to make it empty.

2. **DP Transition**:
   - If characters `s1[i-1]` and `s2[j-1]` are the same, then no delete is required for these characters:
     - `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1]`
   - If they are different, we consider two cases:
     - Delete `s1[i-1]`: `dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + ASCII value of s1[i-1]`
     - Delete `s2[j-1]`: `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1] + ASCII value of s2[j-1]`
   - The minimum of these two options will be chosen for `dp[i][j]`.

3. **Final Result**:
   - The value `dp[len1][len2]` will give the answer for the entire strings `s1` and `s2`.

### Code

```javascript
function minimumDeleteSum(s1, s2) {
    const len1 = s1.length;
    const len2 = s2.length;
    
    let dp = Array.from({ length: len1 + 1 }, () => Array(len2 + 1).fill(0));

    // Initialize base cases
    for (let i = 1; i <= len1; i++) {
        dp[i][0] = dp[i - 1][0] + s1.charCodeAt(i - 1);
    }

    for (let j = 1; j <= len2; j++) {
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j - 1] + s2.charCodeAt(j - 1);
    }

    // Fill the dp table
    for (let i = 1; i <= len1; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= len2; j++) {
            if (s1[i - 1] === s2[j - 1]) {
                dp[i][j] = dp[i - 1][j - 1];
            } else {
                dp[i][j] = Math.min(
                    dp[i - 1][j] + s1.charCodeAt(i - 1),
                    dp[i][j - 1] + s2.charCodeAt(j - 1)
                );
            }
        }
    }

    return dp[len1][len2];
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is `O(len1 * len2)` where `len1` is the length of `s1` and `len2` is the length of `s2`. This is due to the double loop needed to fill the DP table.

The space complexity is also `O(len1 * len2)` because of the space needed to store the DP table.
