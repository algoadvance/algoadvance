[Leetcode 2897. Apply Operations on Array to Maximize Sum of Squares](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2897)
## Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `nums` and an integer `k`. In one operation, you can choose any element of the array and increment it by 1.

Return the maximum possible sum of squares of the elements in the array after applying exactly `k` operations.

The sum of squares of the elements of an array is the sum of the squares of its elements.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Can `nums` contain negative integers?
2. Is there a constraint on the size of `nums` or the value of `k`?
3. Should we consider overflow issues for large integers?

For simplicity, let's assume:
- `nums` contains non-negative integers.
- The length of `nums` is `n` and `1 <= n <= 10^4`.
- The value of each element in `nums` is between `1` and `10^6`.
- `1 <= k <= 10^6`.

## Strategy

To maximize the sum of squares, we should increment the smallest numbers first. This is because the increment in the squares will be larger if added to smaller numbers initially. Here's the step-by-step approach:

1. Use a min-heap (priority queue) to always access the smallest element quickly.
2. For each of the `k` operations, extract the minimum element from the heap, increment it by 1, and push it back into the heap.
3. Once all operations are done, calculate the sum of squares of the modified array.

### Steps:

1. Convert `nums` into a min-heap.
2. Perform `k` operations: 
    - Extract the minimum element.
    - Increment it by 1.
    - Push it back to the heap.
3. Sum the squares of all elements in the heap and return the result.

## Code

```javascript
var maximumSumOfSquares = function(nums, k) {
    // Convert nums into a min-heap
    const minHeap = new MinPriorityQueue();

    nums.forEach(num => minHeap.enqueue(num));

    // Apply k operations
    for (let i = 0; i < k; i++) {
        let minVal = minHeap.dequeue().element;
        minVal++;
        minHeap.enqueue(minVal);
    }

    // Calculate the sum of squares
    let sumOfSquares = 0;
    while (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
        let num = minHeap.dequeue().element;
        sumOfSquares += num * num;
    }

    return sumOfSquares;
};

// Helper class (Priority Queue implementation)
class MinPriorityQueue {
    constructor() {
        this.heap = [];
    }
    
    enqueue(val) {
        this.heap.push(val);
        this._bubbleUp();
    }
    
    dequeue() {
        if (this.size() === 1) {
            return { element: this.heap.pop() };
        } else {
            const min = this.heap[0];
            this.heap[0] = this.heap.pop();
            this._sinkDown(0);
            return { element: min };
        }
    }
    
    _bubbleUp() {
        let index = this.heap.length - 1;
        while (index > 0) {
            const parentIndex = Math.floor((index - 1) / 2);
            if (this.heap[index] >= this.heap[parentIndex]) break;
            [this.heap[index], this.heap[parentIndex]] = [this.heap[parentIndex], this.heap[index]];
            index = parentIndex;
        }
    }
    
    _sinkDown(index) {
        const length = this.heap.length;
        const element = this.heap[index];
        while (true) {
            const leftChildIndex = 2 * index + 1;
            const rightChildIndex = 2 * index + 2;
            let leftChild, rightChild;
            let swap = null;

            if (leftChildIndex < length) {
                leftChild = this.heap[leftChildIndex];
                if (leftChild < element) {
                    swap = leftChildIndex;
                }
            }

            if (rightChildIndex < length) {
                rightChild = this.heap[rightChildIndex];
                if (
                    (swap === null && rightChild < element) ||
                    (swap !== null && rightChild < leftChild)
                ) {
                    swap = rightChildIndex;
                }
            }

            if (swap === null) break;

            this.heap[index] = this.heap[swap];
            this.heap[swap] = element;
            index = swap;
        }
    }

    size() {
        return this.heap.length;
    }

    isEmpty() {
        return this.heap.length === 0;
    }
}
```

## Time Complexity

- Building the initial heap: `O(n)`
- Each operation (extract min and insert incremented value): `O(log n)`
- Total operations: `k * O(log n)`
- Calculating the final sum of squares: `O(n)`

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n + k log n)`.
