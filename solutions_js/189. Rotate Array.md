## Problem Statement

Leetcode Problem 189: Rotate Array

Given an array, rotate the array to the right by k steps, where k is non-negative.

### Example 1:
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7], k = 3
Output: [5,6,7,1,2,3,4]

### Example 2:
Input: nums = [-1,-100,3,99], k = 2
Output: [3,99,-1,-100]

### Constraints:
- 1 <= nums.length <= 10^5
- -2^31 <= nums[i] <= 2^31 - 1
- 0 <= k <= 10^5

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Are there any constraints on the memory usage?
   **A:** Since this is a general problem statement, there are no explicit memory constraints. Efficient memory usage is preferred but using additional space is acceptable.

2. **Q:** What should be the output if the value of k is greater than the length of the array?
   **A:** The effect of rotating the array by k steps where k is greater than the length of the array is equivalent to rotating by `k % nums.length` steps.

## Strategy

There are multiple ways to rotate the array, but one of the most efficient ways, in terms of both time complexity and space complexity, is by reversing the array.

### Steps:
1. Reverse the entire array.
2. Reverse the first `k` elements.
3. Reverse the remaining `n-k` elements.

### Example Walkthrough

Given array: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]`, k = 3.

1. Reverse entire array: `[7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
2. Reverse first k elements (first 3 elements): `[5, 6, 7, 4, 3, 2, 1]`
3. Reverse the remaining n-k elements: `[5, 6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4]`

## Code

```javascript
function rotate(nums, k) {
    // If k is greater than nums.length, reduce k by modulo operation
    k = k % nums.length;

    // Helper function to reverse a portion of the array
    const reverse = (start, end) => {
        while (start < end) {
            [nums[start], nums[end]] = [nums[end], nums[start]];
            start++;
            end--;
        }
    };

    // Reverse the entire array
    reverse(0, nums.length - 1);
    // Reverse the first k elements
    reverse(0, k - 1);
    // Reverse the remaining elements
    reverse(k, nums.length - 1);
}
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this approach is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the number of elements in the array. This is because each reversal operation (including the three reversals) takes linear time relative to the segment it is reversing.

The space complexity is \(O(1)\) since we are performing the operations in place and not using any extra space proportional to the input size.

With this approach, we efficiently rotate the array with minimal operations and memory footprint.
