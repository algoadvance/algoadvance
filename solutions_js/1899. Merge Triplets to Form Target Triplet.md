[Leetcode 1899. Merge Triplets to Form Target Triplet](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1899)
### Problem Statement

You are given a 2D integer array `triplets`, where `triplets[i] = [ai, bi, ci]` describes the `i-th` triplet. You are also given an integer array `target = [x, y, z]` that describes the triplet you want to form. 

To form the `target` triplet, you can select some of the given triplets and then update each element of the `target` triplet as follows:

- target[0] = max(target[0], ai)
- target[1] = max(target[1], bi)
- target[2] = max(target[2], ci)

Return `true` if it is possible to form the `target` triplet `[x, y, z]` as described above, or `false` otherwise.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can we assume all integers in the arrays are positive?**
   - Yes, you can assume that all integers are positive.
  
2. **Is there a limit on the size of `triplets` or the values they can contain?**
   - For the scope of this problem, there isn't a specific mention of limits, but you can assume the input size is manageable within typical constraints for interview problems.

3. **Do we have to use all triplets or just a subset of them?**
   - You can use a subset of the given triplets.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, you need to follow these steps:

1. **Filtering**: First, filter out the triplets that can never help in forming the target triplet. Specifically, if a triplet's any value exceeds the corresponding value in the target triplet, discard it because it is not useful.

2. **Tracking**: Then, track the set of triplets that can be used to reach each individual target component (`target[0]`, `target[1]`, `target[2]`).

3. **Validation**: Once you have included all useful triplets, check if you can form the target triplet by ensuring all target values can be reached using the maximum values from the triplets.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} triplets
 * @param {number[]} target
 * @return {boolean}
 */
function mergeTriplets(triplets, target) {
    const [target_a, target_b, target_c] = target;

    let canReachA = false, canReachB = false, canReachC = false;
    
    for (let [a, b, c] of triplets) {
        // Only consider triplets which are not exceeding target in any dimension
        if (a <= target_a && b <= target_b && c <= target_c) {
            if (a === target_a) canReachA = true;
            if (b === target_b) canReachB = true;
            if (c === target_c) canReachC = true;
        }
    }
    
    // We need to be able to reach all values in the target
    return canReachA && canReachB && canReachC;    
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n) where `n` is the number of triplets. This is because we do a single pass through the list of triplets to determine if each triplet can contribute to the target triplet.
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1). We are using only a constant amount of extra space for the boolean variables (`canReachA`, `canReachB`, `canReachC`).

This approach ensures that the solution is efficient and straightforward, using linear time to iterate through the list of triplets and determine if the target triplet can be formed.
