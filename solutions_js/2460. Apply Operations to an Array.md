## Problem Statement
LeetCode 2460: Apply Operations to an Array

You are given a 0-indexed array `nums` of size `n` consisting of non-negative integers.

You need to apply the following operations until every element in `nums` is either 0 or cannot be operated upon:

1. **If `nums[i] == nums[i + 1] && nums[i] != 0`:** 
   - Set `nums[i] = 2 * nums[i]`.
   - Set `nums[i + 1] = 0`.
   - Move to the next pair of elements by incrementing `i` by 2.

2. **If the condition in step 1 is not met**: 
   - Move to the next element by incrementing `i` by 1.

After completing the above operations, shift all the 0s to the right while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

Return the modified array.

### Example
**Input:**

```
nums = [1,2,2,1,1,0,0]
```

**Output:**

```
[1,4,2,0,0,0,0]
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Will the input always be a valid array of non-negative integers?**
   - Yes, the problem guarantees non-negative integer inputs.
2. **Can the array be empty?**
   - The problem constraints do not provide information on this, but let's assume it's non-empty.
3. **Are there additional constraints on the size of the array `n`?**
   - The problem does not specify, so we assume it's large enough to consider optimal performance.

## Strategy
1. Traverse the array and apply the operations as described:
   - Use a while loop to iterate.
   - Check if the current element is equal to the next one and both are non-zero. If so, update the elements and skip to the next pair.
   - Otherwise, just move to the next element.
2. After applying the operations, shift all zeros to the right while maintaining the order of non-zero elements:
   - Use a two-pointer technique or an additional array to collect non-zero elements first and then append zeros at the end.

## Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[]} nums
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var applyOperations = function(nums) {
    let n = nums.length;
    let i = 0;

    // Step 1: Apply the given operations
    while (i < n - 1) {
        if (nums[i] !== 0 && nums[i] === nums[i + 1]) {
            nums[i] = nums[i] * 2;
            nums[i + 1] = 0;
            i += 2;
        } else {
            i += 1;
        }
    }

    // Step 2: Shift all zeros to the right
    let result = [];
    let zerosCount = 0;

    for (let num of nums) {
        if (num === 0) {
            zerosCount++;
        } else {
            result.push(num);
        }
    }

    // Append the zeros
    while (zerosCount > 0) {
        result.push(0);
        zerosCount--;
    }

    return result;
};

// Example usage:
let nums = [1, 2, 2, 1, 1, 0, 0];
console.log(applyOperations(nums)); // Output: [1, 4, 2, 0, 0, 0, 0]
```

## Time Complexity
- Step 1 (applying operations): O(n)
- Step 2 (shifting zeros): O(n)

Thus, the total time complexity is **O(n)**, where n is the length of the input array `nums`.
