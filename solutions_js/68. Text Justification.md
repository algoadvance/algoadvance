[Leetcode 68. Text Justification](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l68)
## Problem Statement

Given an array of words and a width `maxWidth`, format the text such that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters and is fully (left and right) justified. Words should be packed as many as possible in each line. Pad extra spaces `' '` when necessary so that each line has exactly `maxWidth` characters.

Extra spaces between words should be distributed as evenly as possible. If the number of spaces on a line does not divide evenly between words, the empty slots on the left will be assigned more spaces than the slots on the right.

For the last line of text, it should be left justified, and no extra space is inserted between words.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: words = ["This", "is", "an", "example", "of", "text", "justification."], maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
   "This    is    an",
   "example  of text",
   "justification.  "
]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: words = ["What","must","be","acknowledgment","shall","be"], maxWidth = 16
Output:
[
   "What   must   be",
   "acknowledgment  ",
   "shall be        "
]
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can words contain special characters or numbers?**
   - The problem does not explicitly mention this, so let's assume words can only contain alphabetic characters.
   
2. **Is there any restriction on the length of words themselves relative to `maxWidth`?**
   - Yes, each word's length will be less than or equal to `maxWidth`.

3. **How do we treat punctuation in the words?**
   - Words are strings of characters, and solely spaces should be managed, so punctuation should have no special treatment.

## Strategy

1. **Group Words into Lines:**
   - Traverse through the words array and group them into lines where the sum of the lengths of the words and the spaces between them is less than or equal to `maxWidth`.
   
2. **Justify Each Line:**
   - For lines that are not the last line:
     - Distribute extra spaces equally between the words.
     - If spaces to distribute are not evenly divisible, distribute the extra spaces from the left.
   - For the last line:
     - Join the words and pad the remaining space at the end.

3. **Handle Edge Cases:**
   - Single word line.
   - Lines where all space goes to the end.

## Code

```javascript
function fullJustify(words, maxWidth) {
    const result = [];
    let currentLine = [];
    let currentLineLength = 0;

    for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
        let word = words[i];
        if (currentLineLength + word.length + currentLine.length > maxWidth) {
            result.push(justify(currentLine, currentLineLength, maxWidth));
            currentLine = [];
            currentLineLength = 0;
        }
        currentLine.push(word);
        currentLineLength += word.length;
    }

    // process the last line
    result.push(leftJustify(currentLine, currentLineLength, maxWidth));

    return result;
}

function justify(line, lineLength, maxWidth) {
    let spacesToDistribute = maxWidth - lineLength;
    let spacesBetweenWords = line.length - 1;

    if (spacesBetweenWords === 0) {
        return line[0] + ' '.repeat(spacesToDistribute);
    }
    
    let minSpaces = Math.floor(spacesToDistribute / spacesBetweenWords);
    let extraSpaces = spacesToDistribute % spacesBetweenWords;

    for (let i = 0; i < extraSpaces; i++) {
        line[i] += ' ';
    }

    return line.join(' '.repeat(minSpaces + 1));
}

function leftJustify(line, lineLength, maxWidth) {
    let result = line.join(' ');
    let spacesToAdd = maxWidth - result.length;
    return result + ' '.repeat(spacesToAdd);
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Grouping Complexity:** We traverse all words once, which takes `O(n)`.
- **Justification Complexity:** For each line, distributing spaces and creating the justified string also takes linear time with respect to the number of words, thus resulting in `O(number of lines * average line length)`.

In total, the time complexity is approximately `O(n)`, where `n` is the number of words in the input.

This solution efficiently handles the problem within the constraints provided by the problem statement.
