[Leetcode 622. Design Circular Queue](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l622)
### Problem Statement
Design your implementation of a circular queue. A circular queue is a linear data structure in which the operations are performed based on FIFO (First In First Out) principle and the last position is connected back to the first position to make a circle. It is also called "Ring Buffer".

One of the benefits of the circular queue is that we can make use of the spaces in front of the queue. 

- Implement the `MyCircularQueue` class:
  - `MyCircularQueue(k)` Initializes the object with the size of the queue to be `k`.
  - `bool enQueue(int value)` Inserts an element into the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.
  - `bool deQueue()` Deletes an element from the circular queue. Return true if the operation is successful.
  - `int Front()` Gets the front item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
  - `int Rear()` Gets the last item from the queue. If the queue is empty, return -1.
  - `bool isEmpty()` Checks whether the circular queue is empty or not.
  - `bool isFull()` Checks whether the circular queue is full or not.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What should the behavior be if we try to `enQueue` into a full queue or `deQueue` from an empty queue?
   - If we `enQueue` into a full queue, the operation should fail and return `false`.
   - If we `deQueue` from an empty queue, the operation should fail and return `false`.


### Strategy
1. **Initialization (`MyCircularQueue(k)`):**
   - Maintain an array to store elements.
   - Use two pointers `head` and `tail` to mark the start and end of the queue.
   - Keep a count of the current number of elements to easily track if the queue is full or empty.

2. **Inserting Elements (`enQueue(value)`):**
   - Check if the queue is full.
   - If not, place the new value at the `tail` position, update the `tail` pointer to the next position in a circular manner, increment the count.
   - Return `true` if successful.

3. **Deleting Elements (`deQueue()`):**
   - Check if the queue is empty.
   - If not, move the `head` pointer to the next position in a circular manner, decrement the count.
   - Return `true` if successful.

4. **Fetching Front and Rear (`Front()`, `Rear()`):**
   - Check if the queue is empty.
   - Return the value at the `head` for `Front()` and value at `(tail - 1 + length) % length` for `Rear()`.

5. **Checking if Empty or Full (`isEmpty()`, `isFull()`):**
   - Compare the count of elements to 0 for `isEmpty()`.
   - Compare the count of elements to the capacity for `isFull()`.

### Code
```javascript
class MyCircularQueue {
    constructor(k) {
        this.queue = new Array(k).fill(null);
        this.head = -1;
        this.tail = -1;
        this.size = k;
        this.count = 0;
    }

    enQueue(value) {
        if (this.isFull()) {
            return false;
        }
        if (this.isEmpty()) {
            this.head = 0;
        }
        this.tail = (this.tail + 1) % this.size;
        this.queue[this.tail] = value;
        this.count++;
        return true;
    }

    deQueue() {
        if (this.isEmpty()) {
            return false;
        }
        if (this.head === this.tail) {
            this.head = -1;
            this.tail = -1;
        } else {
            this.head = (this.head + 1) % this.size;
        }
        this.count--;
        return true;
    }

    Front() {
        if (this.isEmpty()) {
            return -1;
        }
        return this.queue[this.head];
    }

    Rear() {
        if (this.isEmpty()) {
            return -1;
        }
        return this.queue[this.tail];
    }

    isEmpty() {
        return this.count === 0;
    }

    isFull() {
        return this.count === this.size;
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity
- `enQueue(value)`: O(1), constant time insertion.
- `deQueue()`: O(1), constant time removal.
- `Front()`: O(1), constant time access.
- `Rear()`: O(1), constant time access.
- `isEmpty()`: O(1), constant time check.
- `isFull()`: O(1), constant time check.
