[Leetcode 2048. Next Greater Numerically Balanced Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2048)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, a numerically balanced number is a number where the count of each digit in the number matches that digit itself. For example, the number `1210` is numerically balanced because it contains one `0`, two `1`s, one `2`, and zero `3`s.

Write a function to find the smallest numerically balanced number that is strictly greater than `n`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the range of the input number `n`? (E.g., 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^6)
   - Can the input number `n` include leading zeros?

2. **Output Requirements**:
   - Should the function return the smallest numerically balanced number as a string or an integer?
   - Are there any performance constraints, such as a time limit for the solution?

For simplicity, let's assume:
- The input number `n` will be in the range of 1 to 10^6, and it won't have leading zeros.
- The function should return the smallest numerically balanced number as an integer.
- Efficient performance is required, but no strict time limit has been given.

### Strategy

1. **Incremental Search**:
   - Start from `n + 1` and keep incrementing by 1.
   - For each number, check if it is numerically balanced.
   
2. **Check Numerically Balanced**:
   - Convert the number to a string.
   - Count the frequency of each digit using an array or a map.
   - Verify if each digit's frequency matches the digit itself.

This brute-force method is simple but ensures correctness. We should be prepared to optimize if needed, but given the constraints, this approach can be a good start.

### Code

Here's the implementation:

```javascript
function nextGreaterNumericallyBalancedNumber(n) {
    function isNumericallyBalanced(num) {
        let str = num.toString();
        let count = Array(10).fill(0);
        
        for (let char of str) {
            count[parseInt(char)]++;
        }
        
        for (let i = 0; i <= 9; i++) {
            if (count[i] !== 0 && count[i] !== i) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        
        return true;
    }
    
    let candidate = n + 1;
    
    while (true) {
        if (isNumericallyBalanced(candidate)) {
            return candidate;
        }
        candidate++;
    }
}

// Example usage:
console.log(nextGreaterNumericallyBalancedNumber(1)); // Example small input
console.log(nextGreaterNumericallyBalancedNumber(10)); // Example small input
```

### Time Complexity

- **Checking if a number is numerically balanced**: O(d) where d is the number of digits in the number (max. 7 for n up to 10^6).
- **Overall complexity**: 
  - The worst-case scenario will depend on the gaps between numerically balanced numbers. If these gaps are small, the solution will be efficient.
  - In the worst case, if gaps are large (e.g., if we must check many numbers between `n` and the next balanced number), the complexity may approach O(n * d).
 
 This brute-force method is simple and can be optimized if necessary by a more efficient mechanism for generating the next candidate balanced number.
