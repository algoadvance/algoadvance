[Leetcode 2896. Apply Operations to Make Two Strings Equal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2896)
### Problem Statement

You are given two string arrays `words1` and `words2`. If the two string arrays are equivalent, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

Two string arrays are equivalent if by concatenating all the elements in `words1` in order and `words2` in order, the two strings are the same.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can I assume the arrays are non-empty?**
   - Yes, you can assume both arrays have at least one string.
   
2. **Will the strings contain only lowercase English letters?**
   - Yes, for this problem, you can assume the strings contain only lowercase English letters.
   
3. **Is there an upper limit for the size of the arrays?**
   - No specific limit is provided, but the arrays should be manageable within typical memory constraints for competitive programming problems.

### Strategy

1. **Concatenate the Elements:** 
   - Combine all the elements of both `words1` and `words2` to form two single strings.
   
2. **Compare the Strings:**
   - Compare the concatenated strings. If they are equal, return `true`; otherwise, return `false`.

### Time Complexity

- **Concatenation:**
  - Concatenating all elements in `words1` and `words2` takes \(O(n + m)\), where \(n\) and \(m\) are the number of characters in `words1` and `words2` respectively.
  
- **Comparison:**
  - Comparing two strings is also \(O(n + m)\) in the worst case.

Combining these, the overall time complexity is \(O(n + m)\).

### Code

```javascript
function arrayStringsAreEqual(words1, words2) {
    // Concatenating arrays into single strings
    const str1 = words1.join('');
    const str2 = words2.join('');
    
    // Comparing the resultant strings
    return str1 === str2;
}
```

### Explanation

1. **Join the Arrays:**
   - `words1.join('')` concatenates all strings in `words1` into a single string `str1`.
   - `words2.join('')` concatenates all strings in `words2` into a single string `str2`.
   
2. **String Comparison:**
   - The `===` operator checks if `str1` is exactly equal to `str2`.
   
3. **Return the Result:**
   - Return the result of the comparison.

This solution is efficient in terms of both time and space for the problem constraints.
