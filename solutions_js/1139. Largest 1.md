[Leetcode 1139. Largest 1](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1139)
### Problem Statement

Given a 2D grid of `0`s and `1`s, find the largest square containing only `1`s which is bordered by `0`s. Your function should return the area of that square. If no such square exists, return 0.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the square be placed at the edge of the grid?**
   - Yes, as long as it fits within the boundaries of the grid.

2. **Can there be multiple largest squares?**
   - Yes, but we only need to find the area of one of them.

3. **What are the size constraints for the grid?**
   - Typical constraints are grid sizes ranging from 1x1 to 300x300.

### Strategy

1. **Input Grid Parsing**: Start by creating an auxiliary grid to keep track of the number of continuous `1`s from the left and above for each grid cell.
2. **Auxiliary Grid**: Maintain two matrices, `left[i][j]` for the number of consecutive 1s from the left and `top[i][j]` for the number of consecutive 1s from the top.
3. **Evaluate Potential Squares**: For each cell, treat it as the bottom-right corner of a square and check all possible sizes of squares that can be formed.
4. **Validation**: For each potential square, ensure that all its borders are completely `1`s.

### Code

```javascript
function largest1BorderedSquare(grid) {
    const rows = grid.length;
    const cols = grid[0].length;

    // Auxiliary arrays
    const left = Array.from({ length: rows }, () => Array(cols).fill(0));
    const top = Array.from({ length: rows }, () => Array(cols).fill(0));

    let maxSide = 0;

    // Fill auxiliary arrays
    for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === 1) {
                left[i][j] = (j === 0 ? 0 : left[i][j - 1]) + 1;
                top[i][j] = (i === 0 ? 0 : top[i - 1][j]) + 1;
            }
        }
    }

    // Evaluate squares
    for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === 1) {
                let side = Math.min(left[i][j], top[i][j]);
                while (side > 0) {
                    if (top[i][j - side + 1] >= side && left[i - side + 1][j] >= side) {
                        maxSide = Math.max(maxSide, side);
                        break;
                    }
                    side--;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return maxSide * maxSide;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Preprocessing Time Complexity**: Filling the auxiliary arrays takes `O(n * m)` where `n` is the number of rows and `m` is the number of columns.
- **Square Evaluation Time Complexity**: Checking all possible squares also takes `O(n * m)`.

So, the overall time complexity is `O(n * m)`.

### Space Complexity

- **Auxiliary Space**: We used two additional `n x m` matrices for storing left and top counts, resulting in `O(n * m)` space complexity.

Thus, both time and space complexities are highly efficient for generating the solution even with the largest possible grid sizes.
