[Leetcode 2415. Reverse Odd Levels of Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2415)
## Problem Statement

This problem involves a binary tree where the objective is to reverse the values at the odd levels of the tree. The root node is considered to be at level 0 (even level). Note that the levels are 0-indexed. The tree is given to you, and you need to return the tree with the odd levels reversed.

Here is an example:
- Input: A binary tree.
- Output: The binary tree with all odd levels reversed.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What data structure represents the binary tree nodes?**
   - Each node of the tree follows the standard binary tree node structure, with `val`, `left`, and `right` properties.
   
2. **How should the tree be returned?**
   - The function should return the root node of the modified tree.

3. **What is the constraint on the number of nodes in the tree?**
   - The constraints typically will be given in the problem description, but assuming it can handle typical binary tree sizes in competitive programming.

## Strategy

1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS):**
   - Use a queue to perform BFS and process nodes level by level.
   - Keep track of the current level to determine if it's odd or even.

2. **Reversing Mechanism:**
   - If the current level is odd, store the node values in an array, reverse this array, and reassign these reversed values to the nodes at that level.

## Code

Below is a JavaScript function to solve the problem:

```javascript
// Definition for a binary tree node.
function TreeNode(val, left = null, right = null) {
    this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
    this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left);
    this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right);
}

var reverseOddLevels = function(root) {
    if (!root) return null;
    
    let queue = [root];
    let level = 0;
    
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        let size = queue.length;
        let currentLevelNodes = [];
        
        for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            let node = queue.shift();
            if (level % 2 === 1) {
                currentLevelNodes.push(node);
            }
            
            if (node.left) queue.push(node.left);
            if (node.right) queue.push(node.right);
        }
        
        if (level % 2 === 1) {
            let reversedValues = currentLevelNodes.map(n => n.val).reverse();
            for (let i = 0; i < currentLevelNodes.length; i++) {
                currentLevelNodes[i].val = reversedValues[i];
            }
        }
        
        level++;
    }
    
    return root;
};
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m), where m is the maximum number of nodes at any level in the tree (in the case of a complete binary tree, the last level has the most nodes).

This completes the solution for reversing the values at odd levels of a binary tree.
