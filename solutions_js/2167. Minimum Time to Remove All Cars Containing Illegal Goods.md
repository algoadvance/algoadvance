[Leetcode 2167. Minimum Time to Remove All Cars Containing Illegal Goods](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2167)
## Problem Statement

You are given a binary string `s` where `s[i] = '0'` denotes a car without illegal goods and `s[i] = '1'` denotes a car with illegal goods. The task is to determine the minimum time required to remove all cars containing illegal goods.

There are two operations you can perform on the string `s`:

1. Remove the leftmost or rightmost car. This operation takes 1 unit of time.
2. Remove any car in the middle of the string. This operation takes 2 units of time.

You need to remove all the cars with illegal goods (`'1'`) and return the minimum amount of time needed.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the string be empty?**
   - No, the string contains at least one car.
   
2. **Are we always guaranteed to have at least one car with illegal goods?**
   - Yes, it is implied that there's at least one '1' in the string since we need to remove all cars containing illegal goods.

3. **Are there constraints on the length of the string?**
   - While the problem statement does not specify constraints, solutions should be efficient.

## Strategy

To minimize the time, we can primarily use the operation that removes the leftmost or rightmost car since it costs less time (1 unit) compared to removing a middle car (2 units).

### Key Steps

1. **Detect the First and Last '1':**
   - Find the first and last occurrence of '1' in the string. Removing all cars outside this range costs 1 unit per car.

2. **Evaluate Removal Strategies:**
   - Consider the cost of removing all cars from the left up to the last '1'.
   - Consider the cost of removing all cars from the right up to the first '1'.
   - Consider the cost of removing cars by splitting and using middle removals judiciously.

### Example Analysis

Given the string `s` = `"001010001"`, the optimal removal paths could vary but the key is to start by removing cars outside of the range that encompasses all '1's.

## Code

Let's implement the solution using JavaScript:

```javascript
function minimumTime(s) {
    const n = s.length;
    let prefixCost = Array(n).fill(0);  // prefixCost[i] means the cost to remove all '1's from start to position i.
    let suffixCost = Array(n).fill(0);  // suffixCost[i] means the cost to remove all '1's from position i to end.

    // Calculate prefix costs
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (s[i] === '1') {
            prefixCost[i] = (i > 0 ? Math.min(prefixCost[i-1] + 2, i + 1) : 1);
        } else {
            prefixCost[i] = (i > 0 ? prefixCost[i-1] : 0);
        }
    }

    // Calculate suffix costs
    for (let i = n-1; i >= 0; i--) {
        if (s[i] === '1') {
            suffixCost[i] = (i < n-1 ? Math.min(suffixCost[i+1] + 2, n - i) : 1);
        } else {
            suffixCost[i] = (i < n-1 ? suffixCost[i+1] : 0);
        }
    }

    // Calculate minimum time using combined strategies
    let minTime = Math.min(prefixCost[n-1], suffixCost[0]);
    for (let i = 0; i < n-1; i++) {
        minTime = Math.min(minTime, prefixCost[i] + suffixCost[i+1]);
    }

    return minTime;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(minimumTime("001010001"));  // Output: 5
```

## Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is \(O(n)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s`. This is because we process the string twice to compute the prefix and suffix costs. Each computation is linear in time. The space complexity is also \(O(n)\) due to the storage of prefix and suffix cost arrays.
