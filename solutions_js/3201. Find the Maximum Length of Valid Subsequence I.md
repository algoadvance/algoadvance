[Leetcode 3201. Find the Maximum Length of Valid Subsequence I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3201)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` consisting of only lowercase English letters and an integer `k`. A subsequence of the string `s` is considered *valid* if it contains no letter more than `k` times. Find the maximum length of a valid subsequence of `s`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What's the length of the string `s`?**
   - Typically, this should be clarified but let's assume `s` can have up to `10^5` characters.

2. **Should we remove the characters directly from `s` to form the subsequence, or just identify the maximum length?**
   - We only need to identify the maximum length of such a subsequence.

3. **Is it guaranteed that `k` is greater than 0?**
   - Yes, we can assume `k` is at least 1.

### Strategy

1. **Count Frequencies**: Use a frequency counter to count the occurrence of each character in `s`.
2. **Calculate Maximum Valid Length**: Iterate through the frequency counter and add up the minimum between the count of each character and `k`. This ensures no character appears more than `k` times.

### Code

```javascript
function maxLengthOfValidSubsequence(s, k) {
    let freq = {};
    
    // Count frequencies of each character
    for (let char of s) {
        if (freq[char] == null) {
            freq[char] = 0;
        }
        freq[char]++;
    }

    let maxLength = 0;
    
    // Calculate the maximum length of a valid subsequence
    for (let char in freq) {
        maxLength += Math.min(freq[char], k);
    }
    
    return maxLength;
}
```

### Example

```javascript
console.log(maxLengthOfValidSubsequence("aabbcc", 2)); // Output: 6
console.log(maxLengthOfValidSubsequence("aabbcc", 1)); // Output: 3
console.log(maxLengthOfValidSubsequence("abc", 1));    // Output: 3
```

### Time Complexity

- **Counting Frequencies**: O(n), where n is the length of the string `s`.
- **Calculating Maximum Length**: O(1), has limited iterations over 26 possible letters.

Total time complexity is **O(n)**, making it efficient for large input sizes.
