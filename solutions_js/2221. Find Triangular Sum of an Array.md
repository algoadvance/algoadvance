[Leetcode 2221. Find Triangular Sum of an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2221)
### Problem Statement:

You are given a 0-indexed integer array `nums`, where `nums[i]` is a single digit. Repeat the following process until there is only one number in the array:

1. Create a new 0-indexed integer array of length `nums.length - 1`.
2. For each index `i` of the new array, set the value of the new array at index `i` to `(nums[i] + nums[i + 1]) % 10`, thereby reducing the length of `nums` by 1.

Return the triangular sum of the array.

**Example:**

1. Input: `nums = [1,2,3,4,5]`
2. Output: `8`
   
   Explanation:
   - We start with `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`.
   - The next array is `[3, 5, 7, 9]` (since `(1+2)%10=3`, `(2+3)%10=5`, `(3+4)%10=7`, and `(4+5)%10=9`).
   - Then `[8, 2, 6]` (from `(3+5)%10=8`, `(5+7)%10=2`, and `(7+9)%10=6`).
   - Then `[0, 8]` (from `(8+2)%10=0` and `(2+6)%10=8`).
   - Finally `[8]` (from `(0+8)%10=8`).

### Clarifying Questions:

1. Can the input array contain single digits only, specifically between 0 and 9?
2. Can the input array be empty, and if so, what should be the result?
   - **Assumption**: The input is a valid array of single digits, and array length is at least 1.

### Strategy:

To solve this problem, we can follow these steps:
1. Continue reducing the array by computing the sum of adjacent elements modulo 10 until only one element remains.
2. Each step will require iterating through the array to build a new array of length `n-1`.

### Code:

```javascript
function triangularSum(nums) {
    while (nums.length > 1) {
        let newArr = Array(nums.length - 1);
        for (let i = 0; i < nums.length - 1; i++) {
            newArr[i] = (nums[i] + nums[i + 1]) % 10;
        }
        nums = newArr; // Reassign nums to be the new array
    }
    return nums[0]; // The last remaining element is the triangular sum
}

// Example Usage:
const nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
console.log(triangularSum(nums)); // Output: 8
```

### Time Complexity:

The time complexity of this solution can be analyzed as:
- Each iteration reduces the length of the array by 1.
- The total number of iterations is `n-1` where `n` is the length of the array.
- In each iteration, we sum elements up to `n-(iteration number)`.

Therefore, the overall time complexity is `O(n^2)`, where `n` is the length of the input array. This is because the process involves multiple iterations and in each iteration we process the elements linearly.
