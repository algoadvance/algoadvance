[Leetcode 1684. Count the Number of Consistent Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1684)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `allowed` consisting of distinct characters and an array of strings `words`. A string is consistent if all characters in the string appear in the string `allowed`.

Return the number of consistent strings in the array `words`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: allowed = "ab", words = ["ad","bd","aaab","baa","badab"]
Output: 2

Explanation: Strings "aaab" and "baa" are consistent with the allowed characters.
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: allowed = "abc", words = ["a","b","c","ab","ac","bc","abc"]
Output: 7

Explanation: All strings are consistent.
```

**Example 3:**
```
Input: allowed = "cad", words = ["cc","acd","b","ba","bac","bad","ac","d"]
Output: 4

Explanation: Strings like "cc", "acd", "ac", and "d" are consistent with the allowed characters.
```

**Constraints:**
- `1 <= allowed.length <= 26`
- `1 <= words.length <= 10^4`
- `1 <= words[i].length <= 10`
- The characters in `allowed` are distinct.
- `allowed` and `words[i]` consist only of lowercase English letters.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Can `allowed` be empty?
   - No, based on the constraints `1 <= allowed.length <= 26`.
2. Are all characters in `allowed` guaranteed to be distinct?
   - Yes, it's specified in the problem statement.
3. Can `words` be empty?
   - No, based on the constraints `1 <= words.length <= 10^4`.

### Strategy
1. Convert the `allowed` string to a `Set` to allow O(1) time complexity checks for allowed characters.
2. Iterate through each word in the `words` array.
3. For each word, check if all characters are within the `allowed` set.
4. Count the number of words that satisfy the condition of being consistent.
5. Return the count.

### Time Complexity
- Creating the `allowed` set takes O(m), where `m` is the length of the `allowed` string.
- Checking each word against the allowed set takes O(n * k) where `n` is the number of words and `k` is the average length of each word in the `words` array.
- Thus, the overall time complexity is O(n * k).

### Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} allowed
 * @param {string[]} words
 * @return {number}
 */
function countConsistentStrings(allowed, words) {
    const allowedSet = new Set(allowed);
    let count = 0;
    
    for (const word of words) {
        let isConsistent = true;
        for (const char of word) {
            if (!allowedSet.has(char)) {
                isConsistent = false;
                break;
            }
        }
        if (isConsistent) {
            count += 1;
        }
    }
    
    return count;
}
```

### Explanation
1. Convert `allowed` string to a `Set` for quick lookup of allowed characters.
2. Initialize a counter `count` to 0.
3. Iterate through each word in `words`.
4. For each word, assume it's consistent (`isConsistent = true`).
5. Check each character in the word. If any character is not in the allowed set, mark the word as inconsistent (`isConsistent = false`) and break out of the loop.
6. If the word is consistent, increment the counter.
7. Return the final count of consistent strings.
