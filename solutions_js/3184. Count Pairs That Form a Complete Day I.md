[Leetcode 3184. Count Pairs That Form a Complete Day I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3184)
## Problem Statement:

You are given a list of numbers. A pair of numbers (i, j) is considered to form a complete day if the sum of numbers at those indices is divisible by `60`. The task is to count and return the number of such pairs.

Examples:
- Input: `nums = [30, 20, 150, 100, 40]`
  Output: `3`

Explanation:
- The pairs (i, j) such that `nums[i]+nums[j]` is divisible by 60 are:
    (30, 30), (20, 40), (150, 150), (100, 20)

## Clarifying Questions:

1. **Are the numbers in the list always non-negative?**
   Yes, assume all numbers are non-negative.
   
2. **Can the same element be paired with itself?**
   Yes, a number can be paired with itself if it results in a sum divisible by 60.
   
3. **What should the function return if the input list is empty or has less than two elements?**
   The function should return `0` in such cases.

## Strategy:

1. **Modulo Operation**: For each number in the list `nums`, compute `num % 60`. This gives us the remainder when each number is divided by 60.

2. **Counting Complements**: Use an array `remainderCounts` of size 60 to keep track of how many numbers have each possible remainder (0 to 59).

3. **Pair Calculation**: For each number, `num`, in `nums`:
   - Compute `modValue` as `num % 60`.
   - Calculate the complement `complementMod` as `(60 - modValue) % 60`.
   - The count of pairs that `(num)` can form is equal to the count of numbers we've seen so far that have the remainder equal to `complementMod`.

4. **Update Remainder Counts**: Update the `remainderCounts` for the current `modValue`.

## Code:

```javascript
function countPairs(nums) {
    let remainderCounts = Array(60).fill(0);
    let pairCount = 0;

    for (let num of nums) {
        let modValue = num % 60;
        let complementMod = (60 - modValue) % 60;
        
        pairCount += remainderCounts[complementMod];
        
        remainderCounts[modValue]++;
    }

    return pairCount;
}

// Example usage:
// const nums = [30, 20, 150, 100, 40];
// console.log(countPairs(nums)); // Output: 3
```

## Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity**: `O(n)` where `n` is the length of the input list `nums`. 
  - We iterate through the list once to compute remainders and valid pairs.
  - Using modulo operation and array lookups are constant time operations `O(1)`.

- **Space Complexity**: `O(1)` ignoring the input size since `remainderCounts` is an array of fixed size 60.
