[Leetcode 1926. Nearest Exit from Entrance in Maze](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1926)
## Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` matrix `maze` (0-indexed) with empty cells (represented as '.') and walls (represented as '+'). You are also given the `entrance` of the maze, where `entrance = [entrance_row, entrance_col]` denotes the row and column of the cell you are initially standing at.

In each step, you can move one cell up, down, left, or right. You cannot step into a cell with a wall, and you cannot step outside the maze. Your goal is to find the nearest exit from the entrance. An exit is defined as an empty cell that is at the border of the maze. The entrance does not count as an exit.

Return the number of steps in the shortest path from the entrance to the nearest exit, or `-1` if no such path exists.

### Example
```
Input: maze = [["+","+",".","+"],[".",".",".","+"],["+","+","+","."]], entrance = [1,2]
Output: 1
```

### Constraints
- `maze.length == m`
- `maze[i].length == n`
- `1 <= m, n <= 100`
- `maze[i][j]` is either `'.'` or `'+'`.
- `entrance.length == 2`
- `0 <= entrance_row < m`
- `0 <= entrance_col < n`
- `entrance` will always be an empty cell.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can we assume that the maze will have at least one exit?
2. Can we only move in four cardinal directions (up, down, left, right)?
3. Will the entrance always be a valid position within the maze?

## Strategy
1. **Breadth-First Search (BFS) Approach**: Since we need the shortest path in an unweighted grid, BFS is appropriate because it explores nodes level by level.
2. **Check Border Cells**: We need to check four possible border locations and if they contain an empty cell, we then process it.
3. **Direction Vectors**: Use direction vectors for moving up, down, left, and right.
4. **Visited Set**: Keep track of visited cells to prevent redundant processing.
5. **Edge Case Handling**: Check if the entrance itself is at the border and needs special handling.

### Code Implementation

```javascript
function nearestExit(maze, entrance) {
    const m = maze.length;
    const n = maze[0].length;
    const directions = [[1, 0], [-1, 0], [0, 1], [0, -1]]; // Down, Up, Right, Left
    const queue = [[...entrance, 0]]; // row, col, steps
    const visited = new Array(m).fill(0).map(() => new Array(n).fill(false));
    visited[entrance[0]][entrance[1]] = true;

    while (queue.length > 0) {
        const [currentRow, currentCol, steps] = queue.shift();
        
        for (const [dRow, dCol] of directions) {
            const newRow = currentRow + dRow;
            const newCol = currentCol + dCol;

            if (newRow >= 0 && newRow < m && newCol >= 0 && newCol < n && 
                maze[newRow][newCol] === '.' && !visited[newRow][newCol]) {
                visited[newRow][newCol] = true;
                
                if (newRow === 0 || newRow === m - 1 || newCol === 0 || newCol === n - 1) {
                    return steps + 1; // Found the nearest exit
                }
                
                queue.push([newRow, newCol, steps + 1]);
            }
        }
    }
    
    return -1; // No exit found
}
```

## Time Complexity & Space Complexity
1. **Time Complexity**: `O(m * n)`, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the maze. In the worst case, we might need to explore every cell.
2. **Space Complexity**: `O(m * n)` for the `visited` array and the queue storage in the worst case scenario.
