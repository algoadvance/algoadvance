[Leetcode 2616. Minimize the Maximum Difference of Pairs](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2616)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` and an integer `pairs`. You need to form `pairs` number of pairs `(a, b)` from the elements of the array. Your goal is to minimize the maximum difference between pairs. The difference between a pair `(a, b)` is defined as `|a - b|`.

Return the minimum possible value of the maximum difference.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Q**: Can an element of the array be part of more than one pair?
   **A**: No, each element can be part of only one pair.

2. **Q**: What is the range of the values in the array and the value of `pairs`?
   **A**: The array's length can be up to `10^5` and elements are integers. `pairs` will be a positive integer.

3. **Q**: Can the array contain duplicates?
   **A**: Yes, the array can contain duplicate values.

4. **Q**: What if forming the required `pairs` is not possible?
   **A**: The problem guarantees that it's always possible to form the required number of pairs.

5. **Q**: How should we handle odd number of elements in the array?
   **A**: Since the problem guarantees that it's always possible to form the required number of pairs, it implicitly means the array will always contain an even number of elements times `2 * pairs`.

## Strategy

1. **Sorting**: First, sort the array. This typically helps in minimizing differences since close numbers appear together.
2. **Binary Search**: Use binary search on the possible values of the maximum difference to find the minimal possible maximum difference.
3. **Greedy Pairing**: For each mid value in the binary search, use a greedy approach to form pairs to validate if it's possible to form the given number of pairs with the maximum difference less than or equal to `mid`.

## Code

```javascript
function minimizeMaxDifference(nums, pairs) {
    nums.sort((a, b) => a - b);

    let left = 0;
    let right = nums[nums.length - 1] - nums[0];

    const canFormPairs = (maxDiff) => {
        let count = 0;
        for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if (nums[i] - nums[i - 1] <= maxDiff) {
                count++;
                i++; // Skip the next element since it forms a pair with the current
            }
        }
        return count >= pairs;
    };

    while (left < right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        if (canFormPairs(mid)) {
            right = mid;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }

    return left;
}
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Sorting**: The array is sorted at the beginning, which takes `O(n log n)`.
2. **Binary Search**: The binary search runs in `O(log(max_diff))` where `max_diff` is the difference between the maximum and minimum array elements.
3. **Pairing Check**: The `canFormPairs` function runs in `O(n)`.

Overall, the time complexity is dominated by the sort operation, making it `O(n log n)`.

This algorithm is efficient and should work well within the provided constraints.
