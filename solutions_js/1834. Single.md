[Leetcode 1834. Single](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1834)
### Problem Statement
You are given `n` tasks labeled from `0` to `n - 1` represented by a 2D integer array `tasks`, where `tasks[i] = [enqueueTimei, processingTimei]` means that the `i^th` task will be available to process at `enqueueTimei` and will take `processingTimei` to finish processing.

You have a single-threaded CPU that can process at most one task at a time and will act in the following way:

1. If the CPU is idle and there are no available tasks to process, the CPU stays idle.
2. If the CPU is idle and there are available tasks, it will choose the one with the shortest processing time. If multiple tasks have the same processing time, it will choose the task with the smallest index.
3. Once a task is started, the CPU will process the entire task without stopping.
4. The CPU can make these decisions in an arbitrary unit of time.

Return the order in which the CPU will process the tasks.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Will all tasks be available at some point, i.e., do all tasks have non-negative enqueue times?
2. Can we assume that the input `tasks` will always be a non-empty list of tasks?
3. Can there be tasks with zero processing time?
4. Do the tasks within the `tasks` array need to be processed in the exact order, or just as given by the constraints?
5. What's the maximum number of tasks (`n`) we can have (for performance considerations)?

### Code

```javascript
function getOrder(tasks) {
    // Augment the tasks with their original indices
    let indexedTasks = tasks.map((task, index) => [...task, index]);

    // Sort the tasks based on their enqueue time
    indexedTasks.sort((a, b) => a[0] - b[0]);

    // Min-heap for processing
    let minHeap = new MinPriorityQueue({
        priority: task => task[1],  // Processing time is the priority
        compare: (a, b) => a[1] === b[1] ? a[2] - b[2] : a[1] - b[1] // If priority same, compare by index
    });

    let result = [];
    let time = 0;
    let index = 0;
    let n = tasks.length;

    while (result.length < n) {
        // Add all tasks that have been enqueued by the current time to the heap
        while (index < n && indexedTasks[index][0] <= time) {
            minHeap.enqueue(indexedTasks[index]);
            index++;
        }

        if (!minHeap.isEmpty()) {
            // Get the task with the smallest processing time (and smallest index if tie)
            let nextTask = minHeap.dequeue().element;
            time += nextTask[1];
            result.push(nextTask[2]);
        } else {
            // If no tasks are available, jump to the next task's enqueue time
            if (index < n) {
                time = indexedTasks[index][0];
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
}
```

### Strategy
1. **Augment Tasks with Indices**: Since we need to return the original task indices in the end, we first create a new array `indexedTasks` where each task is augmented with its original index.
2. **Sort by Enqueue Time**: Sort `indexedTasks` primarily by `enqueueTime`.
3. **Min-Heap for Processing**: Use a min-heap to manage tasks that are ready to be processed. The min-heap helps in getting the task with the smallest processing time, and in case of a tie, the task with the smallest index.
4. **Simulation Loop**:
    - **Enqueue Tasks to the Heap**: Continuously add tasks to the heap that are available up to the current `time`.
    - **Process Tasks**: If there are tasks in the heap, process the one with the smallest processing time, updating the current time.
    - **Idle Time Handling**: If no tasks are available, jump the time to the next task's enqueue time.
    - Continue until all tasks are processed.

### Time Complexity
- **Sorting**: The initial sorting of tasks takes `O(n log n)`.
- **Heap Operations**: Each task enqueue and dequeue operation takes `O(log n)` and with `n` tasks, this results in `O(n log n)`.
- **Overall**: Combining these, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n)`, where `n` is the number of tasks.

This ensures efficient processing of tasks and should perform well given the constraints typically found in coding interview problems.
