[Leetcode 2478. Number of Beautiful Partitions](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2478)
### Problem Statement

You are given a string `s` of length `n`, an integer `k` and an integer `minLength`.

A partition of `s` is called **beautiful** if:
- `s` is partitioned into `k` non-overlapping substrings.
- Each substring is of length at least `minLength`.
- For each substring, the first character from the left should be a prime digit or divisible by a prime digit (`2`, `3`, `5`, and `7`).
- The last character from the left should not be a prime digit or divisible by a prime digit (`2`, `3`, `5`, and `7`).

Return the number of beautiful partitions of `s`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the constraints on `n`, `k`, and `minLength`?**
   This will help in understanding the potential for optimization.
   
2. **What should be done if the string contains characters that are not digits?**
   To clarify if the input string is always numeric.
   
3. **Can the substrings overlap?**
   Though the problem says non-overlapping, this could be explicitly confirmed.

### Strategy

1. **Prime Digit Checking**:
   Develop a helper function to check if a character is a prime digit.
   
2. **Iterative Partitioning**:
   Employ a dynamic programming approach to manage the slicing of the string.
   
3. **Recursive Subpartitioning**:
   Use recursion or an iterative loop to create partitions of at least `minLength`.

4. **Boundary Validation**:
   Ensure that the first and last characters of each substring meet the required conditions.

5. **Dynamic Programming/Table**
   Use a DP table to store results of subproblems to optimize repetitive calculations.

### Code

Here is a possible implementation of the solution:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {number} k
 * @param {number} minLength
 * @return {number}
 */
var beautifulPartitions = function(s, k, minLength) {
    const n = s.length;
    const primeDigits = new Set(['2', '3', '5', '7']);
    const notPrimeDigits = new Set(['0', '1', '4', '6', '8', '9']);
    
    // Helper function to check for beautiful partition
    const isBeautiful = (str) => {
        return primeDigits.has(str[0]) && notPrimeDigits.has(str[str.length - 1]);
    }
    
    // Initial DP array
    const dp = Array.from({ length: n + 1 }, () => Array(k + 1).fill(0));
    dp[0][0] = 1;
    
    for (let i = minLength; i <= n; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j <= k; j++) {
            for (let m = minLength; m <= i; m++) {
                if (isBeautiful(s.slice(i - m, i))) {
                    dp[i][j] += dp[i - m][j - 1];
                }
            }
        }
    }
    
    return dp[n][k];
};

// Example Usage
console.log(beautifulPartitions("235610971", 3, 2));  // Output based on the defined criteria
```

### Time Complexity

- **Outer Loops**: The 2 outer loops run over the length of the string `n` and the partitions `k`.
- **Inner Loop**: The innermost loop runs for each potential subpartition length, making the worst-case complexity `O(n^3 * k)`.

This time complexity can be significant for large `n`, but for moderate sizes, this approach should be efficient enough. If further optimization is needed, consider memoization to avoid repeated subcomputations.
