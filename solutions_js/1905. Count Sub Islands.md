[Leetcode 1905. Count Sub Islands](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1905)
## Problem Statement

The problem is described on LeetCode as follows:

You are given two `m x n` binary matrices `grid1` and `grid2` containing only `0`s (representing water) and `1`s (representing land). An island is a group of `1`s connected **4-directionally** (horizontal or vertical). You need to determine the number of islands in `grid2` that are **sub-islands** of islands in `grid1`.

An island in `grid2` is considered a sub-island if every cell of the island in `grid2` is also a part of an island in `grid1`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can both grids have different island shapes?**
   - Yes, both grids can have different configurations of islands.

2. **What are the dimensions constraints for the grids?**
   - Both grids `grid1` and `grid2` have dimensions `m x n`, where `m` and `n` are integers such that `1 <= m, n <= 500`.

3. **What should be the output if either of the grids is completely water?**
   - In that case, the output should be `0` because there are no sub-islands.

4. **Can islands in `grid2` be partially overlapping with islands in `grid1`?**
   - Yes, but for an island in `grid2` to be considered a sub-island, every `1` in the island must correspond to a `1` in `grid1`.

## Strategy

1. **Traversal and Marking:**
   - Use Depth First Search (DFS) to traverse each island in `grid2`.
   - During the traversal, check if each cell belonging to an island in `grid2` maps to a `1` in `grid1`.
   - If found to be a valid sub-island, count it.

2. **Detailed Steps:**
   - Define a DFS function to mark the cells visited in `grid2`.
   - Use a loop to start a DFS from every unvisited land cell (`1`) in `grid2`.
   - During the DFS, check if every cell visited in `grid2` is also land in `grid1`.
   - Increase the count of sub-islands if all visited cells in `grid2` correspond to cells with `1` in `grid1`.

## Code

```javascript
function countSubIslands(grid1, grid2) {
    const m = grid1.length;
    const n = grid1[0].length;

    function dfs(i, j) {
        if (i < 0 || j < 0 || i >= m || j >= n || grid2[i][j] === 0) {
            return true;
        }
        grid2[i][j] = 0;  // Mark as visited
        let res = grid1[i][j] === 1;
        res = dfs(i + 1, j) & res;
        res = dfs(i - 1, j) & res;
        res = dfs(i, j + 1) & res;
        res = dfs(i, j - 1) & res;
        return res;
    }

    let subIslandCount = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (grid2[i][j] === 1 && dfs(i, j)) {
                subIslandCount++;
            }
        }
    }
    return subIslandCount;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(m \times n)\)
  - We traverse the entire grid2, and each cell is visited once, leading to an overall linear complexity relative to the number of cells in the grid.
  
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(m \times n)\)
  - This is due to the space used by the recursion stack during DFS in the worst case when the depth of recursion might be proportional to the total number of cells.

This solution ensures that we only count sub-islands where every part of the island in `grid2` aligns with the corresponding part of an island in `grid1`.
