[Leetcode 654. Maximum Binary Tree](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l654)
### Problem Statement
You are given an integer array `nums` with no duplicates. A maximum binary tree can be built recursively from `nums` using the following algorithm:

1. Create a root node whose value is the maximum value in `nums`.
2. Recursively build the left subtree on the subarray prefix to the left of the maximum value.
3. Recursively build the right subtree on the subarray suffix to the right of the maximum value.

Return the maximum binary tree built from `nums`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the expected output?**
   - The expected output is the root of the maximum binary tree built from the input array.

2. **Are there any constraints on the input array?**
   - Yes, the array `nums` contains no duplicates.

3. **Is there a maximum size for the input array?**
   - Typically, arrays fit within the constraints of normal coding environments, like up to 10000 elements.

4. **What should be the structure of the tree node?**
   - Each tree node should have three attributes: `val` for the value, and `left` and `right` for the child nodes.

### Strategy

1. **Create the TreeNode class:**
   - The class should have a constructor that initializes `val`, `left`, and `right`.

2. **Recursive Function to Construct the Tree:**
   - Find the maximum value in the current array segment and create the root node.
   - Recursively construct the left subtree from the elements to the left of the maximum value.
   - Recursively construct the right subtree from the elements to the right of the maximum value.

3. **Base Case for Recursion:**
   - If the array or subarray is empty, return `null`.

### Code

```javascript
// TreeNode class definition
function TreeNode(val, left = null, right = null) {
    this.val = val;
    this.left = left;
    this.right = right;
}

const constructMaximumBinaryTree = (nums) => {
    // Base case: if the input array is empty, return null
    if (nums.length === 0) {
        return null;
    }
    
    // Find the maximum value and its index
    let maxIndex = 0;
    for (let i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
        if (nums[i] > nums[maxIndex]) {
            maxIndex = i;
        }
    }
    
    // Create the root node with the maximum value
    let root = new TreeNode(nums[maxIndex]);
    
    // Recursively build the left and right subtrees
    root.left = constructMaximumBinaryTree(nums.slice(0, maxIndex));
    root.right = constructMaximumBinaryTree(nums.slice(maxIndex + 1));
    
    return root;
};

// Example usage:
// Input: nums = [3,2,1,6,0,5]
// Output: returns the root of the maximum binary tree
```

### Time Complexity

- **Finding the Maximum:** Finding the maximum element in a subarray takes O(n) time.
- **Subarray Creation:** Recursively creating subarrays and constructing the tree also takes a cumulative O(n^2) in the worst case where the tree is skewed.

### Summary

- The proposed solution uses a recursive approach to build the maximum binary tree.
- This solution has a time complexity of O(n^2) because each call finds the maximum in a shrinking subarray.
- To optimize for larger arrays, an alternative data structure or algorithm can be considered (e.g., using a monotonic stack to optimize the maximum finding process).
