[Leetcode 530. Minimum Absolute Difference in BST](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l530)
## Problem Statement

Given the root of a Binary Search Tree (BST), return the minimum absolute difference between the values of any two different nodes in the tree.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the range of values for the nodes in the BST?**
   - The values are integers within the range \([-10^4, 10^4]\).

2. **Is it guaranteed that the BST has at least two nodes?**
   - Yes, you can assume the BST will have at least two nodes.

3. **Can the tree structure be unbalanced?**
   - Yes, the tree can be unbalanced.

4. **Do we need to consider the properties of BST (specifically, the in-order traversal will yield a sorted list)?**
   - Yes, utilizing in-order traversal will be useful since it yields a sorted list of values for a BST.

### Strategy

1. Perform an in-order traversal of the BST to get a sorted array of the node values.
2. Calculate the minimum absolute difference between consecutive elements in this sorted array.

### Code

```javascript
function TreeNode(val, left, right) {
    this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
    this.left = (left===undefined ? null : left);
    this.right = (right===undefined ? null : right);
}

var getMinimumDifference = function(root) {
    let prev = null;
    let minDiff = Infinity;

    const inOrderTraversal = (node) => {
        if (!Node) {
            return;
        }

        inOrderTraversal(node.left);

        if (prev !== null) {
            minDiff = Math.min(minDiff, Math.abs(node.val - prev));
        }
        prev = node.val;

        inOrderTraversal(node.right);
    };

    inOrderTraversal(root);
    return minDiff;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **In-order Traversal:** O(n) - where n is the number of nodes in the BST. We visit each node exactly once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(h) - where h is the height of the tree. This accounts for the recursion stack during the traversal. In the worst case, for a completely unbalanced tree, h could be as large as n. For a balanced tree, h would be log(n).
