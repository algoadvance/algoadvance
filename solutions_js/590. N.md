[Leetcode 590. N](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l590)
### Problem Statement

You are given an n-ary tree. Implement a function to perform postorder traversal on the tree and return the values of the nodes in the correct order.

Postorder traversal for an n-ary tree is defined as follows:

1. Traverse all the children from left to right.
2. Visit the root node.

Here is the formal definition:
```javascript
function postorder(root: Node | null): number[] {}
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the structure of the Node class?**
   - The class is defined as follows:
     ```javascript
     class Node {
         val: number;
         children: Node[];
         constructor(val?: number, children?: Node[]) {
             this.val = (val===undefined ? 0 : val);
             this.children = (children===undefined ? [] : children);
         }
     }
     ```

2. **What should be returned if the root is null?**
   - An empty array should be returned.

### Strategy

To perform a postorder traversal on an n-ary tree, we can use both recursive and iterative approaches:

1. **Recursive Approach**:
   - Create a helper function that traverses all the children of a node recursively.
   - After traversing all children, add the current node's value to the result array.
   
2. **Iterative Approach**:
   - Use a stack to simulate the recursive approach.
   - Push the node values into the stack while traversing.
   - After finishing the traversal, reverse the result to get the postorder.

Here, we will implement the **recursive approach** as it's more straightforward and elegant for tree traversal.

### Code 

```javascript
// Definition for Node.
class Node {
    constructor(val, children) {
        this.val = val;
        this.children = children || [];
    }
}

/**
 * @param {Node|null} root
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var postorder = function(root) {
    const result = [];
    
    function traverse(node) {
        if (node === null) return;
        
        for (let child of node.children) {
            traverse(child);
        }
        
        result.push(node.val);
    }
    
    traverse(root);
    return result;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(N), where N is the number of nodes in the tree. Each node is visited exactly once.

- **Space Complexity**: O(N) in both the worst-case scenario for the recursion call stack (if the tree is a deep single chain) and the result array.

Using this solution, the correct postorder traversal of an n-ary tree can be achieved efficiently.
