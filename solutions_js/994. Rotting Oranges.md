[Leetcode 994. Rotting Oranges](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l994)
### Problem Statement

You are given an `m x n` grid where each cell can have one of three values:

- `0` representing an empty cell,
- `1` representing a fresh orange, or
- `2` representing a rotten orange.

Every minute, any fresh orange that is adjacent (4-directionally) to a rotten orange becomes rotten.

Return the minimum number of minutes that must elapse until no cell has a fresh orange. If this is impossible, return `-1`.

### Example
```plaintext
Input: grid = [[2,1,1],[1,1,0],[0,1,1]]
Output: 4
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. What should be returned if the grid is empty?
   - If the grid is empty, return `0` as there are no oranges to process.
2. Are diagonal cells considered adjacent?
   - No, only up, down, left, and right cells are considered adjacent.
3. Can there be multiple rotten oranges initially?
   - Yes, the initial state of rot could be at multiple locations.

### Strategy

1. Use Breadth-First Search (BFS) to simulate the rotting process:
   - Start by adding all initially rotten oranges to a queue.
   - Track the minutes elapsed.
   - For each orange in the queue, rot its fresh adjacent cells, adding those new rotten oranges to the queue.
   - Continue until no more fresh oranges can be rotted.
2. If there are still fresh oranges left after the BFS process, return `-1`.

### Code

```javascript
function orangesRotting(grid) {
    if (grid === null || grid.length === 0) return 0;

    let rows = grid.length;
    let cols = grid[0].length;
    let queue = [];
    let freshCount = 0;
    let minutesElapsed = 0;

    // Initialize the queue with all initially rotten oranges and count fresh oranges.
    for (let r = 0; r < rows; r++) {
        for (let c = 0; c < cols; c++) {
            if (grid[r][c] === 2) {
                queue.push([r, c]);
            } else if (grid[r][c] === 1) {
                freshCount++;
            }
        }
    }

    // Directions array for 4 adjacent cells (left, right, up, down)
    const directions = [[0, 1], [1, 0], [0, -1], [-1, 0]];

    // BFS to start rotting process from initially rotten oranges.
    while (queue.length > 0 && freshCount > 0) {
        let size = queue.length;
        for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            let [x, y] = queue.shift();
            for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
                let newX = x + dx;
                let newY = y + dy;
                if (newX >= 0 && newX < rows && newY >= 0 && newY < cols && grid[newX][newY] === 1) {
                    grid[newX][newY] = 2;
                    queue.push([newX, newY]);
                    freshCount--;
                }
            }
        }
        minutesElapsed++;
    }

    // If there are any fresh oranges left, return -1, otherwise return elapsed minutes
    return freshCount === 0 ? minutesElapsed : -1;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(m * n) where m is the number of rows and n is the number of columns in the grid. Each cell is processed once.
- **Space Complexity:** O(m * n) for the queue which can grow to be as large as all the rotten oranges plus the potentially rotten fresh oranges.

Feel free to ask any more questions or clarify any details.
