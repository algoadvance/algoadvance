[Leetcode 1655. Distribute Repeating Integers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1655)
## Problem Statement
You are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `k`. You need to determine if it's possible to distribute all integers in the `nums` array into exactly `k` groups such that each group contains unique integers and each integer from the `nums` array is included in exactly one group.

### Example:

```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 1
Output: true
Explanation: Since k is 1, we can put all numbers into the single group [1,2,3,4].
```

```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,2,3,4], k = 2
Output: true
Explanation: We can divide the array into 2 groups: [1,2] and [3,4].
```

```plaintext
Input: nums = [1,2,3,3], k = 2
Output: false
Explanation: We can't divide the array into 2 groups where each group keeps unique numbers.
```

## Clarification Questions

1. **Constraints**: What are the constraints on the values of `nums` and `k`?
    - We need to know the range for performance purposes.

2. **Complete Usage**: Should all integers from `nums` be used?
   - Yes, each integer must be included exactly once in the partitions.

3. **Zeros and Negatives**: Are there any special considerations for zeroes or negative numbers?
   - Generally, these don't affect the logic but knowing that `nums` only contains positive integers would simplify understanding.

4. **Edge Cases**: What if `nums` is empty or `k` is zero?
   - `nums` being empty and any value of `k` should just return `false` since we canâ€™t form any group if there are no elements.

## Strategy
1. **Frequency Count**: First, count the frequency of each integer in the `nums` array.
2. **Binary Search Approach**: We'll recognize that the decision problem (can we distribute the integers into `k` groups?) can be solved by trying different maximum group sizes and using binary search to home in on the possible solution.
3. **Helper Function**: We need a helper function to check if it's possible to distribute the numbers into `k` groups given a certain maximum group size per integer.

## Time Complexity
The solution will involve calculating the frequency count (O(n)). The binary search approach will have a logarithmic component O(logS) where S is the sum of all frequencies. Each check during binary search (using the helper function) involves dividing integers into groups, which can take up to O(n). Therefore, the time complexity should be around O(n logS).

## Code

Here is the JavaScript solution:

```javascript
function canDistribute(nums, k) {
    let frequency = new Map();
    
    // Calculate frequency of each number
    for (let num of nums) {
        if (!frequency.has(num)) {
            frequency.set(num, 0);
        }
        frequency.set(num, frequency.get(num) + 1);
    }
    
    let freqArray = Array.from(frequency.values()).sort((a, b) => b - a);

    // Binary Search for the minimum possible maximum group size
    let left = 1, right = nums.length;
    
    const canFormGroups = (groups, maxGroupSize) => {
        let count = 0;
        for (let freq of freqArray) {
            count += Math.ceil(freq / maxGroupSize);
            if (count > groups) return false;
        }
        return count <= groups;
    };

    while (left < right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        if (canFormGroups(k, mid)) {
            right = mid;
        } else {
            left = mid + 1;
        }
    }
    return canFormGroups(k, left);
}

// Usage
console.log(canDistribute([1,2,3,4], 1)); // true
console.log(canDistribute([1,2,3,4], 2)); // true
console.log(canDistribute([1,2,3,3], 2)); // false
```

In this code, we first compute the frequency of each integer using a Map. We then convert the frequency map to an array sorted in descending order. Using a binary search, we check if it's possible to distribute the integers into `k` groups under the current mid value and adjust our search range accordingly until we find the optimal solution.
