[Leetcode 971. Flip Binary Tree To Match Preorder Traversal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l971)
### Problem Statement

Given a binary tree with `N` nodes, each node in the tree has a unique value from `1` to `N`. The tree is given with a potentially incorrect preorder traversal. Your task is to flip the tree nodes’ left and right children so the resulting tree's preorder traversal matches the given incorrect preorder traversal.

Return the list of node values that need to be flipped to match the correct preorder traversal. A flip means swapping the left and right child nodes at that specific node. If it is impossible to match the preorder traversal, return the list containing only `-1`.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: root = [1,2,3], voyage = [1,3,2]
Output: [1]
```

**Constraints:**
- The number of nodes in the tree will be in the range `[1, 100]`.
- Each node will have a unique value from `1` to `N`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input preorder traversal (voyage) be empty?**
   - No, if there’s a tree, there’s at least one node, so the preorder traversal cannot be empty.

2. **Are the values in the voyage list guaranteed to be unique and valid node values from the tree?**
   - Yes, each value from `1` to `N` corresponds to a unique node in the tree.

3. **Can we have trees with only one node?**
   - Yes, single-node trees are valid inputs too.

### Code

Let's implement the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function flipMatchVoyage(root, voyage) {
    let index = 0;
    let result = [];
    
    function dfs(node) {
        if (!node) return true;
        
        // If the current node value does not match the voyage's current value, it's impossible to match
        if (node.val != voyage[index]) return false;
        
        index++;
        
        // If the next value in the voyage array does not match the left child's value
        if (node.left && node.left.val != voyage[index]) {
            // Flip is required, swap left and right children
            result.push(node.val);
            return dfs(node.right) && dfs(node.left);
        }
        
        // Continue to the left child and right child
        return dfs(node.left) && dfs(node.right);
    }
    
    return dfs(root) ? result : [-1];
}
```

### Strategy
1. **Initialize Index and Result List:** 
   - Start with an index `index` at 0 which will help traverse the voyage array.
   - Use `result` to keep track of nodes where flips are required.

2. **Depth-First Search (DFS):**
   - Implement a DFS to traverse the tree starting from the root.
   - Check if the node value matches the current voyage value (`voyage[index]`). If not, return false indicating it's impossible to match.
   - Increment the index to process the next element in the voyage.
   - Determine if a flip is needed by comparing the current node's children with the next value in the voyage.
   - If the next value matches the right child's value instead of the left child's, perform a flip by adding the node value to `result` and swap the order of DFS traversal (visit right child before left child).

3. **Return the Result:**
   - If DFS traversal completes successfully matching the entire voyage, return `result` containing flip nodes.
   - If any mismatch is found during traversal, return `[-1]`.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(N)` where `N` is the number of nodes in the tree.
  - Each node is visited exactly once during the DFS traversal.

- **Space Complexity:** `O(N)` due to the recursion stack and the `result` array potentially holding up to `N` flipped nodes.
