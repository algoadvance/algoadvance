[Leetcode 2290. Minimum Obstacle Removal to Reach Corner](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2290)
### Problem Statement

You are given a `m x n` grid. Each cell in the grid has a certain value representing obstacles. You can move up, down, left, or right. Your task is to find the minimum number of obstacles you need to remove to travel from the top-left corner `(0, 0)` to the bottom-right corner `(m-1, n-1)`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What values can the grid cells contain?**
   - The grid cells can contain only `0` (no obstacle) or `1` (obstacle).

2. **Can we move diagonally?**
   - No, you can only move up, down, left, or right.

3. **What are the dimensions of the grid?**
   - The grid dimensions are `m x n`, where `m` and `n` are the number of rows and columns respectively.

4. **What should we return if there is no possible way to reach the destination?**
   - We should return `-1` if it's impossible to reach the destination.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we can use a Breadth-First Search (BFS) approach combined with a priority queue (or deque) to simulate a 0-1 BFS. This will allow us to efficiently prioritize the paths that encounter fewer obstacles. The idea is to use a deque where we will add cells that contain `0` to the front (since they require no removal and are thus cheaper) and cells that contain `1` to the back (as they require an obstacle removal).

### Code

```javascript
function minimumObstacles(grid) {
    const m = grid.length, n = grid[0].length;
    const directions = [[0, 1], [1, 0], [0, -1], [-1, 0]];
    const deque = [];
    const distance = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(Infinity));
    deque.push([0, 0]);
    distance[0][0] = 0;

    while (deque.length > 0) {
        const [x, y] = deque.shift();
        
        for (const [dx, dy] of directions) {
            const nx = x + dx;
            const ny = y + dy;

            if (nx >= 0 && ny >= 0 && nx < m && ny < n) {
                const newDist = distance[x][y] + grid[nx][ny];
                if (newDist < distance[nx][ny]) {
                    distance[nx][ny] = newDist;
                    if (grid[nx][ny] === 0) {
                        deque.unshift([nx, ny]);  // Add to front if no obstacle
                    } else {
                        deque.push([nx, ny]);  // Add to back if there is an obstacle
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return distance[m-1][n-1] === Infinity ? -1 : distance[m-1][n-1];
}
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this algorithm is **O(m * n)**. This is mainly because each cell will be processed at most twice (once when added to the front of the deque and once when added to the back). The space complexity is also **O(m * n)** due to the storage of the distance array and the deque.


This approach ensures that we find the path with the minimum number of obstacles by always processing the cheapest cells first, which makes it an efficient solution to the problem.
