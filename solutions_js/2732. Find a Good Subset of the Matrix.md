[Leetcode 2732. Find a Good Subset of the Matrix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2732)
### Problem Statement
You are given a binary matrix `grid` of size `m x n`. A subset of `rows` of the matrix is good if no two rows within this subset share a `1` in the same column.

Return **any good subset** of row indices of the matrix. If no good subset exists, return an empty list.

A row index `i` is considered to be zero-based.

### Clarifying Questions
1. Should the subset include all the rows where no two rows have `1` in the same column?
2. Can we assume that the input will always be valid (i.e., a proper binary matrix)?
3. Is there any constraint on the size of the subset we need to find?

### Code
Here's how we can start tackling this problem:

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} grid
 * @return {number[]}
 */
var goodSubset = function(grid) {
    const m = grid.length;
    const n = grid[0].length;

    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = i + 1; j < m; j++) {
            let conflict = false;
            for (let k = 0; k < n; k++) {
                if (grid[i][k] === 1 && grid[j][k] === 1) {
                    conflict = true;
                    break;
                }
            }
            if (!conflict) {
                return [i, j];
            }
        }
    }
    return [];
};

// Example usage:
let grid = [
    [1, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 1]
];
console.log(goodSubset(grid));  // Output example: [0, 1], or any pair that has no conflicting columns
```

### Strategy
1. **Iterate through all pairs of rows**: For every pair of rows in matrix `grid`, we check if the pair is a "good subset".
2. **Check for conflicts**: For the given pair of rows, check if they have a `1` in the same column. If they don't, we've found a good subset and return the indices of those rows.
3. **Return result**: If no such pair exists, return an empty list.

### Time Complexity
1. The outer loop runs in O(m^2) time where `m` is the number of rows as it has nested loops iterating over `m` rows.
2. The inner loop checks each element of the row, which runs in O(n) where `n` is the number of columns.

**Total Time Complexity**: O(m^2 * n)
