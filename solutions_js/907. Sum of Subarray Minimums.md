[Leetcode 907. Sum of Subarray Minimums](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l907)
### Problem Statement:
Given an array of integers `arr`, find the sum of `min(b)`, where `b` ranges over every (contiguous) subarray of `arr`. Since the answer may be large, return the answer modulo 10^9 + 7.

### Clarifying Questions:
1. **Range of Input Array**: What is the length and range of the elements in the input array?
   - The array length can be up to 30,000.
   - The elements of the array can range from 1 to 30000.
  
2. **Modulo Operation**: Do we need to apply the modulo operation at every step or just at the end?
   - It is safe to apply the modulo operation at every step to avoid overflow.

### Code Strategy:
Here's a strategy to solve this problem efficiently:

1. **Understanding Subarrays**: We need to consider every subarray and compute the minimum of each. However, directly computing the minimum for each subarray would be too slow (O(n^3)).
  
2. **Stack-based Approach**: Instead, we can leverage a stack-based approach to find out the contribution of each element as the minimum element in the subarrays.
   - For each element, determine how many subarrays in which it is the minimum element.
   - Use two arrays `left` and `right` to store the number of subarrays where the element at index `i` is the smallest on its left and right respectively.

3. **Contribution Calculation**: The product of the counts from `left` and `right` will give the total subarrays where `arr[i]` is the minimum element. Sum these contributions to get the result.

4. **Modulo Operation**: Apply modulo 10^9 + 7 at relevant steps to handle large numbers.

### Code:
Below is the implementation of the above strategy in JavaScript:

```javascript
function sumSubarrayMins(arr) {
    const MOD = 1e9 + 7;
    const n = arr.length;
    
    const left = new Array(n).fill(0);
    const right = new Array(n).fill(0);
    
    // Stack for previous less element count
    let stack = [];
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        let count = 1;
        while (stack.length && stack[stack.length - 1][0] > arr[i]) {
            count += stack.pop()[1];
        }
        left[i] = count;
        stack.push([arr[i], count]);
    }
    
    // Stack for next less element count
    stack = [];
    for (let i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
        let count = 1;
        while (stack.length && stack[stack.length - 1][0] >= arr[i]) {
            count += stack.pop()[1];
        }
        right[i] = count;
        stack.push([arr[i], count]);
    }
    
    let result = 0;
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        result = (result + arr[i] * left[i] * right[i]) % MOD;
    }
    
    return result;
}

// Example Usage
const arr = [3, 1, 2, 4];
console.log(sumSubarrayMins(arr)); // Output: 17
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the number of elements in the array. This is because each element is pushed and popped from the stack at most once.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) for the `left`, `right` arrays, and the stack.

This approach ensures that we efficiently calculate the sum of subarray minimums in linear time, making it suitable for large input sizes.
