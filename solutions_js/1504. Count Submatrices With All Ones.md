[Leetcode 1504. Count Submatrices With All Ones](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1504)
### Problem Statement
Given an `m x n` binary matrix `mat`, return the number of submatrices that have all ones.

**Example:**
```plaintext
Input: [[1,0,1],
        [1,1,0],
        [1,1,0]]
Output: 13
```
Explanation: 
There are 6 submatrices with size 1x1, 6 submatrices with size 1x2, and 1 submatrix with size 2x2 which all contain only ones.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Q1:** Can the matrix contain only zeros or only ones?
   **A1:** Yes, the matrix can contain any combination of zeros and ones.
2. **Q2:** Is there an upper limit on the dimensions of the matrix?
   **A2:** While there isn't an explicit upper limit provided, typical constraints might be the dimensions of `m` and `n` being up to 1000 for computational feasibility.

### Strategy
1. **Step 1:** Calculate the heights of consecutive ones for each column.
    - This helps to visualize the submatrices in a more comprehensible way while reducing redundancy.
2. **Step 2:** Use a histogram-like approach for each row.
    - Compute the number of submatrices ending at each cell using the height array.

### Code
```javascript
var numSubmat = function(mat) {
    let m = mat.length;
    let n = mat[0].length;
    let heights = Array(m).fill(null).map(() => Array(n).fill(0));
    let result = 0;

    // Compute the consecutive height of 1's column-wise
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < m; j++) {
            if (mat[j][i] == 1) {
                heights[j][i] = j == 0 ? 1 : heights[j - 1][i] + 1;
            } else {
                heights[j][i] = 0;
            }
        }
    }

    // Calculate the number of submatrices with all ones
    for (let i = 0; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < n; j++) {
            if (heights[i][j] > 0) {
                let min_height = heights[i][j];
                for (let k = j; k >= 0; k--) {
                    if (heights[i][k] == 0) break;
                    min_height = Math.min(min_height, heights[i][k]);
                    result += min_height;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    return result;
};
```

### Time Complexity
- **Height Calculation:** O(m * n) - Each element is processed once to calculate heights.
- **Counting Submatrices:** O(m * n^2) - For each cell, in the worst case, we might need to check all previous columns to determine the number of submatrices ending at that cell.

### Summary
- The proposed solution calculates the submatrices containing all ones by first preparing the heights array.
- It then computes the count efficiently by leveraging the height information to avoid redundant checks.
- The overall complexity ensures we handle moderately large matrices efficiently while providing an accurate count.
