[Leetcode 911. Online Election](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l911)
### Problem Statement

You are given two arrays, `persons` and `times`. The `persons` array represents the winning candidate at each point in time, and the `times` array represents the corresponding time points. Implement the `TopVotedCandidate` class which should support the following method:

- `TopVotedCandidate(int[] persons, int[] times)`: Initializes the object with the `persons` and `times` arrays.
- `int q(int t)`: Returns the candidate that was leading the vote at time `t`. If two or more candidates were tied in the lead, the most recent one wins.

### Clarifying Questions

1. Will the `times` array always be in non-decreasing order?
2. Can two consecutive entries in the `times` array have the same value?
3. Are there any constraints on the values of the elements in `persons` and `times` arrays?

Assuming:
1. Yes, `times` is in non-decreasing order.
2. No, each entry in `times` is unique.
3. The constraints for the problem as per LeetCode are:
   - `1 <= persons.length == times.length <= 5000`
   - `0 <= persons[i] < 5000`
   - `times` is strictly increasing
   - `times[i] <= 10^9`
   - `t <= 10^9`

### Strategy

1. Use a dictionary to count the votes for each candidate.
2. Track the leading candidate at each time point using a list of tuples `(time, leader)`.
3. For the `q` method, utilize binary search to efficiently find the leader at or before time `t`.

### Code

```javascript
class TopVotedCandidate {
    constructor(persons, times) {
        this.leaderAtTimes = [];
        this.voteCounts = new Map();
        this.persons = persons;
        this.times = times;
        
        let currentLeader = -1;
        for (let i = 0; i < persons.length; i++) {
            let person = persons[i];
            let time = times[i];
            if (!this.voteCounts.has(person)) {
                this.voteCounts.set(person, 0);
            }
            let newVoteCount = this.voteCounts.get(person) + 1;
            this.voteCounts.set(person, newVoteCount);
            
            if (currentLeader === -1 || newVoteCount >= this.voteCounts.get(currentLeader)) {
                currentLeader = person;
            }
            this.leaderAtTimes.push([time, currentLeader]);
        }
    }
    
    q(t) {
        let low = 0;
        let high = this.times.length - 1;
        
        while (low < high) {
            let mid = Math.floor((low + high + 1) / 2);
            if (this.times[mid] <= t) {
                low = mid;
            } else {
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }
        
        return this.leaderAtTimes[low][1];
    }
}

// Example usage:
let persons = [0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 1, 0];
let times = [0, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30];
let topVotedCandidate = new TopVotedCandidate(persons, times);
console.log(topVotedCandidate.q(3));  // Output: 0
console.log(topVotedCandidate.q(12)); // Output: 1
console.log(topVotedCandidate.q(25)); // Output: 1
console.log(topVotedCandidate.q(15)); // Output: 0
console.log(topVotedCandidate.q(24)); // Output: 0
console.log(topVotedCandidate.q(8));  // Output: 1
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization (`TopVotedCandidate` constructor)**: O(n), where n is the number of entries in the `persons` array.
- **Query (`q` method)**: O(log n) due to binary search.

This implementation should efficiently handle the constraints provided by the problem statement.
