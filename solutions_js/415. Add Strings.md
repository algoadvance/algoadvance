[Leetcode 415. Add Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l415)
## Problem Statement
Given two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2` represented as string, return the sum of `num1` and `num2` as a string.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as BigInteger). You are also not allowed to convert the inputs to integers directly.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**: 
   - Are `num1` and `num2` guaranteed to be valid non-negative integers represented as strings?
   - Can the input strings be empty?
   
2. **Output Requirements**: 
   - Should unnecessary leading zeros in the output be removed?

Assuming `num1` and `num2` are guaranteed to be valid non-negative integers and none of the strings will be empty.

## Strategy
1. **Initialization**: Start from the end (least significant digit) of both strings.
2. **Digit-by-Digit Addition**: Using a carry variable to manage the sum of each digit including the carry from the previous step.
3. **Result Construction**: Construct the result from the least significant digit to the most significant digit.
4. **Edge Case Handling**: Ensure any remaining carry is appended.

## Code

```javascript
function addStrings(num1, num2) {
    let carry = 0;
    let res = [];

    let i = num1.length - 1;
    let j = num2.length - 1;

    while (i >= 0 || j >= 0 || carry > 0) {
        let digit1 = i >= 0 ? num1[i].charCodeAt(0) - '0'.charCodeAt(0) : 0;
        let digit2 = j >= 0 ? num2[j].charCodeAt(0) - '0'.charCodeAt(0) : 0;

        let sum = digit1 + digit2 + carry;
        carry = Math.floor(sum / 10);
        res.push((sum % 10).toString());

        i--;
        j--;
    }

    // Reverse the result as we constructed it backwards
    return res.reverse().join('');
}
```

### Explanation
- **Initialization**: 
  - `carry` keeps track of the carry-over value from each addition.
  - `res` is an array to store the sum digits.
  - `i` and `j` are pointers starting from the end of `num1` and `num2`.

- **Digit-by-Digit Addition**:
  - Convert character digits to numbers using `charCodeAt` and subtracting the char code of '0'.
  - Add the digits and the carry.
  - Calculate the new carry.
  - Store the unit digit of the sum in the result array.

- **Combining Results**:
  - After looping through all digits, reverse the result array to convert it back to normal order and join it as a string.

### Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(max(N, M)), where N and M are the lengths of `num1` and `num2`.
- **Space Complexity**: O(max(N, M)), for storing the result.

This ensures efficient handling of potentially very large numbers represented as strings without converting them directly to integers.
