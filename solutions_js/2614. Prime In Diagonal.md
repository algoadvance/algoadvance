[Leetcode 2614. Prime In Diagonal](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2614)
**Problem Statement:**

You are given an `n x n` integer matrix `mat`. Return the largest prime number in the diagonal of the matrix that extends from the top-left corner to the bottom-right corner.

A prime number is a number greater than 1 that has no positive divisors other than 1 and itself.

If there is no such prime number, return 0.

**Clarifying Questions:**

1. Is `n` guaranteed to be at least 1?
   - If `n` is 1, the diagonal has only one element.
2. Should we handle negative integers?
   - Since the definition of primes applies only to positive integers greater than 1, negative integers should be ignored when finding the largest prime number.

Letâ€™s proceed with the assumption that `n` is at least 1 and we only need to check positive integers for primes.

**Strategy:**

1. Extract the elements from the diagonal (from top-left to bottom-right).
2. Check each element to determine if it's a prime number.
3. Keep track of the largest prime number found.
4. Return 0 if no prime number is found on the diagonal.

**Code:**

```javascript
function isPrime(num) {
    if (num <= 1) return false;
    if (num <= 3) return true;
    if (num % 2 === 0 || num % 3 === 0) return false;
    for (let i = 5; i * i <= num; i += 6) {
        if (num % i === 0 || num % (i + 2) === 0) return false;
    }
    return true;
}

function largestPrimeInDiagonal(mat) {
    const n = mat.length;
    let largestPrime = 0;
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (isPrime(mat[i][i])) {
            largestPrime = Math.max(largestPrime, mat[i][i]);
        }
    }
    
    return largestPrime;
}

// Example usage:
const mat = [
    [2, 3, 5],
    [3, 5, 7],
    [5, 7, 11]
];
console.log(largestPrimeInDiagonal(mat)); // Output: 11
```

**Time Complexity:**

- **isPrime function:** The worst-case time complexity for the `isPrime` function is \(O(\sqrt{n})\), since we only need to check divisors up to the square root of the number.
- **largestPrimeInDiagonal function:** Iterates through `n` elements of the diagonal, and for each element, calls `isPrime` which can run up to \(O(\sqrt{n})\). Thus, the overall time complexity is \(O(n \sqrt{m})\), where `n` is the size of the matrix and `m` is the largest element in the matrix.

This should provide a clear and efficient solution to finding the largest prime number in the main diagonal of the given `n x n` matrix.
