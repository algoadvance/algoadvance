[Leetcode 1436. Destination City](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1436)
### Problem Statement
You are given the array `paths`, where `paths[i] = [cityAi, cityBi]` means there exists a direct path going from cityAi to cityBi. Return the destination city, that is, the city without any path outgoing to another city.

It is guaranteed that there will be exactly one destination city.

Example 1:
```
Input: paths = [["London","New York"],["New York","Lima"],["Lima","Sao Paulo"]]
Output: "Sao Paulo"
```

Example 2:
```
Input: paths = [["B","C"],["D","B"],["C","A"]]
Output: "A"
```

Example 3:
```
Input: paths = [["A","Z"]]
Output: "Z"
```

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
    - Will the input be non-empty?
    - Are there any constraints on the length of the city names or the number of paths?
2. **Output Constraints**:
    - Should we return a string representing the destination city?
    - Are there any constraints on what can be considered a city name? (e.g., can names contain special characters?)

Assuming standard constraints:
- 1 <= paths.length <= 100
- Each city name consists of lowercase and uppercase English letters and the space character.
- All path[i] (1 <= i <= paths.length) are unique.

### Strategy
1. **Extracting Cities**:
    - Create a set to store all cities with outgoing paths as `setOfCitiesWithOutgoingPath`.
    - Traverse through the list of `paths` and populate `setOfCitiesWithOutgoingPath`.
2. **Finding Destination City**:
    - Traverse through the list of `paths`, specifically the destination cities (`cityBi` in paths[i]).
    - If a `cityBi` is not in `setOfCitiesWithOutgoingPath`, it means it is our destination city.

### Code

```javascript
function destCity(paths) {
    // Create a set for cities with outgoing paths
    const setOfCitiesWithOutgoingPath = new Set();

    // Populate the set with all starting cities (cityAi)
    for (let i = 0; i < paths.length; i++) {
        setOfCitiesWithOutgoingPath.add(paths[i][0]);
    }

    // Check each destination city (cityBi) to find the one not in the set
    for (let i = 0; i < paths.length; i++) {
        if (!setOfCitiesWithOutgoingPath.has(paths[i][1])) {
            return paths[i][1];
        }
    }
}

// Example usage
console.log(destCity([["London","New York"],["New York","Lima"],["Lima","Sao Paulo"]])); // Output: "Sao Paulo"
```

### Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution is **O(n)**, where `n` is the length of the `paths` array. This is because:
- We loop through the `paths` array once to populate the `setOfCitiesWithOutgoingPath` (O(n)).
- We loop through the `paths` array again to check for the destination city (O(n)).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is O(n) + O(n) = **O(n)**.
