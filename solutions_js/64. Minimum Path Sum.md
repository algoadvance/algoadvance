[Leetcode 64. Minimum Path Sum](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l64)
## Problem Statement:
Given a `m x n` grid filled with non-negative numbers, find a path from top left to bottom right, which minimizes the sum of all numbers along its path.

You can only move either down or right at any point in time.

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **Is the grid always non-empty?**
   - Yes, the grid will have at least one cell.

2. **Can the grid contain zeros?**
   - Yes, the grid can contain zero as one of the non-negative numbers.

3. **How large can the grid be?**
   - Let's assume the grid can be up to size 200 x 200 for the purpose of this problem.

## Strategy:
To solve this problem, we can use Dynamic Programming (DP). The main idea is to build a solution using previously computed minimum paths.

1. **Initialization:**
   - Create a 2D array `dp`, where `dp[i][j]` represents the minimum path sum to reach cell `(i, j)`.

2. **Base Case:**
   - `dp[0][0]` is just the value of `grid[0][0]` because that's our starting point.

3. **Fill `dp` Table:**
   - We will fill the first row and the first column separately since those can only come from one direction (left for first row and top for first column).
   - For other cells, we can come either from the left (`dp[i][j-1]`) or from the top (`dp[i-1][j]`). The value of `dp[i][j]` will be `grid[i][j] + min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1])`.

4. **Result:**
   - The minimum path sum to the bottom-right corner of the grid will be found at `dp[m-1][n-1]`.

## Code:
```javascript
/**
 * @param {number[][]} grid
 * @return {number}
 */
const minPathSum = function(grid) {
    let m = grid.length;
    let n = grid[0].length;
    
    // Create a 2D dp array with the same dimensions as the grid
    let dp = Array.from({ length: m }, () => Array(n).fill(0));
    
    // Initialize the first cell
    dp[0][0] = grid[0][0];
    
    // Initialize the first row
    for (let j = 1; j < n; j++) {
        dp[0][j] = dp[0][j-1] + grid[0][j];
    }
    
    // Initialize the first column
    for (let i = 1; i < m; i++) {
        dp[i][0] = dp[i-1][0] + grid[i][0];
    }
    
    // Fill the rest of the dp table
    for (let i = 1; i < m; i++) {
        for (let j = 1; j < n; j++) {
            dp[i][j] = grid[i][j] + Math.min(dp[i-1][j], dp[i][j-1]);
        }
    }
    
    // The minimum path sum will be in the bottom-right corner
    return dp[m-1][n-1];
};
```

## Time Complexity:
The time complexity of this solution is **O(m * n)**, where `m` is the number of rows and `n` is the number of columns in the grid. This is because we need to fill each cell in the `dp` table once.

## Space Complexity:
The space complexity is **O(m * n)** because we use an additional 2D array `dp` of the same size as `grid`. 

In essence, this solution efficiently computes the minimum path sum using dynamic programming by building on smaller sub-problems and ensures that the steps needed to navigate through the grid are minimized.
