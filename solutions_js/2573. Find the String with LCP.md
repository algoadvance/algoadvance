[Leetcode 2573. Find the String with LCP](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2573)
### Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `words` where each string consists of lowercase English letters. Assume that there is a successive relationship between words such that each word `words[i+1]` has a longest common prefix (LCP) with `words[i]`.

Your task is to find the string in the array after removing any one of the words such that the remaining words still exhibit the same LCP characteristic. 

Return the string that should be removed.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Input size and constraints**:
   - What is the maximum length of the array `words`?
   - What is the maximum length of each string in `words`?

2. **Output uniqueness**:
   - Is it guaranteed that there will be only one valid string that can be removed?
   
3. **Special cases**:
   - What should be done if `words` contains only one or two strings?

Assuming based on common constraints:
- The array `words` would contain at least three strings.
- Each string consists of only lowercase English letters.

### Example

Given:
```javascript
words = ["flower","flow","flock","fleet"]
```
The expected output could be `"flock"` because removing it permits "flower", "flow", "fleet" to sustain a proper LCP characteristic.

### Code

First, let's consider a strategy to solve this problem.

### Strategy

1. Iterate through each word and temporarily remove it from the `words`.
2. Check if the remaining sequence still has the longest common prefix property.
3. Return the word that when removed allows the remaining sequence to preserve the longest common prefix property.

### Time Complexity

- Checking the LCP for `k` words would take O(minLength * (k-1)), where `minLength` is the length of the shortest string in the pair being compared.
- Since we're checking this for potentially all words, the overall complexity is O(n * minLength * (k-1)), where `n` is the number of words and `k` is the average number of characters per word.

Letâ€™s implement this in JavaScript.

```javascript
function findRemovedString(words) {
    function hasLCP(words) {
        for (let i = 0; i < words.length - 1; i++) {
            if (!words[i+1].startsWith(words[i][0])) {
                return false;
            }
        }
        return true;
    }

    for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
        let remainingWords = words.slice(0, i).concat(words.slice(i+1, words.length));
        if (hasLCP(remainingWords)) {
            return words[i];
        }
    }
}

// Test case
const words = ["flower","flow","flock","fleet"];
console.log(findRemovedString(words)); // Output should be "flock"
```

### Explanation

1. **hasLCP function**:
   - This function checks if the remaining words maintain a proper LCP sequence.
   - We use `startsWith` to check if each `words[i+1]` has a common prefix with `words[i]`.

2. **Main function**:
   - Iterate over each word, temporarily remove the word, and check if the rest of the list retains the LCP property by calling `hasLCP`.
   - Return the word once we find removing it retains the longest common prefix property.

This approach ensures we cover all potential cases and the function efficiently identifies the word to be removed while maintaining clarity.
