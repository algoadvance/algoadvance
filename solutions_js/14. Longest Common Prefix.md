[Leetcode 14. Longest Common Prefix](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l14)
### Problem Statement

Write a function to find the longest common prefix string amongst an array of strings.

If there is no common prefix, return an empty string "".

#### Example 1:
```
Input: strs = ["flower","flow","flight"]
Output: "fl"
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: strs = ["dog","racecar","car"]
Output: ""
Explanation: There is no common prefix among the input strings.
```

#### Constraints:
- `0 <= strs.length <= 200`
- `0 <= strs[i].length <= 200`
- `strs[i]` consists of only lower-case English letters.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be returned if the input array is empty?**
   - Return an empty string.

2. **Are all the given strings non-empty?**
   - No. Each string can also be empty.

3. **Is the comparison case-sensitive?**
   - Yes, since the problem states the strings consist of lower-case English letters, the comparison should be case-sensitive.

### Strategy

1. **Initial checks**:
   - If the array is empty, return `""`.
   - If the array has only one string, return that string.

2. **Sort the array**:
   - Sort the array to bring the strings which are lexicographically similar closer to each other.

3. **Compare only the first and the last string**:
   - After sorting, the common prefix of the entire array will only be as long as the common prefix of the first and the last string in the sorted array.

4. **Finding the common prefix**:
   - Initialize an empty string to store the common prefix.
   - Iterate through characters of the first and last strings, comparing them:
     - If characters match, add to the prefix.
     - If characters do not match, break the loop and return the common prefix obtained so far.

### Code

```javascript
function longestCommonPrefix(strs) {
    if (strs.length === 0) return "";
    if (strs.length === 1) return strs[0];
    
    // Sort the array to bring similar items closer
    strs.sort();
    
    let prefix = "";
    let first = strs[0];
    let last = strs[strs.length - 1];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < first.length; i++) {
        if (first[i] === last[i]) {
            prefix += first[i];
        } else {
            break;
        }
    }
    
    return prefix;
}

// Test cases
console.log(longestCommonPrefix(["flower","flow","flight"])); // Output: "fl"
console.log(longestCommonPrefix(["dog","racecar","car"]));    // Output: ""
console.log(longestCommonPrefix([""]));                       // Output: ""
console.log(longestCommonPrefix(["a"]));                      // Output: "a"
console.log(longestCommonPrefix(["ab", "a"]));                // Output: "a"
```

### Time Complexity

1. **Sorting the array**: `O(n log n)` where `n` is the number of strings.
2. **Comparing the first and last string**: `O(m)`, where `m` is the length of the shortest string.

Thus, the overall time complexity is `O(n log n + m)`. This is efficient for the given constraints.
