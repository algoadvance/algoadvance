[Leetcode 851. Loud and Rich](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l851)
## Problem Statement

In a group of `n` people (labeled from `0` to `n - 1`), each person has a different amount of money, and different levels of loudness. For simplicity, let's denote:

- `richer[i] = [a, b]`  means person `a` has more money than person `b`.
- `quiet[i]` is the quietness of the `i-th` person.

Your task is to return an array answer where `answer[x] = y` means that for person `x`, the person `y` is the least quiet person among all people who are richer than `x` (or equal to `x` in terms of money).

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can there be multiple connections in the `richer` list?
2. Is there any specific constraint on the size of `n` and the elements in the `richer` and `quiet` arrays?

Assuming the input contains no cycles and is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), we can move on to the strategy and coding.

## Strategy

The key to solving this problem efficiently involves graph traversal techniques, specifically Depth-First Search (DFS).

1. **Graph Representation**: Represent the given richer relationships as a graph where edges point from a richer person to a less rich person.
2. **DFS with Memoization**:
   - Define a DFS function to find the least quiet person among people richer than or equal to the current person.
   - Use memoization to store results for subproblems to avoid redundant calculations.

### Steps in Detail:
1. **Graph Construction**:
   - Construct an adjacency list for the graph using the `richer` array.
2. **DFS with Memoization**:
   - Initialize an `answer` array of length `n` with -1 to denote unvisited nodes.
   - Use DFS to explore richer paths and find the least quiet person for each node, storing this in the `answer` array.
3. **Return the Result**:
   - After processing all nodes, return the `answer` array.

## Time Complexity
- Building the graph: O(E), where E is the number of edges in the `richer` array.
- DFS traversal: O(V + E), where V is the number of nodes and E is the number of edges in the graph.
- Overall complexity is O(V + E).

## Code

Here is the JavaScript code to solve the problem:

```javascript
var loudAndRich = function(richer, quiet) {
    const n = quiet.length;
    const graph = Array.from({ length: n }, () => []);
    
    // Build the graph
    for (const [u, v] of richer) {
        graph[v].push(u);
    }
    
    const answer = Array(n).fill(-1);
    
    const dfs = (node) => {
        if (answer[node] !== -1) {
            return answer[node];
        }

        // Initially, the least quiet person is the person itself
        let leastQuiet = node;
        for (const neighbor of graph[node]) {
            const candidate = dfs(neighbor);
            if (quiet[candidate] < quiet[leastQuiet]) {
                leastQuiet = candidate;
            }
        }

        answer[node] = leastQuiet;
        return leastQuiet;
    }
    
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        dfs(i);
    }
    
    return answer;
};
```

### Explanation:
1. **Graph Construction**: 
   - Build the graph with `graph[v].push(u)` to represent richer relationships.
2. **DFS with Memoization**:
   - For each node `i`, call DFS, which explores all richer paths to find the least quiet person.
3. **Final Result**:
   - Return the `answer` array after processing all nodes.

This approach ensures efficient traversal and computation, leveraging memoization to avoid redundant work.
