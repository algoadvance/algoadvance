[Leetcode 1400. Construct K Palindrome Strings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1400)
## Problem Statement

You're given a string `s` and an integer `k`. You need to determine if you can construct `k` palindrome strings using all the characters from `s`.

A string is a palindrome if it reads the same backward as forward. You can rearrange the string if necessary to form the palindrome strings.

Return `true` if you can use all the characters in the string to construct exactly `k` palindrome strings, otherwise return `false`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Can `k` be greater than the length of the string?**
   - Yes. In this case, it's impossible to construct `k` palindromes since a palindrome must contain at least one character.
2. **What if `k` is zero?**
   - If `k` is zero, it should always return `false`, as constructing zero palindromes with non-zero characters isn't feasible.

### Strategy

1. **Character Frequency Count**: Count the frequency of each character in the string.
2. **Odd Frequency Count**: Determine how many characters have an odd frequency.
3. **Validation**: To form `k` palindromes:
   - The number of odd frequency characters must be less than or equal to `k`. This is because each palindrome can have at most one character with an odd frequency (as the center character in the palindrome).
   - Additionally, `k` must be less than or equal to the length of the string, since we cannot form more palindromes than the characters available.

### Code

Here's the JavaScript code implementing this strategy:

```javascript
var canConstruct = function(s, k) {
    if (k > s.length) {
        return false;
    }

    let charCount = new Array(26).fill(0);
    for (let char of s) {
        charCount[char.charCodeAt(0) - 'a'.charCodeAt(0)]++;
    }

    let oddCount = 0;
    for (let count of charCount) {
        if (count % 2 !== 0) {
            oddCount++;
        }
    }

    return oddCount <= k;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Frequency Count Calculation**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- **Odd Frequency Count**: O(1), since we're iterating over a fixed array size of 26 (for each letter of the alphabet).
- Therefore, the overall time complexity is **O(n)**.

This solution efficiently determines whether it's possible to construct `k` palindromes using all characters of the given string `s`.
