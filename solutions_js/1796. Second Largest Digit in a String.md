[Leetcode 1796. Second Largest Digit in a String](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1796)
### Problem Statement:

Given an alphanumeric string `s`, return the second-largest numerical digit that appears in `s`, or `-1` if it does not exist.

Example:
```
Input: s = "dfa12321afd"
Output: 2
Explanation: The digits that appear in the string are [1, 2, 3]. The second largest digit is 2.
```

### Clarifying Questions:

1. **Q:** Should we consider only the numeric digits (0-9) for this problem?
   - **A:** Yes, only numeric digits should be considered.
   
2. **Q:** What should the function return if there are less than two unique numeric digits in the string?
   - **A:** The function should return `-1` in this case.

3. **Q:** Are the digits guaranteed to appear in a specific order?
   - **A:** No, digits can appear in any order within the string.

4. **Q:** Is the input string confined to a particular length?
   - **A:** The problem does not specify a length constraint, but it should work efficiently for reasonably long strings.

### Strategy:

1. Initialize a set to keep track of unique digits encountered in the string.
2. Traverse the string and for each character, check if it's a digit.
3. If it's a digit, add it to the set.
4. Convert the set to an array, sort it in descending order.
5. Check whether the array has at least two elements.
6. If so, return the second element; otherwise return `-1`.

### Code:

```javascript
function secondHighest(s) {
    let digitsSet = new Set();

    // Iterate through the string and add digits to the set
    for (let char of s) {
        if (char >= '0' && char <= '9') {
            digitsSet.add(char);
        }
    }

    // Convert set to an array and sort it in descending order
    let digitsArray = Array.from(digitsSet).map(Number).sort((a, b) => b - a);

    // Check if there are at least two unique digits
    if (digitsArray.length < 2) {
        return -1;
    } else {
        return digitsArray[1];
    }
}
```

### Time Complexity:

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n + m \log m)\), where \(n\) is the length of the string `s` and \(m\) is the number of unique digits found in the string. The `n` accounts for the iteration through the string, and the \(m \log m\) accounts for sorting the unique digits.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(m)\), where \(m\) is the number of unique digits, as we store them in a set and then in an array.

This solution ensures that we efficiently capture unique digits and determine the second largest one, if it exists.
