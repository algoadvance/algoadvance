[Leetcode 488. Zuma Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l488)
## Problem Statement
You are playing Zuma Game, a puzzle video game. You have a row of balls on the table, where each ball has one of 5 colors: 'R' (red), 'Y' (yellow), 'B' (blue), 'G' (green), and 'W' (white). You also have several balls in your hand of each of these 5 colors. 

Your goal is to clear all the balls on the table. A move consists of inserting a ball from your hand into the row (either before or after any existing ball), and then, if this creates a sequence of three or more consecutive balls of the same color, they will be removed. If this removal creates a new group of three or more of the same color next to each other, they will also be removed. This process is repeated until no more balls can be removed.

Find the minimum number of balls you have to insert to clear all the balls on the table. If you cannot clear all the balls, output -1. 

### Example:
```
Input:
board = "WRRBBW"
hand = "RB"
Output: -1

Input:
board = "WWRRBBWW"
hand = "WRBRW"
Output: 2

Input:
board = "G"
hand = "GGGGG"
Output: 2

Input:
board = "RBYYBBRRB"
hand = "YRBGB"
Output: 3
```

### Note:
- You may assume that the initial row of balls on the table wonâ€™t be empty.
- The number of balls on the table won't exceed 20, and the string representing the row of balls will be at most 20 characters long.
- The number of balls in your hand won't exceed 5, and the string representing these balls will be at most 5 characters long.

## Clarifying Questions
1. Can we assume that all balls in hand and on the board are valid and only contain the characters 'R', 'Y', 'B', 'G', and 'W'?
2. Are we allowed to change the order of balls in hand to find the minimum number of inserts?

## Strategy
1. **Recursion and Backtracking**:
   - We'll use a recursive function to try inserting each ball from the hand into every possible position in the board.
   - After each insertion, if three or more consecutive balls of the same color exist, we need to remove them along with any subsequent groups formed from the removals.
   - Use a hashmap to count the occurrences of each ball in hand for quick lookup.

2. **Reduce Board**:
   - Define a helper function to eliminate consecutive sequences of three or more similar balls.

3. **Base Cases**:
   - If the board is empty, return the number of steps.
   - If no more balls can be inserted (hand is empty) and the board is not empty, return -1.

4. **DFS with memoization**:
   - Use a depth-first search to try every possible move.
   - Memorize results for already explored states to avoid recalculations.

## Code

Here is the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
const findMinStep = (board, hand) => {
    let map = {};
    for (let c of hand) map[c] = (map[c] || 0) + 1;

    const removeConsecutive = (s) => {
        let start = 0;
        for (let end = 0; end <= s.length; end++) {
            if (end === s.length || s[end] !== s[start]) {
                if (end - start >= 3) return removeConsecutive(s.slice(0, start) + s.slice(end));
                else start = end;
            }
        }
        return s;
    };

    const dfs = (curBoard, curHand) => {
        if (curBoard.length === 0) return 0;
        if (Object.values(curHand).every(v => v === 0)) return -1;

        let ans = Infinity;
        for (let i = 0; i <= curBoard.length; i++) {
            for (let c in curHand) {
                if (curHand[c] === 0) continue;
                let newBoard = curBoard.slice(0, i) + c + curBoard.slice(i);
                newBoard = removeConsecutive(newBoard);
                if (curBoard.length === newBoard.length) continue;

                curHand[c]--;
                let temp = dfs(newBoard, curHand);
                if (temp !== -1) ans = Math.min(ans, temp + 1);
                curHand[c]++;
            }
        }
        return ans === Infinity ? -1 : ans;
    };

    return dfs(board, map);
};
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity is challenging to compute exactly due to the nature of recursive calls and the implicit pruning; however, it lies between exponential and factorial time in the worst case.
- **Inserts**: We have up to 5 balls in hand and can insert at various positions (normal case 20 positions, so 5 * 20 possibilities).
- **Recursion depth**: At most 5 levels.

Thus, the complexity can grow to be quite large in the general case, but pruning helps make it feasible for input constraints.
