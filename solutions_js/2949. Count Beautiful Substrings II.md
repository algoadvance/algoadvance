[Leetcode 2949. Count Beautiful Substrings II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2949)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s`, a substring of `s` is called beautiful if it contains equal numbers of letters '0' and '1'.

Write a function `countBeautifulSubstringsII` that returns the number of beautiful substrings in `s`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints:**
   - What is the length range of the input string `s`?
   - Can the string contain characters other than '0' and '1'?
   - Should we handle cases with non-binary elements or expect only '0' and '1'?

2. **Output Format:**
   - Should the function return the number of beautiful substrings as an integer?

3. **Time Complexity:**
   - Is there a desired time complexity for the solution?

Assuming:
- The input string will have a length ranging from 1 to 100,000.
- The string will be binary, containing only '0' and '1's.
- We aim to provide an efficient solution with reasonable time complexity.

## Strategy
To solve this problem, we can use the following strategy:
1. **Prefix Sum Technique:**
   - We can use a prefix sum array to keep track of the count of '0's and '1's encountered so far.
   - By calculating the difference between the counts of '0's and '1's at two indices, we can determine if the substring between those indices is beautiful.
   - We will use a hash map to count occurrences of each prefix difference, and every time we see a repeated difference, it indicates the presence of a beautiful substring.

## Code

Here is the implementation:

```javascript
function countBeautifulSubstringsII(s) {
    const n = s.length;
    const countMap = new Map();
    let balance = 0;
    let beautifulCount = 0;

    // Initial entry for zero difference
    countMap.set(0, 1);

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (s[i] === '0') {
            balance--;
        } else if (s[i] === '1') {
            balance++;
        }

        if (countMap.has(balance)) {
            beautifulCount += countMap.get(balance);
            countMap.set(balance, countMap.get(balance) + 1);
        } else {
            countMap.set(balance, 1);
        }
    }

    return beautifulCount;
}

// Example Usage:
// let s = "00110";
// console.log(countBeautifulSubstringsII(s));  // Output: 6
```

## Time Complexity
- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`. We traverse the string once and use a hash map to store prefix sums.
- **Space Complexity:** O(n), in the worst case we might store all different prefix sums.

This approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of beautiful substrings in linear time.
