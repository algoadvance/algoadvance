## Problem Statement

LeetCode Problem 2747: Count Zero Request Servers

You are given a network of servers represented as a 2D grid of integers. Each integer represents a server, with `1` meaning the server is handling requests and `0` meaning the server is not handling any requests. 

Your task is to write a function `countZeroRequestServers(grid)` that counts the number of servers that:
1. Are not handling any requests (`0`)
2. Are not in the same row or column as a server that is handling requests (`1`)

Given:
- `grid` is a list of lists of integers where each integer is either `0` or `1`
- The dimensions of the grid are at most `250 x 250`

Return the count of such servers.

### Example
```javascript
Input: grid = [
  [1, 0, 0],
  [0, 1, 0],
  [0, 0, 0]
]
Output: 1
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **What should be the output if the input grid is empty?**
   - If the input grid is empty, the answer should be `0`.

2. **Can the grid have other values apart from `0` and `1`?**
   - According to the problem statement, the grid only contains `0` and `1`.

3. **What if all servers in the grid are handling requests (`1`)?**
   - The output should be `0` since no `0` servers exist in this case.

## Strategy

1. Traverse the grid and identify the presence of servers handling requests (those marked as `1`) in each row and column.
2. Using two sets (one for rows and one for columns), we keep track of which rows and columns have at least one `1`.
3. Traverse the grid again and count the `0` servers that are in rows and columns which do not have any handling servers.

## Code

```javascript
function countZeroRequestServers(grid) {
    let rows = grid.length;
    if (rows === 0) return 0;
    let cols = grid[0].length;

    let handlingRows = new Set();
    let handlingCols = new Set();

    // Identify the rows and columns that have at least one `1`
    for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === 1) {
                handlingRows.add(i);
                handlingCols.add(j);
            }
        }
    }

    let zeroCount = 0;

    // Count the zero servers that are not in rows and columns with `1` servers
    for (let i = 0; i < rows; i++) {
        for (let j = 0; j < cols; j++) {
            if (grid[i][j] === 0 && !handlingRows.has(i) && !handlingCols.has(j)) {
                zeroCount++;
            }
        }
    }

    return zeroCount;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Identifying Rows and Columns with `1` Servers:** We traverse the entire grid once, which takes `O(rows * cols)`.
- **Counting Zero Servers:** Another traversal of the grid, which also takes `O(rows * cols)`.

Thus, the overall time complexity of the function is `O(rows * cols)`, making it efficient given the problem's constraints.

## Example Execution

For the example input:
```javascript
let grid = [
    [1, 0, 0],
    [0, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0]
];

console.log(countZeroRequestServers(grid)); // Output: 1
```
- Rows and columns containing `1`: `handlingRows = {0, 1}`, `handlingCols = {0, 1}`
- The only zero server not in these rows and columns is at position `(2,2)`, hence the output is `1`.
