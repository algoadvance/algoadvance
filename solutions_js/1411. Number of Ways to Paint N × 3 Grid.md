[Leetcode 1411. Number of Ways to Paint N × 3 Grid](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1411)
### Problem Statement

You are given a grid of size `N x 3` and you want to paint each cell of the grid with exactly one of three colors. You need to ensure that no two adjacent cells have the same color. Adjacent cells can be horizontal or vertical neighbors.

Given an integer `n`, return the number of ways you can paint this `n x 3` grid. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What are the colors available for painting?** 
   - Let's assume we have three colors, which we can denote by `r` (red), `g` (green), and `b` (blue).

2. **What defines "adjacent" cells in the problem?**
   - Adjacent cells are those that are next to each other vertically or horizontally.

3. **Is the modulo operation applied to the final result?**
   - Yes, the result should be returned modulo `10^9 + 7`.

### Strategy

Given the constraints, a dynamic programming approach is suitable. We need to define a way to capture the state of the grid at each row.

1. **State Definitions:**
   - Let's denote the state of a row by the color patterns used.
   - Group the patterns into two sets: 
     - Type A (`abc` where `a != b` and `b != c`): Every three adjacent cells in a row have distinct colors.
     - Type B (`aab` or `aba` or `abb`: Two adjacent cells share the same color, and one cell is different).
     
2. **Transition Between Rows:**
   - From one row to the next, we can transition from Type A to Type A, Type A to Type B, and so on, with specific constraints.

3. **Counting Patterns:**
   - Calculate the number of ways to paint the first row and then determine the transition rules for subsequent rows.

### Code

```javascript
var numOfWays = function(n) {
    const MOD = 10**9 + 7;
    
    // Type A and B initial counts for the first row
    let typeA = 6; // (rbg, rgb, brg, bgr, grb, gbr)
    let typeB = 6; // (rrg, rrg, rrg, ggr, bbr, brr)
    
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        let newTypeA = (3 * typeA + 2 * typeB) % MOD;
        let newTypeB = (2 * typeA + 2 * typeB) % MOD;
        
        typeA = newTypeA;
        typeB = newTypeB;
    }
    
    return (typeA + typeB) % MOD;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(n)\) because we iterate through each row once to update the state counts.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(1)\) since we are only using fixed extra space to maintain counts for types A and B.

This solution efficiently calculates the number of ways to paint an `N x 3` grid while respecting the given constraints.
