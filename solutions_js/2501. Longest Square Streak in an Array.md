[Leetcode 2501. Longest Square Streak in an Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2501)
## Problem Statement

Given an integer array `nums`, return the length of the longest square streak in `nums`.

A square streak is defined as a sequence of integers in which every number in the sequence is the square of the previous number. The length of the sequence is the number of elements in the sequence. 

If there are no such sequences, return `0`.

Example 1:

```
Input: nums = [1, 4, 16, 7, 64]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest square streak is the sequence: [1, 4, 16, 64].
```

Example 2:

```
Input: nums = [2, 3, 5, 6, 7]
Output: 0
Explanation: There are no square streaks in the array.
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the numbers in the square streak appear out of order in the input array?**
   - Yes, the numbers don't have to be in order in the input array.

2. **Can the array contain duplicate numbers?**
   - Yes, the array can contain duplicates, but each number should only be used once in a square streak to count towards the longest streak.

3. **What is the expected time complexity for the solution?**
   - An efficient solution typically operates in O(n log n) or O(n) time complexity, where `n` is the length of the input array.

## Strategy

1. **Use a Set for Fast Lookup**: Convert the array to a set for O(1) average-time complexity lookups.

2. **Iterate and Build Streaks**: For each number in the array, attempt to build the longest possible square streak by continuously squaring the number and checking if the result exists in the set.

3. **Track the Longest Streak**: Keep track of the maximum length streak found.

4. **Handle Edge Cases**: Consider cases where the input array is empty or contains only one element.

## Code

Here is the implementation based on the strategy:

```javascript
function longestSquareStreak(nums) {
    // Convert array to set for O(1) lookups
    const numSet = new Set(nums);
    
    let longestStreak = 0;

    for (let num of nums) {
        let count = 0;
        let current = num;

        while (numSet.has(current)) {
            count++;
            current = current * current;
        }

        longestStreak = Math.max(longestStreak, count);
    }

    return longestStreak > 1 ? longestStreak : 0; // Streak must be greater than 1 to be valid
}

// Example Test Cases
console.log(longestSquareStreak([1, 4, 16, 7, 64])); // Output: 4
console.log(longestSquareStreak([2, 3, 5, 6, 7])); // Output: 0
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n * log(maxNum)), where `n` is the length of the input array and `log(maxNum)` accounts for squaring numbers up to the maximum possible value.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n) due to storage in the set.
