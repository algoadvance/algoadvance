[Leetcode 2285. Maximum Total Importance of Roads](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2285)
## Problem Statement

You are given:
- An integer `n` representing the number of cities.
- A 2D array `roads` containing pairs of integers, where each pair `(a, b)` represents an undirected road connecting cities `a` and `b`.

Each city can be assigned an importance value. The importance of a road `(a, b)` is defined as the sum of the importance values of the cities `a` and `b` it connects. We need to assign an importance value to each city from `1` to `n` (all unique) in order to maximize the total importance of all the roads.

Return the maximum total importance of all the roads.

### Example

Input:
```
n = 5
roads = [[0, 1], [0, 3], [1, 2], [1, 3], [2, 3], [2, 4]]
```

Output:
```
43
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. How should cities and importance be matched?
   - Importance values from `1` to `n` must be assigned uniquely to cities to maximize the total importance of all roads.

2. Can the road configurations have duplicate entries?
   - No, each road `(a, b)` is unique.

## Strategy

To maximize the total importance of all roads, we need to assign higher importance values to cities with more connections (higher degree). Hereâ€™s the high-level approach:

1. **Calculate Degree**: Determine the degree (number of connections) for each city.
2. **Sort by Degree**: Sort cities based on their degree in descending order.
3. **Assign Importance**: Assign the highest importance value to the city with the highest degree, the next highest to the city with the second highest degree, and so on.
4. **Calculate Total Importance**: Using the assigned importance values, compute the total importance for all the roads.

## Code

```javascript
function maximumImportance(n, roads) {
    const degree = Array(n).fill(0);
    
    // Calculating the degree of each city.
    for (const [a, b] of roads) {
        degree[a]++;
        degree[b]++;
    }
    
    // Sort cities by degree in descending order, keeping track of city indices.
    const cities = Array.from({ length: n }, (_, i) => i);
    cities.sort((a, b) => degree[b] - degree[a]);
    
    // Assign importance values based on sorted order.
    const importance = Array(n).fill(0);
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        importance[cities[i]] = n - i; // Assign values 1..n in descending order
    }
    
    // Calculate total importance of all roads.
    let totalImportance = 0;
    for (const [a, b] of roads) {
        totalImportance += importance[a] + importance[b];
    }
    
    return totalImportance;
}

// Test case
const n = 5;
const roads = [
    [0, 1],
    [0, 3],
    [1, 2],
    [1, 3],
    [2, 3],
    [2, 4]
];

console.log(maximumImportance(n, roads)); // Output: 43
```

## Time Complexity

1. **Calculating the Degree** - O(m), where m is the number of roads.
2. **Sorting Cities by Degree** - O(n log n), where n is the number of cities.
3. **Assigning Importance Values** - O(n).
4. **Calculating Total Importance** - O(m).

Overall, the time complexity is O(m + n log n), which is efficient for typical input constraints.
