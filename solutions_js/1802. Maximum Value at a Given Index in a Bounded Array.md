[Leetcode 1802. Maximum Value at a Given Index in a Bounded Array](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1802)
### Problem Statement
You are given three integers `n`, `index`, and `maxSum`. You need to construct an array `nums` of length `n` where `nums[index]` is maximized, and the sum of all elements in `nums` is less than or equal to `maxSum`. Additionally, every element in `nums` must be a positive integer.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What is the range of values for `n`, `index`, and `maxSum`?
   - Generally, `1 <= n <= 10^5` and `n <= maxSum <= 10^9`.

2. Are there any constraints on the minimum or maximum values the elements in the array can have, other than them being positive integers?
   - No, all elements just need to be positive integers.

3. Does the value of the element at `index` need to strictly maximize without considering other possibilities?
   - Yes, `nums[index]` should be the highest possible value while ensuring the sum of the entire array does not exceed `maxSum`.

### Strategy
The key challenge is to maximize `nums[index]` while keeping the total sum of the array within `maxSum`. 

We can use binary search to determine the maximum value that `nums[index]` can take:
1. We'll iterate over possible values of `nums[index]` using binary search.
2. For each possible value, calculate the minimum sum of the array when `nums[index]` is set to this value.
3. If the sum is within `maxSum`, we update our answer and try a larger value. If not, we try a smaller value.

### Code

```javascript
function maxValue(n, index, maxSum) {
    function calculateSum(x) {
        // Calculate total sum of array with `index` set to `x`
        let sum = x;

        // Calculate sum of the left side
        if (x > index) {
            sum += (x - 1 + x - index) * index / 2;
        } else {
            sum += (x - 1) * x / 2 + (index - (x - 1));
        }

        // Calculate sum of the right side
        if (x > n - index - 1) {
            sum += (x - 1 + x - (n - index - 1)) * (n - index - 1) / 2;
        } else {
            sum += (x - 1) * x / 2 + ((n - index - 1) - (x - 1));
        }

        return sum;
    }

    let left = 1, right = maxSum, answer = 1;

    while (left <= right) {
        let mid = Math.floor((left + right) / 2);
        let sum = calculateSum(mid);

        if (sum <= maxSum) {
            answer = mid;
            left = mid + 1;
        } else {
            right = mid - 1;
        }
    }

    return answer;
}
```

### Explanation
1. **Binary Search Setup:** 
    - We use binary search to explore the possible values for `nums[index]`. 
    - `left` is initialized to 1 (minimum possible value for nums[index]), and `right` is initialized to `maxSum`.

2. **Sum Calculation Function:**
    - `calculateSum(x)` computes the sum of the array assuming `nums[index] = x`.
    - The function handles the sum calculation for elements to the left and right of `index`. The sum needs to respect the bounds and adjust for cases where `x` is not large enough to fill the entire range.

3. **Binary Search Execution:**
    - In the while loop, we compute the mid-point value and use `calculateSum(mid)` to verify if we can keep the array sum within `maxSum`.
    - If the sum is valid, we update the `answer` and try for a higher value (to maximize `nums[index]`).
    - If the sum exceeds `maxSum`, we try smaller values.

### Time Complexity
- **Sum Calculation Function:** O(1) since it involves a few arithmetic operations.
- **Binary Search:** O(log `maxSum`) since the binary search operation divides the range in half each iteration.

Overall, the solution runs in O(log `maxSum`), which is efficient given the constraints.
