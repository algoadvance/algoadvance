[Leetcode 1816. Truncate Sentence](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1816)
### Problem Statement

You are given a sentence `s` (a string) and an integer `k`. You need to truncate `s` such that it contains only the first `k` words. Return `s` after truncating it.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **What is considered a word in this context?**
   - A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters separated by spaces.
2. **What if `s` contains fewer than `k` words?**
   - You should return the entire string `s`.
3. **Can `k` be zero or negative?**
   - According to the problem constraints, `k` is a positive integer.

### Example
- **Input:** `s = "Hello how are you Contestant", k = 4`
- **Output:** `"Hello how are you"`

### Strategy
1. Split the string `s` by spaces to get an array of words.
2. Use the `.slice(0, k)` method to get the first `k` words from the array.
3. Join these words back into a single string with a space delimiter.

### Code
```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} s
 * @param {number} k
 * @return {string}
 */
var truncateSentence = function(s, k) {
    return s.split(' ').slice(0, k).join(' ');
};
```

### Explanation
1. **Split the String**: `s.split(' ')` splits the input string into an array of words.
2. **Slice the Array**: `.slice(0, k)` extracts the first `k` elements from the array.
3. **Join the Array**: `.join(' ')` combines the sliced array back into a single string separated by spaces.

### Time Complexity
- **Splitting the String**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- **Slicing the Array**: O(k), where `k` is the number of words to extract.
- **Joining the Array**: O(k) in the worst case if all words are of size 1.

Combining these, the overall time complexity is O(n) due to the initial string split. Since splitting dominates the operation, the other operations are relatively minor in comparison.
