[Leetcode 3015. Count the Number of Houses at a Certain Distance I](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3015)
### Problem Statement

You are given the locations of houses as an array of integers `houses`, where `houses[i]` denotes the position of the i-th house on a number line. You also have an integer `distance`. Your task is to determine the number of pairs of distinct houses `(i, j)` such that the absolute difference between the positions of house `i` and house `j` equals the given `distance`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Are the positions of the houses guaranteed to be distinct?**
    - No assumption here; positions can be distinct or the same.

2. **Does the array `houses` need to be sorted?**
    - The problem does not specify, but sorting could be a part of the strategy.

3. **Can `distance` be negative?**
    - Typically, distance is assumed to be non-negative, since it represents an absolute value.

4. **What should be the output if no pairs match the criteria?**
    - Return `0` if there are no such pairs.

5. **What are the constraints on the size of the `houses` array or the integer values?**
    - This information is not provided in the problem statement but let's assume it fits within the usual constraints of reasonable array sizes.

### Strategy

1. **Sorting and Binary Search:**
    - Sort the `houses` array for easier difference calculations.
    - Iterate through the array, for each house position, use a binary search to find if there exists another position equal to the current house position plus the given distance.

2. **Using a HashMap:**
    - Create a hashmap to keep track of the positions of houses.
    - Iterate through the `houses` array, for each position, check if there exists another position either at `position + distance` or `position - distance`.

### Code

Here is the solution using the HashMap approach:

```javascript
function countPairsWithDistance(houses, distance) {
    let count = 0;
    const positionMap = new Map();

    // Fill the map with positions
    for (const house of houses) {
        if (positionMap.has(house)) {
            positionMap.set(house, positionMap.get(house) + 1);
        } else {
            positionMap.set(house, 1);
        }
    }

    // Iterate through the houses again to count pairs
    for (const house of houses) {
        // Check for house + distance
        const target1 = house + distance;
        if (positionMap.has(target1)) {
            count += positionMap.get(house);
        }

        // Check for house - distance
        const target2 = house - distance;
        if (positionMap.has(target2)) {
            count += positionMap.get(house);
        }

        // Decrement the count for the current house in the map
        positionMap.set(house, positionMap.get(house) - 1);
    }
    
    return count;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) on average because we are using a hashmap where insertions and lookups are O(1).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) because we are storing positions in the hashmap.

This approach efficiently handles finding pairs of houses at the given distance without needing nested loops, making it suitable for larger input sizes.
