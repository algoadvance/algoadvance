[Leetcode 2771. Longest Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2771)
### Problem Statement

You are given two integer arrays `nums1` and `nums2` of the same length `n`. Calculate the length of the longest non-decreasing subarray that you can obtain by selecting `nums1[i]` or `nums2[i]` for each index `i`, where `0 <= i < n`.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Do the arrays have a positive length?**
   - Yes, you can assume that the length `n` is a positive integer.

2. **What values can `nums1` and `nums2` contain?**
   - Both arrays can contain any integer values.

3. **Should the non-decreasing subarray be contiguous in the combined/index-by-index selection?**
   - Yes, the subarray should be contiguous in the combined/index-by-index selection.

4. **How should ties be handled?**
   - We need to focus on the length of the subarray, so ties do not need special handling beyond finding the maximum length.

### Strategy

To solve the problem, a dynamic programming approach can be helpful:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Use two arrays `dp1` and `dp2` where `dp1[i]` is the length of the longest non-decreasing subarray ending at index `i` by selecting `nums1[i]` and `dp2[i]` is the length for `nums2[i]`.

2. **State Transition**:
   - For each index `i`, we consider extending the subarray from the previous index `i-1` by choosing the current element from either `nums1` or `nums2`. This depends on the values at `i-1` and the current values.

3. **Result**:
   - The result will be the maximum value from the entire `dp1` and `dp2`.

### Code

Here's how you could implement this idea:

```javascript
var maxNonDecreasingLength = function(nums1, nums2) {
    const n = nums1.length;
    let dp1 = Array(n).fill(1);
    let dp2 = Array(n).fill(1);
    let maxLength = 1;

    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        if (nums1[i] >= nums1[i-1]) {
            dp1[i] = Math.max(dp1[i], dp1[i-1] + 1);
        }
        if (nums1[i] >= nums2[i-1]) {
            dp1[i] = Math.max(dp1[i], dp2[i-1] + 1);
        }
        if (nums2[i] >= nums1[i-1]) {
            dp2[i] = Math.max(dp2[i], dp1[i-1] + 1);
        }
        if (nums2[i] >= nums2[i-1]) {
            dp2[i] = Math.max(dp2[i], dp2[i-1] + 1);
        }

        maxLength = Math.max(maxLength, dp1[i], dp2[i]);
    }

    return maxLength;
};
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity of this solution is O(n) where `n` is the length of the input arrays. This is because we are iterating through the arrays just once and performing constant time operations for each element.

The space complexity is O(n) due to the extra space required for the `dp1` and `dp2` arrays.
