[Leetcode 1931. Painting a Grid With Three Different Colors](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1931)
## Problem Statement
You are given two integers `m` and `n` representing the number of rows and columns of a grid respectively. You need to paint each cell of the grid with one of the three different colors denoted by integers `1`, `2`, and `3`. Here are the rules:
1. No two adjacent cells have the same color.
2. Two cells are considered adjacent if they share one of their four sides.

Return the number of ways you can paint this grid under the above rules. Since the answer may be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Q:** What are the minimum and maximum values for `m` and `n`?
   **A:** Both `m` and `n` are integers where `1 <= m, n <= 5`.
   
2. **Q:** Do diagonal cells need to be considered for adjacency?
   **A:** No, only cells that share one of their four sides are adjacent.

3. **Q:** Do you only need the count or also the actual configurations?
   **A:** Only the count of valid configurations.

## Strategy
To solve this problem efficiently, dynamic programming (DP) is a suitable approach due to the relatively small constraints (`1 <= m, n <= 5`) and the nature of the problem where subproblems involve solving subgrid configurations.

1. **State Representation:** Use a `DP` table where `dp[i][j]` represents the number of ways to paint the first `i` rows with the `j-th` state of the last row (a state is a specific coloring).

2. **Row States:** Precompute all valid row states (configurations for a row) with no two adjacent cells having the same color, and then use these states to build the DP table.

3. **Transition:** Use the precomputed valid states to populate the DP table by considering the compatibility between states.

4. **Modulo Operation:** Since the answer could be very large, return it modulo `10^9 + 7`.

## Code
Here is the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
const MOD = 10 ** 9 + 7;

function paintingGrid(m, n) {
    const validRows = [];
    
    // Generate all valid row states
    const generateRowStates = (row = [], lastColor = 0) => {
        if (row.length === n) {
            validRows.push([...row]);
            return;
        }
        for (let color = 1; color <= 3; color++) {
            if (color !== lastColor) {
                row.push(color);
                generateRowStates(row, color);
                row.pop();
            }
        }
    };
    
    generateRowStates();
    
    // Convert array states to bit masks for faster comparison
    const rowToMask = row => row.reduce((mask, color, index) => mask | (color << (2 * index)), 0);
    const validMasks = validRows.map(rowToMask);

    const dp = Array.from({ length: m }, () => ({}));

    // Initialize DP table with first row states
    validMasks.forEach(mask => {
        dp[0][mask] = 1;
    });

    // Populate DP table
    for (let i = 1; i < m; i++) {
        for (let currentMask of validMasks) {
            dp[i][currentMask] = 0;
            for (let prevMask of validMasks) {
                if (isValidTransition(prevMask, currentMask)) {
                    dp[i][currentMask] = (dp[i][currentMask] + dp[i - 1][prevMask]) % MOD;
                }
            }
        }
    }

    // Sum up the results for the last row
    let result = 0;
    for (let mask of validMasks) {
        result = (result + dp[m-1][mask]) % MOD;
    }

    return result;
}

// Helper function to check if two rows can be adjacent
const isValidTransition = (prevMask, currMask) => {
    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        if (((prevMask >> (2 * i)) & 3) === ((currMask >> (2 * i)) & 3)) {
            return false;
        }
    }
    return true;
};

// Example usage:
console.log(paintingGrid(1, 2)); // Example input, result should be a valid output count
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of the solution can be approximated as follows:
- Generating valid row states: \(O(3^n)\)
- Filling the DP table: \(O(m \times 3^n \times 3^n)\)

Since the maximum values for `m` and `n` are quite small, this dynamic programming approach will work efficiently within the given constraints.
