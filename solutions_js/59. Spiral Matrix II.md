[Leetcode 59. Spiral Matrix II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l59)
## Problem Statement
Given a positive integer `n`, generate an `n x n` matrix filled with elements from `1` to `n^2` in a spiral order.

---

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input constraints:** Is `n` always a positive integer?
   - Yes, `n` is always a positive integer.
   
2. **Output structure:** Should the output be a 2D array (matrix)?
   - Yes, the output should be a 2D array representing the matrix.

3. **Order requirement:** Should the numbers always start from 1 and increase up to n^2 in the spiral order?
   - Yes, the numbers should start from 1 and increase sequentially in a spiral pattern.

---

## Strategy
We will generate the `n x n` matrix by filling it with numbers from `1` to `n^2` in a spiral order. The steps to implement the spiral fill are as follows:

1. Initialize an `n x n` matrix with zeros.
2. Define the boundaries for the spiral traversal: `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right`.
3. Start filling the matrix with numbers beginning from `1` and incrementing until `n^2`.
4. Use a loop to fill numbers in the following sequence:
   - Left to Right: Fill the top row, then move the `top` boundary down.
   - Top to Bottom: Fill the right column, then move the `right` boundary left.
   - Right to Left: Fill the bottom row, then move the `bottom` boundary up.
   - Bottom to Top: Fill the left column, then move the `left` boundary right.
5. Continue the process until all cells are filled.

## Code
```javascript
function generateMatrix(n) {
    let matrix = Array.from({ length: n }, () => Array(n).fill(0));
    let num = 1;
    let top = 0, bottom = n - 1, left = 0, right = n - 1;

    while (top <= bottom && left <= right) {
        // Traverse from Left to Right
        for (let i = left; i <= right; i++) {
            matrix[top][i] = num++;
        }
        top++;

        // Traverse from Top to Bottom
        for (let i = top; i <= bottom; i++) {
            matrix[i][right] = num++;
        }
        right--;

        // Traverse from Right to Left
        if (top <= bottom) {
            for (let i = right; i >= left; i--) {
                matrix[bottom][i] = num++;
            }
            bottom--;
        }

        // Traverse from Bottom to Top
        if (left <= right) {
            for (let i = bottom; i >= top; i--) {
                matrix[i][left] = num++;
            }
            left++;
        }
    }

    return matrix;
}
```

## Time Complexity
The time complexity of this solution is **O(n^2)** because we fill each cell in the `n x n` matrix exactly once. 

The space complexity is **O(n^2)** for the matrix storage.

By following these steps, we ensure that the matrix is filled in a spiral order with the numbers from 1 to `n^2`.
