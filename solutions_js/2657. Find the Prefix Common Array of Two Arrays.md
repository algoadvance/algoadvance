[Leetcode 2657. Find the Prefix Common Array of Two Arrays](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2657)
## Problem Statement:
You are given two 0-indexed integer permutations `A` and `B` of length `n`. A prefix common array of `A` and `B` is an array `C` such that `C[i]` is the number of integers that are present in both the prefix `A[0]` to `A[i]` and `B[0]` to `B[i]`.

Return the array `C`.

### Example:
```plaintext
Input: A = [1, 3, 2, 4], B = [3, 1, 2, 4]
Output: [0, 2, 3, 4]
Explanation:
For i = 0: no integers are present in both the prefixes (A[0]=1, B[0]=3).
For i = 1: the common integers in both prefixes are 1 and 3.
For i = 2: the common integers in both prefixes are 1, 2, and 3.
For i = 3: the common integers in both prefixes are 1, 2, 3, and 4.
```

## Clarifying Questions:
1. **What are the constraints on the size of the array `n`?**
   - This could affect the choice of algorithms based on their time complexity.

2. **Can the arrays be empty or of size 1?**
   - If so, handling edge cases explicitly would be important.

3. **Are there any memory constraints?**
   - This might dictate whether we can use additional data structures like sets or hashmaps.

## Strategy:
1. **Initialization**:
   - Use two sets to track the elements seen in prefixes of `A` and `B`.

2. **Iterate through the arrays**:
   - For each index `i`, update the sets with `A[i]` and `B[i]`.
   - Compute the intersection of the sets up to that index to count the common elements.

3. **Store and return the result**:
   - Append the size of the intersection set to the result array `C`.

## Code:
```javascript
var findThePrefixCommonArray = function(A, B) {
    let prefixSetA = new Set();
    let prefixSetB = new Set();
    let prefixCommonCount = [];
    
    for (let i = 0; i < A.length; i++) {
        prefixSetA.add(A[i]);
        prefixSetB.add(B[i]);
        
        // Calculate the intersection of prefixSetA and prefixSetB
        let commonCount = 0;
        for (let num of prefixSetA) {
            if (prefixSetB.has(num)) {
                commonCount++;
            }
        }
        
        prefixCommonCount.push(commonCount);
    }
    
    return prefixCommonCount;
};
```

## Time Complexity:
- **Initialization**: O(1)
- **Iteration through arrays**: O(n)
  - For each index `i` up to `n`, we perform set operations which on average are O(1), but the subset intersection loop can take up to O(n) in the worst-case scenario.
- **Overall time complexity**: O(n^2) in the worst case due to nested loop (one for tracking up to each `i` and the other for set intersection).

## Space Complexity:
- **Sets**: O(n) for tracking elements seen in `A` and `B`.
- **Result Array**: O(n) to store the prefix common counts.
- **Overall space complexity**: O(n).
