[Leetcode 1611. Minimum One Bit Operations to Make Integers Zero](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1611)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer `n`, you need to transform it to 0 using a minimum number of operations. In one operation, you can complement any single bit of `n` from `0` to `1` or from `1` to `0`.

Return the minimum number of operations needed to transform `n` to `0`.

### Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the maximum value of `n`?
   - Are there any constraints on the minimum value of `n`?

2. **Expected Output**:
   - Should the function return an integer?
   - Are there edge cases we need to consider apart from the base ones like `n = 0`?

3. **Examples and Edge Cases**:
   - What are some example inputs and their corresponding outputs?
   - How do we handle cases where `n` is already 0?

### Strategy

Transforming an integer to `0` by flipping bits requires a step-by-step bit manipulation approach. The essence of this problem can be understood with Gray codes, where flipping a bit in place in the correct sequence minimizes the steps. A recursive approach can simplify the complexity:

1. **Base Case**: If `n` is `0`, the number of operations required is `0`.
2. **Recursive Case**: For an integer `n`, it can be broken down recursively by solving smaller subproblems.
  
Given the formula `M(n) = 1 + M((1 << (msb - 1)) ^ n)`, where `msb` is the position of the most significant bit:
- `1 << (msb - 1)` gives the bitmask for the most significant bit of `n`.
- `1 + M(...)` signifies we perform one bit flip and then solve for the recursively smaller problem.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} n
 * @return {number}
 */
var minimumOneBitOperations = function(n) {
    const memo = {};
    
    function helper(n) {
        if (n === 0) return 0;
        if (memo[n] !== undefined) return memo[n];
        
        const msb = Math.floor(Math.log2(n));  // Most significant bit position
        const nextN = (1 << msb) ^ n;  // Flip the most significant bit
        
        // Recurrence relation implementation
        const result = 1 + helper(nextN);
        
        memo[n] = result;
        return result;
    }
    
    return helper(n);
};

// Example usages:
console.log(minimumOneBitOperations(3));  // Example expected output: 2
console.log(minimumOneBitOperations(6));  // Example expected output: 4
console.log(minimumOneBitOperations(0));  // Expected output: 0
```

### Time Complexity

The time complexity for this approach is O(log n) because:
- Each recursion step reduces the problem size roughly by half.
- Operations per recursion step are O(1) due to bit manipulation operations.

This ensures that our solution is efficient even for larger values of `n`.
