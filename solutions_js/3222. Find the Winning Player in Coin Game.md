[Leetcode 3222. Find the Winning Player in Coin Game](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l3222)
## Problem Statement

You are playing a coin game against a friend. The game is played in turns, starting with Player 1. Each player can pick either 1 or 2 coins from a pile of coins, but if they pick 2 coins, they must leave at least one coin if there are any left. If a player can't make a valid move, they lose the game. The goal is to determine who will win the game if both players play optimally given a starting number of coins, `n`.

Implement the function:

```javascript
function findWinningPlayer(n) {
  // your code here
}
```

- `n`: an integer representing the initial number of coins.

The function should return `'Player 1'` if Player 1 has a winning strategy and `'Player 2'` if Player 2 has a winning strategy.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Is `n` always guaranteed to be a positive integer?
2. If a player is forced to pick the last coin, is that player considered the loser?
  
## Strategy

To determine the winning player, we can leverage dynamic programming. We'll create an array called `dp` where `dp[i]` represents whether the starting player will win given `i` coins. This array will help us break down the problem into smaller subproblems.

### Steps:

1. **Base Cases Initialization**:
    - If `n = 1`, `Player 1` picks the coin and wins. Hence, `dp[1] = true`.
    - If `n = 2`, `Player 1` can pick both coins and win. Hence, `dp[2] = true`.
    - If `n = 3`, `Player 1` can pick all 3 coins and win. Hence, `dp[3] = true`.

2. **Recursive Relation**:
    - For each `i` from 4 to `n`, `Player 1` has a winning strategy if there exists a move (picking 1 or 2 coins) leaving Player 2 in a losing position.
    - If `dp[i - 1]` or `dp[i - 2]` is false, it means `Player 2` will lose when Player 1 picks `1` or `2` coins respectively.

By building this table up to `n`, we can easily determine the optimal strategy.

## Time Complexity

The time complexity is `O(n)` since we iterate through the coins from `1` to `n`. The space complexity is also `O(n)` due to the storage required for the `dp` array.

## Code

```javascript
function findWinningPlayer(n) {
  if (n <= 0) return 'Invalid number of coins';  // Edge case handling

  // Initialize the dp array with false values
  let dp = new Array(n + 1).fill(false);

  // Base cases
  if (n >= 1) dp[1] = true;  // With 1 coin, the first player can always win
  if (n >= 2) dp[2] = true;  // With 2 coins, the first player can take both and win
  if (n >= 3) dp[3] = true;  // With 3 coins, the first player can take all and win

  // Filling dp array from 4 to n
  for (let i = 4; i <= n; i++) {
    dp[i] = !dp[i - 1] || !dp[i - 2];  // Player wins if they can force a losing situation on the opponent
  }

  // Return the result for n coins
  return dp[n] ? 'Player 1' : 'Player 2';
}
```

This implementation ensures we can determine who will win the game if both players play optimally.
