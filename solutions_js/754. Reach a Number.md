[Leetcode 754. Reach a Number](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l754)
## Problem Statement

Given a target `target`, you are at position 0 on a number line. On each move, you can either go left or right. During the i-th move (starting from 1), you take i steps.

Return the minimum number of moves required to reach the `target`.

**Example 1:**
```
Input: target = 3
Output: 2
Explanation:
On the first move, 1 step: 0 -> 1
On the second move, 2 steps: 1 -> 3
```

**Example 2:**
```
Input: target = 2
Output: 3
Explanation:
On the first move, 1 step: 0 -> 1
On the second move, 2 steps: 1 -> -1
On the third move, 3 steps: -1 -> 2
```

**Constraints:**
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9`
- Target is not necessarily positive.

## Clarifying Questions

1. If the `target` is negative, should we aim to reach `-target` instead? 
   - Yes, since the problem is symmetric for positive and negative values, we can always consider the absolute value of `target`.

2. For a lower bound of `target` as `-10^9` and upper bound as `10^9`, is the solution expected to run efficiently within these constraints?
   - Yes, the algorithm should be efficient enough to handle the full range of input values.

## Code

Here's the solution in JavaScript:

```javascript
function reachNumber(target) {
    target = Math.abs(target);  // Consider only positive target due to symmetry
    let sum = 0;
    let steps = 0;

    // Iterate until the sum is greater than or equal to the target
    while (sum < target || (sum - target) % 2 != 0) {
        steps++;
        sum += steps;
    }

    return steps;
}
```

## Strategy

1. **Normalize Target**: Since the moves are symmetric (left or right), we can consider negative `target` as positive.
2. **Accumulate Steps**: Start accumulating the steps until the sum of steps is greater than or equal to the `target`.
3. **Check Parity**: We must ensure that the difference between the accumulated `sum` and the `target` is even. This is because if the difference is even, we can adjust some positive steps to negative to reach the exact `target`.

**Example Walkthrough:**
- For `target = 3`:
  - Step 1: sum = 1 (steps = 1)
  - Step 2: sum = 3 (steps = 2) -> `sum` equals `target`
  - Hence, result is 2 steps.
  
- For `target = 2`:
  - Step 1: sum = 1 (steps = 1)
  - Step 2: sum = 3 (steps = 2) -> `sum - target` is 1 (odd)
  - Step 3: sum = 6 (steps = 3) -> `sum - target` is 4 (even)
  - Hence, result is 3 steps.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(sqrt(target))
  - The loop increases steps linearly, and the sum grows quadratically. The condition `sum >= target` will be met in about sqrt(2*target) time.
- **Space Complexity**: O(1)
  - Only a few variables are used, regardless of the input size.
