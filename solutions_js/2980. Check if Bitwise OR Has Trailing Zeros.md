[Leetcode 2980. Check if Bitwise OR Has Trailing Zeros](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2980)
## Problem Statement

Given two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, your task is to check if the bitwise OR operation between `a` and `b` results in a number that has trailing zeros. Return `true` if it does, otherwise return `false`.

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the inputs `a` and `b` be zero?**
   - Yes, both `a` and `b` can be zero.
   
2. **What is the maximum value for `a` and `b`?**
   - Assume that the maximum value for each integer is within the range of a 32-bit unsigned integer, which is \(0 \leq a, b \leq 2^{32} - 1\).

3. **What should be the output if both `a` and `b` are zero?**
   - If both are zero, the result of a bitwise OR operation is zero, which has trailing zeros, so the result should be `true`.

## Strategy

1. **Understanding Bitwise OR Operation:**
   - The bitwise OR operation between two integers results in a binary number where each bit is set to 1 if either of the corresponding bits of the operands is 1.
   
2. **Trailing Zeros:**
   - A number has trailing zeros if its last few bits are 0. Practically, we need to check if the number is divisible by some power of 2.

3. **Approach:**
   - Compute the result of the bitwise OR operation of `a` and `b`.
   - Check if the resulting number has any trailing zeros.
     - This can be achieved by testing if the number is divisible by 2, 4, 8, etc. (i.e., checking if the number & 1 gives 0 or not).

## Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {number} a
 * @param {number} b
 * @return {boolean}
 */
function hasTrailingZeros(a, b) {
    // Result of bitwise OR operation between a and b
    const orResult = a | b;

    // Check if the result has trailing zeros
    // An efficient way to check for trailing zeros is to use the expression `orResult & (orResult - 1)`
    // This clears the lowest set bit, so if the result is zero after this operation, 
    // it means that the original number had only one bit set and no trailing zeros.
    return (orResult & 1) === 0;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(hasTrailingZeros(4, 8)); // true -> (100 | 1000 -> 1100 in binary, has trailing zeros)
console.log(hasTrailingZeros(6, 7)); // false -> (110 | 111 -> 111 in binary, no trailing zeros)
console.log(hasTrailingZeros(0, 0)); // true -> (0 | 0 -> 0 in binary, has trailing zeros)
```

## Time Complexity

- The time complexity of the bitwise OR operation is \(O(1)\) since it involves a constant number of operations.
- Checking for trailing zeros using `(orResult & 1)` is also \(O(1)\).
  
Thus, the overall time complexity of this solution is \(O(1)\).
