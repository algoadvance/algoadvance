[Leetcode 1915. Number of Wonderful Substrings](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1915)
### Problem Statement

A **wonderful string** is defined as a string that contains at most one character with an odd frequency. Given a string `word`, return the number of **wonderful non-empty substrings**.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the length constraint on `word`?**
   - The length of `word` can be in the range [1, 100,000].

2. **What characters does `word` contain?**
   - The string contains only lowercase English letters.

3. **What is a substring?**
   - A substring is a contiguous block of characters within a string.

4. **What is meant by "odd frequency"?**
   - A character has an odd frequency if it appears an odd number of times in the string.

### Strategy

To solve this problem efficiently, we can use a combinatorial approach with prefix sums and bit manipulation.

1. **Bit Mask Representation**: We can use a bitmask of size 10 (for each lowercase English letter). Each bit in the mask represents the parity (even/odd) of occurrences of a given character up to that index in the string.

2. **State Transition**: As we iterate through the string, we update the current bitmask corresponding to the parity of character occurrences.

3. **Handling Wonderful Substrings**: 
   - A substring is wonderful if the bitmask either has at most one bit set.
   - For a given bitmask, we need to check if it:
     1. Matches any previous bitmask (i.e., even frequency of characters).
     2. Matches any previous bitmask with exactly one different bit (i.e., exactly one character with odd frequency).

4. **Using a HashMap**: Maintain a hashmap to store the count of each encountered bitmask and increment the count as we traverse the string.

### Code

```javascript
/**
 * @param {string} word
 * @return {number}
 */
const wonderfulSubstrings = (word) => {
    const n = word.length;
    const bitmaskCount = new Map();
    let currentMask = 0;
    let result = 0;

    // One empty prefix to handle whole substrings
    bitmaskCount.set(0, 1);

    for (let i = 0; i < n; i++) {
        // Calculate the current bitmask
        const charIndex = word.charCodeAt(i) - 97;
        currentMask ^= (1 << charIndex);

        // Check if a substring from the beginning to i is wonderful
        if (bitmaskCount.has(currentMask)) {
            result += bitmaskCount.get(currentMask);
        }

        // Check all bitmasks that differ by only one bit
        for (let j = 0; j < 10; j++) {
            let targetMask = currentMask ^ (1 << j);
            if (bitmaskCount.has(targetMask)) {
                result += bitmaskCount.get(targetMask);
            }
        }

        // Update the bitmask count
        bitmaskCount.set(currentMask, (bitmaskCount.get(currentMask) || 0) + 1);
    }

    return result;
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the input string `word`. The primary loop runs in linear time, and inside it, we perform a constant amount of work (checking 10 possible masks).
  
- **Space Complexity**: O(1), since the space used by the hashmap is bounded by a constant (2^10 possible masks).

This approach ensures that we efficiently count the number of wonderful substrings in the given string `word`.
