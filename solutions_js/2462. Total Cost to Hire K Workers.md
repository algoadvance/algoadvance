[Leetcode 2462. Total Cost to Hire K Workers](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2462)
## Problem Statement
You are given two integers `totalWorkers` and `k`, and an array `costs` where `costs[i]` is the cost to hire the `i-th` worker.

You can hire at most `totalWorkers` workers, but you want to minimize the total cost to hire exactly `k` workers. You can select any `k` workers (not necessarily contiguous).

Return the minimum total cost to hire exactly `k` workers.

## Clarifying Questions
1. **Input Constraints**:
   - What is the range of the length of `costs`?
   - What is the range of values for each cost in the `costs` array?
   - Are `totalWorkers` and the length of `costs` always greater than or equal to `k`?
2. **Output**:
   - The function should return an integer, the minimum total cost to hire exactly `k` workers.

## Strategy
1. **Sort and Select**:
   - One straightforward approach to solve this problem is:
     1. Sort the `costs` array.
     2. Select the smallest `k` costs from the sorted array.
     3. Sum up these `k` costs and return the result.

2. **Priority Queue (Heap)**:
   - This approach efficiently maintains the smallest `k` costs while processing the input array.
     1. Use a min-heap to keep track of the smallest `k` costs encountered so far.
     2. For each worker's cost, push it to the min-heap.
     3. If the heap size exceeds `k`, pop the highest (in terms of heap structure) to ensure only the smallest `k` costs remain.
     4. Sum up the elements of the heap to get the result.

We'll implement the second approach because it's more optimal in terms of time complexity.

## Time Complexity
- Sorting the array takes O(n log n).
- Using a min-heap to maintain the smallest `k` costs involves O(n log k) time complexity.
  
Given we want the minimal total cost efficiently, we'll proceed with the min-heap approach which provides O(n log k) complexity, which is better for large input sizes.

## Code

```javascript
function totalCostToHireKWorkers(totalWorkers, k, costs) {
    if (k > totalWorkers) return -1; // Edge case where not enough workers to hire

    const minHeap = new MinHeap();

    for (let cost of costs) {
        minHeap.insert(cost);
        if (minHeap.size() > k) {
            minHeap.extractMin();
        }
    }

    let totalCost = 0;
    while (minHeap.size() > 0) {
        totalCost += minHeap.extractMin();
    }

    return totalCost;
}

// MinHeap implementation for ease of understanding
class MinHeap {
    constructor() {
        this.heap = [];
    }

    insert(val) {
        this.heap.push(val);
        this.heapifyUp();
    }

    extractMin() {
        if (this.size() === 1) {
            return this.heap.pop();
        }
        const min = this.heap[0];
        this.heap[0] = this.heap.pop();
        this.heapifyDown();
        return min;
    }

    size() {
        return this.heap.length;
    }

    heapifyUp() {
        let index = this.heap.length - 1;
        while (this.parent(index) !== undefined && this.parent(index) > this.heap[index]) {
            this.swap(this.parentIndex(index), index);
            index = this.parentIndex(index);
        }
    }

    heapifyDown() {
        let index = 0;
        while (this.leftChild(index) !== undefined) {
            let smallerChildIndex = this.leftChildIndex(index);
            if (this.rightChild(index) !== undefined && this.rightChild(index) < this.leftChild(index)) {
                smallerChildIndex = this.rightChildIndex(index);
            }
            if (this.heap[index] < this.heap[smallerChildIndex]) {
                break;
            }
            this.swap(index, smallerChildIndex);
            index = smallerChildIndex;
        }
    }

    parentIndex(index) {
        return Math.floor((index - 1) / 2);
    }

    leftChildIndex(index) {
        return 2 * index + 1;
    }

    rightChildIndex(index) {
        return 2 * index + 2;
    }

    parent(index) {
        return this.heap[this.parentIndex(index)];
    }

    leftChild(index) {
        return this.heap[this.leftChildIndex(index)];
    }

    rightChild(index) {
        return this.heap[this.rightChildIndex(index)];
    }

    swap(i, j) {
        [this.heap[i], this.heap[j]] = [this.heap[j], this.heap[i]];
    }
}
```

This solution effectively prioritizes and maintains the smallest `k` worker costs in a min-heap, ensuring the solution is efficient and optimal.
