[Leetcode 116. Populating Next Right Pointers in Each Node](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l116)
## Problem Statement
You are given a perfect binary tree where all leaves are on the same level, and every parent has two children. The binary tree is defined as follows:
- struct Node {
  int val;
  Node *left;
  Node *right;
  Node *next;
}

Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to `NULL`.

Initially, all next pointers are set to `NULL`.

**Example:**

Given the following perfect binary tree:
```
       1
     /  \
    2    3
   / \  / \
  4  5  6  7
```
After calling your function, the tree should look like:
```
       1 -> NULL
     /  \
    2 -> 3 -> NULL
   / \  / \
  4->5->6->7 -> NULL
```

## Clarifying Questions
1. Should we modify the tree in place?
   - Yes, modify the tree in place.
2. Can we assume that the tree is always perfect (i.e., all leaves at the same level and every parent has two children)?
   - Yes, assume the input is always a perfect binary tree.

## Strategy
- We can use a level-order traversal to connect the nodes at each level.
- Using a queue, we will traverse the tree level by level, connecting the `next` pointers as we go.

Alternative Strategy without extra space:
- Use the already established `next` pointers to traverse the tree using O(1) space (excluding recursion stack).

Let's implement both solutions:

## Code: Using Level Order Traversal (Queue)
```javascript
function connect(root) {
    if (!root) return root;
    
    const queue = [root];
    
    while (queue.length > 0) {
        let size = queue.length;
        
        for (let i = 0; i < size; i++) {
            let node = queue.shift();
            
            if (i < size - 1) {
                node.next = queue[0];
            }
            
            if (node.left) queue.push(node.left);
            if (node.right) queue.push(node.right);
        }
    }
    
    return root;
}
```

## Code: Using Next Pointers with O(1) Space
```javascript
function connect(root) {
    if (!root) return root;
    
    let leftmost = root;
    
    while (leftmost.left) {
        let head = leftmost;
        
        while (head) {
            // Connect left child to right child
            head.left.next = head.right;
            
            // Connect right child to next's left child
            if (head.next) {
                head.right.next = head.next.left;
            }
            
            // Move to next node in current level
            head = head.next;
        }
        
        // Move to the first node of the next level
        leftmost = leftmost.left;
    }
    
    return root;
}
```

## Time Complexity
Both solutions operate in O(n) time complexity:
- The level order traversal (queue-based approach) visits each node once.
- The optimized O(1) space solution also visits each node once, linking pointers efficiently within each level.

The space complexity for the queue approach is O(n), where n is the number of nodes in the tree. The O(1) space approach only uses a few extra pointers and therefore has a constant space complexity, excluding the recursion stack (which is O(log n) due to the height of the tree).
