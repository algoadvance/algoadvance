[Leetcode 2894. Divisible and Non](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2894)
## Problem Statement

You are given an array `nums` of integers and an integer `k`. Your goal is to calculate the absolute difference between the sum of elements in `nums` that are divisible by `k` and the sum of elements in `nums` that are not divisible by `k`.

Write a function `difference(nums: number[], k: number): number` that returns this absolute difference.

### Example
```javascript
Input: nums = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9], k = 3
Output: 7
Explanation: 
Sum of elements divisible by 3 = 3 + 9 = 12
Sum of elements not divisible by 3 = 1 + 2 + 4 + 5 = 12
Absolute difference = |12 - 10| = 7
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Input Validation:**
   - Should we handle cases where `nums` is empty?
   - Should we handle cases where `k` is 0?

2. **Output**
   - What should be the value returned if no elements are divisible or non-divisible by `k`?

## Code

### Strategy

1. **Initialize two sums:**
   - `sumDivisible` for elements divisible by `k`.
   - `sumNonDivisible` for elements not divisible by `k`.

2. **Iterate through `nums`:**
   - Add each element to `sumDivisible` if it's divisible by `k`.
   - Otherwise, add it to `sumNonDivisible`.

3. **Calculate the absolute difference** between `sumDivisible` and `sumNonDivisible`.

4. **Return the result.**

### Implementation

```javascript
function difference(nums, k) {
    if (k === 0) {
        throw new Error("k cannot be 0");
    }

    let sumDivisible = 0;
    let sumNonDivisible = 0;

    for (let num of nums) {
        if (num % k === 0) {
            sumDivisible += num;
        } else {
            sumNonDivisible += num;
        }
    }

    return Math.abs(sumDivisible - sumNonDivisible);
}

// Example usage:
console.log(difference([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 9], 3));  // Output: 7
```

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** `O(n)` - where `n` is the number of elements in `nums`. We iterate through the array once.
- **Space Complexity:** `O(1)` - We use a constant amount of extra space for the sums and loop variables.

This function should work efficiently even for large input arrays and provides the required solution.
