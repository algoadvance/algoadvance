[Leetcode 524. Longest Word in Dictionary through Deleting](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l524)
### Problem Statement

Given a string `s` and a string array `dictionary`, return the longest string in the dictionary that can be formed by deleting some of the given string characters. If there is more than one possible result, return the longest word with the smallest lexicographical order. If there is no possible result, return the empty string.

### Clarifying Questions

1. **What is the maximum length of the string `s`?**
   - The length of the string `s` can go up to 1000.

2. **What is the maximum size and length of the `dictionary` array?**
   - The `dictionary` array can contain up to 1000 words and each word can be up to 1000 characters long.

3. **Will the dictionary always contain only lowercase letters?**
   - Yes, both `s` and words in `dictionary` will consist of only lowercase letters.

4. **Can we assume that we have to optimize for both time and space complexity?**
   - Yes, providing an efficient solution is important given the constraints.

### Strategy

To solve this problem, we need to:

1. **Sort the dictionary**: Sort the `dictionary` array first by the length of the words in descending order and then lexicographically in ascending order for words of the same length. This ensures that we are checking the longest words first and for words of the same length, the lexicographically smallest one will be considered first.

2. **Check Subsequence**: For each word in the sorted dictionary, check if it is a subsequence of `s`. To do this efficiently, use a two-pointer technique:
   - One pointer to iterate over `s`
   - One pointer to iterate over the current word in the dictionary
   
   If we can match the current word entirely using characters in `s` in order, it is a valid subsequence.

3. **Select the First Valid Word**: The first word that is a valid subsequence will be the answer as it ensures the longest and lexicographically smallest word.

### Code

```javascript
function findLongestWord(s, dictionary) {
    // Sort dictionary by the length of words in descending order
    // and lexicographically in ascending order for words of the same length
    dictionary.sort((a, b) => {
        if (a.length !== b.length) {
            return b.length - a.length;
        } else {
            return a.localeCompare(b);
        }
    });

    // Function to check if word is a subsequence of s
    function isSubsequence(word, s) {
        let i = 0, j = 0;
        while (i < s.length && j < word.length) {
            if (s[i] === word[j]) {
                j++;
            }
            i++;
        }
        return j === word.length;
    }

    // Iterate through the sorted dictionary to find the longest valid subsequence
    for (let word of dictionary) {
        if (isSubsequence(word, s)) {
            return word;
        }
    }

    return "";
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Sorting the dictionary**: O(m log m), where `m` is the length of the dictionary array.
- **Checking subsequences**: For each word, the worst-case time complexity is O(n), where `n` is the length of string `s`. Thus, checking all words in the dictionary would be O(m * n).

Overall, the time complexity of this solution is O(m log m + m * n).

### Space Complexity

The space complexity is O(1) excluding the space used for the input and output, as we are not using any extra space proportional to the size of the input for our logic.

This solution should efficiently handle the constraints provided in the problem.
