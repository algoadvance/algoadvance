[Leetcode 1696. Jump Game VI](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1696)
## Problem Statement

You are given a **0-indexed** integer array `nums` and an integer `k`.

You are initially standing at index `0` and you can jump to any index `i` such that `0 < i <= k`. You want to reach the last index of the array (index `n-1`). Your score is defined as the sum of `nums` at every index you visit. Return the **maximum score** you can get.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Is it guaranteed that `nums` has at least one element?
    - Yes, constraints often include `1 <= nums.length` so the array will have at least one element.
    
2. Will `nums` contain negative numbers?
    - Yes, `nums` can contain negative numbers.

3. Is it possible to have large values of `k` relative to the length of `nums`?
    - Yes, `k` could be quite large, and it can be up to `10^5`.

## Strategy

Given the constraints and requirements, this problem translates well to a dynamic programming (DP) solution utilizing a deque (double-ended queue) to track the indices of the maximum values effectively within a sliding window.

### Approach

1. **Initialization**: 
    - Create a DP array `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the maximum score you can get reaching index `i`.
    - Initialize `dp[0]` with `nums[0]` because you start there.

2. **Deque for Sliding Window Maximum**:
    - Maintain a deque to store indices of elements in `dp`. The indices in the deque will be in decreasing order of their `dp` values.
    - Ensure that the difference between the current index `i` and any index stored in the deque is less than or equal to `k` to respect the jump limit.

3. **DP Transition**:
    - For every index `i` from `1` to `n-1`:
        - Remove indices from the deque if they are outside the window of `i-k`.
        - The maximum value in the current window will be at the front of the deque.
        - Compute `dp[i]` as the sum of `nums[i]` and the `dp` value of the deque front.
        - Remove elements from the deque from the back while preserving the decreasing order property before adding the current index `i`.

4. **Final Result**:
    - The value at `dp[n-1]` will give the maximum score achievable to reach the last index.

### Code

```javascript
var maxResult = function(nums, k) {
    let n = nums.length;
    let dp = new Array(n).fill(0);
    dp[0] = nums[0];
    
    // Deque to store indices of the `dp` array
    let deque = [0];
    
    for (let i = 1; i < n; i++) {
        // Remove out of window indices
        if (deque[0] < i - k) {
            deque.shift();
        }
        
        // Update dp[i]
        dp[i] = nums[i] + dp[deque[0]];
        
        // Maintain decreasing order in deque
        while (deque.length > 0 && dp[i] >= dp[deque[deque.length - 1]]) {
            deque.pop();
        }
        
        // Add current index to deque
        deque.push(i);
    }
    
    return dp[n-1];
};
```

### Time Complexity

- **Initialization**: O(n) for creating the `dp` array.
- **Main Loop**: Each index `i` is processed once, and each index can enter and leave the deque once. Therefore, operations involving the deque take O(1) on average.

Overall, the time complexity is **O(n)**.
