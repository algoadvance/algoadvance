[Leetcode 119. Pascals Triangle II](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l119)
### Problem Statement

Given an integer `rowIndex`, return the `rowIndex`th (0-indexed) row of the Pascal's triangle.

In Pascal's triangle, each number is the sum of the two numbers directly above it.

**Example:**

```plaintext
Input: rowIndex = 3
Output: [1,3,3,1]
```

**Constraints:**

- `0 <= rowIndex <= 33`

### Clarifying Questions

1. Do we need to generate the entire Pascal's triangle up to the given row, or just return the specific row?
   - Just return the specific row.
2. How do we handle the base cases like `rowIndex = 0` or `rowIndex = 1`?
   - For `rowIndex = 0`, return `[1]`. For `rowIndex = 1`, return `[1, 1]`.
   
Given the constraints, the `rowIndex` being up to 33 is manageable within typical computational limits.

### Strategy

We can generate the desired row iteratively. Pascal's triangle can be generated by starting with the row `[1]` and iteratively building each subsequent row by summing adjacent elements of the previous row.

1. Initialize the first row as `[1]`.
2. For each subsequent row, build the new row using the previous row:
   - Start with `[1]`.
   - For each element in the row, add the sum of elements `row[i-1][j-1]` and `row[i-1][j]` from the previous row.
   - End with `[1]`.
3. Continue until reaching the desired `rowIndex`.

### Code

```javascript
function getRow(rowIndex) {
    let row = [1];
    for (let i = 1; i <= rowIndex; i++) {
        for (let j = i - 1; j > 0; j--) {
            row[j] = row[j] + row[j - 1];
        }
        row.push(1);
    }
    return row;
}

// Example usage:
console.log(getRow(3)); // Output: [1, 3, 3, 1]
```

### Explanation

- We start with the first row `[1]`.
- On each iteration, we update the row by looping from the end towards the beginning to avoid overwriting values we still need to use.
- We end each row with `1` as the last element.
- The outer loop runs from 1 to `rowIndex` which ensures that we build up to the required row.

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** \(O(k^2)\), where \(k\) is the `rowIndex`. This is because for each row up to `rowIndex`, we perform a number of operations linear to the row number.
- **Space Complexity:** \(O(k)\), as we are only storing the row of length `k` at the end.

This solution is efficient and meets the constraints provided.
