[Leetcode 2202. Maximize the Topmost Element After K Moves](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l2202)
### Problem Statement
Given an integer array `nums` and a positive integer `k`, you can perform the following operations exactly **k** times:
- Pick a positive integer `i` such that `1 <= i <= n`.
- Remove the element at index `i-1` (0-based index) from `nums`.

If the array has fewer than `k` elements, you also fail the process. Your goal is to maximize the element on the top of the array after exactly `k` operations.

Return the **maximum possible value** of the top element after exactly `k` operations. If there are no elements in the array after exactly `k` operations, return -1.

### Clarifying Questions
1. What exactly does "topmost element" mean in the context of this problem? 
   - The topmost element refers to the first element of the array after performing k operations.

2. What should happen if `k` is greater than or equal to the length of `nums`?
   - If `k` is greater than the length of `nums` and numbers of operations exactly lead to an empty list, we should return `-1`.

### Strategy
1. **Initial Check**: If `k` is greater than or equal to the length of `nums`, then it's possible that we can perform `k` operations that result in the array being empty. To handle this:
   - If `k > nums.length`, return `-1`.
   - If `k == nums.length`, pop all the elements and return the last one.
   - If `k < nums.length`, proceed with the strategy.

2. **Edge Case Handling**:
   - When `k == 0`, the array remains unchanged, return `nums[0]`.

3. **Maximization Approach**:
   - If `k < nums.length`:
     - Consider all elements that can stay as the top element after `k-1` moves, i.e., elements from index `0` to index `k`.
     - Enumerate the maximum among these elements that can potentially be the topmost element.
   - Special Case where `k-1` exactly removes all but one, consider the next element too.

### Time Complexity:
The time complexity for the solution is O(k) since we will at most be checking `k` elements.

### Code

```javascript
function maximumTop(nums, k) {
    const n = nums.length;
    
    // Edge case: If k is 0, just return the first element
    if (k == 0) return nums[0];
    
    // Edge case: If there's only one element and k is odd, we cannot make it the top element again and we return -1
    if (n == 1) {
        return (k % 2 == 0) ? nums[0] : -1;
    }
    
    // If k is larger than or equal to the length of the array,
    // We can potentially empty the array or check just the largest in the first k-1 elements
    let maxTop = -1;
    for (let i = 0; i < Math.min(k, n); i++) {
        if (i != k - 1) {
            maxTop = Math.max(maxTop, nums[i]);
        }
    }
    
    // We need to handle the case when we might leave out the element at index k if it exists
    if (k < n) {
        maxTop = Math.max(maxTop, nums[k]);
    }
    
    return maxTop;
}
```

This solution primarily focuses on iterating through a limited set of `k` elements in the nums array and ensuring that the correct edge cases are handled.
