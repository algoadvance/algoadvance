[Leetcode 820. Short Encoding of Words](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l820)
## Problem Statement

Given a list of words, you need to find the minimum length of a string that encodes all the given words. Encoding is done by concatenating the list of words and appending a '#' character at the end of each word. 

For example, if the words are ['time', 'me', 'bell'], one possible encoding would be `time#bell#` where 'me' is a substring of 'time' and does not need a separate encoding.

You need to implement a function:
```javascript
function minimumLengthEncoding(words) {
    // Your code here
}
```
This function will return the length of the minimum encoding string that encodes all the given words.

## Clarifying Questions

1. Should we consider uppercase and lowercase letters as distinct?
2. Can we assume that the input list of words will always be non-empty and contain valid strings?
3. Are there any constraints on the length or the number of words?

## Strategy

1. **Filter out suffixes**: To ensure we are not redundantly encoding suffixes of other words, we need to find words that are not suffixes of other words.
2. **Set-based approach**: We can utilize a `Set` to efficiently filter out words that are suffixes of other words. This involves:
   1. Adding all words to a set.
   2. Iterating through each word and removing all its possible suffixes from the set.
3. **Calculate length**: After filtering out redundant words, the resulting set contains the unique words that need separate encoding. The total length will be the sum of the lengths of these words plus one '#' character for each.

## Code

```javascript
function minimumLengthEncoding(words) {
    const set = new Set(words);
    
    for (const word of words) {
        for (let i = 1; i < word.length; i++) {
            set.delete(word.substring(i));
        }
    }
    
    let length = 0;
    for (const word of set) {
        length += word.length + 1; // plus 1 for the '#' character
    }
    
    return length;
}
```

## Time Complexity

- **Adding words to the set**: O(N), where N is the number of words.
- **Removing suffixes**: For each word of average length M, there are M iterations. Thus, this step takes O(N * M) time in the worst case.
- **Calculating length**: This involves iterating over the set of words, which is O(N).

Therefore, the overall time complexity is roughly O(N * M), where N is the number of words and M is the average length of the words.
