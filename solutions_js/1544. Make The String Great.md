[Leetcode 1544. Make The String Great](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1544)
## Problem Statement

Given a string `s` of lower and upper case English letters. 

A string is "great" if:
- It does not contain two adjacent characters `s[i]` and `s[i + 1]` where:
  - `0 <= i <= s.length - 2`
  - `s[i]` is a lower-case letter and `s[i + 1]` is the same letter but in upper-case or vice-versa. In other words, we want to make sure that after removing such pairs, the resulting string is "great".

To make the string great, you can repeatedly remove such pairs from the string. The function should return the final great string resulting after removing all such pairs.

### Example:
```
Input: s = "leEeetcode"
Output: "leetcode"

Input: s = "abBAcC"
Output: ""

Input: s = "s"
Output: "s"
```

## Clarifying Questions

1. **Can the input string `s` be empty?**
   - Yes, it can be. If it's empty, the output should also be an empty string.
  
2. **What is the maximum length of the string `s`?**
   - The length of the string is up to 100 characters.

3. **Are there any constraints on the character types in `s`?**
   - The string consists only of lowercase and uppercase English letters.

## Strategy

1. Use a stack to help facilitate the removal of adjacent characters.
2. Iterate over the characters in the string:
   - For each character, determine if it can be paired with the top of the stack:
     - If it's an uppercase version of the top lowercase character or vice-versa, pop the stack (remove the last character in the stack).
     - Otherwise, push the character onto the stack.
3. The stack will eventually contain the characters of the resultant "great" string.
4. Convert the stack back to a string and return the result.

## Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n), where n is the length of the input string. We iterate through the string at most twice (once for reading characters, and popping/pushing operations take O(1)).
- **Space Complexity:** O(n) in the worst case, where no characters are removed and the stack grows to the size of the input string.

## Code

Here's the implementation in JavaScript:

```javascript
function makeGood(s) {
    let stack = [];
    
    for (let char of s) {
        if (stack.length > 0 && 
            ((char === stack[stack.length - 1].toUpperCase() && char === char.toLowerCase()) ||
             (char === stack[stack.length - 1].toLowerCase() && char === char.toUpperCase()))) {
            stack.pop();
        } else {
            stack.push(char);
        }
    }
    
    return stack.join('');
}

// Test cases
console.log(makeGood("leEeetcode")); // Output: "leetcode"
console.log(makeGood("abBAcC")); // Output: ""
console.log(makeGood("s")); // Output: "s"
```
