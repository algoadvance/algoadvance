[Leetcode 1519. Number of Nodes in the Sub](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1519)
### Problem Statement:
You are given a tree (i.e., a connected, undirected graph with no cycles) consisting of `n` nodes numbered from `0` to `n - 1` and exactly `n - 1` edges. The root of the tree is the node `0`, and each node has a label which is a lowercase character given in the string `labels`.

The `ith` edge connects the nodes `edges[i][0]` and `edges[i][1]`.

Return an array of size `n` where `ans[i]` is the number of nodes in the subtree of the `ith` node which have the same label as node `i`.

### Example:
```
Input: n = 7, edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]], labels = "abaedcd"
Output: [2,1,1,1,1,1,1]
```

### Clarifying Questions:
1. Can the labels string have any non-lowercase characters?
   - No, the problem statement ensures that all labels are lowercase alphabetic characters.

2. How large can n be?
   - The value of `n` can go up to 10^5.

3. Is the input tree guaranteed to be connected and acyclic?
   - Yes, by definition of a tree, it is connected and acyclic.

### Strategy:
1. **Graph Construction**: Construct an adjacency list to represent the tree from the given edges list.
2. **DFS Traversal**: Implement a Depth First Search (DFS) to traverse the tree. While traversing, count the frequency of labels in the subtrees.
3. **Count Aggregation**: Use an array to keep track of subtree label frequencies. For each node, aggregate the results into the main result array as you backtrack in the DFS.

### Code:
```javascript
const countSubTrees = (n, edges, labels) => {
    const adjList = Array.from({length: n}, () => []);
    edges.forEach(([u, v]) => {
        adjList[u].push(v);
        adjList[v].push(u);
    });

    const result = Array(n).fill(0);
    const visited = Array(n).fill(false);

    const dfs = (node) => {
        const count = Array(26).fill(0);  // There are 26 lowercase letters
        count[labels.charCodeAt(node) - 97] = 1;

        visited[node] = true;
        
        adjList[node].forEach(neighbor => {
            if (!visited[neighbor]) {
                const subCount = dfs(neighbor);
                for (let i = 0; i < 26; i++) {
                    count[i] += subCount[i];
                }
            }
        });
        
        result[node] = count[labels.charCodeAt(node) - 97];
        return count;
    };

    dfs(0);
    return result;
};

// Example usage:
const n = 7;
const edges = [[0,1],[0,2],[1,4],[1,5],[2,3],[2,6]];
const labels = "abaedcd";
console.log(countSubTrees(n, edges, labels));  // Output: [2,1,1,1,1,1,1]
```

### Time Complexity:
- **Graph Construction**: O(n) as we process each edge once.
- **DFS Traversal**: O(n) as each node is visited once.
- **Overall**: O(n) as both constructing the graph and performing DFS are linear operations concerning the number of nodes.

The solution effectively leverages depth-first traversal to maintain and propagate count data through the tree efficiently.
