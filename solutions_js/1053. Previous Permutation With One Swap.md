[Leetcode 1053. Previous Permutation With One Swap](https://algoadvance.github.io/algoadvance/l1053)
### Problem Statement

You are given an integer array `arr`. You can choose a single index `i` and swap `arr[i]` with any of its previous indices `j` (0 ≤ j < i). Return the lexicographically largest permutation that is smaller than `arr`. If it is not possible, return the same array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: arr = [3,2,1]
Output: [3,1,2]
Explanation: Swapping 2 and 1.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: arr = [1,1,5]
Output: [1,1,4]
Explanation: No need to swap as the array is already in lexicographical order.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: arr = [1,9,4,6,7]
Output: [1,7,4,6,9]
Explanation: Swapping 9 and 7.
```

### Clarifying Questions

1. **Q:** Can the input array contain duplicates?
   **A:** Yes, the input array can contain duplicates.

2. **Q:** What is the size range of the input array?
   **A:** The size of the array can range from 1 to 10^4.

3. **Q:** Is the input array guaranteed to be non-empty?
   **A:** Yes, the input array is guaranteed to be non-empty.

4. **Q:** Are there negative numbers in the array?
   **A:** Yes, the array can contain negative numbers as well.

### Strategy

To approach this problem, we need to find the lexicographically largest permutation which is still smaller than the current permutation. Here’s one way to do it:

1. **Find 'i' to swap:** Traverse the array from right to left to find the first index `i` such that `arr[i] > arr[i-1]`. This ensures that swapping can potentially create a smaller permutation.
   
2. **Find 'j' to swap with i:** From the elements to the left of `arr[i]`, find the largest index `j` such that `arr[j] < arr[i]`.

3. **Swap elements:** Swap `arr[i]` with `arr[j]`.

4. **Edge cases:** If no such pair `i,j` exists, the array is already the smallest permutation possible, and we return it as is.

### Code

```javascript
function prevPermOpt1(arr) {
    let n = arr.length;

    // Step 1: Find the index 'i' from right to left
    let i;
    for (i = n - 1; i > 0; i--) {
        if (arr[i] < arr[i - 1]) {
            break;
        }
    }

    // If no such 'i' exists, the array is already the smallest permutation
    if (i === 0) return arr;

    // Step 2: Identify the index 'j' where arr[j] < arr[i - 1]
    let j = i - 1;
    for (let k = n - 1; k > j; k--) {
        if (arr[k] < arr[j] && arr[k] !== arr[k - 1]) {
            [arr[j], arr[k]] = [arr[k], arr[j]];
            break;
        }
    }

    return arr;
}
```

### Time Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** O(n) — We traverse the array to find `i` and another traversal to find `j`. Both operations are linear.
- **Space Complexity:** O(1) — No extra space is used except for a few variables.

This solution efficiently finds the lexicographically largest permutation smaller than the given array by utilizing a greedy approach in linear time.
